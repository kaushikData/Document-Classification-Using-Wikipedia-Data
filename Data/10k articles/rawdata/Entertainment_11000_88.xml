'''''Adventures in the Screen Trade''''' is a book about [[Hollywood]] written in 1983 by American novelist and screenwriter [[William Goldman]]. The title is a [[pun]] on [[Dylan Thomas]]'s ''Adventures in the Skin Trade''.

==Overview==
The book is divided into three parts. "Part One: Hollywood Realities" is a collection of essays on various subjects ranging from movie stars and studio executives to his thoughts on how to begin and end a screenplay and how to write for a movie star.

"Part Two: Adventures" has stories from 11 projects that Goldman has been involved with, from ''[[Charly]]'' and ''[[Masquerade (1965 film)|Masquerade]]'', to the Academy Award-winning ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' and ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', to some projects that remained unrealised, such as a musical remake of ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]''.

In "Part Three: Da Vinci", Goldman shows the reader how he would go about adapting his own short story "Da Vinci" into a screenplay. The full text of "Da Vinci" and the subsequent screenplay that he wrote are included, followed by interviews with key movie industry figures, including director [[George Roy Hill]], cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]], and composer [[Dave Grusin]].

==Background==
In the late 1970s, Goldman did hours of interviews with John Brady for a book that became ''The Craft of the Screenwriter'' (1981). Some of Goldman's answers were edited into a magazine piece for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''; this was read by an editor at a publishing house who contacted him about writing a book on screenwriting. Goldman agreed and hired Brady to work on the book with him, getting Brady to interview him over several sessions. These conversations were taped and transcribed, which Goldman used as the basis for the book.&lt;ref&gt;Egan p 177-178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book became a best seller and has since become recognized as an industry classic.&lt;ref&gt;Egan p 182&lt;/ref&gt; Art Kleiner wrote, "This is one of the three most engrossing 'creative confessional' books I've ever read." &lt;ref name= "AK"&gt;{{cite journal |url= |last= Kleiner |first= Art |title= Adventures in the Screen Trade |journal= [[Whole Earth Review]] |location= San Francisco |publisher= [[Point Foundation (environment)|Point Foundation]] |date= Summer 1987 |page= 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''backup band''' or '''backing band''' is a [[Band (music)|musical ensemble]] that [[Accompaniment|accompanies]] a [[lead singer]] at a live performance or on a [[sound recording|recording]].&lt;ref name="CampbellBrody2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Campbell|author2=James Brody|title=Rock and roll: an introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=14 December 2010|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-534-64295-2|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2017}} A backup band can also accompany an instrumental soloist, such as a [[lead guitarist]] or solo [[fiddler]], though [[instrumental music|all-instrumental]] performances, with no singing, are not common in [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]]. This can either be an established, long-standing group that has little or no change in membership, or it may be an [[ad hoc]] group assembled for a single show or a single recording.{{or|date=September 2017}} Ad hoc or "pickup" groups are often made up of [[session musician]]s.

'''''Batman: Vengeance''''' is a {{vgy|2001}} [[video game]] that was released on all major platforms of the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation of console games]]. It was developed and published by [[Ubi Soft]] in conjunction with [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] and [[DC Comics]].

The game is based on the television series ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', itself a successor to the widely acclaimed ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. In the game, Batman finds himself entangled in a web of his villains' schemes while attempting to stop the Joker's plan to destroy Gotham City.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
Based on most of the game's character designs and appearances, ''Batman Vengeance'' would seem to take place after the conclusion of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', but before the start of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. Plot points that support this include [[Mr. Freeze]] still posing as a threat (as his appearance in ''The New Batman Adventures'' episode "Cold Comfort" was the last time he was seen prior to ''[[Batman Beyond]]''), as well as the fact that [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] is the Dark Knight's only active sidekick in the game.

[[Batman]] by this point is well established as the guardian of [[Gotham City]], with the game sharing the voice cast, production design, and continuity of the [[DC animated universe]]. During the course of the game, Batman is monitored and assisted by Batgirl in the [[Batcave]].

===Plot===
After saving the life of a woman named Mary Flynn from an apparent attempted murder at the hands of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] at Gotham Chemical, which resulted in the complex blowing up due to a ticking time bomb left next to a tied up Mary by the Joker, Batman investigates what possible interest his nemesis would have in the woman. He learns that Joker had abducted her son, Toby, and is holding him for a $5 million ransom and will kill both Mary and her son if she does not pay up soon, implying that Mary has high financial access. After Mary is abducted by Joker's gang for the second time, Batman traces her location, using a tracker he previously gave to her, to a partially demolished Gotham bridge, where he comes face-to-face with the Joker once more. As the Joker seems to throw Mary's son off the remains of the bridge, the Dark Knight saves the boy before it's revealed to be a dummy, and Mary reveals herself to be the Joker's companion [[Harley Quinn]]; Toby was never real and the abduction was merely a farce to lure Batman into a trap. Batman then engages the Joker and defeats him, but in the fray, the villain falls off the bridge and to his apparent death. After saving Harley from attempting suicide by jumping off the bridge, Batman lets a distraught Quinn go and monitors her activities, knowing that the Joker is most likely not dead and Harley could be his only opportunity to learn more of the Clown Prince of Crime's true plans, making her a more valuable asset on the outside than she would be incarcerated.

As Batman continues to keep tabs over Harley, he is alerted to a crisis at a pharmaceutical company, Gotham Industrial, which is under attack by [[Mr. Freeze]], who is angrily searching the complex for a scientist named Isaac Evers, whom he believes sent him a promotional video for a drug developed by Evers, known as Promethium, for treating conditions on the cryogenically frozen. Freeze had apparently used the drug on himself and his wife, Nora, but to no avail, infuriating Freeze with the implication that Evers had sent him the tape to taunt him. After finding Evers, Freeze abducts him and escapes the complex in a helicopter. Batman gives chase in the [[Batplane|Batwing]] and eventually rescues Evers, who explains his work and what Freeze was after, lying to Batman by telling him the source of his funding originates from a grant supplied by the Wayne foundation. Knowing this to be a lie, Batman tells Evers to go into hiding, and later returns to Gotham Industrial to learn more about the source of Issac's financial backing, eventually learning that the scientist had his funding pulled, due to Promethium being far too unstable, as it contains several flammable particles. Evers was able to successfully continue in his research after receiving funding from the Joker, with every rise in Evers' budget coinciding with a successful bank heist of Joker's doing, implying the villain had plans of his own for the drug. Freeze and his gang then attack the facility again to find Isaac, destroying most of Ever's lab in the process, but are eventually stopped by the Dark Knight, with Freeze encased in ice from his own freeze gun.

Meanwhile, Batgirl traces the transmitter, previously given to Harley Quinn by Batman when he believed her to be Mary Flynn, and finds it on Gotham's mayor, Hamilton Hill, who is seen making a deal with a mysterious and large man in a trench coat. Batgirl tracks the man to a metro train, but is discovered and attacked as Batman races to assist. As Batman reaches Batgirl and her attacker, the man jumps off the train and tears away in a stolen car. Batman and Batgirl pursue their suspect in the [[Batmobile]], and cause it to crash off a highway outside the city. Batman investigates the wreckage, but discovers the man got away and finds only an apple outside the wreckage.

Back at the Batcave, Batgirl examines the apple found at the crash and discovers a live plant inside, coming to the conclusion that [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] had implanted such a creature inside the mayor and is blackmailing him for money and power. Batman's surveillance of Mayor Hill leads him back to Gotham Chemical, where he confronts the trench-coated thug, who is revealed to be a plant creature created by Poison Ivy, and knocks the creature into a vat of acid. It is revealed that, earlier during the night, an unseen individual had left Poison Ivy a mysterious substance that was previously manufactured at Gotham Chemical, prior to its destruction at Joker's hands. Upon further examination of the chemical, Ivy discovered unique particles that, when exposed to any type of plant life, transforms plants into truly sentient and vicious creatures. Using this to her advantage, Ivy manipulatively plants several of her upgraded plants inside powerful politicians and businessmen through apples and other foods, blackmailing them for money, power, and even environmental donations. Knowing the origin of the chemical, Ivy had her plants rebuild Gotham Chemical in an effort to produce more of the chemical and created an antidote to the condition the mayor and the others have to use as collateral to ensure that they follow through on their deals. Harley had placed the transmitter on Mayor Hill, when he was receiving some of the plant food that would temporarily keep the creature at bay, in an effort to alert Batman towards Ivy's activities and ultimately stop her from going too far in her schemes after she came to her for assistance with Gotham Chemical.

After Batman defeats Poison Ivy by electrocuting all of her plants, obtaining the cure, and saving Mayor Hill and the victims of Ivy's schemes, he heads to Funnibones Warehouse, after witnessing Joker's men hijack a blimp from the Gotham Air Strip, to collect from Harley for letting her walk the night the Joker was apparently killed. She informs him that, with Joker gone, some of his men were still operating on their own and left with some of the villain's toys and the blueprints to the historic Gotham Gasworks. Upon arriving at the Gasworks, Batman discovers Joker's men sending the villain's flammable toys into the pipe network, which lead throughout the entire city, and opens the gates to the sprinkler system to flood the complex's pipes in order to stop the toys. After disarming the last of Joker's men, Batman finds a tied up Isaac Evers, the apparent mastermind behind the Gasworks plot, who claims he only wanted to burn down Gotham Industrial in order to collect on the insurance money, as he couldn't collect on the damage left by Freeze without revealing his financial backers, particularly the Joker. With the Harlequin of Hate having funded the research with filthy lucre, Evers would be arrested for criminal facilitation and conspiracy if he revealed his affiliation with the notorious criminal and resorted to hiring the Joker's men and using his equipment in order to throw the cops off his trail after burning down his business, but the gang eventually turned on him, tied him up, and embarked on their own agenda of sending the toys throughout the city. The Dark Knight takes Evers outside for the arriving Gotham Police to take him into custody, but is forced to go undercover after being framed for injuring [[Commissioner Gordon]] with a Batarang, which led to a SWAT chase around Gotham City.

Injured and hunted by the police, Batman's investigations shift towards discovering who framed him and how everything that has occurred since the Joker's disappearance factor together. He ultimately heads back to Funnibones Warehouse, disguised, for more information, only to discover the knife that the Joker was holding the night he fell from the bridge, confirming the Joker is not dead. Batman realizes, that with the Joker's plans occurring over such a long period of time, his end goal was massive and threatens to destroy the entire city. The Harlequin of Hate finally resurfaces on the roof of the Gotham Gasworks with the stolen blimp and his gang, where he reveals that he was behind the entire crime wave that occurred after faking his death by subtly manipulating the other villains and using Isaac Evers' research, having worked with the scientist and funded all his experiments and operations through his ill-conceived fortune, to produce large quantities of the highly flammable Promethium. Weeks earlier, the Joker had arranged the fake kidnapping scheme to fake his own death in order to reside in the shadows and out of the police and Batman's scope, while he manipulated the other villains; he sent Mr. Freeze the promotional tape on Promethium to provoke him into attacking Isaac's lair so his men could convince Evers to hire their services in an insurance scam with the use of Gotham Gasworks, provided Poison Ivy with the plant enhancement chemical and used her schemes to rebuild Gotham Chemical to mass-produce his own signature [[Joker (comics)#Skills and equipment|Joker toxin]] in a quiet fashion without Batman noticing, and finally used Harley to relay false information to Batman to send him deeper into his plot at the Gasworks and ultimately frame him for attacking Commissioner Gordon.

Using Evers as a scapegoat for the Gasworks scheme, the Joker reveals that he manipulated Batman into opening up the pipes to the sprinkler system, which the Joker then plans to pump with his Joker toxin, mixed with Evers' altered drug to make it highly flammable, all over the city through a feed tube connected to the previously stolen blimp, now filled with the deadly compound, and burn the city to the ground, while its citizen choke to death on their own laughter. The villain's ultimate 'joke' is that Gotham would be completely destroyed, with the punchline being Batman had been unknowingly aiding due to the Joker's manipulation. The Clown Prince of Crime then prepares to escape in the blimp and watch Gotham from above become engulfed in flames and toxin, leaving groups of his men, armed with explosives and flamethrowers, to slow the hero down. Despite this, Batman manages to shut down the gas flow, defeat all of the Joker's thugs, and subdue Harley Quinn just in time to get on the Joker's [[blimp]] before it takes to the sky. Despite having stopped the flow of Promethium and Joker toxin into the sprinkler system, Joker plans to use the remaining compound stored in the blimp to destroy the city by setting the blimp on a collision course with the heart of Gotham, City Hall, to explosively release the compound into the air.  After a brief fight with the Joker, Batman knocks the villain out, deteriorates the gas, and disables the auto-pilot after solving a mechanism created by the Ace of Knaves to protect the auto-pilot controls. Once he realizes all his plans have failed, the Clown Prince of Crime decides to play one last, twisted joke on Batman and jumps from the blimp to entice the Dark Knight to save him and have a final showdown, while plummeting down to Gotham. The Dark Knight manages to both defeat and save the Joker and destroys the blimp, finally taking his archenemy back to [[Arkham Asylum]].

Commissioner Gordon calls Batman to apologize for the earlier SWAT chase, as they found Harley's fingerprints on the Batarang that hit him. As Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley and the Joker sit in Arkham Asylum, Batman looks out over the city as the [[Bat-Signal]] ignites on him.

==Production==
''Vengeance'' took environmental and character designs from ''The New Batman Adventures'', and starred most of the main voice cast from both it and its predecessor, ''Batman: The Animated Series''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3670">'''Berlin &amp; Beyond Film Festival''' is an annual [[film festival]] based in [[San Francisco, California]] featuring new cinema from [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].

Founded in 1996, the festival is a program of San Francisco's branch of the [[Goethe-Institut]] and has become one of the largest and most significant [[German language|German-speaking]] film festivals outside of Europe. Notable guests have included [[Mario Adorf]], [[Doris Dörrie]], [[Mara Eibl-Eibesfeldt]], [[Hannelore Elsner]], [[Anke Engelke]], [[Florian David Fitz]], [[Bruno Ganz]], [[Tom Schilling]], [[Aylin Tezel]], [[Michael Verhoeven]], and [[Wim Wenders]]. Annually, the festival welcomes over 10,000 people, and celebrates seasoned masters, up-and-coming new talents, dynamic new films, and momentous classics.

Through 2009, the festival took place each January at the [[Castro Theatre]]. In November 2009, it was announced that, starting in 2010, Berlin &amp; Beyond would be moved to the fall to coincide with ''German Currents'' - a similar festival of the Goethe-Institut in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. ''German Currents'' is a smaller festival, held at theaters in Los Angeles. The cooperation between the two festivals was prompted by the retirement of Ingrid Eggers, former festival director of Berlin &amp; Beyond, who was instrumental in its founding. The cooperation was intended to allow the sister branches of the Goethe-Institut in Los Angeles and San Francisco to bring a larger and better selection of contemporary German-language films to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and allow guest artists from Europe to make appearances at both festivals.

The festival’s current director is Sophoan Sorn, who was first appointed to lead the 15th edition, which took place in late October 2010 at the Castro Theater, along with an “Encore Day” in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. The recent 22nd edition was held at the Castro Theatre from February 9 to 11, 2018; the [[Landmark Theatres|Shattuck Cinemas]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] on February 12, 2018; and the Goethe-Institut from February 13 to 15, 2018.

The 4th Berlin &amp; Beyond Honolulu took place on April 8 to 9, 2017, in the Doris Duke Theatre at the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]].

The '''British Heavyweight Championship''' is a [[professional wrestling]] [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship]] contested for in the [[XWA (professional wrestling)|XWA]]. The championship was originally created and contested for in the [[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]] (FWA) but moved to XWA when the former company became defunct. It has also been contested for in [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) due to a working relationship between them and FWA.

The championship has been known as:
*FWA British Heavyweight Championship (1999–2007)
*XWA British Heavyweight Championship (2007 – current)

==History==

The first Champion was [[Mark Sloan (wrestler)|Mark Sloan]], who defeated Paul Glory in a tournament final on 11 July 1999.&lt;ref name="r99"/&gt; Jody Fleisch was the first person to win the belt twice after being stripped of it, while [[United States|American]] wrestler [[Christopher Daniels]] was the first non-British person to win the belt&lt;ref name="r00"/&gt; and go on to defend it on foreign soil.&lt;ref name="roh"/&gt;

Originally the belt was mostly defended under [[two out of three falls match]] rules, as was the tradition in British wrestling. This changed on 12 April 2005, when champion [[Alex Shane]] signed a cast-iron contract to make new FWA British Title rules official and permanent making all future championship matches simply one fall.

On 13 May 2006 the FWA British Heavyweight Title belt was stolen from the Morecambe Dome immediately following the FWA event at the venue during an FWA versus [[All Star Wrestling|All-Star Wrestling]] show.&lt;ref name="stolen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xwawrestling.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=40:one-phere-over-the-cuckoos-nest&amp;catid=6:features&amp;Itemid=21|title=One Phere over the Cuckoo's Nest  |date=2008-06-30|publisher=[[XWA (professional wrestling)|XWA]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to being stolen a new belt had to be created.&lt;ref name="fwa50"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fwauk.com/index.php?page=history_gm|title=The FWA's fifty golden moments|publisher=[[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]]|accessdate=2009-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916001549/http://www.fwauk.com/index.php?page=history_gm#|archive-date=2009-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the FWA was forced to retire in its interpromotional war with [[International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom]], the XWA carried the lineage of the championship simply renaming it the British Heavyweight Championship and using the same physical belt.&lt;ref name="liveson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontierwrestlingonline.co.uk/backstage_pages/backstage.htm|title=XWA – The legend lives on|work=Frontier Wrestling Alliance|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=2009-08-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531033214/http://www.frontierwrestlingonline.co.uk/backstage_pages/backstage.htm|archivedate=2007-05-31|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2009, XWA founder Greg Lambert announced the creation of a new British Heavyweight Championship that did not bear the FWA initials and gave the original belt back to [[Alex Shane]] in time for the resurrection of the FWA.&lt;ref name="shore5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xwawrestling.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=299:xwa-war-on-the-shore-v-domes-day-official-review&amp;catid=2:reviews&amp;Itemid=7|title=XWA War On The Shore V|publisher=[[XWA (professional wrestling)|XWA]]|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2018 Rhia O’Reilly became the first woman to hold the title, defeating Cara Noir in an inter-promotional show with Pro Wrestling: EVE.

'''Statius Caecilius''', also known as '''Caecilius Statius''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|s|iː|l|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|ʃ|i|ə|s}}; c. 220 BC – c. 166 BC), was a Roman comic poet.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William, and Making of America Books. New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography, Partly Based upon the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1851. Accessed via Google Play Store, March 9, 2015. Page 155.

&lt;/ref&gt;
==Life and work==
A contemporary and intimate friend of [[Ennius]], he was born in the territory of the Insubrian [[Gaul]]s, probably in [[Mediolanum]], and was probably taken as a prisoner to Rome (c. 200), during the [[Roman-Gallic wars]]. Originally a slave, he assumed the name of [[Caecilia (gens)|Caecilius]] from his patron, probably one of the [[Metelli]]. He supported himself by adapting Greek plays for the Roman stage from the [[Ancient Greek comedy#New Comedy|New Comedy]] writers, especially [[Menander]], a genre called [[Fabula palliata|Comoedia Palliata]]. If the statement in the life of [[Terence]] by [[Suetonius' minor works|Suetonius]] is correct and the reading sound, Caecilius's judgment was so esteemed that he was ordered to hear Terence's ''Andria'' (exhibited 166 BC) read and to pronounce an opinion upon it.

After several failures, Caecilius gained a high reputation. [[Volcatius Sedigitus]], the dramatic critic, places him first amongst the comic poets; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] credits him with [[pathos]] and skill in the construction of his plots; [[Horace]] (''Epistles'', ii. I. 59) contrasts his dignity with the art of Terence. [[Quintilian]] (''Inst. Orat.'', x. I. 99) speaks somewhat disparagingly of him, and [[Cicero]], although he admits with some hesitation that Caecilius may have been the chief of the comic poets (''De Optimo Genere Oratorum'', I), considers him inferior to Terence in style and Latinity (''Ad Atticum'' vii. 3), as was only natural, considering his foreign extraction.

The fact that his plays could be referred to by name alone without any indication of the author (Cicero, ''De Finibus'', ii. 7) is sufficient proof of their widespread popularity. Caecilius holds a place between [[Plautus]] and Terence in his treatment of the Greek originals; he did not, like Plautus, confound things Greek and Roman, nor, like Terence, eliminate everything that could not be romanized.

The fragments of his plays are chiefly preserved in [[Aulus Gellius]], who cites several passages from ''Plocium'' (''The Necklace'') together with the original Greek of Menander, affording the only opportunity, apart from Plautus' ''[[Bacchides (play)|Bacchides]]'', to make a substantial comparison between a Roman comedy and its Greek model.  Caecilius' version, diffuse and by no means close as a translation, does not reproduce the spirit of the original.

==Surviving titles and fragments==
Forty-two titles are known, about half based on Menander, and half on other Greek authors.  Approximately 280 fragmentary verses survive.  ''Plocium'' is the best preserved (45 verses). In addition to that, a large fragment of ''Obolostates'' was discovered not long ago among the ''papyri'' of [[Herculaneum]]; it is as yet unedited, but is estimated to contain fragments of 400-500 lines. Some preliminary information was published by the researcher, [[Knut Kleve]], in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sider. The Books of the Villa of the Papyri. In: M. Zarmakoupi, ed., The Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, 2010, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7544">'''Chest voice''' is a term used within [[vocal music]]. The use of this term varies widely within [[vocal pedagogy|vocal pedagogical]] circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regard to this term. Chest voice can be used in relation to the following:
* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] 
* A [[vocal resonation|vocal resonance]] area 
* A specific vocal [[timbre]]&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;{{cite book

==History==
The first recorded mention of the term chest voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the [[throat voice|throat]] and the [[head voice]] ([[pectoris, guttoris, capitis]]—at this time it is likely head voice referred to the [[falsetto|falsetto register]]) by the writers Johannes de Garlandia and [[Jerome of Moravia]].&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians]]''. Edited by [[Stanley Sadie]], ''Volume 6. Edmund to Fryklund''. {{ISBN|1-56159-174-2}}, Copyright Macmillan 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later redefined during the [[bel canto]] period when it was identified as the lowest of three vocal registers: the chest, [[passaggio]] and [[head voice|head registers]]. This approach is still taught by some vocal pedagogists today.&lt;ref name=Stark&gt;{{cite book

However as knowledge of human physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists have redefined or even abandoned the use of the term chest voice.&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt; In particular, the use of the term '''chest register''' has become controversial since [[vocal register|vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest and lungs. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest. The vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonation|vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the term "chest voice" over the term "chest register". These vocal pedagogists also hold that many of the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This helps to explain the controversy over this terminology. Also, the term chest register is not used within [[speech and language pathology|speech pathology]] and is not one of the four main vocal registers identified by speech pathologists. For the purposes of this article, the term "chest voice" is adopted as it is less controversial.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal voice|modal register]] or normal voice. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer’s vocal interpretive palette. The introduction of chest timbre is common to singers trained in the historic Italian school, but largely shunned among singers who have emerged from the Nordic/Germanic tradition. Such approval or disapproval is largely an aesthetic decision.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book

However, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera''. [[John Warrack]] and Ewan West, {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological process==
As the opinions on what exactly chest voice is vary greatly, there is no one consensus on the physiological production of chest voice. However there is a developing body of scientific knowledge regarding the production of various definitions of chest voice:

===Bel canto understanding===
[[File:Vocal fold scheme.svg|thumb|right|150px|Vocal fold, scheme]]
[[File:Vocal fold animated.gif|thumb|right|150px|Glottal cycle, chest voice]] 
This view understands chest voice as the vocal register used within normal speech. It was discovered via [[stroboscope]] that during ordinary [[phonation]], or speaking in a man the [[vocal folds]] contact with each other completely during each vibration closing the gap between them fully, if just for a small length of time. This closure cuts off the escaping air. When the air pressure in the trachea rises as a result of this closure, the folds are blown apart, while the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages remain in [[apposition]]. This creates an oval shaped gap between the folds and some air escapes, lowering the pressure inside the trachea. Rhythmic repetition of this movement a certain number of times a second creates a pitched note. This is how the chest voice is created.&lt;ref name="groveONE"/&gt;

===Vocal resonance understanding===
This view believes that the chest voice is a product not of [[vocal register|vocal registration]] but [[vocal resonation]]. Opinions within this understanding vary. Although some pedagogists believe the chest is an effective resonator, most agree that chest voice actually resonates in the head while creating vibratory sensations in the chest. Tarneaud says, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"during singing, the vibration of the [[vocal folds]] impresses periodic shakes on the [[larynx|laryngeal]] cartilage which transmits them to the bones in the [[thorax]] via the laryngeal depressors, and to the bony structures in the head via the laryngeal elevators. Singers feel these shakes in the form of thoracic and facial vibrations". 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These internal [[phonation|phonatory]] sensations produced by laryngeal vibrations are called "resonance" by singers and teachers of singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
|last=Tarneaud
|first= J.
|date=November 1933
|title= Study of larynx and of voice by stroboscopy 
|journal= Clinique (Paris)
|volume= 28
|pages= 337–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During singing in the lower register, the [[larynx]] is lowered since the muscles which connect it to the rib cage are tensed whereas the muscles above the larynx are not tensed. Consequently, a large proportion of the vibratory energy is transmitted to the thoracic area, giving singers the impression that their voice is resonating in the chest. This impression however is false. The chest by virtue of its design and location can make no significant contribution to the resonance system of the voice. The chest is on the wrong side of the [[vocal folds]] and there is nothing in the design of the lungs that could serve to reflect sound waves back toward the [[larynx]].&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

'''Edgar John Bergen''' (born '''Edgar John Berggren''', February 16, 1903&amp;nbsp;– September 30, 1978) was an American actor, comedian and radio performer, best known for his proficiency in [[ventriloquism]] and his characters '''Charlie McCarthy''' and '''Mortimer Snerd'''. He was also the father of actress [[Candice Bergen]].

==Early life==
[[File:Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy 1926.jpg|thumb|Bergen and Charlie when they were vaudeville performers in 1926]]
Bergen was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], one of five children and the youngest of two sons of [[Sweden|Swedish]] immigrants Nilla Svensdotter (née Osberg) and Johan Henriksson Berggren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tammy Luce |url=http://home.comcast.net/~buff.flyer2/mccarthy/Bergen_bio_new.html |title=Bergan Bio |publisher=Home.comcast.net |date=1978-09-21 |access-date=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018024043/http://home.comcast.net/~buff.flyer2/mccarthy/Bergen_bio_new.html |archivedate=2013-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived on a farm near [[Decatur, Michigan]] until he was 4 when his family returned to Sweden where he learned the language. He taught himself ventriloquism from a pamphlet called "The Wizard's Manual" when he was 11 after his family returned to Chicago.  He attended [[Lake View High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Lake View High School]]. After his father died when he was just 16, he went out to work as an apprentice accountant, a furnace stoke, a player piano operator, and a projectionist in a silent-movie house. The famous ventriloquist Harry Lester was so impressed by Edgar that he gave the teenager almost daily lessons for three months in the fundamentals of ventriloquism. In the fall of 1919, Edgar paid Chicago woodcarver Theodore Mack $36 to sculpt a likeness of a rascally red-headed [[Ireland|Irish]] newspaperboy he knew. The head went on a [[Ventriloquism|dummy]] named Charlie McCarthy, which became Bergen's lifelong [[sidekick]]. He had created the body himself, using a nine-inch length of broomstick for the backbone, and rubber bands and cords to control the lower jaw mechanism of the mouth.

For college he attended [[Northwestern University]] where he was enrolled in the pre-med program to please his mother. He switched to Speech &amp; Drama but never completed his degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/alumni/bergen.html |title=Edgar Bergen: Alumni Exhibit: Northwestern University Archives |publisher=Exhibits.library.northwestern.edu |date= |access-date=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his first public performance at Waveland Avenue Congregational Church located on the northeast corner of Waveland and Janssen. He lived across the street from the church. In 1965, he gave the church a generous contribution, a thoughtful letter, and a photograph of himself which had been requested by the minister and was displayed in the church's assembly room which was dedicated to Bergen. He cut out an "R" and a "G" from his family name and went from Berggren to Bergen on the showbills. Between June 1922 and August 1925, he performed every summer on the professional Chautauqua circuit and at the Lyceum theater in Chicago. Bergen had an interest in aviation, becoming a private pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=AOPA Pilot|date=May 2014|page=79|title=A Plane-Crazy America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Chase and Sanborn Hour''==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Chase and Sanborn Hour.jpg|thumb|Edgar Bergen and his dummy Charlie McCarthy with W.C. Fields on The Chase and Sanborn Hour]]
His first performances were in [[vaudeville]], at which point he legally changed his last name to the easier-to-pronounce "Bergen". He worked in one-reel [[short subject|movie shorts]], but his real success was on the radio. He and Charlie were seen at a New York party by [[Elsa Maxwell]] for [[Noël Coward]], who recommended them for an engagement at the famous [[Rainbow Room]]. It was there that two producers saw Bergen and Charlie perform. They then recommended them for a guest appearance on [[Rudy Vallée]]'s program.

Their initial appearance (December 17, 1936) was so successful that the following year they were given regular cast rolls as part of ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]]''. Under various sponsors (and two different networks), they were on the air from May 9, 1937 to July 1, 1956. The popularity of a ventriloquist on radio, when one could see neither the dummies nor his skill, surprised and puzzled many critics, then and now. Even knowing that Bergen provided the voice, listeners perceived Charlie as a genuine person, but only through artwork rather than photos could the character be seen as truly lifelike. Thus, in 1947, Sam Berman caricatured Bergen and McCarthy for the network's glossy promotional book, ''NBC Parade of Stars: As Heard Over Your Favorite NBC Station''.

Bergen's skill as an entertainer, especially his characterization of Charlie, carried the show (many of which have survived).{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Bergen's success on radio was paralleled in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Peter Brough]] and his dummy [[Archie Andrews (puppet)|Archie Andrews]] (''[[Educating Archie]]'').

For the radio program, Bergen developed other characters, notably the slow-witted Mortimer Snerd and the man-hungry Effie Klinker. The star remained Charlie, who was always presented as a highly precocious child (albeit in [[top hat]], cape, and [[monocle]])—a debonair, girl-crazy, child-about-town. As a child, and a wooden one at that, Charlie could get away with [[double entendres]] which were otherwise impossible under broadcast standards of the time.

:'''Charlie:''' "May I have a kiss good-bye?"
:'''[[Dale Evans]]:''' "Well, I can't see any harm in that!"
:'''Charlie:''' "Oh. I wish you could. A harmless kiss doesn't sound very thrilling."

Charlie and [[Mae West]] had this conversation on December 12, 1937.
:'''Charlie:''' "Not so loud, Mae, not so loud! All my girlfriends are listening."
:'''Mae:''' "Oh, yeah! You’re all wood and a yard long."
:'''Charlie:''' "Yeah."
:'''Mae:''' "You weren’t so nervous and backward when you came up to see me at my apartment. In fact, you didn’t need any encouragement to kiss me."
:'''Charlie:''' "Did I do that?"
:'''Mae:''' "Why, you certainly did. I got marks to prove it. An' splinters, too."

Charlie's feud with [[W. C. Fields]] was a regular feature of the show.
:'''W. C. Fields:''' "Well, if it isn't Charlie McCarthy, the woodpecker's pinup boy!"

:'''Charlie:''' "Well, if it isn't W.C. Fields, the man who keeps Seagram's in business!"

:'''W. C. Fields:''' "I love children. I can remember when, with my own little unsteady legs, I toddled from room to room."
:'''Charlie:''' "When was that? Last night?"

:'''W. C. Fields:''' "Quiet, Wormwood, or I'll whittle you into a venetian blind."
:'''Charlie:''' "Ooh, that makes me shutter!"

:'''W. C. Fields:''' "Tell me, Charles, is it true that your father was a [[Gateleg table|gate-leg table]]?"
:'''Charlie: '''"If it is, your father was under it."

:'''W. C. Fields:''' "Why, you stunted spruce, I'll throw a Japanese beetle on you."
:'''Charlie:''' "Why, you bar-fly you, I'll stick a wick in your mouth, and use you for an alcohol lamp!"

:'''Charlie:''' "Pink elephants take aspirin to get rid of W. C. Fields."

:'''W.C. Fields:''' "Step out of the sun Charles. You may come unglued."
:'''Charlie:''' "Mind if I stand in the shade of your nose?"
[[File:Edgar Bergen Charlie McCarthy 1947.JPG|thumb|150px|Bergen and Charlie with an NBC-produced comic book ''On the Air'', 1947.]]
Bergen was not the most technically skilled ventriloquist—Charlie McCarthy frequently twitted him for moving his lips—but Bergen's sense of comedic timing was superb, and he handled Charlie's snappy dialog with aplomb. Bergen's wit in creating McCarthy's striking personality and that of his other characters was the making of the show. Bergen's popularity as a ventriloquist on radio, where the trick of "throwing his voice" was not visible, suggests his appeal was primarily the personality he applied to his characters.

Bergen and McCarthy are sometimes credited with "saving the world" because, on the night of October 30, 1938, when [[Orson Welles]] performed his ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|War of the Worlds]]'' radio play that panicked many listeners, most of the American public had instead tuned to Bergen and McCarthy on another station and never heard Welles' play. Conversely, it has also been theorized that Bergen inadvertently contributed to the hysteria. When the musical portion of Bergen's show, ''The Chase and Sanborn Hour'', aired approximately 12 minutes into the show, many listeners adjusted their dial and found the ''War of the Worlds'' presentation already underway with a realistic-sounding reporter detailing terrible events.

[[Ray Noble (musician)|Ray Noble]] was the musical director and composer, and teenage singer Anita Gordon provided the songs on his show. Gordon was said to have been discovered by Charlie, who had a crush on her.

In the fall (autumn) of 1948, Edgar and Charlie faced serious competition from [[ABC Radio Network|ABC's]] "jackpot" quiz show, ''[[Stop the Music (American TV series)|Stop the Music]]'', which suddenly drew more listeners ([[Fred Allen]] faced a similar problem because he directly appeared before them). In December 1948, Edgar announced he was temporarily "retiring" from radio, admitting that ''Stop the Music'' was too popular to compete with. His final NBC broadcast was on December 26, 1948.

==''The Charlie McCarthy Show''==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
In October 1949, Bergen went to [[CBS Radio Network|CBS]], with a new weekly program, ''The Charlie McCarthy Show'', sponsored by [[Coca-Cola]]. After their sponsorship ended in June 1952, [[Richard Hudnut]], on behalf of "Lanolin Plus" cosmetics, primarily sustained the series until the end of the 1953–54 season. In October 1954, [[Kraft Foods]] sponsored a new ''Edgar Bergen Hour''. After Kraft's departure, the series continued with participating sponsors as a 55-minute series in the fall of 1955. However, because more people were watching television on Sunday nights than listened to radio (and advertisers preferred to sponsor TV shows by then), the series finally ended on July 1, 1956.

==Comic strip==
In addition to his work as a ventriloquist, Bergen was also an actor and comic strip creator. He established the syndicated comic strip ''Mortimer &amp; Charlie'', which ran in newspapers from July 1939 to May 1940, illustrated first by [[Ben Batsford]] and then by [[Carl Buettner]]. The comic strip's writer was uncredited, but some of the gags certainly were lifted from the hit radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2008/03/obscurity-of-day-mortimer-and-charlie.html|title=Obscurity of the Day: Mortimer and Charlie. Holtz, Allan.

==Films==
[[File:Edgar Bergen &amp; Mortimer Snerd in Stage Door Canteen.jpg|left|thumb|200px|In the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943) with Mortimer Snerd]]
Bergen and his alter ego Charlie McCarthy were given top billing in several films, including the [[Technicolor]] extravaganza ''[[The Goldwyn Follies]]'' (1938), opposite the [[Ritz Brothers]]. That year they also appeared in ''[[You Can't Cheat an Honest Man]]'' with [[W. C. Fields]]. At the height of their popularity in 1937, Bergen was presented an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Oscar]] (in the form of a wooden Oscar statuette,the only wooden Oscar given so far) for his creation of Charlie McCarthy.  Bergen, along with Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd were also featured in the 1938 film ''[[Letter of Introduction (film)|Letter of Introduction]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

As an actor alone, Bergen portrayed the timid suitor of the sister Trina in ''[[I Remember Mama (film)|I Remember Mama]]'' (1948), and appeared in ''[[Captain China]]'' (1949), ''[[The Hanged Man (1964 film)|The Hanged Man]]'' (1964) and ''[[Don't Make Waves]]'' (1967). Other film roles for the team include ''[[Look Who's Laughing]]'' (1941) and ''[[Here We Go Again (film)|Here We Go Again]]'' (1942), both with [[Fibber McGee and Molly]]. Charlie McCarthy wore a US Army uniform in ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943) with Mortimer Snerd. Bergen and McCarthy were also featured in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'' (1947). He later cameoed in all-star films such as ''[[The Phynx]]'' (1970), ''[[Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood]]'' (1976), and ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979). In 1977, Bergen  had made a guest appearance  on a second-season episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', the highly acclaimed television comedy/variety program  produced by [[Jim Henson]] who considered Bergen a major inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=078644259X|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Candice had also guest-starred on the show during its first season. Bergen died shortly after filming his ''Muppet Movie'' scene, which was also his final public appearance,  and was subsequently dedicated to him. In 2009 Bergen was featured in the comedy documentary ''I'm No Dummy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165 "Hollywood's Corporate Delusion"], ''Digital Cinema Report'' @ imdb.com; accessed July 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Bryan W.

Seated, from left, [[Carolyn Jones]] and [[Dick Powell]].]]
Although his regular series never made the transition to [[television]], Bergen made numerous appearances on the medium during his career.  His first appearance was with Charlie McCarthy on [[NBC]]'s pioneering television variety show [[Hour Glass]] in November 1946.   In a filmed [[Thanksgiving]] special, billed as his official TV debut, sponsored by [[Coca-Cola]] on [[CBS]] in 1950, the new character Podine Puffington was introduced; this saucy Southern belle was as tall as a real woman, in contrast to Bergen's other sit-on-the-knee sized characters. On Christmas Day that same year, Bergen and McCarthy appeared as guests on Walt Disney's first television show, ''[[One Hour in Wonderland]]''.

In 1954, Bergen was a co-host on a memorable TV musical special, ''[[General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein]]''.

On December 26, 1954, Bergen appeared on [[What's My Line]] as a mystery guest. Bergen also hosted the television game show ''[[Who Do You Trust?|Do You Trust Your Wife?]]'' in 1956–1957, later succeeded, in a daytime edition, by [[Johnny Carson]].

He appeared in the [[Christmas]] 1957 episode of [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s ''[[The Gisele MacKenzie Show]]''. In 1958 Bergen appeared with his 12-year-old daughter [[Candice Bergen|Candice]] on an episode of ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' starring [[Groucho Marx]]. In 1959, he appeared in the second episode titled "Dossier" of the NBC [[espionage]] [[television series|series]] ''[[Five Fingers (TV series)|Five Fingers]]'' starring [[David Hedison]]. On May 21, 1959, he guest-starred with Charlie McCarthy on NBC's ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]''. Bergen continued to appear regularly on television during the 1960s and into the 1970s, appearing on [[The Tonight Show]] as late as 1977. He guest-starred as Charlie in the 1960 episode "Moment of Fear" of [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]''. He did a stint as one of the ''What's My Line?'' mystery guests on the popular Sunday night CBS series. His colleague [[Paul Winchell]] happened to be a panel member during that episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU98KwL_pQ8&amp;feature=related |title=Edgar Bergen-What's My Line|publisher=YouTube|date=2008-09-13|access-date=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergen appeared on the NBC interview program ''[[Here's Hollywood]]''.

Bergen appeared as Grandpa Zeb Walton in the original [[The Waltons|Waltons]] television movie, ''The Homecoming: A Christmas Story'' (1971). The role was played by [[Will Geer]] in the subsequent TV series. During the run of ''The Waltons'' — which took place throughout  the 1930s and 1940s—the voices of Bergen and Charlie McCarthy were sporadically heard from the Waltons' radio, as family members regularly tuned in for that program.

==Family==

In 1941, Bergen met 19-year-old [[Frances Bergen|Frances Westerman]], who had graduated from Los Angeles High School the year before, in the audience of Bergen's radio program as the guest of a member of his staff. Sitting in the front row, the young fashion model's legs caught 38-year-old Bergen's attention and he asked to meet her. The two were married in Mexico after years of long-distance courtship, on June 28, 1945. On May 9, 1946 Frances gave birth to future actress [[Candice Bergen]], whose first performances were on Bergen's radio show. Their second child was film and television editor Kris Bergen. Frances also acted, appearing in several movies, co-starring in the 1958 television series ''[[Yancy Derringer]]'', and guest-starring in numerous other shows.

==Death==
In mid-September 1978 he announced that he was retiring after over 50 years in show business and sending his monocled, top-hatted partner, Charlie McCarthy, to the [[National Museum of American History]] at the  [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].  He opened at [[Caesar's Palace Hotel]] Las Vegas on September 27, for a two-week "Farewell to show business" engagement. He died three days later on September 30, 1978.

Bergen was interred with his parents (who are buried under their true surname of "Berggren"), in [[Inglewood Park Cemetery]], [[Inglewood, California]]. Edgar Bergen's wife of 33 years, Frances Westerman Bergen, died at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], on October 2, 2006, aged 84, from undisclosed causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/northern_california/15671633.htm|title=San Jose Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic|work=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also buried in Inglewood Cemetery. In 1990, Bergen was elected to the [[Radio Hall of Fame]], the same year that ''The Charlie McCarthy Show'' was selected as an honored program. A message in the [[closing credits]] dedicates ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (which featured Edgar and Charlie in their last screen appearance) to the memory and magic of Edgar. In 1991, the United States Postal Service honored him with a 29-cent commemorative stamp.

==Hollywood Walk of Fame==
Bergen was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with three stars in 1960, for his contributions to television, [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures]], and radio. The stars are located at 6425, 6766, and 6801 [[Hollywood Boulevard]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/edgar-bergen |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame - Edgar Bergen |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |access-date=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Elemental Rage''''' is a [[2011 in video gaming|2011]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[platform game]] developed by [[Argentina|Argentinian]] indie studio Oniric Games. It is similar to the ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'' series.

==Plot==

A boy named Huma awakens inside a vast castle, and must find the missing elemental spirits inside its depths to restore the world's corrupted denizens back to their normal selves.

==Gameplay==

The player controls Huna as he explores the [[side-scrolling]] castle labyrinth, using the virtual controls on the touchpad. At the beginning of the game, Huna can run, jump, and bash enemies with his staff, but as he discovers the elemental spirits hidden throughout the castle, he will gain more abilities, e.g., double-jumping. After acquiring such techniques, the player will have to backtrack to previous areas to access new routes leading deeper into the castle. Enemies will sometimes drop weapon upgrades, but these are temporary, and the weapon will downgrade back to normal when the player takes damage.

==Reception==

''Elemental Rage'' received mixed reviews, currently sitting at 69/100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/elemental-rage | title = Elemental Rage | accessdate = September 20, 2016 | publisher = [[Metacritic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TouchArcade]] gave it 4 stars out of 5, calling it "one of the best experiences you can have if you enjoy a good action-platforming game", though criticizing its short length and excessive hand-holding of the player.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://toucharcade.com/2011/04/22/elemental-rage-review/ | title = 'Elemental Rage' Review - A Great Metroidvania-Style Platformer for iOS | first = Jared | last = Nelson | date = April 22, 2011 | accessdate = May 12, 2016 | publisher = [[MacRumors#Sister sites|Touch Arcade]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Slide to Play'' scored the game 7.5/10 and said it was a "well polished adventure game that has taken inspiration from the metroidvania genre", specifically praising the "impressive soundtrack, something we don’t often see in iDevice games" written by Argentinian Composer Christian Fernando Perucchi, but expressed reservations about the game's technical performance and its frustrating combat system, writing, "[i]t takes too long to upgrade the weapon [after being downgraded], and it is far too easy to lose it again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slidetoplay.com/elemental-rage-review/ | title = Elemental Rage | date = April 28, 2011 | accessdate = September 20, 2016 | publisher = Slide to Play }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'' awarded the game 7/10, remarking that "Combat, platforming, and exploration meld to form a diverse style of gameplay not unique to ''Elemental Rage'', but undeniably enjoyable"; however, it criticized numerous aspects of the game, saying "the characters are annoying cliches", "[t]here are too many blind falls that lead to death", "what few [boss battles] there are unpolished", and "[f]ighting enemies is frequently awkward due to the prevalence of flying creatures and rigid controls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Multiformat/Elemental+Rage/review.asp?c=29389 | title = Elemental Rage | first = Tracy | last = Erickson | date = April 26, 2011 | accessdate = September 20, 2016 | publisher = [[Pocket Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' gave ''Elemental Rage'' a score of 2.5/5, and wrote, "aside from a boring narrative and some excessive backtracking, the cute art aesthetic and challenging platforming make this a satisfactory experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/219473/ios-game-of-the-day-elemental-rage/ | title = Elemental Rage | date = May 18, 2011 | accessdate = September 20, 2016 | publisher = [[GamePro]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extant literature''' and '''extant music''' refers to texts or music that has survived from the past to the present time, as opposed to [[lost work]]. Extant literature can be divided into extant original [[manuscript]]s, copies of original manuscripts, quotations and paraphrases of passages of non-extant texts contained in other works, translations of non-extant texts into other languages, or, more recently, photocopies or digital copies of texts.

'''''Fab Five: The Texas Cheerleader Scandal''''' is a 2008 American [[teen drama]] [[TV movie|made-for-television]] film produced by [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]]. It stars [[Jenna Dewan]], [[Ashley Benson]], and [[Tatum O'Neal]], and was directed by [[Tom McLoughlin]].  The film premiered on August 2, 2008. It is based on real-life events that occurred at [[McKinney North High School]] in [[McKinney, Texas]], in 2006, five teenage [[cheerleader]]s became notorious for truancies, violations of the school dress code, and general disrespect to the school community.&lt;ref name=hollyrep/&gt;

==Background==

In 2005, Michaela Ward was hired to teach geography and coach the cheerleading squad at [[McKinney North High School]].&lt;ref name=revisited/&gt; She discovered that five cheerleaders, nicknamed the "Fab Five", had been disruptive in school and off-campus. They are the five high school mean girls who rules this school with an iron fist. They broke rules, were truant, and causing disturbances during classes. They also caused trouble during off-campus activities, posting photographs of themselves partying, drinking alcohol, and visiting an adult store on [[Myspace]].&lt;ref name="mean girls"/&gt; Ward was unable to deal with the Fab Five and the school administrators who did not punish them; she resigned in October 2006,&lt;ref name="mean girls"/&gt; despite her close relationships with her students.&lt;ref name="interview ward"/&gt; Ward contacted media to tell them about the Fab Five's unruly behavior and the school's handling of them.&lt;ref name="mean girls"/&gt; Ward told [[Lifetime Television]] about the story; the company produced a film based on Ward's story.&lt;ref name=revisited/&gt;

==Plot==
Five high school cheerleaders dubbed the "Fab Five"—Brooke Tippit ([[Ashley Benson]]) who is co-captain of the squad, Jeri Blackburn ([[Jessica Heap]]), Lisa Toledo (Aimee Spring Fortier), Ashley ([[Stephanie Honoré]]), and Tabitha Doering (Ashlynn Ross) run amok and who are the mean girls of the school. Teachers, parents, and administrators fail to punish them for their unruly behavior, which includes repeatedly getting their coaches fired after disagreements or driving them to quit. These girls disregard school rules, drink alcohol, bully other students, and post suggestive pictures on the internet. After a new cheerleading coach Emma Carr ([[Jenna Dewan]]) arrives, the girls initially rebel against her but later become cooperative. Brooke becomes furious with Coach Carr when she assigns Meagan Harper, the most respected member of the squad, as co-captain because up until then, she had been the only captain. The Fab Five perform well at a pep rally, but after Ashley is kissed by Jeri’s boyfriend, the other girls eject her from the group and later become the "Fab Four," although Ashley remains part of the squad. Carr tries to discipline the girls, which results in a change in attitude. The girls start bullying other pupils, including Cindy, Meagan's younger sister, and are suspended from the team. The Fab Four get drunk and are caught trying to leave the campus by a guard and the principal. 

The girls tell the school's superintendent they were tired after a test and wanted to sleep. The security guard then tells Carr about the incident, and she confronts the principal and superintendent, who give excuses for not punishing the girls. Carr insists the principal punishes them, so the principal threatens to dissolve the team. Defiant, Carr punishes the whole squad by continually canceling practices and kicking Jeri off the squad. At next practice session, Carr hands each of the girls an eraser for a "fresh" start, but only Tabitha accepts. As revenge for Jeri's ejection, the girls show the superintendent a picture of Carr hugging another teacher at the school and say the two have been having an affair. At the discipline meeting for Jeri, Carr is repeatedly accused of flirting and not formally punishing the girls.

At the next practice session, the "Fab Four" struggle to perform the [[liberty stunt]], but Carr inspires them to learn it. Carr finds Lisa has cheated on a test. After penalizing her, Lisa yells at Carr and storms out. Lisa then tells her father that Carr was bullying her. Carr then accidentally resigns and sends an email to the cheerleaders apologizing for it. She visits the school and is fired by the principal. The girls confront Carr as she prepares to leave the school. She hears about a reporter who is researching "cheerleaders gone wild" and gives an interview about the ongoing events at Jackson High School. The school investigates, and the "Fab Four" enjoy the attention and lie to the reporter about their treatment. Carr discovers the reporter's true agenda, tells him what happened, leaves angrily, and bumps into Brooke. Carr simply asks her if she thinks the [[University of Southern California]] will accept her as a student after all the negative publicity of what has happened.

The investigator reports that the allegations against the "Fab Four" and administrators are true and that Carr is innocent. He blames the principal for the problem and Carr losing her job. Lorraine and the assistant principal are suspended from their jobs. Brooke is pulled from the school by her mother, and the rest of the "Fab Four" are no longer allowed to cheer. Brooke and her mother leave followed by cameras, Brooke waves, and Carr is despondent. However, Carr doesn't get her job back from the school. Four months later, Carr watches the girls at a cheer competition and is welcomed with praise and hugs, including Ashley, who she exchanges smiles with. The new cheerleaders compete, and Carr discovers Cindy had written an essay about her, discussing how she stood up to the administration and stopped Brooke and the Fab Three from terrorizing their school, revealing that Carr did change things after all. The girls compete and perform the stunt they struggled with earlier, leaving Carr feeling proud and worthy.

==Reception==
The television movie aired on Saturday, August 2, 2008, and scored a 2.63 [[Nielsen ratings|household rating]] (3,041,547 viewers). It scored a 2.63 rating (280,405 viewers) among females aged 12&amp;ndash;17 and a 2.17 rating (1,219,726 viewers) among females aged 18&amp;ndash;49.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-04-2008/0004861259&amp;EDATE= |title=Lifetime Original Movie 'Fab Five: The Texas Cheerleader Scandal' Builds Pyramid to Become Network's Top W18-34 and W12-17 Movie of the Year |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713222923/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104 |archivedate=2012-07-13 |df= }} Also seen in [http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2008/08/04/lifetime-original-movie-fab-five-the-texas-cheerleader-scandal-builds-pyramid-to-become-networks-top-w18-34-and-w12-17-movie-of-the-year-28391/20080804lifetime01/ The Futon Critic] and [https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/04/idUS170026+04-Aug-2008+PRN20080804 Reuters].&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Stasi of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave the movie three stars out of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=October 21, 2012|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/item_A3LG9IW6ErfWmNQyA5vcQN|title=Mean Girls High: True Story of 'Texas Cheerleaders'|author=Linda Stasi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' said the real-life events that inspired the film were "grimmer" than the television movie; the real-life principal and the vice-principal of the school lost their jobs. Girls from the [[Myspace]] photographs (the "Fab Five") became victims of stalkers and "haunted by their reputations [from high school]". Discipline at [[McKinney North High School]] became stricter than before.&lt;ref name=revisited/&gt; ''Newsweek'' said the film  was close to the real-life events, the portrayal of Jenna Dewan's character was "brave but naïve", and the story was "an entertaining morality tale" yet "preachy".&lt;ref name=revisited/&gt;

Steve Thompson of ''[[Yahoo!]] Voices'' praised this movie for addressing important messages to viewers about consequential actions, especially by schools and cheerleaders. Thompson called the portrayal of cheerleaders "purely evil" and vindictive, and that some scenes were inspired by other real "mean girls" events, such as the beating of a 16-year-old girl in [[Lakeland, Florida]], rather than the McKinney incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/review-fab-five-texas-cheerleader-scandal-on-1759855.html?cat=40 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210053314/http://voices.yahoo.com/review-fab-five-texas-cheerleader-scandal-on-1759855.html?cat=40 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 10, 2013 |title=Review of ''Fab Five: The Texas Cheerleader Scandal'' on Lifetime |author=Steve Thompson |work=[[Yahoo!]] Voices |date=August 2, 2008 |accessdate=October 21, 2012 }} For more information about beatings of a 16-year-old girl from [[Lakeland, Florida]], read [http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/24009077 the article from MSNBC.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the story broke, Michaela Ward faced unemployment and "became ostracized", especially after her lawsuits. In 2008 she filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to get her job back.

'''''Fallout 76''''' is an online [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Bethesda Game Studios]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]], part of the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series. Released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on November 14, 2018, it is a [[prequel]] to previous series games.{{efn|The opening chapter of ''[[Fallout 4]]'' takes place twenty-five years prior to ''Fallout 76'', but the remainder of the game takes place two hundred years later.}} ''Fallout 76'' is Bethesda Game Studios's first [[multiplayer]] game; players explore the [[open world]], which has been torn apart by nuclear war, with others.

Bethesda developed the game using a modified version of its [[Creation Engine]], which allowed the accommodation of multiplayer gameplay and a more detailed game world. ''Fallout 76'' was released to generally mixed reviews&lt;!-- Please don't add "mixed-to-negative" as it's imprecisely describe the game's reception, "Mixed" describes both the game's mixed and negative reception, as per [[WP:VG/MIXED]] --&gt;, with many criticizing the game's numerous technical issues, overall design, lack of gameplay purpose, and absence of human [[non-playable character]]s.

''Fallout 76'' is [[Bethesda Game Studios]]' first [[online multiplayer]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=YouTube Live at E3 2018 Monday: Ninja, PlayStation &amp; Ubisoft Press Conferences (Official Livestream) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPWDwBrUNyY |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180610233436/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPWDwBrUNyY# |archive-date=June 10, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/10/17405448/fallout-76-multiplayer-trailer-bethesda-e3-2018 |title=Bethesda confirms 'Fallout 76 is entirely online' |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611172738/https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/10/17405448/fallout-76-multiplayer-trailer-bethesda-e3-2018# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In 2006, [[Interplay Entertainment]] and [[Masthead Studios]] started development of ''[[Fallout Online]]'', a [[massively multiplayer online game]] set in the ''Fallout'' world.

These private servers allow players to invite friends to play in order to prevent undesirable aspects of [[player versus player]] gameplay such as [[Griefer|griefing]] from affecting an individual player's experience of the game. Howard described the delay as being necessary to allow Bethesda time to assure the stability of public servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-private-servers |title=Fallout 76 will have private servers |first=Harry |last=Sheppard |date=June 12, 2018 |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |work=[[PCGamesN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612163019/https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-private-servers# |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of previous ''Fallout'' games are present and are modified to work with the real-time game. The [[Fallout 3#V.A.T.S.|V.A.T.S.]] system—a mechanic first introduced in ''[[Fallout 3]]'' that allows players to pause the game to target specific locations on an enemy's body to attack—is used in ''Fallout 76'' as a real-time system, though it still allow players to specify targets on an enemy's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-vats |title=Fallout 76 has a real-time VATS system |first=Jeremy |last=Peel |date=June 12, 2018 |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |work=[[PCGamesN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612134308/https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-vats# |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game includes revisions to the [[Fallout (video game)#SPECIAL system|SPECIAL progression system]]. Character attributes fall into one of seven categories: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck. As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerful—albeit more expensive—perks. The system is designed to encourage the player to recognise the situation they are in and choose perks that aid them rather than passively selecting them and having them for the duration of the game.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

''Fallout 76'' does not feature any human non-player characters (NPCs) as all surviving humans are other players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1006003558502752256 |title=Bethesda Game Studios on Twitter |website=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611124134/https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1006003558502752256# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This required Bethesda to change their approach to storytelling as previous games in the series relied on NPCs to assign quests, engage the player in dialog and advance the overall narrative. ''Fallout 76'' instead uses a combination of NPCs in the form of robots, recordings such as collectible holotapes, terminals throughout the game world, and environmental storytelling where the player uncovers fragments of a narrative by exploring locations that they piece together themselves.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Each of these elements had previously been used in the series, often to provide backstory for characters and the world of the game whilst remaining separate from the main narrative. According to Howard, this system allows Bethesda to tell a story whilst giving players a greater ability to create their own narratives.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The game expands on ''Fallout 4''{{'}}s settlements by allowing the player the ability to build bases at many locations of the map.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-is-a-multiplayer-softcore-survival-game-about-building-settlements/ |title=Fallout 76 is an online game, and you can nuke other players |work=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611173815/https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-is-a-multiplayer-softcore-survival-game-about-building-settlements/ |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These creations are assigned to the player's profile and are removed from the game world when the player is offline to prevent progress from being lost.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} While other players are able to attack player settlements while they are online, the game preserves player creations in some form to prevent players from having to start over if their creations and progress are destroyed.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Players are able to use nuclear weapons to temporarily change the areas of game world. After acquiring launch codes, the player can access missile silos and fire a missile at almost any point on the map. This irradiates the area, which the player can explore to find rare weapons, gear and items. However, it also attracts powerful enemies and the player needs to be sufficiently strong to survive.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer" /&gt; The game also includes a photo mode. The player has the ability to pose their character and choose from a variety of facial expressions and filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fallout 76 will have a photo mode, complete with poses and fancy filters |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-will-have-a-photo-mode-complete-with-poses-and-fancy-filters/ |website=pcgamer |accessdate=October 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918160725/https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-will-have-a-photo-mode-complete-with-poses-and-fancy-filters/ |archive-date=September 18, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
{{further|Fallout (series)#Setting}}
''Fallout 76'' is a narrative prequel to previous ''Fallout'' games. It is set in an [[alternate history]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/major-events-in-the-fallout-timeline/ | title = Major events in the Fallout timeline | first = Jody | last = Macgregor | date = July 28, 2018 | accessdate = August 14, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180815055253/https://www.pcgamer.com/major-events-in-the-fallout-timeline/ | archive-date = August 15, 2018 | dead-url = no | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and takes place in 2102, twenty-five years after a nuclear war that devastated the Earth. The player character is a resident of Vault 76, a [[fallout shelter]] that was built in [[West Virginia]] to house America's best and brightest minds. The player character exits the Vault on "Reclamation Day" as part of a plan to re-colonize the Wasteland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76 |title=Fallout 76: The History Of Vault 76 And What It Means For Fallout 76 |first=Tom |last=Marks |date=May 31, 2018 |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611165612/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Fallout 76'' uses a modified version of Bethesda's [[Creation Engine]] designed to accommodate multiplayer gameplay.&lt;ref name="Noclip"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Danny O'Dwyer|Noclip]] |title=The Making of Fallout 76 – Noclip Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=June 17, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617050330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs# |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on modifying the engine was carried out by [[Bethesda Game Studios Austin]].&lt;ref name="Noclip" /&gt; The modified engine also allowed the development team to incorporate new lighting models, rendering processes and more accurate terrain mapping. These allowed the development team to create a world with sixteen times more detail than was possible with previous iterations of the Creation Engine. The game also includes a dynamic weather system that allows for localized climatic conditions and greater [[draw distance]]s mean that these weather events can be observed by the player from far away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Bethesda Softworks |title=Bethesda Game Studios E3 2018 Showcase |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPlpOIfFbWI |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=June 17, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614214600/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPlpOIfFbWI# |archive-date=June 14, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many previous games in the series, its musical score was composed by [[Inon Zur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fogel |first1=Stefanie |title='Fallout,' 'Dragon Age' Series Composer Inon Zur to Score 'Fallout 76' |url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/fallout-76-inon-zur-exclusive-1202900549/ |website=Variety |accessdate=August 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820105823/https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/fallout-76-inon-zur-exclusive-1202900549/ |archive-date=August 20, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This stream was watched by a total of over two million people, with more than one hundred thousand people watching at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17408600/bethesda-fallout-76-twitch-stream |title=Two million people tuned into Bethesda's day-long stream of a toy |work=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180603154806/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17408600/bethesda-fallout-76-twitch-stream# |archive-date=June 3, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of the game were announced by Howard during Bethesda's press conference at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018|Electronic Entertainment Expo]] on June 10, 2018, including its anticipated release date of November 14, 2018. As it is Bethesda Game Studio's first experience with a fully online game, Howard confirmed that there would be an [[Beta test|open beta phase]], beginning on October 23, 2018 for Xbox One, and October 30, 2018 for PlayStation 4 and PC.&lt;ref name="The Verge" /&gt;

===Pre-release===
In response to the announcement that ''Fallout 76'' would feature only multiplayer, a petition was created by fans of the series which called for the game to include a single-player mode. The petition received thousands of signatures within a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/06/11/fallout-76-petition-single-player/ |title=Fallout 76 Petition Demands a Single-Player Only Mode |work=WWG |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612202713/http://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/06/11/fallout-76-petition-single-player/ |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/45859-fallout-76-single-player-petition-has-over-6k-signatures |title='Fallout 76' Single Player Petition: Thousands of Fans Demand Solo Campaign |work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613084700/https://www.inverse.com/article/45859-fallout-76-single-player-petition-has-over-6k-signatures# |archive-date=June 13, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the game's announcement, there was a burst of interest in tourism in West Virginia. The website "West Virginia Explorer" reported an increase of fifteen times the visitors to the site in the days after the announcement, while management of the [[Camden Park (amusement park)|Camden Park]] amusement park said there was an increase in people looking to purchase park merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-west-virginia |title=West Virginia tourist sites see massive traffic after Fallout 76 reveal |first=Dustin |last=Bailey |date=June 18, 2018 |accessdate=June 18, 2018 |work=[[PCGamesN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618230343/https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-west-virginia# |archive-date=June 18, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
According to review aggregator [[Metacritic]], the PC and PlayStation 4 versions received "mixed or average" reviews, while the Xbox One version received "generally unfavorable" reviews.&lt;ref name="Fallout 76-MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fallout 76-MCXONE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fallout 76-MCPS4"/&gt; The numerous negative reviews from critics led ''Forbes'' to describe the release of ''Fallout 76'' as a "historically bad launch" and to question if Bethesda would consider the property "worth saving" moving forward.&lt;ref name="Forbes-2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/11/23/after-a-historically-bad-launch-is-fallout-76-worth-saving/ |title=After A Historically Bad Launch, Is 'Fallout 76' Worth Saving? |last=Tassi| first=Paul|date=November 23, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=November 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123201440/https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/11/23/after-a-historically-bad-launch-is-fallout-76-worth-saving/ |archive-date=November 23, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' called the game "a pointless walk in the post-apocalypse" featuring "half-baked conflict and witless quests to unearth the dead".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/19/fallout-76-review-playstation-xbox-pc |title=Fallout 76 review – a pointless walk in the post-apocalypse |last=Nielsen |first=Holly |date=November 19, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=November 19, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119163219/https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/19/fallout-76-review-playstation-xbox-pc# |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Forbes]]'', ''Fallout 76'' was a "huge, rare, total miss" by Bethesda.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2018/11/20/fallout-76-review-xbox-one-x-look-upon-my-works-and-despair/#3514c2af5e67 |title='Fallout 76' Review (Xbox One X): Look Upon My Works And Despair |last=Tassi |first=Paul |date=November 20, 2018 |work=[[Forbes]] |access-date=November 20, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2018/11/20/fallout-76-review-xbox-one-x-look-upon-my-works-and-despair/#3514c2af5e67 |archive-date=November 20, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]'' described the game as a "bizarre, boring, broken mess", adding that, shortly after its launch, it should be considered as a "failed experiment".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-20-fallout-76-review-a-bizarre-boring-and-broken-mess |title=Fallout 76 review - a bizarre, boring, broken mess |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |date=November 20, 2018 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |access-date=November 20, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-20-fallout-76-review-a-bizarre-boring-and-broken-mess |archive-date=November 20, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Business Insider]]'' described ''Fallout 76'' as "a jumble of disparate video game elements set loose in an online world, held together by a string of pointless fetch quests and experience points".&lt;ref name="Business-Insider"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/fallout-76-ps4-review-2018-11 |title=The new 'Fallout' game is a boring mess that you shouldn't play — here's why |last=Gilbert |first=Ben |date=November 20, 2018 |work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=November 20, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://www.businessinsider.com/fallout-76-ps4-review-2018-11 |archive-date=November 20, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' said that moments of the enjoyment during their review were "outweighed by the near-constant performance issues and poorly executed game systems", adding that they were disappointed at the game despite being a fan of the series.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newsweek.com/fallout-76-review-bad-sucks-trash-disappointment-broken-1225686 |title=THE BROKEN PROMISE OF 'FALLOUT 76' (REVIEW) |last=Mozuch |first=Mo |date=November 20, 2018 |work=[[Newsweek]] |access-date=November 20, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://www.newsweek.com/fallout-76-review-bad-sucks-trash-disappointment-broken-1225686 |archive-date=November 20, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[PCWorld]]'' ended their review early due to their frustration with the game's technical performance, and said that it still would not be a great game to them even if it "functioned properly".&lt;ref name="PCWorld"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3323056/gaming/fallout-76-review.html |title=Fallout 76 review: Almost hell, West Virginia |last=Dingman |first=Hayman |date=November 21, 2018 |work=[[PCWorld]] |access-date=November 21, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3323056/gaming/fallout-76-review.html |archive-date=November 21, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' wrote that ''Fallout 76'' may be the "most badly made video game" they had ever seen from a major publisher. They further described the game as "a disastrous failure" whose technical shortcomings may one day be fixed, but whose "design failings and obliviousness to its own potential" suggested that it was "irrevocably broken".&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/21/fallout-76-review-a-bad-idea-poorly-executed-8162807/ |title=Fallout 76 review – a bad idea, poorly executed |last= |first= |date=November 21, 2018 |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |access-date=November 21, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/21/fallout-76-review-a-bad-idea-poorly-executed-8162807/ |archive-date=November 21, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GameSpot]]'' said that the game "can look and feel like its illustrious predecessors at times, but it's a soulless husk of an experience."&lt;ref name="Gamespot"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-review-scorched-earth/1900-6417040/ |title=Fallout 76 Review: Scorched Earth |last=Tran| first=Edmond|date=November 22, 2018 |work=[[Gamespot]] |access-date=November 22, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-review-scorched-earth/1900-6417040/ |archive-date=November 22, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[IGN]], "The rich wasteland map of ''Fallout 76'' is wasted on a mess of bugs, conflicting ideas, and monotony."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/22/fallout-76-review |title=Fallout 76 Review |last=Tyrrel| first=Brandin|date=November 21, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=November 21, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/22/fallout-76-review |archive-date=November 22, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Giant Bomb]]'' has said they will not publish a full review due to disinterest of the staff to play it enough to reach a final verdict. Editor and co-founder [[Jeff Gerstmann]] stated on their podcast "No one on staff wants to play anymore of this video game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.giantbomb.com/shows/559-chocolate-upgrade/2970-17739|title=Giant Bombcast: 559: Chocolate Upgrade|website=Giant Bomb|publisher=Giant Bomb|host=GiantBomb.com|date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was also criticized for the complete absence of interactive human NPCs. ''GameSpot'' said that "without having any of those people present to tell their stories personally, [''Fallout 76'']'s world is limited to being little more than just an environmental exhibit with things to kill", and that "there are no strong emotional anchors to help you become truly invested...". They also wrote that quests simply exist of "long monologues and one-way directives from a person who no longer exists and you can't interact with ... your actions ultimately won't affect anyone, or the rest of the world for that matter".&lt;ref name="Gamespot"/&gt; PC World similarly took issue, writing "robots aren't really NPCs as much as quest dispensers ... they don't talk with you, they talk at you". Additionally, they disliked the readable terminals and holotapes: "none of it feels important or even particularly interesting" as they were "no substitute for an actual conversation".&lt;ref name="PCWorld"/&gt;

Further controversy surrounding  ''Fallout 76'' arose upon the release of the game's Power Armor special edition. Bethesda advertised that the edition would include a canvas [[duffel bag]], but a [[nylon]] one was included instead. Responding to customer complaints, Bethesda revealed that the bag had to be changed due to unavailability of materials. The publisher received criticism for not making the change known beforehand, with ''Eurogamer'' pointing out that the bag's description on Bethesda's website had only changed to read "nylon" after complaints had been submitted. Bethesda later offered affected customers free in-game currency as compensation, equating to $5.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kent |first1=Emma |title=Bethesda offers 500 Atoms to customers affected by Fallout 76 bag-gate |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-29-bethesda-pledges-500-atoms-to-customers-affected-by-fallout-76-bag-gate |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Plunkett |first1=Luke |title=$200 Fallout 76 Edition Promised Fancy Bag, Delivers Nylon Trash Instead [Update: Bethesda Responds] |url=https://kotaku.com/200-fallout-76-edition-promised-fancy-bag-delivers-ny-1830724582 |website=Kotaku |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been discovered that Bethesda had given a different canvas bag to online influencers, further adding fan outrage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-01-turns-out-bethesda-did-make-fallout-76-canvas-bags-and-gave-them-out-to-influencers&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
Upon launch, ''Fallout 76'' debuted at third place in the UK's all-format sales charts, behind ''[[Spyro Reignited Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Phillips |first1=Tom |title=Spyro sold more physical copies at launch than Fallout 76 |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-19-spyro-sold-more-physical-copies-at-launch-than-fallout-76 |website=Eurogamer |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=November 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119141527/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-19-spyro-sold-more-physical-copies-at-launch-than-fallout-76# |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game saw a price drop in North America less than one week after its initial release, with some pundits listing poor sales as a reason for the cut in price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tassi |first1=Paul |title=After A Historically Bad Launch, Is 'Fallout 76' Worth Saving? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/11/23/after-a-historically-bad-launch-is-fallout-76-worth-saving/#28a6f3a8320f |website=Forbes |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=November 23, 2018 |archive-url=|dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fantasy Interactive Scenarios by Telephone''''' ('''''F.I.S.T.''''') were a series of single-player telephone-based [[roleplaying games]] launched by UK games designer [[Steve Jackson (UK game designer)|Steve Jackson]] in 1988 through the company Computerdial, who until then had used their service to provide astrology services. The product was a [[radio drama]] version of Jackson's popular ''[[Fighting Fantasy]]'' novels, and the outcome of the story could be affected by choices the user made, using a [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|touch-tone telephone]]. A free starter pack could be ordered by sending a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] to the game creators.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Two scenarios were produced for the ''F.I.S.T.'' game. The first of these was released under the title ''F.I.S.T. 1 – Castle Mammon: Lair of the Demon Prince'' in September 1988, and the second was a direct sequel titled ''F.I.S.T. 2 – The Rings of Allion'' in March 1989.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Players could register over the phone and create a character, which would be saved and restored the next time the player called. Both games were [[dungeon crawl]]s, depicting the player's unnamed character progressing through the titular Castle Mammon in an attempt to slay the Demon Prince Kaddis Ra. The games featured sound effects and voice-overs illustrating the adventures of the character. Combat consisted of the player being read a description of what their opponent was doing, and pushing a key combination to take action or cast a spell in response. The game could be saved and quit at any time by pushing 9, and the last message could be repeated by pushing 0. Although a solo-game, players could hear the high scores of other players, and physical gold coins were awarded monthly to the highest scoring players.&lt;ref name="FFG"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fightingfantasygamebooks.com/material_fist.htm |title=Fighting Fantasy Material: FIST |website=Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks |publisher=Wizard Books |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625120335/http://www.fightingfantasygamebooks.com/material_fist.htm |archive-date=June 25, 2008 |dead-url=yes |access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=583 Scan of an ad for the game]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{In popular culture|section|date=December 2017}}
The sketch comedy ''[[Limmy's Show|Limmy's Show!]]'' features a ''F.I.S.T.''-esque parody called "Adventure Call", using the same formula with fantasy scenarios hosted by a costumed narrator, "Falconhoof" (played by [[Brian Limond]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2079">"'''Four in One'''" is a [[bebop]] composition by [[Thelonious Monk]] first recorded in &lt;!--(1948?)--&gt; 1951 on [[Blue Note Records discography|Blue Note 1589]] with [[Sahib Shihab]] (alto saxophone), [[Milt Jackson]] (vibraphone), Thelonious Monk (piano), [[Al McKibbon]] (bass), and [[Art Blakey]] (drums).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jazzdisco.org/thelonious-monk/discography/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theloniousrecords.com/compositionshtml.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The melody is usually played in medium tempo (~140 bpm). The form is [[Thirty-two-bar form|AABA]] with 8 bars each. Although the title implies otherwise, "Four in One" has no even subdivision of bars or beats; instead, quarter and sixteenth quintuples are employed, the former even subdivided into {{Clarification needed|reason=triplets would be 12 per bar.|date=April 2018|text=triples which makes an even subdivision of 15 notes in one bar.}} The unconventional rhythm lets the melody appear more hectic than usual Monk compositions.

The chords for "Four in One", are derived from the [[Jazz standard|standard]] "Five Foot Two", which is also likely the source of the title i.e. each part of the title is a reduction by one of "Five Ft. Two" thus becoming "Four In. One" ("Five" becomes "Four"; Feet (ft.) become "Inches" (in.) and “Two" becomes “One."){{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The composition was released on Blue Note as Blue Note 1589: "The Thelonious Monk Quintet – Four In One / Straight No Chaser" as a [[shellac]], 10" 78 RPM Single in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/Thelonious-Monk-Quintet-Four-In-One-Straight-No-Chaser/release/5871007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Future Cinema''' is a London-based events company specialising in the creation of immersive and social cinema experiences as an alternative to the multiplex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aspden|first=Peter|title=Way, way beyond the multiplex|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/394d4c04-ce3c-11e0-99ec-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1pwc6qSay|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=The Financial TImes|date=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Conceived in 2005, Future Cinema set out to share a cinematic experience by staging large cinema screenings that incorporate aspects of immersive events.
Founder of Future Cinema Fabien Riggall described the idea behind Future Cinema as, "creating an immersive experience in which the audience becomes part of the narrative. It's about creating a social cinema experience where the audience can connect with each other online and at the event."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Future Cinema to turn Canary Wharf into California |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-08/25/future-cinema |work=Wired.co.uk |accessdate=23 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318051904/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-08/25/future-cinema |archivedate=18 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the popularity of alternative cinema experiences in general is due to the banality of the multiplex cinema experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aspden|first=Peter|title=Way, way beyond the multiplex|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/394d4c04-ce3c-11e0-99ec-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1pwc6qSay|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=The Financial TImes|date=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsidiaries ==
Future Cinema as an umbrella brand comprises several subsidiary brands that deliver live, immersive cinema experiences worldwide. Future Cinema's online community is continuously growing and to date encompasses 350,000 Facebook and Twitter followers who are highly engaged with all brands.

=== Secret Cinema ===
In 2007, [[Secret Cinema (events company)|Secret Cinema]] pioneered the form ‘Live Cinema’ by introducing site-specific, immersive cultural experiences. Breaking films – and recently music albums – into their constituent parts and marrying narratives with play-along action, Secret Cinema is a unique participatory social experience. Fuelled by a desire to fill the void left by an over-saturated technological world, it invites audiences to lose themselves in serendipitous, imaginary environments that challenge the way we perceive culture and social interaction.
The first event was a screening of Gus Van Sant's classic ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]'' which screened at Southwark Playhouse in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behind the scenes of Secret Cinema |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/11439/Exclusive-Behind_the_scenes_of_Secret_Cinema.html |work=Time Out |accessdate=21 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326044916/http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/11439/Exclusive-Behind_the_scenes_of_Secret_Cinema.html |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent screenings include ''[[The Third Man]]'' in 2011, ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus (film)]]'' in 2012 and Terry Gilliam's ''[[Brazil (1985 film)]]'' in 2013. Making use of abandoned or disused buildings, Secret Cinema explores narratives as well as space in its productions.

=== Future Shorts ===
[[Future Shorts]] is a short film label founded in 2003 to create a platform for new filmmakers to showcase their work.
As well as hosting a monthly short film festival, Future Shorts created an online community that screens short films by filmmakers from all over the world. Anyone, anywhere can get involved in hosting their own short film event by signing up on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future Shorts Website|url=http://www.futureshorts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, Future Shorts are screened on 6 continents, in 90 countries and over 300 cities worldwide, including Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Greece, Lebanon, Mexico, Palestine, Scotland, South Korea and Vietnam.

Audiences were encouraged to dress in black-tie and to carry a flower for a lover or a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Other Cinema Presents 'Brief Encounter'|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/the-other-cinema-presents-brief-encounter|work=clashmusic.com|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Creator and Founder of Future Cinema Fabien Riggall described the intention of The Other Cinema, "to bring back the idea of local cinema and allow the most important films both old and new to get seen and talked about.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Other Cinema Screens Brief Encounter|url=http://londonist.com/2012/01/ticket-alert-the-other-cinema-screens-brief-encounter.php|work=londonist.com|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goes TV Tower''' ({{lang-nl|Televisietoren Goes}}) is a broadcast tower near [[Goes]], [[Netherlands]].

The tower was the first TV tower in the Netherlands, and is currently owned by [[Alticom]], but the area around the tower is owned by [[KPN]], whilst the antenna is owned by [[NOVEC]]. In 2007 a new antenna was installed, which is {{convert|11|m|ft|1}} shorter than the previous antenna.

The '''Golden Raspberry Awards''' (also known in short terms as '''Razzies''' and '''Razzie Awards''') is a [[Booby prize|mock award]] in recognition of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst in film]]. Co-founded by UCLA film graduates and film industry veterans  [[John J. B. Wilson]] and Mo Murphy, the annual Razzie Awards ceremony in Los Angeles precedes the corresponding [[Academy Awards]] ceremony by one day. The term ''[[wikt:raspberry|raspberry]]'' in the name is used in its irreverent sense, as in "[[blowing a raspberry]]". The awards themselves are in the form of a "golf ball-sized raspberry" atop a [[Super 8 mm film]] reel, all spray painted gold.

The [[1st Golden Raspberry Awards|first Golden Raspberry Awards]] ceremony was held on March 31, 1981, at [[John J. B. Wilson]]'s living-room alcove in Los Angeles, to honor the worst in film of the [[1980 in film|1980 film season]]. The [[38th Golden Raspberry Awards|38th ceremony]] was held on March 3, 2018.

==History==
[[File:John Wilson at 29th Razzie Awards.jpg|thumb|left|[[John J. B. Wilson]] at the [[29th Golden Raspberry Awards]] in 2009.]]
American [[publicist]] [[John J. B. Wilson]] traditionally held [[potluck|potluck parties]] at his house in Los Angeles on the night of the [[Academy Award]]s.&lt;ref name="lindrea"&gt;{{cite news | last =Lindrea | first =Victoria | title =Blowing raspberries at Tinseltown |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC | date =February 25, 2007 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6392701.stm | accessdate = 2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, after the [[53rd Academy Awards]] had completed for the evening, Wilson invited friends to give random award presentations in his living room.&lt;ref name="lindrea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="larsen"&gt;{{cite news | last =Larsen | first =Peter | title =The Morning Read – So bad, they're almost good – A love of movies lies behind the Razzies | work =[[The Orange County Register]] | page =1 | date = January 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson decided to formalize the event, after watching a double feature of ''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' and ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]''.&lt;ref name="germain"&gt;{{cite news | last =Germain | first =David ([[Associated Press]]) | title =25 Years of Razzing Hollywood's Stinkers | work =[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] | page =7D | publisher =Sun-Sentinel Company | date =February 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave them ballots to vote on worst in film.&lt;ref name="germain" /&gt; Wilson stood at a podium made of cardboard in a tacky tuxedo, with a foam ball attached to a broomstick as a fake microphone, and announced ''Can't Stop the Music'' as the first [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]].&lt;ref name="germain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marder" /&gt; The impromptu ceremony was a success and the following week a press release about his event released by Wilson was picked up by a few local newspapers, including a mention in the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' with the headline: "Take These Envelopes, Please".&lt;ref name="lindrea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="larsen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marder"&gt;{{cite news | last =Marder | first =Jenny | title =Razzin' The Dregs of Hollywood Dreck – Film: Cerritos' John Wilson Marks His Golden Raspberry Awards' 25th Year With A Guide To Cinematic Slumming | work =[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]] | page =A1 | date =February 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately three dozen people came to the [[1st Golden Raspberry Awards]].&lt;ref name="marder" /&gt; The [[2nd Golden Raspberry Awards]] had double the attendance as the first, and the [[3rd Golden Raspberry Awards|3rd awards ceremony]] 
in turn, had double this number.&lt;ref name="marder" /&gt; By the [[4th Golden Raspberry Awards]] ceremony, [[CNN]] and two major wire services covered the event.&lt;ref name="lindrea" /&gt; Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards before the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: "We finally figured out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, but if you went the night before, when the press from all over the world are here and they are looking for something to do, it could well catch on," he said to [[BBC News]].&lt;ref name="lindrea" /&gt;

The term ''raspberry'' is used in its irreverent sense, as in "[[blowing a raspberry]]".&lt;ref name="dawson48"&gt;{{cite book | last =Dawson | first =Jim | title =Blame it on the dog: a modern history of the fart | publisher =Ten Speed Press | year =2006 | isbn =978-1-58008-751-3|pages=48–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson commented to the author of ''Blame It on the Dog'': "When I registered the term with the Library of Congress in 1980, they asked me, 'Why ''raspberry''? What's the significance of that?' But since then, ''razz'' has pretty much permeated the culture. We couldn't have done it without Hollywood's help."&lt;ref name="dawson48" /&gt; Wilson is referred to as "Ye Olde Head Razzberry".&lt;ref name="crouse"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crouse | first = Richard | title = Reel Winners: Movie Award Trivia | publisher = Dundurn Press Ltd | year = 2005 | pages= 103, 208 | isbn =978-1-55002-574-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contradicting awards==
Three people won both the Razzies and Oscars the same weekend: [[Alan Menken]] in 1993, [[Brian Helgeland]] in 1998, and Sandra Bullock in 2010, although all three for different films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/01/razzie-awards-razzies-nominations-7594106284-news-story-article.html|title=Razzie Award nominations: Can Sandra Bullock win worst AND best actress?|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two actors had performances in the same movie scoring Oscar and Razzie nominations, [[James Coco]] (''[[Only When I Laugh (film)|Only When I Laugh]]'') and [[Amy Irving]] (''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/awards/2011/01/quiz-which-role-was-nominated-for-a-razzie-and-oscar.html|title=Quiz: Which role was nominated for a Razzie and an Oscar?|date=26 January 2011|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Diamond]], winner of the inaugural Worst Actor Razzie for 1980s ''[[The Jazz Singer (1980 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'', was nominated for the [[Golden Globe]] in the same role. The [[Aerosmith]] song "[[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing]]", as part of the original soundtrack to the 1998 film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'', was nominated for both an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and a [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song]], as was the [[Trisha Yearwood]] song "[[How Do I Live]]" from the 1997 film ''[[Con Air]]'' and the [[Tony Bennett]] song "Life in a Looking Glass" from the 1986 film ''[[That's Life! (film)|That's Life!]]''. In 1981, [[Stanley Kubrick]] was nominated both for a Razzie Award as Worst Director at the [[1st Golden Raspberry Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1981 ''Razzie Awards for 1981] at IMDB.com&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for a [[Saturn Award for Best Director]] at the [[8th Saturn Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000004/1981 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, USA] on IMDB.com&lt;/ref&gt; for the same film: ''[[The Shining (film)|''The Shining]]''.

''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987) is the only film to date to win both an Oscar and a Razzie. Michael Douglas won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]],&lt;ref name="Gorney"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gorney |first=Cynthia |title=Douglas and Cher Win Acting Honors |work=[[Washington Post]] |pages= |publisher= |date=April 12, 1988 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Daryl Hannah]]'s performance was not as well received and earned her a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress.

====Anniversary Awards====
Every decade-closing ceremony includes an award for the worst actors and movies of the decade—though the 2000 ceremony put the actors as worst of the 20th century instead. Special prizes for the 25th anniversary of the Razzies awards were also given out in 2005.

== Criticism ==
The Razzies have received criticism, including from news sources such as ''[[Indiewire]]''&lt;ref name="blogs.indiewire.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/why-the-razzies-are-the-worst-awards-ever-20150105|title=Why the Razzies Are the Worst Awards Ever|author=Sam Adams|date=5 January 2015|website=Criticwire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'',&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10669966/Why-I-hate-the-Razzies.html|title=Why I hate the Razzies|date=1 March 2016|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; for several issues, including that members of the Golden Raspberry Foundation are not required to watch the nominated movies,&lt;ref name="blogs.indiewire.com"/&gt; and that seemingly anyone can join the Golden Raspberry Foundation, so long as they pay at least $40,&lt;ref name="blogs.indiewire.com"/&gt; which is different from the invitation-only [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/about/become-new-member|title=HOW TO BECOME A MEMBER|website=Oscars.org - Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics take issue with the Razzies picking "easy targets" and mainstream films instead of those perceived as less popular but more deserving productions,&lt;ref name=crave&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/942899-easy-targets-razzies-pick-year#LWWkuOBHDvy3xX32.99|title=Which Easy Targets Did The Razzies Pick This Year? - CraveOnline|date=13 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; continuing to appeal to celebrities, seemingly for publicity and attention, over other, worthier films and performances.&lt;ref name="blogs.indiewire.com"/&gt;

Sam Adams of ''Indiewire'' has said the Razzies are "like hecklers hurling insults at comedians or a concertgoer yelling out 'Whoo!' during a quiet song, they're not-so-secretly crying out to be noticed. The Razzies, properly enough, avoid pouncing on the little guy; they don't trash no-budget indies no one has seen for having bad lighting or terrible sound".&lt;ref name="blogs.indiewire.com"/&gt; Robbie Collin of ''The Daily Telegraph'' has said "the Razzies' ongoing failure to train its sights on anything but the most obvious targets means it grows more tired and redundant by the year".&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; [[CraveOnline]]'s  William Bibbiani stated that the Razzies follow "a cheap shot of pranksterism", and "with only a handful of exceptions, only seen fit to nominate the most infamous movies of the year, and not necessarily the worst."&lt;ref name=crave/&gt; Carolyn Burke of [[Cracked.com]] describes the awards as "a ramshackle operation run by a bunch of lazy [[Internet troll|trolls]] who are guilty of all the same smug self-importance they claim to be lampooning" and further states that "the Razzies are an antiquated 'joke' that has long outlived any goodwill or relevance they once had, and have become nothing more than a mean-spirited cesspool of joyless criticism worse than any of the movies they tear down with artless comedy."&lt;ref name=cracked&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_24629_4-reasons-razzies-suck-even-more-than-oscars.html|title=4 Reasons The Razzies Suck (And Should Be Abolished Forever)|date=22 February 2017|author=Carolyn Burke|accessdate=13 May 2017|website=Cracked.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4248">{{Unreferenced|date=June 2016}}'''Guignol''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡiɲɔl|lang}}) is the main character in a French [[Puppetry|puppet show]] which has come to bear his name. It represents the workers in the silk industry of France.

Although often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent [[Lyon]] troupe: "Guignol amuses children… and witty adults".

[[Image:Guignol.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A Guignol show being performed in Paris.]]
[[File:Guignol de Lyon.JPG|thumb|Flageolet (left), Guignol (right)]]
[[Laurent Mourguet]], Guignol's creator, was born into a family of modest silk weavers on March 3, 1769. The certificate of his marriage to Jeanne Esterle in 1788 shows he was unable to read. When hard times fell on the silk trade during the French Revolution, he became a peddler, and in 1797 started to practice [[dentistry]], which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. The service was free; the money was made from the medicines sold afterward to ease the pain. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist's chair. In the end, his strategy worked very well to his advantage. 

His first shows featured [[Pulcinella|Polichinelle]], a character borrowed from the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] who in England would become [[Punch and Judy|Punch]]. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol's wife Madelon and the [[Gendarmerie|gendarme]] Flageolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes.

Although nominally a silkweaver like much of his original audience, Guignol's profession changes, as does his marital status; he can be in turn valet, peddler, carpenter, shoemaker, or unemployed; at times he is Madelon's husband, at times her smitten suitor according to requirements of the scenario. What remain constant are his poverty, but more importantly his good humor and his sense of justice. The use in French of "guignol" as an insult meaning "buffoon" is a curious misnomer, as Guignol is clever, courageous and generous; his inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil. 

Sixteen of Mourguet's children and grandchildren continued his tradition, and many of the companies performing today can trace their artistic heritage back to him although Laurent Morguet´s last descendant - Jean-Guy Morguet - died October 8, 2012, at the age of 82, after working all his life in the Theatre de Guignol at Lyon, France. Jean-Guy, learnt his job helping his grandmother Augustine and then his parents. He became, later, the director of the whole theatre until his death. Laurent Mourguet maintained according to the era, the region, or the performers. Guignol's original caustic satire has often been watered down to simple children's fare, and has even been used to parody grand opera, but his original spirit still survives in his hometown of Lyon, where both traditional and original contemporary performances are an integral part of local culture. In addition to his social satire, Guignol has become an important protector of the local dialect, the ''parler lyonnais''.

'''Honey West''' is a fictional character created by the husband and wife writing team Gloria and Forest Fickling under the [[pseudonym]] "G.G. Fickling", and appearing in eleven [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] novels by the duo.

The character is notable as being one of the first female [[private detectives]] in popular fiction. She first appeared in the 1957 book ''This Girl for Hire'' and would appear in nine novels before being retired in the mid-1960s, with two comeback novels in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Colleen ''Mystery Women: An Encyclopedia of Leading Women Characters in Mystery Fiction, Volume 1: 1860-1979'' Poisoned Pen Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The Honey West character was created by Gloria and Forrest E. "Skip" Fickling under the [[pseudonym]] "G.G. Fickling" in the late 1950s.

Forrest Fickling had been a [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Air Gunner]] during [[World War II]]; he enlisted in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] Reserve after the war, and as a member of that service was called back to active duty during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysteryfile.com/Honey%20West/Honey_West.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The G.G. represented the initials of his wife, Gloria Gautraud, whom he had married in 1949. The initials were used so the sex of the author would remain vague.
Though Gloria said that most of the writing was done by Forrest, he said her ideas helped make the female character more plausible and gave her a good dress sense. Gloria had been an assistant fashion editor at [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'' magazine]] and a fashion writer for ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]''.
Forrest told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "I first thought of [[Marilyn Monroe]], and then I thought of [fictional detective] [[Mike Hammer]] and decided to put the two together... We thought the most used name for someone you really like is Honey. And she lives in the West, so there was her name."&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Los Angeles Times http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/11/local/me-38189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. The word count for a plot summary is between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
Several years before [[Insidious (film)|the Lambert haunting]], teenager Quinn Brenner meets with retired [[demonology|demonologist]] Elise Rainier.  Elise reluctantly agrees to try and contact the spirit of Quinn's mother, Lillith, who died one year prior. However, Elise urges Quinn not to try and contact her mother again after sensing a malevolent force.  After auditioning for a school for the performing arts, Quinn sees a mysterious figure waving to her from the distance on the street. Distracted, she is hit by a car, having both of her legs broken in the process. 

Now stuck in her home with her father Sean and brother Alex, Quinn begins to experience increasingly disturbing [[paranormal|paranormal phenomena]], including seeing visions of a dark spirit wearing an oxygen mask known as the "Man Who Can't Breathe"—the same figure that caused her accident.  One of Quinn's neighbors, an elderly woman with [[dementia]] who had previously said several confusing and cryptic things to her about the "Man Who Can't Breathe", passes away.

Sean meets with Elise, whom like him is also grieving after the death of her husband Jack, and tries to convince her to help his daughter.  Elise declines, stating that her previous visits to the dark spiritual world of the "Further" made her realize that an evil spirit is hunting her. However, she is convinced by her friend and former colleague Carl to continue using her spiritual ability, after he reminds her about her successful [[Insidious: Chapter 2|case involving Josh Lambert]] in 1986, and stating that she is stronger than any spirits or demons because she is living and they are not.

Due to Elise's refusal, Alex suggests Sean call on alleged demonologists Specs and Tucker, who have built a following on the [[internet]]. During their investigation, Quinn becomes briefly possessed by the "Man Who Can't Breathe," breaks through her leg braces, and attempts to attack Sean, Specs, and Tucker. Sean realizes Specs and Tucker are [[confidence trick|frauds,]] and prepares to kick the duo out until Elise arrives. Deducing that the dark spirit's goal is to lure potential victims to "the Further" so it can eat their life force, Elise decides to enter the spiritual world, and enlists Specs and Tucker to help.

Elise enters the Further and has a brief fight with the evil spirit that haunts her (a mysterious [[Insidious: Chapter 2|"Bride in Black"]]), before she discovers Jack's spirit.  Jack begins to encourage Elise to commit [[suicide]] so that they might be reunited.  Elise realizes that Jack is actually the "Man Who Can't Breathe" in disguise and slashes his face before escaping back to the physical world. Elise realizes that Quinn has to defeat him on her own. Though Quinn is at first at a disadvantage, Elise receives a message from Quinn's deceased neighbor: Lillith had left Quinn a letter to read before she graduated High School, but Quinn never found it. Lillith's spirit suddenly appears in the Further and helps Quinn defeat the "Man Who Can't Breathe." Elise gives parting words to the family, including words of encouragement from Lillith's spirit.  She leaves with Specs and Tucker, and the three agree to form a partnership.

Later, Elise arrives home and notices her dog barking at something. Suddenly, [[Insidious (film)|a demon with a red face]] appears behind her.

On September 15, 2013, a third installment in the ''Insidious'' series was announced, with [[Leigh Whannell]] signed on to return as writer, and [[Jason Blum]] and [[Oren Peli]] set to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title=''INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER THREE'' Moving Forward; Leigh Whannell Returning to Write the Script|url=http://collider.com/insidious-3-sequel-leigh-whannell|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=September 16, 2013|date=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about returning for another sequel, actor [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] went on to say that he "[doesn't] know where else it could go", and that "[Josh Lambert has] been through the wringer, and I think the movie sets it up well at the end [...] And that's great, that's how it should end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Nigel M.|title=Patrick Wilson On Why There Won't Be an ''Insidious 3'' and His Love for ''Conjuring'' Director James Wan|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/patrick-wilson-on-why-there-wont-be-an-insidious-3-and-his-love-for-director-james-wan?page=2#articleHeaderPanel|work=[[Indiewire]]|accessdate=September 16, 2013|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 13, 2013, it was announced [[Focus Features]] and [[Stage 6 Films]] would release the film on April 3, 2015.

Kerry Lengel of ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, saying "''Insidious: Chapter 3'' is almost more a spoof of a classic like ''The Exorcist'' than it is an homage.

But given its distinguished forebears, ''Insidious: Chapter 3'' doesn’t quite live up to expectations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/06/movie-review-insidious-chapter-3.html |title=Movie Review: Insidious: Chapter 3 |work=Vulture |date=2015-06-05 |accessdate=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In an interview Leigh Whannell was asked "If there is a fourth ''Insidious'' film, would that be a sequel to ''Chapter 3'', another prequel to the original or will it continue in this timeline or go to a whole new timeline?" Whannell stated: "I don't know. I haven't really thought about it yet. But for the purposes of this interview, I'll say that I'd like to explore the time between this film and the first film. That whole area there where Elise has rediscovered her gift, I think you could have a lot of adventures before she arrives. So I think there is a lot of room there. We've kind of established Lin [Shaye] in this particular film as kind of this superhero, so that would be kind of interesting to explore in the other films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/leigh-whannell-discusses-ideas-insidious-4/|title=Insidious: Chapter 4 Will Take Place Closer To First Film|author=Isaac Feldberg|work=We Got This Covered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Insidious: The Last Key]]'' was announced in May 2016 for a release date of October 20, 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">'''John Carbutt''' (1832-1905) was the first person to use [[celluloid]] for photographic film.

He was born in [[Sheffield]], England on 2 December 1832.  He moved to Chicago in 1853.

Carbutt founded the [[Keystone Dry Plate Works]] in 1879 and was the first to develop sheets of [[celluloid]] coated with [[photographic emulsion]] for making [[celluloid (film)|celluloid film]] in 1888. Carbutt sliced thin plates from a rigid celluloid block, and then coated them with a silver gelatin emulsion to make a Celluloid Dry plate. Around 1890 he made them in a 35&amp;nbsp;mm width for [[William Kennedy Dickson]]'s [[Kinetoscope]], which set the [[35 mm film]] standard for [[motion picture camera]]s and still [[camera]]s. That format is still the dominant format to this day, as the majority of high end [[digital camera]]s use a 35mm sensor and 35mm film is still being used by a significant number of photographers and film makers.&lt;ref name="hic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historiccamera.com/cgi-bin/librarium2/pm.cgi?action=app_display&amp;app=datasheet&amp;app_id=1782&amp;|title=John Carbutt at Historic Camera - History Librarium|date=23 March 2012|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latin rock''' is a term to describe a music subgenre consisting in melting traditional sounds and elements of Latin American and Caribbean folk with [[rock music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latin Rock |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/latin-rock-ma0000011908 |work=Allmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latin Rock definition |url=http://www.imusicdictionary.com/definition.php?term=Latin%20rock |work=Imusicdictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heatley |first1=Michael |title=Rock &amp; Pop.

== History ==

=== Origins (1950s–1960s) ===
[[File:Sir Douglas Quintet 1965.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;[[Sir Douglas Quintet]] were an American rock band that experimented with Latin folk elements during the 1960s.&lt;/small&gt;]] Rock and Roll music of the 1950s originated from a variety of sources including African-American rhythm and blues, blues, gospel, country and western, bluegrass, western swing, and Tin Pan Alley pop music. Also, there was some influence of the traditional Latin music on it. Caribbean rhythms like [[Calypso music|calypso]] were remarkable on [[surf music]]; and there were some rock and roll songs based on [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-chá]] or [[mambo (music)|mambo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pallan |first1=Michelle H. |title=Loca Motion: The Travels of Chicana/Latina Popular Culture |date=2005 |publisher=NYU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin Rock (term not yet created) was born in the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=David Reyes |first1=Tom Waldman |title=Land of a Thousand Dances: Chicano rock 'n' roll from Southern California |date=1998 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=0-8263-1929-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; at late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Loza |first1=Joseph Steven |title=Barrio Rhythm: Mexican American music in Los Angeles |date=1993 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0-252-06288-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 and adaptation of a Mexican folk song called “[[La Bamba (song)|La bamba]]” by the [[chicano rock]] artist [[Ritchie Valens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mendheim |first1=Beverly |title=Ritchie Valens: The First Latino Rocker |date=1987 |publisher=Bilingual Review Press |isbn=978-0-916950-79-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, instrumental rock band [[The Champs]] released "[[Tequila (song)|Tequila]]", that incorporates clear Latin sounds (composed by chicano [[Danny Flores]]).

During the 1960s, there were more examples of rock artists like [[Thee Midniters]], [[Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Guerrero |first1=Mark |title=Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians: The First Punk Rock Band |url=http://www.markguerrero.com/36.php |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam the Sham|Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sam the Sham &amp; the Pharaos |url=http://www.classicbands.com/samsham.html |work=Classic Bands}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Sir Douglas Quintet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Huey |first1=Steve |title=Sir Douglas Quintet - A Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-sir-douglas-quintet-mn0000018708/biography |work=Allmusic.com |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that included Latin rhythms on their compositions. Also the rise of the [[chicano rock]] in [[California]] joined; although not all of them could be considered as early Latin rock artists since many of them lacked the Latin folk influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=David Reyes |first1=Tom Waldman |title=Land of a Thousand Dances: Chicano rock 'n' roll from Southern California |date=1998 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=0-8263-1929-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, at some Latin American countries, Latin rock started to develop on [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] or [[Argentina]], but specially [[Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunn |first1=Christopher |title=Brutality Garden: Tropicália and the Emergence of a Brazilian Counterculture. |date=2001 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=0-8078-4976-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; where '''[[Tropicália]]''' appeared at mid-1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tropicalia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/tropicalia-ma0000002805 |work=Allmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first releases of [[Os Mutantes]], [[Gal Costa]] and [[Caetano Veloso]] from 1967 to 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mei |first1=Giancarlo |title=Canto Latino: Origine, Evoluzione e Protagonisti della Musica Popolare del Brasile |date=2004 |publisher=Stampa Alternativa-Nuovi Equilibri|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; a music movement that melt rock music with [[bossa nova]], [[psychedelia]] and other Latin elements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riccardo Pesanha |first1=Chris McGowan |title=The Brazilian Sound: Samba, Bossa Nova and the Popular Music of Brazi |date=1998 |publisher=Philadelphia: Temple University Press |isbn=1-56639-545-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been regarded as the main root of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Júnior |first1=Gonçalo |title=La (in)digestión del Tropicalismo. |url=http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/es/2007/10/01/la-indigestion-del-tropicalismo/ |work=Pesquisa-FAPESP |date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Latin Rock" term born (1970s) ===

[[File:Santana (1971).png|left|thumb|American band '''[[Santana (band)|Santana]]''' in 1971]] In 1969, after the release of the debut album by [[Santana (band)|Santana]], Latin rock appeared in the US and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woog |first1=Adam |title=Carlos Santana: Legendary Guitarist (The Twentieth Century's Most Influential Hispanics) |date=2006 |publisher=Lucent Books |isbn=978-1-59018-972-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They treated to describe the band's music style as a fusion of Latin American and Caribbean rhythms, [[soul music|soul]], [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[blues]], [[psychedelia]] and [[rhythm and blues]] based on [[rock music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pasceri |first1=Carlo |title=Santana: Love, Devotion &amp; Surrender (Storie di Musica Vol.1) |date=2015 |publisher=Libro digital-Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leng |first1=Simon |title=Santana |publisher=Cátedra (colección Pop-Rock) |isbn=978-84-376-1947-7|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Santana (band)|Santana]], other American bands appeared like [[Malo (band)|Malo]], [[Ocho (band)|Ocho]], [[Mandrill (band)|Mandrill]], [[El Chicano]], [[Eddie Palmieri's Harlem River Drive]], [[War (band)|War]], [[Sapo (band)|Sapo]] and [[Azteca (band)|Azteca]] at early 1970s popularizing the genre in the USA and the rest of the world since 1970-71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillet |first1=Charlie |title=Historia del Rock. El sonido de la ciudad |date=2008 |publisher=Ma Non Troppo Ediciones |isbn=978-84-96924-39-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin American counterpart Latin rock bands appeared as it could be seen in [[Peru]] with bands like [[Telegraph Avenue]], [[Traffic Sound]], [[The Mad's]], [[El Polen]] and specially [[Black Sugar]] melting rock with jazz music, Peruvian folk, [[progressive rock]] and Latin elements; in [[Colombia]] highlighted [[Siglo Cero]], [[Génesis (Colombia)|Génesis]] and [[La Columna de Fuego]]; in [[Argentina]] [[Arco Iris (band)|Arco Iris]]; and in [[Chile]], [[Los Jaivas]].

The genre arrived also in [[Europe]], with the Spaniards [[Barrabás]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ordovás |first1=Jesús |title=Historia de la música Pop española |date=1987 |publisher=Alianza editorial |isbn=978-84-206-0224-0|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch [[Massada (band)|Massada]] and African-British [[Osibisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aniagolu |first1=Charles |title=Osibisa - Living In The State Of Happy Vibes And Criss Cross Rhythms |date=2004 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=1-4120-2106-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Reggae]] music achieved a great success around the world. This rhythm originated in [[Jamaica]] arose during the 1960s, evolving from [[ska]], [[rocksteady]] and bluebeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Lloyd |title=This Is Reggae Music: The Story of Jamaica's Music |date=2001 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=978-0-8021-3828-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its origins along with rock music and rhythm and blues with Jamaican folk rhythms, the [[Caribbean]] and Continental Latin America elements influenced the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Stephen |title=Reggae Bloodlines: In Search Of The Music And Culture Of Jamaica |date=1992 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-80496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Reggae]] or [[Ska]] have never considered as part of the Latin Rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrow |first1=Steve |title=The Rough Guide to Reggae |date=2001 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=978-1-85828-558-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Disco Music]] also influenced Latin rock during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alan Jones |first1=Jussi Kantonen |title=Saturday Night Forever: The Story of Disco |date=1999 |publisher=A Capella Books |isbn=1-55652-411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin rock evolution (1980–Present)===
[[File:Macaco aterciopelados.JPG|thumb|Colombian band '''[[Aterciopelados]]''' with the Spaniard '''[[Macaco (band)|Macaco]]'''.]] After [[punk rock|punk]] eclosion at late 1970s, the genre also was influenced by many other music styles. Some British punk and [[new wave]] acts like [[The Clash]] included elements that could be considered as "latin" in "[[Sandinista!]]" (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gendre |first1=Marcos |title=The Clash: La única banda que importa |date=2015 |publisher=Quarentena |isbn=978-84-16229-11-6|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bands such as [[Bow Wow Wow]], [[Gang Of Four]], [[The Slits]] or [[The Specials|Special AKA]] did so.

[[File:Cafe Tacuba Pontevedra.jpg|left|thumb|Mexican band '''[[Café Tacuba]]''']] In Spain, [[Los Coyotes]], [[Los Mestizos]] and [[Radio Futura]], that had been emerged as new wave and post-punk acts, finally got influenced by Latin music at mid 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ordovás |first1=Jesús |title=Historia de la música Pop española |date=1987 |publisher=Alianza editorial |isbn=978-84-206-0224-0|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain would go on producing some Latin acts like [[Macaco (band)|Macaco]], [[Amparanoia]] or [[Jarabe de Palo]].

In France, bands like [[Les Negresses Vertes]] played a fusion of rock with [[World music]] including Latin elements. But [[Manu Chao]] was the major success of the Latin rock in France with the band [[Mano Negra (band)|Mano Negra]] (also as a solo artist) with a style that would be known later as '''[[Latin alternative]]'''. A mix of rock, with Latin elements, [[Arabic music]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[rap]], [[flamenco]], [[ska]] and [[reggae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robecchi |first1=Alessandro |title=Manu Chao. Música y Libertad |date=2002 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-84-397-0856-8|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US during this period bands like [[David Byrne]] (ex-leader of [[Talking Heads]]), [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Paul Simon]],  [[Willy Deville]], [[Los Lobos]], [[El Vez]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and [[Rage Against The Machine]] appeared, developing some of these "mixing" sounds (specially in Latin folk sounds)

The genre consolidated during the 1990s in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scaramuzzino |first1=Rubén |title=Algo así como la Biblia de la Cultura Latina |journal=Zona de trabajos |date=2008 |issue=53|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bands appeared such as [[Rio Roma]] (Mexico), [[Maná (band)|Maná]] (Mexico), [[Caifanes]] (Mexico), [[Café Tacuba]] (Mexico), [[Aterciopelados]] (Colombia), [[Paralamas do Sucesso]] (Brazil), [[Bersuit Vergarabat]] (Argentina),  [[Karamelo Santo]] (Argentina), [[Maldita Vecindad]] (Mexico), [[Carmina Burana]] (Argentina), [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]] (Argentina), [[Soda Stereo]] (Argentina), [[Los Tres]] (Chile), [[Octavia (band)|Octavia]] (Bolivia), [[Karnak (band)|Karnak]] (Brazil), [[Chancho en Piedra]] (Chile), [[Julieta Venegas]] (Mexico) and [[Los Rabanes]] (Panama), that incorporated Latin folk rhythms on their compositions (especially [[Caifanes]] and [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]]).

== Controversy about the term ==

[[File:LFCMedellín3.jpg|thumb|Argentine band '''[[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]]''']] At late 1990s, the rising population of "Latinos" in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suárez-Orozco |first1=Marcelo |title=Latinos: Remaking America |date=2008 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-25827-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;(term popularized since the 1960s due to the wrong and confusing use of "[[Spaniards|Spanish]]" term and the unpopular term "[[Hispanic]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=González |first1=Juan |title=Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America |date=2011 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-311928-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; lead music industry to create the [[Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences]] as a sub-department of [[The Recording Academy|National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]. Also in 2000 the [[Latin Grammy Awards]] were created. Thus, a great part of the English media started to refer any kind of music featuring Spanish vocals as "Latin music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Avant-Mier |first1=Roberto |title=Rock the Nation: Latin/o Identities and the Latin Rock Diaspora |date=2010 |publisher=Continuum Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term achieved a great success in some Latin American countries, where some of their regional press started to use the new terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Avant-Mier |first1=Roberto |title=Rock the Nation: Latin/o Identities and the Latin Rock Diaspora |date=2010 |publisher=Continuum Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon spread the use of the "latin rock" term with a completely different meaning of the original one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Varios autores |title=Diccionario del Rock Latino |date=2000 |publisher=Iberautor Promociones Culturales-Zona de trabajos |isbn=978-84-8048-408-4|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lead into a controversy and confusion in the population.

A '''music community''' is a group of people involved in a given type of music. Typically such a community has an informal, supportive structure.
In the past such groups have typically developed within a town or school, where the members can meet physically. The internet has made it possible for a more dispersed music community to use the web for communication, either via specialized websites or through broader social media. Ethnographic studies indicate that online music communities do not center around one website, but use a network of sites, including personal blogs, artist or publisher sites and social media.

==General==

The musician and musicologist [[Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin]] has broadly defined a music community as "a group of interested participants who agree on the form and content of the music and its social contexts".{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=122}}
A music community may be taken to mean a group of people with strong ties who often come together to play and talk about music, but a sense of community may also come from a national educational system that connects young people to their cultural heritage and traditions.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=122–123}}
A more restrictive view limits the term "music community" to teachers, composers, performers and the music distribution industry.{{sfn|National Commission on Music Education|1991|p=xi}}

The concept of music communities is well-developed in [[ethnomusicology]]. A large part of this discipline consists of studies of groups of people who frequently exchange and communicate musical material.{{sfn|Nettl|2005|p=52}}

Barry Shank, writing in 1994 of [[Rock and roll]] in [[Austin, Texas]], used the word "subculture" to define the shifting meanings and membership of musical communities, or cultural spaces. 
Will Straw built on this work, replacing the term "subculture" by "scene".{{sfn|Wolf|2007|p=19}}
Straw saw a "scene" as relatively transient, while a music community is more stable. He wrote in 1991 that a music community engages in "an ongoing exploration of one or more musical idioms said to be rooted within a geographically specific historical heritage."{{sfn|Laughey|2006|p=100}}
Disputing Straw's characterization, later writers have pointed  out that music communities may be mobile and transient.{{sfn|Denzin|2010|p=75}}

Musical communities typically have very flexible structures, voluntary membership and people of a wide range of ages.{{sfn|Colwell|Richardson|2002|p=731}}
They offer participants the opportunity to play different roles including creator, participant or observer. Conscious efforts may be made to involve disadvantaged members. 
Typically the group encourages diversity, and all members are committed to lifetime learning.{{sfn|Colwell|Richardson|2002|p=731}}
When a music community is widespread, aspects of music-making such as repertoire and style may evolve and diverge.{{sfn|Brinner|1995|p=75}}

==Types of music community==

There are many types of music community.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
Women's music communities among the Ewe people of Ghana help create bonds and nurture cooperation between women who would otherwise be pulled apart by competition in their polygamist society.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=23}}
Irish immigrants to the United States were generally keen to assimilate and adopt a new ethnic identity as Americans, but a minority held onto their traditional culture and formed [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]] communities in [[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]] and other cities.{{sfn|Nicholsen|2007|p=3}}
After over one hundred years these communities persisted. The primary reason seems to have simply been the entertainment value.{{sfn|Nicholsen|2007|p=268}}
Teachers may deliberately foster development of a music community within their school, which can assist students in reaching their full potential.{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=4}}
Such teachers may build on the [[Suzuki method]] in the belief that cooperation in group classes plays an important role, and that competition is inappropriate.{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=6}}
According to Mary Ann Froehlich, "Competition isolates, while cooperation creates community. ... Our goal is to build an inclusive music community."{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=7}}

==Online music communities==

One of the early online music communities was established in 1996 by [[Oh Boy Records]], a small independent record company. It took the form of a chat page on its website that let fans of [[John Prine]] exchange views and information. The website became the base of a specialized Prine music community.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=295}}
However, as Prine ceased performing while fighting cancer, and no new recordings were released, the community ran out of information to exchange and went into decline.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=299}}
Oh Boy eventually closed the chat page.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=301}}
Another early online music community that was the subject of an ethnographic study was the Banjo Hangout, established in 2000.
As of 2011 it had about 51,000 members and featured a large online learning center.{{sfn|Waldron|2011|p=32}}
[[imeem]], a social networking site with 28 million monthly visitors, was the first music community to provide ad-supported free online music streaming and downloading. 
Other sites such as [[Myspace]] followed with similar services.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=116}}
Specialized software has been developed to support online music communities.{{sfn|Creative Commons Music Communities}}

[[Online communities]] have emerged for genres of folk music such as [[Bluegrass music|Blue Grass]] and [[Old-time music|Old Time]]. [[Cyber-ethnography]] using the framework of [[Étienne Wenger]]'s [[social learning theory]] shows that sites like this may be considered a [[community of practice]] (CoP).{{sfn|Waldron|2009|p=97}}
The members of an online music community can publish, listen to and evaluate the music they have created, giving them a strong sense of membership. It provides a platform within which members can create a musical identity as well as one in which they can build social bonds.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=51}}
J. P. Williams, writing in 2006 in the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Ethnography]]'', argued that the driving force behind online music communities is the interest of the participants in building their identities, despite the ostensible focus on making and sharing music.{{sfn|Rikandi|2010|p=199, 205}}

A 2013 book notes that in Finland the ''Mikseri'' music portal, with about 140,000 registered users, helps people create, share and discuss their music in this sparsely-populated country.
This web-based community was the object of ethnographic studies in 2008 and 2009 based on theories of sociocultural learning.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=50}}
Members of Mikseri do not exclusively belong to that community, but may belong to other real-world or online communities.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=51}}
An analysis of event-related data from an online music community shows that events on that site often cause increased interest in a given artist, but propagation over links within digital social communities is also an important factor.{{sfn|Tirado|Higuero|Isaila|Carretero|2011}}
An investigation of the music community of fans of Swedish [[indie music]] showed that they do not gather around one site, but interact with a network of sites including their own fan sites, Myspace, [[Last.fm]], [[YouTube]] and so on.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=143}}

Online discussion forums may provide some of the functions of virtual music communities.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=123}}
However, according to Mary McCarthy a music community should teach uninitiated listeners or musicians, and an online group cannot fill this role.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=123}}
Only a community of real people in a real place can provide the depth of contact, discussion, sharing and support that the novice musician requires for their development.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=124}}

==Community Music Therapy==

Music Therapy is the use of musical instruments, the audio of already made music or the task of improvisational music to either relieve a symptom that involves speech or memory, but one of the newest uses of music therapy using Community music has been in prisons this has helped rehabilitate prisoners mentally of their criminal struggles as well as their mental struggles with anxiety and depression as studied by Dr Christian Gold.

[[Image:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|300px|This 2009 photo shows music production using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
'''Electronic and digital music technology''' is the use of electronic or digital instruments, [[computer]]s, electronic [[effects unit]]s, [[software]] or [[digital audio]] equipment by a [[musician]], [[composer]], [[sound engineer]], [[DJ]] or [[record producer]] to make, perform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=m:tech educational services|title=What is Music Technology?|url=http://www.mtechonline.co.uk/schools/what-is-music-technology.html|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[sound recording|record]] [[music]]. The term usually refers to the use of electronic devices, electronic and digital instruments, [[computer hardware]] and [[computer software]] that is used in the [[performance]], playback, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[musical composition|composition]], [[sound recording and reproduction]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], [[Music informatics|analysis]] and [[Digital audio editor|editing]] of music.

Music technology is connected to both artistic and technological creativity. Musicians and music technology experts are constantly striving to devise new forms of expression through music, and they are physically creating new devices and software to enable them to do so. Although in the 2010s, the term is most commonly used in reference to modern electronic devices and computer software such as [[digital audio workstation]]s and [[Protools]] digital sound recording software, electronic and digital musical technologies have precursors in the [[Music technology (electric)|electric music technologies]] of the early 20th century, such as the electromechanical [[Hammond organ]], which was invented in 1929. In the 2010s, the [[Ontology|ontological]] range of music technology has greatly increased, and it may now be electronic, digital, software-based or indeed even purely conceptual.

==Education==

===Professional training===
{{see also|Audio engineer|Category:Audio engineering schools}}
Music technology is taught at many different educational levels, including college diplomas and university degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level. The study of music technology is usually concerned with the creative use of technology for creating new sounds, performing, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[Programming (music)|programming]] [[Music sequencer|sequencers]] or other music-related electronic devices, and manipulating, mixing and reproducing music. Music technology programs train students for careers in "...sound engineering, computer music, audio-visual production and post-production, mastering, scoring for film and multimedia, audio for [[video games|games]], software development, and multimedia production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology|title=Music Technology - NYU Steinhardt|author=|date=|website=steinhardt.nyu.edu|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those wishing to develop new music technologies often train to become an [[Audio engineers#Research and development|audio engineer working in R&amp;D]].&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;{{cite web|last=wiseGeek|title=What Is Audio Engineering?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-audio-engineering.htm|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increasing role of interdisciplinary work in music technology, individuals developing new music technologies may also have backgrounds or training in [[computer programming]], [[computer hardware]] design, [[acoustics]], [[record producer|record producing]] or other fields.

===Use in music education===
In the 2010s, electronic and digital music technologies are widely used to assist in [[music education]] for training students in high school, college and university music programs. [[Electronic keyboard]] labs are used for cost-effective beginner group piano instruction in colleges and universities.

==History==

[[File:R.A.Moog minimoog 2.jpg|thumb|right|An early [[Minimoog]] synthesizer by R.A. Moog Inc. from 1970.]]
A [[synthesizer]] is an [[electronic musical instrument]] that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through [[instrument amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]]. Synthesizers may either [[#Imitative synthesis|imitate existing sounds]] (instruments, vocal, natural sounds, etc.), or generate new electronic [[timbres]] or sounds that did not exist before. They are often played with an electronic [[musical keyboard]], but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including [[music sequencers]], [[MIDI controller|instrument controllers]], [[#Fingerboard controller|fingerboards]], [[guitar synthesizer]]s, [[wind controller]]s, and [[electronic drum]]s. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called [[sound modules]], and are controlled using a controller device.

Synthesizers use various methods to generate a signal. Among the most popular waveform synthesis techniques are [[subtractive synthesis]], [[additive synthesis]], [[wavetable synthesis]], [[frequency modulation synthesis]], [[phase distortion synthesis]], [[physical modeling synthesis]] and [[sample-based synthesis]]. Other less common synthesis types include [[Subharmonic synthesizer|subharmonic synthesis]], a form of additive synthesis via subharmonics (used by [[Trautonium|mixture trautonium]]), and [[granular synthesis]], sample-based synthesis based on grains of sound, generally resulting in [[soundscape]]s or [[Cloud (music)|clouds]]. In the 2010s, synthesizers are used in many genres of [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[dance music]]. Contemporary [[classical music]] [[composer]]s from the 20th and 21st century write compositions for synthesizer.

The development of the modern synthesizer was spurred on by the invention of the miniaturized [[transistor]] in 1947. The lightweight transistors made it was possible to make [[synthesizer]]s much more portable and complex. A new breed of synthesizers appeared, mainly in [[America]]. American inventor [[Robert Moog]]'s [[synthesizer]] designs in the 1960s were a significant advancement in the field over its predecessors. This was partially owed to new technologies that became available, such as the [[Semiconductors|newly developed semiconductors]]. These new instruments were less expensive and became available worldwide. These were capable of producing a vast range of complex sounds. Later versions often incorporated automatic rhythm units, called [[drum machine]]s. They had more popularity than any synthesizer from the past. The release of [[Wendy Carlos]]' album ''[[Switched-On Bach]]'' in 1968 brought [[Moog synthesizer|Moog's synthesizer]] to the general public's attention. The album demonstrated that besides creating strange sounds, the [[synthesizer]] could be used to make beautiful music.

===Drum machines===
[[File:Yamaha RY30 front.png|thumb|A [[Yamaha]] RY30 Drum Machine]]
A [[drum machine]] is an [[electronic musical instrument]] designed to imitate the [[sound]] of [[drum kit|drum]]s, [[cymbal]]s, other [[percussion instrument]]s, and often [[basslines]]. Drum machines either play back prerecorded samples of drums and cymbals or synthesized re-creations of drum/cymbal sounds in a rhythm and tempo that is programmed by a musician. Drum machines are most commonly associated with [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[house music]], but are also used in many other genres. They are also used when [[session musician|session drummers]] are not available or if the production cannot afford the cost of a professional drummer. In the 2010s, most modern drum machines are [[music sequencer|sequencers]] with a sample playback ([[rompler]]) or [[synthesizer]] component that specializes in the reproduction of drum [[timbre]]s. Though features vary from model to model, many modern drum machines can also produce unique sounds, and allow the user to compose unique [[drum beat]]s and patterns.

Electro-mechanical drum machines were first developed in 1949, with the invention of the [[Chamberlin|Chamberlin Rhythmate]]. Transistorized electronic drum machines later appeared in the 1960s. The [[Ace Tone]] Rhythm Ace, created by [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]], began appearing in [[popular music]] from the late 1960s, followed by drum machines from [[Korg]] and Ikutaro's later [[Roland Corporation]] also appearing in popular music from the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="sos_roland"&gt;{{citation |last=Reid |first=Gordon |year=2004 |title=The History Of Roland Part 1: 1930&amp;ndash;1978 |journal=[[Sound on Sound]] |issue=November |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov04/articles/roland.htm |accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sly and the Family Stone]]'s 1971 album ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'' helped to popularize the sound of early drum machines, along with [[Timmy Thomas]]' 1972 [[R&amp;B]] hit "[[Why Can't We Live Together]]" and [[George McCrae]]'s 1974 [[disco]] hit "[[Rock Your Baby]]" which used early Roland rhythm machines.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;Mike Collins (2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tdEABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320 ''In the Box Music Production: Advanced Tools and Techniques for Pro Tools'', page 320], [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early drum machines sounded drastically different than the drum machines that gained their peak popularity in the 1980s and defined an entire decade of pop music. The most iconic drum machine was the [[Roland TR-808]], widely used in [[hip hop]] and [[dance music]]. Other classic drum machines include the [[Alesis|Alesis HR-16]], [[Korg Mini Pops|Korg Mini Pops 120]], [[E-mu|E-MU SP-12]], [[Elektron (company)|Elektron]] SPS1 Machinedrum, [[Roland CR-78]], [[PAiA Electronics|PAiA]] Programmable Drum Set, [[LinnDrum]], [[Roland TR-909]] and [[Oberheim DMX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felton|first1=David|title=Top Ten Classic Drum Machines|url=http://www.attackmagazine.com/features/top-ten-classic-drum-machines/|website=Attack Magazine|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sampling technology==
{{see also|Sampler (musical instrument)|}}

Digital sampling technology, introduced in the 1980s, has become a staple of [[music production]] in the 2000s. Devices that use [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]], record a sound digitally (often a musical instrument, such as a [[piano]] or [[flute]] being played), and replay it when a key or pad on a controller device (e.g., an [[electronic keyboard]], [[electronic drum]] pad, etc.) is pressed or triggered. Samplers can alter the sound using various [[effects unit|audio effects]] and audio processing. Sampling has its roots in [[France]] with the sound experiments carried out by [[Musique Concrete]] practitioners.

In the 1980s, when the technology was still in its infancy, digital samplers cost tens of thousands of dollars and they were only used by the top [[recording studio]]s and musicians. These were out of the price range of most musicians. Early samplers include the 12-bit [[Toshiba]] [[Technodelic|LMD-649]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[[:nl:Rockin'f|Rockin'f]]'', March 1982, [http://tokyosky.sub.jp/tokyosky_webmasters_blog/2011/02/f-19823-lmd-649-1982.html pages 140-141]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 8-bit [[Emulator I]] in 1981. The latter's successor, the [[Emulator II]] (released in 1984), listed for $8,000.&lt;ref name="Electronic Music Pioneers"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Kettlewell
 | first = Ben
 | author-link = 
 | title = Electronic Music Pioneers
 | publisher = Pro Music Press
 | location = USA
 | date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samplers were released during this period with high price tags, such as the [[Kurzweil Music Systems|K2000]] and [[K2500]].

The first affordable sampler, the [[Akai|AKAI S612]], became available in the mid-1980s and retailed for US$895. Other companies soon released affordable samplers, including the [[Ensoniq Mirage|Mirage Sampler]], [[Oberheim Electronics|Oberheim DPX-1]], and more by [[Korg]], [[Casio]], [[Yamaha]], and [[Roland]]. Some important hardware samplers include the [[Akai|Akai Z4/Z8]], [[Ensoniq ASR-10]], [[Roland Corporation|Roland V-Synth]], [[Casio FZ-1]], [[Kurzweil K250]], [[Akai MPC60]], [[Ensoniq Mirage]], [[Akai S1000]], [[E-mu Emulator]], and [[Fairlight CMI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solida|first1=Scot|title=The 10 most important hardware samplers in history|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/the-10-most-important-hardware-samplers-in-history-361471|website=Music Radar|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest uses of sampling technology was by [[hip-hop music]] [[DJ]]s and performers in the 1980s. Before affordable sampling technology was readily available, DJs
would use a technique pioneered by [[Grandmaster Flash]] to manually repeat certain parts in a song by juggling between two separate turntables. This can be considered as an early precursor of sampling. In turn, this [[turntablism]] technique originates from Jamaican [[dub music]] in the 1960s, and was introduced to American hip hop in the 1970s.

In the 2000s, most professional recording studios use digital technologies. In the 2010s, many samplers exist in the digital-only realm. This new generation of digital samplers are capable of reproducing and manipulating sounds. New genres of music have formed which would be impossible without sampling. Advanced sample libraries have made complete performances of [[orchestra]]l compositions possible that sound similar to a live performance.&lt;ref name="Musical Instruments" /&gt; Modern sound libraries allow musicians to have the ability to use the sounds of almost any instrument in their productions.

==MIDI==
{{see also|MIDI|}}
[[File:Synth rack @ Choking Sun Studio.jpg|thumb|alt=Several rack-mounted synthesizers that share a single controller|MIDI allows multiple instruments to be played from a single controller (often a keyboard, as pictured here), which makes stage setups much more portable. This system fits into a single rack case, but prior to the advent of MIDI. it would have required four separate, heavy full-size keyboard instruments, plus outboard mixing and [[effects unit]]s.]]
[[MIDI]] has been the musical instrument industry standard interface since the 1980s through to the present day.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; It dates back to June 1981, when [[Roland Corporation]] founder [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]] proposed the concept of standardization between different manufacturers' instruments as well as computers, to [[Oberheim Electronics]] founder [[Tom Oberheim]] and [[Sequential Circuits]] president [[Dave Smith (engineer)|Dave Smith]]. In October 1981, Kakehashi, Oberheim and Smith discussed the concept with representatives from [[Yamaha]], [[Korg]] and [[Kawai (company)|Kawai]].&lt;ref name="chadab5100"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chadabe|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Chadabe|date=1 May 2000|title=Part IV: The Seeds of the Future|journal=Electronic Musician|publisher=Penton Media|volume=XVI|issue=5|url=http://www.emusician.com/gear/0769/the-electronic-century-part-iv-the-seeds-of-the-future/145415|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928230435/http://www.emusician.com/gear/0769/the-electronic-century-part-iv-the-seeds-of-the-future/145415|archivedate=28 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the MIDI standard was unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/technical-grammy-award-ikutaro-kakehashi-and-dave-smith|title=Technical GRAMMY Award: Ikutaro Kakehashi And Dave Smith|date=29 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/videos/technical-grammy-award-recipients-ikutaro-kakehashi-and-dave-smith-at-special-merit-awards|title=Ikutaro Kakehashi, Dave Smith: Technical GRAMMY Award Acceptance|date=9 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[NAMM]] show in [[Los Angeles]] of 1983, [[MIDI]] was released. A demonstration at the convention showed two previously incompatible analog [[synthesizer]]s, the [[Sequential Circuits|Prophet 600]] and [[Roland Jupiter-6]], communicating with each other, enabling a player to play one keyboard while getting the output from both of them. This was a massive breakthrough in the 1980s, as it allowed synths to be accurately layered in live shows and studio recordings. MIDI enables different electronic instruments and electronic music devices to communicate with each other and with computers. The advent of MIDI spurred a rapid expansion of the sales and production of electronic instruments and music software.

In 1985, several of the top keyboard manufacturers created the [[MIDI Manufacturers Association|MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA)]]. This newly founded association standardized the MIDI protocol by generating and disseminating all the documents about it. With the development of the MIDI File Format Specification by [[Opcode]], every music software company's [[Music sequencer|MIDI sequencer software]] could read and write each other's files.

Since the 1980s, [[personal computers]] developed and became the ideal system for utilizing the vast potential of [[MIDI]]. This has created a large consumer market for software such as MIDI-equipped [[electronic keyboard]]s, [[Music sequencer|MIDI sequencers]] and [[Digital Audio Workstation]]s. With universal MIDI protocols, electronic keyboards, sequencers, and drum machines can all be connected together.

Some universally accepted varieties of [[Comparison of MIDI editors and sequencers|MIDI software applications]] include music instruction software, MIDI sequencing software, music notation software, [[hard disk]] recording/editing software, patch editor/sound library software, computer-assisted composition software, and [[Software synthesizer|virtual instruments]]. Current developments in computer hardware and specialized software continue to expand MIDI applications.

==Computers in music technology==

Computer and synthesizer technology joining together changed the way music is made, and is one of the fastest changing aspects of music technology today. [[Max Mathews|Dr. Max Matthews]], a telecommunications engineer at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]' Acoustic and Behavioural Research Department, is responsible for some of the first digital music technology in the 50s. [[Max Mathews|Dr. Matthews]] also pioneered a cornerstone of music technology; [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog to digital conversion]].

The first generation of professional commercially available computer music instruments, or [[workstation]]s as some companies later called them, were very sophisticated elaborate systems that cost a great deal of money when they first appeared. They ranged from $25,000 to $200,000.&lt;ref name="Electronic Music Pioneers" /&gt; The two most popular were the [[Fairlight CMI|Fairlight]], and the [[Synclavier]].

It was not until the advent of [[MIDI]] that [[general-purpose computer]]s started to play a role in music production. Following the widespread adoption of MIDI, computer-based [[Comparison of MIDI editors and sequencers|MIDI editors and sequencers]] were developed. MIDI-to-[[CV/Gate]] converters were then used to enable [[analogue synthesizer]]s to be controlled by a MIDI sequencer.&lt;ref name="russ2012"&gt;{{cite book	 | last      = Russ         |first      = Martin	 | year      = 2012	 | title     = Sound Synthesis and Sampling	 | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=X9h5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192	 | publisher = [[CRC Press]]	 | ISBN     = 1136122141	 | page      = 192	 | accessdate = 26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduced prices in [[personal computer]]s caused the masses to turn away from the more expensive [[workstation]]s. Advancements in technology have increased the speed of hardware processing and the capacity of memory units. Software developers write new, more powerful programs for sequencing, recording, notating, and mastering music.

==2000s==
[[Music sequencer]] software, such as [[Pro Tools]], [[Logic Audio]] and many others, are  the most widely used form of contemporary music technology in the 2000s. Such programs allow the user to record acoustic sounds with a [[microphone]], [[audio mixing|mix tracks]] record or [[MIDI]] musical sequences, which may then be organized along a timeline and edited on a [[flat-panel display]] of a [[computer]] or [[Digital Audio Workstation]]. Musical segments recorded on can be copied and duplicated ad infinitum, without any loss of fidelity or added noise (a major contrast from [[analog recording]], in which every copy leads to a loss of fidelity and added noise). Digital music can be edited and processed using a multitude of audio effects. [[Contemporary classical music]] sometimes uses computer-generated sounds, either pre-recorded or generated/manipulated live, in conjunction or [[wikt:juxtaposition]] with classical [[Acoustic music|acoustic instruments]] like the cello or violin. Classical and other notated types of music are frequently written on [[scorewriter]] software.

Many musicians and artists use 'patcher' type programmes, such as [[Pure Data|Pd]], [[Bidule]], [[Max/MSP]], [[Kyma (sound design language)]] and [[Audiomulch]] as well as (or instead of) [[digital audio workstation]]s or sequencers and there are still a significant number of people using more "traditional" software only approaches such as [[CSound]] or the [[Composers Desktop Project]]. Music technology includes many forms of music reproduction. Music and sound technology refer to the use of sound engineering in a commercial, experimental or amateur hobbyist manner. Music technology and sound technology may sometimes be classed as the same thing, but they actually refer to different fields of work. Sound engineering refers primarily to the use of sound technology for [[sound recording]] or in [[sound reinforcement system]]s used in concerts and live shows.

Since the early 2000s, several discussions and conferences have been held, based on how to revamp the Nigerian film industry and bring about more professionalism like it used to be in the golden era. During this time, some other filmmakers, such as [[Tunde Kelani]] and [[Tade Ogidan]] tried to make "break away" films, which were supposedly different from the norm. The now defunct ''Amstel Malta Box Office'' production company also made several films with the aim of making a difference. However, all of these films were also produced in the same video format that the other filmmakers used, albeit with quality stories and better directions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web | url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/nollywood-improves-quality-leaps-to-n1-72trn-revenue-in-2013/#.VFQINRYjQSY | title=Nollywood improves quality, leaps to N1.72trn revenue in 2013 | publisher=Business Day | date=24 December 2013 | accessdate=21 March 2013 | author=Osae-Brown, Funke | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231173754/http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/nollywood-improves-quality-leaps-to-n1-72trn-revenue-in-2013/#.VFQINRYjQSY | archivedate=31 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web | url=http://africamusiclaw.com/nigerias-nollywood-generated-1-72-trillion-naira-revenue-in-2013/ | title=Nigeria's Nollywood Generated 1.72 Trillion Naira Revenue in 2013 | publisher=Africa Music Law | date=30 December 2013 | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Nigerian Cinema finally emerged in the mid-2000s with the release of films such as ''[[Irapada]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Amazing Grace]]'' (2006). ''[[The Figurine]]'' (2009) by [[Kunle Afolayan]] is generally regarded as the break out film, which heightened the media attention towards "''New Nigerian Cinema''" revolution, due to its critical and commercial success in Nigeria, as well as screenings in notable international film festivals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.janethorburn.co.uk/nollywood2DoingItRight.html#pixsmall48adfc | title=NOLLYWOOD 2 Doing It Right | accessdate=18 February 2015 | author=Thorburn, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few years into the 2000s, Nigeria began to experience the growth of cinemas, which was initially structured for the middle and upper class.

==Beginnings==
Since the early 2000s, several discussions and conferences have been held, based on how to revamp the Nigerian film industry and bring about more professionalism like it used to be in the [[Golden Age of Nigerian cinema|1970s]]. During this time, some other filmmakers tried to make "break away" films, which were quite different from the norm; such films include: ''Thunderbolt'' (2001) by [[Tunde Kelani]], ''[[Dangerous Twins]]'' (2004) by Tade Ogidan, ''Madam dearest'' (2005) also by Tade Ogidan and ''[[30 Days (2006 film)|30 Days]]'' by [[Mildred Okwo]] amongst other. The now defunct ''Amstel Malta Box Office'' production company also made several films with the aim of making a difference. However, all of these films were also produced in the same video format that the other filmmakers used, albeit with quality stories and better directions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.ccsu.edu/afstudy/upd11-2.html | title=Editorial: Nigerian Film Industry | publisher=Africa Update Vol. XI, Issue 2 | work=Central Connecticut State University | date=Spring 2004| accessdate=16 July 2014 | author=Emeagwali, Gloria }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web | url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/nollywood-improves-quality-leaps-to-n1-72trn-revenue-in-2013/#.VFQINRYjQSY | title=Nollywood improves quality, leaps to N1.72trn revenue in 2013 | publisher=Business Day | date=24 December 2013 | accessdate=21 March 2013 | author=Osae-Brown, Funke | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231173754/http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/nollywood-improves-quality-leaps-to-n1-72trn-revenue-in-2013/#.VFQINRYjQSY | archivedate=31 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web | url=http://africamusiclaw.com/nigerias-nollywood-generated-1-72-trillion-naira-revenue-in-2013/ | title=Nigeria's Nollywood Generated 1.72 Trillion Naira Revenue in 2013 | publisher=Africa Music Law | date=30 December 2013 | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return of the cinemas==
In the [[Golden Age of Nigerian cinema|Golden Age]], the cinema culture was very vibrant amongst Nigerians. However, the culture started declining towards the late 1980s and the cinema business came crumbling into the 1990s. Few years into the 21st century, Nigeria began to experience the growth of cinemas, which was initially structured for the middle and upper class. [[The Silverbird Group]] is the first company to launch a series of modern Cinema houses across major cities in Nigeria, mostly situated in affluent areas and districts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nificon.org/about/history-of-nollywood/ | title=History of Nollywood | publisher=Nificon | accessdate=15 October 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https:/b.archive.org/web/20130906161318/http://www.nificon.org/about/history-of-nollywood/ | archivedate=6 September 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.modernghana.com/movie/4024/3/gradually-the-cinemas-return-in-nigeria.html | title=Gradually, the cinemas return in Nigeria | publisher=Modern Ghana | date=19 February 2009 | accessdate=17 February 2015 | author=Adelakun, Abimbola}}&lt;/ref&gt; It launched its cinema chains in 2004, starting with the [[Silverbird Galleria]] in [[Victoria Island, Lagos]]. The Silverbird Galleria is a large shopping mall, with an upscale cinema facility and various outlets where mercantile activities take place. This provides more reasons to visit the place beyond just watching films, but more of a social activity and a modified sort of entertainment beyond film watching. This trend has given another probable explanation as to the demise of the Nigerian cinema culture in the 1980s, which might have been as a result of the unfashionable appearance of most cinemas of the Golden era.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;

Silverbird cinemas upon establishment started screening Nigerian films with high production quality, as a result discouraging poor film production; the cinema culture in the Nigerian cities with film theatres started experiencing a significant improvement, and with huge potentials.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt; However, well produced Nigerian films were generally very few at the time;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nigeriafilms.com/news/10861/10/nigerians-and-the-cinema-a-new-love-story.html | title=Nigerians and the cinema: A new love story | publisher=Nigerianfilms.com | date=5 March 2011 | accessdate=20 February 2015 | author= Oogbodo, Oseyiza}}&lt;/ref&gt; even at that, most films screened were produced in [[Yoruba-language]], because they attracted more crowd, compared to a typical English-language film which often had no viewers when screened.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt; The first New wave film to be shown at a cinema was the Yoruba-language film ''[[Irapada]]'' (2006) by [[Kunle Afolayan]], which was screened at the [[Silverbird Galleria]] in Lagos.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

The Silverbird experiment became very successful, and as a result, the group launched few more cinema branches in Lagos and other cities in the country. Not long after the establishment of Silverbird cinemas, Genesis Deluxe Cinemas and Ozone Cinemas were also launched creating a competition in the cinema business.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt; However, the cinemas at start were still very under-patronized, owing to the fact that most of them were established in the upscale areas;&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;{{cite web | url=http://leadership.ng/entertainment/385326/reviving-cinema-culture-nigeria | title=Reviving The Cinema Culture In Nigeria | publisher=Leadership Newspaper | date=27 September 2014 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | author=Abraham, Anthony Ada |author2=Abulude, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It hardly makes sense for people to travel far to indulge in the pleasure of watching films, especially with the attendant problems of traffic and logistics", stated [[Jide Kosoko]], pushing for establishment of theatres in inner neighbourhoods and Local Government Areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt; Much later, in the 2010s, FilmHouse cinemas also came into the picture, leading to more cinemas in the country and availability outside the affluent neighbourhoods.

==''Project Nollywood'' government funds==
In 2006, "Project Nollywood" was launched by the Nigerian Government, in conjunction with [[Ecobank]]. The project provided ₦100 million (US$781,000) to Nigerian filmmakers to produce high quality films. Films produced with this grant include: [[Charles Novia]]'s ''Caught In The Middle'' (2007), [[Chico Ejiro]]'s ''100 Days In The Jungle'' (2007) and Fred Amata's ''[[Letters to a Stranger]]'' (2007), which were all produced using [[digital cinematography]]. Ecobank also funded a multimillion Naira distribution network across the country during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/ecobank-brand-positioning-through-funding-of-nollywood/162681/ | title=Ecobank: Brand Positioning Through Funding of Nollywood | publisher=This Day Live | date=27 October 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2015 | author=Okonkwo, Kasie | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031202719/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/ecobank-brand-positioning-through-funding-of-nollywood/162681 | archivedate=31 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the administration of President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] launched a ₦30 billion (US$200 million) "Creative and Entertainment Industry" Intervention Fund, financed by Bank of Industry (BOI), in conjunction with [[Nigerian Export-Import Bank|Nigerian Export and Import (NEXIM) Bank]]. This grant, although dubbed as a spin-off of "Project Nollywood", was for the entire Nigerian Creative Arts and Entertainment sector. The vision of the grant for the film industry however is to help more Nigerian filmmakers in training, funding, and also help in creating necessary infrastructure for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/concerning-project-nollywood/141676/ | title=Concerning Project Nollywood | publisher=This Day Live | date=10 March 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312051331/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/concerning-project-nollywood/141676 | archivedate=12 March 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://huhuonline.com/index.php/opinions/2210-editorial-concerning-project-nollywood | title=Editorial: Concerning Project Nollywood | publisher=Huhu Online | date=12 September 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major distribution companies established through this loan is FilmHouse Cinemas.

In 2015, [[The Bank of Industry (BOI)|the Bank of Industry (BOI)]] launched another "NollyFund" program for the purpose of giving financial support in form of loans to film producers. A NollyFund Implementation Advisory Group was set up for the program, in order to ensure that only commercially viable scripts with good storylines benefit from the scheme. The group consist of cinema management experts, national film distributors, production and post-production experts, film critics, and film producers; their sole purpose is to critically review all the film scripts and associated budgets submitted to the Bank of Industry by film producers and make "technical recommendations to the management for final credit appraisal and subsequent approval in line with the Bank's Credit Policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thenet.ng/2015/04/bank-of-industry-introduces-nollyfund-for-film-makers/| title=Bank of Industry introduces 'Nollyfund' for film makers | publisher=The NET NG | work=[[Nigerian Entertainment Today]] | date=28 April 2015 | accessdate=6 May 2015 | author=Showemimo, Dayo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201504270114.html | title=Nigeria Launches N1 Billion Special Fund for Nollywood | publisher=allAfrica.com | date=24 April 2015 | accessdate=6 May 2015 | author=Abimboye, Micheal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakout==
The popular 2009 thriller film ''[[The Figurine]]'' is generally  considered the game changer, which heightened the media attention towards "''New Nigerian Cinema''" revolution.

==Production==
Actor [[Wale Ojo]], one of the pioneers and a strong supporter of the ''New Nigerian Cinema'' movement describes the movement as "an elevation of Nigerian film -- high production values, good strong narratives, stories that capture the essence of who we are as Nigerians, as Africans [...] It is a new movement, it's a renaissance, it's a rebirth if you like -- perhaps even a throwback to the [[Golden Age of Nigerian cinema|70s]] but obviously with a very, very modern tint, a very modern glaze to it -- and it's exciting,".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Filmmaker Victor Okhai says: "It is expected that the quality of films will improve. We are at a stage where we can no longer play the mediocre".&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

Unlike the [[Video film era]], films in the new wave are generally of much improved quality, with considerably bigger budgets;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thenationonlineng.net/new/2m-budget-movie-afolayan-hits-location/ | title=$2m-budget movie: Afolayan hits location | publisher=The Nation NG | date=10 August 2013 | accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naijarules.com/xf/index.php?threads/leila-djansi-rush-of-thoughts-on-the-new-nollywood.42916/ | title=Leila Djansi: Rush of thoughts on the 'New Nollywood' | date=11 August 2012 | accessdate=20 March 2015 | author=Djansi, Leila }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; averaging between ₦40 million (US$250,000) and ₦120 million ($750,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/sydneylevine/the_myth_of_nollywood_and_the_rise_of_nigerian_cinema | title=The Myth of Nollywood and the Rise of Nigerian Cinema | publisher=Indie Wire | date=12 January 2011 | accessdate=24 March 2015 | author=Levine, Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2012/11/wakeup-call-kunle-afolayans-phone-swap/ | title=Wakeup call … Kunle Afolayan's Phone Swap | publisher=Daily Independent | date=November 2012 | accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These films' production periods take months and even span into years, a far cry from the films in video format which are usually shot in a matter of days or weeks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25 /&gt; Other notable improvements in the New Nollywood include: more subtle performances from actor, different from the overt melodrama which constituted the video era; more practical; more logical and generally better stories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25 /&gt;

An example of such filmmakers is [[Kunle Afolayan]], who stated that sponsorship could fund about 30&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt; to 50&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; percent of a film's budget.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bellanaija.com/2012/04/19/his-new-movie-phone-swap-beat-hollywood-blockbusters-in-nigerian-cinemas-find-out-how-award-winning-filmmaker-kunle-afolayan-did-it/ | title=His New Movie "Phone Swap" Beat Hollywood Blockbusters in Nigerian Cinemas: Find Out How Award Winning Filmmaker Kunle Afolayan Did It! | publisher=bellanaija.com | date=13 April 2012 | accessdate=20 March 2015 | author=Adeyemo, Adeola}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afolayan in particular has also cultivated the habit of screening his films in public halls and theatres, especially in areas lacking cinemas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; [[Tunde Kelani]] is another notable filmmaker who usually employs this method of distribution.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/4731908/The_Blossoming_of_the_Nigerian_Video_Film_Industry | title=The Blossoming of the Nigerian Video Film Industry | publisher=Academia | accessdate=7 April 2015 | author=Obiaya, Ikechukwu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method filmmakers use in recouping investments is by organizing premium [[Public and private screening|private screening]]s for corporate organizations, as well as entering into deals with [[Pay television|pay-TV]] networks and free-to-air broadcasters across the continent. Online film rights are also acquired by [[Video on demand]] platforms across the continent and beyond.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

Some other filmmakers have also turned the way of targeting foreign developed markets, by featuring foreign cast members – examples: ''[[Black November]]'' (2012) by Jeta Amata, ''[[Doctor Bello]]'' (2013) by Tony Abulu and ''[[Half of a Yellow Sun (film)|Half of a Yellow Sun]]'' (2013) by [[Biyi Bandele]];&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thegrio.com/2012/11/23/hollywood-and-nollywood-actors-unite-in-new-film-dr-bello/ | title=Hollywood and Nollywood actors unite in new film 'Dr. Bello' | publisher=The Grio | date=23 November 2012 | accessdate=24 March 2015 | author=Okpalaoka, Ugonna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/movies/nollywood-seeks-a-hit-with-doctor-bello.html?_r=0 | title=Of Nigeria, but Casting a Wider Net | publisher=The New York Times | date=23 September 2012 | accessdate=24 March 2015 | author=Semple, Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/seeking-a-hollywood-audience-for-a-nollywood-film/?_r=0 | title=Seeking a Hollywood Audience for a Nollywood Film | publisher=The New York Times | date=21 February 2013 | accessdate=24 March 2013 | author=Semple, Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt; this strategy, which initially seemed like the "easy way out" has however been deemed unsustainable, and most of the films in fact were not able to break even in the targeted markets.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ynaija.com/that-thing-around-its-neck-is-half-of-a-yellow-sun-the-biggest-flop-of-2013-ynaija-long-read/ | title=That thing arount its neck: Is 'Half of a Yellow Sun' the biggest flop of 2013? | publisher=[[YNaija]] | date=12 January 2014 | accessdate=24 March 2015 | author=Okiche, Wilfred}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dailypost.ng/2014/02/02/genevieve-nnaji-omotola-jalade-currently-jobless-obi-emelonye/ | title=Genevieve Nnaji and Omotola Jalade are currently jobless" – Obi Emelonye | publisher=DailyPost NG | date=2 February 2014 | accessdate=24 March 2015 | author=Orenuke, Adenuga}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, there have also been talks on establishing low cost and [[Outdoor cinema|open air cinema]]s in neighbourhoods, like there was in the 1970s;&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; none has however materialized as of 2015.

From early years of the New Wave till present day, DVD is considered a "no go" area, due to the prevalent [[Intellectual property|copyright infringement]] in the country. In no time, "New Nollywood" became synonymous with delayed [[DVD]] release, generally taking up to three or four years before release. This is generally because filmmakers intend to maximize profit before releasing on DVD, which is no longer profitable at the moment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Some filmmakers also believed the good films are better restricted to the cinemas, as it's ridiculous to make such outstanding efforts only to make the films disappear into a "mob of useless films" which were still prevalent as of 2012, despite the New Cinema movement. This notion made screening at the cinemas to also become like a criterion for viewers to discern which film to hit or miss. However, unlike in the video film era where many filmmakers were left to the mercy of "industry sharks and pirates" that profited from their creativity, details of sales and [[box office]] returns were now better kept, thereby creating a sort of investor-confidence in the now relatively formal film sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://derinbyday.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/nollywood-2-0-taking-on-the-world/|title=Future Nollywood|journal= The African Courier|date=August–September 2012|accessdate=30 March|pages=42–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright infringement==
Not too long after the New Nigerian Cinema movement was embraced, the malaise of copyright violation quickly caught up with movies made in this era as well. Initially, the films were copied immediately following their DVD releases; examples of films given huge media attention due to infringement include: ''[[Maami]]'' (2011) by Tunde Kelani&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/05/unending-war-against-piracy/ | title=Unending War Against Piracy | publisher=Vanguard Nigeria | date=3 May 2015 | accessdate=30 July 2015 | author=Husseini, Shaibu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Half of a Yellow Sun (film)|Half of a Yellow Sun]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/who-is-to-blame-for-the-piracy-of-half-of-a-yellow-sun-in-nigeria-20140718 | title=Who is To Blame for the Piracy of 'Half of a Yellow Sun' in Nigeria? | publisher=Shadow and Act | work=[[IndieWire]] | date=18 July 2014 | accessdate=30 July 2015 | author=Ekenyerengozi, Michael Chima}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.punchng.com/feature/literary-punch/pirates-feast-on-half-of-a-yellow-sun/ | title=Pirates feast on Half of A Yellow Sun | publisher=Punch NG | date=19 August 2014 | accessdate=30 July 2015| author=Ohai, Chux}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon became a major national concern in 2015, after ''[[October 1 (film)|October 1]]'' (2014) by [[Kunle Afolayan]] was leaked even before it was released on DVD. This turn of events raised several questions on how this was possible, and concerns over the safety of film copies being sent to cinema houses for screening.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/04/in-nigeria-it-is-piracy-incorporated/ | title=In Nigeria, It Is Piracy Incorporated | publisher=Vanguard Nigeria | date=19 April 2015 | accessdate=30 July 2015 | author=Husseini, Shaibu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newtelegraphonline.com/october-1-wake-up-call-for-government-stakeholders-on-piracy/ | title=October 1: Wake-up call for government, stakeholders on piracy | publisher=New Telegraph | date=28 April 2015 | accessdate=30 July 2015 | author=Ameh, Ebere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of copyright violation has been attributed to various factors, which include: poor content management by distributors, who fail to implement the available "anti-piracy strategies and tools", and also laxity from the government.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt; National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) had put in place several policies to curb infringement, many of which had little or no impact. Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) also became active in pursuing infringers, instituting projects such as "Strategic Action Against Piracy (STRAP)".&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt; However, it was reported that the bootleggers, who are mostly located in [[Alaba International Market|Alaba market]], a very congested and disorganized area, have often resisted arrest by law enforcement officials, whom they usually engage in fierce battles by employing all manners of dangerous weapons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt;

The NCC also began the implementation of a new "Copyright Optical Discs Plants Regulations", which gives the NCC administrative and enforcement powers over the production processes of [[optical disc]]s' manufacturers and plants as well as over the importation and exportation of the finished film products. All these measures have however been of little impact, as unauthorized copying remained prevalent,&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt; and NCC itself have been accused of aiding the practice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://naijagists.com/nigerian-copyright-commission-ncc-now-negotiate-with-movie-pirates-kunle-afolayan-says-ncc-supporting-piracy/ | title=Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) now negotiate with movie pirates – Kunle Afolayan | publisher=Naija Gists | date=21 April 2015 | accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still in the bid to fight infringement, Audio-Visual Rights Society (AVRS) was established, headed by [[Mahmood Ali-Balogun]]. AVRS is a [[Collective rights management|Collective Management Organization]] set up to help prevent creative works from being duplicated and overused by unauthorised bodies. It is affiliated to [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) and the Nigeria Film Corporation (NFC) with the sole purpose of overseeing the collection and distribution of the royalties on behalf of the copyright owners in the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/audio-visual-rights-society-debuts/191658/| title=AUDIO VISUAL RIGHTS SOCIETY DEBUTS | publisher=This Day Live | work=This Day Newspaper | date=19 October 2014 | accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the Nigerian Government launched another project tagged "Innovation Distribution Fund (IDF)" under the existing "Project Nollywood" to help protect copyright, by helping to expand and standardize the film distribution system. The fund was targeted at businesses operating or seeking to operate in the film distribution sector; it aimed to co-finance new channels and support the expansion of current distribution system and to help boost the number and quality of distribution options, including technology-based solutions such as digital streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/2015012336908/nigeria-unveils-us-12mn-fund-to-tackle-nollywood-piracy.html#axzz3en7XKDMm | title=Nigeria unveils US$12MN fund to tackle Nollywood piracy | publisher=Rapid TV News | date=23 January 2015 | accessdate=30 July 2015 | author=Hawkes, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, ''[[Business Day (Nigeria)|Business Day]]'' estimated that about ₦7.5 billion (US$46 million) is lost to copyright violation yearly in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web | url=http://businessdayonline.com/2015/06/nollywood-loses-over-n7-5bn-to-piracy-yearly/#.VbhDXfmd8g7 | title=Nollywood loses over N7.5bn to piracy yearly | publisher=Business Day | date=5 June 2015 | accessdate=30 July 2015 | author= Osae-Brown, Funke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is particularly difficult to curb infringement in the Nigerian film industry, majorly because the [[video film era]] was built and sustained on its framework, which ironically eventually became its downfall and has become a major problem in the industry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt; The problem has become almost incorporated into the Nigerian distribution system, as the people involved at this time are mostly unprofessional film people of the [[Video film era|video boom]] period, who are now out of business but still want to retain their wealthy status.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2015/04/october-1-piracywhat-nollywood-telling-jonathan/ | title=October 1 and piracy…what has Nollywood been telling Jonathan? | publisher=Daily Independent | date=18 April 2015 | accessdate=30 July 2015 | author=Akpovi-esade, Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliver &amp; Bonacini Restaurants''' also known as '''O&amp;B''' is a Canadian [[hospitality industry|hospitality]] and entertainment company. Based in [[Toronto]], it was founded in 1993 as a partnership between Peter Oliver and Michael Bonacini when they opened their first collaboration — a restaurant named Jump.

In the years since, the company has expanded and it currently owns multiple venues and properties in and around Toronto. According to a 2013 ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' piece, the company employs a staff of 1,200 people.&lt;ref name="globe-feb-2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Galt|first=Virginia|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/day-to-day/restaurants-need-to-innovate-or-be-eaten/article8736986/|title=Restaurants need to innovate or be eaten|agency=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restaurants==

===Jump===
In operation for more than two decades, Jump is O&amp;B's flagship restaurant. During that time it became a well known business lunch and dinner spot in Toronto's [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]].&lt;ref name="star-nov-2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eastwood|first=Joel|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2013/11/12/jump_bay_street_fixture_celebrates_20_years.html|title=Jump: Bay Street fixture celebrates 20 years|agency=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=12 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it opened at the corner of Bay &amp; Wellington West in late 1993 during the early 1990s recession in Canada, Jump was a major investment by the 44-year-old [[South Africa]]n-born former stockbroker and real estate entrepreneur Peter Oliver who had been an active restaurateur in Toronto since 1978 and 33-year-old Michael Bonacini who had made his name as chef at Centro,&lt;ref name="star-nov-2013"/&gt; a popular Franco Prevedello-owned Italian cuisine fine dining spot at [[Yonge and Eglinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chefdb.com/pl/47/Centro-Toronto Centro Toronto (1987-2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, at the time, Oliver owned successful midtown and uptown Toronto restaurants Oliver's Old Fashioned Bakery and Oliver's Bistro (also in the [[Yonge and Eglinton]] area), Bofinger Brasserie (near Yonge &amp; St. Clair), and Auberge du Pommier (in [[North York]] near Yonge and York Mills); though he opened Jump as a partnership with Bonacini in 1993, Oliver kept the sole ownership of those four restaurants. Their collaboration occurred almost by chance - Oliver had been setting up the Jump project for years before his chef-to-be fell through and he turned to Bonacini who was the executive chef at Centro, across the street from Oliver's Old Fashioned Bakery.&lt;ref name="star-apr-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mintz|first=Coreyl|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2011/04/08/their_gamble_grew_into_an_empire.html|title=Their gamble grew into an empire|agency=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=8 April 2011|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located adjacent to the old glass-covered walkway in [[Commerce Court East]], Jump aimed to bring a New York-style restaurant/bar with an offbeat menu and vibe. Launched with a blowout party with 600 guests and a rock band,&lt;ref name="star-nov-2013"/&gt; the restaurant quickly established itself as the favourite of the business lunch crowd.

In February 2013, ahead of its twentieth anniversary, the restaurant closed down for a month in order to undergo a C$1 million upgrade including the installation of state-of-the-art audio visual equipment to better meet the needs of clients who book space for private business meetings&lt;ref name="globe-feb-2013"/&gt; as well as renovation to the dining room, bar, and kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizbash.com/1-jump-oliver-bonacini-restaurant-jump-celebrated-20th-anniversary/gallery/131972#.VkFl4l74BqA Jump]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canoe===
In 1995, following the quick failure of Chapeau (O&amp;B's first project since Jump took off), the company accepted an offer from the [[Toronto-Dominion Centre|TD Bank Tower]] landlord about opening a restaurant on the building's 54th floor where a struggling vine bar had been operating up to that point.&lt;ref name="star-apr-2011"/&gt; A new restaurant called Canoe opened on 21 September 1995&lt;ref&gt;[http://oliverbonacini.com/OurCompany/Blog/O-B-Blog/September-2015/Canoe-Twenty---20th-Anniversary.aspx O&amp;B blog]&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly turned into another big winner for O&amp;B, by the late 2000s generating between C$6 and 7 million in revenue annually.&lt;ref name="star-apr-2011"/&gt;
In May 2015, nearly 20 years after the restaurant opened its doors, ''The Globe &amp; Mail'''s Chris Nuttall-Smith awarded Canoe four stars, calling the restaurant "fresher, more ambitious, better-polished and more committed today to its cool Canadian mission than ever."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/canoe-canadiana-restaurant-is-still-cresting-the-waves/article24563077/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auberge du Pommier===
[[File:Auberge du Pommier.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Auberge du Pommier in Toronto's [[York Mills]] neighbourhood.]]
Opened in 1987 in [[North York]]'s affluent [[York Mills]] neighbourhood, under Peter Oliver's sole ownership, the fine dining [[French cuisine]] spot Auberge du Pommier operated under his command until 1997 when Oliver's partner in the rising O&amp;B company Michael Bonacini entered into its ownership structure as a co-owner. The restaurant thus after ten years got placed under the O&amp;B banner.

Located in a mid 19th century cottage that was originally built in nearby [[Hoggs Hollow]] before getting relocated to its present location, the restaurant offers refined and modern interpretations of classic French dishes. Its executive chef is Marc St. Jacques who took over the post in 2011 having previously worked under celebrity chef [[Michael Mina]] at his restaurant Michael Mina at [[Bellagio (resort)|Bellagio]] in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nuttall-Smith|first=Chris|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/auberge-du-pommier-seduction-made-safe/article4686787/|title=Auberge du Pommier: Seduction made safe|agency=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=26 October 2012|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">'''Operation G-Sting''', also called Strippergate, and referencing a [[G-String]] part of a costume used by strippers and showgirls.  It was an [[FBI]] investigation into [[bribe]]s and unreported [[campaign contribution]]s taken by [[Clark County Commission]]ers in [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], [[Nevada]] (home of Las Vegas) and [[San Diego city council|city council]] members in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]]. These bribes were from the same [[lobbyist]], representing two sets of strip clubs, and was the result of strip club owners [[Rick Rizzolo]] and Mike Galardi trying to remove local "no touch" laws affecting the girls in their clubs.

A separate [[arms dealing]] investigation was started after the ''Operation G-Sting'' investigation, and ended around the same time.

== History ==
On February 20, 2003, FBI, [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and [[IRS]] agents removed material and documents from the [[Crazy Horse Too]] as part of a lengthy criminal investigation.  As part of that investigation actors [[George Clooney]], [[Robert De Niro]], and [[Joe Pesci]] were interviewed.  The case ended in 2006 when 17 defendants pleaded guilty to various offenses. As a part of the plea bargain Rick Rizzolo was ordered to sell the Crazy Horse Too within one year.

== Political corruption convictions ==
The investigation resulted in the convictions of 17 defendants including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/jane-ann-morrison/politicians-come-and-go-after-serving-corruption-sentences]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9049">In [[literature]], '''pace''', or '''pacing''' is the speed at which a [[narrative|story]] is told—not necessarily the speed at which the story takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1988|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schellhardt|2008|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of words needed to write about a certain event does not depend upon how much time the event takes to happen; it depends upon how important that moment is to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bauer|1992|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pace is determined by the length of the [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], how fast the [[Action (narrative)|action]] moves, and how quickly the reader is provided with information.  It is also sometimes dictated by the [[genre]] of the story:  [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] move faster than [[drama]]s; [[Adventure fiction|action adventures]] move faster than [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schellhardt|2008|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A dragging pace is characteristic of many novels turned down by publishers, and of some that find their way into print but not into the hearts and recommendations of readers.  Most rejected manuscripts move too slowly, encouraging readers to put them down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Methods ==
Storytellers have a number of writing tools at their disposal—for example, [[narration]], action, [[description]], and [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]].  When considering how to pace a story, description and narration will move it along slowly, steadily, and easily, while action and dialogue will speed it up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of all the tools at a writer's disposal, dialogue is the one that most quickly puts the characters and the reader into the present moment, even more so than action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pace can be increased through:
* flipping forward past a scene that is in the story but never appears in the book&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* skipping steps in a logical sequence of events&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* short scenes&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1988|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* frequent paragraphing&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* short sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* action&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* active voice and aggressive verbs&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* flab-cutting (removal of superfluous words and phrases, and unnecessary adjectives and adverbs)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pace can be decreased through:
* description and narration&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* introspection&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1988|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weaving ==
While ''dialogue'' is the element that brings a story and the characters to life on the page, ''action'' creates the movement, and ''narrative'' gives the story its depth and substance.  Writing a story means weaving all the elements of fiction together.  When this is done right, weaving dialogue, action, and narrative can create a beautiful tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pacing is probably the most common fiction element to pay attention to when considering when to and when not to weave dialogue, narrative, and action.  When creating a fast-paced conflict scene between two or more people, a writer might do well to consider only dialogue, at least for parts of it.  Perhaps the characters have just entered into an argument and the writer wants to speed up the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then there are times when a scene should move slowly, so it is not always best to use dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, reading slow-moving dialogue is preferable to reading lengthy passages of philosophical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are scenes in all stories that work best using only narrative or only dialogue or only action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no definite rules about when to and when not to weave.  To weave well is to find the story's rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation ==
===Within a story===
A good [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is an exercise in proper balance.  By staying aware of the scenes' levels of intensity and writing accordingly, a writer can make novels fresh and memorable to their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2004|pp=127-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning writers often give every moment in their stories the same weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bauer|1992|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in writing fiction, they are in charge of the way time moves.  They can pass quickly over what is unimportant, or even skip it entirely.  Then they can stretch out the events their readers care about.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bauer|1992|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a time for telling and a time for showing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most stories are paced not too fast, but too slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, there is nothing less exciting than non-stop excitement, so writers must avoid the monotony of constant action and texture the pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Saville|2013|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing should be done with a consciousness of pacing and tension.  In the [[rising action]] of the story, reader interest can be maintained by upping the action ante with each succeeding scene.  The initial obstacle the hero overcomes should be smaller than the one that follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between different stories===
Different kinds of stories call for different kinds of characters, tension, pacing, themes, and dialogue.  A fast-paced action adventure needs fast-paced dialogue in every scene to keep the story moving forward quickly.  Likewise, a literary story needs the dialogue to match the pace of the other elements in the story—it needs to move more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genre stories generally move quickly, employing more dialogue and action and less slow-paced narrative, because they are generally plot-driven rather than character-driven, like literary and mainstream stories.  The emphasis is on the action that keeps the plot moving rather than the narrative that keeps the character growing.  It pays to know the characters because who they are determines how slowly or quickly they talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Pinewood Derby'''" is the sixth episode of the [[South Park (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 187th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 15, 2009 and in the United Kingdom on April 17, 2009. In the episode, [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] helps [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] cheat in a [[pinewood derby]] race, which inadvertently leads to the discovery of alien life. When an alien gangster visits South Park and the residents come into possession of his stolen "space cash", they decide to keep it for themselves and hide it from alien police officers who are looking for it.

The episode was written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[Television content rating systems|TV-MA L]] in the United States for strong to extreme language. "Pinewood Derby" was seen by 2.78 million households in its original broadcast, according to [[Nielsen ratings]], making it the second most-watched episode on [[Comedy Central]] the week it aired. The episode received mixed reviews upon its initial broadcast.

"Pinewood Derby" has been noted for spoofing a number of world leaders, such as [[Gordon Brown]], [[Silvio Berlusconi]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], [[Raila Odinga]], [[Taro Aso]], [[Han Seung-soo]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], [[Matti Vanhanen]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[Wen Jiabao]] and [[John Howard]]. The episode was originally scheduled to air on [[MTV Latin America]] in February 2010 but was pulled at the last minute, allegedly due to its perceived negative portrayal of [[Mexico|Mexican]] President [[Felipe Calderón]].

==Plot==
Randy Marsh, determined to make sure his son Stan wins the annual statewide [[pinewood derby]], slips an object into the back of the car to give it an advantage. Stan learns from a news report that the object is a [[superconducting magnet]], stolen from the [[Large Hadron Collider]] by Randy disguised as [[Princess Leia]]. During the finals, Randy coaxes Stan to lie to the judges and say he used only the parts in the approved pinewood derby kit. Stan wins first place when his car reaches [[warp speed]], shooting off the track and into space, where it is later found by an alien species. Soon after, a spaceship lands in South Park, but its pilot is a bank robber named "Baby Fark McGee-zax" who demands that Stan and Randy build him a new warp drive while holding the entire planet at gunpoint. Everyone believes Stan and his father can create the drive using only the approved pinewood derby kit.

Stan tries to persuade Randy to tell the truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship approaches Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a [[shiv (weapon)|shank]]. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.

Randy tries to keep other countries from spending the space cash since that might alert the Intergalactic Police; however, this fails when Mexico spends its money on 32 hospitals and 7 water parks, and China spends it on 48 soccer stadiums. Learning that [[Finland]] is about to divulge to the cops, Randy persuades the rest of the world to wipe Finland out in a [[nuclear missile]] attack. The Intergalactic Police pay a third visit to ask about the strike, but the South Park residents fake disbelief. By this time, Stan has had enough of the deception, so he tells the truth about cheating in the pinewood derby and returns his trophy; however, no one else on the planet comes clean about the space cash. McGeezax emerges from the officers' ship, having only faked his death. He reveals that he is really Kevern Zaksor, ambassador to new world testing, and that the entire chain of events was a test to see if Earth was worthy of joining the intergalactic community but humans proven to be too selfish, greedy, chaotic and deceitful. As punishment for failing, the Earth and the Moon are isolated from the rest of the Universe (although it appears to have disappeared [[South Park (season 15)|later on]]). The episode ends with Randy saying, "Well that sucks."

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "Pinewood Derby" was watched by 2.78 million overall households, according to the Nielsen ratings, making it the second most-watched Comedy Central production of the week, behind the [[Ron White]] stand-up special "Behavioral Problems", which was seen by 3.36 million households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cable favorites outside the top 20: From ''Fake Fiance'' to ''The Cougar'' |last=Seidman |first=Robert |date=April 22, 2009 |work=TV by the Numbers |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/04/22/cable-favorites-outside-the-top-20-from-fake-fiance-to-the-cougar/17237#more-17237 |accessdate=April 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u1ho7WLn?url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/04/22/cable-favorites-outside-the-top-20-from-fake-fiance-to-the-cougar/17237 |archivedate=November  6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received mixed reviews. Josh Modell of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said the episode was "boring" and "unfunny", and was particularly disappointing following the episode "[[Fishsticks (South Park)|Fishsticks]]" the previous week. Modell said, "''South Park'' episodes don't get much lazier or uninspired than this one. It was like half an idea stretched out forever and ever, and with very little payoff."&lt;ref name="AVClub"/&gt; Carlos Delgado of ''If Magazine'' said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: "All in all, I was left feeling a little cheated. "Pinewood Derby" wasn’t funny, it was just weird."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Delgado |first=Carlos |title=TV Review: South Park – Season 13 – "Pinewood Derby" |work=If Magazine |date=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said the episode was told with "the warp-speed storytelling style that is making this season one of ''South Park''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s best".&lt;ref name="EWTucker" /&gt; Travis Fickett of [[IGN]] said he was happy to see an episode centered on Randy Marsh, who he said is an excellent character; Fickett said of "Pinewood Derby", "This isn't a great episode but its fast-paced lunacy in the ''South Park'' tradition and most of the genre tropes it riffs on are dead on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Fickett |first=Travis |title=South Park: "Pinewood Derby" Review |date=April 16, 2009 |work=IGN |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/973/973474p1.html |accessdate=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexican flag controversy==
"Pinewood Derby" drew considerable media attention in Mexico when it originally aired due to its depiction of Mexican president Felipe Calderón.&lt;ref name="bbc news"&gt;{{cite news |last=Miglierini |first=Julian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8507514.stm |title=MTV under fire as it pulls South Park episode in Mexico |accessdate=February 10, 2010 |work=BBC News |date=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was scheduled to air in Spanish on [[MTV Latin America]] on February 8, 2010, and was advertised extensively for one week prior to the broadcast date. However, a few hours before the scheduled time, the network decided not to air the episode and replaced it with the episode "[[The Ring (South Park)|The Ring]]", allegedly due to its depiction of Calderón irritating the international community and frivolously spending the space cash on water parks.&lt;ref name="ElUniv0209" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc news" /&gt; This depiction was said to differ from the image Mexico's [[Secretaría de Gobernación|Ministry of the Interior]] sought to present of Calderón, whom they dubbed the "Employment president".&lt;ref name="ElUniv0209" /&gt; MTV said the ''South Park'' creators did not get a special permit needed to broadcast an image of Mexico's flag, and MTV executives said they did not want to risk angering fans by altering the image. The explanation was met with skepticism by Mexican ''South Park'' fans, some of whom accused MTV of unfair censorship.&lt;ref name="bbc news" /&gt; MTV later announced it would broadcast the episode on April 4 after the network was granted permission from the Minister of the Interior to air it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=MTV will air 'South Park' with Mexican president |work=Associated Press |date=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to comment on the episode getting pulled, Stone said, "That's so far away from us. We read that on the news, too, along with everyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |title='South Park' at 200: Trey Parker and Matt Stone Apologize to No One |date=March 10, 2010 |work=The New York Times |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/south-park-at-200-trey-parker-and-matt-stone-apologize-to-no-one/ |accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home release==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1940">A '''redneck joke''' is a joke about [[redneck]]s—working-class, rural or southern white Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |jstor=4140716 |title=Redneck and hillbilly discourse in the writing classroom: Classifying critical pedagogies of whiteness |author=J Beech |journal=College English |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-26tL4shIPkC&amp;pg=PA361 |title=The Oxford handbook of aesthetics |author=Jerrold Levinson |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-927945-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"If you've ever been too drunk to fish, you might be a redneck."
*"If you've ever made change in the offering plate...guilty...you might be a redneck."

==Leagues==
Due to historical accident,{{whom|date=May 2018}} the term "league" in modern roller derby means something more akin to a football club than to a traditional [[sports league]] thus, there are a very large number of leagues sometimes even including two or more based in a single city.

The '''Salt Lick Award''' is an award given to Canadian manufacturers of foods that demonstrate high sodium levels. The name refers to [[salt lick]]s.

== Purpose and History ==

The award is given by the [[Canadian Stroke Network]], the [[Canadian Obesity Network]] and the Advanced Foods and Materials Network. Some of the baby and toddler foods examined by the two groups had no added sodium, while other foods had levels considered excessive.&lt;ref name="CBC News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerber toddler meal too salty: stroke group|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2010/02/02/salt-gerber.html?ref=rss|work=CBCNews Health|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=2 April 2011|date=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salt Lick Award is part of World Salt Awareness Week.&lt;ref name="He2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Feng J.|author2=Katharine H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4447">'''Selecciones Ilustradas''' (sometimes known as ''S.I.'') is a Spanish art agency founded by [[Josep Toutain]].

==Warren Publishing==
Selecciones Ilustradas is probably most well known in America due to its connections with [[Warren Publishing]], where S.I.'s artists drew hundreds of stories between 1971 through 1983. The deal with Warren and S.I. began in 1971 when Toutain met with Warren publisher [[James Warren (publisher)|Jim Warren]].&lt;ref name="WC1"&gt;{{Cite book| year=2001 |author1=Roach, David A. |author2=Jon B. Cooke  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Warren Companion|page=129|publisher=Two Morrows Publishing| ISBN = 978-1-893905-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.I.'s artists began appearing in Warren magazines starting in [[Vampirella]] 11 in May 1971.&lt;ref name="WC2"&gt;{{Cite book| year=2001 |author1=Roach, David A. |author2=Jon B. Cooke  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Warren Companion|page=257|publisher=Two Morrows Publishing| ISBN = 978-1-893905-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1973 S.I. artists provided the majority of the covers and interior stories in Warren's magazines, a dominance that continued until the late 1970s. S.I. artists also contributed to Warren rival [[Skywald]] throughout the early to mid-1970s.

{{Nihongo|'''''Tales of Symphonia'''''|テイルズ オブ シンフォニア|Teiruzu Obu Shinfonia|lead=yes}} is a [[Japanese role-playing game]] released for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] on August 29, 2003 in Japan. It was published by [[Namco]] and is the fifth [[core product]] of the [[Tales (video game series)|''Tales'' series]]. The game was localized and released in North America on July 13, 2004 and in Europe on November 19, 2004.&lt;ref name="NGC dates"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Tales of Symphonia'' Release Dates |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/tales-of-symphonia/related/release/platform/gamecube/ |accessdate=May 2, 2012| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816122206/http://www.gamespot.com/tales-of-symphonia/related/release/platform/gamecube/| archivedate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the game was ported for the [[PlayStation 2]] with additional content and was released on September 22, 2004.&lt;ref name="PS2 date"&gt;{{cite web|title=Symphonia to include Tales of Rebirth preview |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/symphonia-to-include-tales-of-rebirth-preview/1100-6101680/ |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game takes place in a fictional world called Sylvarant and follows [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Lloyd Irving|Lloyd Irving]]. Lloyd accompanies his childhood friend, [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Colette Brunel|Colette Brunel]], who is destined to go on a journey to save their world.

The game's reception was generally positive with critics praising the gameplay but criticizing the plot.

Since its release, ''Tales of Symphonia'' spawned a substantial media franchise in Japan. The game has been adapted into seven [[manga]] collections, two novel series, seven [[Radio drama|drama CDs]], and an [[OVA]] anime series.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Gameplay==
Like previous installments in the [[Tales (video game series)|''Tales'' series]], ''Tales of Symphonia'' consists primarily of three major areas: an [[overworld]] field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen.&lt;ref name="Travel"&gt;{{Cite book| year=2003 | title=''Tales of Symphonia'' North American instruction manual | pages=10–11 | publisher=[[Namco]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world which the player travels through to reach the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on the party's quadrupedal pet [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Noishe|Noishe]], and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments.&lt;ref name="Travel"/&gt; The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.&lt;ref name="Battle"&gt;{{Cite book| year=2003 | title=''Tales of Symphonia'' North American instruction manual | pages=27–34 | publisher=[[Namco]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the overworld and field maps, [[Tales (video game series)#Skits|various skits]] between the characters can be viewed.&lt;ref name="Travel"/&gt; They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and, in the Japanese version, full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. Overworld map skits affect Lloyd's relationships with other party members. The player will be able to make certain decisions that imperceptibly affect how the other characters think of Lloyd. Some of these choices have minor ramifications for the game's storyline.&lt;ref name="Travel"/&gt;

;Battle system
[[File:Tales Of Symphonia - Launch Trailer.webm|left|thumb|Launch trailer with examples of battle gameplay. Critics praised the real-time battle system for being fast and accessible to players.]]
During battle sequences, the game uses the Multi-Line Linear Motion Battle System.&lt;ref name="Battle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2003/08/29/tales-of-symphonia-hands-on |title=Tales of Symphonia Hands-On |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=August 29, 2003 |accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four characters from the [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] are chosen to battle; those not controlled by a player are guided by [[artificial intelligence]] with instructions set by the player beforehand. Damage dealt to the opponent fills a "Unison Gauge". When this is full, a "Unison Attack" can be triggered, allowing the party to use techniques simultaneously on a single enemy. When certain techniques are combined, a special attack results in additional damage.&lt;ref name="Battle"/&gt;

After battle, a currency called Grade is awarded or subtracted based on specific criteria that are fulfilled in battle.&lt;ref name="Battle"/&gt; It is used to purchase bonuses during [[New Game Plus]].

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Tales of Symphonia characters}}
[[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Lloyd Irving|Lloyd Irving]] and his friend, [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Genis Sage|Genis Sage]] accompany the chosen, [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Colette Brunel|Colette Brunel]] and her guardians, [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Raine Sage|Raine Sage]] and [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Kratos Aurion|Kratos Aurion]] on her journey of world regeneration. The purpose of the journey is to replenish Sylvarant with mana, a necessary energy to their survival.&lt;ref group="NGC"&gt;'''Raine:''' Today is the Day of Prophecy. It is a very important day, which the Chosen of Mana will receive an oracle from the Goddess Martel. Now, Chosen One...Colette. Tell us about the journey of world regeneration. /'''Colette:''' It is a journey to seal the Desians. Upon passing the trials of the Goddess Martel, the Summon Spirit that protect the world awaken, and mana is restored.&lt;/ref&gt; The path of the journey consists of five temples which must be unsealed by Colette. On their journey, they meet [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Sheena Fujibayashi|Sheena Fujibayashi]] who comes from Tethe'alla, a world parallel to Sylvarant. She tells them about how the two worlds vie for each other's mana through the journey of regeneration.&lt;ref group="NGC"&gt;'''Sheena:''' My world is called Tethe’alla. [...] The two worlds lie directly adjacent to each other. They just can’t see one another. Our scholars say they exist on shifted dimensions. Anyway, the two worlds can’t see or touch each other, but they do in fact exist next to and affect each other. [...] They vie for the supply of mana. When one world weakens, the mana from that world flows to the other. As a result, one world is always flourishing, and the other waning. Sort of like an hourglass. [...] Sylvarant’s mana is flowing to Tethe'alla. Therefore, Sylvarant is in decline. Without mana, crops won’t grow and magic becomes unusable. If there is no mana, the Summon Spirits that protect the world alongside the Goddess Martel can’t survive in Sylvarant either. As a result, the world slips even further down the path of destruction. /'''Raine:''' Then the Chosen’s world regeneration is actually the process of reversing the mana flow?/'''Sheena:''' Exactly. When the Chosen breaks the seal, the mana flow reverses, and the Summon Spirit that governs the seal awakens.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to find answers from the angel Remiel, the party meets him at the final seal and are betrayed by Remiel and Kratos; both are revealed to be part of [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Cruxis and Desians|Cruxis]], an evil organization led by [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Mithos Yggdrasill|Mithos Yggdrasill]].

The party leaves for Tethe'alla to search for a way to save both worlds and are joined by [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Zelos Wilder|Zelos Wilder]], [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Presea Combatir|Presea Combatir]], and [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Regal Bryant|Regal Bryant]]. The party learns that awakening the Summon Spirits in both worlds will sever the mana tie between them.&lt;ref group="NGC"&gt;'''Undine:''' Mana flows from the world in which the Summon Spirits sleep to the world in which the Summon Spirits are awake. This is the first time the Summon Spirits have been awakened in both worlds at the same time. Because of this, the mana connecting the two worlds has been eliminated.&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that to be the answer, they successfully sever all mana ties between the two worlds.&lt;ref group="NGC"&gt;'''Lloyd:''' Does that mean that Sylvarant and Tethe’alla have stopped competing for each other’s mana?/'''Volt:''' .../'''Raine:'''I do not know. The only thing certain is that the flow of mana between the worlds has been severed./'''Undine:''' Yes. Eventually the worlds shall separate.../'''Genis:''' You mean the two worlds will split apart?/'''Zelos:''' That’s perfect! Then they’ll stop competing for each other’s mana!&lt;/ref&gt; Their actions instead destabilize the Great Seed, the supplier of mana to both worlds, causing it to grow and engulf Sylvarant at an exponential rate.&lt;ref group="NGC"&gt;'''Kratos:''' Having lost the stability afforded by the protection of the Summon Spirits, the Great Seed has gone out of control. /'''Yuan:''' No! The purpose of the Summon Spirits was to isolate the Great Seed from the outside world and prevent it from growing! /'''Kratos:''' That was only half of it. The two worlds were forced out of phase by Yggdrasill. They should have drifted apart from each other and have been consumed by the void. But this was prevented from happening because the Great Seed was placed in the center between the two worlds. [...] The Great Seed is constantly being pulled upon from both worlds as they try to separate from one another. It’s a miracle that this delicate balance held up for even this long. /'''Yuan:''' Wait! So the mana links served as a cage to contain the Great Seed in the space between the two worlds? Is that what you’re saying? /'''Kratos:''' Exactly. And because you provided the unstable Great Seed with mana, germinated in a twisted form and has gone out of control. It’s even engulfed Martel. /'''Lloyd:''' Who cares why this happened! I wanna know what’s gonna happen if we can’t stop this thing!/'''Yuan:''' If what Kratos says is true, then Sylvarant will be consumed and destroyed by the Great Seed. And if Sylvarant is destroyed, Tethe’alla will be destroyed as well, as it is linked by the Holy Ground of Kharlan and the Otherworldly Gate.&lt;/ref&gt; After the party re-stabilizes the seed, they learn from [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Yuan Ka-Fai|Yuan Ka-Fai]] about the origins of Sylvarant and Tethe'alla and how they used to be one world but was split by Mithos with the Eternal Sword; the party realizes they can save the world if they wield the Eternal Sword, merge the worlds, and germinate the Great Seed. They decide to confront and defeat Mithos before seeking the Eternal Sword.

Kratos is revealed to have been gathering materials to have Lloyd use the Eternal Sword. He succeeds but Mithos survives his apparent death and possesses a member from the party&lt;!-- Member depends on game choices --&gt; before fleeing to the comet Derris-Kharlan. Mithos attempts to take the Great Seed with him but is foiled and killed by Lloyd. Using the Eternal Sword, Lloyd merges Sylvarant and Tethe'alla together and germinates the Great Seed into a Giant Kharlan Tree to supply the world with mana.&lt;ref group="NGC"&gt;'''Origin:''' The world was originally separated into two in order to prevent its destruction. If it returns to its true form, the world lacks the mana to support itself. The land is dying. /'''Lloyd:''' I don’t need to know why it’s dying! What do we need to do to stop it?/'''Origin:''' Support the two worlds by linking them with the Giant Tree. That is the only way to stop the destruction of the land. [...] '''Lloyd:''' This is my final wish. Eternal Sword [...] Rise Giant Kharlan Tree!&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scenario===
Takumi Miyajima, the game's writer, explained ''Tales of Symphonia'' was planned to create a "unique symphonia", dependent on the player's choices and the affection system.&lt;ref name="Nov 2013 Viva Tales"&gt;{{cite journal| magazine=Viva Tales of| volume=2013| number=November| date=| publisher=| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyajima wrote many scenarios, with the most significant events centered on [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Zelos Wilder|Zelos Wilder]]. Originally, Zelos' death was supposed to be [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. His survival would have been dependent on the affection system: He would die early on if he was ranked the lowest in the affection system, would die at the end if he ranked in the middle, and would only survive if he ranked the top. However, the development staff suggested to have [[List of Tales of Symphonia characters#Kratos Aurion|Kratos Aurion]] return to the party and the team discussed how it would work. The change in scenario had Miyajima rework Zelos' death into a non-canon path of the story.&lt;ref name="Nov 2013 Viva Tales"/&gt; While generally a self-contained story, ''Symphonia'' apparently takes place within either the same or a similar timeline to the first ''Tales'' game, ''[[Tales of Phantasia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:「テイルズオブシンフォニア イラスト集」 藤島康介のキャラクター仕事|trans-title=Kosuke Fujishima Character Works: Tales of Symphonia Illustrations|publisher=[[Ichijinsha|Studio DNA]]|page=60|isbn=978-4758010191|language=Japanese|date=26 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journey of "The 20 cent Quest" ==

Matthew and Nicholas began by learning to use Flash, and creating characters individually. They then worked out the basic plot of two characters bumping into each other, losing a coin, and then searching for said coin. Their story grew and evolved throughout production. The production didn't happen quickly, it took several terms to complete. In the early days, the animation was very basic, originally viewers had to click on the character's speech bubble each time they said something.

The two learned to use layers effectively, insert sound, [[Inbetweening|motion tweens]], [[morphing]] and became competent in using Macromedia Flash. After going to [[Canberra]] for their grade six camp, they included photos of the War Memorial and Parliament House and then included [[John Howard]] (Who had the letters "PM" on his head which, of course, stands for "Prime Minister"), [[Simon Crean]] and [[Ian Thorpe]] into the animation. The 20 Cent Quest has been shown on local [[Geelong]] television, The [[National Film and Sound Archive]], in Canberra and many other places.

The animation won both K-8 categories of 'Best Junior (K8) Film/Video Production' and the 'Best Student Multimedia Production—Junior (K-8)' at the 2003 ATOM Awards.

'''''The Gladiator''''' is a [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[melodrama]] in five acts written by [[Robert Montgomery Bird]] originally starring [[Edwin Forrest]]. 
It first premiered on September 26, 1831 at the Park Theatre in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne|location=New York|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
This theatrical piece was written at the request of Edwin Forrest, an American actor seeking to further his career. He wanted to solidify his fame by acquiring the rights to perform in plays customized to highlight his talents and physical attributes so he devised a contest to encouraged dramaturgs to author new works in return for a cash price. [[Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags]], a play by [[John Augustus Stone]] won [[Edwin Forrest|Forrest's]] inaugural play prize in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Moody|editor1-first=Richard|title=Dramas from the American Theatre: 1762-1909|date=1966|publisher=World Publishing Company|location=Cleveland|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge success, ''Metamora'' inspired Forrest to continue offering the prize. [[Robert Montgomery Bird]], a doctor without "an all-consuming passion for medicine," hearing of the prize, penned and submitted his first play, the [[blank verse]] tragedy ''Pelopidas, or The Fall of the Polemarchs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Moody|editor1-first=Richard|title=Dramas from the American Theatre: 1762-1909|date=1966|publisher=World Publishing Company|location=Cleveland|pages=230–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Pelopidas'' won the prize, it was not produced or published until 1919, possibly because Pelopidas does not dominate the action of his play in the way Metamora managed and therefore failed to show off Forrest's abilities adequately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foust|first1=Clement E.|title=The life and Dramatic Works of Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1919|publisher=Knickerbocker|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Forrest found it well written and encouraged a second submission by Bird. The following year, Bird won Forrest's prize a second time with that play that would become his most impactful, ''The Gladiator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halline|first1=Allan Gates|title=American Plays|date=1935|publisher=American Book Company|location=New York|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird's brother Henry, in a letter advised Robert to continue with ''The Gladiator'' as [[Spartacus]] was "altogether more suited to Forrest's [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] figure &amp; actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Richards|editor1-first=Jeffrey H.|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it turned out to be the perfect vehicle to showcase Forrest’s “muscular acting style” .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ludot-Vlasak|first1=Ronan|title=Too Much to Perform: Masculinity in Robert Montgomery Bird's The Gladiator and Robert Conrad's Jack Cade|journal=Culture, Society and Masculinities|date=2012|volume=4|issue=1|pages=63–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to ''The Gladiator'', Forrest became “the most famous American actor of his day”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Richards|editor1-first=Jeffrey H.|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

''The Gladiator'' tells the story of a man yearning to live freely and removed from the oppression of totalitarian masters. Spartacus is a gladiator who initially refuses to fight because he will not “slay a man for the diversion of Romans”.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Robert Montgomery|authorlink1=Robert Montgomery Bird|editor1-last=Foust|editor1-first=Clement|title=The Life and Dramatic Works of Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1919|publisher=Knickerbocker|location=New York|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The play opens with Phasarius, a [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[Slavery|slave]] and other [[gladiator]]s decrying the position of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and considering a [[revolt]] against the state left vulnerable by its colonizing and war-mongering generals. However, upon heading from his [[lanista]], Bracchius, that a newly captured Thracian gladiator is an even better fighter than himself, Phasarius resolves to postpone his plans for coup. This newly captured slave is [[Spartacus]], who agrees to battle so that he may free his also captured wife and child.  He barters his services, “I will serve you Better than slave e'er served”, in exchange for his family, “Keep us together”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Robert Montgomery|authorlink1=Robert Montgomery Bird|editor1-last=Foust|editor1-first=Clement|title=The Life and Dramatic Works of Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1919|publisher=Knickerbocker|location=New York|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon meeting each other in the arena of the amphitheater, however, Phasarius and Spartacus recognize each other as brothers, refuse to fight and incite their fellow gladiators to revolt.  They proclaim, “Death to the Roman fiends, that make their mirth Out of the groans of bleeding misery! Ho, slaves, arise! it is your hour to kill! Kill and spare not -For wrath and liberty!-” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Robert Montgomery|authorlink1=Robert Montgomery Bird|editor1-last=Foust|editor1-first=Clement|title=The Life and Dramatic Works of Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1919|publisher=Knickerbocker|location=New York|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} War ensues. The gladiator army, led by Spartacus is initially successful in their crusade against the Romans. However, the two brothers have differing agendas: while Spartacus wants to return with his wife, Senona and son to his beloved Thrace and his live as a [[shepherd]], Phasarius wants to sack Rome. He declares, “Whilst this city stands, This ne'er can be; for just so long our country Remains a Roman province. Tear it down, And you enfranchise Thrace, and half the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Robert Montgomery|authorlink1=Robert Montgomery Bird|editor1-last=Foust|editor1-first=Clement|title=The Life and Dramatic Works of Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1919|publisher=Knickerbocker|location=New York|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phasarius eventually defects from his brother's army when Spartacus forbids his advance on Julia, the captured niece of Crassus, a Roman [[praetor]]. Splintered, the various rebelling armies are easily defeated by the Romans. Phasarius, reconciled and reunited with his brother's dwindling campaign, attempts to escort Senona and her son through a forest to safety. In this attempt, Senona and her child are slain by waiting Roman troops, while Phasarius manages to stumble back to Spartacus and deliver the tragic news before he too dies. Enraged, Spartacus refuses a pardon granted to him by the Romans. In his final bloody fight, Spartacus manages to kill his former captor, Lentulus, before he is felled by multiple Roman troops over the cries of Julia's protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Robert Montgomery|authorlink1=Robert Montgomery Bird|editor1-last=Richards|editor1-first=Jeffrey|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York|pages=173–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it does not have happy ending, ''The Gladiator'' conveys the huge sacrifice man has been willing to withstand throughout history for the sake of freedom.

==Production history==
[[File:Edwin_Forrest_as_Spartacus.jpg|thumb|[[Edwin Forrest|Forrest]] as [[Spartacus]]]]
''The Gladiator'' premiered at [[New York City|New York's]] Park Theatre on September 26, 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalh|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the weather on opening night was poor, the actors in secondary roles of questionable distinction and the sets and costumes "wretchedly bad," the play was a massive success and was received with increasing enthusiasm each of the four nights it played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This original production was noted for the play's climatic Act Two in which Spartacus and Pharsarius refuse to slaughter each other. This scene was staged in a spectacular way, the likes of which had not yet been seen that century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moody|first1=Richard|title=America Takes The Stage: Romanticism in American Drama and Theatre, 1750-1900|date=1955|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After such success in New York, the production moved to [[Philadelphia]], where it was first produced on October 24 and Boston, where the play was seen in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Gladiator'' was such a success for Forrest that he opened with it when he traveled to [[London]] in 1836. Although Forrest was a success at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] on October 17 with ''The Gladiator'', the audience demonstrated their desire to see [[Shakespeare]] as ''The Gladiator'' was seen by many in the audience as anti-British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moody|first1=Richard|title=America Takes the Stage: Romanticism in American Drama and Theatre, 1750-1900|date=1955|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|pages=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halline|first1=Allan Gates|title=American Plays|date=1935|publisher=American Book Company|location=New York|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''The Gladiator'' remained a central part of Forrest's repertoire, as with many pre-[[US Civil War|Civil War]] plays, it eventually fell out of favor as [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] and "realistic representation" became more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moody|first1=Richard|title=America Takes the Stage: Romanticism in American Drama and Theatre, 1750-1900|date=1955|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Bird’s work helped secure Forrest prominence, their partnership ended when Forrest failed to compensate Bird as they had originally agreed. In fact, Forrest’s “poor treatment led Bird to become a novelist”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Howerton|editor1-first=Phillip|title="Robert Montgomery Bird": Writers of the American Renaissance: An A-to-Z Guide|date=2003|publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, CT|pages= 19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the dissolution of their partnership, Forrest produced and starred in ''The Gladiator'' over 1000 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foust|first1=Clement E.|title=The life and Dramatic Works of Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1919|publisher=Knickerbocker|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery in ''The Gladiator''==

The social relevance of ''The Gladiator'' is unquestionable. Spartacus is the “underdog who through thirst for individual freedom and love of family risks all in taking on a tyrannical government”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, 19th century American theater patrons could identify to this as the young country was still figuring out how to live up to the “promises of the Revolution”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the impact reached far beyond the confines of mainstream American theater goers. Dealing with slave insurgency in [[Ancient Rome]], ''The Gladiator'' implicitly attacks the institution of [[Slavery in the United States]] by “transforming the [[Antebellum United States|Antebellum]] into neoclassical rebels”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Peter|title="Slave Revolt and Classical Blackness in ''The Gladiator''" in Rogue Performances: Staging the Underclasses in Early American Theatre Culture|date=2009|publisher=Palsgrave Mcmillan|location=New York, NY|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spartacus was born free just like the first generation of slaves in America and he valued that freedom above anything but family. Unquestionably, the play deals with many of the issues faced by the [[African people|African]] slaves of the time including the inevitable shattering of family units resulting from individual slave sales. Spartacus’ yearning for his wife and son mirrored the plight of many slaves with family members scattered across multiple households or plantations. Although Spartacus finds himself “removed from anything like liberty and dignity”, he manages to rise from the “lowest of the low to become an inspiring role model who comes close to achieving freedom for himself and others”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Martin M|title=Spartacus: Film and History|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Malden, Ma|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robertmontgomerybird.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Montgomery Bird]]]]

[[Robert Montgomery Bird|Bird's]] opinion on [[Slavery in the United States]] is often questioned in regards to ''The Gladiator''. The play was written in a time of great abolitionist activity: [[William Lloyd Garrison]] founded [[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]], an influential anti-slavery newspaper, the same year as Bird wrote his play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halline|first1=Allan Gates|title=American Plays|date=1935|publisher=American Book Company|location=New York|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the timing of the first performance of ''The Gladiator'' was impeccable with it coinciding with the inception of [[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]. It almost seemed to predict the  slave uprising led by Nat Turner in Virginia which resulted in the deaths of many whites until Turner and his men were captured and executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Peter|title=Slave Revolt and Classical Blackness in ''The Gladiator'' in Rogue Performances: Staging the Underclasses in Early American Theatre Culture|date=2009|publisher=Palsgrave Mcmillan|location=New York, NY|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his appraisal of the work, [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] insists that, "this play is as full of 'Abolitionism' as an egg is of meat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Moses|editor1-first=Montrose J.|editor2-last=Brown|editor2-first=John Mason|title=The American Theatre as Seen By Its Critics: 1752-1934|date=1934|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He called ''The Gladiator'' a calculated play to “make the heart of the masses well responsive to all those noble aspirations on behalf of mortal freedom”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clearly, Whitman had no doubt of the play’s abolitionist undertones. Jenna Gibbs states that Bird “used the story to denounce black slavery” and adds that, “Bird noted that his intention was an impassionate and strong dialogue about slavery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbs|first1=Jenna|title=Performing the Temple of Liberty: Slavery, Theater, and Popular Culture in London and Philadelphia|date=2014|publisher=JHU|location=Baltimore|pages=581, 589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards was also convinced of Bird’s anti-slavery agenda stating, “''The Gladiator'' seems intent in reminding audiences that it enacts a slave revolt”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet later scholars have dissented from Whitman's surety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey H.|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some still debate that it is not clear that he intentionally conceived ''The Gladiator'' as an abolitionist play, everyone agrees that he was fully aware of its incendiary potential in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Certainly, Bird did not want his play to be "damned" in the [[Southern US|south]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grimsted|first1=David|title=Melodrama Unveiled: American Theatre and Culture 1800-1850|date=1968|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while Bird himself was worried that, ''The Gladiator'' produced in a [[Slave states|Slave state]] would lead to, "the managers, players, and perhaps myself ... rewarded with the Penitentiary," he also differentiated between "nobel" Thracian rebels and "violent" [[African American]] slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in his journal of the [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner slave rebellion]], Bird remarks, "if they had had a Spartacus among them to organize the half million of Virginia, the hundreds of thousands of the [other] states, and lead them on in the Crusade of Massacre, what a blessed example might they not give the world of the excellence of slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of Bird’s intention, the truth is that the play’s setting could be easily changed from Rome to a Southern plantation without need to modify much else.

==Criticism==

From the very first performance in [[New York City]] the play was a major success, both commercially and critically. Mr.  Forrest’s Spartacus was deemed “the perfection of the art histrionic” and “one of the gems that shone upon the stage”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rees|first1=James|title=The Life of Edwin Forrest With Reminiscences and Personal Recollections|date=1874|publisher=T.B.  Peterson|location=Philadelphia|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst other praise accorded ''The Gladiator'', it was called "the best native tragedy extant," "decidedly the best drama ever written in this century"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Moody|editor1-first=Richard|title=Dramas from the American Theatre: 1762-1909|date=1966|publisher=World Publishing Company|location=Cleveland|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "the stamp of genius in every lineament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prominent [[Philadelphia]] [[critic]], Wemyss called the play, upon its opening in that city, "the perfection of melodramatic tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=Arthur Hobson|title=The Literature of the American People|date=1951|publisher=Irvington Publishers|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was indeed a huge success in Philadelphia as well as Boston and other cities in the [[Northeastern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1966|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Brooklyn Eagle]]'' in late 1846, [[Walt Whitman]] also discusses Forrest's talent, citing the actor as "a deserved favorite with the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Moses|editor1-first=Montrose J|editor2-last=Brown|editor2-first=John Mason|title=The American Theatre as Seen By Its Critics: 1752-1934|date=1934|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the relationship between ''The Gladiator'' and its playwright to slavery is much debated (see above), the play is often seen as the pinnacle of [[romanticism]] in American drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moody|first1=Richard|title=America Takes the Stage: Romanticism in American Drama and Theatre, 1750-1900|date=1955|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written only a few years following the [[First inauguration of Andrew Jackson|inauguration of Andrew Jackson]], the play is [[Anti-imperialism|Anti-imperial]] and [[Anti-British sentiment|anti-British]] where distant [[Colony|colonies]] are persecuted while ancient lineages reign dominant over "the new blood of the poor," a common theme in [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] political rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Gladiator'' played successfully across the country for 70 years. A marker of its enormous success may be seen in how many performances were produced: by 1854, ''The Gladiator'' had been performed over 1000 times, a remarkable feat. It was considered to be the first time a play had reached such a threshold in the playwright's lifetime. Forrest retained the play in his repertoire until his death, and it was eventually taken up by [[John Edward McCullough]] and Robert Downing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Curtis|title=Robert Montgomery Bird|date=1963|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=New York|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

''The Gladiator''’s legacy was a  success from its very first performance. Its theatrical acclaim can be attributed to the appeal of its star, Edwin Forrest, in conjunction with the story of the oppressed seeking freedom from despotism.  The story not only capitalized on  the success of the American Revolution but it fed  from the cultural and societal mood of the time.  By subtly tying the story of Roman slavery to that of [[African American]] slaves, Bird created a framework through which he could express his human equality views. As a result, ''The Gladiator'' became a cornerstone of American dramaturgy awarding Bird his righteous place as one of the most acclaimed playwrights of the early 19th century. Having been performed over 1000 times, ''The Gladiator''’s longevity attests to the universality of its central story touching on themes ranging from freedom and family to the sacrifice sometimes required to achieve societal rather than individual goals.

Not only is the story of ''The Gladiator'' a universally appealing tale, but Forrest’s foresight in having such a play custom fitted to his ability is also an important aspect of the legacy of this work.  In fact, ''The Gladiator’''s "Spartacus was perfectly conceived to meet the actor’s strengths" and completely suited to "Forrest’s Roman figure and actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=Early American Drama|date=1997|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spartacus is "loud, dynamic, and anti-aristocratic" which perfectly suited Forrest’s image. With Forrest talents and physical abilities determining the course of the play, it is one of the first instances where a particular actor’s skills and physique dictate the tone and content of a theatrical offering. Today, theatrical vehicles are often created to fit the needs and desires of many superstars and even up- and comers who are believed to be worth the time and financial investment.

Published during the "Golden Era of the American Stage", ''The Gladiator'' stands as one of the first epics written by an American author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hornblow|first1=Arthur|title=A History of the Theatre in America|date=1919|publisher=Lippincott|location=Philadelphia &amp; London|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a theatrical piece, its impact in the American entertainment industry is irrefutable. Bird’s play, with its critical and financial success, demonstrated the potential of ancient history as fodder for entertainment. It can be considered a precursor to the many works inspired or set during the Roman Empire that are found in contemporary literature and portrayed in the theatre, television shows, and feature films.  For example, Broadway's Her First Roman and Pippin are based on Roman Empire characters though gladiators are not central to the stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henley|first1=Lawrence|title=Pippin: Historically Speaking|url=http://www.bard.org/study-guides/pippin-historically-speaking|website=Utah Shakespeare Festival|publisher=The Professional Theater at Southern Utah University|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gladiators do abound in television and film. Spartacus’ story has been told by at least one long running television series and a 2004 made for TV movie starring [[Goran Visnjic]]. On the big screen, [[Howard Fast]]’s novel Spartacus was adapted into film in 1960 starring [[Kirk Douglas]] and it is considered a classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joshel|first1=Sandra|last2=Malamud|first2=Margaret|last3=McGuire|first3=Donald T|title=Imperial Projections: Ancient Rome in Popular Culture|date=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins UP|location=Baltimore|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawler|first1=Ciaran|title=Ancient Rome on Film:The Best Movies About the Roman Empire|url=Lawler, Ciaran. "Ancient Rome on Film: The Best Movies About the Roman Empire." The  Culture Trip. The Culture Trip Ltd, 13 Dec. 2015. Web. 6 Apr. 2016.|website=The Culture Trip|publisher=The Culture Trip, Ltd|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like Bird’s play, Fast’s novel has social relevance in that it reflects the fight for the “political empowerment of the working class” (Joshel et. al. 91).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joshel|first1=Sandra|last2=Malamud|first2=Margaret|last3=McGuire|first3=Donald T|title=Imperial Projections: Ancient Rome in Popular Culture|date=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins UP|location=Baltimore|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most successful Roman Empire movie is the 2000 film [[Gladiator]] starring [[Russell Crowe]]. Though not directly based on Bird’s work, the influence of ''The Gladiator'' is evident throughout Crowe’s film.  Although the story is different, the heroic central figure, Maximus, is uncannily similar to Spartacus including the yearning for family, his failed attempt at escaping Roman rule, and his untimely sacrificial death. It is important to note that, just like Forrest, the actors in both of the films mentioned had input regarding the content of the films and used them as career building vehicles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">The [[idiom]] '''tongue-in-cheek''' refers to a humorous or sarcastic statement expressed in a mock serious manner.

==History==
The phrase originally expressed contempt, but by 1842 had acquired its modern meaning.&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Contrastive metaphor of Korean and English revealed in 'mouth' and 'tongue' expressions |first=H. | last=Chay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Use Your Body |first =I. G. |last= Zoltan |journal=Philologia |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early users of the phrase include [[Sir Walter Scott]] in his 1828 ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]''.

The physical act of putting one's [[tongue]] into one's [[cheek]] once signified contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=From the Horse's Mouth |first=John |last=Ayto |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8_tRvBSvsC&amp; |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-954379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]],'' which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and on the way, apprehends a [[highwayman]]. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:
{{quote|He looked back and pronounced with a faltering voice, 'O! 'tis very well—damn my blood! I shall find a time.'  I signified my contempt of him by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ld8kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 |title=The adventures of Roderick Random | first=Tobias George |last=Smollett |year=1780}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase appears in 1828 in ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]]: 
{{quote|The fellow who gave this all-hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some [[:wikt:scapegrace|scapegrace]]s like himself.}}

It's not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase.&lt;ref name=owens&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/article/3176644/1196722011 |title='Tongue in cheek' is cut-and-dried phrase|date=4 December 2007 |work=The Oklahoman|first=Gene |last= Owens | quote=... Novelist Sir Walter Scott used 'tongue in cheek' as early as 1828 in 'The Fair Maid of Perth,' but it isn't clear what he meant. |publisher= Phrases.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more modern [[irony|ironic]] sense appears in the 1842 poem "[[The Ingoldsby Legends]]" by the English clergyman [[Richard Barham]], in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:
{{quote|'' 'Superbe!  Magnifique!' '' / (with his tongue in his cheek)&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;}}

The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth&amp;mdash;biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AEL0XOWn0sEC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=The body language phrasebook |first=Nick |last=Marshallsay |publisher= Collins &amp; Brown |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84340-304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*This article contains a section '''flagged for [[WP:MERGE|merge]]''' (See [[#Knockout tournaments|below]]). &lt;small&gt;(October 2015)&lt;/small&gt;
}}

A '''tournament''' is a [[competition]] involving a relatively large number of competitors, all participating in a [[sport]] or [[game]]. More specifically, the term may be used in either of two overlapping senses:
# One or more competitions held at a single venue and concentrated into a relatively short time interval.
# A competition involving a number of matches, each involving a subset of the competitors, with the overall tournament winner determined based on the combined results of these individual matches. These are common in those sports and games where each match must involve a small number of competitors: often precisely two, as in most [[team sport]]s, [[racket sport]]s and [[combat sport]]s, many [[card game]]s and [[board game]]s, and many forms of [[debate|competitive debating]]. Such tournaments allow large numbers to compete against each other in spite of the restriction on numbers in a single match.

These two senses are distinct. All [[golf tournament]]s meet the first definition, but while [[match play]] tournaments meet the second, [[stroke play]] tournaments do not, since there are no distinct matches within the tournament. In contrast, [[football (soccer)|association football]] leagues like the [[Premier League]] are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many stadia over a period of up to a season. Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon tennis championship]]. Tournaments "are temporally demarcated events, participation in which confers levels of status and prestige amongst all participating members"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Alex|last2=Stringfellow|first2=Lindsay|last3=Maclean|first3=Mairi|last4=MacLaren|first4=Andrew|last5=O’Gorman|first5=Kevin|date=2015-03-24|title=Puppets of necessity? Celebritisation in structured reality television|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=31|issue=5–6|pages=478–501|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''tournament-match''' (or '''''tie''''' or '''''fixture''''' or '''''heat''''') may involve multiple game-matches (or '''''rubbers''''' or '''''legs''''') between the competitors. For example, in the [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] tournament, a tie between two nations involves five rubbers between the nations' players. The team that wins the most rubbers wins the tie. In the later rounds of [[UEFA Champions League]] , each fixture is [[two-legged tie|played over two legs]]. The scores of each leg are added, and the team with the higher aggregate score wins the fixture, with [[away goals rule|away goals]] used as a tiebreaker and a [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shoot out]] if away goals cannot determine a winner of the game.

=={{anchor|Knockout}}&lt;!-- [[Knockout tournament]] [[elimination tournament]] redirect here--&gt;Knockout tournaments==
A '''knockout tournament''' or '''elimination tournament''' is divided into successive rounds; each competitor plays in at least one fixture per round. The top-ranked competitors in each fixture progress to the next round. As rounds progress, the number of competitors and fixtures decreases. The final round, usually known as the final or cup final, consists of just one fixture; the winner of which is the overall champion.

In a [[single-elimination tournament]], only the top-ranked competitors in a fixture progress; in 2-competitor games, only the winner progresses. All other competitors are eliminated. This ensures a winner is decided with the minimum number of fixtures. However, most competitors will be eliminated after relatively few matches; a single bad or unlucky performance can nullify many preceding excellent ones.

A [[double-elimination tournament]] may be used in 2-competitor games to allow each competitor a single loss without being eliminated from the tournament. All losers from the main [[bracket (tournament)|bracket]] enter a losers' bracket, the winner of which plays off against the main bracket's winner.

A triple elimination tournament allows a competitor to lose two games, and creates a third bracket or fourth bracket, and are usually followed by a playoff. It is usually used in [[curling]] tournaments. 

Some elimination tournaments are in a [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|best-of-''x'' series]], allowing a competitor to lose at most four times (to the same competitor) before being eliminated.

Some formats use a [[repechage]], allowing losers to play extra rounds before re-entering the main competition in a later round. [[Sport rowing|Rowing]] [[regatta]]s often have repechage rounds for the "fastest losers" from the heats. The winners of these progress, but are at a disadvantage in later rounds owing to the extra effort expended during the repechage.

A [[McIntyre System|family of tournament systems]] that grew from a system devised for the Victorian Football League, the historic predecessor to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), allow the teams with the best record before the playoffs to lose a game without being eliminated, whereas lesser qualifiers are not. Several of the most prominent leagues in Australia use such a system, such as the AFL and the [[National Rugby League]] in rugby league. The [[A-League]] of association football also used such a system through its 2011–12 season, but now uses a pure knockout playoff. Similar systems are used in cricket's [[Indian Premier League]] and most [[curling]] tournaments, and were also used by the [[Super League]] of European rugby league before being scrapped after the 2014 season.

In [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] meetings, fastest losers may progress in a running event held over several rounds; e.g. the qualifiers for a later round might be the first 4 from each of 6 heats, plus the 8 fastest losers from among the remaining runners.

An extreme form of the knockout tournament is the stepladder format where the strongest team (or individual, depending on the sport) is assured of a berth at the final round while the next strongest teams are given byes according to their strength/seeds; for example, in a four team tournament, the fourth and third seed figure in the first round, then the winner goes to the semifinals against the second seed, while the survivor faces the first seed at the final. Four American sports organizations either currently use this format, or have in the past:
* Since the mid-1960s, most [[ten-pin bowling]] events use a stepladder final, usually involving five bowlers.
* Two U.S. college conferences operate a tournament format in basketball that combines two stepladder tournaments into one—that is, both halves of the bracket are organized as stepladder tournaments. When eight teams are involved in the tournament, the bottom four teams play in the first round; the survivors will face the #3 and #4 seeds, and the winners of those matches take on the top two seeds in the semifinals. This format was used by the [[West Coast Conference]] (WCC) for its men's and women's tournaments from 2003 through 2013, and has been used by the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] (OVC) for both sexes since 2011. From 2019 forward, the WCC tournaments will return to the aforementioned format, but add an extra round so that all 10 current conference members will participate (note that the OVC tournament does not involve all of the league's members, currently 12).
* In the Philippines, the [[UAAP Basketball Championship]] and the [[NCAA Basketball Championship (Philippines)|NCAA Basketball Championship]] both use the stepladder format if a team wins all elimination round (regular season) games. This format has been adopted to other sports in both leagues. If no team wins all elimination round games, the playoffs remains in the usual two-round playoff format.
* The now-defunct [[Women's Professional Soccer]] used this format in all of its three seasons of existence. For an example of its playoff system, see [[2009 Women's Professional Soccer Playoffs]].

==Group tournaments==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Division (sport)]] --&gt;
A group tournament, [[League system|league]], [[Division (sport)|division]] or [[conference (sports)|conference]] involves all competitors playing a number of ''fixtures'' (again, a fixture is one name for a tournament-match that determines who, out of two or three or more, will advance; a fixture may consist of one or more game-matches between competitors). Points are awarded for each fixture, with competitors ranked based either on total number of points or average points per fixture. Usually each competitor plays an equal number of fixtures, in which case rankings by total points and by average points are equivalent. The English [[County Championship]] in cricket did not require an equal number of matches prior to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.cricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/CC_HISTORY.html County Championship history] [[Cricinfo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[round-robin tournament]], each competitor plays all the others an equal number of times, once in a single round-robin tournament and twice in a double round-robin tournament. This is often seen as producing the most reliable rankings. However, for large numbers of competitors it may require an unfeasibly large number of rounds. A [[Swiss system tournament]] attempts to determine a winner reliably, based on a smaller number of fixtures. Fixtures are scheduled one round at a time; a competitor will play another who has a similar record in previous rounds of the tournament. This allows the top (and bottom) competitors to be determined with fewer rounds than a round-robin, though the middle rankings are unreliable.

There may be other considerations besides reliability of rankings. In some [[professional sport|professional]] team sports, weaker teams are given an easier slate of fixtures as a form of [[handicapping]]. Sometimes schedules are weighted in favour of [[local derby|local derbies]] or other [[sports rivalry|traditional rivalries]]. For example, NFL teams play two games against each of the other three teams in their division, one game against half of the other twelve teams in their conference, and one game against a quarter of the sixteen teams in the other conference.

American sports are also unusual in providing fixtures between competitors who are, for ranking purposes, in different groups.  Another, systematic, example of this was the [[2006 Women's Rugby World Cup]]: each of the teams in Group A played each of the teams in Group B, with the groups ranked separately based on the results. (Groups C and D intertwined similarly.)  An elaboration of this system is the Mitchell movement in duplicate bridge, discussed [[#Bridge tournaments|below]], where North-South pairs play East-West pairs.

{{main|Group tournament ranking system}}
In 2-competitor games where [[tie (draw)|tie]]s are rare or impossible, competitors are typically ranked by number of wins, with ties counting half; each competitors' listings are usually ordered Wins–Losses(–Ties). Where ties are more common, this may be 2 points for a win and 1 for a tie, which is mathematically equivalent but avoids having too many half-points in the listings. These are usually ordered Wins–Ties–Losses. If there are more than two competitors per fixture, points may be ordinal (for example, 3 for first, 2 for second, 1 for third).

==Multi-stage tournaments==
{{anchor|Group stage}}&lt;!--[[Group stage]] redirects here--&gt;
Many tournaments are held in multiple stages, with the top teams in one stage progressing to the next. American professional team sports have a "regular season" (group tournament) acting as qualification for the "post season" or "[[playoffs]]" (single-elimination tournament). A '''group stage''' (also known as '''pool play''' or the '''pool stage''') is a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] stage in a multi-stage tournament. The competitors are divided into multiple groups, which play separate round-robins in parallel. Measured by a [[Group tournament ranking system|points-based ranking system]], the top competitors in each group qualify for the next stage.  In most editions of the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals tournament, the first round has been a group stage with groups of four teams, the top two qualifying for the "knockout stage" played as a [[single-elimination tournament]]. This format is common in many international team events, such as [[World cup competition|World Cup]]s or [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] tournaments. Some tournaments have two group stages, for example the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] or the [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League]]. As well as a fixed number of qualifiers from each group, some may be determined by comparing between different groups: at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] the best four of six third-place sides qualified; at the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] the best one of five third-place sides did so.

Sometimes, results from an earlier phase are carried over into a later phase. In the [[Cricket World Cup]], the second stage, known as the Super Eight since [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]] and before that the Super Six, features two teams from each of four preliminary groups (previously three teams from two preliminary groups), who do not replay the teams they have already played, but instead reuse the original results in the new league table. Formerly in the [[Swiss Football League]], teams played a double round-robin, at which point they were split into a top "championship" group and a bottom "relegation" group; each played a separate double round-robin, with results of all 32 matches counting for ranking each group. A similar system is also used by the [[Scottish Premiership]] and its historic predecessor, the [[Scottish Premier League]], since 2000. After 33 games, when every club has played every other club three times, the division is split into two halves. Clubs play a further 5 matches, against the teams in their half of the division. This can (and often does) result in the team placed 7th having a higher points total than the team placed 6th (because their final 5 games are considerably easier), nevertheless, a team in the bottom half never receives a higher final ranking than a team which qualified for the top half.

A multi-stage pool system was implemented by [[Curling Canada]] for the Canadian championship curling tournaments (the [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] for women and the [[Tim Hortons Brier]] for men) starting in 2018. The change was intended to allow the expansion of the main stage of the tournament from twelve to sixteen teams while keeping the round robin at eleven games. The teams are seeded using [[CTRS standings|a ranking system]] in which points are calculated based on the teams' results in all competitive [[bonspiel]]s using a complicated formula. Seeds 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16 and placed in Pool A while seeds 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14 and 15 are placed in Pool B. After each team has played seven games, the top four teams from each pool advance to the "Championship Pool." Carrying over their entire round robin records with them, Championship Pool teams play one game against each of the four teams in the opposite pool, with the top four teams qualifying for the [[page playoffs]]. In contrast, teams that fail to qualify for the Championship Pool play only one additional "Placement Round" game against the team that finished in the same position in the opposite pool for the purposes of determining final tournament ranking. For these teams, there is little else to play for since there is no form of relegation (and, with the expansion of the field to sixteen teams, no "Pre-Qualifying Tournament") and seeding is based solely on the performances of the participating teams and not the past results of the provinces and territories they represent.

The [[Premier A Slovenian Basketball League|top Slovenian basketball league]] has a unique system. In its first phase, 12 of the league's 13 clubs compete in a full home-and-away season, with the country's representative in the [[Euroleague]] (an elite pan-European club competition) exempt. The league then splits. The top seven teams are joined by the Euroleague representative for a second home-and-away season, with no results carrying over from the first phase. These eight teams compete for four spots in a final playoff. The bottom five teams play their own home-and-away league, but their previous results ''do'' carry over. These teams are competing to avoid relegation, with the bottom team automatically relegated and the second-from-bottom team forced to play a mini-league with the second- and third-place teams from the second level for a place in the top league.

==Promotion and relegation==
{{main|Promotion and relegation}}
Where the number of competitors is larger than a tournament format permits, there may be multiple tournaments held in parallel, with competitors assigned to a particular tournament based on their ranking. In [[chess]], [[Scrabble]], and many other individual games, many tournaments over one or more years contribute to a player's ranking. However, many team sports involve teams in only one major tournament per year. In European sport, including football, this constitutes the sole ranking for the following season; the top teams from each division of the league are promoted to a higher division, while the bottom teams from a higher division are relegated to a lower one.

This promotion and relegation occurs mainly in league tournaments, but also features in Davis Cup and Fed Cup tennis:
* In the Davis Cup:
** The first-round losers in the top-level World Group compete in playoff ties against the winners of the second-round ties in Group I of the competition's three regional zones, with the winners of each playoff tie remaining in or promoted to the World Group.
** In the three regional zones, Group II is conducted in a knockout format. The winner of the knockout tournament is promoted to Group I of its zone. The first-round losers then play relegation ties, with the losers relegated to Group III.
** Groups III and IV in each zone are contested in a round-robin format. The top two teams in each group are promoted, while the bottom two teams are relegated (assuming there is a lower group in their zone).
* In the Fed Cup:
** The four first-round losers in World Group I compete in playoff ties against the four winners in World Group II, with the winners remaining in or promoted to World Group I.
** The losers in World Group II play ties against the four zonal Group I winners (two from Europe/Africa and one each from Asia/Oceania and Americas), with the winners playing in World Group II the following season.
** Groups I and II in all zones, plus Group III in the Europe/Africa Zone only, are conducted in a round-robin format. The bottom two teams in each group are relegated to the next group down, assuming one exists, while the top two teams in Groups II and III are promoted to the next-higher group.

The hierarchy of divisions may be linear, or tree-like, as with the [[English football league system#Structure|English football league pyramid]].

==Bridge tournaments==
{{main|Duplicate bridge}}
In [[contract bridge]] a "tournament" is a tournament in the first sense above, composed of multiple "events", which are tournaments in the second sense. Some events may be single-elimination, double-elimination, or Swiss style. However, "[[Duplicate bridge#Pairs game|Pair events]]" are the most widespread. In these events, a number of deals (or ''[[board (bridge)|board]]s'') are each played several times by different players. For each such board the score achieved by each North-South (NS) pair is then measured against all the other NS pairs playing the same board. Thus pairs are rewarded for playing the same cards better than others have played them. There is a predetermined schedule of fixtures depending on the number of pairs and boards to be played, to ensure a good mix of opponents, and that no pair plays the same board or the same opponents twice (see [[duplicate bridge movements]]).

==Poker tournaments==
In [[poker tournament]]s, as players are eliminated, the number of tables is gradually reduced, with the remaining players redistributed among the remaining tables. Play continues until one player has won all of the chips in play. Finishing order is determined by the order in which players are eliminated: last player remaining gets 1st place, last player eliminated gets 2nd, previous player eliminated gets 3rd, etc.

In a "shootout" tournament, players do not change tables until every table has been reduced to one player.

==Alternatives to tournament systems==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2015}}

While tournament structures attempt to provide an objective format for determining the best competitor in a game or sport, other methods exist.

;[[Challenge (competition)|Challenge]]{{anchor|Challenge}}: In this format, champions retain their title until they are defeated by an opponent, known as the ''challenger''. This system is used in [[Boxing#Professional boxing|professional boxing]] (see [[lineal championship]]), and the [[World Chess Championship]]. The right to become a contender may be awarded through a tournament, as in chess, or through a ranking system: the ranking systems used by boxing's governing bodies are controversial and opaque. If the champion retires or dies, then the current top challenger may be declared champion or the title may be vacant until a match between two challengers is held. Prior to 1920, the reigning Wimbledon champion received a bye to the final; the official name of the [[FA Cup|FA Challenge Cup]] reflects a similar arrangement which applied only in that tournament's very early years. The [[America's Cup]] is decided between the winners of separate champion and challenger tournaments, respectively for yachts from the country of the reigning champion, and of all other countries. The [[Ranfurly Shield]] in New Zealand rugby union is a challenge trophy between provincial teams, in which the holders of the Shield retain it until they are beaten by a challenging province.

;[[Ladder tournament]]: The ladder is an extension of the challenge system. All competitors are ranked on a "ladder". New contestants join the bottom of the ladder. Any contestant can challenge a competitor ranked slightly higher; if the challenger wins the match (or the challenge is refused) they swap places on the ladder. Ladders are common in internal club competitions in individual sports, like [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[Billiards|pool]]. Another ladder system is to give competitors a certain number of ranking points at the start. If two competitors play each other, then the winner will gain a percentage of the loser's ranking points. In this way competitors that join later will generally start in the middle, since top competitors already have won ranking points and bottom competitors have lost them.

;Selection: A champion may be selected by an authorised or self-appointed group, often after a [[voting|vote]]. While common in non-competitive activities, ranging from [[science fair]]s to [[Film|cinema]]'s [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], this is rarely significant in sports and games. Though unofficial, the polls run by the [[Associated Press]] and others were prestigious titles in [[College football|American college football]] prior to the creation in [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]] of the [[Bowl Championship Series]], a quasi-official national championship (to this day, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] does not officially award [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|a championship]] in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|the top division]] of college football). From [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005]] until the final season of the BCS in [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013]], the [[AP Poll]] operated independently from the BCS, and two other polls were part of the BCS formula. The BCS was replaced by the [[College Football Playoff]], a four-team tournament whose participants are chosen by a selection committee, in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]; since then, all polls have operated independently from the CFP.

'''The Great Trail''', formerly known as '''Trans Canada Trail''', is a cross-Canada system of greenways, waterways and roadways that stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific to the Arctic oceans. The Trail extends over 24,000 kilometres (15,000 miles); it is now the longest recreational, multi-use trail network in the world. The idea for the Trail began in 1992, shortly after the Canada 125 celebrations. Since then it has been supported by donations from individuals, corporations, foundations and all levels of government. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thegreattrail.ca/ |title=The Great Trail |publisher=Trans Canada Trail |accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="annualreport2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegreattrail.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TCT_AnnualReport2016-2017_FINAL_26-28edit_ENGLISH_smaller.pdf |title=Annual Report 2016–17 |publisher=Trans Canada Trail |page=6 |date=2017 |accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trans Canada Trail''' (TCT) is the name of the non-profit group that raises funds for the continued development of the Trail. However, the Trail is owned and operated at the local level. 

On August 26, 2017, TCT celebrated the connection of the Trail with numerous events held throughout Canada. TCT has said it now plans to make the Trail more accessible, replace interim roadways with off-road greenways, add new spurs and loops to the Trail and fund emergency repairs when needed. 

==Origin of trail idea==
The creation of the Trail was born of Canada's 125th anniversary celebrations in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Trans Canada Trail: The 18,000 kilometre dream, second edition, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It has its counterparts in such other [[greenway (landscape)|greenway]] routes as the 12 [[EuroVelo]] routes, the UK's [[National Cycle Network]], and the [[United States Numbered Bicycle Routes]] network.

==Funding==
It has been funded largely by Canadian federal and provincial governments, with significant contributions from corporate and individual donors. The first province to have completed its designated section of the trail was [[Prince Edward Island]] (see [[Confederation Trail]]).

==Development and maintenance==
The network of the Trans Canada Trail is made up of more than 400 community trails. Each trail section is developed, owned and managed locally by Trail groups, conservation authorities and by municipal, provincial and federal governments, for instance in parks such as [[Gatineau Park]] or along existing trails such as the [[Cataraqui Trail]] and [[Voyageur Hiking Trail]]. The Trans Canada Trail supports the construction and use of [[Greenway (landscape)|greenway]]s to replace roadways.

Moreover, considerable parts of the Trail are repurposed defunct rail lines donated to provincial governments by [[Canadian Pacific]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] railbeds rebuilt as [[walking trails]]. As such, much of the Trans Canada Trail development emulated the successful [[Rails-to-Trails]] initiative in the United States, whereby these transportation corridors are "rail banked" as recreational trails, allowing conversion back to rail should future need arise.

Thousands of Canadians, community partner organizations, corporations, local businesses and all levels of government are involved in developing and maintaining these trails. TCT does not own or operate any section of The Great Trail. As an ensemble, The Great Trail might be one of the largest volunteer projects ever undertaken in Canada.

==Routes and amenities==
The main section runs along the southern areas of Canada connecting most of Canada's major cities and most populous areas. There is also a long northern arm which runs through [[Alberta]] to [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] and then up through northern [[British Columbia]] to [[Yukon]].
[[File:Trans Canada Trail in British Columbia.jpg|thumb|This map of the province British Columbia shows the Trans Canada Trail, starting in North Saanich.]]
The Trail is multi-use and depending on the section may allow [[hiking|hikers]], [[bicycle|bicyclists]], horseback riders, [[cross country skiing|cross country skiers]] and [[snowmobile]]rs. In theory, the Trail is equipped with regularly spaced pavilions that provide shelter as well as fresh water to travellers, but this varies widely from section to section, and particularly from province to province.

"[[Mile zero]]" of the Trail is located outside the [[Railway Coastal Museum]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].

== Future developments ==

While the Trail is connected, TCT have said they will continue to fundraise for the future development and enhancement of the Trail. Among its objectives, TCT says it plans to replace interim roadways with off-road greenways, where possible, to make it safer and more accessible for all users, to add new Trail sections, and to provide emergency funding for Trail sections damaged by natural disasters, etc. 

The Trail is not owned or operated by TCT, but the organization provides support to local partners and volunteer groups who maintain individual sections.

===Nova Scotia===

As the trail begins where it is known as '''Pottle Lake to North Sydney''' on the [[Cape Breton Island]] in the town of [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]] separating itself from [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]] after the ferry ride from Newfoundland.  As of June 2014, this portion of the route has not been completed however is planned to travel through the town and crossing [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] following Old Branch Road on the North Side of [[Pottle Lake]].

From here, the trail changes to '''Old Branch Road - George River Division''' continues through [[Georges River, Nova Scotia|Georges River]] and continues south-east touching the north east corner of the [[Scotch Lake (Nova Scotia)|Scotch Lake]] then enters the community of [[Scotch Lake, Nova Scotia|Scotch Lake]] and follows the Scotch Lake Rd.

The route continues as '''Upper Leitches Creek to Scotch Lake''' briefly merging with [[Nova Scotia Route 223|Route 223]] on the Bras D'or Lakes Scenic Drive then follows the Upper Leitches Creek Rd as it enter [[Upper Leitches Creek]].

The route changes to the '''Scotch Lake - Grand Narrows''' trail as it continues now on Tower Rd as it passes the [[MacAulays Lakes]].  The route here will cross [[McLeod Brook (Nova Scotia)|McLeod Brook]] as it passes through the [[Bodale Hills (Nova Scotia)|Bodale Hills]].  The Route changes to '''Little Narrows''' as it enters the community of [[Rear Christmas Island, Nova Scotia|Rear Christmas Island]].

As the route passes [[Bras d'Or Lake|Bras D'or Lake]], it crosses at [[Little Narrows, Nova Scotia|Little Narrows]] using the [[Little Narrows Ferry]] and crosses the Trans-Canada at [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]] in [[Aberdeen, Nova Scotia|Aberdeen]], then continues north through [[Lewis Mountain (Nova Scotia)|Lewis Mountain]] where it becomes the '''Celtic Shores Coast Trail'''.

====Celtic Shores Coast Trail====

The Trans Canada Trail continues passing [[Nova Scotia Route 395|Route 395]] and passing through [[Scotsville, Nova Scotia|Scotsville]] to a fork north of [[Strathlorne, Nova Scotia|Strathlorne]].

'''North Trail'''

The North Path travels north and ends in [[Inverness, Nova Scotia|Inverness]].

'''South Trail'''

After passing through Strathlorne, the route passes [[Loch Ban (Nova Scotia)|Loch Ban]] then [[Black River, Inverness, Nova Scotia|Black River]] where the route changes names to Mabou Rivers Trail.  From here it passes through [[Glendyer, Nova Scotia|Glendyer]] then crosses [[Nova Scotia Route 252|Route 252]] as it passes through [[Rankinville, Nova Scotia|Rankinville]] then crosses [[Nova Scotia Route 19|Route 19]] in [[Mabou, Nova Scotia|Mabou]].

===Prince Edward Island===

Prince Edward Island's portion of The Great Trail is known as the [[Confederation Trail]].  The main trail runs from Tignish at kilometre 0 to Elmira at kilometre 273.  Spurs extend to Charlottetown, Georgetown, Montague, Murray River, Murray Harbour, Souris, Wood Islands, and to the Confederation Bridge in Borden-Carleton which links the Island with New Brunswick on the Canadian mainland.

===New Brunswick===
[[Shogomoc River Pedestrian Bridge]] is a 265-foot [[suspension bridge]] in [[Canterbury, New Brunswick]]. Part of The Great Trail and the [[Sentier NB Trail]] network, it was opened in October 2011 by a ribbon cutting ceremony with Valerie Pringle present as a TCT representative. Sentier NB Trail provided over $300,000 towards the project. It is known as the final non-motorized trail link between the town of [[Grand Bay–Westfield]] and the border of the province of Quebec.

===Quebec===
Much of the Trail's current route follows the ''Route Verte'' and has many cycling routes. Completed off-road hiking trails can be found in Gatineau Park and along a route linking the Papineau-Labelle Nature Reserve, Mont Tremblant Provincial Park, and the Mastigouche Nature Reserve. These form part of a planned hiking route that would eventually link Ottawa-Gatineau on the Ontario border with the Gaspe Peninsula and the New Brunswick border.

===Ontario===
As a legacy project of [[2015 Pan American Games]] and [[2015 Parapan American Games]], the [[Pan Am Path]] helps complete {{convert|250|km|mi}} gaps in Ontario's portion of the Trans Canada Trail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2013/10/ontario-expanding-trails-in-time-for-the-peoples-games.html Pan Am and Parapan Am Trails]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a one-kilometre-long honorary segment of The Great Trail was opened on the grounds of [[Rideau Hall]] in Ottawa. The Lake Huron-North Channel Waterfront route reduces use of shoulders along the Trans-Canada Highway by about 50 kilometres.

===Prairie provinces===

The route through Manitoba is a mix of off-road hiking trails, road shoulders, and waterways.  

Saskatchewan has managed to avoid major highways and paved roads and uses nothing more than rural gravel roads to link off-road hiking trails. The route through this province has been claimed as complete with the opening of the Wakamow Valley Suspension Bridge.  However, parts of the land route include some waterways that require a canoe or small boat.

The off-road sections of the trail are very fragmentary in Alberta, where opposition to the trail by some special interest groups has been very strong.  A major section in Alberta follows highway 2A between Edmonton and Calgary, a road that combines narrow shoulders with heavy traffic.  The main role of the Alberta government so far has been to assist local trail associations in searching for better routes.

===British Columbia===

The main leg of the trail enters British Columbia from Alberta, following the [[Elk River (British Columbia)|Elk River]] passing through [[Sparwood, British Columbia|Sparwood]] and the [[Kootenays]] and Columbia mountains. From there, it delves southward and westward near the [[Kettle River (Columbia River)|Kettle river]]. The trail passes through the [[Okanagan Valley]] over the [[Kettle Valley Rail Trail]], including the very popular [[Myra-Bellevue Provincial Park|Myra Canyon]] portion. From here, it heads through [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]] and continues west to [[Vancouver]]. Vancouver to [[Nanaimo, British Columbia|Nanaimo]] involves a trip on [[BC Ferries]].  From Nanaimo, the trail extends southward as a mix of off-road trails and secondary roadways on [[Vancouver Island]] to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] where another ferry returns to Vancouver.

'''''Wings of War''''' is a [[Flight Simulator]] developed by Czech studio [[Silver Wish Games]] and published by [[Gathering of Developers]]. The game was a standard wartime flight simulator with the underused setting of [[World War I]]. Players assume the role of a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot fighting the [[Luftstreitkräfte]] in several missions. Despite its setting, the game still features an arcade style to it: the planes never stalled {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} and the planes could be equipped with air-to-air rockets.

==Gameplay==
After players created a profile, the game offered numerous options and game play modes including Campaign and Instant Action. During the Campaign mode, players could not only pilot single fighter planes but could also jump into bombers and recon planes as well as inside the seat of tail-mounted machine guns during missions. Players could also fight with rival pilots, partake in bonus missions and collect bonus icons to increase their score although some missions were timed.
