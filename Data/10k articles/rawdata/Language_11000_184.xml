'''Alagwa''' is a [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] language spoken in [[Tanzania]] in the Dodoma region.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Alagwa people|Alagwa]] have shifted to other languages such as [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]].

== Grammar ==

===Word order===
Alagwa sentences have a generalized order [Subject X Auxiliary Y Verb Z], and elements of the sentence other than the subject appear in the positions labelled X, Y, and Z, depending on their information status in the clause.  New material tends to appear in the post-verbal position, Z, while old information appears in the pre-auxiliary position, X.

The following example (Kiessling 2007:138) shows the noun '''yaawáa''' 'dowry' introduced as new information after the verb in the first sentence and repeated as old information before the auxiliary '''ningi''' in the second sentence.

'''Arraignment''' is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant. In response to arraignment, the defendant is expected to enter a plea. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdiction but generally include [[peremptory plea|peremptory]] (setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed), [[Plea#Guilty_and_not_guilty_pleas|not guilty]], guilty, the [[Alford plea|Alford]] (a type of guilty plea where the defendant asserts innocence but concedes that they will be found guilty, only used in the United States) and ''[[nolo contendere]]'' (or no contest).

== Australia ==

In Australia, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[court clerk|clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]]. The judge will testify during the indictment process.

== Canada ==

In every province in Canada except British Columbia, defendants are arraigned on the day of their trial (?).  In British Columbia, arraignment takes places in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer. The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge.

== France ==

In France, the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest.&lt;ref name=fti-france&gt;{{cite web|title=CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND DEFENCE RIGHTS IN FRANCE|publisher=[[Fair Trials International]]|url=http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/France-advice-note.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512213546/http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/France-advice-note.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances, especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year's imprisonment, or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time, and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime.&lt;ref name=fti-france/&gt; The police needs to have the consent of the prosecutor (in the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor will consent).&lt;ref name=fti-france/&gt;

== Germany ==

In Germany, if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest.&lt;ref name=fti-germany&gt;{{cite web|title=CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND DEFENCE RIGHTS IN GERMANY|publisher=[[Fair Trials International]]|url=http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/Germany-advice-note.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512232433/http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/Germany-advice-note.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Zealand ==

At the first appearance, the accused is read the charges and asked for a plea. The available pleas are, guilty, not guilty, and no plea.  No plea allows the defendant to get legal advice on the plea, which must be made on the second appearance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howtolaw.co/facing-criminal-charges-392160&lt;/ref&gt;

== South Africa ==

In South Africa, arraignment is defined as the calling upon the accused to appear, the informing of the accused of the crime charged against him, the demanding of the accused whether he be guilty or not guilty, and the entering of his plea. His plea having been entered he is said to stand arraigned.

== United Kingdom ==

In England, Wales, and [[Northern Ireland]], arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[court clerk|clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]].

In England and Wales, the police cannot legally detain anyone for more than 24 hours without charging them unless an officer with the rank of superintendent (or above) authorises detention for a further 12 hours (36 hours total), or a judge (who will be a magistrate) authorises detention by the police before charge for up to a maximum of 96 hours, but for terrorism-related offences people can be held by the police for up to 28 days before charge.&lt;ref name=fti-england-wales&gt;{{cite web|title=CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND DEFENCE RIGHTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES|publisher=[[Fair Trials International]]|url=http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/Criminal-Proceedings-and-Defence-Rights-in-England-and-Wales-Aug-2013.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222030/http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/Criminal-Proceedings-and-Defence-Rights-in-England-and-Wales-Aug-2013.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they are not released after being charged, they should be brought before a court as soon as practicable.&lt;ref name=fti-england-wales/&gt;

== United States ==

The United States has 57 court systems – one each for [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal]] (1), state (50), commonwealth (2), territorial (3), and federal district (1) jurisdictions.  Each jurisdiction establishes its own rules of criminal procedure.  All 57 sets of rules must comply with certain provisions of the U.S. Constitution (e.g. the privilege against self-incrimination, prohibition of excessive bail, etc.) but otherwise are bound only by their own local constitutions and statutes.

At federal level, the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] provide that "arraignment shall [consist of an] open...reading [of] the [[indictment]]...to the defendant...and call[] on him to plead thereto. He/she shall be given a copy of the indictment...before he/she is called upon to plead."&lt;ref&gt;{{frcrp|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal arraignment takes place in two stages. The first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest, 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Criminal Procedure |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |year=2012 |edition=8th |first=Joel |last=Samaha |isbn=978-0-495-91335-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. The presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set [[bail]]. During the second arraignment, a post-indictment arraignment or PIA, the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.

In New York, most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruling Forces New York to Release Or Arraign Suspects in 24 Hours|first=Kevin|last=Sack|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=27 March 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/27/nyregion/ruling-forces-new-york-to-release-or-arraign-suspects-in-24-hours.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618081518/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/27/nyregion/ruling-forces-new-york-to-release-or-arraign-suspects-in-24-hours.html|archivedate=18 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, arraignments must be conducted without unnecessary delay and, in any event, within 48 hours of arrest, excluding weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name=riverside&gt;[[County of Riverside v. McLaughlin]], 500 U.S. 44 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=California Basic Practice Handbook|date=November 2016|publisher=Regents of the University of California|isbn=9780762624676|page=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an individual arrested without a warrant, in some cases, may be held for as long as 168 hours (7 days) without arraignment or charge.&lt;ref name=riverside/&gt;  For example, both [[Thanksgiving Day (United States)|Thanksgiving]] Day and the day after Thanksgiving are state holidays in California.  So, if someone was arrested at 9:00 am on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, the 48-hour period would not expire at 9:00 am on Thursday as it normally would, because that is a holiday; and the next day is a holiday; and the two days after that are the weekend; so the arraignment need not take place until 9:00 am on Monday morning following the arrest on the previous Tuesday.

In Michigan, the procedure differs for misdemenours and felonies.  A defendant is allowed to enter a plea when arraigned for a misdemeanour but no plea is entered by a defendant charged with a felony.  In either case, the judge explains the defendant's rights to him/her, advises of his/her right to an attorney, sets pre-release bail (except when inappropriate), and sets a date for a pre-trial conference (misdemeanour only) or pre-exam conference (felonies only, and only in some counties).  Because of the Michigan Constitution's guarantee of a speedy arraignment, a least one judge in every Michigan District Court is on 24-hour call every day, including weekends and holidays, so that the arraignment can be held as soon after the arrest as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steps in a Prosecution, Monroe County Prosecuting Attorney|url=http://www.co.monroe.mi.us/officials_and_departments/officials/prosecuting_attorney/steps_in_a_prosecution.php|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009092743/http://www.co.monroe.mi.us/officials_and_departments/officials/prosecuting_attorney/steps_in_a_prosecution.php|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form of the arraignment==
The wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;In some jurisdictions the wording of the arraignment is set by statute or court practice direction.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it generally conforms with the following principles:
# The accused person ([[defendant]]) is addressed by [[name]];
# The [[criminal charge|charge]] against the accused person is read, including the alleged date, time, and place of offense (and sometimes the names of the state's witnesses and the range of punishment for the charge(s)); and,
# The accused person is asked formally how he or she [[plea]]ds.

==Video arraignment==
'''Video arraignment''' is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of [[videoconferencing]] technology. Use of video arraignment system allows the [[court]]s to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the [[courtroom]] by using an [[audio-visual]] link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom.

Use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants. The transportation of defendants requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention. It also addresses the rising costs of transportation.

==Guilty and not-guilty pleas==
If the defendant pleads guilty, an [[Preliminary hearing|evidentiary hearing]] usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the [[mitigating factor]]s, and the defendant's character, and passes [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

If the defendant pleads [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]], a date is set for a [[preliminary hearing]] or a [[trial]].

In the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or "stood mute") was subject to [[peine forte et dure]] ([[Law French]] for "strong and hard punishment"). Today in [[Common law|common-law]] jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea.&lt;ref&gt;In Queensland, Australia, this matter is covered by statute. See s601 of the Queensland [[Criminal Code]].&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for this is the defendant's [[right to silence]].

==Pre-trial release==
This is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail may be made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.

The Asia Spelling Cup draws on primary and secondary school students in various countries in Asia, including [[Malaysia]], Thailand, [[China]] and Indonesia. The 2013 event included Singaporean students.

==The competition==
The Asia Spelling Cup consists of two parts, the Pre-Selection process and the finals

==Pre-selection process==
The pre-selection process is done online and via mobile, using testing software developed and provided by Qooco.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Singapore, Malaysia students top first Asian spelling competition|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2013/10/05/singapore-malaysia-students-top-first-asian-spelling-competition/|accessdate=25 August 2016|publisher=The Star|date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing the [[online]] tests, students are ranked by score, with the top students chosen for the finals. Pre-selection rounds regularly exceed 100,000 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian students won the Asian Spelling Cup in Singapore|url=http://schooladvisor.my/news/malaysian-students-won-the-asian-spelling-cup-in-singapore/|website=School Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finals==
The finals are usually held in a major city in [[Southeast Asia]], in a [[hotel]] conference room or [[resort]].

The Finals are split into two parts, the first part is the [[Primary school]] level competition, and the second part is the [[Secondary school]] level competition.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The '''Association of Green Esperantists''' ({{lang-eo|Asocio de Verduloj Esperantistaj}}, '''AVE''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]] dedicated to using the [[Esperanto]] language, informing [[Green politics|Greens]] about Esperanto, informing [[Esperantists]] about [[Green politics|Green issues]], and translating important documents.

AVE believes that Esperanto should be supported by Greens because it is a language designed to spread peace through international understanding; Esperanto protects the diversity of regional languages against the excessive use of [[imperialistic]] languages; and by using the neutral language Esperanto, Greens can help reduce language [[discrimination]] during their own international meetings.

AVE was founded at the first meeting of the [[European Green Party|European Green Parties]] in 1984 in [[Liège (province)|Liège, Belgium]].

spoken in parts of the [[Indian state]]s of [[Assam]], [[Tripura]] and others, as well as in the [[Sylhet]] region of [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]], and other countries. It uses the Assamese- Bengali alphabet as its  [[writing system]].

==History and development==
Bishnupriya Manipuri is spoken in parts of [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]] in [[India]], in the [[Sylhet]] region of [[Bangladesh]], and in several other countries. It is different from many Indo-Aryan languages like [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], etc. The language originated and developed in [[Manipur]] and was originally confined to the surroundings of the [[Loktak Lake]] and is similar to the [[Assamese language]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mayang, one of the languages spoken in the polyglot state of Manipur, may, however, be classed as a dialect of this language." – Imperial Gazetteer of India, Vol I, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Other authorities such as ''An account of the valley of Manipore'' by [[Col. McCullock]],&lt;ref&gt;"They (Mayangs) amongst themselves speak their own language, which is a dialact of Hindee" – An Account of the Valley of Manipore by McCullock, 1849.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal'' by [[E. T. Dalton]]&lt;ref&gt;"The present population of Manipur includes a tribe called Meiun who speak a language of Sanskrit derivation. They are now in a servile condition performing the duties of grass-cutters to their conquerors." – Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal by T.T. Dalton, 1872, page 48,49.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Linguistic Survey of India'' by Dr. [[George Abraham Grierson|George A. Grierson]]&lt;ref&gt;"A tribe known as Mayang speaks a mongrel form of Assamese known by the same name… They are also known as 'Bishnupuriya Manipuris' or 'Kalisa Manipuris' " – Linguistic Survey of India, 1891. Compiled by Sir [[George Abraham Grierson]], Vol V, page 419.&lt;/ref&gt; mention that the language was in existence in Manipur before the 19th century. Dr. Grierson refers to the language as "Bishnupuriya Manipuri", while some other writers call it simply "Bishnupriya".

The language slowly started losing its ground in Manipur against a vast majority of [[Meiteis]] and is slowly facing its decay in Cachar and Bangladesh against a vast majority of Bengali-speakers. This language is still being spoken in Jiribam (a sub-division of Manipur),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=3..130907.sep07 E-pao.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Cachar (a district of Assam) and in some pockets in Bangladesh and Tripura.

==Source and origin==
The language is known to its speakers as ''Imar Thar'' ({{lang|bpy|ইমার ঠার}}), meaning "Language of my Mother." They call themselves and their language ''Manipuri'',  and use the term ''Bishnupriya'' to distinguish them from other ethnic groups of [[Manipur]]. The term ''Bishnupriya'' is most probably derived from ''[[Bishnupur, Manipur|Bishnupur]]'' along with the suffix ''-iya'', meaning "people of Bishnupur".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. K. P. Sinha. The Bishnupriya Manipuris and Their Language, Assam 1977,page 5,6&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox Bishnupriyas hold that the language was carried over to bishnupriya Manipuri by some immigrants from [[Dvārakā]] and [[Hastinapura]] just after the [[Mahabharata]] war. It is further said that these immigrants were led by [[Babhruvahana]], the son of [[Chitrāngadā|Chitrangada]] and [[Arjuna]], the third Pandava. Some scholars and history writers came to support the [[Mahabharata Theory of Bishnupriya Language|Mahabharata origin of Bishnupriya Manipuri]] from observation of the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], the [[vocables]], and the [[phonology]] of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language.&lt;ref&gt;Singha, Jagat Mohan &amp; Singha, Birendra. The Bishnupriya Manipuris &amp; Their Language. [[Silchar]], 1976&lt;/ref&gt; They hold that BPM is highly influenced by [[Sanskrit]] and [[Maharastri]] as well as Sauraseni [[Prakrit]]s. [[Dr. KP Sinha]], who has done considerable research on Bishnupriya Manipuri, disagrees with the theory and is of the opinion that the language was originated through [[Magadhi]] Prakrita. It is found from his observations that the language has retained dominant characteristics of Magadhi. According to Dr Sinha, pronouns and declensional and conjugational endings seem to be same as or closely related to those of [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. These forms of Oriya, Bengali are, on their parts, derived from Magadhi Apabhramsa coming from the Magadhi Prakrita.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. KP Sinha, An Etymological Dictionary of Bishnupriya Manipuri,Silchar, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Bishnupriya Manipuri language is certainly not one of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], but is closer to the Indo-Aryan group of languages with remarkable influence from [[Meitei language|Meitei]] both grammatically and phonetically. At a different stage of development of the language the Sauraseni, Maharashtri and Magadhi languages and the Tibeto-Burman languages exerted influence on it as well. So it was probably developed from Sanskrit, [[Sauraseni]]-[[Maharashtri]] [[Prakrit]] and [[Magadhi]] Prakrita.The Sauraseni-Maharastri relation can be traced by observing some characteristics of pronouns. The Magadhi element is also remarkable, as the language retains many characteristics of Magadhi. It can further be noted that Bishnupriya Manipuri retains much of the old (15th century to 17th century A.D.) Meitei sound vocabulary, as the majority of speakers of the language left Manipur during the first part of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tribals and their Culture in Manipur and Nagaland by G. K. Ghose. Page 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Bishnupriya Manipuri have two dialects, namely Rajar Gang ("King's village") and Madai Gang ("Queen's village"). Unlike the dialects of other tribes, these dialects of Bishnupriya are not confined to distinct geographical areas. In Manipur, however, these two dialects were confined to well-defined territories. From the viewpoint of phonetics, Madai Gang is more akin to Assamese and Meitei, whereas Rajar Gang is more akin to Bengali. In vocabulary Madai Gang is more influenced by Meitei and Assamese while Rajar Gang is more akin to Bengali. The morphological differences between the two dialects are negligible.

==Vocabulary==
Like other Indic languages, the core vocabulary of Bishnupriya Manipuri is made up of ''tadbhava'' words (i.e. words inherited over time from older Indic languages, including Sanskrit, including many historical changes in grammar and pronunciation), although thousands of ''tatsama'' words (i.e. words that were re-borrowed directly from Sanskrit with little phonetic or grammatical change) augment the vocabulary greatly. In addition, many other words were borrowed from languages spoken in the region either natively or as a colonial language, including Meitei, English, and Perso-Arabic.

*Inherited/native Indic words (''tadbhava''): 10,000 (Of these, 2,000 are only found in Bishnupriya Manipuri, and have not been inherited by other Indic languages)
*Words re-borrowed from Sanskrit (''tatsama''): 10,000
*Words re-borrowed from Sanskrit, partially modified (''ardhatatsama''): 1,500
*Words borrowed from Meitei: 3,500
*Words borrowed from other indigenous non-Indic languages (''desi''): 1,500
*Words borrowed from Perso-Arabic: 2,000
*Words borrowed from English: 700
*Hybrid words: 1,000
*Words of obscure origin: 1,300

==Meitei elements in Bishnupriya Manipuri==
Bishnupriya Manipuri retains the old eighteen sounds of Meitei. Of them, there were three vowels, such as ''ɑ'', ''i'' and ''u'', thirteen consonants such as p, t, k, pʰ, tʰ, kʰ, c͡ʃ, m, n, ŋ, l, ʃ, h and two semi vowels, such as ''w'' and ''j''. In later stage nine more sounds added to Meitei but Bishnupriya is not concerned with them, because the Bishnupriyas left Manipur during 1st part of 19th century. That is why Bishnupriya Manipuri retains the older sounds of Meitei, whereas in Meitei itself the sound system has under-gone various changes.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. K.P. Sinha, The Bishnupriya Manipuri Language, Calcutta, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
The most distinctive influence of Maitei language over Bishnupriya manipuri is formation of words starting with vowel soung {{lang|bpy|ঙ}} 'aung' such as {{lang|bpy|ঙা}}, {{lang|bpy|ঙৌবা}}, {{lang|bpy|ঙারল}}.

==Connection with Assamese language==
Although there are numerous dissimilarities between Assamese and BPM, Dr. [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]], a recognized Bengali phonetician, listed the BPM language to be a dialect of Bengali, whereas Dr. Maheswer Neog and Dr. Banikanta Kakti claimed it as a dialect of indigenous Assamese. Their assumptions later caused contradiction about the origin of Bishnupriya Manipuri language. But the assumptions were proven incorrect by scientific research and observation of morphology, vocabulary and phonology of BPM.

==Script==
The orthodox Bishnupriyas claim that they have their own script, that is, the [[Devanagari]] script, which was used to write in the Bishnupriya language in its early years.

However, on introduction of modern education during the British period through the Bengali language the Bishnupriya Manipuri writers began to use the [[Eastern Nagari|Purvanagari]] i.e. Assamese-Bengali script. This alphabet has consonant letters with dependent vowel signs (matras) as well as independent vowel letters. Punctuation marks and numerals are also used. Bishnupriya Manipuri is written from left to right and top to bottom, in the same manner as in English. Some of the consonants can combine with one another to make orthographic clusters (named conjuncts).

==Speakers==
=== Distribution ===
In [[Manipur]] the language is still spoken in the [[Jiribam]] subdivision. A large number of Bishnupriya Manipuri people settled in Assam ages ago, particularly in the districts of [[Cachar]], [[Karimganj]], [[Dullabcherra]], [[Patherkandi]] and [[Hailakandi]]. These people are counted as one of the major groups of people in the Cachar and Karimganj districts. In [[Tripura]], the Bishnupriya Manipuri population localities may be divided into a Dharmanagar sub-area, a Kailasahar sub-area, a Kamalpur sub-area and a West Tripura sub-area. In [[Meghalaya]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Mizoram]], there is a scattered Bishnupriya Manipuri population.

Outside of India, Bangladesh has the largest Bishnupriya Manipuri population. The main localities are Sylhet, Moulbivazar, Habiganj and the Sunamganj district. As per records, there were also a considerable number of the Bishnupriyas Manipuris living in local cities like Mymensingh, Rangamati of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and also at Tezgaon, Manipuri-para in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh.

In Burma the Bishnupriya Manipuri areas are probably Mandalay, Amarpura etc. In case of the United States of America, Canada, Germany, Middle East and Austria, there are a considerable number of Bishnupriya Manipuris settled there.

==Literature==

===Ancient literature===
A good stock of folk literatures of Bishnupriya Manipuri, which are older in origin, are  handed down to this day through [[oral tradition]]. The ancient literature of Bishnupriya Manipuri is represented by folk stories, folk-songs, folk-poems, rhymes and proverbs. A rain-invoking song called ''Boron-dahanir Ela'' ({{lang|bpy|বরন ডাহানির এলা}}, 1450–1600 A.D.&lt;ref&gt; [http://manipuri.itgo.com/archives/boron_dahanir_ela.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) and a song relating to the conjugal life of Madai and Soralel known as ''Madai Soralel Ela'' ({{lang|bpy|মাদই সরারেলর এলা}}, 1500–1600 [http://manipuri.itgo.com/archives/madoi_soralel_ela.html]) are sometimes considered the most important. The language of the songs are archaic and are replete with words of Tibeto-Burman origin. These two songs are very important for the study of the cultural and linguistic history of Bishnupriya Manipuri. Besides these, there are songs which are sung by women who work in the fields. Proverbs form another important part of BPM folk literature.

===Modern literature===
The Bishnupriya Manipuris have established the apex literary organization of the community  Nikhil Bishnupriya Manipuri Sahitya Parishad (1955), Bishnupriya Manipuri Sahitya Sabha, Bishnupriya Manipuri Sahitya Singlup, Pouri, Manipuri Theatre and many other organizations to encourage literary activities among the people. Serious literary culture of the BPM language began during the 2nd quarter of 20th century. In fact, the history of Manipuri literature began in 1925 with the literary magazine ''Jagaran'' ({{lang|bpy|জাগরন}}) edited by Falguni Singha who was a Bishnupriya Social worker; this magazine published articles both in Bishnupriya and Meitei. The Manipuris of Surma valley formed their first formal association, Surma Valley Manipuri Society (later called Surma Valley Manipuri Association) in 1934. The members included the Meiteis, the Bishnupriyas and the [[Pangals]] (Manipuri Muslims). From 1933 a number of journals, e.g. ''Manipuri'' (1933), ''Mekhali'' (1938) and ''Kshatryajyoti'' (1944), fostered nationalism as well literary and cultural activities. A branch of modern BPM poetic literature, namely [[Vaishnava]] [[Padavali]], based on Vaishnava philosophy, deserves special mention.

==Bishnupriya Manipuri Wikipedia==
There is a Wikipedia in [http://bpy.wikipedia.org Bishnupriya Manipuri] with {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|bpy|N}} articles as of {{TODAY}}. This makes it a little under half the size of the [[Bengali Wikipedia]], and more than five times larger than the next-largest [[Eastern Nagari script|Eastern Nagari]]-script Wikipedia, [[Assamese Wikipedia|Assamese]].

[[File:Locutorio Telefónica Rosario.jpg|thumb|Call shop in Argentina|alt=Outside of store for making telephone calls]]
A '''call shop''' is a business providing on-site access to [[telephone]]s for long-distance calling in countries without widespread home long-distance service. Calls may be prepaid or postpaid.

==Payment methods==
=== Prepaid ===
A customer visits the call shop, and pays the operator for the call. The operator then activates a phone booth for the customer with billing software. The customer then goes to the phone booth and dials the destination number. The billing software records the call details and corresponding charges for future reference.

===Postpaid===
Postpaid calling operates in a similar manner, except that when the customer has completed their call(s) the call-shop operator generates an invoice.

'''Danwar''' (also rendered ''Danuwar'', ''Denwar'', ''Dhanvar'', ''Dhanwar''), is a language spoken in parts of [[Nepal]] by an [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] ethnic group of fifty thousand. It is close to [[Bote-Darai language|Bote-Darai]] but otherwise unclassified within the [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. 

A variety called Danwar Rai is distinct and may be a separate language. It is not related to the [[Rai languages]] of the Tibeto-Burman family.

Capacities of [[wine]] casks were formerly measured and standardised according to a specific system of [[English units]].  The various units were historically defined in terms of the [[wine gallon]] so varied according to the definition of the gallon until the adoption of the [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] wine gallon in 1707. In the United Kingdom and its colonies the units were redefined with the introduction of the [[imperial units|imperial system]] whilst the Queen Anne wine gallon was adopted as the standard [[United States customary units|US]] liquid [[gallon]].

The major wine producing countries use barrels extensively and have developed standards at variance with the traditional English volumes are commonly used in the wine and wine [[Cooper (profession)|cooperage]] industries.{{clarify|date=March 2018}} Examples include a [[hogshead]] of {{convert|300|L|impgal USgal|abbr=on}}, a [[barrique]] of {{convert|220|L|impgal USgal|abbr=on}} (Bordeaux), a barrel of {{convert|225|L|impgal USgal|abbr=on}} (Australia), a barrel of {{convert|230|L|impgal USgal|abbr=on}} (Burgundy) and a [[Puncheon (barrel)|puncheon]] of {{convert|465|L|impgal USgal|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apjohn.com.au/Upload/PrintPages/AP%20John_Technical_Specifications.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Tun
The tun ({{lang-ang|tunne}}, {{lang-la|tunellus}}, [[Middle Latin]]: ''{{lang|la|tunna}}'') is an English unit of ''liquid volume'' (not weight), used for measuring wine, oil or honey. Typically a large vat or vessel, most often holding 252&amp;nbsp;wine gallons, but occasionally other sizes (e.g. 256, 240 and 208&amp;nbsp;gallons) were also used.&lt;ref name=memoirs/&gt;

In one example from 1507, a tun is defined as 240&amp;nbsp;gallons.

{{anchor|pipe|butt}}
;Pipe or butt
The [[Butt (unit)|butt]] (from the [[Old French|mediæval French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''botte'') or pipe was half a tun, or 1008&amp;nbsp;pints. Tradition has it that [[George, Duke of Clarence]], the brother of [[Edward IV of England]], was drowned in a butt of [[malmsey]] on 18&amp;nbsp;February 1478.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/royalty/dukeac.html# |title=Dukes of Great Britain |access-date=2012-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218093912/http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/royalty/dukeac.html# |archive-date=2013-02-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070807195747/http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9249149 Biography Channel Duke of Clarence]&lt;/ref&gt; (However, [[Josephine Tey]] in ''The Daughter of Time'' suggests that "drowned in a butt of malmsey" means rather that George, Duke of Clarence, drank himself to death rather than literally drowning in a container of wine.) In [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]", the narrator claims he has received "a pipe of what passes for [[Amontillado]]". In [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s novel "[[Paul Clifford]]", Lord Mauleverer states to Lawyer William Brandon "Because he sent me, in the handsomest manner possible, a pipe of that wonderful [[Madeira wine|Madeira]], which you know I consider the chief grace of my cellars, and he gave up a canal navigation bill, which would have enriched his whole county, when he knew that it would injure my property."

{{anchor|puncheon|tertian}}
;Puncheon or tertian
The puncheon was a third of a tun. The term ''puncheon'', shortened to '''pon''' in the United States, is thought to derive from the fact that it would have been marked by use of a [[Punch (tool)|punch]] to denote its contents. The unit was also known as a ''tertian'' (from the [[Latin]] word for "third").&lt;ref name=memoirs/&gt;

;Hogshead
{{Main|Hogshead}}
Of comparable size to the [[English brewery cask units#Hogshead|beer hogshead]], the wine [[hogshead]] was equal to half a butt or a quarter of a tun.

;Tierce
{{Main|Tierce (unit)}}
Closely related to the modern [[barrel (unit)|oil barrel]], the tierce was half a puncheon, a third of a butt or a sixth of a tun.

;Barrel
The wine [[barrel (unit)|barrel]] was half a wine hogshead or an eighth of a tun.

;Rundlet
The rundlet was a seventh of a butt or a fourteenth of a tun.

==History==
Originally, the tun was defined as 256 wine gallons;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;{{gaps|256|{{=}}|2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is the basis for the name of the quarter of 64 [[corn gallon]]s. At some time before the 15th century, it was reduced to 252 gallons, so as to be evenly divisible by other small integers, including seven.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;252 = {{gaps|2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|×|3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|×|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that a 252-gallon tun of wine has an approximate mass of one [[long ton]].

With the adoption of the Queen Anne wine gallon of 231 [[cubic inch]]es the tun approximated the volume of a cylinder with both diameter and height of 42 inches.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The volume, ''V'', of this cylinder may be [[approximations of π|approximated]] from the height, ''h'', and the radius, ''r'', as follows.

|}&lt;/ref&gt; These were adopted as the standard US liquid gallon and tun.

When the imperial system was introduced the tun was redefined in the UK and colonies as 210 imperial gallons. The imperial tun remained evenly divisible by small integers.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;210 = {{gaps|2|×|3|×|5|×|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also little change in the actual value the tun.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The imperial tun is only about {{#expr:954.6789/9.53923769568-100round4}}% larger than the US tun assuming current definitions. Note that {{nowrap|5 imp gal ≈ 6 US gal}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:2+2.svg|thumb|right|200px|A well-known [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] featuring the equals sign]] The '''equals sign''' or '''equality sign''' ('''{{Big|1==}}''') is a [[mathematical symbol]] used to indicate [[equality (mathematics)|equality]]. It was invented in 1557 by [[Robert Recorde]]. In an [[equation]], the equals sign is placed between two (or more) expressions that have the same value. In [[Unicode]] and [[ASCII]], it is {{unichar|003d|equals sign|html=}}.

==History==
The etymology of the word "equal" is from the Latin word "''æqualis"'' as meaning "uniform", "identical", or "equal", from ''aequus'' ("level", "even", or "just").

[[Image:First Equation Ever.png|thumb|The first use of an equals sign, equivalent to 14''x''+15=71 in modern notation. From ''[[The Whetstone of Witte]]'' by [[Robert Recorde]].]]
[[Image:Recorde - The Whetstone of Witte - equals.jpg|thumb|Recorde's introduction of "="]]

The "=" symbol that is now universally accepted in mathematics for equality was first recorded by Welsh mathematician [[Robert Recorde]] in ''[[The Whetstone of Witte]]'' (1557). The original form of the symbol was much wider than the present form. In his book Recorde explains his design of the "Gemowe lines" (meaning ''twin'' lines, from the [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:gemellus|gemellus]]''&lt;ref name="gemellus"&gt;See also [[wiktionary:geminus|geminus]] and [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]].&lt;/ref&gt;):&lt;ref&gt;Recorde, Robert, ''The Whetstone of Witte'' … (London, England: Jhon Kyngstone, 1557), [https://archive.org/stream/TheWhetstoneOfWitte#page/n237/mode/2up the third page of the chapter "The rule of equation, commonly called Algebers Rule."]&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''And to auoide the tediouſe repetition of theſe woordes : is equalle to : I will ſette as I doe often in woorke vſe, a paire of paralleles, or Gemowe lines of one lengthe, thus: =, bicauſe noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle.'' 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And to avoid the tedious repetition of these words: is equal to: I will set as I do often in work use, a pair of parallels, or Gemowe lines of one length, thus: =, because no 2 things, can be more equal.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Scotland's [[University of St Andrews]] History of Mathematics website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Recorde.html | website = [[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]] | title = Robert Recorde | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The symbol '=' was not immediately popular. The symbol || was used by some and ''æ'' (or ''œ''), from the Latin word ''aequalis'' meaning equal, was widely used into the 1700s.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Usage in mathematics and computer programming==
In mathematics, the equals sign can be used as a simple statement of fact in a specific case (x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2), or to create definitions (let&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2), conditional statements (if&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, then …), or to express a universal equivalence &lt;code&gt;(x&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2x&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/code&gt;.

The first important [[computer programming language]] to use the equals sign was the original version of [[Fortran]], FORTRAN&amp;nbsp;I, designed in 1954 and implemented in 1957. In Fortran, "=" serves as an [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]] operator: &lt;code&gt;X&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/code&gt; sets the value of &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; to 2. This somewhat resembles the use of "=" in a mathematical definition, but with different semantics: the expression following "=" is evaluated first and may refer to a previous value of &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the assignment &lt;code&gt;X&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;X&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/code&gt; increases the value of &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; by 2.

A rival programming-language usage was pioneered by the original version of [[ALGOL]], which was designed in 1958 and implemented in 1960. ALGOL included a [[relational operator]] that tested for equality, allowing constructions like &lt;code&gt;if&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/code&gt; with essentially the same meaning of "=" as the conditional usage in mathematics. The equals sign was reserved for this usage.

Both usages have remained common in different programming languages into the early 21st century. As well as Fortran, "=" is used for assignment in such languages as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[awk]], and their descendants. But "=" is used for equality and not assignment in the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] family, [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[APL (programming language)|APL]], and other languages.

A few languages, such as [[BASIC]] and [[PL/I]], have used the equals sign to mean both assignment and equality, distinguished by context. However, in most languages where "=" has one of these meanings, a different character or, more often, a sequence of characters is used for the other meaning. Following ALGOL, most languages that use "=" for equality use ":=" for assignment, although APL, with its special character set, uses a left-pointing arrow.

Fortran did not have an equality operator (it was only possible to compare an expression to zero, using the [[arithmetic IF]] statement) until FORTRAN&amp;nbsp;IV was released in 1962, since when it has used the four characters ".EQ." to test for equality. The language [[B (programming language)|B]] introduced the use of "==" with this meaning, which has been copied by its descendant C and most later languages where "=" means assignment.

The equals sign is also used in defining [[attribute–value pair]]s, in which an [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]] is assigned a [[Value (computer science)|value]].{{ctn|date=June 2013}}

===Usage of several equals signs===
In [[PHP]], the [[===|triple equals sign (&lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;)]] denotes value and [[Data type|type]] equality,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| url        = http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php
| title      = Comparison Operators
| website    = PHP.net
| accessdate = 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that not only do the two expressions evaluate to equal values, they are also of the same data type. For instance, the expression &lt;code&gt;0&amp;nbsp;==&amp;nbsp;false&lt;/code&gt; is true, but &lt;code&gt;0&amp;nbsp;===&amp;nbsp;false&lt;/code&gt; is not, because the number 0 is an integer value whereas false is a Boolean value.

[[JavaScript]] has the same semantics for &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;, referred to as "equality without type coercion". However, in JavaScript the behavior of &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; cannot be described by any simple consistent rules. The expression &lt;code&gt;0&amp;nbsp;==&amp;nbsp;false&lt;/code&gt; is true, but &lt;code&gt;0&amp;nbsp;==&amp;nbsp;undefined&lt;/code&gt; is false, even though both sides of the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; act the same in Boolean context. For this reason it is recommended to avoid the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operator in JavaScript in favor of &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

In Ruby, equality under &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; requires both operands to be of identical type, e.g. &lt;code&gt;0&amp;nbsp;==&amp;nbsp;false&lt;/code&gt; is false. The &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; operator is flexible and may be defined arbitrarily for any given type. For example, a value of type &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; is a range of integers, such as &lt;code&gt;1800..1899&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;(1800..1899)&amp;nbsp;==&amp;nbsp;1844&lt;/code&gt; is false, since the types are different (Range vs. Integer); however &lt;code&gt;(1800..1899)&amp;nbsp;===&amp;nbsp;1844&lt;/code&gt; is true, since &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; values means "inclusion in the range".&lt;ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The equals sign is sometimes used in Japanese as a separator between names.

===Spelling===
====Tone letter====
The equals sign is also used as a grammatical [[tone letter]] in the orthographies of [[Budu language|Budu]] in the [[Congo-Kinshasa]], in [[Krumen language|Krumen]], [[Mwan language|Mwan]] and [[Dan language|Dan]] in the [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Peter G.

====Personal names====
[[File:Assinatura do Santos Dumont 2.png|thumb|The signature of Santos-Dumont, showing a hyphen that looks like an equal sign.]]

A possibly unique case of the equals sign of European usage in a person's name, specifically in a [[double-barreled name]], was by pioneer aviator [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], as he is also known not only to have often used an equals sign (=) between his [[double-barreled name|two surnames]] in place of a hyphen, but also seems to have personally preferred that practice, to display equal respect for his father's French ethnicity and the Brazilian ethnicity of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Carroll F.|title=The 1906 Santos=Dumont No. 14bis |journal=World War I Aeroplanes |volume=No. 194 |date=November 2006 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linguistics === 
In linguistic [[interlinear gloss]]es, an equals sign is conventionally used to mark clitic boundaries: the equals sign is placed between the [[clitic]] and the word that the clitic is attached to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conventions for interlinear morpheme-by-morpheme glosses| url = https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php| access-date = 2017-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry===
In [[chemical formula]]s, the two parallel lines denoting a [[double bond]] are commonly rendered using an equals sign.

===LGBT symbol===
{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}
In recent years, the equals sign has been used to [[LGBT symbols|symbolize]] [[LGBT rights]]. The symbol has been used since 1995 by the [[Human Rights Campaign]], which lobbies for [[marriage equality]], and subsequently by the [[United Nations Free &amp; Equal]], which promotes [[LGBT rights at the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrc.org/hrc-story/about-our-logo&lt;/ref&gt;

===Not equal===
The symbol used to denote [[inequation]] (when items are not equal) is a [[Slash (punctuation)|slashed]] equals sign "≠" (U+2260; 2260,Alt+X in [[Microsoft Windows]]). In [[LaTeX]], this is done with the "\neq" command.

Most programming languages, limiting themselves to the [[ASCII|7-bit ASCII]] [[character set]] and [[QWERTY|typeable characters]], use &lt;code&gt;~=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/=&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to represent their [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] [[inequality operator]].

===Identity===
The [[triple bar]] symbol "≡" (U+2261, LaTeX ''\equiv'') is often used to indicate an [[identity (mathematics)|identity]], a [[definition]] (which can also be represented by U+225D "[[≝]]" or U+2254 "[[≔]]"), or a [[congruence relation]] in [[modular arithmetic]]. The symbol "[[≘]]" can be used to express that an item [[Correspondence (mathematics)|corresponds]] to another.

===Isomorphism===
The symbol "≅" is often used to indicate [[isomorphic]] algebraic structures or [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] geometric figures.

===In logic===
Equality of [[truth value]]s, i.e. [[bi-implication]] or [[logical equivalence]], may be denoted by various symbols including =, ~, and ⇔.

==Incorrect usage==
The equals sign is sometimes used incorrectly within a mathematical argument to connect math steps in a non-standard way, rather than to show equality (especially by early mathematics students).

For example, if one were finding the sum, step by step, of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, one might incorrectly write
:1 + 2 = 3 + 3 = 6 + 4 = 10 + 5 = 15.
Structurally, this is shorthand for
:([(1 + 2 = 3) + 3 = 6] + 4 = 10) + 5 = 15,
but the notation is incorrect, because each part of the equality has a different value. If interpreted strictly as it says, it implies
:3 = 6 = 10 = 15 = 15.
A correct version of the argument would be
:1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 4 = 10, 10 + 5 = 15.

This difficulty results from subtly different uses of the sign in education. In early, arithmetic-focused grades, the equals sign may be ''operational''; like the equals button on an electronic calculator, it demands the result of a calculation. Starting in algebra courses, the sign takes on a ''relational'' meaning of equality between two calculations. Confusion between the two uses of the sign sometimes persists at the university level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://tamu.academia.edu/SencerCorlu/Papers/522225/Capraro_R._M._Capraro_M._M._Yetkiner_Z._E._Corlu_M._S._Ozel_S._Ye_S._and_Kim_H._G._2011_._An_international_perspective_between_problem_types_in_textbooks_and_students_understanding_of_relational_equality._Mediterranean_Journal_for_Research_in_Mathematics_Education_An_International_Journal_10_187-213 | title = An International Perspective between Problem Types in Textbooks and Students' understanding of relational equality | last = Capraro | first = Robert M. | last2 = Capraro | first2 = Mary Margaret | last3 = Yetkiner | first3 = Ebrar Z. | last4 = Corlu | first4 = Sencer M. | last5 = Ozel | first5 = Serkan | last6 = Ye | first6 = Sun | last7 = Kim | first7 = Hae Gyu | journal = Mediterranean Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 10 | number = 1–2 | pages = 187–213 | year = 2011 | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3340">'''Executive home''' is a marketing term for a moderately large and well-appointed house.

Such houses were formerly described as ''mansionettes'' or ''bijou residences''. The word [[mansion]] historically denotes homes with more character or uniqueness than an average executive home. This is because executive homes are usually constructed among homes of very similar size and type by a subdivider on speculation; they are generally built en-masse by development companies to be marketed as premium real estate. Executive homes can differ from traditional mansions mostly in their parcel size, since many of these newer homes are built on increasingly small lots so developers can maximize available acreage.

Executive homes are generally found in outlying suburban areas because lot sizes in older neighborhoods generally are not conducive to new residences of this large scale.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;http://www.startribune.com/local/west/15495036.html, Accessed on June 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; However there have been many instances of developers buying large lots or multiple lots in historic neighborhoods, demolishing the older homes and building executive homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/yourtown/wellesley/articles/2009/02/05/taking_stock_of_house_law/ Accessed on June 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This may have the effect of destroying the setting of older neighborhoods, and adversely impacting the integrity of historic districts. These lots are in desirable neighborhoods, and desirable [[school district]]s, and are close to urban centers, so the trend will likely continue. However, some communities such as [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] and [[Austin, Texas]] have created policies and ordinances to retain older neighborhoods against these development pressures.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==History==

==Role and Purpose==
Formerly under [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]], independent Republic of [[Lebanon]] designates [[Arabic]] as the sole official language, while a special law regulates cases when French can be publicly used.

Article 11 of Lebanon's Constitution states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Arabic is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the [[French language]] is to be used".&lt;ref name="article_11"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The French language is used on [[Lebanese pound]] bank notes, road signs, [[Vehicle registration plates of Lebanon|vehicle registration plates]], and on public buildings, alongside Arabic.             

The majority of Lebanese people speak [[Lebanese Arabic]], which is grouped in a larger category called [[Levantine Arabic]], while [[Modern Standard Arabic]] is mostly used in magazines, newspapers, and formal broadcast media.  [[Code-switching]] between Arabic and French is very common.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10316914 |title=Campaign to save the Arabic language in Lebanon |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |date=24 June 2010 |author=Hesham Shawish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-10-05/beirut-residents-switch-languages-practically-each-breath |title=Is Beirut the codeswitching capital of the world? |date=October 5, 2015 |author=Dalia Mortada |newspaper=[[Public Radio International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ideas.ted.com/dont-kill-your-language/ |title=Don’t kill your language |date=October 27, 2015 |author=Suzanne Talhouk |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost 40% of Lebanese are considered [[francophone]], and another 15% "partial francophone," and 70% of Lebanon's secondary schools use French as a second language of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=liZwswxx7TcC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=French+language+Lebanon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAmoVChMIkKzCp57pyAIVB1oeCh23GAF1#v=onepage&amp;q=Lebanon&amp;f=false|title=The Story of French|first1=Jean-Benoit|last1=Nadeau|first2=Julie|last2=Barlow|date=28 May 2010|publisher=Knopf Canada|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NadeauBarlow2008"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of French |author=Jean-Benoît Nadeau, Julie Barlow |year=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-34184-8 |page=311 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NN5oc0HFC7QC&amp;pg=PA311 |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[English language|English]] is used as a secondary language in 30% of Lebanon's secondary schools.&lt;ref name="NadeauBarlow2008" /&gt; The use of Arabic by Lebanon's educated youth is declining, as they usually prefer to speak in French and, to a lesser extent, English.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic – a dying language?|url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20100625-arabic-dying-language-lebanon-beirut |publisher=France 24 |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes toward French==

[[Image:Had to take this one..jpg|right|thumb|French language inscription "Banque du Liban" on the headquarter of the [[Bank of Lebanon]].]]

French and English are secondary languages of [[Lebanon]], with about 45% of the population being Francophone as a second language and 30% Anglophone.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=217}} The use of English is growing in the business and media environment. Out of about 900,000 students, about 500,000 are enrolled in Francophone schools, public or private, in which the teaching of mathematics and scientific subjects is provided in French.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=218}} Actual usage of French varies depending on the region and social status. One third of high school students educated in French go on to pursue higher education in English-speaking institutions. English is the language of business and communication, with French being an element of social distinction, chosen for its emotional value.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=358}}

==Lebanese French==
Lebanese French ({{lang-fr|français libanais}}) is a [[Varieties of French|dialect of French]] spoken in Lebanon. It is commonly spoken in Lebanon, as [[French language]] is taught in schools as a second language following [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

'''George Dalgarno''' (c. 1616 – 1687) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] intellectual interested in [[natural language|linguistic]] problems. Originally from [[Aberdeen]], he later worked as a schoolteacher in [[Oxford]] in collaboration with [[John Wilkins]], although the two parted company intellectually in 1659.

==Life==
Dalgarno matriculated at [[Marischal College, Aberdeen]], in 1631. Subsequently he was a schoolteacher in Oxford in the 1650s. In 1657, he was encouraged to upgrade a system of [[shorthand]] on which he was working, by [[Samuel Hartlib]], to a more ambitious universal system and he published on the subject later the same year. This effort brought him into contact with members of the [[Oxford Philosophical Club]], one of the precursors of the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=7023|title=Dalgarno, George|first=David|last=Cram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Dalgarno was the author of ''Didascalocophus or the Deaf and Dumb man's tutor'' (1680), which proposed a totally new linguistic system for use by [[deaf mute]]s. The system is still used in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cce.ufsc.br/~espanhol/projborges/tlon.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810201023/http://www.cce.ufsc.br/~espanhol/projborges/tlon.htm |archivedate=10 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dalgarno Ars Signorum.jpg|thumb|Title page of Dalgarno's ''Ars Signorum'' (1661).]]
Dalgarno was also interested in constructing what he called a '[[philosophical language]]', now more usually referred to as [[universal language]]. A modern translation of his ''Ars signorum'' (''Art of Signs'', 1661) was published in 2001 in an edition that also includes his autobiography and other manuscript writings.

'''Gergely Czuczor''' (17 December 1800 - 9 September 1866) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[Benedictine]] [[monk]], a [[poet]] and [[linguist]], member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forrasfolyoirat.hu/0010/bencze.html A népdalgyűjtő és népdalíró Czuczor Gergely]&lt;/ref&gt; Baptized István (the equivalent of which is Stephen) he took Gergely (George) as his religious name.

As down-to-earth common sense a poet as [[Sándor Petőfi|Petőfi]]: his national poems also quickly became folk songs and popular. Both poets tended to emulate the rhythm of folk songs in their poems, which served the Nationalist cause in the popular common sense way.

He participated in the fight for freedom against [[Habsburg]] rule. One of his most famous poems, "Riadó" i.e. 'Alarm', was published in [[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]]'s newspaper on December 21, 1848 while the Austrian troops were already closing in on Pest-Buda. It was also published on flyers, separately, and it quickly propagated amongst soldiers and the people as a sort of a march of the revolution quite as Petőfi's poems would.

A translation of the first part of his poem "Riadó":
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Alarm

Screaming is the army whistle: alarmed be Hungarian alarmed!
To battle your country's calling, with sharpened steel be armed.
Its lightning may the dawn of freedom be painting,
And the purple of tyrant species into blood bath sinking.

Alive ever is the Hungarians' great god still,
Fear shall who against him attack will.
Even god is helping, us defeat, who could?
Once free peoples we'd been, and anew we should.
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''German Sign Language''' or '''Deutsche Gebärdensprache''' is the [[sign language]] of the [[deaf community]] in [[Germany]] and in the German-speaking community of [[Belgium]]. It is often abbreviated as DGS. It is unclear how many use German Sign Language as their main language; [[Gallaudet University]] estimated 50,000 in 1986.
The language has evolved  through use in deaf communities over hundreds of years.

==Recognition==
Germany has a strong [[oralism|oralist]] tradition and historically has seen a suppression of sign language. German Sign Language was first [[Recognition of sign languages|legally recognised]] in ''The Federal Disability Equality Act (2002)''  in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disability-europe.net/en/countries/Germany/DE-2-factsEN.jsp?jsEnabled=1 |title=ANED – countries – Germany – Facts and figures |accessdate={{Date|2011-03-20|mdy}} |publisher=disability-europe.net }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, deaf people have a legal entitlement to Sign Language interpreters when communicating with federal authorities, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gehoerlosenbund.de Deutscher Gehörlosen-Bund e.V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few television programs include an interpreter; those that do are the news and a news "round-up". There is at least one programme conducted entirely in German Sign Language called "Sehen statt Hören" (Seeing Instead of Hearing), a documentary-style programme produced by the [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] (BR) and broadcast on Saturday mornings on Bayerischer Rundfunk and the other regional state broadcasters in Germany.

==German and German Sign Language==
German Sign Language is unrelated to [[German (language)|spoken German]]. While spoken German builds sentences following a ''subject – verb – object'' pattern, German Sign Language uses a ''subject object verb'' strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Fabian Bross &amp; Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language]. In: Glossa. A Journal of General Linguistics, 2(1): 76. 1-30&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the two have very different grammars, though as the dominant language of the region, German has had some influence on German Sign Language. A signed system that follows German grammar, [[Signed German]] (''Lautsprachbegleitende Gebärden'' or ''Lautbegleitende Gebärden'', "sound-accompanying signs"), is used in education. It is not used as a natural means of communication between deaf people.  Another system of manually representing German is [[cued speech]], known as ''Phonembestimmes Manualsystem'' (Phonemic Manual System).

==Manual alphabet and fingerspelling==
[[Image:A diaeresis - DGS.svg|thumb|100px|'''Ä''' in DGS]]German Sign Language uses a one-handed [[manual alphabet]] ('Fingeralphabet' in German) derived from the French manual alphabet of the 18th century; it is related to manual alphabets used across Europe and in North America.

==Dialects and related languages==
{{main|German Sign Language family}}
Regional variants of German Sign Language include Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich sign. Sign languages of regions in the former [[East Germany]] have a greater divergence from sign languages of the western regions; some may be unrelated. [[Polish Sign Language]] is descended from German Sign Language. [[Israeli Sign Language]] may be as well, as it evolved from the sign language used by German Jewish teachers who opened a school for deaf children in Jerusalem in 1932, and still shows some resemblance to its German counterpart. It is not related to [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is used in parts of southern Germany, nor to [[Swiss Sign Language]], both of which are part of the [[French Sign Language family]], though they have had some influence from German Sign Language.

==Notation systems==
Everyday users of German Sign Language use no written form of the language. In academic contexts, German Sign Language is usually described with the [[Hamburg Notation System|Hamburg notation system]] or HamNoSys. [[SignWriting]] also has its adherents in Germany.

==Grammar==
The grammar of German Sign Language may be described in terms of the conventional linguistic categories [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[morphosyntax]] and [[syntax]].

===Phonology===

Signs are made up of a combination of different elements from each of the classes of [[distinctive feature]]s: handshape, hand orientation, location and movement. If one of these elements is changed, it can result in a sign with a completely different meaning. Two signs differing in only one element are deemed to be a [[minimal pair]]. German Sign Language uses 32 handshapes, of which six are basic handshapes found in all sign languages.

Two-handed signs are signs which are necessarily performed with both hands. Their formation is in accordance with certain [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] limitations, such as the rule of symmetry (when both hands move at the same time, they have the same handshape) and the rule of dominance (if the two hands have different handshapes, only the dominant hand is moved while the non-dominant hand remains passive).

Uninflected lexical signs in German Sign Language have at most two syllables. [[Syllable]]s consist of two syllabic positions, described as ''Hold'' (H) and ''Movement'' (M). ''Holds'' consist of the handshape together with the hand orientation (together referred to as the hand configuration) at a specific location in signing space. ''Holds'' do not contain any change of location (movement from one location to another). ''Movements'', on the other hand, involve a change of location and may involve secondary movements such as wiggling of the fingers. Syllables may then be grouped into the following types: M (the minimal syllable), HM, MH, HMH (the maximal syllable). In the case of HM syllables, for example, the hand configuration of the  ''Movement'' moves away from the location of the ''Hold''. A syllable of type M can consist of the following specifications: a path movement (from one location to another), a path movement with secondary movement (such as wiggling or twisting), or a secondary movement without path movement. The syllable type H (a segment without a ''Movement'') is not allowed for phonotactical reasons.

An elementary component of lexical signs are non-manual lexical markings, such as movements of eyes (rolling, widening), mouth (puffing, rounding) and face, as well as the whole head (nodding, tilting) and upper body (leaning). These are obligatory accompaniments of a quarter of all lexical signs. Making visual syllables with the mouth is referred to as [[mouthing]].

=== Syntax ===

==== Clause structure ====

===== Unmarked word order =====

The [[markedness|unmarked]] [[word order]] in DGS is [[subject-object-verb]], similar to languages such as Turkish, Japanese and Latin, but differing from [[German language|German]].

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''verb'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  || ARBEIT || SUCH-
|-
| "you" || "work" || "search"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''You are looking for a job.'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''verb'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  || BROT || &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;GEB-&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[cl:Brot]
|-
| "I" || "bread" || "&lt;sub&gt;I-&lt;/sub&gt;give&lt;sub&gt;-you(-something-bread-shaped)&lt;/sub&gt;"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''I give you (the) bread.'''''
|}

If an indirect object appears in the sentence, it stands before the direct object.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''indirect object''' || '''direct object''' || '''verb'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || [POSS]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; VATER&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || BROT || &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;GEB-&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[cl:Brot]
|-
| "I" || "my father" || "bread" || "&lt;sub&gt;I-&lt;/sub&gt;give&lt;sub&gt;-him(-something-bread-shaped)&lt;/sub&gt;"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''I give my father (the) bread.'''''
|}

In sentences with chains of verbs, auxiliary verbs and similar usually appear after the full verb, the opposite of English word order.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  || ARBEIT || SUCH- || MÜSS-
|-
| "you" || "work" || "search" || "must"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''You have to look for a job.'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  || RADFAHR- || KÖNN-NICHT
|-
| "I" || "ride-a-bike" || "cannot"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''I can't ride a bike.'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  || KOMM- || VERSUCH-
|-
| "I" || "come" || "try"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''I'll try to come.'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''Subject''' || '''object''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"Modalverb"'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  || WOHNUNG || PUTZ- || KEINE-LUST-HAB-
|-
| "I" || "apartment" || "clean" || "can't-be-bothered"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''I can't be bothered cleaning the apartment.'''''
|}

The Personal Agreement Marker (glossed as "PAM"), which looks almost like the sign for "person" and may be accompanied by the mouthing "auf" ("on"), is a sign used to indicate the location in signing space of animate objects when the verb in the sentence does not do this. It roughly fills the roll of object pronouns, however it seems to function more as an auxiliary verb, inflecting for person where the main verb does not. Although there is considerable variation, especially across dialects, it tends to occur where auxiliaries occur, after the verb, rather than in the object slot. The benefactive marker (glossed as "BEM") is similarly placed.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  || LIEB- || [PAM]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| "I" || "love" || "you"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''I love you.'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  || ARZT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || LIEB- || [PAM]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| "I" || "doctor" || "love" || "him/her"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''I love the doctor.'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  || BUCH || KAUF- || [BEM]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| "I" || "book" || "buy" || "for-you"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''I bought a book for you.'''''
|}

Time expressions (''tomorrow'', ''next week'') appear at the beginning of the sentence (as a discourse topic).

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''time''' || '''subject''' || '''indirect object''' || '''direct object''' || '''Verb'''
|-
| GESTERN || FRAU&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || [POSS]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; SCHWESTER&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || BUCH || &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GEB-&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[cl:Buch]
|-
| "yesterday" || "woman" || "my sister" || "book" || "&lt;sub&gt;she&lt;/sub&gt;-give&lt;sub&gt;-her(-something-book-shaped)&lt;/sub&gt;"
|-
| colspan="5" |  '''''Yesterday a/the woman gave my sister a/the book.'''''
|}

Phrases specifying location tend to occur at the beginning of the sentence (after the time information).

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''time''' || '''location''' || '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''verb'''
|-
| GESTERN || UNIVERSITÄT [LOK]&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; || [PRON]1 || MANN NETT || KENNENLERN-
|-
| "yesterday" || "university there" || "I" || "man nice" || "meet"
|-
| colspan="5" |  '''''I met a nice man at the university yesterday.'''''
|}

This follows the figure-ground-principle, according to which smaller, more mobile referents (figures) tend to occur after larger, less mobile referents (ground).

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''ground''' || '''figure''' || '''verb'''
|-
| WALD&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; || HAUS  || STEH-&lt;sub&gt;in-A&lt;/sub&gt;[cl:Haus]
|-
| "forest" || "house" || "&lt;sub&gt;house-shaped-object-&lt;/sub&gt;is-situated-&lt;sub&gt;there&lt;/sub&gt;"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''There is a house in the forest.'''''
|}

Sentence [[adverb]]s often appear at the beginning of the sentence.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''sentence adverb''' || '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''verb'''
|-
| HOFF || [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || HUND || KAUF-
|-
| "hope" || "s/he" || "dog" || "buy"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''Hopefully s/he'll buy a dog.'''''
|}

However, [[adverb]]s that modify the verb but which cannot be expressed non-manually follow the verb as an extra clause.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''verb''' || '''adverbial clause'''
|-
| [POSS]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; CHEF || TANZ-, || SCHÖN
|-
| "my boss" || "dance" || "beautiful"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''My boss dances beautifully. / My boss dances and it's beautiful.'''''
|}

Wh-words (interrogatives) usually occur at the end of the sentence after the verb.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"''' || '''Wh'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || BESTELL-  || WÜNSCH- || WAS
|-
| "you" || "order" || "desire" || "what"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''What would you like to order?'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"''' || '''Wh'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || D-G-S  || LERN- || WÜNSCH- || WARUM
|-
| "you" || "DGS" || "learn" || "desire" || "why"
|-
| colspan="5" |  '''''Why do you want to learn DGS?'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"''' || '''Wh'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || SOZIAL WISSENSCHAFT  || STUDIER- || ANFANG- || WANN
|-
| "du" || "social sciences" || "study-at-university" || "begin" || "when"
|-
| colspan="5" |  '''''How long have you been studying social sciences at university?'''''
|}

Some signs with a negative meaning tend to occur at the end of the sentence.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''verb''' || '''negation'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || [POSS]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; GELIEBTE(R)  || KENNENLERN- || NOCH-NICHT
|-
| "ich" || "your partner" || "meet" || "not-yet"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''I haven't met your girlfriend/boyfriend/partner/husband/wife yet.'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"''' || '''negation'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ESS-  || WÜNSCH- || NICHTS
|-
| "I" || "eat" || "desire" || "nothing"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''I don't want to eat anything (at all).'''''
|}

However, if the negation is not emphasised, it can also appear in the expected position.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || NICHTS || ESS-  || WÜNSCH- 
|-
| "I" || "nothing" || "eat" || "desire"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''I don't want to eat anything.'''''
|}

Determiners ([[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[demonstrative]]s, [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s, [[relative pronouns]]) follow the noun.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''noun''' || '''determiner'''
|-
| BUCH || [DEM]&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| "book" || "this"
|-
| colspan="2" |  '''''this book'''''
|}

Their function is to set the location of referents within the signing space. If this is indicated instead by directional verbs, determiners can always be omitted, provided they are not required for other reasons (such as showing possession, pluralisation, etc.) There is no distinction between definite and indefinite articles.

Attributive [[adjective]]s follow immediately after the noun.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''Nomen''' || '''Adjektiv'''
|-
| BUCH || NEU 
|-
| "book" || "new"
|-
| colspan="2" |  '''''a/the new book'''''
|}

The [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''to be'' does not exist in DGS. Predicative adjectives are generally separated from the noun by a  [[determiner]].

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''noun''' || '''determiner''' || '''adjective'''
|-
| BUCH || [DEM]&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; || NEU 
|-
| "book" || "this" || "new"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''This book is new.'''''
|}

Compare the preceding sentence to the following noun phrase, in which the determiner follows the adjective.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''noun''' || '''adjective''' || '''determiner'''
|-
| BUCH || NEU || [DEM]&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| "book" || "new" || "this"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''this new book'''''
|}

[[Possessive adjectives]] stand between the possessor and the possession.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''Besitzer''' || '''Possessiv''' || '''Besitz'''
|-
| MANN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || [POSS]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || AUTO 
|-
| "man" || "his" || "car"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''the man's car'''''
|}

Here is an example of a longer but nevertheless simple, unmarked sentence.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''time''' || '''location''' || '''subject''' || '''indirect object || '''direct object ''' || '''"full verb"''' || '''"auxiliary"''' || '''Wh'''
|-
| LETZTE-WOCHE || [POSS]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; VATER&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [POSS]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; HAUS [LOK]&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; || [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || [POSS]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; MUTTER&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ||  GELD || &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GEB-&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || WÜNSCH- || WARUM
|-
| "last-week" || "my father his house there" || "you" || "my mother" || "money" || "&lt;sub&gt;you-&lt;/sub&gt;give&lt;sub&gt;-her&lt;/sub&gt;" || "desire" || "why"
|-
| colspan="8" |  '''''Why did you want to give my mother money at my father's house last week?'''''
|}

===== Marked sentences =====

Parts of the sentence which are moved outside of their usual unmarked position are accompanied by non-manual marking.

Sentence elements (with the exception of verbs) can be [[topic and comment|topicalised]] by being moved to the beginning of the sentence and marked with raised eyebrows.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''topicalised object''' || '''subject''' || '''verb'''
|-
| ''eyebrows raised'' || || ''head shake''
|-
| FRAU [DEM]&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;  || [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || MÖG-
|-
| "woman that" || "I" || "&lt;sub&gt;don't-&lt;/sub&gt;like"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''I don't like that woman. / That woman, I don't like.'''''
|}

Often, a topic doesn't otherwise have any other role in the sentence. In these cases, it represents a limitation of the scope of the sentence. Compare the following three sentences.

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''verb'''
|-
| [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ITALIEN || LIEBHAB-
|-
| "I" || "Italy" || "adore"
|-
| colspan="3" |  '''''I love Italy.'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''topic''' || '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''verb'''
|-
| ''eyebrows raised'' || || ||
|-
| LAND  || [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ITALIEN || LIEBHAB-
|-
| "country" || "I" || "Italy" || "adore"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''My favourite country is Italy.'''''
|}

::{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
| '''topic''' || '''subject''' || '''object''' || '''verb'''
|-
| ''eyebrows raised'' || || ||
|-
| ESSEN  || [PRON]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ITALIEN || LIEBHAB-
|-
| "food" || "I" || "Italy" || "adore"
|-
| colspan="4" |  '''''My favourite food is Italian.'''''
|}

The Herrmann wall phone was a type of telephone, created by the Portuguese inventor, Maximiliano Augusto Herrmann, in 1880.
The pioneering use of buttons to activate the telephone played a fundamental role to the opening of public lines in the main cities of Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundacao.telecom.pt/en/Home/HistoryandHeritage/PTsHistory/HistoricalEquipment/Detail/tabid/350/itemId/545/parId/346/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The telephone was composed by a double earpiece, made with long flexible tubes, and a transmitter fixed to main body of the machine. 

Its inventor, Maximiliano Augusto Herrmann, worked for the North and East Portuguese Railway Company (Portuguese: ''Companhia dos Caminhos-de-ferro do Norte e Leste'') as telegraph lines inspector. He later opened a workshop dedicated to the production of precision instruments.

'''Hutterite German''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Hutterisch'') is an [[Upper German]] dialect of the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] variety of the [[German language]], which is spoken by [[Hutterite]] communities in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Hutterite is also called '''Tirolean''', but this is an anachronism.

==Distribution and literacy==
Hutterite is spoken in the US states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Montana]], [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Oregon]]; and in the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]]. Its speakers belong to the ''Schmiedleit'', ''Lehrerleit'', and ''Dariusleit'' Hutterite groups, but there are also some few speakers among the older generations of ''Prairieleit'' (the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies). Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies learn and speak first Hutterite German before learning [[English language|English]], the standard language of the surrounding areas.

As of 2003, there are about 34,000 speakers in the world, 85% of them living in 333 communities in Canada and the remaining 15% in 123 communities in the USA. Canadian adults are generally literate in [[Early New High German]] (also called "Biblical German", the predecessor to [[Standard German]] used by [[Martin Luther]]) that they employ as the written form for Scriptures while [[Standard German]] is used in the USA for religious activities.  Children learn English at school; Canadian Hutterites have a functional knowledge of English. Hutterite is for the most part an unwritten language, though in August 2006 Hutterite author Linda Maendel released a children's story titled ''Lindas glücklicher Tag'' (Linda's Happy Day) in which all the dialogue is written in the dialect. Maendel is also working on a series of biblical stories with Wycliff Bible translators.

==History and related languages==
Hutterite German is a [[koiné language]] based on the Bavarian dialects spoken in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], home of [[Jacob Hutter]], and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] in the mid-18th century. It is only 50% intelligible to a speaker of [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=geh The Ethnologue, 16th ed]&lt;/ref&gt; as the latter variant is based on dialects spoken around the [[Electoral Palatinate]]. Hutterite German therefore belongs to the [[Southern Bavarian]] dialect group which is spoken in the southern parts of [[Bavaria]] and in [[Austria]] except for the westernmost part ([[Vorarlberg]]).

Although the Hutterites once spoke Tirolean German, they no longer do. The switch among Hutterites from Tirolean German to Carinthian German occurred during years of severe persecution in Europe when Hutterite communities were devastated and survival depended on the conversion of many Carinthian ''[[Transylvanian Landler|Landler]]'' refugees to Hutterite [[anabaptism]].

The language has adopted a limited number of [[Russian language|Russian]] and also many English loan words, which are the result of Hutterite migrations into [[Eastern Europe]] and now [[North America]]. The core vocabulary is still almost exclusively of German origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2853">'''James Kitchener Davies''' (16 June 1902 – 25 August 1952),&lt;ref name="NLoW"&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-DAVI-KIT-1902.html National Library of Wales] Biography of James Kitchener Davies&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''J. Kitchener Davies''', was a [[Wales|Welsh]] poet and playwright who wrote mostly in the [[Welsh language]]. Davies's work is highly influenced by the industrial landscape of his adopted village of [[Trealaw]] in the [[Rhondda]] Valley and his own nationalistic beliefs.

Born and brought up in [[Llangeitho]] in [[Ceredigion]], Davies spent his working life in the newly industrialised coalfields of the Rhondda Valley. The sometimes bleak conditions of his early life, especially as his early adulthood coincided with the economic despair of the depression, is reflected in his plays. Davies was part of the [[Cadwgan Circle]], a literary group of likeminded writers from Rhondda, that centred their image of Wales on the new industrialised society they were brought up in. Members of the Circle included [[Rhydwen Williams]], [[Pennar Davies]] and [[Gareth Alban Davies]].

His early play ''Cwm Glo'' (1934) was seen as controversial because it dealt with the social impact of the depression without the cultural romanticism which was stereotypical of Welsh literature. His verse play ''Meini Gwagedd'' (1944) is set in the [[Tregaron]] area and again looks at the harshness of the industrialised Wales and the self-destructive nature of people when drawn into a spiral of ill fortune.

In 1945, Davies stood in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|United Kingdom general election]], standing in the [[Rhondda East (UK Parliament constituency)|Rhondda East constituency]] as the first member of [[Plaid Cymru]] to contest the seat in the Rhondda Valleys. He came last out of three candidates, gaining 2,123 votes (6.1%).&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1996), pg. 161&lt;/ref&gt; The next election, in [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1950]] he ran again, this time the [[Rhondda West (UK Parliament constituency)|Rhondda West constituency]] seat. He increased his vote to 6.6% and then improved this in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 election]] when he polled slightly higher with 7.7% of the vote, again in the Rhondda West constituency.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1996), pg. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linking R''' and '''intrusive R''' are [[sandhi]] or ''linking'' phenomena&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trudgill|Gordon|2006|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving the appearance of the [[rhotic consonant]] (which normally corresponds to the letter {{angbr|r}}) between two consecutive morphemes where it would not normally be pronounced. These phenomena occur in many [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhotic]] [[List of dialects of the English language|varieties of English]], such as those in most of England and Wales, part of the United States, and all of the Anglophone societies of the southern hemisphere, with the exception of South Africa. These phenomena first appeared in English sometime after the year 1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Peters|1996|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-rhotic varieties==
{{Main|Rhoticity in English}}

By definition, non-rhotic varieties of English only pronounce {{IPA|/r/}}&lt;ref&gt;The rhotic consonant of English is transcribed in various ways depending on dialect, for example {{IPAblink|r}}, {{IPAblink|ɹ}} or {{IPAblink|ɻ}}. For this article, {{IPA|/r/}} is used without regard to the exact realisation of the consonant and without attempting to make any claim about its [[phoneme|phonemic]] status.&lt;/ref&gt; when it immediately precedes a vowel. This is called ''r''-vocalisation, ''r''-loss, ''r''-deletion, ''r''-dropping, ''r''-lessness, or non-rhoticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gick|1999|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in non-rhotic varieties of English, the sound {{IPA|/r/}} does not occur in a word such as ''tuner'' when it is spoken in isolation, before an intonation break (in [[pausa]]), or before a word beginning with a consonant. Even though the word is spelled with an {{angbr|r}} (which reflects that an {{IPA|/r/}} was pronounced in the past&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1970|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;), non-rhotic accents do not pronounce an {{IPA|/r/}} when there is no vowel sound to follow it. Thus, in isolation, speakers of non-rhotic accents may pronounce the words ''tuner'' and ''tuna'' identically as {{IPA|/ˈtjuːnə/}} (or {{IPA|/ˈtuːnə/}} with the [[yod-dropping]] that typically occurs in the non-rhotic dialects of the northeastern United States, or {{IPA|/ˈtʃuːnə/}} with the [[yod-coalescence]] that occurs in [[Southern Hemisphere English]]).

In contrast, speakers of rhotic dialects, such as those of Scotland, Ireland, and most of North America (except in some of the [[Northeastern United States]] and [[Southern United States]]), always pronounce an {{IPA|/r/}} in ''tuner'' and never in ''tuna'' so that the two always sound distinct, even when pronounced in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1970|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trudgill|Gordon|2006|p=236}} lists the distribution of rhotic and non-rhotic dialects more explicitly.&lt;/ref&gt; Hints of non-rhoticity go back as early as the 15th century, and the feature was common (at least in [[London]]) by the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gick|1999|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linking R==
In many non-rhotic accents, words historically ending in {{IPA|/r/}} (as evidenced by an {{angbr|r}} in the spelling) may be pronounced with {{IPA|/r/}} when they are closely followed by another morpheme beginning with a vowel sound. So ''tuner amp'' may be pronounced {{IPA|[ˈtjuːnə'''r''' æmp]}}.{{refn|group=nb|It is arguable whether or not the {{IPA|/r/}} is phonetically part of the onset of the following word (a form of [[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]) {{Harvcoltxt|Gick|1999|p=31}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Vennemann|1972|p=216}}, for example, argues that linking R is an instance of resyllabifying the rhotic phoneme.  On the other hand, Wells would argue that it is not necessarily in the onset of the following syllable.}} This is the case in such accents even though ''tuner'' would not otherwise be pronounced with an {{IPA|/r/}}. Here, "closely" means the following word must be in the same [[prosodic unit]] (that is, not separated by a [[pausa]]). This phenomenon is known as '''linking R'''. Not all non-rhotic varieties feature linking R. A notable non-rhotic accent that does not have linking R is [[Southern American English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gick|1999|p=31}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Kurath|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|IntrusiveR}}Intrusive R==
The phenomenon of '''intrusive R''' is an overgeneralizing reinterpretation&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hartmann|Zerbian|2009|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hock|2009|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; of linking R into an r-insertion rule that affects any word that ends in the non-high vowels {{IPA|/ə/}}, {{IPA|/ɪə/}}, {{IPA|/ɑː/}}, or {{IPA|/ɔː/}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1970|p=241}}. In [[Cockney]], {{IPA|/aʊ/}} is another vowel affected&lt;/ref&gt; when such a word is closely followed by another word beginning in a vowel sound, an {{IPA|/r/}} is inserted between them, even when no final {{IPA|/r/}} was historically present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gick|1999|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the phrase ''bacteria in it'' would be pronounced {{IPA|/bækˈtɪəriərˌɪnɪt/}}.  The [[epenthetic]] {{IPA|/r/}} can be inserted to prevent [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], two consecutive vowel sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1970|p=241}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Gimson|1962|p=204}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Jones|1966|pp=§§ 357–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recognisable examples are the [[Beatles]] singing: "''I saw-'''r'''-a film today, oh boy''" in the song "[[A Day in the Life]]", from their 1967 ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album, in the song "[[Champagne Supernova]]" by [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]: "''supernova-'''r'''-in the sky''", at the Sanctus in the Catholic Mass: "''Hosanna-'''r'''-in the highest''" and in the phrases, "''Law-'''r'''-and order''" and ''"Victoria-'''r'''-and Albert Museum"''. This is now common enough in parts of [[England]] that, by 1997, the linguist [[John C. Wells]] considered it objectively part of [[Received Pronunciation]], though he noted that it was still stigmatized as an incorrect pronunciation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/rphappened.htm|title=Whatever happened to Received Pronunciation?|first=J.C.|last=Wells|date=2002-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is or was in some other standardized non-rhotic accents. Wells writes that at least in RP, "linking {{IPA|/r/}} and intrusive {{IPA|/r/}} are distinct only historically and orthographically".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just like linking R, intrusive R may also occur between a root morpheme and certain [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffixes]], such as ''draw(r)ing'', ''withdraw(r)al'' or ''[[Kafka]](r)esque''.

Rhotic dialects do not feature intrusive R. A rhotic speaker may use alternative strategies to prevent the [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], such as the insertion of a [[glottal stop]] to clarify the boundary between the two words. Varieties that feature linking R but not intrusive R (that is, ''tuna oil'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈtjuːnə (ʔ)ɔɪl]}}), show a clear phonemic distinction between words with and without {{IPA|/r/}} in the syllable coda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gick|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speakers intrude an R at the end of a word even when there is no vowel following. An example is U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] (who is from [[Texan English|Texas]]) speaking to [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] director Michael Brown in 2005: "The FEMA-'''R''' director's working 24/7".&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050902-2.html President Arrives in Alabama, Briefed on Hurricane Katrina], ''White House archives'', 2 Sept 2005. Retrieved Jul 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be6tunbRcs8 (video – at 1:20)], ''[[CNN]]'', 2 Sept 2005. Retrieved Jul 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Variability and change in received pronunciation: a study of six phonological variables in the speech of television newsreaders
|first=Bente Rebecca 
|last=Hannissdal
|location=Leeds
|year=2006
|publisher=University of Bergen
|url=https://bora.uib.no/bitstream/1956/2335/1/Dr.Avh.Bente%20Hannisdal.pdf
|pages=158–182
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; examined the pronunciation of 30 British newsreaders on nationally broadcast newscasts around the turn of the 21st century speaking what was judged to be "mainstream RP".  The data used in the study consisted mostly of the newsreaders reading from prepared scripts, but also included some more informal interview segments. It was found that all the newsreaders used some linking R and 90% (27 of 30) used some intrusive R.

Overall, linking R was used in 59.8% of possible sites and intrusive R was used in 32.6% of possible sites.  The factors influencing the use of both linking and intrusive R were found to be the same.  Factors favouring the use of R-sandhi included adjacency to short words; adjacency to grammatical or non-lexical words; and informal style (interview rather than a prepared script). Factors disfavouring the use of R-sandhi included adjacency to proper names; occurrence immediately before a stressed syllable; the presence of another /r/ in the vicinity; and more formal style (prepared script rather than interview).  The following factors were proposed as accounting for the difference between the frequency of linking and intrusive R:
* overt stigmatization of intrusive R
* the speakers being professional newsreaders and thus, presumably, speech-conscious professionals
* the speakers (in most cases) reading from a written script, making the orthographic distinction between linking and intrusive R extremely salient
* the disparity between the large number of short, grammatical words that end in possible linking R (e.g. "for", "or", "are", etc.) and the absence of such words that end in possible intrusive R.

He was born in [[Qingtian County]] (present-day [[Wencheng County]], [[Wenzhou]], [[Zhejiang]]). He served as a key advisor to [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor)]], the founder of the Ming dynasty, in the latter's struggle to overthrow the Yuan dynasty and unify China under his rule.&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;Windridge, Charles. [1999] (2003) Tong Sing The Chinese Book of Wisdom. Kyle Cathie Limited. {{ISBN|0-7607-4535-8}}. pg 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu is also known for his prophecies and has been described as the "Divine Chinese [[Nostradamus]]".&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; He and [[Jiao Yu]] co-edited the military treatise known as the ''[[Huolongjing]]'' (''Fire Dragon Manual'').

==Career==
Liu served Zhu Yuanzhang in his rebellion against the [[Mongol people|Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]] in China, which had ruled since the conquest of the [[Southern Song dynasty]] in 1279. He dabbled in many fields of statecraft, [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], scholarly works, and technology. His philosophical outlook was that of a skeptical naturalist, and he became interested in [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], calendrical science, magnetism, and [[fengshui]]. He was known to be a friendly associate of the mathematician and alchemist [[Zhao Yuqin]], and collaborated with the contemporary general and scholar [[Jiao Yu]] to edit and compile the military-technology treatise of the ''[[Huolongjing]]'', which outlined the use of various [[gunpowder]] weapons. He was very interested in the latter, and once said that "thunder is like fire shot from a cannon".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 25"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early service under the Yuan dynasty===
Liu sat for the [[imperial examination]] and obtained the position of a ''[[Jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]]'' (successful candidate) in the final years of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. He spent much of his early career attempting to save the Yuan dynasty from collapse. He served the Yuan dynasty as an official for 25 years, gaining a reputation for integrity and honesty, and became known as a distinguished scholar and strategist.&lt;ref name="Xin2"&gt;"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/st/2005-05/25/content_3000293_1.htm Xinhuanet.com]." ''劉伯溫是被神化了嗎？. Page 2.'' Retrieved on 2008-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1348, he was appointed to a military position and assigned to put down a southern rebellion against the dynasty. The leader of the rebellion attempted to save himself by offering Liu a bribe. When Liu refused, the rebel went to Beijing and succeeded in bribing his way into favour there.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, Thomas. (2005) ''Mastering the Art of War'', Shambhala Publications, Inc. pp. 101–102. {{ISBN|1-59030-264-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the secessionist had bribed his way into the regime's favour, he was given a public office and a salary. Liu's relationship with the Yuan government deteriorated after this event. He attempted to resign twice, in 1349 and 1352. He was demoted in 1358, and finally left service to retire in his ancestral homeland. In 1360, Liu was introduced to [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], a former leader of a radical [[White Lotus]] rebellion who was then the leader of a broad anti-Yuan rebellion.&lt;ref name="Xin2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, Thomas. (2005) ''Mastering the Art of War'', Shambhala Publications, Inc. p. 102. {{ISBN|1-59030-264-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service to Zhu Yuanzhang===
Liu served not only in the administration of [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], but also in many battles as a commanding officer on land and water, leading the early Ming naval forces. Zhu Yuanzhang placed Liu in charge of the campaign to conquer all of [[Zhejiang]] from Yuan forces.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 232"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu was also responsible for military ventures against opposing Chinese rebel groups, as well as the ''[[wokou]]''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 232"/&gt; His forces owed much of their success to the use of the medieval Chinese firearm known as the [[fire lance]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 232"/&gt; It was during this period that he wrote the books ''Extraordinary Strategies of a Hundred Battles'' (''百戰奇略'') and ''Eighteen Strategies and Affairs'' (''時務十八策'').&lt;ref name="Xin1"&gt;"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/st/2005-05/25/content_3000293.htm Xinhuanet.com]." ''劉伯溫是被神化了嗎？. Page 1.'' Retrieved on 2008-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the rebellion, Zhu Yuanzhang only rarely relied on Liu to personally command his armies in the field, as he acquired other capable generals, including [[Xu Da]], [[Deng Yu]] and [[Chang Yuchun]]. Liu was most often consulted for his strategic advice during this period.&lt;ref name="ming" /&gt;

In 1368, after eight years of Liu's service, Zhu Yuanzhang unified China. When Zhu founded the [[Ming dynasty]] and became historically known as the [[Hongwu Emperor]], Liu was one of his most trusted advisors, but the relationship between Liu and the emperor eventually deteriorated in a manner similar to the way that Liu had become estranged from the Yuan government. In 1375, Liu rejected a man, [[Hu Weiyong]], for appointment to high office. Hu Weiyong later obtained an audience with the Hongwu Emperor and slandered Liu by telling the emperor that Liu was plotting to establish his own power. After convincing the emperor of Liu's treachery, Liu was ejected from office, and Hu Weiyong was promoted.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, Thomas. (2005) ''Mastering the Art of War'', Shambhala Publications, Inc. p. 103. {{ISBN|1-59030-264-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
The shock and shame of being groundlessly dismissed from office destroyed Liu's health, and he quickly died. Within five years of Liu's death, the man who had slandered Liu to achieve office was himself suspected of plotting against the Hongwu Emperor. In the subsequent orgy of the emperor's paranoid efforts to root out conspiracy, 30–40,000 people were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, Thomas. (2005) ''Mastering the Art of War'', Shambhala Publications, Inc. pp. 103–104. {{ISBN|1-59030-264-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise cause of Liu's death is considered uncertain by modern scholars. Some scholars believe that Liu was poisoned by the Hongwu Emperor himself, not because Liu failed his duty, but because the emperor was envious and even fearful of his knowledge and influence.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; Other sources have pointed out that the Hongwu Emperor did kill many people shortly after Liu lost his official position, but they are uncertain about whether Liu was part of this group.&lt;ref name="Xin3"&gt;"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/st/2005-05/25/content_3000293_2.htm Xinhuanet.com]."

==Prophecy==
Liu's most famous prophecy to Zhu Yuanzhang, written down in a lyrical style, is called the ''[[Shaobing Song]]'' (燒餅歌).&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tui"&gt;Ji, Liu. [2004] (2004) 燒餅歌與推背圖.

Retrieved on 2008-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is written in cryptic verse and is difficult to understand. Some people believe that the ''Shaobing Song'' has predicted future events in China, including the [[Tumu Crisis|1449 Mongol invasion]], and the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 founding of the Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt;

==Biographical works==
Liu's official biography is found in the 128th volume of the ''[[History of Ming]]'', which was written by [[Zhang Tingyu]] and others in the [[Qing dynasty]]. The author [[Chong Tai]] also wrote a biography on him.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 25"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3614">In mathematics, a '''factorisation''' of a '''free monoid''' is a sequence of subsets of words with the property that every word in the free monoid can be written as a concatenation of elements drawn from the subsets.  The Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem states that the [[Lyndon word]]s furnish a factorisation.  The Schützenberger theorem relates the definition in terms of a multiplicative property to an additive property.

Let ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; be the [[free monoid]] on an alphabet ''A''.  Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be a sequence of subsets of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; indexed by a [[total order|totally ordered]] index set ''I''.  A factorisation of a word ''w'' in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is an expression

:&lt;math&gt;w = x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \cdots x_{i_n} \  &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;x_{i_j} \in X_{i_j}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i_1 \ge i_2 \ge \ldots \ge i_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem==
A ''Lyndon word'' over a totally ordered alphabet ''A'' is a word which is [[Lexicographic order|lexicographically]] less than all its rotations.&lt;ref name=L64&gt;Lothaire (1997) p.64&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem''' states that every string may be formed in a unique way by concatenating a non-increasing sequence of Lyndon words.  Hence taking ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the singleton set {''l''} for each Lyndon word ''l'', with the index set ''L'' of Lyndon words ordered lexicographically, we obtain a factorisation of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=L67&gt;Lothaire (1997) p.67&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a factorisation can be found in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Duval | first = Jean-Pierre | doi = 10.1016/0196-6774(83)90017-2 | issue = 4
 | journal = Journal of Algorithms | pages = 363–381 | title = Factorizing words over an ordered alphabet | volume = 4 | year = 1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bisection==
A '''bisection''' of a free monoid is a factorisation with just two classes ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=L68&gt;Lothaire (1997) p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
:''A'' = {''a'',''b''}, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''b''}, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {''a''}.

If ''X'', ''Y'' are disjoint sets of non-empty words, then (''X'',''Y'') is a bisection of ''A''* if and only if&lt;ref name=L69&gt;Lothaire (1997) p.69&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;YX \cup A = X \cup Y \ . &lt;/math&gt;

As a consequence, for any partition ''P'' , ''Q'' of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; there is a unique bisection (''X'',''Y'') with ''X'' a subset of ''P'' and ''Y'' a subset of ''Q''.&lt;ref name=L71&gt;Lothaire (1997) p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schützenberger theorem==
This theorem states that a sequence ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of subsets of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; forms a factorisation if and only if two of the following three statements holds:
* Every element of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; has at least one expression in the required form;
* Every element of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; has at most one expression in the required form;
* Each conjugate class ''C'' meets just one of the monoids ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;* and the elements of ''C'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are conjugate in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=L92&gt;Lothaire (1997) p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16192">{{about|the formal terminology in logic|causal meanings of the terms|Causality|the concepts in statistics|Sufficient statistic}}In [[logic]], '''necessity''' and '''sufficiency''' are terms used to describe a [[material conditional|conditional]] or implicational relationship between [[Statement (logic)|statements]]. For example, in the conditional statement "If P then Q", we say that "Q is '''necessary''' for P" because P cannot be true unless Q is true. Similarly, we say that "P is '''sufficient''' for Q" because P being true always implies that Q is true, but P not being true does not always imply that Q is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proofs and Fundamentals: A First Course in Abstract Mathematics|last=Bloch|first=Ethan D.|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4419-7126-5|location=|pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The assertion that a statement is a "necessary ''and'' sufficient" condition of another means that the former statement is true [[if and only if]] the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false.&lt;ref name=betz&gt;{{cite book|last=Betz|first=Frederick|title=Managing Science: Methodology and Organization of Research|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-7487-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Manktelow&gt;{{cite book|last=Manktelow|first=K.

In [[ordinary English]], "necessary" and "sufficient" indicate relations between conditions or states of affairs, not statements. Being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother.

==Definitions==

In the conditional statement, "if ''S'', then ''N''", the expression represented by ''S'' is called the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and the expression represented by ''N'' is called the [[consequent]]. This conditional statement may be written in many equivalent ways, for instance, "''N'' if ''S''", "''S'' only if ''N''", "''S'' implies ''N''", "''N'' is implied by ''S''", {{math|''S'' → ''N''}} , {{math|''S'' ⇒ ''N''}}, or "''N'' whenever ''S''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=Sets, Functions and Logic / An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|edition=3rd|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58488-449-1|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the above situation, we also say that ''N'' is a '''necessary''' condition for ''S''. In common language this is saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement, then the consequent ''N'' must be true if ''S'' may at all be true (see "[[truth table]]" immediately below). Phrased differently, the antecedent ''S'' cannot be true without ''N'' being true. For example, in order for someone to be called '''''S'''''ocrates, it is necessary for that someone to be '''''N'''''amed.

We also say that ''S'' is a '''sufficient''' condition for ''N''. Consider the truth table again. If the conditional statement is true, then if ''S'' is true, ''N'' must be true; whereas if the conditional statement is true and N is true, then S may be true or  be false. In common terms, "''S'' guarantees ''N''". Continuing the example, knowing that someone is called '''''S'''''ocrates is sufficient to know that someone has a '''''N'''''ame.

A '''''necessary and sufficient''''' condition requires that both of the implications &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N \Rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; (which can also be written as &lt;math&gt;S \Leftarrow N&lt;/math&gt;)  hold. From the first of these we see that ''S'' is a sufficient condition for ''N'', and from the second that ''S'' is a necessary condition for ''N''. This is expressed as "''S'' is necessary and sufficient for ''N'' ", "''S'' [[if and only if]] ''N'' ", or &lt;math&gt;S \Leftrightarrow N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Necessity==

[[File:Solar eclipse 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The sun being above the horizon is a necessary condition for direct sunlight; but it is not a sufficient condition, as something else may be casting a shadow, e.g., the moon in the case of an [[solar eclipse|eclipse]].]]

The assertion that ''Q'' is necessary for ''P'' is colloquially equivalent to "''P'' cannot be true unless ''Q'' is true" or "if Q is false, then P is false". By [[contraposition]], this is the same thing as "whenever ''P'' is true, so is ''Q''".

The logical relation between ''P'' and ''Q'' is expressed as "if ''P'', then ''Q''" and denoted "''P'' ⇒ ''Q''" (''P'' [[Logical consequence|implies]] ''Q''). It may also be expressed as any of "''P'' only if ''Q''", "''Q'', if ''P''", "''Q'' whenever ''P''", and "''Q'' when ''P''". One often finds, in mathematical prose for instance, several necessary conditions that, taken together, constitute a sufficient condition, as shown in Example 5.

;Example 1: For it to be true that "John is a bachelor", it is necessary that it be also true that he is
:# unmarried,
:# male,
:# adult,
:since to state "John is a bachelor" implies John has each of those three additional [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]].

;Example 2: For the whole numbers greater than two, being odd is necessary to being prime, since two is the only whole number that is both even and prime.

;Example 3: Consider thunder, the sound caused by lightning. We say that thunder is necessary for lightning, since lightning never occurs without thunder. Whenever there's lightning, there's thunder. The thunder ''does not cause'' the lightning (since lightning causes thunder), but because lightning always comes with thunder, we say that thunder is necessary for lightning. (That is, in its formal sense, necessity doesn't imply causality.)

;Example 4: Being at least 30 years old is necessary for serving in the U.S. Senate.  If you are under 30 years old, then it is impossible for you to be a senator.  That is, if you are a senator, it follows that you are at least 30 years old.

;Example 5: In [[algebra]], for some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; to form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], it is necessary that &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; be [[associative]].  It is also necessary that ''S'' include a special element ''e'' such that for every ''x'' in ''S'' it is the case that ''e'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' and ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''e'' both equal ''x''.  It is also necessary that for every ''x'' in ''S'' there exist a corresponding element ''x'' "such that both ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' " and ''x''" &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' equal the special element ''e''.  None of these three necessary conditions by itself is sufficient, but the [[conjunction (logic)|conjunction]] of the three is.

==Sufficiency==

[[File:ICE 3 Fahlenbach.jpg|thumb|right|200px|That a train runs on schedule can be a sufficient condition for arriving on time (if one boards the train and it departs on time, then one will arrive on time); but it is not always a necessary condition, since there are other ways to travel (if the train does not run to time, one could still arrive on time through other means of transport).]]

If ''P'' is sufficient for ''Q'', then knowing ''P'' to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that ''Q'' is true; however, knowing ''P'' to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that ''Q'' is false.

The logical relation is, as before, expressed as "if ''P'', then ''Q''" or "''P'' ⇒ ''Q''". This can also be expressed as "''P'' only if ''Q''", "''P'' implies ''Q''" or several other variants. It may be the case that several sufficient conditions, when taken together, constitute a single necessary condition, as illustrated in example 5.

;Example 1: "John is a king" implies that John is male. So knowing that it is true that John is a king is sufficient to know that he is a male.

;Example 2: A number's being divisible by 4 is sufficient (but not necessary) for its being even, but being divisible by 2 is both sufficient and necessary.

;Example 3: An occurrence of thunder is a sufficient condition for the occurrence of lightning in the sense that hearing thunder, and unambiguously recognizing it as such, justifies concluding that there has been a lightning bolt.

;Example 4: If the U.S. Congress passes a bill, the president's signature of the bill is sufficient to make it law. Note that the case whereby the president did not sign the bill, e.g. through exercising a presidential [[veto#United States|veto]], does not mean that the bill has not become law (it could still have become law through a congressional [[veto override|override]]).

;Example 5: That the center of a [[playing card]] should be marked with a single large spade (♠) is sufficient for the card to be an ace.  Three other sufficient conditions are that the center of the card be marked with a diamond (♦), heart (♥), or club (♣), respectively.  None of these conditions is necessary to the card's being an ace, but their [[disjunction]] is, since no card can be an ace without fulfilling at least (in fact, exactly) one of the conditions.

==Relationship between necessity and sufficiency==
[[File:Set intersection.svg|thumb|260 px|Being in the purple region is sufficient for being in A, but not necessary. Being in A is necessary for being in the purple region, but not sufficient. Being in A and being in B is necessary and sufficient for being in the purple region.]]

A condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other.  For instance, ''being a [[mammal]]'' (''N'') is necessary but not sufficient to ''being human'' (''S''), and that a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''is rational'' (''S'') is sufficient but not necessary to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''being a [[real number]]'' (''N'') (since there are real numbers that are not rational).

A condition can be both necessary and sufficient. For example, at present, "today is the [[Fourth of July]]" is a necessary and sufficient condition for "today is [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the [[United States]]".  Similarly, a necessary and sufficient condition for [[Inverse matrix|invertibility]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''M'' is that ''M'' has a nonzero [[determinant]].

Mathematically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to one another.  For any statements ''S'' and ''N'', the assertion that "''N'' is necessary for ''S''" is equivalent to the assertion that "''S'' is sufficient for ''N''". Another facet of this duality is that, as illustrated above, conjunctions (using "and") of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency, while disjunctions (using "or") of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity.  For a third facet, identify every mathematical [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] ''N'' with the set ''T''(''N'') of objects, events, or statements for which ''N'' holds true; then asserting the necessity of ''N'' for ''S'' is equivalent to claiming that ''T''(''N'') is a [[superset]] of ''T''(''S''), while asserting the sufficiency of ''S'' for ''N'' is equivalent to claiming that ''T''(''S'') is a [[subset]] of ''T''(''N'').

==Simultaneous necessity and sufficiency==
{{See also|Material equivalence}}

To say that ''P'' is necessary and sufficient for ''Q'' is to say two things:
# that ''P'' is necessary for ''Q'',  &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, and that ''P'' is sufficient for ''Q'', &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;.  
# equivalently, it may be understood to say that ''P'' and ''Q'' is necessary for the other, &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q \land Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, which can also be stated as each ''is sufficient for'' or ''implies'' the other.

One may summarize any, and thus all, of these cases by the statement "''P'' [[if and only if]] ''Q''", which is denoted by &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, whereas cases tell us that &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is identical to &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q \land Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in [[graph theory]] a graph ''G'' is called [[Bipartite graph|bipartite]] if it is possible to assign to each of its vertices the color ''black'' or ''white'' in such a way that every edge of ''G'' has one endpoint of each color.  And for any graph to be bipartite, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]].  Thus, discovering whether a graph has any odd cycles tells one whether it is bipartite and conversely.  A philosopher&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intensional/ Stanford University primer, 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; might characterize this state of affairs thus: "Although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in [[intension]], they have identical [[extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref&gt;"Meanings, in this sense, are often called ''intensions'', and things designated, ''extensions''. Contexts in which extension is all that matters are, naturally, called ''extensional'', while contexts in which extension is not enough are ''intensional''. Mathematics is typically extensional throughout." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intensional/ Stanford University primer, 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, theorems are often stated in the form "''P'' is true if and only if ''Q'' is true". Their proofs normally first prove sufficiency, e.g. &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;. Secondly, the opposite is proven, &lt;math&gt;Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;
# either directly, assuming ''Q'' is true and demonstrating that the Q circle is located within P, or 
# [[Proof by contrapositive|contrapositively]], that is demonstrating that stepping outside circle of P, we fall out the ''Q'': ''assuming not P, not Q results''.

This proves that the circles for Q and P match on the Venn diagrams above.

Because, as explained in previous section, necessity of one for the other is equivalent to sufficiency of the other for the first one, e.g. &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is [[Logical equivalence|equivalent to]] &lt;math&gt;Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, if ''P'' is necessary and sufficient for ''Q'', then ''Q'' is necessary and sufficient for ''P''. We can write &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q \equiv Q \Leftrightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; and say that the statements "''P'' is true [[if and only if]] ''Q'', is true" and "''Q'' is true if and only if ''P'' is true" are equivalent.

'''Nominal TAM''' is the indication of [[tense–aspect–mood]] by [[inflection|inflecting]] a noun, rather than a verb. In ''clausal nominal TAM'', the noun indicates TAM information about the [[clause]] (as opposed to the noun phrase).

Whether or not a particular language can best be understood as having clausal nominal TAM can be controversial, and there are various borderline cases. A language that can indicate tense by attaching a verbal [[clitic]] to a noun (such as the -'''ll'' clitic in English) is not generally regarded as using nominal TAM.

== Examples of nominal TAM ==

=== Clausal nominal TAM ===

Various languages have been shown to have clausal nominal TAM.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Nordlinger and Louisa Sadler, "Tense as a Nominal Category", 2000. {{cite web |url=http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/LFG/5/lfg00nordlinger-sadler.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816155125/http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/LFG/5/lfg00nordlinger-sadler.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language]] [[Supyire language|Supyire]], the form of the first person and second pronouns reflects whether the clause has declarative or non-declarative mood. In the [[Gǀui dialect|/Gui language]] of Botswana, subject pronouns reflect the imperative or non-imperative mood of the clause (while the verb itself does not). In the [[Chamicuro language]] of Peru, the definite article accompanying the subject or object of a clause indicates either past or non-past tense. In the [[Pitta Pitta language]] of Australia, the mandatory case marking system differs depending on the tense of the clause. Other languages exhibiting clausal nominal TAM include [[Lardil language|Lardil]] (Australia), Gurnu (Australia), [[Dii languages|Yag Dii]] (Cameroon), [[Coptic language#Sahidic|Sahidic Coptic]] (Egypt), [[Gusilay language|Gusiilay]] (Niger-Congo), [[Iaai language|Iai]] (Oceania), [[Tigak language|Tigak]] (Oceania), and [[Guaymí language|Guaymi]] (Panama and Costa Rica).

=== Non-clausal nominal TAM ===

In the [[Guarani language]] of Paraguay, nouns can optionally take several different past and future markers to express ideas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guasch|first=P. Antonio|title=El Idioma Guarani: Gramatica y Antologia de Prosa y Verso|year=1956|publisher=Casa America|location=Asuncion|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as "our old house (the one we no longer live in)", "the abandoned car", "what was once a bridge", "bride-to-be" or even "my ex-future-wife," or rather, "the woman who at one point was going to be my wife."

== Related grammatical phenomena ==

=== Verbal clitics ===

Although verbal clitics such as -'''ll'' in English are attached to nouns and indicate TAM information, they are not really examples of nominal TAM because they are [[clitic]]s rather than [[inflection]]s and therefore not part of the noun at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Huddleston]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum]], ''[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is easily seen in sentences where the clitic is attached to another part of speech, such as "''The one you want'll be in the shed''".

Another way to tell the difference is to consider the following hypothetical dialogue:
* "''I thought you said that she read the book.''"
* "''No, I said she '''will''' read the book.''" ['''as opposed to'''] "''No, I said '''she'll''' read the book.''" ['''wrong in this context''']
The speaker cannot emphasise the future time by placing voice stress on ''she'll'', and so instead uses the expanded phrase ''she will''. This is characteristic of clitics as opposed to inflections (i.e. clitics cannot be emphasised by placing voice stress on the word to which they are attached).

The significance of this can be seen by comparison with a second hypothetical dialogue, using the English negative suffix -''n't'' (which is best understood as an inflection rather than a clitic):
* "''I thought you said that it is a good book.''"
* "''No, I said it is '''not''' a good book.''" ['''or'''] "''No, I said it '''isn't''' a good book.''" ['''equally correct''']
In this case the speaker could choose to say '''isn't''' rather than '''is not'''. Even though the stress then falls on the syllable ''IS'', the meaning of the sentence is understood as emphasising the ''NOT''. This indicates that ''isn't'' is one inflected word rather than a word with a clitic attached.

'''Paio Soares de Taveirós''' or ''Paay Soarez de Taveiroos'' seems to have been a minor [[Galicia, Spain|Galician]] nobleman and [[troubadour]] active during the second and third decades of the 13th century. He was a brother of the troubadour [[Pêro Velho de Taveirós]]. Of his works, six ''[[cantiga de amor|cantigas de amor]]'', three ''[[cantiga de amigo|cantigas de amigo]]'', and two ''[[tenso]]s'' (one with [[Martim Soares]] and one with his brother) survive.

He may have been one of the earliest authors in [[Galician-Portuguese lyric]], and his ''[[Cantiga da Garvaia]]'', a satiric ''cantiga de amor'' (or  ''[[cantiga d'escarnho|cantiga de escárnio]]'') is one of the most famous poems in the corpus.

[[File:Oxford University Press Museum. (31432106471).jpg|thumb|A paste-up for a poem from an edition of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', held in the [[Oxford University Press]] museum.]]
'''Paste up''' refers to a method of creating or laying out publication pages that predates the use of the now-standard computerized page design [[desktop publishing]] programs. Completed, or [[camera-ready]], pages are known as mechanicals or mechanical art. In the [[offset lithography]] process, the mechanicals would  be photographed with a [[stat camera]] to create a same-size film negative for each [[offset printing|printing plate]] required.

Paste up relied on [[phototypesetting]], a process that would generate "cold type" on photographic paper that usually took the form of long columns of text. These printouts were often a single [[column]] in a scroll of narrow (3-inch or 4-inch) paper that was as deep as the length of the story.

A professional known variously as a paste-up artist, [[page layout|layout]] artist, mechanical artist, [[production artist]], or compositor would cut the type into sections and arrange it carefully across multiple columns. For example, a 15 inch strip could be cut into 3 5-inch sections. Headlines and other typographic elements were often created and supplied separately by the typesetter, leaving it to the paste up artist to determine their final position on the page.

Adhesive was then applied to the back side of these strips, either by applying [[rubber cement]] with a brush or passing them through a machine that would apply a [[wax]] [[adhesive]]. The adhesives were intentionally made semi-permanent, allowing the strips to be removed and moved around the layout if it needed to be changed. The strips would be adhered to a board, usually a stiff white paper on which the artist would draw the publication's margins and columns, either lightly in pencil or in non-photographic blue ink, a light [[cyan]] color that would be ignored by the orthochromatic film used to make printing plates in [[offset lithography]]. For magazines, newspapers, and other recurring projects, often the boards would be pre-printed in this color.

Other camera-ready materials like [[photostat]]s and [[line art]] would also be prepared with adhesive and attached to the boards. Continuous-tone photographs would need [[halftoning]], which would require black paper or red film (which photo-imaged the same as black) to be trimmed and placed on the board in place of the image; in the process of creating the negative film for the printing plates, the solid black area would create a clear spot on the negative, called a window. The photographs would be converted to halftone film separately and then positioned in this window to complete the page (although this process was typically performed by a different worker, known as a negative "stripper").

Once a page was complete, the board would be attached to an easel and photographed in order to create a [[Negative (photography)|negative]], which was then used to make a [[offset printing|printing plate]].

Paste up was preceded by [[hot type]] and [[movable type|cold type]] technologies. Starting in the 1990s, many newspapers started doing away with paste up, switching to desktop publishing software that allows pages to be designed completely on a computer. Such software includes [[QuarkXPress]], [[PageMaker]] and [[InDesign]].

The '''Persian Wikipedia''' ({{lang-fa|{{#property:P1448}}}}, [[Romanize]]d as ''Wikipediā, Dānešnāme-ye Āzād  /  "Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia"'') is the [[Persian language]] version of [[Wikipedia]], pronounced "Wikipedia (Wikipediā)". The Persian version of Wikipedia was started in December 2003. It passed 1,000 articles on December 16, 2004 and 200,000 articles on July 10, 2012. [[Roozbeh Pournader]] is the project's first [[system operator]], developer and bureaucrat.

==Number of articles==
In January 2013, close to 50,000 new articles were added within a month. A few days later, on 19 February 2013, the Persian Wikipedia reached 300,000 articles, ranking it 18th among all Wikipedias based on number of articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias#100_000.2B_articles List of Wikipedias]. Wikimedia.org. 19 February 2013. Retrieved 19 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

It currently has '''{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|fa|N}}''' articles, making it the '''17th''' largest [[Wikipedia]] by article count.

History of articles number:

==Censorship==
In a November 2013 report published by the [[Center for Global Communication Studies]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], researchers Collin Anderson and Nima Nazeri scanned 800,000 Persian language Wikipedia articles and found that the Iranian government blocks 963 of these pages. According to the authors, "Censors repeatedly targeted Wikipedia pages about government rivals, minority religious beliefs, and criticisms of the state, officials, and the police. Just under half of the blocked Wiki-pages are biographies, including pages about individuals the authorities have allegedly detained or killed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.global.asc.upenn.edu/fileLibrary/PDFs/CItation_Filtered_Wikipedia_Report_11_5_2013-2.pdf |title=Citation Filtered: Iran's Censorship of Wikipedia |last1=Anderson |first1=Colin |last2=Nazeri |first2=Nima |date=7 November 2013 |publisher=Center for Global Communication Studies (University of Pennsylvania) |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson said that Persian Wikipedia, as a microcosm of the Iranian internet, is a "useful place to uncover the types of online content forbidden and an excellent template to identify keyword blocking themes and filtering rules that apply across the greater internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 November 2013 |title=How Iran Uses Wikipedia To Censor The Internet |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/how-iran-uses-wikipedia-to-censor-the-internet |agency=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pramod Ranjan was born on 22 February 1980 in [[Patna]], [[Bihar]]. He attended government primary and secondary schools in [[Nalanda district]]. Ranjan did [[M.Phil.]] (Social concerns of Phaniswarnath Renu’s journalism) and [[Ph.D]] Scholar at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|JNU]], [[New Delhi]] where he wrote dissertations titled "Social Concerns of Phaniswarath Renu’s Journalism" and "The Question of Liberation from Caste in Novels by Non-Dwij Hindi Authors".

==Career in journalism==
===Literary and cultural contributions===
Pramod Ranjan’s journalistic focus has been the rights of the [[Backward Classes|backward classes]], [[Adivasi|Adivasis]], [[Dalit|Dalits]] and other oppressed communities. He has tried to bring the discourse on OBC-Dalit issues from the margins of [[Hindi literature]] to the mainstream. He is credited with the reinterpretation of many [[Hindu]] legends from the Bahujan angle. He has also contributed to the Bahujan cultural movement by exposing the lies fed to the media regarding the Mahishasur Martyrdom Day celebrations organized by [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|JNU]] students. He showed how the [[RSS]] tried to discredit this movement by attributing it to the organizations of the Far Left and terming it [[anti-national]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pramod Ranjan - Jawaharlal Nehru University |url=https://jnu.academia.edu/PramodRanjan|work=[[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|JNU]]|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=एक यायावर पत्रकार|url=http://www.streekaal.com/2014/06/personality-journalist.html|accessdate=4 March 2017|publisher=Streekaal A Feminist Magazine|language=[[Hindi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resurrecting Mahisasur: He Sat In A Room, Without A Wink Of Sleep – And The BJP Got Cornered |url=http://www.indiaresists.com/mahisasur-smriti-irani-forward-press-pramod-ranjan/|work=IndiaResists|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23523">'''Radio homogenization''' is a trend towards similar programming within [[Radio broadcasting|broadcast radio]] in the [[United States]]. It is partially a result of the [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomeration]] of radio companies, particularly after the enactment of the now controversial [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]]. The bill relaxed regulations that limited ownership of radio stations, and subsequently their ownership became greatly consolidated. A number of the resulting large radio companies have been accused of broadcasting less new music, emulating a same-ness on the airwaves. Consolidation has allowed bigger companies to transition to a more [[profitable]] nationalized [[target marketing]] model, forcing local [[independent radio]] stations to adjust to the financial realities of their competitors. Corporate interests tend to favor the cost benefits of efficiency, however consolidation is reported to have significant effects on overall radio programming in the US.

==Background of corporate consolidation==

===Deregulation===
The [[1996 Telecommunications Act]] removed all national and local restrictions on national ownership that specified the number of stations one company could own in a set market. Before 1996, a company was prohibited from owning more than 40 stations, and from owning more than two [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and two [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations in one market. The bill covered a wide range of formats and was the first time the Internet was included in broadcasting and spectrum allotment.&lt;ref name=Polgreen /&gt;

The federal government has regulated the extent of ownership for radio stations since the [[1934 Communications Act]].&lt;ref name=Scherzinger /&gt; The policy was based on the notion that the airwaves were accessible to the public and therefor had an accompanying public trust.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boehlert|first1=Eric|title=Radio's big bully|url=http://www.salon.com/2001/04/30/clear_channel/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) began to relax these limitations.&lt;ref name=FMC /&gt;

[[Lydia Polgreen]]'s research indicates that the 1996 Telecommunications Act was one of the most lobbied bills in history. Media interests spent $34 million on campaign contributions for the 1995–96 election cycle – nearly 40% more than the previous election.&lt;ref name=Polgreen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polgreen|first1=Lydia|title=The Death of 'Local Radio' |journal=Washington Monthly|date=1 Apr 1999|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Scherzinger]] claims the public was mostly uninformed of potential consequences, as "the media covered the Telecommunications Act as a business technicality instead of a public policy story," assuring [[deregulation]] would increase competition and generate high-paying jobs.&lt;ref name=Scherzinger /&gt; There was no discernible public debate.

Since deregulation in 1996, more than a third of all US radio stations have been bought and sold. Polgreen indicates that in the year following the legislation alone, 2045 radio stations were sold – a net value of $13.6 billion. Of the 4992 total stations across 268 set radio markets, almost half are now owned by a company owning three or more stations in the same market.&lt;ref name=Polgreen /&gt; The [[Future of Music Coalition]] reported the number of stations owned by the ten largest companies increased by roughly fifteen times between 1985 and 2005.&lt;ref name=FMC /&gt; [[Robert F. X. Sillerman]], Chairman of SFX Broadcasting, noted that consolidation also helps spread overhead costs around, and even adding a second station can cut costs.&lt;ref name=Antitrust /&gt; Consolidation doesn't necessarily mean less stations, merely less owners.

===Clear Channel===
{{see also|iHeartRadio}}

Two companies in particular, [[Clear Channel]] and the Infinity Broadcasting unit of [[Viacom]], own roughly half the nation's airwaves.&lt;ref name=Scherzinger /&gt; Clear Channel grew from 40 stations to 1,240 stations in seven years (30 times more than congressional regulation previously allowed) .&lt;ref name="FMC DeReg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiCola|first1=Peter|last2=Thomson|first2=Kristin|title=Radio Deregulation: Has it Served Musicians and Citizens?|url=https://www.futureofmusic.org/article/research/radio-deregulation-has-it-served-musicians-and-citizens|website=Future of Music|publisher=FMC|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their aggressive acquisitions have gained them enemies as well as supporters, but their ownership of 247 of the nation's 250 largest radio markets and their domination of the Top 40 format makes them undeniably a significant player in the music industry.&lt;ref name=Salon /&gt;

After 42 years, the country's largest radio broadcaster switched its name to [[iHeartRadio|iHeartRadio Inc.]] Though most of their revenue still comes from [[radio ad|advertising]] on its airwaves, iHeartRadio only accounts for 10% of total listening for the company. Clear Channel has built the iHeartRadio brand beyond the Internet (see: [[iHeartRadio Festival]], [[Jingle Ball Tour 2014|Jingle Ball]], Pool Party, [[iHeartRadio Music Festival|iHeartRadio Music Awards]]). After the company's concert promotion division spun off in 2005, it ditched the Clear Channel name in favor of [[Live Nation]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karp|first1=Hannah|title=Clear Channel Gets a New Name|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/09/16/clear-channel-gets-a-new-name/|accessdate=2 May 2015|agency=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a general trend of [[Concentration of media ownership|Consolidation of Media Ownership]], where corporate interests take precedence over the artistic integrity of the content. An analysis of a wide range of music professionals by [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] illustrates this is especially true of the music industry.&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldburg|first1=Danny|title=The "Corporatization" of the Music Industry|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/perfect/corp.html|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recorded music===
According to Martin Scherzinger, "[[recorded music]] is the most concentrated global media market today."&lt;ref name=Scherzinger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scherzinger|first1=Martin|title=Music, Corporate Power, Andunending War|journal=Cultural Critique|date=2005|volume=60|page=23|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v060/60.1scherzinger.html|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he wrote this in 2005, six leading firms – [[PolyGram]], [[EMI]], [[Warner Music Group]] (a unit of [[AOL Time Warner]]), [[Sony Music Entertainment]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] (a unit of [[Bertelsmann]]), and [[Universal Music Group]] (a unit of [[Vivendi]]) – were estimated to control between 80% to 90% of the global market.&lt;ref name=McChesney&gt;{{cite book|last1=McChesney|first1=Robert W.|title=Corporate Media and the Threat to Democracy|date=1997|publisher=Seven Stories Press|location=New York|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2013, the industry has consolidated even further. A series of mergers has reduced the big six to just three large corporations: Universal Music Group (now part of EMI's recorded music division), Sony Music Entertainment (EMI Publishing was absorbed into Sony/ATV Music Publishing), and Warner Music Group (which absorbed EMI's Parlophone and EMI/Virgin Classic labels).&lt;ref name="Mergers of Majors"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wueller|first1=Joshua R.|title=Mergers of Majors: Applying the Failing Firm Doctrine in the Recorded Music Industry|date=January 1, 2013|publisher=7 Brook. J. Corp. Fin. &amp; Com. L. 589 (2013)|ssrn=2293412|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these companies are part of larger conglomerates. Vertical concentration and horizontal integration allow cross pollination to promote products across multiple mediums. For instance, [[AOL Time Warner]] owns magazines, book publishing houses, film studios, television networks, cable channels, retail stores, libraries, sports teams etc., and can thus promote one through the utilization of another.

==Effects==

===Programming===
Scherzinger states that cross-ownership tends to reduce competition, lower risk, and [[Profit maximization|increase profits]]. He argues this "has forced musical production to succumb to the advertising, marketing, styling, and engineering techniques of increasingly uniform and narrow profit-driven criteria."&lt;ref name=Scherzinger /&gt; In the name of efficiency, new technology has allowed a station's technician to cut and paste news, weather and host chatter into pre-recorded programming.  Companies have greatly benefited from [[Top 40]], national news, and sports programming shows that can be purchased at the national level.&lt;ref name=Antitrust /&gt; News programming in particular is often produced and recorded at a remote location, as the practice streamlines the number of personalities needed on the air, and emulates a similar feel for the listener. This process of regionalized programming is referred to as [[voice tracking]].&lt;ref name=Scherzinger /&gt; Cost-sharing is now common practice. For radio broadcasters, the more homogeneity between different services held in common ownership (or the more elements within a program schedule which can be shared between 'different' stations), the greater the opportunity to gain profits.&lt;ref name=Antitrust /&gt;

This increase of cost-efficiency, an application of [[economies of scale]], also results in cutting staff and centralizing programming decisions on what should be broadcast.&lt;ref name=Hood&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hood|first1=Lee|title=Redefining "Local" in Radio News: The Impact of Consolidation on Coverage|journal=Conference Papers -- International Communication Association|date=2005|volume=Annual Meeting|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music-loving [[DJ]] playing whatever they feel fits the mood is largely fictional at any major station at this point in time. ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' reported that the mainstream press has accused several large radio conglomerates of playing less new music since the Telecommunications Act of 1996.&lt;ref name=Billboard /&gt; Consolidation has made it even less likely that one will hear something new, different, or unique.

===Musical diversity===
The number of [[radio format|formats]] provided by radio stations increased in all markets between 1996 and 2000.&lt;ref name=Scherzinger /&gt; However, an in-depth case study from the [[Future of Music Coalition]] shows that a quantitative focus on formats obscures their interconnections. Despite different names, formats extensively overlap and have similar playlists. For example, alternative, Top 40, rock, and hot adult contemporary are all likely to play songs by similar bands, even though their formats are not the same. The Future of Music Coalition reports an analysis of charts in Radio and Records and Billboard's Airplay Monitor revealed considerable playlist overlap – as much as 76% – between supposedly distinct formats.&lt;ref name=FMC /&gt; This overlap may enhance the homogenization of the airwaves.&lt;ref name=Scherzinger /&gt;

FMC's study concludes that allowing unlimited national consolidation has resulted in less competition, fewer viewpoints, and a decrease in diversity in radio programming – a trend in the opposite direction of Congress's stated goals for the FCC's media policy.&lt;ref name=FCC&gt;{{cite web|title=1996 Telecom Act|url=https://transition.fcc.gov/telecom.html|website=FCC|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report, titled ''False Premises, False Promises: A Quantitative History of Ownership Consolidation in the Radio Industry'', also says that radio consolidation has no added benefits for DJ's, programmers and musicians working in the music industry.&lt;ref name=FMC&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiCola|first1=Peter|title=False Premises, False Promises: Executive Summary|url=https://futureofmusic.org/false-premises-false-promises-executive-summary|website=Future of Music Coalition|publisher=FMC|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polgreen says that for listeners, the most readily apparent result of consolidation is the rise of cookie cutter [[playlist]]s. Teams of [[market research]]ers strategically compile playlists to be as widely appealing as possible rather than base the song choices on merit. For example, on an [[oldies]] show, probably the most heavily researched and systematized format in radio, classic hits will be played almost every day, while critically acclaimed songs by the same bands get little or no play. What one hears has been carefully crafted to appeal to [[Targeted marketing|targeted demographic groups]] for that station.&lt;ref name=Polgreen /&gt; Indeed, format competition and subsequent adaption of similar formats has become a major facet of modern radio.&lt;ref name=Wirth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wirth|first1=Todd|title=Direct Format Competition on the Radio Dial and the Telecommunications Act of 1996: A Five-Year Trend Study|journal=Journal of Radio Studies|date=2002|volume=9|issue=1|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As companies seek to extend their demographic reach, they tend to promote music with "general" appeal. While general appeal may seem relatively neutral at first glance, Scherzinger juxtaposes a best case scenario (tunes that are genuinely popular) with a worst-case scenario (bland content). Music under these conditions is subject to highly restrictive aesthetic codes and cultural judgments of those in positions of authority. He asserts that music with standardized ingredients is played on stations whose ownership is the most consolidated. Scherzinger continues, that "far from reflecting a neutral and general taste in music, this stabilized aesthetic tends to mediate the tastes of a highly particular demographic, namely, the social sector with [[disposable income]]: predominantly white, middle-class, heterosexual, 18-to-45-year-old males."&lt;ref name=Scherzinger /&gt;

When economic criteria drive programming decisions, it follows that radio play, media coverage, and sales will be directed toward the most lucrative [[demographics]].
Trade publication ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed, "A huge wave of consolidation has turned music stations into cash cows that focus on narrow playlists aimed at squeezing the most revenue from the richest demographics.... Truth be told, in this era of megamergers, there has never been a greater need for a little diversity on the dial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Christopher|title=Radio Receives Rivals by Satellite|journal=Variety|issue=5|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent survey of how much new music is added to Top 40 stations each week, Billboard/Airplay Monitor discovered that smaller groups and individually owned stations add and play more new songs each week. But there are also some prominent exceptions and a wide variance within certain groups. In general, the trend is towards more conservative, less aggressive releases of new material.&lt;ref name=Billboard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Billboard.|title=Does Radio Consolidation Equal Less New Music?|date=2002-09-14|volume=114|issue=37|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National advertising model===
Radio tends to get a majority of their revenue from advertising. Polgreen claims that from the 1996 Telecom Act, commercial radio broadcasters sought to form national media companies that could transition radio to a national advertising model. Media companies could then pitch their stations to both local and national advertisers. A company with multiple stations now allows marketing firms to approach the parent company, who can then provide them with the desired target audience through a specific station and [[time slot]].

Expanded to a national level, this advertising model generates many more leads for marketers at a fraction of the time and energy that going to individual stations previously required.&lt;ref name=Polgreen /&gt; A study on the impact of ownership rules following the 1996 Telecom Act found that the biggest area of change following the first few years of unrestrained consolidation was the negotiation of advertising rates.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Wenmouth|title=The Impact of Ownership Rules and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 on a Small Radio Market|journal=Journal of Radio Studies|date=1998|volume=5|issue=2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, revenue more than doubled in a decade, from $8.4 billion in 1990 to more than $17 billion by 2000.&lt;ref name=CPB&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting Revenue Fiscal Year 1999 Final Report|url=http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/revenue/99_revenue.pdf|publisher=Corporation for Public Broadcasting|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scherzinger argues that marketing branches of music companies no longer are purely administrative. Instead, he contends that "through intricate applications of [[management theory]] – supervising and measuring data – marketers settle priorities, make aesthetic judgments, and select musical forms." Marketers are increasingly who decide what music gets attention.

Radio has always had to balance listeners' desires with the need to deliver a predictable audience to advertisers. In the past, if listeners felt a song was too monotonous or repetitive, they could tune to a different station. Now, however, there is less choice available, and that song might be playing on a nearby station. The [[radio spectrum]] is a limited and publicly owned commodity. Since there is a definite amount of space on the radio spectrum, big companies have an incentive to dominate as much of it as they can.&lt;ref name=Antitrust&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leeper|first1=Sarah|title=The Game of Radiopoly: An Antitrust Perspective of Consolidation in the Radio Industry.|journal=Federal communications law journal [0163-7606]|date=2000|volume=52|issue=2|page=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declining local ownership===
Concentration of corporate ownership in the vast majority of local markets, at the expense of local ownership, has increased dramatically. The Local Ownership Index, created by Future of Music Coalition, shows that the localness of radio ownership has declined from an average of 97.1% to an average of 69.9%, a 28% percent drop.&lt;ref name=FMC /&gt; Polgreen asserts that the buying frenzy following the Telecom Act drove up station prices beyond the reach of the typical entrepreneur, making it difficult for smaller station owners to resist the financial pressures to sell. As a result, only dedicated local owners have survived.&lt;ref name=Polgreen /&gt;

==Alternatives==
Concentration of radio ownership translates to concentration of radio listenership. According to the FMC, the top four firms received 48% of the listeners in 2005. Yet across 155 markets, radio listenership has declined over the past fourteen years that data is available for, a 22% drop since its peak in 1989.&lt;ref name=FMC /&gt; It is plausible that the decline in radio listenership is due to consumers finding alternatives more attractive than homogenized radio.

===Satellite radio===
The two competing [[satellite radio]] services, Sirius and XM, merged to form [[Sirius XM Radio]] in 2009 and now has a government-regulated monopoly on the format.&lt;ref name=Satellite&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hart|first1=Kim|title=Satellite Radio Merger Approved|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/25/AR2008072503026.html|accessdate=2 May 2015|agency=The Washington Post|date=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger combined more than 18.5 million subscribers for both companies based on their existing subscribers on the date they merged.&lt;ref name=Sirius&gt;{{cite news|title=Sirius completes acquisition of XM Satellite|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/07/30/industry-satellite-dc-idUSN2926292520080730?sp=true|publisher=Reuters|date=Jul 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low-power FM stations===
One of these alternative formats, LPFMs ([[Low-power broadcasting|low-power FM stations]]) is a promising alternative to nationalized radio stations. By broadcasting at well under 100 watts (the minimum for commercial stations is set at 100 watts), these independently run stations have been viewed as a possible antidote to radio consolidation, as they are local stations dealing with local issues. The Federal Communications Commission seems to be sympathetic to single station owners, and its chairman, [[William Kennard]], has taken steps to encourage further diversity in ownership by proposing the creation of three new classes of licenses for LPFMs.&lt;ref name=Polgreen /&gt;

===Other media===
Other less homogenized formats can be found through individual libraries, as well as [[internet radio]] formats like [[podcasts]]. Other streaming services like [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] and [[Spotify]] are becoming increasingly popular.&lt;ref name=Streaming&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Ben|title=By the Numbers: The Streaming Music War (and Who's Winning)|url=http://time.com/3109273/streaming-music-services-compared/|website=Time|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a 2014 Nielsen report indicates that radio still remains the most popular platform for music consumption, as 59% of listeners use a combination of AM/FM or online radio streams to hear their favorite artists.&lt;ref name=Neilson&gt;{{cite web|title=Music 360|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/music-360-americans-make-music-their-top-entertainment-choice.html|publisher=The Nielson Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradigm shift==
Artists that experienced success in the industry prior to the [[1996 Telecommunications Act]], such as [[David Crosby]] of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] and [[Don Henley]] of [[The Eagles]], have brought to light what they believe are contributing to the nationwide homogenization of music. Crosby tells PBS in an interview, "When it all started, record companies – and there were many of them, and this was a good thing – were run by people who loved records, people like [[Ahmet Ertegun]], who ran [[Atlantic Records]], who were record collectors. They got in it because they loved music.... Now record companies are run by lawyers and accountants."&lt;ref name=Frontline /&gt; This view highlights a common theme that creativity and passion have been subverted by the financial incentives of corporatized media companies. Chief executives of large record labels often have no musical or cultural background. A head of Universal Vivendi, [[:fr:Jean-René Fourtou|Jean René Fourtou]], was previously in pharmaceuticals. [[Gunter Thielen]], the former head of Bertelsmann, previously managed the company's printing and industrial operations.&lt;ref name=Scherzinger /&gt;

Music journalist [[Ernesto Aguilar]] expressed the sentiment that "media consolidation means not only does corporate radio control who gets played, but also which artists get recognition, who is perceived as a voice in a music's history and who is erased from that history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aguilar|first1=Ernesto|title=Corporate radio's classic hip-hop oldies stations could destroy the genre's history|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/28/corporate-radios-classic-hip-hop-oldies-stations-could-destroy-the-genres-history|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reef Islands – Santa Cruz languages''' (usually shortened to '''Reefs – Santa Cruz''', abbreviated RSC) are a small language family comprising the languages of the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] and [[Reef Islands]]:

*[[Äiwoo language|Äiwoo]] (also known as ''Reefs'')
*languages of [[Nendo Island|Nendö island]] (Santa Cruz):
**[[Nanggu language|Nanggu]] (also known as ''Engdewu'')
**[[Natügu language|Natügu]]
**[[Nalögo language|Nalögo]]
**[[Noipä language|Noipä]] (Noipx)

==Background==
The debate in Oceanic linguistics dated from the Second International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics in 1978, where two opposing papers were presented. Peter Lincoln argued that the Reefs – Santa Cruz languages were Oceanic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
| first = Peter C.
| last = Lincoln
| title = Reefs – Santa Cruz as Austronesian
| booktitle = Second International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics: Proceedings
| publisher = Pacific Linguistics
| pages = 929–967
}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Stephen Wurm]] argued that they were [[Papuan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
| first = Stephen
| last = Wurm
| title = Reefs – Santa Cruz: Austronesian, but ... !
| booktitle = Second International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics: Proceedings
| publisher = Pacific Linguistics
| pages = 969–1010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
These languages were only definitively classified as part of the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] subgroup of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family after a series of papers that refuted the three major arguments for classifying them as either primarily [[Papuan languages]] or at least heavily influenced by a Papuan substrate. 
*[[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] and Åshild Næss (2007) demonstrated regular sound correspondences between RSC and Proto-Oceanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
| author= [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Ross, Malcolm]] and Åshild Næss

| year= 2007
| volume= 46
| pages= 456–498
| doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0003
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Åshild Næss (2006) showed that the "multiple noun classes" in RSC do not resemble Papuan-style [[grammatical gender|gender]] systems, but do have parallels in other Oceanic languages of nearby [[Vanuatu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
| author= Næss, Åshild 
| title= Bound Nominal Elements in Äiwoo (Reefs): A Reappraisal of the 'Multiple Noun Class Systems' 
| journal= Oceanic Linguistics
| year= 2006
| volume= 45
| pages= 269–296 
| doi= 10.1353/ol.2007.0006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Finally, Åshild Næss and Brenda H. Boerger (2008) showed that the complex verbal structures of RSC are derived by normal erosion of verb [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[grammaticalization]] of [[verb serialization]] commonly found in many Oceanic languages, and thus do not reflect a Papuan substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
| author= Næss, Åshild and Brenda H. Boerger

| year= 2008
| volume= 47
| pages= 185–212
| doi=10.1353/ol.0.0000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross and Næss (2007) offer a retrospective conclusion:

:How then did it come about that Stephen Wurm thought the RSC [Reefs – Santa Cruz] languages were Papuan? In small measure because the reconstruction of [[Proto-Oceanic language|POc]] had in the 1970s not progressed to where it is today. In larger measure because the typological features he found in the RSC languages had yet to be documented in other Oceanic languages. And because the RSC languages had undergone phonological changes which rendered some cognates unrecognisable and led eventually to the replacement of others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27613">The terms '''Rhinelandic''', '''Rhenish''', and '''Rhinelandic [[regiolect]]''' are used to name the colloquial language spoken in the so-called [[Rhineland]] of West [[Germany]]. This linguistic region is approximately formed of the West of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], the North of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and several smaller adjacent areas, including some areas in [[BeNeLux|neighbouring countries]].

Although there is such a thing as a Rhinelandic accent, and the regiolect uses it, the Rhinelandic regiolect is not simply [[German language|German]] spoken with an [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. Indeed, it deviates from [[Standard German]] with several thousand&lt;ref&gt;See "{{lang|de|Mitmachwörterbuch}}" at http://www.mitmachwoerterbuch.lvr.de/lesen.php and following pages for an (incomplete) word list.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly used additional [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, and [[idiom]]s, and some [[Grammar|grammatical constructions]]. Like other German regiolects, there is not a strict definition of what constitutues Rhinelandic; it can be spoken in a way very close to the standard language, but if locals talk to each other, it is mostly unintelligible to inhabitants of other German speaking regions.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Linguistics|Linguists]] classify the Rhinelandic Regiolect as a [[dialect]] of Standard German having a strong [[substratum]] of the many diverse local community languages of the Rhineland.&lt;ref name="Meine Oma spricht noch Platt" /&gt; As such, it has a middle position between the group of older West [[Central German language]]s, and [[Low Franconian language]]s spoken in the Rhineland, and the newer Standard German. The latter has only been brought into the area recently, under the [[Prussia]]n reign, when local speakers merged many common properties and words of their local languages into the standard language. Thus a new regiolect formed, which in many respects follows the conventions of Standard German, but at the same time continues local linguistic traditions, making it comprehensible in a much wider area than the original local languages. Nevertheless, it still reflects differences inside the [[dialect continuum]] of the Rhineland, since speakers often prefer distinct words, styles or linguistic forms depending on the subregion they come from.&lt;ref name="Kappes, Knies und Klüngel" /&gt;

== Scientific recognition and documentation ==
Differing across subregions of the Rhineland, and continually evolving, the Rhinelandic regiolect is not easily formalized. Though spoken by millions, it is rarely written down, which hampers scientific treatment. It has long been regarded as 'sheer [[Colloquial language|colloquial speech]]' by the scientific community, [[Linguicism|valued too low]] to be subject of serious recognition and research. Only recently&lt;ref&gt;beginning approximately in the 1970s&lt;/ref&gt; has it shifted into the focus of [[empirical research]] of some [[linguist]]s. Most notably, the linguistics department of the ''{{lang|de|[[Institut für Landeskunde und Regionalgeschichte]]}}'' (Institute for Regional Studies and History, former: ''{{lang|de|Amt für Rheinische Landeskunde}}'' (ARL) – Office of Rhinelandic Regional Knowledge and Documentation) of the ''{{lang|de|[[Landschaftsverband Rheinland]]}}'' (LVR) has contributed to that work.

Scientists of today's ''{{lang|de|Landschaftsverband}}'' have observed, documented, and researched lingual development in the [[Rhine Province]], and lately the [[Rhineland]], for about two hundred years.
During the past decades, they have published several studies of the current regiolect, as well as scientific books and papers, [[popular science]] books, articles and essays. Some of their findings are available in the [[world wide web]].&lt;ref&gt;An introduction can be found at {{cite web |url=http://www.rheinische-landeskunde.lvr.de/sprache/sprachen/regiolekt.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620182721/http://www.rheinische-landeskunde.lvr.de/sprache/sprachen/regiolekt.htm |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }} (last visited: June 1st, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; They regularly make surveys based on printed [[questionnaire]]s which more recently can also be obtained and submitted via [[e-mail]]. These surveys are supplemented, extended, and updated by use of their interactive website ''{{lang|de|[[Cooperative Dictionary of the Rhinelandic Colloquial Language|Mitmachwörterbuch der rheinischen Umgangssprache]]|}}''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arl.lvr.de/internet/app/olwb/mitmachwoerterbuch.php&lt;/ref&gt; (Cooperative Dictionary of the Rhinelandic Colloquial Language) since 2007.

Literature on collquialisms and colloquial German generally lists words and phrases coming from the Rhineland, marking their regional provenience appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;For instance: {{citation/core|Surname1=[[Heinz Küpper (linguist)|Heinz Küpper]]|Publisher=Klett Verlag|PublicationPlace=Stuttgart|Year=1987|ISBN=3-12-570600-9|Date=  1987|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite obviously not having heen created for this purpose and not including regiolect references at all, the well-known extensive multi-volume compendium ''{{lang|de|[[Rheinisches Wörterbuch]]}}''&lt;ref&gt;''{{lang|de|[[Rheinisches Wörterbuch]]}}.'' {{lang|de|Im Auftrag der [[Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften|Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften]], der Gesellschaft für Rheinische Geschichtskunde und des Provinzialverbandes der [[Rheinprovinz]] auf Grund der von Johannes Franck begonnenen, von allen Kreisen des Rheinischen Volkes unterstützten Sammlung bearbeitet und herausgegeben von Josef Müller, Heinrich Dittmaier, Rudolf Schützeichel und Mattias Zender}}. 9 volumes. Bonn/Berlin 1928-1971.&lt;br /&gt;Available online at http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/woerterbuecher/rhwb/wbgui?lemid={{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is nevertheless usually very helpful for finding hints to the probable meanings of words of the Rhinelandic regiolect that cannot be determined from other sources. Many regiolectal words&lt;ref&gt;According to an estimate of the linguistics department of the [[Institut für Landeskunde und Regionalgeschichte|Institute for Regional Studies and History]] of the [[Landschaftsverband Rheinland]], they have collected some 3000 to 6000 words of that kind.&lt;/ref&gt; come from, or are identical to, local language words which are documented in the ''{{lang|de|Rheinisches Wörterbuch}}''. They usually bear identical, related, or quite similar meanings.&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{citation/core|Surname1=[[Peter Honnen]]|Title={{lang|de|Kappes, Knies und Klüngel}} : {{lang|de|Regionalwörterbuch des Rheinlandes}}|Publisher=Greven Verlag|PublicationPlace=Köln|Year=2003|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 16|ISBN=3-7743-0337-1|Date=  2003|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammatical and syntactical deviations from Standard German ==

* Two of the important and most eye-catching characteristics of Rhinelandic are the [[progressive tense]] and the so-called "possessive [[dative]]", both of which do not exist in the standard language. Rhinelandic constructs progressive forms with the verb "to be", the preposition "''am''" (= "at the") and the infinitive, e.g. "''Ich bin am Warten''" (literally: ''I am at the wait'') is equivalent to English "I am waiting". The possessive-dative construction replaces the standard [[genitive]]. The possessor is named in the dative case, followed by a possessive pronoun, e.g. "''der alten Frau ihr Mann''" (literally: ''the old woman her husband''), which is equivalent to English "the old woman's husband". The following exemplary sentence features both a progressive verb construction and a possessive dative. Sentences like this are common in the Rhinelandic parlance, but often not easy to understand for German speakers unfamiliar with it.
:{| class="wikitable"
| Rhinelandic || Dä || Peter || is || - || dem || Manfred || '''sein''' || Farrad || '''am''' Repariern.
|-
| [[Standard German]] || [&lt;s color="lightgray"&gt;{{lang|de|Der}}&lt;/s&gt;] || {{lang|de|Peter}} || - || {{lang|de|repariert}} || [&lt;s color="lightgray"&gt;{{lang|de|des}}&lt;/s&gt;] || {{lang|de|Manfred'''s'''}} || - || {{lang|de|Fahrrad}} || -

|}

* There is different use of some [[preposition]]s and [[declension]]s or [[grammatical case]]s:
:{| class="wikitable"
| Rhinelandic || - ||colspan="2" align="center"| komma || '''bei''' || '''mich''' || &lt;ref name="bei" /&gt;
|-
| [[Standard German]] || {{lang|de|bitte}} || {{lang|de|komme}} || {{lang|de|einmal}} || {{lang|de|'''zu'''}} || {{lang|de|'''mir'''}} ||
|-
| [[English language|English]] || {{lang|en|please}} || {{lang|en|come}} || - || {{lang|en|to}} || {{lang|en|me}} ||
|}
* The regiolect sometimes uses a different auxiliary verb to build the [[past tense]]s. Most commonly, "''vergessen''" ("to forget") and "''anfangen''" ("to begin") take the auxiliary "''sein''" ("to be") instead of "''haben''" ("to have"). This is the case especially in the [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] area and makes sentences appear closer to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] than to [[German language|German]].
:{| class="wikitable"
| Rhinelandic || ich || '''bin''' || dat || ganz || vergessen
|-
| [[Dutch language|Dutch]] || {{lang|nl|ik}} || {{lang|nl|'''ben'''}} || {{lang|nl|dat}} || {{lang|nl|helemaal}} || {{lang|nl|vergeten}}

:{| class="wikitable"

|-
| [[English language|English]] || {{lang|en|I}} || {{lang|en|had}} || {{lang|en|it}} || {{lang|en|completely}} || {{lang|en|forgotten}} || -
|}
* Another phenomenon shared with Dutch is separation of "''da'' + preposition" (''dafür; damit'' = for that; with that). Standard German never splits this construction up, but in Rhinelandic and Dutch it is most common to do so. In this case, Rhinelandic "''da''" can be placed anywhere in the sentence, the preposition must follow at (or towards) the end of the sentence.
:{| class="wikitable"
| Rhinelandic || Ich || hab || da || - || kein(e) || Zeit || '''für''' || - 
|-
| [[Dutch language|Dutch]] || {{lang|nl|Ik}} || {{lang|nl|heb}} || {{lang|nl|daar}} || - || {{lang|nl|geen}} || {{lang|nl|tijd}} || {{lang|nl|'''voor'''}} || -

|}
* Individual expressions reflect dialectal usage, which also may lead to similarities with Dutch.
:{| class="wikitable"
| Rhinelandic || du || has || den || colspan="2" align="center"| {{lang|de|verschreck jemacht}} || -
|-
| [[Dutch language|Dutch]] || {{lang|nl|je}} || {{lang|nl|hebt}} || {{lang|nl|hem}} ||colspan="2" align="center"| {{lang|nl|laten schrikken}} || -

| [[English language|English]] || {{lang|en|you}} || {{lang|en|have}} || → ||colspan="2"| {{lang|en|scared}} or {{lang|en|spooked}} || →{{lang|en|him}} 
|}
* Names of persons, and denominators of roles and social positions are almost always preceded by [[grammatical article]]s. References to females, and especially to young females, may  [[Declension|decline]] with the neuter [[grammatical gender]] (which is not at all pejorative). Using articles with personal names is wrong in Standard German, but is normal not only in Rhinelandic but also in most dialects and colloquial varieties of German in central and southern Germany, as well as in Austria and Switzerland.

* People talk about themselves in the [[Illeism|third person]] in specific contexts, also with articles. This can be done in English, too, but not in correct Standard German. For example, a mother addressing her child:

== Intermediate position between Standard German and broad dialect ==

The following exemplary sentences may show how the regiolect is related to both Standard German and the actual dialect ([[Colognian language|Kölsch]] in this case), and found to be in the middle between the two.

{| class="wikitable"
|- bgcolor=#FFDEAD
|-
!Kölsch Dialect
| Jetz setze mer uns_eesch_ens hen un drinke_uns_e Käffje. || Dann sühd_et Levve att widder anders uß. || Ärbeide künne mer emmer noch!
|-
!Rhenish Regiolect
| Jetz setz'mer uns_ers'ma hin un trinken_uns_en Käffchen. || Dann siehd_et Leben schonn wider anders_aus. || Aabeiten köm_mer immer noch!
|-
!Standard German
| Jetzt setzen wir uns erst mal hin und trinken einen Kaffee. || Dann sieht das Leben schon wieder anders aus. || Arbeiten können wir noch immer!
|-
!English
| ''Now let's first sit down and have a cup of coffee.'' || ''After that, life will look much better.'' || ''Work can wait a while!''
|}

The example shows that the regiolect is based on Standard German. Thus, it uses ''ers'ma'' ("first") from the standard "erst mal" (vs. dialect: ''eesch ens''), and ''schonn'' ("already") from the standard "schon" (vs. dialect: ''att'' or ''allt''). With words common to both languages, vowel and consonant qualities are usually those of the standard (''trinken'' instead of ''drinke''; ''immer'' instead of ''emmer''), as are the rules of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].

However, the strong dialectal influence is also evident: Word final ''t/d'' is often deleted after another consonant (''jetz, un''); there is a tendency towards vowel shortening (''schonn, widder''); some structure words come in the dialectal form (''mer'' = "wir"; ''et'' = "es, das"); and words with an initial vowel are not separated from the preceding word by a [[glottal stop]], but rather linked to it, like in English. (This is marked in the example by an [[underscore]].)
The regiolect also uses [[diminutive]]s more often (''Käffchen'' instead of "Kaffee"), and has borrowed from the dialect many [[syntax|syntactical]] constructions unknown in the standard, e.g. ''mer trinken '''uns''' (en Käffchen)'', literally "we drink (a coffee) '''to ourselves'''", meaning: "to drink something with ease and pleasure."

Another good example is the word "afternoon", for which the regiolect uses a form similar to the dialect, but has adapted a vowel and a consonant to the standard.

The continuum ''Rhenish dialects'' – ''Rhenish regiolect'' – ''Standard German'' is comparable (however not wholly equal) to the continuum ''[[Scots language|Scots]]'' – ''(colloquial) [[Scottish English]]'' – ''British Standard English'' in Lowland Scotland. The first end of the continuum is made up by the traditional regional language, which is closely related to the standard, but has had its independent development for several centuries; in both cases, it is alive, but losing ground in everyday communication, especially among younger people. The other end of the continuum is the supra-regional standard language used for example on national television. In between the two, we find the new common speech, which is based on the standard, but has a strong [[substratum]] from the traditional language.

== Regional differences ==
The Rhinelandic regiolect has several regional and subregional features. Very many approximately coincide with the general dialect groups found in the local languages. For example:

:{| class="wikitable"
! English || German || Rhinelandic&lt;br /&gt;(North) || Rhinelandic&lt;br /&gt;(Center) || Rhinelandic&lt;br /&gt;(South)
|-
! little jar
|align="center"| Gefäß
|align="center"| Kümpken
|align="center"| Kümpche(n)
|align="center"| Kimpche
| &lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
As usual, the [[Low Franconian]] area in the North uses their own way to build the diminutive. The Central Rhineland between the [[Benrath line]] and the [[Sankt Goar line]] usually has an intermediate position. In this instance, the South uses their own vocalism that already incorporates parts of the [[Palatine German language|Palatinate German]] one, found even further South.

== Rhinelandic influences on Standard German ==
Like other jargons and regional varieties, also the Rhinelandic is influencing the [[Vocabulary]] of the German Standard. Instances of more recent additions are:

A grammatical deviation too, the [[Continuous and progressive aspects#German|''am''-Progressive]] mentioned above, has invaded the colloquial speech of other parts of the German-speaking areas. Experts state that it can be seen as "almost standard language use in wide parts."&lt;ref&gt;Duden, Volume 9, 6. edition 2007, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roland Stelter''' (born in [[Berlin]] in 1953) is a German author, visual artist and designer.

== Education ==
Stelter grew up in the [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]] area of Berlin. His mother was a seamstress and his father owned a small corner store. He attended the Diesterweg Gymnasium where he studied art and design under Horst Henschel. He then studied [[sociology]] under Professor [[Urs Jaeggi]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]], earning a master's degree. At the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] in Berlin in the 1980s, he studied life drawing under Professor Peter Müller. Stelter has also worked as a newspaper boy, a packer, a gardener, a house painter and as a labourer in the metal and construction industries. Since the 1970s he managed cultural exchange projects. He also worked as an academic tutor for Professor [[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]] at the Free University Berlin.

== Cultural and political activities ==
In the 1980s Stelter wrote for the arts sections of Berlin newspapers such as Berliner Extradienst, Die Neue and [[die Tageszeitung]]. He was CEO and editor-in-chief of the cultural journal omnibus published by the [[Akademie der Künste]] in Berlin, the Hochschule der Künste, the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], the Berliner [[Schaubühne]], the ''Freunde der Deutschen Kinemathek'' and other major [[West Berlin]] cultural institutions. In the 1990s Stelter worked as a designer, [[Content management|content manager]] and copywriter for advertising agencies. In the late 1990s he was head of public relations for Germany’s largest city planner at that time, the development agency Bornstedter Feld. Stelter co-founded the Galerie Augustus in the [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] area of Berlin in beginning of the 1990s. The gallery exhibited the works of artists such as Kerstin Grimm, [[Melanie Manchot]], [[Martin Parr]], [[Eva Rubinstein]], Ransome Stanley and [[Emilio Vedova]]. Stelter also participated in the launch and organisation of many other cultural and political projects while continuing to work as an author, journalist, painter, sculptor and photographer. In 1983 he co-founded the ‘Aktives Museum Faschismus und Widerstand in Berlin’, serving together with Heinz Schilling as deputy chairman of the board of executives under Gerhard Schoenberner. He was one of the founders of the major project ‘1933-1983’. The project was the first to bring together all of West Berlin’s democratically-oriented political groups for a critical re-evaluation of the Nazi period in Germany. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1993, he launched the major project ‘Upheaval – Chaos and Hope’ (‘Umbruch – Chaos und Hoffnung’) with the support of the [[Senate of Berlin]] and the [[Treuhand]], among others. His experiences with the "new Europe" were the inspiration of his international exhibition project ‘My Europe’ (‘Mein Europa’), ongoing since the year 2000.

=== Reception ===
June Carolyn Erlick wrote about the project Umbruch – Chaos und Hoffnung in the New York magazine ARTnews in October 1993:
:„(...), the innovative exhibition „Upheaval – Chaos and Hope" also underlined Berlin’s  provocative role as a stage for art, reminding visitors of the county’s Communist and  Nazi past. It set out to expose layers of Germany’s recent history with a three-building  show (…)."&lt;ref&gt;June Carolyn Erlick: Besprechung des ''Projekt Umbruch – Chaos und Hoffnung'' in her article ''Knocking Down the Invisible Wall'', in New York ARTnews Magazin, October 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulrich Roloff-Momin, Senator for Cultural Affairs Berlin, in the preface to the catalog "Umbruch – Chaos und Hoffnung" ("Upheaval – Chaos and Hope" [transl.]). Berlin 1993:
:"It is not enough to wait for better times. Anyone who wants more than just the  incorporation of East Berlin into West Berlin has to take action. With artworks and an  exhibition, the project ‘Umbruch – Chaos und Hoffnung’ (‘Upheaval – Chaos and  Hope’ [transl.]) provides the opportunity to reflect on a period of German history at a location which epitomizes Berlin (…)."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Roloff-Momin, Senator für kulturelle Angelegenheit des Landes Berlin, in »Grußwort« zum Buchkatalog »Umbruch – Chaos und Hoffnung«. Berlin 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen E. Till‚ The New Berlin. Memory, Politics, Place’. University of Minnesota Press. Minneapolis 2005:
:„At a public hearing sponsored by the Academy of Arts about the future of the Martin Gropius Bau in 1983, Roland Stelter recalled standing in front of the rubble of the former Gestapo building after the war as a child. Only later did he find out what had actually happened in that building. He stated that, one cannot so easily, when one speaks about a Museum of German History, move away [from the reality of] where this Gropius-Bau stands: namely, right next to the prison cells where witnesses were persecuted during this time, many of whom are still living."&lt;ref&gt;Karen E. Till. ''The New Berlin. Memory, Politics, Place''. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work as a visual artist ==
Roland Stelter has worked primarily as an author, painter, sculptor and photographer since the 1990s. His painting, drawing and sculpture are strongly influenced by post-war [[Abstract art|abstract modernism]]. Stelter met Emilia Vedova in the early 1990s. He and Vedova both participated in group exhibitions in the Galerie Augustus in Berlin and the Yavneh Art Workshop Gallery in Israel. Stelter’s photography strictly follows the principles of classical composition. He typically uses only natural light and avoids effects. Stelter’s work has been included in numerous exhibitions in Germany and around the world.  He collaborated with Lutz Dölle on the prize-winning, large-scale sculpture ‘Fragment des Regens’ (‘Fragment of Rain’). He collaborated with a biotechnology company in 1999 to create an exhibit on [[genetic engineering]] that included paintings, large-scale photographs and a [[Video art|video installation]]. His photography and text exhibition ‘Ms Zhuk and her granddaughter’ (‘Frau Zhuk und ihre Enkelin’) was shown in the ‘[[Topography of Terror]] – documentation center forced labor memorial’ in Berlin (‘Topographie des Terrors – Dokumentationszentrum NS-Zwangsarbeit’) from fall of 2010 until summer of 2011. The exhibition was about the life of Ms Zhuk, a Ukrainian survivor of Nazi [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] and [[concentration camp]]s who was persecuted by the [[KGB]] after her return. Large-scale sculptures by Stelter stand in the [[American Academy in Berlin|American Academy]] of Berlin's private park and in the city centre of [[Osnabrück]].

Following his wish, to show political responsibility as an artist, he carried out the photo exhibition «Memories of Europe« in the Chernigov Art Museum M. Galagan in Ukraine in 2014.

In 2015 the mayor of Potsdam, the minister of science, research and culture in Brandenburg, the Armenian ambassador to Germany, the representative of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation of Berlin-Brandenburg, and the publicist [[Rolf Hosfeld]] inaugurated Roland Stelter’s marble sculpture "[[Moral courage|Civil Courage]]." The sculpture memorializes Johannes Lepsius, and "symbolizes the commitment to civil action against genocide and war crimes." (Jan Jacobs, mayor of Potsdam). It was placed in the park of the Lepsius Villa in Potsdam, in the former military zone No. 7 where the [[KGB]] was based in the [[GDR]], now the home of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation of Berlin-Brandenburg. The location is also within a [[UNESCO]] world heritage site including a former KGB prison, the Neuer Garten park with the castle [[Cecilienhof]] where the [[Potsdam Conference]] was held in August 1945, the Belvedere of Sanssouci castle, and the Villa Henkel.

=== Reception ===
The artery magazine about Roland Stelter’s paintings and sculptures: [Gemälde und Steinskulpturen von Roland Stelter" ("Painting and stone sculptures by Roland Stelter" [transl.]), in artery June 1994]
:"His work gives the impression of being influenced by American Abstract Expressionism, a distinct classical aesthetic language in conjunction with a most subjective psychological expression. Nonetheless Stelter’s work captures a specific physical presence (…)."&lt;ref&gt;''Gemälde und Steinskulpturen von Roland Stelter'', in: artery im Juni 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Herbstreuth wrote in the Berlin newspaper Der Tagesspiegel [in: Der Tagesspiegel on 4 July 1994]:
:"Roland Stelter (...) works with marble blocks and blue stone, bringing both materials  into a fragile balance. Constructive forms are inspired by the concept that the stone  figures have to lose their weight and float in front of your eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Herbstreuth in: Der Tagesspiegel vom 4. Juli 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Bullman in the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung on the public sculpture ‘Fragment des Regens’ (‘Fragment of Rain’ [transl.])., May 8, 1999:
:"The inner link of antiquity and modernity, the confrontation of nature and high-tech as  well as the adjustment to the historical preconditions of the location are all captured by this sculpture."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bullman in ''Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung'' to Großskulptur ''Fragment des Regens'', 8 May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Simone Reber in the radio transmission "Galerie Rundgang" for Radio Kultur of SFB and ORB about the photo exhibition "Mythos Moscow" by Roland Stelter in the Gallery Blickensdorf Berlin, April 24, 2001:
:"The most beautiful are the photos of a hotel room with a wine-red velvet blanket on top of the bed and an art deco lamp, as if time has stopped. Roland Stelter makes prints  himself in which the colors turn out very soft, very cosy, very close to painting."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Reber: »Galerie Rundgang« in ''Radio Kultur'' of SFB and ORB to the photo exhibition »Mythos. Moskau« of Roland Stelter in the Galerie Blickensdorf Berlin,  24 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus Jörg Schönmetzler, Rosenheim's cultural attaché, said in a speech at the Galerie’s Christmas exhibition of the ‘Gallery of the Kunst und Kultur zu Hohenaschau e.V.’ in 2008:
:"In his case I am somewhat in favor of talking of a murderous aesthetics. For what he  creates are pictures which almost always tell of something else than what they show on the first look."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roland-stelter.de/cvplus_presse.html Roland Stelter: Press voices to the work]&lt;/ref&gt;

Julia Brodauf. ‘Frau Zhuk und ihre Enkelin’ (‘Ms. Zhuk and her granddaughter’ [transl.]), in: magazine ‘Junge Kunst’, Nr. 86, June 2011:
:"A series of quiet portraits was created (…) of women, landscapes and cities. Summery  pictures, flooded with light, almost casual in their expression, revealing past and  present pain only on a second or third view. (…) Roland Stelter has selected a visual  language which is documentary but not journalistic. (…) The work fits well into his  entire oeuvre of different art media (…), which was shaped and is shaped to a high  extent by abstract form. Psychological elements like strong facial expressions or gestures he leaves in the background; instead he relies on a stringently worked out  composition, and he relies on a lyrical interpretation of the half hidden."&lt;ref&gt;''Junge Kunst'' , Nr. 86, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdan Gulyay in the Ukrainian internet magazine „Gorod.cn.ua – Portal Tschernigova (Portal Çernigova)" at August 10, 2014 about the Open Air – Vernissage of he exhibition «Memories of Europe« by Roland Stelter of the Art Museum Chernigov M. Galagan, Ukraine: 
:''An exhibition of the well-known photographer from Germany here in our place, in Chernigov on the «Green Stage»! – I was thinking when I crossed the Red Square.

The mayor of Potsdam Jan Jacobs in his address at the inauguration of the sculpture "Civil Courage": ''The marble sculpture "Civil Courage" by Roland Stelter symbolizes the commitment to civil action against genocide and war crimes exemplified by Johannes Lepsius…. Carrara marble from the famous Italian region Massa-Carrara was used for this sculpture not, as so often, for figurative purposes. Instead the material was used here as a design element in itself. The material effectively symbolizes the concept of civil courage, which are acts of individual bravery necessary to safeguard our freedom…. Traditionally in sculpture, a marble monument also symbolizes the immortality of the visual arts. Here in particular the marble serves as a lasting reminder of the extraordinary civil commitment of a single individual for an entire people – a commitment that should never be forgotten. A universal theme here powerfully evoked by a critically astute artistic act.''&lt;ref&gt;The mayor of Potsdam Jan Jacobs in his address at the inauguration of the sculpture "Civil Courage" by Roland Stelter on 28.4.2015, press release of the city of Potsdam on 28.04.2015, published on the official city of Potsdam website in April/May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabel Fannrich-Lautenschläger: ''The white marble stone has a "broken character" – partially polished smooth, partially hatched and almost scaled using a hammer and hook…. In the middle of the war Lepsius travelled to Istanbul, and in 1916 defied his government by writing his "Report on the condition of the Armenian people in Turkey". The military censor reacted by suppressing the report. Lepsius quickly self-published 20,500 copies of the report. Because he of the ban on publication, he was forced to live in exile in Holland until the end of the war. "For a father of twelve, the situation was extremely risky for himself and his family," reminded Hosfeld. "I believe Roland Stelter's monument is extraordinary because it reflects the scars that life leaves on us all, no matter how virtuous we are.''&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Fannrich-Lautenschläger. "Mit Blessuren durchs Leben", in "Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten". 29.04.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephan Laude: ''At the inauguration, Stelter said that the inspiration for his work is always political. He purposely avoided a figurative approach…. The monument is a reminder. But it also points to the future said Rolf Hosfeld, Lepsius House's academic director…. Potsdam's mayor, Jann Jakobs (SPD), said that…the monument reaffirms the Lepsius House as a vital site for reflection, discussion and debate.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Laude "Ehrung eines Couragierten. Marmorstele erinnert an den Menschenrechtler Johannes Lepsius", in: Märkische Allgemeine Zeitung. 29. 04.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary work ==
Besides publishing cultural and political articles and essays, Stelter has also written short stories. In 2005 Rotbuch Verlag published his debut novel, ''Leons Bruder'', set during the turbulent times following the end of the [[Cold War]]. In recent years he has been working on a second novel about the consequences of the upheaval in the 1990s, particularly for the future. He has participated in the [[Berlin International Literature Festival]], such as when he gave a reading from his novel Leons Bruder or when he took part in the 24-hour global live online reading ''Authors for Peace'' on September 21, 2010, the United Nations ‘[[International Day of Peace]]’.

=== Reception ===
Tanja Hellwig writes in her article: ‚Sex und Politik im Kalten Krieg’ (‚Sex and Politics in the Cold War’ [transl.]) about the novel ’Leons Bruder’, in: Südkurier, June, 28th, 2005:
:"A breathless story that discusses the process of writing as it illuminates the connection between the private and the political. Stelter manages to successfully fuse these levels. (…). "&lt;ref&gt;Tanja Hellwig: ''Sex und Politik im Kalten Krieg'', [[Südkurier]] from 28 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanno Depner in the catalogue of the 5th International Literature Festival, Berlin 2005:
:"’Leons Bruder. Roman einer Zeitenwende (2005)’ tells the life story of a restless artist traveling between America, Germany, France, and Russia, and so sketches a complex historical panorama of the second half of the 20th Century."&lt;ref&gt;Hanno Depner: reception of ''Leons Bruder. Roman einer Zeitenwende''. In: Katalog des 5. Internationalen Literaturfestivals, Berlin 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work as a designer and lecturer ==
Besides working as an author, visual artist and designer, Stelter has also served periodically since 2010 as an [[adjunct professor]] of photography, design and professional writing at [[Webster University Vienna]] and in Amsterdam/Leiden. Together with his son Julian Stelter he ran the agency and international platform ‘forum bmp – communication design art in international partnership’ (2010 – 2016). In a nature reserve in the north-easter part of Germany he restored in cooperation with his son Benjamin Stelter an ensemble of listed buildings from 18th and 19th century and designed it for the purpose of modern living and working .

Stelter has lived for extended periods in the United States, France and Russia. He has two grown sons from his first marriage. He currently lives in Berlin.

'''Rwanda-Rundi''' (Ruanda-Rundi) is a group of [[Bantu language]]s, specifically a [[dialect continuum]], spoken in Central Africa. Neighboring dialects are [[mutually intelligible]], but more distant ones may not be. Two dialects, [[Kirundi]] and [[Kinyarwanda]], have been standardized as [[official languages]] of [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]] respectively. The other dialects are spoken in DR Congo (Kinyabwisha in North Kivu, Kinyamulenge in South Kivu), Uganda (Rufumbira spoken by the [[Bafumbira]] in Kisoro District), and Tanzania; [[Ha language|Ha]], with one million speakers, is the most widely spoken.

==Comparison of Kinyarwanda and Kirundi==
[[Kinyarwanda]] and [[Kirundi]] are very similar in many aspects, but differ in several ways as well.

===Tonal marking===
Both languages are [[tonal language]]s. High and low tones (or H and L) are the essential tones and, having a phonemic distinction on vowel length, when a long vowel changes from a low tone to a high tone it is marked as a rising tone and when a long vowel changes from a high tone to a low tone, it is marked as a falling tone. This is often illustrated in [[Kirundi]] in [[Meeussen's Rule]]. Propositions have also been made that tones can shift by a metrical or rhythmic structure. {{clear}}

===Word formation===
There are many instances in which the two speech varieties of both languages have words that are slightly different. However, these differences do not continually recur. One has to memorize such differences as "–anga" in Kinyarwanda in contrast to "-anka" in Kirundi (meaning to dislike or hate), because the shift from "g" to "k" is extremely rare, with proof being words like "inka" (cow), "inkono" (pot) and many other words where "nk" is common in both dialects. Such  minor variations involve different consonants, vowels or vowel lengths, tones or affixes.

The term "'''short-arm inspection'''" is a [[military]] [[euphemism]] referring to the routine medical inspection of male soldiers' [[penis]]es ("short arms") for signs of [[sexually-transmitted disease]]s and other medical problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/short%20arm%20inspection merriam-webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise origin of the term is uncertain; however, American&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Martin Marix|title=American Voices of World War I: Primary Source Documents, 1917-1920|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135969787|pages=11–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8K2AgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=short+arm+inspection+wwi&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australian]] troops are known to have used the term during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070522093343/http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/res/aus_words/wwi/S.php  Glossary of WWI slang: S], at the Australian National Dictionary Centre (via [[archive.org]]); version archived May 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The practice within the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during World War 2 was described by an anonymous American soldier, who had been forced to work as a truck driver while held as a prisoner of war, and who came into daily close contact with Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/1945-01IntelligenceBulletinVol03No05#page/n1/mode/2up | title=The Japanese G.I. | journal=Intelligence Bulletin |date=January 1945  | volume=III | issue=5 | pages=9 |publisher=Military Intelligence Service, War Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5781">In [[mathematics]], '''Sullivan conjecture''' can refer to any of several results and conjectures prompted by [[homotopy theory]] work of [[Dennis Sullivan]]. A basic theme and motivation concerns the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] set in [[group action]]s of a [[finite group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The most elementary formulation, however, is in terms of the [[classifying space]] &lt;math&gt;BG&lt;/math&gt; of such a group. Roughly speaking, it is difficult to map such a space &lt;math&gt;BG&lt;/math&gt; continuously into a finite [[CW complex]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in a non-trivial manner. Such a version of the Sullivan conjecture was first proved by [[Haynes Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2007071?uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21100787615331 Haynes Miller, The Sullivan Conjecture on Maps from Classifying Spaces, The Annals of Mathematics, second series, Vol. 120 No. 1, 1984, pp. 39-87]. JSTOR: The Annals of Mathematics. Accessed May 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in 1984, Miller proved that the [[function space]], carrying the [[compact-open topology]], of [[base point]]-preserving mappings from &lt;math&gt;BG&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[weakly contractible]].

This is equivalent to the statement that the map &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;F(BG, X)&lt;/math&gt; from X to the function space of maps &lt;math&gt;BG&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, not necessarily preserving the base point, given by sending a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the constant map whose image is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a [[weak equivalence (homotopy theory)|weak equivalence]]. The mapping space &lt;math&gt;F(BG, X)&lt;/math&gt; is an example of a homotopy fixed point set. Specifically, &lt;math&gt;F(BG, X)&lt;/math&gt; is the homotopy fixed point set of the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acting by the trivial action on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In general, for a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acting on a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the homotopy fixed points are the fixed points &lt;math&gt;F(EG, X)^G&lt;/math&gt; of the mapping space &lt;math&gt;F(EG, X)&lt;/math&gt; of maps from the [[Covering space|universal cover]] &lt;math&gt;EG&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;BG&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; under the &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-action on &lt;math&gt;F(EG, X)&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on a map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F(EG, X)&lt;/math&gt; by sending it to &lt;math&gt;gfg^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-equivariant map from &lt;math&gt;EG&lt;/math&gt; to a single point &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; induces a natural map η: &lt;math&gt;X^G = F(*,X)^G&lt;/math&gt;→&lt;math&gt;F(EG, X)^G&lt;/math&gt; from the fixed points to the homotopy fixed points of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acting on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Miller's theorem is that η is a weak equivalence for trivial &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-actions on finite-dimensional CW complexes. An important ingredient and motivation (see [1]) for his proof is a result of [[Gunnar Carlsson]] on the [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of &lt;math&gt;BZ/2&lt;/math&gt; as an unstable module over the [[Steenrod algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlsson|first=Gunnar|title=G.B. Segal's Burnside Ring Conjecture for (Z/2)^k|journal=Topology|year=1983|volume=22|issue=1|pages=83–103|doi=10.1016/0040-9383(83)90046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's theorem generalizes to a version of Sullivan's conjecture in which the action on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is allowed to be non-trivial. In,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Denis|title=Geometric topology. Part I.|year=1971|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan conjectured that η is a weak equivalence after a certain p-completion procedure due to A. Bousfield and [[Daniel Kan|D. Kan]] for the group &lt;math&gt;G=Z/2&lt;/math&gt;. This conjecture was incorrect as stated, but a correct version was given by Miller, and proven independently by Dwyer-Miller-Neisendorfer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dwyer|first=William|author2=Haynes Miller |author3=Joseph Neisendorfer |title=Fibrewise Completion and Unstable Adams Spectral Sequences|journal=Israel Journal of Mathematics|year=1989|volume=66|issue= 1-3|doi=10.1007/bf02765891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlsson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlsson|first=Gunnar|title=Equivariant stable homotopy and Sullivan's conjecture|journal=Invent.

Miller's proof involves an unstable [[Adams spectral sequence]], Carlsson's proof uses his affirmative solution of the [[Segal conjecture]] and also provides information about the homotopy fixed points &lt;math&gt;F(EG,X)^G&lt;/math&gt; before completion, and Lannes's proof involves his T-functor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Lionel|title=Unstable Modules over the Steenrod Algebra and Sullivan's Fixed Point Set Conjecture|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago and London|isbn=0-226-74203-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Svan language''' (Svan: {{lang|sva|ლუშნუ ნინ}} ''lušnu nin''; {{lang-ka|სვანური ენა}} ''svanuri ena'') is a Caucasian language spoken in the western [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] region of [[Svaneti]] primarily by the [[Svans|Svan people]].&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, David. Ethnic Groups Worldwide: A Ready Reference Handbook. Phoenix: Oryx Press, 1998. p 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen F. Jones]]. [http://www.everyculture.com/Russia-Eurasia-China/Svans-Orientation.html Svans]. ''World Culture Encyclopedia''. Retrieved on March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; With its speakers variously estimated to be between 30,000 and 80,000, the [[UNESCO]] designates Svan as a "definitely [[endangered language]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1058.html UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger]&lt;/ref&gt; It is of particular interest because it has retained many archaic features that have been lost in the other South-Caucasian languages.

==Features==

===Familial features===
Like all languages of the Caucasian language family, Svan has a large number of consonants. It has agreement between subject and object, and a [[split ergativity|split-ergative]] [[Morphosyntactic alignment|morphosyntactic system]]. Verbs are marked for [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[evidentiality]] and [[Kartvelian languages#Verb|"version"]].

===Distinguishing features===
Svan retains the [[voiceless uvular plosive|voiceless aspirated uvular plosive]], {{IPA|/qʰ/}}, and the glides /w/ and /j/. It has a larger vowel inventory than Georgian; the Upper Bal dialect of Svan has the most vowels of any South-Caucasian language, having both long and short versions of {{IPA|/a ɛ i ɔ u æ ø y/}} plus {{IPA|/ə eː/}}, a total of 18 vowels (Georgian, by contrast, has just five).

Its morphology is less regular than that of the other three sister languages, and there are notable differences in verbal inflections.

==Distribution==
Svan is the native language of fewer than 30,000 [[Svan people|Svans]] (15,000 of whom are Upper Svan dialect speakers and 12,000 are Lower Svan), living in the mountains of [[Svaneti]], i.e. in the districts of [[Mestia]] and [[Lentekhi]] of Georgia, along the [[Enguri River|Enguri]], [[Tskhenistsqali]] and [[Kodori River|Kodori]] rivers. Some Svan speakers live in the [[Kodori Valley]] of the de facto independent republic of [[Abkhazia]]. Although conditions there make it difficult to reliably establish their numbers, there are only an estimated 2,500 Svan individuals living there.&lt;ref name="DoBeS"&gt;[http://www.mpi.nl/DOBES/projects/svan DoBeS (&lt;u&gt;Do&lt;/u&gt;kumentation &lt;u&gt;Be&lt;/u&gt;drohter &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;prachen, Documentation of Endangered Languages)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is used in familiar and casual social communication. It has no written standard or official status. Most speakers also speak [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the country's official language, and use it as their literary and business language. There is no official instruction in Svan, and the number of speakers is declining due to the dispersal of the Svan population in the face of increasing economic hardship and due to the campaign of the Georgian government to "georgianize" the svanetian people. The Georgian government does not recognize the Svanetian language as an language due to fear of separatism, despite the great difference between the two languages. The language is regarded as being endangered, as proficiency in it among young people is limited.

==History==
Svan is the most differentiated member of the four South-Caucasian languages and is believed to have split off in the [[2nd millennium BC]] or earlier, about one thousand years before [[Georgian language|Georgian]] did.

==Dialects==
The Svan language is divided into the following dialects and subdialects:
*Upper Svan (about 15,000 speakers)
**Upper Bal: [[Ushguli]], Kala, Ipar, Mulakh, [[Mestia]], Lenzer, Latal.
**Lower Bal: Becho, Tskhumar, Etser, Par, Chubekh, Lakham.
*Lower Svan (about 12,000 speakers)
**Lashkhian: Lashkh.
**Lentekhian: [[Lentekhi]], Kheled, Khopur, Rtskhmelur, Cholur

# Freely varies between {{IPA|[ə]}} and {{IPA|[ɨ]}}

Apart from the odd {{IPA|/eː/}}, only Upper Bal and Lashkh dialects have long vowels.  Only Upper Bal has {{IPA|/æ, æː/}}; Lashkh does not have the front rounded vowels {{IPA|/œ, œː, y, yː/}}.

===Alphabet===
The alphabet, illustrated above, is similar to the [[Mingrelian alphabet]], with a few additional letters otherwise obsolete in the [[Georgian script]]:
* ჶ {{IPA|/f/}}
* ჴ {{IPA|/q⁽ʰ⁾/}}
* ჸ {{IPA|/ʔ/}}
* ჲ {{IPA|/j/}}
* ჳ {{IPA|/w/}}
* ჷ {{IPA|/ə/}}
* ჱ {{IPA|/eː/}}

These are supplemented by diacritics on the vowels (the [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] for front vowels and [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] for length), though those are not normally written.  The digraphs 
* ჳი ("wi") {{IPA|/y/}}
* ჳე ("we") {{IPA|/œ/}}
are used in the Lower Bal and Lentekh dialects, and occasionally in Upper Bal; these sounds do not occur in Lashkh dialect.

Syntactics, or syntax, is concerned with the way sentences are constructed from smaller parts, such as words and phrases. Two steps can be distinguished in the study of syntactics. The first step is to identify different types of units in the stream of speech and writing. In natural languages, such units include sentences, phrases, and words. The second step is to analyze how these units build up larger patterns, and in particular to find general rules that govern the construction of sentences.[http://people.dsv.su.se/~vadim/cmnew/chapter2/ch2_21.htm]

This can be broken down into constituents, which are a group of words that are organized as a unit, and the organization of those constituents. They are organized in a hierarchical structure, by embedding inside one another to form larger constituents.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Carnie, Andrew (2013) Syntax: A Generative Introduction. 3rd edition. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Universal Grammar: the Chomskyan view ===
In [[Chomsky]]’s view, humans are born with innate knowledge of certain principles that guide them in developing the grammar of their language. In other words, Chomsky’s theory is that language learning is facilitated by a predisposition that our brains have for certain structures of language.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as "[[universal grammar]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of universal grammar entails that humans are born with an innate knowledge (or structural rules) of certain principles that guide them in developing the grammar of their language.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

For example:
* The sentence "Robert book reads the" is immediately perceived as ungrammatical in English , even though it may appear comprehensible. Conversely, we recognize that a sentence such as “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.” is grammatically correct English, even though it is nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntactic structures|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|publisher=|year=1978|isbn=9789027933850|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ferdinand de Saussure  ===
Regarded as the "Founder of Structural Linguistics", which reflects the concept of structuralism, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|de Saussure]] stated the ways in which human culture requires an overarching structure to relate to in order to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191929574|title=The Oxford dictionary of philosophy|last=1944-|first=Blackburn, Simon,|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199541430|edition=2nd ed., rev|location=Oxford|oclc=191929574}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines language to be different than human speech, which is fundamental and essential to language. While speech is a combination of several disciplines (i.e. physical, psychological, etc.) and is part of an individual and their society, language is a system of classification of its own entity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Course in General Linguistics|last=de Saussure|first=Ferdinand|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=1915|isbn=|editor-last=Bally|editor-first=Charles|location=|pages=15,123|translator-last=Baskin|translator-first=Wade|editor-last2=Sechehaye|editor-first2=Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Saussure argues that in written language, words are chained together in sequence on the chain of speaking, and therefore gain relations based on the linear nature of language.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Language, however, is not simply a classification for universal concepts, as translating from one language to another proves to be a difficult task.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ferdinand de Saussure|last=Culler|first=Johnathon|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Languages organizes their own world differently, and do not name existing categories, rather articulate their own.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This idea explains that though languages can differ within levels of Syntactic Hierarchy, all languages encompass the same set of levels.

== The Levels of Syntactic Hierarchy ==
[[File:The_Levels_of_Syntactic_Hierarchy_.jpg|thumb|This diagram represents the order in which the levels of Syntactic Hierarchy appear.]]

=== Groups of sentences (text) ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Separate sentences can combine together to create one sentence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, the sentence “The boy chased the ball” and “He didn’t catch it” can be combined together. You can do this in many ways including stringing one sentence after the other or joining the sentences with conjunctions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. “The boy chased the ball, he didn’t catch it.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote href="File:The Levels of Syntactic Hierarchy .jpg"&gt;2. “The boy chased the ball, but he didn’t catch it.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote resource="File:The Levels of Syntactic Hierarchy .jpg" height width&gt;3. “The boy chased the ball, and he didn’t catch it.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== [[Sentence (linguistics)|Sentence]] ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Phrases combined to form sentences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The phrase “the girl” combines with the phrase “ran away” to form the sentence: “The girl ran away.”  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== [[Phrase]]s ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Words combine to form phrases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The word “the” combines with “girl” to form the phrase: “The girl” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== [[Word]]s ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Morphemes combine to form words.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Morphemes belong to categories that determine how they combine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, the word 'manageable' is made up of two morphemes 'manage' which is a verb and 'able' which is an adjective, these categories tell the morphemes how to combine so they form the word 'manageable.' &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Syntactic Analysis and Theory|last=Sportiche|first=Dominique|last2=Koopman|first2=Hilda|last3=Stabler|first3=Edward|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4051-0016-8|location=Singapore|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== [[Morpheme]]s ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Smallest meaningful unit in a word.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, “boys” has two morphemes “boy” and “-s.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== [[Phoneme]]s ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;A unit of sound such as individual consonants and vowels of a language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, /p/, /t/ and /æ/ are phonemes in English. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Phonetic form ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;A subset of sounds which demonstrates the different variations of a phoneme.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Diacritics can be used to represent this, for example aspiration can be added to the letter /p/ in the word /pʰɪt/. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Unsegmented Speech ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Refers to ambiguous streams of words with spaces in between. For example, this can represent how an infant may hear human speech.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==  Analysis of Syntactic Hierarchy Levels  ==

=== Sentence   ===
[[File:Sentence illustration .jpg|thumb|This illustration demonstrates how phrases combine to form a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Study of Language|last=Yule|first=George|publisher=Cambridge|year=2015|isbn=9781107658172|location=United Kingdom: Cambridge University|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Sentences are the hierarchal structure of combined phrases. When constructing a sentence, two types of phrases are always necessary: Noun Phrase (NP) and Verb Phrase (VP), forming the simplest possible sentence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Study of Language|last=Yule|first=George|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781107658172|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; What determines whether a sentence is grammatically constructed (i.e. the sentence makes sense to a native speaker of the language), is its adherence to the language's [[phrase structure rules]], allowing a language to generate large numbers of sentences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Languages cross-linguistically differ in their phrase structure rules, resulting in the difference of order of the NP and VP, and other phrases included in a sentence. Languages which do have the similar phrase structure rules, however, will translate so that a sentence from one language will be grammatical when translated into the target language.

French example: 
* Sentence: "Le chien a aimé la fille" (translation: "The dog loved the girl") 
The French sentence directly translates to English, demonstrating that the phrase structures of both languages are very similar.

=== Phrase ===
The idea that words combine to form phrases. For example, the word “the” combines with word “dog” to form the phrase “the dog”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistics for dummies|last=Burton|first=Strang|last2=Dechaine|first2=Rose-Marie|last3=Vatikiotis-Bateson|first3=Eric|publisher=Juha Wiley &amp; Sona Canada, Ltd.|year=2012|isbn=|location=Ontario|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A is a sequence of words or a group of words arranged in a grammatical way to combine and form a sentence. There are five commonly occurring types of phrases; Noun phrases (NP), Adjective phrases (AdjP), Verb phrases (VP), Adverb Phrases (AdvP), and Prepositional Phrases (PP).The idea that words combine to form phrases. For example, the word “the” combines with word “dog” to form the phrase “the dog” . Furthermore, hierarchical combinations of words in their formation of phrasal categories are apparent in French as well.

French examples:  
* Noun phrase: "Le chien" (translation: "The dog") 
* Verb phrase: " a aimé la fille" (translation: "loved the girl")

==== Noun phrase ====

A [[noun phrase]] refers to a phrase that is built upon a noun. For example, “ The dog”  or “the girl” in the sentence “the dog loved the girl” act as noun phrases.

==== Verb phrase ====

[[Verb phrase]] refers to a phrase that is composed of at least one main verb and one or more helping/auxiliary verb (every sentence needs at least one main verb). For example, the word “loved the girl” in the sentence “the dog loved the girl” acts as a verb phrase.

''see also'' [[Adjective phrase]]s (AdjP), [[Adverb phrase]]s (AdvP), and [[Prepositional phrases]] (PP)

===== Phrase structure rules =====
A [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structure]] tree shows that a sentence is both linear string of words and a hierarchical structure with phrases nested in phrases (combination of phrase structures) A phrase structure tree is a formal device for representing speaker’s knowledge about phrase structure in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern phrase structure grammar|last=Borsley|first=Robert. D|publisher=Blackwell|year=1996|isbn=0631184066|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syntactic category of each individual word appears immediately above that word. In this way, “the” is shown to be a determiner, “child” is a noun, and so on.

=== Word  ===
The subdomain that deals with words is [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology,]] which states that words are made up of morphemes which combine in a regular and rule-governed fashion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For example, the word 'national' is made up of two morphemes 'nation' which is a noun and '-al' which is a suffix that means pertaining to, this meaning helps us in categorizing '-al' as an adjective. These categories aid in arranging the morphemes so they can combine in a way that will form the word 'national,’ which is an adjective.

Morphology states that words come in categories, and the morphemes that join together to create the word assign the category.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The two main categories are open class, where new words can be created and closed class where there is a limited number of members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Within both of these categories there are further sub-categories. Open class includes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, and closed class includes: prepositions, determiners, numerals, complementizers, auxiliaries, modals, coordinators, and negation/affirmation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These sub categories can be further broken down for example, verbs can be either transitive or intransitive. These categories can be identified with semantic criteria about what a word means, for instance nouns are said to be people, places, or things while verbs are actions. Words are all placed in these categories and depending on their category they follow specific rules that determine their word order.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Cross-Linguistically other languages form words similarly to English. This is done by having morphemes of different categories combine in a rule governed fashion in order to create the word.

French example:
* "é"- masculine past participle root verb suffix of regular ''-er'' verbs
* "aimer" (translation: to like/love)-&gt; "aim" + "é" = "aimé" (translation: liked)

== Artificial language ==

In artificial languages, lexemes, tokens, and formulas are usually found among the basic units.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tagalog''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|l|ɒ|ɡ}};&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[OED]]'' and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TAGALOG Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-tl|tɐˈɡaːloɡ|lang-tl}}) is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] spoken as a first language by a quarter of the population of the [[Philippines]] and as a second language by the majority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://opinion.inquirer.net/97210/numbers-on-filipino-cebuano-and-english]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aboutworldlanguages.com/tagalog]&lt;/ref&gt; Its standardized form, [[official language|officially]] named ''[[Filipino language|Filipino]]'', is the [[national language]] of the Philippines, and is one of two official languages alongside [[Philippine English|English]].

It is related to other [[Philippine languages]], such as the [[Bikol languages]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], the [[Visayan languages]], [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], and [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]], and more distantly to other Austronesian languages, such as the [[Formosan languages]] of [[Taiwan]], [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Māori language|Māori]], and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]. Tagalog is the predominant language used in the ''[[tanaga]]'', a type of Filipino poem and the indigenous poetic art of the Tagalog people.

==History==
{{Main|Old Tagalog}}

[[File:Baybayin alpha.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The Tagalog [[Baybayin]] script]]

The word ''Tagalog'' is derived from the [[endonym]] ''taga-log'' ("river dweller"), composed of ''tagá-'' ("native of" or "from") and ''ilog'' ("river"). Linguists such as Dr. David Zorc and Dr. [[Robert Blust]] speculate that the Tagalogs and other Central Philippine ethno-linguistic groups originated in Northeastern [[Mindanao]] or the Eastern [[Visayas]].&lt;ref&gt;Zorc, David. 1977. "The Bisayan Dialects of the Philippines: Subgrouping and Reconstruction". ''Pacific Linguistics'' C.44. Canberra: The Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blust, Robert. 1991. "The Greater Central Philippines hypothesis". ''Oceanic Linguistics'' 30:73–129&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written record of Tagalog is the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]], which dates to 900 CE and exhibits fragments of the language along with [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Old Malay]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]]. The first known complete book to be written in Tagalog is the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' (Christian Doctrine), printed in 1593. The ''Doctrina'' was written in Spanish and two transcriptions of Tagalog; one in the ancient, then-current [[Baybayin]] script and the other in an early Spanish attempt at a [[Latin script|Latin]] orthography for the language.

Throughout the 333 years of Spanish rule, various grammars and dictionaries were written by Spanish clergymen. In 1610, the Dominican priest Francisco Blancas de San Jose published the “Arte y reglas de la Lengua Tagala” (which was subsequently revised with two editions in 1752 and 1832) in Bataan. In 1613, the Franciscan priest Pedro de San Buenaventura published the first Tagalog dictionary, his "Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala” in Pila, Laguna.

The first substantial dictionary of the Tagalog language was written by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Pablo Clain]] in the beginning of the 18th century. Clain spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books. He prepared the dictionary, which he later passed over to Francisco Jansens and José Hernandez.&lt;ref&gt;Juan José de Noceda, Pedro de Sanlucar, Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala, Manila 2013, pg iv, Komision sa Wikang Filipino&lt;/ref&gt; Further  compilation of his substantial work was prepared by P. Juan de Noceda and P.

The indigenous poet [[Francisco Baltazar]] (1788–1862) is regarded as the foremost Tagalog writer, his most notable work being the early 19th-century [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Florante at Laura]]''.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kun sino ang kumathâ ng̃ "Florante": kasaysayan ng̃ búhay ni Francisco Baltazar at pag-uulat nang kanyang karunung̃a't kadakilaan|author=Cruz, H.|date=1906|publisher=Libr.

===Historical changes===
[[File:Diariong Tagalog.jpg|thumb|right|''[[:tl:Diariong Tagalog|Diariong Tagalog]]'' (Tagalog Newspaper), the first bilingual newspaper in the Philippines founded in 1882 written in both Tagalog and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].]]
Tagalog differs from its [[Central Philippine languages|Central Philippine]] counterparts with its treatment of the [[Proto-Philippine language|Proto-Philippine]] [[schwa]] vowel {{IPA|*ə}}. In most [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] and [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] languages, this sound merged with {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|[o]}}. In Tagalog, it has merged with {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*dəkət}} (adhere, stick) is Tagalog ''dikít'' and Visayan &amp; Bikol ''dukot''.

Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*r}}, {{IPA|*j}}, and {{IPA|*z}} merged with {{IPA|/d/}} but is {{IPA|/l/}} between vowels. Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*ŋajan}} (name) and {{IPA|*hajək}} (kiss) became Tagalog ''ngalan'' and ''halík''.

Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*R}} merged with {{IPA|/ɡ/}}. {{IPA|*tubiR}} (water) and {{IPA|*zuRuʔ}} (blood) became Tagalog ''tubig'' and ''dugô''.

===Official status===
{{Main|Filipino language}}

Tagalog was declared the official language by the first revolutionary constitution in the Philippines, the [[wikisource:Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1897)#ARTICLE VIII: OFFICIAL LANGUAGE|Constitution of Biak-na-Bato]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=L00000000001&amp;page=1&amp;epage=1 |title=1897 Constitution of Biak-na-Bato, Article VIII |accessdate=2008-01-16 |publisher=Filipiniana.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228152829/http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=L00000000001&amp;page=1&amp;epage=1 |archivedate=2009-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the Philippine constitution designated English and Spanish as official languages, but mandated the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/1935constitutionofthephilippines.htm |title=1935 Philippine Constitution, Article XIV, Section 3 |accessdate = 2007-12-20 |publisher = Chanrobles Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; After study and deliberation, the National Language Institute, a committee composed of seven members who represented various regions in the Philippines, chose Tagalog as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines.&lt;ref name=MLQspeech&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.quezon.ph/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/mlq-speech-national-language-1.pdf |title=Quezon’s speech proclaiming Tagalog the basis of the National Language |author=Manuel L.

Quezon then, on December 30, 1937, proclaimed the selection of the Tagalog language to be used as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines.&lt;ref name=MLQspeech /&gt; In 1939, President Quezon renamed the proposed Tagalog-based national language as ''Wikang Pambansâ'' (national language).&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt; Under the Japanese puppet government during [[World War II]], Tagalog as a national language was strongly promoted; the 1943 Constitution specifying: The government shall take steps toward the development and propagation of Tagalog as the national language.".

In 1959, the language was further renamed as "Pilipino".&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt; Along with English, the national language has had official status under the 1973 constitution (as "Pilipino")&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/1973constitutionofthephilippines.htm |title=1973 Philippine Constitution, Article XV, Sections 2–3 |accessdate = 2007-12-20 |publisher = Chanrobles Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the present 1987 constitution (as Filipino).

===Controversy===
The adoption of Tagalog in 1937 as basis for a national language is not without its own controversies. Instead of specifying Tagalog, the national language was designated as ''Wikang Pambansâ'' ("National Language") in 1939.&lt;ref name=MLQspeech /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan |title=Mga Probisyong Pangwika sa Saligang-Batas |publisher=Wika.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later, in 1959, it was renamed by then Secretary of Education, José Romero, as ''[[Filipino language|Pilipino]]'' to give it a [[nation]]al rather than [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] label and connotation. The changing of the name did not, however, result in acceptance among non-[[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]], especially [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]]s who had not accepted the selection.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"/&gt;

The national language issue was revived once more during the [[Philippine Constitutional Convention election, 1970|1971 Constitutional Convention]]. Majority of the delegates were even in favor of scrapping the idea of a "national language" altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What the PH constitutions say about the national language|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/65477-national-language-philippine-constitutions|website=Rappler|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise solution was worked out—a "universalist" approach to the national language, to be called ''Filipino'' rather than ''Pilipino''. The 1973 constitution makes no mention of Tagalog. When a new constitution was drawn up in 1987, it named Filipino as the national language.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"/&gt; The constitution specified that as the Filipino language evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages. However, more than two decades after the institution of the "universalist" approach, there seems to be little if any difference between Tagalog and Filipino.

Many of the older generation in the Philippines feel that the replacement of English by Tagalog in the popular visual media has had dire economic effects regarding the competitiveness of the Philippines in trade and overseas remittances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The cost of being tongue-tied in the colonisers’ tongue |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2009/06/04/e-for-english |website=The Economist |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited |accessdate=10 July 2018 |date=4 June 2009 |quote=ONCE it claimed to have more English speakers than all but two other countries, and it has exported millions of them. But these days Filipinos are less boastful. Three decades of decline in the share of Filipinos who speak the language, and the deteriorating proficiency of those who can manage some English, have eroded one of the country's advantages in the global economy. Call-centres complain that they reject nine-tenths of otherwise qualified job applicants, mostly college graduates, because of their poor command of English. This is lowering the chances that the outsourcing industry will succeed in its effort to employ close to 1m people, account for 8.5% of GDP and have 10% of the world market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in education===
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}
Upon the issuance of Executive Order No. 134, Tagalog was declared as basis of the National Language. On 12th of April 1940, Executive No. 263 was issued ordering the teaching of the national language in all public and private schools in the country. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ncca.gov.ph/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-disseminationscd/language-and-translation/filipino-language-in-the-curriculum/|title=Filipino Language in the Curriculum - National Commission for Culture and the Arts|work=National Commission for Culture and the Arts|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Article XIV, Section 7 of the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] specifies, in part:

{{quote|Subject to provisions of law and as the Congress may deem appropriate, the Government shall take steps to initiate and sustain the use of Filipino as a medium of official communication and as language of instruction in the educational system.|&lt;ref name=1987constitutionXIV&gt;

{{quote|The regional languages are the auxiliary official languages in the regions and shall serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein.|&lt;ref name=1987constitutionXIV /&gt;}}

In 2009, the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] promulgated an order institutionalizing a system of mother-tongue based multilingual education ("MLE"), wherein instruction is conducted primarily in a student's mother tongue (one of the various regional Philippine languages) until at least grade three, with additional languages such as Filipino and English being introduced as separate subjects no earlier than grade two. In secondary school, Filipino and English become the primary languages of instruction, with the learner's first language taking on an auxiliary role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf Order No. 74 (2009)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616225924/http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }}. Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; After pilot tests in selected schools, the MLE program was implemented nationwide from School Year (SY) 2012-2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deped.gov.ph/orders/do-16-s-2012 DO 16, s. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dumlao|first1=Artemio|title=K+12 to use 12 mother tongues|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/807083/k12-use-12-mother-tongues|work=philstar.com|date=21 May 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Tagalog is a [[Central Philippine languages|Central Philippine]] language within the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. Being [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]], it is related to other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Tetum language|Tetum]] (of Timor), and [[Yami language|Yami]] (of Taiwan).&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;Lewis, M.P., Simons, G.F., &amp; Fennig, C.D. (2014). Tagalog. ''Ethnologue: Languages of the
World.'' Retrieved from http://www.ethnologue.com/language/tgl&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the languages spoken in the [[Bicol Region]] and the [[Visayas]] islands, such as the [[Bikol languages|Bikol group]] and the [[Visayan languages|Visayan group]], including [[Waray-Waray]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt;

===Dialects===
[[File:CalauanChurchjf4373 11.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[Ten Commandments]] in Tagalog.]]
At present, no comprehensive [[dialectology]] has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. [[Ethnologue]] lists Manila, Lubang, [[Marinduque]], Bataan (Western Central Luzon), [[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]], Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas (Quezon) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the [[Bulacan]] dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.

Some example of dialectal differences are:
* Many Tagalog dialects, particularly those in the south, preserve the glottal stop found after consonants and before vowels. This has been lost in Standard Tagalog. For example, standard Tagalog ''ngayón'' (now, today), ''sinigáng'' (broth stew), ''gabí'' (night), ''matamís'' (sweet), are pronounced and written ''ngay-on'', ''sinig-ang'', ''gab-i'', and ''matam-is'' in other dialects.
* In [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresian]]-[[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] Tagalog, {{IPA|[ɾ]}} is usually preferred over {{IPA|[d]}}. For example, ''bundók'', ''dagat'', ''dingdíng'', and ''isdâ'' become ''bunrók'', ''ragat'', ''ringríng'', and ''isrâ'', e.g. "sandók sa dingdíng" becoming "sanrók sa ringríng".
* In many [[Batangas Tagalog|southern dialects]], the progressive aspect infix of ''-um-'' verbs is ''na-''. For example, standard Tagalog ''kumakain'' (eating) is ''nákáin'' in Quezon and Batangas Tagalog. This is the butt of some jokes by other Tagalog speakers, for should a Southern Tagalog ask ''nákáin ka ba ng patíng?'' ("Do you eat shark?"), he would be understood as saying "Has a shark eaten you?" by speakers of the Manila Dialect.
* Some dialects have interjections which are considered a regional trademark. For example, the interjection ''ala e!'' usually identifies someone from Batangas as does ''hane?!'' in Rizal and Quezon provinces.
* [[Bulacan]] has a distinct and deep Tagalog words.

Perhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.15144/PL-B69|title = The dialects of Marinduque Tagalog|journal = B-69| last1=Soberano| first1=Ros| url=http://sealang.net/archives/pl/pdf/PL-B69.pdf| year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.

One example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, as of 2014 there were 100 million people living in the Philippines, where almost all of whom will have some basic level of understanding of the language. The Tagalog homeland, [[Katagalugan]], covers roughly much of the central to southern parts of the island of [[Luzon]]—particularly in [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], [[Bataan]], [[Batangas]], [[Bulacan]], [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Quezon]], [[Rizal]] and [[Zambales]]. Tagalog is also spoken natively by inhabitants living on the islands of [[Marinduque]] and [[Mindoro]], as well as [[Palawan]] to a lesser extent. It is spoken by approximately 64 million Filipinos, 96% of the household population;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Tagalog speakers are found in other parts of the Philippines as well as throughout the world, though its use is usually limited to communication between [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Filipino ethnic groups]]. {{As of|2010|alt=In}} 2010, the US Census bureau reported (based on data collected in 2007) that in the United States it was the fourth most-spoken language at home with almost 1.5 million speakers, behind [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Spanish-based creole languages|Spanish Creole]], [[French language|French]] (including Patois, Cajun, Creole), and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Tagalog ranked as the third most spoken language in metropolitan statistical areas, behind Spanish and Chinese but ahead of French.&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Language Use in the United States: 2007|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/acs-12.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=United States|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accents===
The Tagalog language also boasts [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accentations]] unique to some parts of [[Tagalog people|Tagalog-speaking regions]]. For example, in some parts of [[Manila]], a strong pronunciation of ''i'' exists and vowel-switching of ''o'' and ''u'' exists so words like "gising" (to wake) is pronounced as "giseng" with a strong 'e' and the word "tagu-taguan" (hide-and-go-seek) is pronounced as "tago-tagoan" with a mild 'o'.

[[Batangas Tagalog]] boasts the most distinctive accent in Tagalog compared to the more Hispanized northern accents of the language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.wiki2audio.com/wiki/Tagalog_language+Vowels|title=Tagalog Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212170114/http://en.wiki2audio.com/wiki/Tagalog_language+Vowels|archive-date=2017-02-12|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Batangas]] accent has been featured in film and television and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] actor [[Leo Martinez]] speaks with this accent. Martinez's accent, however, will quickly be recognized by native Batangueños as representative of the accent in western Batangas which is milder compared to that used in the eastern part of the province.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Bulacan Tagalog has more deep words and accented like Filipino during the Spanish period.

Quezon and Aurora's Tagalog has unique accents.

Cavite's were a mix of deep Tagalog and Chavacano, a language also spoken in Zamboanga.

Laguna also has a different set of accents.

Nueva Ecija's accent is like Bulacan's, but with different intonations. Tarlac also has this accent.

===Code-switching===
{{main article|Taglish}}
''Taglish'' and ''Englog'' are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.

Code-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are "Filipinized" by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.

:"Magshoshopping kami sa mall. Sino ba ang magdadrive sa shopping center?"
:"We will go shopping at the mall. Who will drive to the shopping center?"

City-dwellers are more likely to do this.

The practice is common in television, radio, and print media as well. Advertisements from companies like [[Wells Fargo]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[New Albertsons|Albertsons]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Western Union]] have contained Taglish.

==Phonology==
{{Main|Tagalog phonology}}
{{IPA notice}}
Tagalog has 33 [[phoneme]]s: 19 of them are [[consonant]]s and 14 are [[vowel]]s. Syllable structure is relatively simple, being maximally ''consonant-ar-vowel-consonant'', where ''consonant-ar'' only occurs in borrowed words such as ''trak'' "truck" or ''sombréro'' "hat".&lt;ref name=ELL&gt;{{ELL2|Tagalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
Tagalog has ten simple vowels, five long and five short, and four diphthongs.&lt;ref name=ELL/&gt; Before appearing in the area north of Pasig river, Tagalog had three vowel qualities: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. This was later expanded to five with the introduction of words from Northern Philippine languages like [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] and Spanish words.

===Lexical stress===
[[Lexical stress]], coupled with [[glottalization]], is a [[distinctive feature]] in Tagalog. Primary stress normally occurs on either the final or the penultimate syllable of a word. Long vowel accompany primary or secondary stress unless the stress occurs at the end of a word.

Tagalog words are often distinguished from one another by the position of the stress and the presence of the glottal stop. In general, there are four types of phonetic emphases, which, in formal or academic settings, are indicated with a [[diacritic]] (''tuldík'') above the vowel. The penultimate primary stress position (''malumay'') is the default stress type and so is left unwritten except in dictionaries. The name of each stress type has its corresponding diacritic in the final vowel.

==Writing system==
{{see also|Filipino orthography}}
{{Contains Baybayin text}}

Tagalog, like other Philippines languages today, is written using the Latin alphabet. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]]–or [[alphasyllabary]]—called [[Baybayin]]. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.

In the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]] published his study on the ancient Tagalog script ''Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos'' and in 1887, published his essay ''El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog'' which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera's 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera's own orthography).&lt;ref name="Is k foreign 19"/&gt; A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter ⟨k⟩ rather than ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ to represent the phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}.

In 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog ''La España Oriental'' newspaper, of which [[Isabelo de los Reyes]] was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would "use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis". This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of ''La España'', [[Pascual H. Poblete]]'s ''Revista Católica de Filipina'' began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters "k" and "w" as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as "unpatriotic". The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as ''La Lectura Popular'' in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles.&lt;ref name="k is for"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Megan C.|title=K is for De-Kolonization: Anti-Colonial Nationalism and Orthographic Reform|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=8 October 2007|volume=49|issue=04|pages=938–967.|doi=10.1017/S0010417507000813}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Is k foreign 19"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accusations of Foreign-ness of the Revista Católica de Filipinas - Is ‘K’ a Foreign Agent?

In April 1890, Jose Rizal authored an article ''Sobre la Nueva Ortografia de la Lengua Tagalog'' in the Madrid-based periodical [[La Solidaridad]]. In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as "more perfect" than what he himself had developed.&lt;ref name="k is for"/&gt; The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="k is for"/&gt; The revolutionary society Kataás-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng̃ mg̃á Anak ng̃ Bayan or [[Katipunan]] made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.&lt;ref name="k is for"/&gt;

In 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country's [[national language]]. In 1940, the ''Balarílà ng Wikang Pambansâ'' ({{lang-en|Grammar of the National Language}}) of grammarian [[Lope K. Santos]] introduced the '''[[Abakada script|Abakada]]''' alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language.&lt;ref name="ebolusyon"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino | url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan | accessdate = 2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the ABAKADA was dropped and in its place is the expanded Filipino alphabet.

===Baybayin===
{{Main|Baybayin}}

Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]]—or [[alphasyllabary]]—called [[Baybayin]] prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular [[writing system]] was composed of symbols representing three [[vowel]]s and 14 [[consonant]]s. Belonging to the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, it shares similarities with the [[Old Kawi]] script of [[Javanese language|Java]] and is believed to be descended from the script used by the [[Bugis]] in [[Sulawesi]].

Although it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] taught by the Spaniards during their rule.

There has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an [[abugida]], or an [[alphasyllabary]], rather than an [[alphabet]]. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.

A "kudlit" resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an "E" or "I" sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an "O" or "U" sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, ''bundok'' being rendered as ''budo''), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.

Example:
&lt;div style="text-align:center; margin:1em 0;"&gt;[[File:Baybayin sample 02.jpg|Ba Be Bo B (in Baybayin)]]&lt;/div&gt;

Baybayin is encoded in Unicode version 3.2 in the range 1700-171F under the name "Tagalog".

====''ng'' and ''mga''====
{{See also|ng (digraph)}}
The [[Genitive case|genitive]] marker ''ng'' and the plural marker ''mga'' (e.g. ''Iyan ang '''mga''' damit ko.'' (Those are my clothe'''s''')) are abbreviations that are pronounced ''nang'' {{IPA|[naŋ]}} and ''mangá'' {{IPA|[mɐˈŋa]}}. ''Ng'', in most cases, roughly translates to "of" (ex. ''Siya ay kapatid '''ng''' nanay ko.'' She is the sibling ''of'' my mother) while ''nang'' usually means "when" or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix ''-ly'' in English adverbs), among other uses. 
* '''''Nang''' si Hudas ay nadulás.''—When [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] slipped.
* ''Gumising siya '''nang''' &lt;u&gt;maaga&lt;/u&gt;.''—He woke up &lt;u&gt;early&lt;/u&gt;.
* ''Gumalíng '''nang''' &lt;u&gt;{{sic|hide=y|todo}}&lt;/u&gt; si Juan dahil nag-ensayo siya.''—Juan &lt;u&gt;greatly&lt;/u&gt; improved because he practiced.

In the first example, ''nang'' is used in lieu of the word ''noong'' (when; ''&lt;u&gt;Noong&lt;/u&gt; si Hudas ay madulas''). In the second, ''nang'' describes that the person woke up (''gumising'') early (''maaga''); ''gumising nang maaga''. In the third, ''nang'' described up to what extent that Juan improved (''gumaling''), which is "greatly" (''nang {{sic|hide=y|todo}}''). In the latter two examples, the ligature ''na'' and its variants ''-ng'' and ''-g'' may also be used (''Gumising &lt;u&gt;na&lt;/u&gt; maaga/Maaga&lt;u&gt;ng&lt;/u&gt; gumising''; ''Gumaling &lt;u&gt;na&lt;/u&gt; {{sic|hide=y|todo}}/Todo&lt;u&gt;ng&lt;/u&gt; gumaling'').

The longer ''nang'' may also have other uses, such as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] that joins a repeated word:
*''Naghintáy sila '''nang''' naghintáy.''—They kept on waiting" (a closer calque: "They were waiting and waiting.")

===''pô/hô'' and ''opò/ohò''===
The words ''pô/hô'' and ''opò/ohò'' are traditionally used as polite iterations of the affirmative "''oo''" ("yes"). It is generally used when addressing elders or superiors such as bosses or teachers.

"Pô" and "opò" are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. "Hô" and "ohò" are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee's social rank and not their age. However, "pô" and "opò" can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.
*Example: "''Pakitapon naman '''pô/ho''' yung basura.''" ("Please throw away the trash.")

Used in the affirmative:
*Ex: "''Gutóm ka na ba?" "'''Opò/Ohò'''''". ("Are you hungry yet?" "Yes.")

''Pô/Hô'' may also be used in negation.
*Ex: "''Hindi ko '''pô/hô''' alam 'yan.''" ("I don't know that.")

==Vocabulary and borrowed words==
{{see also|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation|List of India-related topics in the Philippines}}

[[File:3D Image of Tagalog component Languages.png|thumb|A 3D pie-chart about the languages and loanwords that comprise the Tagalog language.]]
Tagalog vocabulary is composed mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - most of the words that end with the [[diphthongs]] -iw, (e.g. saliw) and those words that exhibit [[reduplication]] (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has a significant number of Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog.

Tagalog also includes many loanwords from English, [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), [[Chinese language|Chinese languages]] ([[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].

Due to trade with Mexico via the [[Manila galleon]]s from the 16th to the 19th centuries, many words from [[Nahuatl]] were introduced to Tagalog, but some of them were replaced by Spanish loanwords in the latter part of the Spanish colonization in the islands.

The Philippines has long been a melting pot of nations. The islands have been subject to different influences and a meeting point of numerous migrations since the early prehistoric origins of trading activities, especially from the time of the Neolithic Period, [[Silk Road]], [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] and [[Manila Galleon]] trading periods. This means that the evolution of the language is difficult to reconstruct (although many theories exist).

In pre-Hispanic times, [[Malay trade and creole languages|Trade Malay]] was widely known and spoken throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].

English has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, [[butterfly knife|balisong]], boondocks, [[jeepney]], Manila hemp, [[pancit]], ylang-ylang, and yaya, although the vast majority of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of [[Philippine English]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Religious literature==
Religious literature remains one of the most dynamic contributors to [[Tagalog literature]]. The first Bible in Tagalog, then called ''Ang Biblia''&lt;ref&gt;Worth, Roland H. ''Biblical Studies On The Internet: A Resource Guide'', 2008 (p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt; ("the Bible") and now called ''Ang Dating Biblia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adb.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm |title=Genesis 1 Tagalog: Ang Dating Biblia (1905) |publisher=Adb.scripturetext.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("the Old Bible"), was published in 1905. In 1970, the [[Philippine Bible Society]] translated the [[Bible]] into modern Tagalog. Even before the [[Second Vatican Council]], devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible
*the ''[[Magandang Balita Biblia]]'' (a parallel translation of the ''[[Good News Bible]]''), which is the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] version
*the [[Bibliya ng Sambayanang Pilipino]]
*the 1905 ''Ang Biblia'' is a more Protestant version
*the ''Bagong Sanlibutang Salin ng Banal na Kasulatan'' (''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'')

When the [[Second Vatican Council]], (specifically the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]], the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] was one of the first to translate the [[Roman Missal]] into Tagalog. The [[Roman Missal]] in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.

Jehovah's Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2003 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=155|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Watchtower]]'' (the primary magazine of Jehovah's Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah's Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/tl/wol/h/r27/lp-tg|title=Watchtower Online Library (Tagalog)|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic [[Bible translations]]. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, [[liturgy|liturgical]] prayers tend to be more [[ecumenism|ecumenical]].

==Examples==

===Lord's Prayer===
In Tagalog, the [[Lord's Prayer]] is exclusively known by its [[incipit]], ''Amá Namin'' (literally, "Our Father").

{{quote|''Amá namin, sumasalangit Ka

''Sambahín ang ngalan Mo.''

''Mapasaamin ang kaharián Mo.''

''Sundín ang loób Mo,''

''Dito sa lupà, gaya nang sa langit.''

''Bigyán Mo kamí ngayón ng aming kakanin sa araw-araw,''

''At patawarin Mo kamí sa aming mga salâ,''

''Para nang pagpápatawad namin,''

''Sa nagkakasalà sa amin;

''At huwág Mo kamíng ipahintulot sa tuksó,''

''At iadyâ Mo kamí sa lahát ng masamâ.''

''[Sapagkát sa Inyó ang kaharián, at ang kapangyarihan,''

''At ang kaluwálhatian, ngayón, at magpakailanman.]''

''Amen''}}

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
This is Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (''Pángkalahatáng Pagpapahayag ng Karapatáng Pantao'')

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bawat tao'y isinilang na may layà at magkakapantáy ang tagláy na dangál at karapatán. Silá'y pinagkalooban ng pangangatwiran at budhî na kailangang gamitin nilá sa pagtuturingan nilá sa diwà ng pagkakapatiran.''

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml The Universal Declaration of Human Rights], The United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Numbers===
The numbers (''mga numero'') in Tagalog language are of two sets. The first set consists of native Tagalog words and the other set are Spanish loanwords. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.) For example, when a person refers to the number "seven", it can be translated into Tagalog as "''pito''" or "''syete''" (Spanish: ''siete'').

===Months and days===
Months and days in Tagalog are also localised forms of Spanish months and days. "Month" in Tagalog is ''buwán'' (also the word for [[moon]]) and "day" is ''araw'' (the word also means [[sun]]). Unlike Spanish, however, months and days in Tagalog are always capitalised.

===Proverbs===
''Ang hindî marunong lumingón sa pinánggalingan ay hindî makaráratíng sa paroroonan''. (José Rizal)&lt;br /&gt;One who knows not how to look back from whence he came, will never get to where he is going.

''Tao ka nang humarap, bilang tao kitang haharapin.''&lt;br /&gt;(A proverb in Southern Tagalog that made people aware the significance of sincerity in Tagalog communities. It says, "As a human you reach me, I treat you as a human and never act as a traitor.")

''Hulí man daw at magalíng, nakákahábol pa rin. (Hulí man raw at magalíng, nakákahabol pa rin.)''&lt;br /&gt;If one is behind but capable, one will still be able to catch up.

''Magbirô ka na sa lasíng, huwág lang sa bagong gising''.&lt;br /&gt;Make fun of someone drunk, if you must, but never one who has just awakened.

''Aanhín pa ang damó kung patáy na ang kabayo?''&lt;br /&gt;What use is the grass if the horse is already dead?

''Ang sakít ng kalingkingan, ramdám ng buóng katawán.''&lt;br /&gt;The pain in the pinkie is felt by the whole body.&lt;br /&gt;
(In a group, if one goes down, the rest follow.)

''Nasa hulí ang pagsisisi.''&lt;br /&gt;Regret is always in the end.

''Pagkáhabà-habà man ng prusisyón, sa simbahan pa rin ang tulóy.''&lt;br /&gt;The [[procession]] may stretch on and on, but it still ends up at the church.&lt;br /&gt;
(In romance: refers to how certain people are destined to be married. In general: refers to how some things are inevitable, no matter how long you try and postpone it.)

''Kung 'dî mádaán sa santóng dasalan, daanin sa santóng paspasan.''&lt;br /&gt;If it cannot be got through holy prayer, get it through blessed force.&lt;br /&gt;
(In romance and courting: ''santóng paspasan'' literally means 'holy speeding' and is a euphemism for [[sexual intercourse]]. It refers to the two styles of courting by Filipino boys: one is the traditional, protracted, restrained manner favoured by older generations, which often featured [[Harana (serenade)|serenades]] and manual labour for the girl's parents; the other is upfront seduction, which may lead to a slap on the face or a pregnancy out of wedlock. The second conclusion is known as ''pikot'' or what Western cultures would call a '[[shotgun marriage]]'. This proverb is also applied in terms of diplomacy and negotiation.)

The '''Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival''' is an annual five-day [[literary festival]] in the city of [[New Orleans]].  The festival is dedicated to the [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer prize-winning]] American playwright [[Tennessee Williams]].  Every year, it features several events related to the long career of that writer, as well as writing workshops, panel discussions, literary readings, stage performances, a book fair, music, writing contests, and other events related to American literature, poetry, drama, opera, film, photography, art, history, culture, and cooking.  The signature event is the ''Stella and Stanley Shouting Contest'' that closes the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tennesseewilliams.net/index.php | title=Tennessee Williams Festival, Press Release |publisher=Tennesseewilliams.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The festival in New Orleans is not related to the '''Mississippi Delta Tennessee Williams Festival''' in [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coahomacc.edu/twilliams/ |title=Annual Mississippi Delta Tennessee Williams Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is held annually in October in the childhood hometown of Tennessee Williams.

== Origin ==
[[Tennessee Williams]] was not native to New Orleans, but he lived in [[French Quarter|New Orleans's French Quarter]] at several points in his adult life.  Two of his major plays, ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' and ''[[Vieux Carré (play)|Vieux Carré]]'', and several short stories were set in the historic French Quarter.  Shortly after Williams death in 1983, the city of New Orleans experienced an economic recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tennesseewilliams.net/faq/index.php?faq=history | title=Tennessee Williams Festival, FAQ |publisher=Tennesseewilliams.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the proposals to attract tourists back to the French Quarter and revitalize the local economy was the creation of a [[literary festival]] dedicated to Williams.  

The first Tennessee Williams Festival was a two-day event held in 1986, drawing an estimated 500 attendees.  However, the event quickly grew, and now attracts over 10,000 attendees every year.  In March 2006, the festival was also the first major festival to be held in New Orleans after [[Hurricane Katrina]], as the French Quarter was not flooded during the disaster.  Principal sponsors of the Festival include the [[Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[Historic New Orleans Collection]], the [[University of New Orleans]], [[Tulane University]], and the [[Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre|Le Petit Theatre]].

===  Events  ===

The five-day Festival is held on the weekend nearest March 26, the birthday of Tennessee Williams.  This is usually the fourth week of March.  Festival events are held at several sites around the French Quarter.  

Half of these events are either speakers or discussion panels, featuring experts from literature, theater, film, the arts, history, culture, and other topics.  In addition to these panels, there are [[master class]]es for aspiring writers, including advice from published writers, literary agents, and editors in the publishing industry.  The Festival also hosts musical performances by [[Music of New Orleans|local musicians]].  

Past speakers have included [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer-prize winning]] and [[Bestseller|best selling]] authors [[Edward Albee]], [[Robert Olen Butler]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Michael Cunningham]], [[Phillip Caputo]], [[Rick Bragg]], and [[Yusef Komunyakaa]].  Other speakers have included writers [[Anne Rice]], [[Cokie Roberts]], [[Michael Cunningham]], [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], [[Nora Roberts]], [[Stephen E. Ambrose]], [[Douglas Brinkley]], [[James Carville]], [[Andrei Codrescu]], [[Sue Grafton]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Larry Brown (author)|Larry Brown]], [[Margaret Walker]], [[Fannie Flagg]], [[Allen Gilchrist]], [[Kaye Gibbons]], [[Dorothy Allison]], [[Barry Gifford]], [[Rex Reed]], [[Peggy Scott Labrode]], and [[Errol Laborde]], as well as actors [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Stephanie Zimbalist]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[John Goodman]], [[Tab Hunter]], [[Dixie Carter]], [[Gerald McRaney]], [[Elizabeth Ashley]], [[Anne Jackson]], [[Eli Wallach]], and [[Kim Hunter]].  Tennessee Williams brother, Dakin Williams, was a frequent guest at the Festival until his death in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tennesseewilliams.net/index.php?topic=highlights | title=Tennessee Williams Festival, Highlights |publisher=Tennesseewilliams.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major feature of the Festival is its theatrical productions, including productions of full-length plays and one-act plays by Tennessee Williams himself, as well as other writers.  In 1992, the Festival began hosting a one-act play contest.  The winning plays are premiered at the Festival, and have become one of the Festival's most anticipated events.  The Festival also sponsors poetry and short fiction contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tennesseewilliams.net/index.php?topic=contests | title=Tennessee Williams Festival, Contests |publisher=Tennesseewilliams.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival highlights other [[Southern literature|contemporary Southern artists]], such as the New Orleans novelist [[John Kennedy Toole]] and [[Culture of New Orleans|other writers from New Orleans]].  However, Tennessee Williams remains the focus of the Festival.  His previously unpublished writings are often made public at the Festival, including premiere performances of newly discovered works.  A [[Academic conference|scholars conference]] is held every year, and an academic journal, [http://www.tennesseewilliamsstudies.org/journal/index.php ''The Tennessee Williams Annual Review''], is associated with this conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tennesseewilliamsstudies.org/conference/ | title=Tennessee Williams Scholar's Conference |publisher=Tennessee Williams Annual Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the first festival in 1986, there has been a guided walking tour to [[Vieux Carré (play)|722 Toulouse St.]] and other French Quarter residences where Williams once lived.  

And since 1996, the Festival has ended with the popular ''Stella and Stanley Shouting Contest'', a tribute to the third scene from [[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tennesseewilliams.net/article.php?story=contests.stella | title=Tennessee Williams Festival, Stella and Stanley Shouting Contest |publisher=Tennesseewilliams.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contest is open to the public and held on the last day of the Festival, usually Sunday afternoon, in [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]].  Actors playing the role of Stella and Stanely provoke the contestants from a gallery from one of the [[Pontalba Buildlings]], and after the first round of tryouts, a second round takes place, where finalists compete for prizes and trophies.

'''U.S. English''' is the umbrella name for two American [[politics|political]] [[advocacy group]]s founded in 1983 by former United States Senator [[S. I. Hayakawa|S.I.

The group operates two separate [[nonprofit]] entities out of its headquarters in [[Washington DC|Washington, D.C]].—U.S. English, Inc. and the U.S. English Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.us-english.org/view/17 Contact Us]." U.S. English. Retrieved on December 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauro E. Mujica has been the Chair and CEO of U.S. English since 1993. He was educated at [[Columbia University]] and holds bachelor's and master's degrees in [[Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Chairman of the Board/CEO Mauro E.

An architect by trade, Mujica was the Chairman/CEO of the Pace Group, an international architecture and planning firm, from 1983 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mauro E. Mujica LinkedIn profile|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mauro-e-mujica/1b/689/732}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is fluent in five languages.

=== Advisory board members ===
Early advisory board members included [[Alistair Cooke]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Norman Cousins]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[Norman Podhoretz]]. Some of them are no longer affiliated with the group. Schwarzenegger is still a board member. The gallerist [[André Emmerich]] (d. 2007), [[Charles Scripps]], [[Togo Tanaka]] and the Nobel Prize laureate [[Rosalyn Yalow]] (d. 2007) were among the other past members of the advisory board.

Current members of the Advisory Board include: Edward A. Capano, [[Denton Cooley]], M.D., [[Midge Decter]], Jorge Delgado, Dinesh Desai, Mrs. [[Richard DeVos]], [[George Gilder]], [[Nathan Glazer]], Ph.D., Charles Gogolak, [[Lee Majors]], [[Laura McKenzie]], Harvey Meyerhoff, [[Barbara Mujica (writer)|Barbara Mujica]], Ph.D., [[Alex Olmedo]], [[Arnold Palmer]], Margie Petersen, [[Norman Podhoretz]], Donald M. Ross, Randolph Rowland, [[James Schlesinger]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Norman D. Shumway]], Rodney Smith, [[Alex Trebek]], George W. Wilson, and Roger Wildermuth .&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.usenglish.org/view/309 Advisory Board]."&lt;/ref&gt;   To date, the United States federal government has recognized [[Languages in the United States#Official language status|no official language]], even though nearly all federal, state and local government business is conducted in English. Some states and territories do have English as an official language; a few have passed laws embracing another language alongside English, such as [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] in the state of [[Hawaii]]. In total, 32 states have English as their official language. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] passed English as the official language in 1996, but the Senate did not act on the measure before the conclusion of the 104th Congress.

== Position ==
For U.S. English, making English the official language of the United States means that all government business must be conducted in English "with commonsense exceptions" of necessity, such as disseminating public-health information to non-English speaking communities.

Opponents of the goals of the U.S. English organization or of English as ''the'' official language object that the practice would express a bias against immigrants who have yet to learn English. In response, U.S. English argues that this would encourage immigrants to learn English more quickly, thereby reaping greater economic and political benefits. Thus, in the view of many supporters of this approach—including members of other English-only advocacy groups—the move to make English the only official language can have benefits for non-English speakers, and is not a form of legalized discrimination.

=== Controversy ===
[[Walter Cronkite]] was once a board member of the organization, and [[Linda Chavez]] was once executive director. A leak by the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' newspaper of a memo from [[John Tanton]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=125 Memo to WITAN IV Attendees from John Tanton] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105145438/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=125 |date=2014-11-05 }}." ''[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]''. Retrieved on December 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which many including Cronkite, who called the memo "embarrassing", believed went too far in its characterization of Latinos, prompted Chavez and Cronkite to resign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} John Tanton was ousted from the group in 1988 following the leak of the memo, and is no longer associated with it; he later went on to found his own group, [[ProEnglish]].&lt;ref&gt;https://proenglish.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">'''UTX''' ('''Universal Terminology eXchange''') is a simple glossary format. UTX is developed by AAMT ([[Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation]]).  

A tab-separated text format that contains minimal information, such as source language entry, target language entry, and part-of-speech entry. UTX is intended to facilitate rapid creation and quick exchanges of human-readable and machine-readable glossaries. 

Initially, UTX was created to absorb the differences between various user dictionary formats for [[machine translation]]. The  scope of the format was later expanded to include other purposes, such as glossaries for human translations, [[natural language processing]], [[thesaurus]], [[text-to-speech]], [[input method]], etc. 

UTX could be used to improve the efficiency of [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] for [[open source]] projects.

== UTX Converter ==

UTX Converter was developed as an [[open source]] project by AAMT. UTX Converter is available for free.

It has the following functions:
* Functions for UTX
** The format check of a UTX file (UTX 1.11)
** Extraction of forbidden terms
** Extraction of the pairs of forbidden terms and approved terms
** Extraction of the pairs of non-standard terms and approved terms
* Conversion function
** Conversion between UTX and a user dictionary (*. txt file) of ATLAS (Fujitsu)
** Conversion between UTX and a user dictionary (*. txt file) of The Honyaku (Toshiba)
** Conversion between UTX and a user dictionary (*.opt file for EJ, *.dic file for JE) of PC/MED/PAT/Legal Transer (Cross Language)
** Conversion from UTX to a text for MultiTerm import
