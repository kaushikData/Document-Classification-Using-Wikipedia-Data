'''Anita LaFrance Allen-Castellitto''' (born March 24, 1953&lt;ref&gt;date &amp; year of birth, full name according to LCNAF [[Cataloging in Publication|CIP]] data&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[Henry R. Silverman]] Professor of Law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]]. She is also Vice Provost for Faculty.  She has been a senior fellow in the former bioethics department of the [[University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine]], a collaborating faculty member in [[Africana studies]], and an affiliated faculty member in the gender, sexuality and women's studies program. In 2010 President Barack Obama named Allen to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. She is a [[Hastings Center]] Fellow.

==Biography==
Anita L. Allen, also known as Anita Lafrance Allen-Castellitto, was born in [[Fort Worden]] ([[Port Townsend, Washington]]) in 1953. Her parents, Carrye Mae Allen (née Cloud) and Grover Cleveland Allen, were both natives of [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Allen's father made a career in the [[United States Army]], serving in both the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Her father was a member of "Operation Kapers," a squad of enlisted men who entertained combat soldiers in Korea with song, dance, and comedy. Allen spent her childhood living on military bases, including [[Fort Benning]], Georgia, and [[Schofield Barracks]], Hawaii.

Allen was one of six children. Her brother, Michael Patrick Allen, began working as an environmental lawyer for [[Microsoft]] in 2008. Other siblings are Cynthia Ann Allen Jackson and Monica Lynne Allen Newell, both of whom have worked for the federal government, Newell for the [[Centers for Disease Control]]. Their brother Grover Cleveland Allen, Jr, is a professional engineer employed by the [[General Electrics|GE corporation]]; and Andre Ramon Allen made a career as a Master Sergeant in the [[United States Air Force]] and later became a paralegal.

===Marriage and family===
In 1985, Allen married Paul Vincent Castellitto, a lawyer from [[New Rochelle, New York]], who specialized in white collar criminal defense law. The pair adopted two children.

An earlier marriage in 1982 to artist Michael Kelly Williams of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] ended in divorce. Allen was the model for Williams' woodcut, ''Afternoon of a Georgia Faun.'' An original version of the woodcut was printed at the acclaimed printmaking workshop of [[Robert Blackburn (artist)|Robert Blackburn]] and now is held in the permanent print collection of the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C.

In 2006, Allen became an elder of the [[Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church]].

==Honors and awards==
Allen is one of several successful black professionals whose experiences and perspectives have been profiled in books including [[Laurel Holliday]]'s ''Children of the Dream'' (2000), [[Ellis Cose]]'s ''The Rage of a Privileged Class'' (1994), [[George Yancy]]'s ''African American Philosophers: 17 Conversations'' (1998,) and [[Elwood Watson]]: ''Outsiders Within'' (2008). She was featured in [[Carlin Romano]]'s 2007 article, "A Challenge for Philosophy." Of her, he writes, "Penn's Anita Allen is at the top of her field, but she has serious concerns about its lack of openness and diversity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlin Romano]], "A Challenge for Philosophy," ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 President [[Barack Obama]] appointed Allen to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues.

In 2016 Allen was elected to the National Academy of Medicine.

In 2017 Allen was elected Vice President and President Elect of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association, the first African American woman to hold the post in any Division of the Association.

==Education==
Allen graduated an honor student from [[Baker High School (Columbus, Georgia)|Baker High School]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1970 in just three years. Allen holds a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[New College of Florida]], on whose board of trustees she later served. Allen has twice delivered the commencement address at New College. While enrolled at New College, Allen spent a year studying in Italy and Germany. Under the direction of Professor [[Bryan Norton]], she completed an undergraduate thesis on the philosophy of logical positivist [[Rudolf Carnap]].

Allen received her [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in philosophy from the [[University of Michigan]]. Allen received training in analytic philosophy at the University of Michigan, where she also studied modern dance, alongside classmate [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].

Professor [[Richard Brandt]], a noted proponent of moral utilitarianism, advised Allen's doctoral thesis, "Rights, Children and Education."  Her dissertation examined Thomas Hobbes' and John Locke's theories of parental authority, and the moral ideal of a right to education. She argued for greater autonomy for children. Allen was one of the first African-American women to earn a PhD in Philosophy, along with [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], [[LaVerne Shelton]], and [[Adrian Piper]].  She is the first African-American woman to hold both a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] and Ph.D. in philosophy.

Allen received her J.D. from [[Harvard Law School]]. While attending Harvard, Allen served as a teaching fellow for professors [[Michael Sandel]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Sissela Bok]]. She worked as a summer law Associate at the [[Gaston Snow Ely Bartlett]] law firm in Boston and at [[Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy]] in New York.

==Professional career==
Prior to joining the Penn faculty, Allen was professor and associate dean for research and scholarship at [[Georgetown University Law Center]] from 1987 to 1998, and an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] from 1978 to 1981. She was the first African American woman to serve on the faculty of the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]], 1985 to 1987. She has been a visiting faculty member at [[Waseda University]] Law School in Tokyo, [[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]], [[University of Washington]], [[Hofstra Law School]], [[University of Arizona College of Law]], [[Princeton University]], [[Yale Law School]], [[Villanova University School of Law]], and [[Harvard Law School]].

Allen is an expert on privacy law and contemporary ethics. She is also recognized for scholarship about legal philosophy, women's rights, and race relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leiterrankings.com/faculty/2007faculty_impact_areas.shtml#LawandPhilosophy|title=Brian Leiter Most Cited Law Professors by Specialty, 2000-2007|website=www.LeiterRankings.com|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has received fellowships from Princeton's Program in Law and Public Affairs, the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], the [[American Association of University Women]], and the [[Ford Foundation]].

Allen is a member of the Pennsylvania and New York bars. She briefly practiced law with [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]] in New York City in 1984 and 1985.

'''Ariadne auf Naxos''' (''Ariadne on Naxos'') is a [[Melodrama#Melodrama in opera and song|duodrama]] in one act by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[composer]] [[Jiří Antonín Benda]] (also Georg Benda) with a [[German language|German]] libretto by {{Interlanguage link multi|Johann Christian Brandes|de}}. It was commissioned by [[Abel Seyler]], whose [[Seyler theatrical company|theatrical company]] arrived in Gotha in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;http://solo.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553345&amp;catNum=553345&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[opera]]'s first performance was at the [[Schloss Friedenstein]], [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], on 27 January 1775.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fintro.files/bintro.files/operas/Ariadne_auf_Naxos(Ariadne_on_Naxos)(Giri_Antonio_Benda).htm Ariadne auf Naxos (Ariadne on Naxos) (Giri Antonio Benda)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background and musical analysis==
''Ariadne auf Naxos'' belonged to the genre known as German [[melodrama]],&lt;ref name=AllMedia&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ariadne-auf-naxos-melodrama "Ariadne auf Naxos, melodrama"]. Classical Work Reviews. All Media Guide, 2009. Accessed 2 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; an attempt is to merge spoken dialogue with music, making it the only form of opera with no singing. Brandes wrote the text of ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' for his wife [[Charlotte Wilhelmina Franziska Brandes|Charlotte]], a famous singer and actress of the day.  She played the part of Ariadne in the premiere.  The basis for Brandes' libretto was a [[cantata]] by [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg]]. However, Tim Ashley in his review of a 2005 performance of the work, suggests that Brandes may have been influenced by [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', "Theseus is a man of destiny and conscience; Ariadne has no Bacchus to redeem her and instead commits suicide after seeing Theseus sail away".&lt;ref name=Ashley&gt;Ashley, Tim,[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,5270017-116899,00.html "Ariadne auf Naxos/Zaide"]. ''[[The Guardian]]'', 25 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mozart]] attended a production of ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' and became a great admirer of Benda's compositions. In 1778 he wrote to his father expressing the desire to compose a duodrama entitled ''Semiramide'' on the model of Benda's ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' and ''[[Medea (Benda)|Medea]]''. He believed at the time that melodrama was the way to solve the problems of operatic recitative. However, Mozart never got around to creating a duodrama. He did create a miniature melodrama within his unfinished operetta, ''[[Zaide]]'', written in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Jahn, Otto, [https://archive.org/details/lifeofmozart02jahnuoft ''Life of Mozart''], Novello, 1982, pp. 27 and 123-125&lt;/ref&gt; Other composers who admired and were influenced by Benda's melodramas include [[Carl Maria von Weber]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].&lt;ref name=Ashley/&gt;

==Performance history==
[[Image:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]]: Dionysus discovers Ariadne on the shore of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]. The painting also depicts the constellation named after Ariadne.]]
Although not performed often, Benda's ''Ariadne'' has remained in the performance repertoire since it first premiered and a number of recordings of the work have been made. Most recently, the work was performed in August 2005 at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] in a double bill with [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Zaide]]''. The cast included [[Dagmar Manzel]] as Ariadne and {{Interlanguage link multi|Rainer Trost|de}} as Theseus. [[Charles Mackerras]] conducted the [[English National Opera]] orchestra.&lt;ref name=Ashley /&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[Ariadne]] is sleeping on the shore of the island of [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], as [[Theseus]], her lover, looks down on her resting form. Theseus feels there is a destiny placed upon him and feels that he can not stay tied to Ariadne and fulfill that destiny. He slips away from Ariadne on his ship, leaving her stranded alone on Naxos. Ariadne awakes to find herself deserted by the faithless Theseus. Ariadne despairs and commits suicide.

''Attraction'' may also refer to the object of the attraction itself, as in ''[[tourist attraction]]''.

==Visual attractiveness==
Visual attractiveness or visual appeal is attraction produced primarily by [[visual perception|visual stimuli]].

==Physical attractiveness==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is the perception of the physical traits of an individual [[human]] [[person]] as pleasing or [[beauty|beautiful]]. It can include various implications, such as [[sexual attractiveness]], [[cuteness]], [[Interpersonal attraction#Similarity (like-attracts-like)|similarity]] and [[physical attractiveness|physique]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Physical attractiveness can also include the attraction of smell. Pheromones secreted by animals and humans alike can attract others, and this is viewed as being attracted to smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/14/science-of-attraction-_n_6661522.html|title=The Strange Science Of Sexual Attraction|last=Gregoire|first=Carolyn|date=2015-02-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=HuffPo isn't the best possible source for medicine related topics|date=June 2018}} [[Human sex pheromones]] may play a role in human attraction, although it is unclear how well humans can actually pick up on the pheromones of another. 

Judgment of attractiveness of physical traits is partly universal to all human cultures, partly dependent on culture or [[society]] or time period, partly biological, and partly subjective and individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hönekopp | first = Johannes | authorlink = | title = Once more: Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Relative contributions of private and shared taste to judgments of facial attractiveness | publisher = APA| year = 2006 | url = http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/hsw/psychologie/professuren/allpsy2/Artikel/JEPHPP_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognitive_emotions_1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Review_Ortony_1989"/&gt;

==The Science Behind Attraction==
According to a study determining the golden ratio for facial beauty, the most attractive face is one with average distances between facial features, and an average length and width of the face itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pallett|first=Pamela|last2=Link|first2=Stephen|last3=Lee|first3=Kang|date=November 6, 2009|title=New "Golden" Ratios for Facial Beauty|pmc=2814183|journal=Vision Research|volume=50|pages=149–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Facial attractiveness, or [[beauty]], can also be determined by symmetry. If a face is asymmetrical, this can indicate unhealthy genetic information. Therefore, if a face is symmetrical (see [[Facial symmetry]]), healthy genetic information is implied. People will judge potential mates based off the physical expression of the genetic health, which is their apparent attractiveness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=B.C.|last2=Little|first2=A.C.|last3=Penton-Voak|first3=I.S.|last4=Tiddeman|first4=B.P.|last5=Burt|first5=D.M.|last6=Perrett|first6=D.I.|date=November 2001|title=Facial symmetry and judgements of apparent health: Support for a “good genes” explanation of the attractiveness–symmetry relationship|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513801000836|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=22|pages=417-420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This supports the good genes theory, which indicates that attractiveness is seen as a way to ensure that offspring will have the healthiest genes and therefore the best chance of survival. Certain trains that indicate good genes (such as clear skin or facial symmetry) are seen as desirable when choosing a partner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/good-genes-hypothesis|title=Good genes hypothesis|last=The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Brittanica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Sexual Selection and Attraction in Non-human Animals==

Among animals, females often are "choosy" about who they pick for a mate. They will look for characteristics in their potential mates that ensure their offspring will have healthy genetic material. Therefore, they will be attracted to certain traits or behaviors of their potential mates. Attraction among animals is based mostly on what will give the females the best chance of having the most and healthiest offspring that will likely survive to adulthood because of the traits they will inherit from the male&lt;ref&gt; Alcock, J. (2001). The Evolution of Reproductive Behavior. In Animal Behavior. (7 ed. pp. 341) Sunderland, Massachusetts: Arizona State University. &lt;/ref&gt;. Females will look for signs of health in the males, such as large and fancy adornments, bright colors, or other features that the male will only have if he is in good health. &lt;ref&gt;Bateson, P. Editor. (1983). Sexual Selection by Female Choice by Peter O'Donald. in Mate Choice. (pp.&amp;nbsp;53). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Eye candy (slang for visual appeal)==
Eye candy is a slang term for superficial attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/marathi/features/the-english-we-speak/ep-151103 |title=The English We Speak |date=November 3, 2015 |work=BBC |accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article about the potential for [[cheerleading]] at the Olympics, eye candy was used to describe cheerleaders as "entertainment popularized by professional sports in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is cheerleading coming to the Olympics? |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2017/02/18/cheerleading-coming-olympics/13A4niz8VlbbE6O9enqYqO/story.html |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=February 18, 2017 |access-date=September 27, 2017 |first=Shira |last=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-ryan-ending-nfl-cheerleaders-spt-0107-20160107-column.html |title=Time for NFL to end use of cheerleaders |date=January 7, 2016 |access-date=September 27, 2017|first=Shannon |last=Ryan |newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been used in professional sports in the United States referring to female athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's Time For Sports Broadcasting To Stop Relegating Women to Sideline Eye Candy |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/annedoyle/2013/01/21/its-time-for-sports-broadcasting-to-stop-relegating-women-to-sideline-eye-candy/#4d6ef74e3fc9 |work=Forbes |date=January 21, 2017 |access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Bosanquet''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|z|ən|ˌ|k|ɛ|t|,_|-|k|ɪ|t}}; 14 June&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b685331;view=1up;seq=13''Bernard Bosanquet''] by [[Helen Bosanquet]], London, 1924, p. 7. Many printed sources report a different, incorrect date, 14 July. The original source of this error is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; 1848 – 8 February 1923) was a British philosopher and [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], and an influential figure on matters of political and social policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work influenced  but was later subject to criticism by many thinkers, notably [[Bertrand Russell]], [[John Dewey]] and [[William James]]. Bernard was the husband of [[Charity Organisation Society]] leader [[Helen Bosanquet]].

==Life==
Born at Rock Hall near [[Alnwick]], Bosanquet was the son of Robert William Bosanquet, a Church of England clergyman. He was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. After graduation, he was elected to a Fellowship at [[University College, Oxford]], but, after receiving a substantial inheritance, resigned it in order to devote himself to philosophical research. He moved to London in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bernard-Bosanquet&lt;/ref&gt; where he became an active member of the [[London Ethical Society]] and the [[Charity Organisation Society]]. Both were positive demonstrations of Bosanquet's ethical philosophy. Bosanquet published on a wide range of topics, such as [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[aesthetics]] and politics. In his metaphysics, he is regarded as a key representative (with [[F.H. Bradley]]) of Absolute Idealism, although it is a term that he abandoned in favour of "speculative philosophy."

He was one of the leaders of the so-called [[neo-Hegelian]] philosophical movement in Great Britain. He was strongly influenced by the ancient [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]]s [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], but also by the German philosophers [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Among his best-known works are ''The Philosophical Theory of the State'' (1899), his [[Gifford lectures]], ''The Principle of Individuality and Value'' (1912) and ''The Value and Destiny of the Individual'' (1913).

Bosanquet was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1894 to 1898.

==Idealist social theory==

In his ''Encyclopedia'', Section 95, [[Hegel]] had written about "the ideality of the finite." This obscure, seemingly meaningless, phrase was interpreted as implying that "what is finite is not real"&lt;ref name="Ency"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 3, "Idealism", New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; because the ideal is understood as being the opposite of the real. Bosanquet was a follower of Hegel and the "central theme of Bosanquet's idealism was that every finite existence necessarily transcends itself and points toward other existences and finally to the whole. Thus, he advocated a system very close to that in which Hegel had argued for the ideality of the finite."&lt;ref name="Ency" /&gt;

The relation of the finite individual to the whole state in which he/she lives was investigated in Bosanquet's ''Philosophical Theory of the State'' (London, 1899). In this book, he "argued that the state is the real individual and that individual persons are unreal by comparison with it."&lt;ref name="Ency" /&gt; But Bosanquet did not think that the state has a right to impose social control over its individual citizens. "On the contrary, he believed that if society is organic and individual, then its elements can cooperate apart from a centralised organ of control, the need for which presupposes that harmony has to be imposed upon something that is naturally unharmonious."&lt;ref name="Ency" /&gt;

The relationship between the individual and society was summarised in Bosanquet's preface to ''The Introduction to Hegel's Philosophy of Fine Art'' (1886):

{{block quote|Man's Freedom, in the sense thus contemplated, lies in the spiritual or supra-sensuous world by which his humanity is realized, and in which his will finds fulfilment. The family, for example, property, and law are the first steps of man's freedom. In them the individual's will obtains and bestows recognition as an agent in a society whose bond of union is ideal — i.e. existing only in consciousness ; and this recognition develops into duties and rights. It is in these that man finds something to live for, something in which and for the sake of which to assert himself. As society develops he lives on the whole more in the civilized or spiritual world, and less in the savage or purely natural world. His will, which is himself, expands with the institutions and ideas that form its purpose, and the history of this expansion is the history of human freedom. Nothing is more shallow,more barbarously irrational, than to regard the progress of civilization as the accumulation of restrictions. Laws and rules are a necessary aspect of extended capacities. (p. xxvii)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/introductiontohe00hege/introductiontohe00hege_djvu.txt|title=The Introduction to Hegel's Philosophy of Fine Art|year=1886|publisher=Kegan Paul Trench &amp; Co|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Robert Kenneth Meyer''' (27 May 1932 – 6 May 2009) was a logician and Professor Emeritus at the [[Australian National University]].

First trained to be a minister at the Union Congregational Church by the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in 1956, he completed his graduate studies in [[philosophy]] and [[logic]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He moved to Australia and joined the [[Australian National University]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/ Home page of Bob Meyer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515214454/http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/ |date=15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in [[relevant logic]], particularly on its semantics.{{clarify|date=May 2009}}

He was the Maximum Leader for the [[Logicians Liberation League]], and drafted its manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/manifesto.html Logicians Liberation League Manifesto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611111047/http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/manifesto.html |date=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his accomplishments in the areas of philosophy and logic, he fell short in the understanding of the passage of time. On one of his journeys from Philadelphia Pennsylvania to Washington DC, he estimated that the 150 mile drive would take him "Three or four or five hours". On one occasion he lost his passport in the USA one hour prior to his flight to Australia and estimated he had enough time to get a new one "after a shower and a quick stop at the Barnes and Noble".

==Death==
Meyer died of [[lung cancer]] on 6 May 2009, aged 76, in [[Canberra, Australia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46024">{{other uses|Compassion (disambiguation)}}
'''Compassion''' motivates people to go out of their way to help the physical, mental, or emotional pains of another and themselves. Compassion is often regarded as having sensitivity, an emotional aspect to suffering, though when based on cerebral notions such as fairness, justice, and interdependence, it may be considered rational in nature and its application understood as an activity also based on sound judgment. There is also an aspect of equal dimension, such that individual's compassion is often given a property of "depth", "vigour", or "[[passion (emotion)|passion]]". The etymology of "compassion" is Latin, meaning "co-suffering." Compassion involves "feeling for another" and is a precursor to [[empathy]], the "feeling as another" capacity for better person centered acts of active compassion; in common parlance active compassion is the [[desire (emotion)|desire]] to alleviate another's suffering.&lt;ref name="sjsl"&gt;Sherlyn Jimenez, see article on ''Compassion'', The Encyclopedia of Positive Psychology, Volume I, Editor: Shane Lopez, Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion involves allowing ourselves to be moved by suffering, and experiencing the motivation to help alleviate and prevent it. An act of compassion is defined by its [[helpfulness]]. Qualities of compassion are patience and wisdom; kindness and perseverance; warmth and resolve. It is often, though not inevitably, the key component in what manifests in the social context as [[altruism]]. Expression of compassion is prone to be hierarchical, paternalistic and controlling in responses.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2010"/&gt; Difference between sympathy and compassion is that the former responds to suffering with sorrow and concern while the latter responds with warmth and care.&lt;ref name="CompInteg"/&gt;

The English [[noun]] ''compassion'', meaning ''to love together with'', comes from [[Latin]]. Its [[prefix]] ''com-'' comes directly from ''com'', an archaic version of the Latin [[preposition]] and affix [[wikt:cum|cum]] (= with); the ''-passion'' segment is derived from ''passus'', [[past participle]] of the [[deponent verb]] [[wikt:patior|patior, patī, passus sum]]. Compassion is thus related in origin, form and meaning to the English noun [[patient]] (= one who suffers), from ''patiens'', [[present participle]] of the same [[wikt:patior|patior]], and is akin to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb πάσχειν (= ''paskhein'', to suffer) and to its [[cognate]] noun [[wikt:πάθος|πάθος]] (= [[pathos]]).&lt;ref name="newSOED"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;{{cite book |author=Partridge, Eric |title=Origins: a short etymological dictionary of modern English |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1966 |pages= |isbn=0-02-594840-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranked a great virtue in numerous [[philosophy|philosophies]], compassion is considered in almost all the major [[religion|religious traditions]] as among the greatest of [[virtue]]s.

== Theories ==
Theoretical perspectives of compassion have been developed through the years, the following three proposed perspectives show contrasts in their evolution and approaches to compassion.
:* Compassion is simply a variation of love or sadness, not a distinct emotion.&lt;ref name="Shaver et. al: Emotion Knowledge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaver|first=P|author2=J Schwartz |author3=D Kirson |author4=C O'Connor |title=Emotion knowledge: further exploration of a prototype approach|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=June 1987|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1061–1086|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.6.1061 |pmid=3598857}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, compassion can be viewed as a distinct emotional state, which can be differentiated from distress, [[sadness]], and [[love]].&lt;ref name="Bowlby: Attach and loss vol. 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=John|title=Attachment: Attachment and Loss Volume One|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Moral Emotions: Haidt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|title=The Moral Emotions|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=852–870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Social Functionalism and the Evolution of Emotions: Keltner et al"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keltner|first=Dacher|title=Social Functionalism and the Evolution of Emotions|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|pages=115–142|author2=Jonathan Haidt |author3=Michelle Shiota}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Compassion as a synonym of empathic distress, which is characterized by the feeling of distress in connection with another person's suffering.&lt;ref name="Compassion: An Evolutionary Analysis and Empirical Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goetz|first=Jennifer|author2=Dacher Kelter |author3=Emiliana Simon-Thomas |title=Compassion: An Evolutionary Analysis and Empirical Review|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2010|volume=136|issue=3|pages=351–374|doi=10.1037/a0018807|pmid=20438142|pmc=2864937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekman|first=Paul|title=Emotions Revealed: Recognizing Faces and Feelings to improve communication and emotional life|year=2003|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Martin|title=Is altruism part of human nature?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1981|volume=40|issue=1|pages=121–137|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective of compassion is based on the finding that people sometimes emulate and feel the emotions of people around them.&lt;ref name="Hatfield, 1993: Emotional Contagion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatfield|first=Elaine|author2=John Cacioppo|title=Emotional Contagion|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=1993|volume=2|issue=3|pages=96–99|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953|last3=Rapson|first3=Richard L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more one person knows about the human condition and the associated experiences, the more vivid the route to identification with suffering becomes.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassell|first=Eric|title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-518724-3|pages=393–403|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying with another person is an essential process for human beings, it is commonly seen throughout the world as people adapt and change with new styles of clothing, language, behavior, etc., which is even illustrated by infants who begin to mirror the facial expressions and body movements of their mother as early as the first days of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzoff|first=Andrew|title=The Roots of Social and Cognitive Development: Models of Man's Original Nature|journal=Social Perception in Infants|year=1985|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personality psychology]] agrees that people are inherently different and distinct from one another, which leads to the conclusion that human suffering is always individual and unique. Suffering can result from psychological, social, and physical trauma&lt;ref name="cassell1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassell|first=Eric|title=The Healer's Art|year=1995|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53062-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it happens in acute forms as often as chronically.&lt;ref name="cassell1995"/&gt; Due to the inherent differences in people's personalities some may define their early stages of suffering to their external circumstances and those life events being quiet or not discussed. The later stages may involve the person expressing their [[victimization]] and searching for help.&lt;ref name="Models of Point Suffering"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reich|first=Warren|title=Models of Point Suffering: Foundations for an Ethic Compassion |journal=Acta Neurochirugica|year=1987|volume=38|pages=117–122|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-6975-9_20|series=Acta Neurochirurgica Supplementum|isbn=978-3-7091-7457-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suffering]] has been defined as the perception of a person's impending destruction or loss of integrity, which continues until the threat is vanished or the person's integrity can be restored.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; The importance of identifying with others for compassion is contrasted by the negative physical and psychological effects of [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]]. Compassion is often a characteristic element of democratic societies.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Compassion is recognized through identifying with other people, the knowledge of human behavior, the perception of suffering, transfer of feelings, knowledge of goal and purpose changes in sufferers, and leads to the absence of the suffering from the group.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt;

The compassion process is highly related to identifying with the other person because sympathizing with others is possible among people from other countries, cultures, locations, etc. A possible source of this process of identifying with others comes from a universal category called "Spirit." Toward the late 1970s, very different cultures and nations around the world took a turn to [[religious fundamentalism]], which has occasionally been attributed to "Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegal|first=Georg|title=Phenomenology of Spirit|year=1952|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824597-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of compassion as a factor contributing to individual or societal behavior has been the topic of continuous debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Lee |title=Compassion and Societal Well-Being|journal=Pacific Philosophical Quarterly|date=1 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the process of identifying with other people, a complete absence of compassion may require ignoring or disapproving identification with other people or groups.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Earlier studies established the links between interpersonal violence and cruelty which leads to indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Frank R. Ascione, Phil Arkow Child abuse, domestic violence, and animal abuse: linking the circles of compassion for prevention and intervention {{ISBN|1-55753-142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randall Lockwood, Frank R. Ascione. Cruelty to Animals and Interpersonal Violence. Purdue University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been illustrated throughout history: [[The Holocaust]], [[Genocide]], [[European colonization of the Americas]], etc. The seemingly essential step in these atrocities could be the defining of the victims as "not human" or "not us." The atrocities committed throughout human history have only been relieved through the presence of compassion.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alisdair|title=A Short History of Ethics|year=1966|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=0-203-13112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion may have the ability to induce feelings of kindness and [[forgiveness]], which could give people the ability to stop situations that have the potential to be distressing and occasionally lead to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goetz|first=J|author2=D Keltner |author3=E Simon-Thomas  |title=Compassion: An evolutionary analysis and empirical review|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2010 |volume=136|issue=3|pages=351–374|doi=10.1037/a0018807|pmid=20438142 |pmc=2864937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===
Compassion has become associated with and researched in the fields of [[positive psychology]] and social psychology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jazaieri|first=Hooria|last2=Jinpa|first2=Geshe Thupten|last3=McGonigal|first3=Kelly|last4=Rosenberg|first4=Erika L.|last5=Finkelstein|first5=Joel|last6=Simon-Thomas|first6=Emiliana|last7=Cullen|first7=Margaret|last8=Doty|first8=James R.|last9=Gross|first9=James J.|date=2012-07-25|title=Enhancing Compassion: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Compassion Cultivation Training Program|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9373-z|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=1113–1126|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9373-z|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Dalai Lama]] once said that "compassion is a necessity, not a luxury"&lt;ref name="CompInteg"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reddy, Nanda Kishore|author2=Ajmera, Santosh|title=Ethics, Integrity and Aptitude|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLlyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-93-5134-236-6|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "it is a question of human survival".&lt;ref name="Lama1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=H.H. the Fourteenth Dalai Lama|title=Policy of Kindness: An Anthology of Writings by and about the Dalai Lama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_GZ4LRsqEegC&amp;pg=PA112|year=1990|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-769-8|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassion is a process of connecting by identifying with another person. This identification with others through compassion can lead to increased motivation to do something in an effort to relieve the suffering of others.

Compassion is an evolved function from the harmony of a three grid internal system: contentment-and-peace system, goals-and-drives system and threat-and-safety system. Paul Gilbert defines these collectively as necessary regulated systems for compassion.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gilbert|title=The Compassionate Mind: A New Approach to Life's Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krNPL6xCVL0C|year=2010|publisher=New Harbinger  Publications|isbn=978-1-57224-840-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In examination of the motivated regulation of compassion in the context of large-scale crises, such as natural disasters and genocides, much research has established that people tend to feel more compassion for single identifiable victims than large masses of victims (the [[Identifiable victim effect]]). It is found that people only show less compassion for many victims than for single victims of disasters when they expect to incur a financial cost upon helping. This [[collapse of compassion]] depends on having the motivation and ability to regulate emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron &amp; Payne, 2011, JPSP&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory research, psychologists are exploring how concerns about becoming emotionally exhausted may motivate people to curb their compassion for—and dehumanize—members of stigmatized social groups, such as homeless individuals and drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Harris, &amp; Payne, in prep&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion consists of three major requirements: People must feel that troubles that evoke their feelings are serious, the understanding that sufferers' troubles are not self-inflicted, and ability to picture oneself with the same problems in a non-blaming and non-shaming manner.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt;

=== Neuropsychology ===
In a 2009 small [[fMRI]] experiment, Mary Helen Immordino-Yang and colleagues at the [[Brain and Creativity Institute]] studied strong feelings of compassion for social and physical pain in others. Both feelings involved an expected change in activity in the anterior [[insular cortex|insula]], [[anterior cingulate]], [[hypothalamus]], and [[midbrain]], but they also found a previously undescribed pattern of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] activity on the posterior [[medial (anatomy)|medial]] surface of each brain hemisphere, a region involved in the [[Default network|default mode of brain function]], and implicated in self-related processes. Compassion for social pain in others was associated with strong activation in the interoceptive, inferior/posterior portion of this region, while compassion for physical pain in others involved heightened activity in the exteroceptive, superior/anterior portion. Compassion for social pain activated this superior/anterior section, to a lesser extent. Activity in the anterior insula related to compassion for social pain peaked later and endured longer than that associated with compassion for physical pain.&lt;ref name=MHIY2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=Immordino-Yang MH, McColl A, Damasio H, Damasio A |title=Neural correlates of admiration and compassion |journal=Proc.

In one study conducted by Jill Rilling and Gregory Berns, neuroscientists at Emory University, subjects’ brain activity was recorded while they helped someone in need. It was found that while the subjects were performing compassionate acts the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate regions of the brain were activated, the same areas of the brain associated with pleasure and reward. This research sheds light on how acting on compassion induces a positive feeling in people and how humans are innately wired to want to help the suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Keltner, Dacher.

=== Medicine ===
Compassion is one of the most important attributes for physicians practicing medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Medical Ethics|year=1981|publisher=American Medical Association|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that felt compassion brings about the desire to do something to help the sufferer.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; That desire to be helpful is not compassion, but it does suggest that compassion is similar to other emotions by motivating behaviors to reduce the tension brought on by the emotion.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Physicians generally identify their central duties as the responsibility to put the patient's interests first, including the duty not to harm, deliver proper care, and maintain confidentiality.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Compassion is seen in each of those duties because of its direct relation to the recognition and treatment of suffering.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Physicians who use compassion understand the effects of sickness and suffering on human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassell|first=Eric|title=The Nature of Suffering|year=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassion may be closely related to love and the emotions evoked in both. This is illustrated by the relationship between patients and physicians in medical institutions.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; The relationship between suffering patients and their care-givers provides evidence that compassion is a social emotion, which is highly related to closeness between individuals.

=== Compassion fatigue ===
{{Further|Compassion fatigue}}
According to Figley, individuals with a higher capacity or responsibility to empathize with others may be at risk for "compassion fatigue" or stress, which is related to professionals and individuals who spend a significant amount of time responding to information related to suffering.&lt;ref name="Compassion Fatigue: Figley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Figley |first=Charles|title=Compassion Fatigue: Coping With Secondary Traumatic Stress Disorder In Those Who Treat The Traumatized|year=1995|publisher=Brunner-Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0876307595}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, newer research by [[Tania Singer|Singer]] and [[Matthieu Ricard|Ricard]] suggests that it is lack of suitable [[distress tolerance]] which gets people fatigued in compassion activities.&lt;ref name="Altruism: Ricard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Matthieu|title=Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World|chapter=IV|chapter-url=http://info-buddhism.com/Empathy-Compassion-Neuroscience-Ricard-Altruism.html|pages=56–64|year=2015|publisher=Brown and Company|isbn=978-0316208246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that practice of nonjudgmental compassion can prevent fatigue and [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matthieuricard.org/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDYvMDQvMTBfMjNfNDNfNjIxX0tsaW1lY2tpX0xlaWJlcmdfUmljYXJkX1Npbmdlcl8yMDEzX1NDQU4ucGRmIl1d/Klimecki_Leiberg_Ricard_Singer_2013_SCAN.pdf Differential pattern of functional brain plasticity after compassion and empathy training], Olga M.

=== Self-compassion ===
{{Further|Self-compassion}}
Self-compassion is a process of self kindness and accepting suffering as a quality of being human. It has positive effects on subjective [[happiness]], [[optimism]], [[wisdom]], [[curiosity]], [[agreeableness]], and [[extroversion]].&lt;ref name="Emotional effects of compassion - NeV"&gt;{{cite journal|last=NeV|first=Kristen|author2=Stephanie Rude |author3=Kristin Kirpatrick |title=An examination of self-compassion in relation  to positive psychological functioning and personality traits|journal=Journal of Research in Psychology|year=2007|volume=41|issue=4|pages=908–916|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2006.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kristin Neff]] and Christopher Germer have identified that there are three levels of activities that thwart self-compassion and they are self-criticism, self-isolation and self-absorption, they equate this to fight, flight and freeze responses.&lt;ref&gt;http://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/germer.neff.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://chrisgermer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Transforming-Trauma.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is identified that people who lack of life skill equanimity that is akin with distress tolerance are prone to such spontaneous responses. Certain activities may increase feelings of and readiness to practice self-compassion; some of these activities include creating a loving-kindness rituals, practicing empathy, practice random acts of warmth and goodwill like [[tonglen]], etc.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

For increasing compassion in the workplace to self and others ''authentic leadership'' centered on humanism and nourishing quality interconnectedness are considered as the key.&lt;ref name="Compassion in the workplace"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peus|first=Claudia|title=Money over man versus caring and compassion?

Jordan|Judith Jordan]]'s concept of ''self-empathy'' is similar to self-compassion, it implies the capacity to notice, care and respond towards the ones own felt needs. The strategies of self care involve valuing oneself, thinking about one's ideations of needs compassionately, and connecting with others in order to conversely experience renewal, support and validation. Research indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater [[psychological health]] than those who lack self-compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Mark R.; Tate, Eleanor B.; Adams, Claire E.; Batts Allen, Ashley; Hancock, Jessica.

== Historical and spiritual-religious views ==
The ancient Greek and Roman philosophers typically distrusted (feeling) compassion. In the view of many, reason alone was the proper guide to conduct. To some, compassion was an effect, neither admirable nor contemptible. Compassion historically is considered as a passion; [[Justitia]] is blindfolded because her virtue is dispassion and not compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas Szasz]]|title=Cruel Compassion: Psychiatric Control of Society's Unwanted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pduB22E43oC&amp;pg=PA4|year=1998|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-0510-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman society, in fact, compassion was often seen as a vice when it was inclined toward pity, as opposed to mercy. In other words, showing empathy toward someone who was seen as deserving was considered virtuous, whereas showing empathy to someone deemed unworthy was considered immoral (weak).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gladiators: Violence and Spectacle in Ancient Rome | author=Dunkle, Roger | publisher=Routledge | year=2008 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdvbAAAAQBAJ | page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtue of compassion to all living beings, claim [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;M.K. Gandhi, Hindu Dharma, {{ISBN|978-8122201086}}, Orient Paperbacks&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tripathi, A., &amp; Mullet, E. (2010), Conceptualizations of forgiveness and forgivingness among Hindus, The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 20(4), pp 255-266&lt;/ref&gt; is a central concept in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name=nmgc/&gt;

''Daya'' is defined by [[Padma Purana]] as the virtuous desire to mitigate the sorrow and difficulties of others by putting forth whatever effort necessary.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Parmeshwaranand, Encyclopaedic Dictionary of The Dharmasastra, {{ISBN|978-8176253659}}, pp 369-370&lt;/ref&gt; Matsya Purana describes ''daya'' as the value that treats all living beings (including human beings) as one's own self, wanting the welfare and good of the other living being.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matsya Purana, 52.8 and 143.31 through 332&lt;/ref&gt; Such compassion, claims [[Matsya Purana]], is one of necessary paths to being happy. Ekadashi Tattvam&lt;ref&gt;Ekadashi Tattvam, [[Raghunandana Bhattacharya]], Smriti, Calcutta/London (1816)&lt;/ref&gt; explains ''daya'' is treating a stranger, a relative, a friend and a foe as one's own self; it argues that compassion is that state when one sees all living beings as part of one's own self, and when everyone's suffering is seen as one's own suffering. Compassion to all living beings, including to those who are strangers and those who are foes, is seen as a noble virtue.&lt;ref name=abde&gt;Anandita Balslev and Dirk Evers (Editors), Compassion in the World's Religions: Envisioning Human Solidarity (Religionswissenschaft: Forschung und Wissenschaft), {{ISBN|978-3643104762}}, LIT Verlag (2009), see Chapter 4, Compassion: Etymology, Rituals, Anecdotes from the Hindu Tradition&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karuna'', another word for compassion in Hindu philosophy, means placing one's mind in other's favor, thereby seeking to understand the other from their perspective.

Compassion in Hinduism is discussed as an absolute and relative concept. There are two forms of compassion: one for those who suffer even though they have done nothing wrong and one for those who suffer because they did something wrong. Absolute compassion applies to both, while relative compassion addresses the difference between the former and the latter. An example of the latter include those who plead guilty or are convicted of a crime such as murder; in these cases, the virtue of compassion must be balanced with the virtue of justice.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muniapan | first1 = B | year = 2008 | title = Kautilya's Arthashastra and Perspectives on Organizational Management | url = | journal = Asian Social Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 30–34 | doi=10.5539/ass.v4n1p30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' written between 200 BC and AD 400, and sometimes called the Tamil [[Veda]], is a cherished classic on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It dedicates Chapter 25 of Book 1 to compassion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=December 16, 2014 }} verses 241-250&lt;/ref&gt; further dedicating separate chapters each for the resulting values of compassion, chiefly, [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] (Chapter 26), [[non-violence|doing no harm]] (Chapter 32), [[non-killing]] (Chapter 33), possession of [[kindness]] (Chapter 8), dreading evil deeds (Chapter 21), [[benignity]] (Chapter 58), the right [[scepter]] (Chapter 55), and absence of [[terrorism]] (Chapter 57), to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H.

===Jainism===
{{further|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
Compassion for all life, human and non-human, is central to the [[Jainism|Jain]] tradition. Though all life is considered sacred, human life is deemed the highest form of earthly existence. To kill any person, no matter their crime, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is the only substantial religious tradition that requires both monks and laity to be vegetarian. It is suggested that certain strains of the [[Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] became vegetarian due to strong Jain influences.&lt;ref&gt;South India Handbook: The Travel Guide By Robert Bradnock, 2000 Footprint Travel Guides, p. 543, Vegetarianism: A History By Colin Spencer, 2002 Thunder's Mouth Press, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain tradition's stance on [[ahimsa|nonviolence]], however, goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice [[veganism]].  Jains run animal shelters all over India. The [[Lal Mandir]], a prominent Jain temple in Delhi, is known for the Jain Birds Hospital in a second building behind the main temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Powell Ettinger |url=http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/world/bird-hospital.html#cr |title=Jainism and the legendary Delhi bird hospital |publisher=Wildlifeextra.com |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ja7iTij7Bc0C&amp;pg=PT81&amp;dq=birds+hospital+in+delhi#v=onepage&amp;q=birds%20hospital%20in%20delhi&amp;f=false |title=Top 10 Delhi - Dorling Kindersley - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-09-28|isbn=9780756695637 |date=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
In the [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]], [[God]] is the Compassionate and is invoked as the Father of Compassion:&lt;ref&gt;Lampert K., ''Traditions of Compassion: From Religious Duty to Social Activism'', Palgrave-Macmillan, 2006; {{ISBN|978-1-4039-8527-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence ''Raḥmana'' or Compassionate becomes the usual designation for His revealed word. (Compare, below, the frequent use of ''raḥman'' in the [[Quran]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=699&amp;letter=C&amp;search=compassion |title=The Jewish Encyclopedia |publisher=The Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorrow and pity for one in distress, creating a desire to relieve it, is a feeling ascribed alike to man and God: in [[Biblical Hebrew]], ("riḥam," from "reḥem," the mother, womb), "to pity" or "to show mercy" in view of the sufferer's helplessness, hence also "to forgive" (Hab. iii. 2), "to forbear" (Ex. ii. 6; I Sam. xv. 3; Jer. xv. 15, xxi. 7). The [[Rabbi]]s speak of the "thirteen attributes of compassion." The [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] conception of compassion is the feeling of the parent for the child. Hence the prophet's appeal in confirmation of his trust in God invokes the feeling of a mother for her offspring (Isa. xlix. 15).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule (see above) came from the first century [[Hillel the Elder|Rabbi Hillel the Elder]]. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] and, as such, one of the most important figures in [[Jewish history]]. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the "while standing on one leg" meaning in the most concise terms, Hillel stated: "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is the explanation; go and learn."&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], tractate Shabbat 31a. See also the [[ethic of reciprocity]] or "The [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Post [[9/11]], the words of Rabbi Hillel are frequently quoted in public lectures and interviews around the world by the prominent writer on comparative religion [[Karen Armstrong]].

Many Jewish sources speak of the importance of compassion for animals. Significant rabbis who have done so include Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishveg.com/schwartz/rabbinic.htm |title=Judaism and Vegetarianism: RABBINIC TEACHINGS ON VEGETARIANISM |publisher=Jewishveg.com |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Simhah Zissel Ziv,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/413321/Jewish_Virtue_Ethics_and_Compassion_for_Animals_A_Model_from_the_Musar_Movement|title=Jewish Virtue Ethics and Compassion for Animals: A Model from the Musar Movement|last=Claussen|first=Geoffrey|date=2011|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-09-28|journal=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi Moshe Cordovero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishveg.com/DScordovero.html |title=Rav Moshe Cordoero on Compassion for Animals |publisher=JewishVeg |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Karuṇā}}
[[File:Liao Dynasty Avalokitesvara Statue Clear.jpeg|thumb|[[Avalokiteśvara]] looking out over the sea of suffering. [[China]], [[Liao Dynasty]].]]
The first of what in English are called the [[Four Noble Truths]] is the truth of [[suffering]] or [[dukkha]] (unsatisfactoriness or stress). [[Dukkha]] is identified as one of the [[Three marks of existence|three distinguishing characteristics]] of all conditioned existence. It arises as a consequence of the failure to adapt to change  or [[anicca]] (the second characteristic) and the insubstantiality, lack of fixed identity, the horrendous lack of certainty of [[anatta]] (the third characteristic) to which all this constant change in turn gives rise. Compassion made possible by observation and accurate perception is the appropriate practical response. The ultimate and earnest wish, manifest in the Buddha, both as archetype and as historical entity, is to relieve the suffering of all living beings everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;HarperCollins  Dictionary of Religion, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]] has said, "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter - Dalai Lama|url=https://twitter.com/dalailama/status/576314276228390912|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Buddhist monk|monk]] [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states that compassion "supplies the complement to [[metta|loving-kindness]]: whereas loving-kindness has the characteristic of wishing for the [[happiness]] and welfare of others, compassion has the characteristic of wishing that others be free from suffering, a wish to be extended without limits to all living beings. Like [[metta]], compassion arises by entering into the [[subjectivity]] of others, by sharing their interiority in a deep and total way. It springs up by considering that all beings, like ourselves, wish to be free from suffering, yet despite their wishes continue to be harassed by [[Pain and nociception|pain]], [[fear]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], and other forms of dukkha."&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''The Noble Eightfold Path: Way to the End of Suffering''. Buddhist Publication Society, 1994, page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:G. Conti La parabola del Buon Samaritano Messina Chiesa della Medaglia Miracolosa Casa di Ospitalità Collereale.jpg|thumb|Compassion in action: an 18th-century Italian depiction of the Parable of the [[Good Samaritan]]]]

The Christian [[Bible]]'s [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]] is but one place where God is spoken of as the "Father of compassion" and the "God of all comfort." It reads as follows: 2 Corinthians 1:3-7 "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves received from God. For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows. If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort." [[Jesus]] embodies for [[Christian]]s, the very essence of compassion and relational care. Christ challenges Christians to forsake their own desires and to act compassionately towards others, particularly those in need or distress.&lt;ref&gt;Lampert Khen (2006), Ch. 1 ''incomplete reference''&lt;/ref&gt; Most significantly, he demonstrated compassion to those his society had condemned - tax collectors, prostitutes and criminals.

Conversely, a 2012 study of the [[historical Jesus]] has claimed that the founder of Christianity sought to elevate Judaic compassion as the supreme human virtue, capable of reducing suffering and fulfilling our God-ordained purpose of transforming the world into something more worthy of its creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|year=2012|publisher=Denis Jones and associates|location=Sydney|isbn=9780646530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
[[File:Nomad prayer.jpg|thumb|A 1930s photograph of a [[desert]] traveler seeking the assistance of [[Allah]] the Merciful, the Compassionate]]

In the Muslim tradition, foremost among [[Allah|God's]] [[99 Names of Allah#List of Names|attributes]] are mercy and compassion or, in the canonical language of Arabic, ''Rahman'' and ''Rahim''. Each of the 114 chapters of the [[Quran]], with one exception, begins with the verse, "In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/tawheed/conceptofgod.html |title=University of Southern California |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Certainly a Messenger has come to you from among yourselves; grievous to him is your falling into distress, excessively solicitous respecting you; to the believers (he is) compassionate.|[[Qur'an]]|{{quran-usc|9|128}}||}}

The Arabic word for compassion is ''rahmah''. As a cultural influence, its roots abound in the Quran. A good Muslim is to commence each day, each prayer and each significant action by invoking Allah the Merciful and Compassionate, i.e., by reciting ''Bism-i-llah a-Rahman-i-Rahim''. The [http://vimeo.com/11262742 womb and family ties] are characterized by compassion and named after the exalted attribute of Allah "Al-Rahim" (The Compassionate).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2672">In the [[philosophy of perception]], '''critical realism''' is the theory that some of our [[sense-data]] (for example, those of [[primary qualities]]) can and do accurately represent external objects, properties, and events, while other of our sense-data (for example, those of [[secondary qualities]] and perceptual illusions) do not accurately represent any external objects, properties, and events. Put simply, critical realism highlights a mind-dependent aspect of the world that reaches to understand (and comes to an understanding of) the mind-independent world.

==Locke==
According to [[John Locke|Locke]], some [[sense-data]], namely the [[sense-data]] of secondary qualities, do not represent anything in the external world, even if they are caused by external qualities (primary qualities). Thus it is natural to adopt a theory of critical realism.

By its talk of sense-data and representation, this theory depends on or presupposes the truth of [[Direct and indirect realism|representationalism]]. If critical realism is correct, then [[Direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] would have to be a correct theory of perception.{{Citation needed|reason=either a source or an expanded logics is needed|date=May 2010}}

==American critical realism==
The American critical realist movement was a response both to [[direct realism]], as well as to [[idealism]] and [[pragmatism]].  In very broad terms, American critical realism was a form of [[representative realism]], in which there are objects that stand as mediators between independent real objects and perceivers. Prominent developers of American critical realism are [[Roy Wood Sellars]] and his son [[Wilfrid Sellars]].&lt;ref&gt;Willem deVries, 2014. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars Wilfrid Sellars]," ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Aug. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

One innovation was that these mediators are not ideas ([[British empiricism]]), but properties, essences, or "character complexes".

==British critical realism==
Similar developments occurred in the UK.  Major figures included [[Samuel Alexander]], [[John Cook Wilson]],  [[H. A. Prichard]], [[H. H. Price]], and [[C. D. Broad]].

==German critical realism==
[[Nicolai Hartmann]] renewed the interest in the critical realist theory in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Schnädelbach, ''Philosophy in Germany 1831-1933'', Cambridge UP, 1984, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}

'''Determinism''' is the philosophical idea that all events, including moral choices, are determined completely by previously existing causes. Determinism is at times understood to preclude free will because it entails that humans cannot act otherwise than they do. It can also be called as [[hard determinism]] from this point of view. [[Hard determinism]] is a position on the relationship of determinism to free will. The theory holds that the universe is utterly rational because complete knowledge of any given situation assures that unerring knowledge of its future is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/determinism Determinism] Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers suggest variants around this basic definition.&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;A list of a dozen varieties of determinism is provided in {{cite book |title=Free Will: The Scandal in Philosophy |author=Bob Doyle |pages=145–146 ''ff'' |isbn=0983580200 |year=2011 |publisher=I-Phi Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeA_gFfHMgoC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. The opposite of determinism is some kind of [[indeterminism]] (otherwise called nondeterminism). Determinism is often contrasted with [[free will]].&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;For example, see {{cite book |title=Freewill and determinism: a study of rival conceptions of man |author=Richard Langdon Franklin |year=1968 |publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51wIAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism often is taken to mean ''causal determinism'', which in physics is known as cause-and-effect. It is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|event]]s within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below.

Other debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or [[multiverse]]). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as [[compatibilistic]] (allowing the two to coexist) and [[incompatibilistic]] (denying their coexistence is a possibility). Determinism should not be confused with [[Self-determination_theory|self-determination]] of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism rarely requires that perfect [[prediction]] be practically possible.

==Varieties==
"Determinism" may commonly refer to any of the following viewpoints:

[[File:Bled (9664110474).jpg|thumb|right|140px|Many philosophical theories of determinism frame themselves with the idea that reality follows a sort of predetermined path.]]
* Causal determinism is "the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature".&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hoefer |first=Carl | title=Causal Determinism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2009 edition) |date=Apr 1, 2008 |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2009/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, causal determinism is a broad enough term to consider that "one's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in the causal chain that brings something about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves determined like everything else, it is still the case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence or existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way".&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 |date=Nov 18, 2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/moral-responsibility/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing in the universe that is uncaused or [[causa sui|self-caused]]. [[Historical determinism]] (a sort of [[path dependence]]) can also be synonymous with causal determinism. Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions.&lt;ref name=StanfordIncompatibilism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ Arguments for Incompatibilism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding events&amp;mdash;a combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"/&gt; Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"/&gt;
** {{anchor|Nomological determinism}} Nomological determinism is the most common form of causal determinism. It is the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]].&lt;ref name=laplace&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that is a misnomer. Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological determinism (its opposite being [[Indeterminism|physical indeterminism]]).
** [[Necessitarianism]] is closely related to the causal determinism described above. It is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that denies all mere possibility; there is exactly one way for the world to be.

A weaker version holds that, though not predestined to happen, everything that happens has been eternally known by virtue of the divine foreknowledge of an omniscient divinity. If this divinity is also omnipotent, as in the case of the Judeo-Christian religions, this weaker version is hard to distinguish from the previous one because, though able to prevent what happens and knowing that it is going to happen, God lets it happen. To this, advocates of free will reply that God permits it to happen in order to make room for the free will of humans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;mdash;"because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed".&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism|quote=Theological determinism constitutes a fifth kind of determinism.

Either way, the consequence is that everything that happens becomes God's action, and determinism is closely linked to divine action and God's omnipotence. According to the second type of theological determinism, God has perfect knowledge of everything in the universe because God is omniscient. And, as some say, because God is outside of time, God has the capacity of knowing past, present, and future in one instance. This means that God knows what will happen in the future. And because God's omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (i.e. they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J.

We might think of God here as the all-powerful movie director who writes script and causes everything to go accord with it. We should note, as an aside, that there is some debate over what would be sufficient for theological determinism to be true. Some people claim that God's merely knowing what will happen determines that it will, while others believe that God must not only know but must also cause those events to occur in order for their occurrence to be determined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions", more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

* Logical determinism or ''Determinateness'' is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either [[Law of excluded middle|true or false]]. Note that one can support causal determinism without necessarily supporting logical determinism and vice versa (depending on one's views on the nature of [[time]], but also [[randomness]]). The problem of free will is especially salient now with logical determinism: how can choices be free, given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (i.e. it is already determined as either true or false)? This is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]]. [[File:Iimatyas.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Adequate determinism focuses on [[quantum mechanics|the fact that]], even without a full understanding of microscopic physics, we can predict the distribution of 1000 coin tosses.]]
** Often synonymous with logical determinism are the ideas behind spatio-temporal determinism or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]: the view of special relativity. [[J. J. C. Smart]], a proponent of this view, uses the term "tenselessness" to describe the simultaneous existence of past, present, and future. In physics, the "block universe" of [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Albert Einstein]] assumes that time is a fourth dimension (like the three spatial dimensions). In other words, all the other parts of time are real, like the city blocks up and down a street, although the order in which they appear depends on the driver (see [[Rietdijk–Putnam argument]]).
* Adequate determinism is the idea that [[quantum indeterminacy]] can be ignored for most macroscopic events. This is because of [[quantum decoherence]]. Random quantum events "average out" in the [[Expected value|limit of large numbers]] of particles (where the laws of quantum mechanics asymptotically approach the laws of classical mechanics).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/adequate_determinism.html The Information Philosopher website], "Adequate Determinism", from the site: "''We are happy to agree with scientists and philosophers who feel that quantum effects are for the most part negligible in the macroscopic world. We particularly agree that they are negligible when considering the causally determined will and the causally determined actions set in motion by decisions of that will.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] explains a similar idea: he says that the microscopic world of [[quantum mechanics]] is one of determined probabilities. That is, quantum effects rarely alter the predictions of [[classical mechanics]], which are quite accurate (albeit still [[Uncertainty principle|not perfectly certain]]) at larger scales.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: "the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets.", and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (emphasis in original, discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; Something as large as an [[cell (biology)|animal cell]], then, would be "adequately determined" (even in light of quantum indeterminacy).
* The [[many-worlds interpretation]] accepts the linear causal sets of sequential events with adequate consistency yet also suggests constant forking of causal chains creating "multiple universes" to account for multiple outcomes from single events.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Adrian. "One world versus many: the inadequacy of Everettian accounts of evolution, probability, and scientific confirmation." Many worlds (2010): 307–354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning the causal set of events leading to the present are all valid yet appear as a singular linear time stream within a much broader unseen conic probability field of other outcomes that "split off" from the locally observed timeline.  Under this model causal sets are still "consistent" yet not exclusive to singular iterated outcomes.  The interpretation side steps the exclusive retrospective causal chain problem of "could not have done otherwise" by suggesting "the other outcome does exist" in a set of parallel universe time streams that split off when the action occurred.  This theory is sometimes described with the example of agent based choices but more involved models argue that recursive causal splitting occurs with all particle wave functions at play.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidman, Lev. "Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics." (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  This model is highly contested with multiple objections from the scientific community.

==Philosophical connections==

===With nature/nurture controversy===
[[File:JuliusOttoGrimm-Sculpture.jpg|thumb|140px|Nature and nurture interact in humans. A scientist looking at a sculpture after some time does not ask whether we are seeing the effects of the starting materials or of environmental influences.]]
Although some of the above forms of determinism concern human behaviors and [[cognition]], others frame themselves as an answer to the debate on [[nature and nurture]]. They will suggest that one factor will entirely determine behavior. As scientific understanding has grown, however, the strongest versions of these theories have been widely rejected as a [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]].&lt;ref name="melo-martin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Melo-Martín I|title=Firing up the nature/nurture controversy: bioethics and genetic determinism |journal=J Med Ethics|volume=31 |issue=9|pages=526–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16131554 |pmc=1734214|doi=10.1136/jme.2004.008417|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the modern deterministic theories attempt to explain how the interaction of both nature ''and'' nurture is entirely predictable. The concept of [[heritability]] has been helpful in making this distinction.

[[Biological determinism]], sometimes called [[genetic determinism]], is the idea that each of human behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by human genetic nature.

[[Behaviorism]] involves the idea that all behavior can be traced to specific causes—either environmental or reflexive. [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]] developed this nurture-focused determinism.

[[Cultural determinism]] or [[social determinism]] is the nurture-focused theory that the culture in which we are raised determines who we are.

[[Environmental determinism]], also known as climatic or geographical determinism, proposes that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture. Supporters of environmental determinism often{{quantify|date=August 2014}} also support [[Behaviorism|Behavioral determinism]]. Key proponents of this notion have included [[Ellen Churchill Semple]], [[Ellsworth Huntington]], [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] and possibly [[Jared Diamond]], although his status as an environmental determinist is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===With particular factors===
[[File:Using Mobile Phone 0251.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A technological determinist might suggest that technology like the mobile phone is the greatest factor shaping human civilization.]]
Other 'deterministic' theories actually seek only to highlight the importance of a particular factor in predicting the future. These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future. They need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor would allow us to make perfect predictions.

[[Psychological determinism]] can mean that humans must act according to reason, but it can also be synonymous with some sort of [[Psychological egoism]]. The latter is the view that humans will always act according to their perceived best interest.

[[Linguistic determinism]] claims that our language determines (at least limits) the things we can think and say and thus know. The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] argues that individuals experience the world based on the grammatical structures they habitually use.

[[Economic determinism]] attributes primacy to economic structure over politics in the development of human history. It is associated with the [[dialectical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]].

[[Technological determinism]] is a reductionist theory that presumes that a society's technology drives the development of its social structure and cultural values.

===With free will===
{{Main article|Free will}}
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|right|300px|A table showing the different positions related to free will and determinism]]
Philosophers have debated both the truth of determinism, and the truth of free will. This creates the four possible positions in the figure. [[Compatibilism]] refers to the view that [[free will]] is, in some sense, compatible with determinism. The three [[incompatibilist]] positions, on the other hand, deny this possibility. The [[hard incompatibilism|hard incompatibilists]] hold that both determinism and free will do not exist, the [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianists]] that determinism does not hold, and free will might exist, and the [[hard determinism|hard determinists]] that determinism does hold and free will does not exist.

The standard argument against free will, according to philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] focuses on the implications of determinism for 'free will'.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. C. Smart, "Free-Will, Praise and Blame,"''Mind'', July 1961, p.293-4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is true, all our actions are predicted and we are assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.

In his book, ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', author and neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] also argues against free will. He offers one thought experiment where a mad scientist represents determinism. In Harris' example, the mad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, of a particular human. Harris believes that it is no longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has "free will". Harris says nothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will. Harris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious machinations of our brain, rather than those of a mad scientist). Based on this introspection, he writes "This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how can we say that we see any evidence for it in the first place?"&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.216, note102&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "Whether they are predictable or not, we do not cause our causes."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.217, note109&lt;/ref&gt; That is, he believes there is compelling [[evidence of absence]] of free will.

===With the soul===
Some determinists argue that [[materialism]] does not present a complete understanding of the universe, because while it can describe determinate interactions among material things, it ignores the [[mind]]s or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of conscious beings.

A number of positions can be delineated:

# Immaterial souls are all that exist ([[Idealism]]).
# Immaterial souls exist and exert a non-deterministic causal influence on bodies. (Traditional free-will, [[interactionist dualism]]).&lt;ref&gt;By 'soul' in the context of (1) is meant an [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] immaterial agent that has the power to control the body but not to be controlled by the body (this theory of determinism thus conceives of conscious agents in [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] terms). Therefore the soul stands to the activities of the individual agent's body as does the creator of the universe to the universe. The creator of the universe put in motion a deterministic system of material entities that would, if left to themselves, carry out the chain of events determined by ordinary causation. But the creator also provided for souls that could exert a causal force analogous to the primordial causal force and alter outcomes in the physical universe via the acts of their bodies. Thus, it emerges that no events in the physical universe are uncaused. Some are caused entirely by the original creative act and the way it plays itself out through time, and some are caused by the acts of created souls. But those created souls were not created by means of physical processes involving ordinary causation. They are another order of being entirely, gifted with the power to modify the original creation. However, determinism is not necessarily limited to matter; it can encompass energy as well. The question of how these immaterial entities can act upon material entities is deeply involved in what is generally known as the [[mind-body problem]]. It is a significant problem which philosophers have not reached agreement about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/ Free Will (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Immaterial souls exist, but are part of deterministic framework.
# Immaterial souls exist, but exert no causal influence, free or determined ([[epiphenomenalism]], [[occasionalism]])
# Immaterial souls do not exist — there is no [[mind-body problem|mind-body]] [[dichotomy]], and there is a [[Materialism|Materialistic]] explanation for intuitions to the contrary.

===With ethics and morality===
Another topic of debate is the implication that Determinism has on [[Ethics|morality]]. [[Hard determinism]] (a belief in determinism, and not free will) is particularly criticized for seeming to make traditional moral judgments impossible. Some philosophers, however, find this an acceptable conclusion.

Philosopher and incompatibilist [[Peter van Inwagen]] introduces this thesis as such:

Argument that [[Free Will]] is Required for Moral Judgments
# The moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X implies that you should have done something else instead
# That you should have done something else instead implies that there was something else for you to do
# That there was something else for you to do implies that you could have done something else
# That you could have done something else implies that you have free will
# If you don't have free will to have done other than X we cannot make the moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Inwagen|first=Peter|title=The Powers of Rational Beings: Freedom of the Will|year=2009|publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a compatibilist might have an issue with Inwagen's process because one can not change the past like his arguments center around. A compatibilist who centers around plans for the future might posit:
# The moral judgment that you should not have done X implies that you can do something else instead
# That you can do something else instead implies that there is something else for you to do
# That there is something else for you to do implies that you can do something else
# That you can do something else implies that you have free will for planning future recourse
# If you have free will to do other than X we can make the moral judgment that you should do other than X, and punishing you as a responsible party for having done X that you know you should not have done can help you remember to not do X in the future.

== History ==
Determinism has been established by the Greek philosophers, during the 7th and 6th centuries BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus, Leucippus and mainly by the Stoics with the universal causal determinism and Aristotle. Some of the main philosophers who have dealt with this issue are [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Baron d'Holbach]] (Paul Heinrich Dietrich), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[William James]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and, more recently, [[John Searle]], [[Sam Harris]], [[Ted Honderich]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].

Mecca Chiesa notes that the [[probabilistic]] or selectionistic determinism of [[B.F. Skinner]] comprised a wholly separate conception of determinism that was not [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] at all. Mechanistic determinism assumes that every event has an unbroken chain of prior occurrences, but a selectionistic or probabilistic model does not.&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, Mecca (2004) ''Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy &amp; The Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ringen | first1 = J.

In the West, some elements of determinism have been expressed in Greece from the 6th century BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 5 ([[Heraclitus]])&lt;/ref&gt;  and Leucippus.&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 4 ([[Leucippus]])&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-fledged notion of determinism appears to originate with the [[Stoics]], as part of their theory of universal causal determinism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]] ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy'' (Oxford 1998) chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting philosophical debates, which involved the confluence of elements of Aristotelian Ethics with Stoic psychology, led in the 1st-3rd centuries CE in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] to the first recorded Western debate over determinism and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bobzien ''The Inadvertent Conception and Late Birth of the Free-Will Problem'' (Phronesis 43, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; an issue that is known in theology as the [[Argument from free will|paradox of free will]]. The writings of [[Epictetus]] as well as [[Middle Platonist]] and early Christian thought were instrumental in this development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frede]] ''A Free Will: Origins of the Notion in Ancient Thought'' (Berkeley 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] said of the deterministic implications of an omniscient god:&lt;ref&gt;Though Moses Maimonides was not arguing against the existence of God, but rather for the incompatibility between the full '''exercise''' by God of his [[omniscience]] and genuine human [[free will]], his argument is considered by some as affected by Modal Fallacy. See, in particular, the article by Prof. Norman Swartz for ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm Foreknowledge and Free Will] and specifically [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm#section6 Section 6: The Modal Fallacy]&lt;/ref&gt; "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that [that] man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism in the West is often associated with [[Newtonian physics]], which depicts the physical matter of the universe as operating according to a set of fixed, knowable laws. The "billiard ball" hypothesis, a product of Newtonian physics, argues that once the initial conditions of the universe have been established, the rest of the history of the universe follows inevitably. If it were actually possible to have complete knowledge of physical matter and all of the laws governing that matter at any one time, then it would be theoretically possible to compute the time and place of every event that will ever occur (''[[Laplace's demon]]''). In this sense, the basic particles of the universe operate in the same fashion as the rolling balls on a billiard table, moving and striking each other in predictable ways to produce predictable results.

Whether or not it is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian mechanics deals only with caused events, e.g.: If an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed straight toward another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been so enormously successful that it has no competition. But it fails spectacularly as velocities become some substantial fraction of the [[speed of light]] and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied. Before the discovery of [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, "uncertainty" was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.

[[Newtonian mechanics]] as well as any following physical theories are results of observations and experiments, and so they describe "how it all works" within a tolerance. However, old western scientists believed if there are any logical connections found between an observed cause and effect, there must be also some absolute natural laws behind. Belief in perfect natural laws driving everything, instead of just describing what we should expect, led to searching for a set of universal simple laws that rule the world. This movement significantly encouraged deterministic views in western philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Norman (2003) The Concept of Physical Law / Chapter 10: Free Will and Determinism ( https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the related theological views of [[Classical Pantheism]].

=== Eastern tradition ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2010}}
The idea that the entire universe is a [[deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic system]] has been articulated in both Eastern and non-Eastern religion, philosophy, and literature.

In ''[[I Ching]]'' and [[Philosophical Taoism]], the ebb and flow of favorable and unfavorable conditions suggests the path of least resistance is effortless (see [[wu wei]]).

In the philosophical schools of India, the concept of precise and continual effect of laws of [[Karma]] on the existence of all sentient beings is analogous to western deterministic concept. Karma is the concept of "action" or "deed" in Indian religions. It is understood as that which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called saṃsāra) originating in ancient India and treated in Hindu, Jain, and Sikh. Karma is considered predetermined and deterministic in the universe, and in combination with the decisions (free will) of living beings, accumulates to determine futuristic situations that the living being encounters.

=== Generative processes ===
{{Main article|Emergence}}
Although it was once thought by scientists that any indeterminism in quantum mechanics occurred at too small a scale to influence biological or neurological systems, there is indication that [[nervous system]]s are influenced by quantum indeterminism due to [[chaos theory]]{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It is unclear what implications this has for the problem of [[free will]] given various possible reactions to the problem in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–247 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many biologists don't grant determinism: Christof Koch argues against it, and in favour of [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian free will]], by making arguments based on generative processes ([[emergence]]).&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koch |first1=Christof |authorlink1=Christof Koch |editor1-first=Nancy|editor1-last=Murphy |editor2-first=George |editor2-last=Ellis |editor3-first=Timothy|editor3-last=O'Connor |title=Downward Causation and the Neurobiology of Free Will |url= |date=September 2009 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=New York, USA|isbn=978-3-642-03204-2 |pages= |chapter=Free Will, Physics, Biology and the Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proponents of emergentist or [[emergence|generative philosophy]], [[cognitive science]]s and [[evolutionary psychology]], argue that a certain form of determinism (not necessarily causal) is true.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.

[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|120px|In [[Conway's Game of Life]], the interaction of just four simple rules creates patterns that seem somehow "alive".]]

As an illustration, the strategy board-games [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] have rigorous rules in which no information (such as cards' face-values) is hidden from either player and no [[randomness|random]] events (such as dice-rolling) happen within the game. Yet, chess and especially Go with its extremely simple deterministic rules, can still have an extremely large number of unpredictable moves. When chess is simplified to 7 or fewer pieces, however, endgame tables are available that dictate which moves to play to achieve a perfect game.  This implies that, given a less complex environment (with the original 32 pieces reduced to 7 or fewer pieces), a perfectly predictable game of chess is possible.  In this scenario, the winning player can announce that a checkmate will happen within a given number of moves, assuming a perfect defense by the losing player, or fewer moves if the defending player chooses sub-optimal moves as the game progresses into its inevitable, predicted conclusion. By this analogy, it is suggested, the experience of free will emerges from the interaction of finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behavioural responses. In theory, if all these events could be accounted for, and there were a known way to evaluate these events, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become predictable.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Nowak"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Axtell"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Epstein"/&gt; Another hands-on example of generative processes is [[John Horton Conway]]'s playable [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ John Conway's Game of Life]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]] is wary of such models, and coined the term "[[ludic fallacy]]".

=== Compatibility with the existence of science ===
Certain [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] argue that while causal determinism in which everything including the brain/mind is subject to the laws of causality is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not. These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the [[brain]] reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to the results would make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses. This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been a meaningless waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper: Conjectures and refutations&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical models ===
Many [[mathematical models]] of physical systems are deterministic. This is true of most models involving [[differential equations]] (notably, those measuring rate of change over time). Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called [[stochastic]]. Because of [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a deterministic interpretation of the model may not be useful due to [[numerical instability]] and a finite amount of [[accuracy and precision|precision]] in measurement. Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werndl | first1 = Charlotte | year = 2009 | title = Are Deterministic Descriptions and Indeterministic Descriptions Observationally Equivalent? | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.06.004 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 232–242 | bibcode = 2009SHPMP..40..232W | arxiv = 1310.1615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werndl, Charlotte (2009).

=== Quantum and Classical Mechanics ===

====Day-to-day physics====
{{further information|Macroscopic quantum phenomena}}
Since the beginning of the 20th century, [[quantum mechanics]]—the physics of the extremely small—has revealed previously concealed aspects of [[Phenomenon|event]]s. Before that, [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]—the physics of everyday life—dominated. Taken in isolation (rather than as an [[approximation]] to quantum mechanics), Newtonian physics depicts a universe in which objects move in perfectly determined ways. At the scale where humans exist and interact with the universe, Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g. calculating the trajectory of a bullet). But whereas in theory, [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute knowledge]] of the forces accelerating a bullet would produce an absolutely accurate prediction of its path, modern quantum mechanics casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism.

Relevant is the fact that [[certainty]] is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's [[problem of induction]]). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This is an example of the [[butterfly effect]], which is one of the subjects of [[chaos theory]]. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to [[predict]] real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to ''predict'' or attain ''certainty'' as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.

====[[Quantum realm]]====
Quantum physics works differently in many ways from Newtonian physics. Physicist [[Aaron D. O'Connell]] explains that understanding our universe, at such small scales as atoms, requires a different logic than day-to-day life does. O'Connell does not deny that it is all interconnected: the scale of human existence ultimately does emerge from the quantum scale. O'Connell argues that we must simply use different models and constructs when dealing with the quantum world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ted.com/2011/06/02/struggling-with-quantum-logic-qa-with-aaron-oconnell/ "Struggling with quantum logic: Q&amp;A with Aaron O'Connell]&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum mechanics is the product of a careful application of the [[scientific method]], [[logic]] and [[empiricism]]. The [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is frequently confused with the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]. The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time &amp;mdash; if we increase the accuracy in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose accuracy in measuring the other. "These uncertainty relations give us that measure of freedom from the limitations of classical concepts which is necessary for a consistent description of atomic processes."&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1930"&gt;{{cite book |first=Werner |last=Heisenberg |authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|year=1949 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie |trans-title=Physical Principles of Quantum Theory |location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel/University of Chicago Press |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzMBh4ZxKJsC&amp;pg=PA4|isbn=9780486601137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|thumb|right|Although it is not possible to predict the trajectory of any one particle, they all obey determined probabilities which do permit some prediction.]]
This is where [[statistical mechanics]] come into play, and where physicists begin to require rather unintuitive mental models: A particle's path simply cannot be exactly specified in its full quantum description. "Path" is a classical, practical attribute in our every day life, but one that quantum particles do not meaningfully possess. The probabilities discovered in quantum mechanics do nevertheless arise from measurement (of the perceived path of the particle). As [[Stephen Hawking]] explains, the result is not traditional determinism, but rather determined probabilities.&lt;ref name=GDesign&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: ''"the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets...so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion"'', and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a quantum particle may indeed trace an exact path, and the probability of finding the particles in that path is one (certain to be true). In fact, as far as prediction goes, the quantum development is at least as predictable as the classical motion, but the key is that it describes [[wave function]]s that cannot be easily expressed in ordinary language. As far as the thesis of determinism is concerned, these probabilities, at least, are quite determined. These findings from quantum mechanics have found many [[Quantum mechanics#Applications|applications]], and allow us to build [[transistors]] and [[lasers]]. Put another way: personal computers, Blu-ray players and the internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities of the quantum world.&lt;ref name="WhatIsItGoodFor?"&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=everyday-quantum-physics Scientific American, "What is Quantum Mechanics Good For?"]&lt;/ref&gt; None of that should be taken to imply that other aspects of [[quantum mechanics]] are not still [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|up for debate]].

On the topic of predictable probabilities, the [[double-slit experiment]]s are a popular example. [[Photon]]s are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way you might expect of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, and the distribution of its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but there is no way to predict where in the resulting [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern any individual [[photon]] will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use [[weak measurement]] to acquire more information without violating the [[Uncertainty principle]]).

Some (including [[Albert Einstein]]) argue that our inability to predict any more than probabilities is simply due to ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] insisted that, "I am convinced God does not play dice" in a private letter to [[Max Born]], 4 December 1926, [http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 Albert Einstein Archives] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819045822/http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 |date=19 August 2010 }} reel 8, item 180&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws we can observe or deduce, there are also hidden factors or "[[Hidden variable theory|hidden variable]]s" that determine ''absolutely'' in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that the course of the universe is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. So, they say, it only appears that things proceed in a merely probabilistically determinative way. In actuality, they proceed in an absolutely deterministic way.

[[John S. Bell]] criticized Einstein's work in his famous [[Bell's Theorem]], which proved that quantum mechanics can make statistical predictions that would be violated if local hidden variables really existed. A number of experiments have tried to verify such predictions, and so far they do not appear to be violated. Improved continue to verify the result, including the 2015 "[[Bell test experiments#Hensen et al..2C Giustina et al..2C Shalm et al. .282015.29: .22loophole-free.22 Bell tests|Loophole Free Test]]" that plugged all known sources of error and the 2017 "[[Bell test experiments#Johannes Handsteiner et al. .282017.29: .22Cosmic Bell Test.22 - Measurement Settings from Milky Way Stars|Cosmic Bell Test]]" that based the experiment cosmic data streaming from different directions toward the Earth, precluding the possibility the sources of data could have had prior interactions. However, it is possible to augment quantum mechanics with non-local hidden variables to achieve a deterministic theory that is in agreement with experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jabs | first=Arthur | year=2016 | title= A conjecture concerning determinism, reduction, and measurement in quantum mechanics | doi= 10.1007/s40509-016-0077-7 | journal= Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations | volume= 3 | issue= 4 | pages=279–292| arxiv=1204.0614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Bohm's Interpretation, though, violates special relativity and it is highly controversial whether or not it can be reconciled without giving up on determinism.

More advanced variations on these arguments include [[Quantum contextuality]], by Bell, [[Simon B. Kochen]] and [[Ernst Specker]] in which argues that hidden variable theories cannot be "sensible," which here means that the values of the hidden variables inherently depend on the devices used to measure them.

This debate is relevant because it is easy to imagine specific situations in which the arrival of an electron at a screen at a certain point and time would trigger one event, whereas its arrival at another point would trigger an entirely different event (e.g. see [[Schrödinger's cat]] - a thought experiment used as part of a deeper debate).

Thus, quantum physics casts reasonable doubt on the traditional determinism of classical, Newtonian physics in so far as reality does not seem to be absolutely determined. This was the subject of the famous [[Bohr–Einstein debates]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] and there is [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics#Comparison|still no consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Robert C. |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Kane |title=The Oxford Handbook of Free Will |edition=Second |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=9780195399691 | oclc=653483691 |page=90 |chapter=Chaos, Indeterminism, and Free Will |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzcFDsWg0GEC&amp;pg=PA90 |quote=The key question is whether to understand the nature of this probability as epistemic or ontic. Along epistemic lines, one possibility is that there is some additional factor (i.e., a hidden mechanism) such that once we discover and understand this factor, we would be able to predict the observed behavior of the quantum stoplight with certainty (physicists call this approach a "hidden variable theory"; see, e.g., Bell 1987, 1–13, 29–39; Bohm 1952a, 1952b; Bohm and Hiley 1993; Bub 1997, 40–114, Holland 1993; see also the preceding essay in this volume by Hodgson). Or perhaps there is an interaction with the broader environment (e.g., neighboring buildings, trees) that we have not taken into account in our observations that explains how these probabilities arise (physicists call this approach decoherence or consistent histories&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;). Under either of these approaches, we would interpret the observed indeterminism in the behavior of stoplights as an expression of our ignorance about the actual workings. Under an ignorance interpretation, indeterminism would not be a fundamental feature of quantum stoplights, but merely epistemic in nature due to our lack of knowledge about the system. Quantum stoplights would turn to be deterministic after all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim E.|title=Beyond Measure: Modern Physics, Philosophy, and the Meaning of Quantum Theory|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=0-19-852536-2|oclc=52486237|page=203|chapter=Complementarity and Entanglement|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVdjwsqrgz8C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=scientific+consensus+determinism+bell+theorem&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4v8PUaL5MarK0QWk8oCwBw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=scientific%20consensus%20determinism%20bell%20theorem&amp;f=false|quote=So, was Einstein wrong? In the sense that the EPR paper argued in favour of an objective reality for each quantum particle in an entangled pair independent of the other and of the measuring device, the answer must be yes. But if we take a wider view and ask instead if Einstein was wrong to hold to the realist's belief that the physics of the universe should be objective and deterministic, we must acknowledge that we cannot answer such a question. It is in the nature of theoretical science that there can be no such thing as certainty. A theory is only 'true' for as long as the majority of the scientific community maintain a consensus view that the theory is the one best able to explain the observations. And the story of quantum theory is not over yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate determinism (see [[Determinism#Varieties|Varieties]], above) is the reason that Stephen Hawking calls [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]] "just an illusion".&lt;ref name="GDesign"/&gt; see [[Free will]] for further discussions on this topic.

====Other matters of quantum determinism====
{{essay|section|date=November 2017}}
{{unsourced section|date=August 2018}}
[[File:HEUraniumC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Chaotic radioactivity is the next explanatory challenge for physicists supporting determinism.]]
All uranium found on earth is thought to have been synthesized during a [[supernova]] explosion that occurred roughly 5 billion years ago. Even before the laws of quantum mechanics were developed to their present level, the [[radioactivity]] of such elements has posed a challenge to determinism due to its unpredictability. One gram of [[uranium-238]], a commonly occurring radioactive substance, contains some 2.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; atoms. Each of these atoms are identical and indistinguishable according to all tests known to modern science. Yet about 12600 times a second, one of the atoms in that gram will decay, giving off an [[alpha particle]]. The challenge for determinism is to explain why and when decay occurs, since it does not seem to depend on external stimulus. Indeed, no extant theory of physics makes [[testable]] predictions of exactly when any given atom will decay. At best scientists can discover determined probabilities in the form of the element's [[half life]].

The time dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] gives the first time [[derivative]] of the [[quantum state]]. That is, it explicitly and uniquely predicts the development of the [[wave function]] with time.
::&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2\psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\psi&lt;/math&gt;
So if the wave function itself is reality (rather than probability of classical coordinates), then the unitary evolution of the wave function in quantum mechanics, can be said to be deterministic. But the unitary evolution of the wave function is not the entirety of quantum mechanics.

Asserting that quantum mechanics is deterministic by treating the wave function itself as reality might be thought to imply a [[Universal wavefunction|single wave function for the entire universe]], starting at the origin of the universe. Such a "wave function of everything" would carry the probabilities of not just the world we know, but every other possible world that could have evolved. For example, large voids in the distributions of [[galaxy|galaxies]] are believed by many cosmologists to have originated in quantum fluctuations during the big bang. (''See'' [[cosmic inflation]], [[primordial fluctuations]] and [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].)

However, neither the posited reality nor the proven and extraordinary accuracy of the wave function and quantum mechanics at small scales can imply or reasonably suggest the existence of a single wave function for the entire universe. Quantum mechanics breaks down wherever gravity becomes significant, because nothing in the wave function, or in quantum mechanics, predicts anything at all about gravity. And this is obviously of great importance on larger scales.

Gravity is thought of as a large-scale force, with a longer reach than any other. But gravity becomes significant even at masses that are tiny compared to the mass of the universe.

A wave function the size of the universe might successfully model a universe with no gravity. Our universe, with gravity, is vastly different from what quantum mechanics alone predicts. To forget this is a colossal error.

[[Objective collapse theory|Objective collapse theories]], which involve a dynamic (and non-deterministic) collapse of the wave function (e.g. [[Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory]], [[Penrose interpretation]], or [[causal fermion system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) avoid these absurdities. The theory of [[causal fermion system]]s for example, is able to unify [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]], via a more fundamental theory that is non-linear, but gives rise to the linear behaviour of the wave function and also gives rise to the non-linear, non-deterministic, wave-function collapse. These theories suggest that a deeper understanding of the theory underlying quantum mechanics shows the universe is indeed non-deterministic at a fundamental level.

{{Asian philosophy sidebar}}
'''Dignāga''' (a.k.a. ''Diṅnāga'', c. 480 – c. 540 CE) was an Indian Buddhist scholar and one of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] founders of [[Indian logic]] (''hetu vidyā''). Dignāga's work laid the groundwork for the development of [[deductive logic]] in India and created the first system of [[Buddhist logic]] and [[epistemology]] ([[Pramana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Zheng Wei-hong; Dignāga and Dharmakīrti: Two Summits of Indian Buddhist Logic. Research Institute of Chinese Classics; Fudan University; Shanghai, China&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Georges B Dreyfus, his philosophical school brought about an Indian "epistemological turn" and became the "standard formulation of Buddhist logic and epistemology in India and Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti’s Philosophy and its Tibetan Interpretations, (Suny: 1997), page 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Dignāga's thought influenced later Buddhist philosophers like [[Dharmakirti]] and also Hindu thinkers of the [[Nyaya]] school. Dignāga's [[epistemology]] accepted only "perception" ([[Pramana#Hinduism|pratyaksa]]) and "inference" ([[anumāṇa]]) are valid instruments of knowledge and introduced the widely influential theory of "exclusion" (''apoha'') to explain linguistic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Dan. The Philosophical Works and Influence of Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393521/obo-9780195393521-0085.xml&lt;/ref&gt; His work on language, inferential reasoning and perception were also widely influential among later Indian philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, John. "Dignaga" in Buswell (ed.) ''ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BUDDHISM. Volume One A-L''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard P. Hayes "some familiarity with Dinnaga's arguments and conclusions is indispensable for anyone who wishes to understand the historical development of [[Indian philosophy|Indian thought]]."&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dignāga was born in Simhavakta near [[Kanchipuram]] and very little is known of his early years, except that he took as his spiritual preceptor Nagadatta of the [[Pudgalavada]] school before being expelled and becoming a student of [[Vasubandhu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemplating Reality: A Practitioner's Guide to the View in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism |first=Andy |last=Karr |publisher=Shambhala Publications |year=2007 |isbn=9781590304297 |page=212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTd_fbuERdEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Philosophy==
[[File:2 Pramana Epistemology Buddhism.svg|thumb|Buddhist epistemology holds that perception and inference are the means to correct knowledge.]]
Dignāga mature philosophy is expounded in his ''magnum opus'', the [[Pramāṇa-samuccaya]]. In chapter one, Dignāga's explains his [[epistemology]] which holds that there are only two 'instruments of knowledge' or 'valid cognitions' (''pramāṇa''); "perception" or "sensation" ([[Pramana#Hinduism|pratyaksa]]) and "inference" or "reasoning" ([[anumāṇa]]). In chapter one, Dignāga writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sensation and reasoning are the only two means of acquiring knowledge, because two attributes are knowable; there is no knowable object other than the peculiar and the general attribute. I shall show that sensation has the peculiar attribute as its subject matter, while reasoning has the general attribute as its subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perception is a non-conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep&gt;Tom Tillemans (2011), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dharmakiirti/ Dharmakirti], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; This conservative epistemic theory was in contrast to the [[Nyaya]] school who accepted other means of knowledge such as ''Upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy).

===Pratyaksa===
Pratyaksa is a kind of awareness that acquires information about particulars, and is immediately present to one of the senses. This is the topic of the first chapter of the ''Pramāṇa-samuccaya.''&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 132.&lt;/ref&gt; For Dignāga, perception is pre-verbal, pre-conceptual and unstructured sense data. In chapter two of the ''Pramāṇa-samuccaya'' he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sensation is devoid of structure. That cognition in which there is no structure is sensation. What kind of thing is this so-called structure? Attaching a name, a universal and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Dignāga our mind always takes raw sense data or particulars and interprets them or groups them together in more complex ways, compares them to past experiences, gives them names to classify them based on general attributes (''samanyalaksana'') and so forth. This process he terms ''kalpana'' (arranging, structuring).&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 135.&lt;/ref&gt; This cognitive process is already different than sensation, which is a simple cognition based only on the immediately present. Thus pratyaksa is only awareness of particular sense data such as a patch of green color and the sensation of hardness, never awareness of a macroscopic object such an apple which is always a higher level synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 138.&lt;/ref&gt; For Dignāga, sensation is also inerrant, it cannot "stray" because it is the most basic and simple phenomenon of experience or as he puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"it is impossible too for the object of awareness itself to be errant, for errancy is only the content of misinterpretation by the mind."&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, for Dignaga, ''pratyaksa'' is mostly phenomenalist and is not dependent on the existence of an external world. It is also inexpressible and private.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
===Anumana===
''Anumana'' (inference or reasoning) for Dignāga is a type of cognition which is only aware of general attributes, and is constructed out of simpler sensations. Inference can also be communicated through linguistic conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 143.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A central issue which concerned Dignāga was the interpretation of signs (''linga'') or the evidence (''hetu'') which led one to an inference (''anumana'') about states of affairs; such as how smoke can lead one to infer that there is a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This topic of ''svārthānumāna'' (reasoning, literally "inference for oneself") is the subject of chapter two of the Pramāṇa-samuccaya while the topic of the third chapter is about demonstration (''parārthānumāna'', literally "inference for others"), that is, how one communicates one's inferences through proper argument.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 132-33.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Richard Hayes, in Dignāga's system, to obtain knowledge that a property (the "inferable property", ''sadhya'') is inherent in a "subject of inference" (''paksa'') it must be derived through an inferential sign (''linga''). For this to occur, the following must be true:&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 146, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; 

#The inferential sign must be a  property of the subject of the inference. That is, there exists in the subject of inference a property, which is different from the inferable property and which is furthermore evident to the person drawing the inference; this second property may serve as an inferential sign in case it has two further characteristics.
#The inferential sign must be known to occur in at least one locus, other than the subject of inference, in which the inferable property occurs.
#The inferential sign must not be known to occur in ''any'' other loci in which the inferable property is absent.

Richard Hayes interprets these criteria as overly strict and this is because he sees Dignāga's system as one of rational [[skepticism]]. Dignāga's epistemology, argues Hayes, is a way to express and practice the traditional Buddhist injunction not become attached to views and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 146, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hayes, for Dignāga, the role of logic is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;to counter dogmatism and prejudice. As a weapon in the battle against prejudice that rages in every mind that seeks wisdom--in minds of the vast majority of people who do not seek wisdom, prejudice simply takes full control without a contest-there is nothing as powerful as the kind of reason that lies at the heart of Dignaga's system of logic. For it should be clear that very few of our judgments in ordinary life pass the standards set by the three characteristics of legitimate' evidence. Taken in its strictest interpretation, none of the judgments of any but a  fully omniscient being passes. And, since there is no evidence that there exist any fully omniscient beings, the best available working hypothesis is that no one's thinking is immune from errors that require revision in the face of newly discovered realities.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Apohavada'' and language===
Dignāga considered the interpretation of conventional and symbolic signs such as the words and sentences of human language to be no more than special or conventional instances of the general principles of inference or anumana.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He takes up several issues relating to language and its relationship to inference in the fifth chapter of his ''Pramāṇa-samuccaya''.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 132.&lt;/ref&gt;   

During Dignāga's time, the orthodox Indian [[Nyaya]] school and also Hindu Sanskrit grammarians (such as [[Bhartṛhari]]) had discussed issues of epistemology and language respectively, but their theories generally accepted the concept of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] which was rejected by most Buddhist philosophers. Influenced by the work of these thinkers as well as by Buddhist philosophers of the [[Sautrantika]] school who rejected Hindu theories of universals in favor of nominalism (''prajñapti''), Dignāga developed his own Buddhist theory of language and meaning based on the concept of "apoha" (exclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Hattori Masaaki explains the doctrine thus: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;a word indicates an object merely through the exclusion of other objects (''anyapoha'', ''-vyavrtti''). For example, the word "cow" simply means that the object is not a non-cow. As such, a word cannot denote anything real, whether it be an individual (vyakti), a universal (jati), or any other thing. The apprehension of an object by means of the exclusion of other objects is nothing but an inference.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 26.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Works==
As noted by Hayes, the difficulty in studying the highly terse works of Dignāga is considerable, because none of them have survived in the original [[Sanskrit]] and the Tibetan and Chinese translations which do survive show signs of having been done by translators who were not completely certain of the meaning of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, (1982), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This difficulty has also led scholars to read Dignaga through the lens of later authors such as [[Dharmakirti]] and their Indian and Tibetan interpreters as well as their Hindu [[Nyaya]] opponents. Because of this tendency in scholarship, ideas which are actually innovations of Dharmakirti and later authors have often been associated with Dignaga by scholars such as [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] and S. Mookerjee, even though these thinkers often differ.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, (1982), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Dignāga's ''magnum opus'', the ''[[Pramāṇa-samuccaya]]'' (''Compendium of Valid Cognition''), examined perception, language and inferential reasoning. It presents perception as a bare cognition, devoid of conceptualization and sees language as useful fictions created through a process of exclusion ([[Buddhist logic#Doctrine of Anyapoha|Apoha]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Dan. The Philosophical Works and Influence of Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393521/obo-9780195393521-0085.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works include:
*''[[Hetucakra]]'' (''The wheel of reason''), considered his first work on formal logic. It may be regarded as a bridge between the older doctrine of ''[[trairūpya]]'' and Dignāga's own later theory of ''[[vyapti]]'' which is a concept related to the Western notion of [[logical consequence|implication]].

*''[[Alambana]]-parīkṣā'', (''The Treatise on the Objects of Cognition'') and its auto commentary (''vrtti'').

*''Abhidharmakośa-marma-pradīpa'' – a condensed summary of [[Vasubandhu]]'s seminal work the [[Abhidharmakosha]]
*A summary of the Mahayana ''[[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|Aṣṭasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā sūtra]]''

*''Trikāla-parikṣa'', (''Treatise on the tri-temporality'')

*''Nyāya-mukha'' (''Introduction to logic'').

==Tradition and Influence==
Dignāga founded a tradition of Buddhist logic, and this school is sometimes called the "School of Dignāga" or the "Dignāga-Dharmakīrti school". In Tibetan it is often called “those who follow reasoning” (Tibetan: ''rigs pa rjes su ‘brang ba''); in modern literature it is sometimes known by the [[Sanskrit]] 'pramāṇavāda', often translated as "the Epistemological School"&lt;ref&gt;Tillemans, Tom, "Dharmakīrti", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dharmakiirti/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; or "The logico-epistemological school."

Buddhist philosophers who wrote on [[pramana]] include:

*[[Dharmakīrti]] (c. 7th century)
*[[Jinendrabuddhi]]
*[[Dharmapala of Nalanda]]
*[[Santabhadra]]
*[[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788)
*[[Dharmottara]] (8th century)
*[[Prajñakaragupta]]
*[[Samkarananda]]
*[[Ratnākaraśānti]] (c.1000)
*[[Jñanasrimitra]] (975–1025)
*[[Ratnakīrti]] (11th century)

This tradition of logic and epistemology continued in [[Tibet]], where it was expanded by thinkers such as Cha-ba (1182–1251) and [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251).

Dignaga also influenced non-Buddhist Sanskrit thinkers. According to Lawrence J. McCrea, and Parimal G. Patil, Dignaga set in motion an "epistemic turn" in Indian philosophy:

{{block quote|In the centuries following Dignāga’s work, virtually all philosophical questions were reconfigured as epistemological ones. That is, when making any claim at all, it came to be seen as incumbent on a philosopher to situate that claim within a fully developed theory of knowledge. The systematic articulation and interrogation of the underlying presuppositions of all knowledge claims thus became the central preoccupation of most Sanskrit philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence J. McCrea, and Parimal G. Patil. Buddhist Philosophy of Language in India: Jnanasrimitra on Exclusion. New York: Columbia University Press, 2010. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''East Mountain Teaching''' ({{CJKV|t=東山法門|p=Dōngshān Fǎmén|l=East Mountain Dharma Gate}}) denotes the teachings of the Fourth Ancestor [[Dayi Daoxin]], his student and heir the Fifth Ancestor [[Daman Hongren]], and their students and lineage of [[Chan Buddhism]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=25, 29}}

''East Mountain Teaching'' gets its name from the East Mountain Temple on the "Twin Peaks" ({{zh|c=雙峰}}) of [[Huangmei County|Huangmei]] (modern Hubei). The East Mountain Temple was on the easternmost peak of the two. Its modern name is Wuzu Temple ({{zh|c=五祖寺}}).

The two most famous disciples of Hongren, [[Huineng]] and [[Yuquan Shenxiu]], both continued the East Mountain teaching.

==History==
The East Mountain School was established by Daoxin ({{lang|zh|道信}} 580–651) at East Mountain Temple on Potou (Broken Head) Mountain, which was later renamed Shuangfeng (Twin Peaks). Daoxin taught there for 30 years. He established the first monastic home for "Bodhidharma's Zen".

The tradition holds that Hongren ({{lang|zh|弘忍}} 601–674) left home at an early age (between seven and fourteen) and lived at East Mountain Temple on Twin Peaks, where Daoxiin was the abbot.
{{quote|Upon Daoxin's death [in 651 C.E]. at the age of seventy-two, Hongren assumed the abbacy. He then moved East Mountain Temple approximately ten kilometers east to the flanks of Mt. Pingmu. Soon, Hongren's fame eclipsed that of his teacher.{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=30}}}}

==Teachings==
The East Mountain community was a specialized meditation training centre. The establishment of a community in one location was a change from the wandering lives of Bodhidharma and Huike and their followers.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=34}} It fitted better into the Chinese society, which highly valued community-oriented behaviour, instead of solitary practice{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=25–26}}

An important aspect of the East Mountain Teachings was its nonreliance on a single sutra or a single set of sutras for its doctrinal foundation as was done by most of the other Buddhist sects of the time.

The East Mountain School incorporated both the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra]]s''.

The view of the mind in the ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]'' also had a significant import on the doctrinal development of the East Mountain Teaching.:&lt;ref&gt;Zeuschner, Robert B. (1978). "The Understanding of Mind in the Northern Line of Ch'an (Zen)." ''Philosophy East and West,'' Volume 28, Number 1 (January 1978). Hawaii, USA: University of Hawaii Press, pp. 69-79&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In the words of the Awakening of Faith&amp;nbsp;— which summarizes the essentials of Mahayana&amp;nbsp;— self and world, mind and suchness, are integrally one. Everything is a carrier of that a priori enlightenment; all incipient enlightenment is predicated on it. The mystery of existence is, then, not, "How may we overcome alienation?" The challenge is, rather, "Why do we think we are lost in the first place?"{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=}}}}
There were three main meditation techniques taught by this school. One was a meditation on [[śūnyatā]] "emptiness" in which one contemplates all dharmas of body and mind as empty. Another practice was the contemplation of some 'ultimate principle', this was associated with the 'one-practice [[samadhi]]' ({{zh|c=一行三昧|p=yīxíng sānmèi}}) and in some texts such as the ''[[Lengqie shizi ji]]'' is achieved by meditating on a single Buddha. The third technique was the practice of concentrating the mind on one thing (''guan yi wu'') until the mind becomes fixed in samadhi. The goal of all of these practices was to suppress the stream of thoughts which clouds the mind and allow the practitioner to gain insight into the pure, radiant consciousness in everyone.{{sfn|Bielefeldt|1986|p=140}}

===Fourth Patriarch Daoxin (四祖道信)===
Daoxin is credited with several important innovations that led directly to the ability of Chan to become a popular religion. Among his most important contributions were:
# The Unification of Chan practice with acceptance of the Buddhist precepts,
# The unification of the teachings of the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' with those of the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutras, which includes the well-known ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' and ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'',
# The incorporation of chanting, including chanting the name of Buddha, into Chan practice.{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=26}}

===Fifth Patriarch Hongren (五祖弘忍)===
Hongren was a plain meditation teacher, who taught students of "various religious interests", including "practitioners of the [[Lotus Sutra]], students of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy, or specialists in the monastic regulations of Buddhist [[Vinaya]]".{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=34}}

Following Daoxin, Hongren included an emphasis on the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutras, including the ''Heart Sutra'' and the ''Diamond Sutra'', along with the emphasis on the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra''.

Though Hongren was known for not compiling writings and for teaching Zen principles orally, the classical Chan text ''Discourse on the Highest Vehicle'', is attributed to him.{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=29, 31}} This work emphasizes the practice of "maintaining the original true mind" that "naturally cuts off the arising of delusion."{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=29}}

==Split in Northern and Southern School==
Originally Shenxiu was considered to be the "Sixth Patriarch", carrying the mantle of Bodhidharma's Zen through the East Mountain School.  After the death of Shenxiu, his student [[Shenhui]] started a campaign to establish Huineng as the Sixth Ancestor. Eventually Shenhui's position won the day, and Huineng was recognized as the Sixth Patriarch.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The successful promulgation of Shenhui's views led to Shenxiu's branch being widely referred to by others as the "Northern School."  This nomenclature has continued in western scholarship, which for the most part has largely viewed Chinese Zen through the lens of southern Chan.

===Northern and Southern School (南頓北漸)===
The terms Northern and Southern have little to do with geography:
{{quote|Contrary to first impressions, the formula has little to do with geography. Like the general designations of Mahāyāna ("the universal vehicle") and Hīnayāna ("the individual vehicle"), the formula carries with it a value judgement. According to the mainstream of later Zen, not only is sudden enlightenment incomparably superior to gradual experience but it represents true Zen&amp;nbsp;— indeed, it is the very touchstone of authentic Zen.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin 1988 p.107"/&gt;}}

The basic difference is between approaches. Shenhui characterised the Northern School as employing ''gradual teachings'', while his Southern school employed ''sudden teachings'':
{{quote|[[Subitism|suddenness]] of the South, gradualness of the North" (Chinese: ''nan-tun bei qian''; Japanese: ''nanton hokuzen'').&lt;ref name="Dumoulin 1988 p.107"&gt;[[Heinrich Dumoulin|Dumoulin, Heinrich]] (author); Heisig, James W. (trans.) &amp; Knitter, Paul (trans.)(1988). ''Zen Buddhism: A History. Volume 1 India and China''. New York, N.Y.: Macmillan Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-02-908230-7}} (2 vol. set; paper) p.107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term "East Mountain Teaching" is seen as more culturally and historically appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Gary L.(2005). ''The Northern Ch'an School and Sudden Versus Gradual Enlightenment Debates in China and Tibet''.  Source: [http://www.dharmaweb.org/index.php/Ch'an_&amp;_Sudden_and_Gradual_Debates_in_China_and_Tibet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725081221/http://www.dharmaweb.org/index.php/Ch%27an_%26_Sudden_and_Gradual_Debates_in_China_and_Tibet |date=2008-07-25 }} (accessed: December 2, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

But the characterization of Shenxiu's East Mountain Teaching as gradualist is argued to be unfounded in light of the documents found amongst Dunhuang manuscripts recovered from the [[Mogao Caves]] near Dunhuang.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin 1988 p.107"/&gt;  Shenhui's Southern School incorporated Northern teachings as well, and Shenhui himself admittedly saw the need of further practice after initial awakening.{{sfn|McRae|1991}}

===Shenxiu (神秀, 606?-706 CE)===
[[Yuquan Shenxiu]]'s prominent position in the history of Chán, despite the [[Zen#Zen narratives|popular narrative]], is recognized by modern scholarship:
{{quote|No doubt the most important personage within the Northern school is [Shenxiu], a man of high education and widespread notoriety.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin 1988 p.108"/&gt;}}

Kuiken (undated: p.&amp;nbsp;17) in discussing a Dunhuang document of the Tang monk and meditator, 'Jingjue' (靜覺, 683- ca. 750) states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jingjue's Record introduces Hongren of Huangmei 黃梅宏忍 (d.u.) as the main teacher in the sixth generation of the 'southern' or 'East Mountain' meditation tradition. Shenxiu is mentioned as Hongren's authorized successor. In Shenxiu's shadow, Jingjue mentions 'old An' 老安 (see A) as a 'seasoned' meditation teacher and some minor 'local disciples' of Hongren.&lt;ref&gt;Kuiken, Kees (undated). ''The Other Neng 2: Part Two Sources and Resources''. Source: [http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/theology/2002/c.j.kuiken/pt2.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520090223/http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/theology/2002/c.j.kuiken/pt2.pdf |date=2011-05-20 }} (accessed: August 6, 2008) p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shenxiu wrote a treatise on meditation called the ''Kuan-hsin lun'' ("treatise on contemplating the mind"). It combines some of the meditation practices taught by [[Zhiyi]] with ideas from the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Peter N; Traditions of Meditation in Chinese Buddhism, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hui-neng (六祖惠能 or 慧能大師)===
The story of Huineng is famously worded in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'', a text which originated after Shenhui's death. Its core may have originated within the so-called Oxhead school. The text was subsequently edited and enlarged, and reflects various Chán teachings.{{sfn|MacRae|2003}} It de-emphasizes the difference between the Northern and the Southern School.

The first chapter of the Platform Sutra relates the story of Huineng and his inheritance of the East Mountain Teachings.

==Wider influence of the East Mountain Teachings==
The tradition of a list of patriarchs, which granted credibility to the developing tradition, developed early in the Chán tradition:
{{quote|The consciousness of a unique line of transmission of Bodhidharma Zen, which is not yet demonstrable in the Bodhidharma treatise, grew during the seventh century and must have taken shape on the East Mountain prior to the death of the Fourth Patriarch Tao-hsin (580-651). The earliest indication appears in the epitaph for Faru (638-689), one of the '10 outstanding disciples' of the Fifth Patriarch Hongren (601-674). The author of the epitaph is not known, but the list comprises six names: after Bodhidharma and Huike follow Sengcan, Daoxin, Hongren, and Faru. The Ch'uan fa-pao chi takes this list over and adds as a seventh name that of Shen-hsiu (605?-706)&lt;ref name="Dumoulin1993"&gt;Dumoulin, Heinrich (1993). "Early Chinese Zen Reexamined ~ A Supplement to 'Zen Buddhism: A History'" in ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies'' 1993 20/1. Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/387.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304064306/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/387.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2009 }} (accessed: August 6, 2008) p.37&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Faru (法如, 638-689 CE)===
[[Faru (monk)|Faru]] (法如, 638-689) was "the first pioneer" and "actual founder" of the Northern School. His principal teachers were [[Hui-ming]] and Daman Hongren (Hung-jen). He was sent to Hongren by Hui-ming, and attained awakening when studying with Hung-jen&lt;ref name="Dumoulin 1988 p.108"&gt;[[Heinrich Dumoulin|Dumoulin, Heinrich]] (author); Heisig, James W. (trans.) &amp; Knitter, Paul (trans.)(1988). ''Zen Buddhism: A History. Volume 1 India and China''. New York, N.Y.: Macmillan Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-02-908230-7}} (2 vol. set; paper) p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Faru too was credited to be the successor of Hongren. But Faru did not have a good publicist, and he was not included within the list of Chan Patriarchs.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin 1988 p.108" /&gt;
{{quote|In an epitaph for Shenxiu, his name is made to take the place of Faru's. The Leng-ch'ieh shih-tzu chi omits Faru and ends after Shenxiu with the name of his disciple Puji (651-739). These indications from the Northern school argue for the succession of the Third Patriarch Sengcan (d. 606), which has been thrown into doubt because of lacunae in the historical work of Tao-hsuan. Still, the matter cannot be settled with certainty.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin1993" /&gt;}}

Because of Faru, the '[[Shaolin Monastery]]', constructed in 496CE, yet again became prominent.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin 1988 p.108"/&gt; [Faru] had only a brief stay at Shaolin Temple, but during his stay the cloister became the epicentre of the flourishing Chan movement.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin 1988 p.108"/&gt; An epitaph commemorating the success of Faru's pioneering endeavors is located on [[Mount Sung]].&lt;ref name="Dumoulin 1988 p.108"/&gt;

===Baotang Wuzhu===
[[Baotang Wuzhu]] ({{zh|c=保唐无住}}, 714-774), founder and abbot of Baotang Monastery ({{zh|c=保唐寺}}) in [[Chengdu]] in Southwest China was a member of the East Mountain Teachings.

===Moheyan (late eighth century CE, 大乘和尚 or 摩訶衍)===
[[Moheyan]] (late eighth century CE) was a proponent of the Northern School. Moheyan traveled to Dunhuang, which at the time belonged to the [[Tibetan empire#Tibetan Empire|Ancient Tibetan Empire]], in 781 or 787 CE.&lt;ref name="Ray, Gary L. 2005"&gt;Ray, Gary L.(2005). ''The Northern Ch'an School and Sudden Versus Gradual Enlightenment Debates in China and Tibet''&lt;/ref&gt;

Moheyan participated in a prolonged debate with [[Kamalashila]] at Samye in Tibet over sudden versus gradual teachings, which was decisive for the course the Tibetan Buddhist tradition took:
{{quote|As is well known, the fate of Chan [East Mountain Teachings] in Tibet was said to have been decided in a debate at the Samye monastery near Lhasa in c.792-797.&lt;ref&gt;Adamek, Wendi Leigh (2007). ''The mystique of transmission: on an early Chan history and its contexts''. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-13664-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-231-13664-8}}. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9UUND1nST9kC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=moheyan+samye&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=90E2Taf1_c&amp;sig=M4lJY8ZKS7p2lQFiuO6lTykPJlg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0n7IS7_dC8-gkQWHqtXICQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=moheyan%20samye&amp;f=false] (accessed: Saturday April 17, 2010), p.288&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Broughton identifies the Chinese and Tibetan nomenclature of Mohoyen's teachings and identifies them principally with the East Mountain Teachings:
{{quote|Mo-ho-yen's teaching in Tibet as the famed proponent of the all-at-once gate can be summarized as "gazing-at-mind" ([Chinese:] k'an-hsin, [Tibetan:] sems la bltas) and "no examining" ([Chinese:] pu-kuan, [Tibetan:] myi rtog pa) or "no-thought no-examining" ([Chinese:] pu-ssu pu-kuan, [Tibetan:] myi bsam myi rtog). "Gazing-at-mind" is an original Northern (or East Mountain Dharma Gate) teaching. As will become clear, Poa-t'ang and the Northern Ch'an dovetail in the Tibetan sources. Mo-ho-yen's teaching seems typical of late Northern Ch'an. It should be noted that Mo-ho-yen arrived on the central Tibetan scene somewhat late in comparison to the Ch'an transmissions from Szechwan.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Jeffrey (1983). Early Ch'an Schools in Tibet. Cited in: Gimello, Robert M. &amp; Gregory, Peter N. (1983). Studies in Ch'an and Hua-yen.

The teachings of Moheyan and other Chan masters were unified with the Kham Dzogchen lineages {this may or may not be congruent with the Kahma (Tibetan: ''bka' ma'') lineages} through the ''Kunkhyen'' (Tibetan for "omniscient"), [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo]].&lt;ref&gt;Barber, A. W. (1990). ''The Unifying of Rdzogs Pa Chen Po and Ch'an''.  "Chung-Hwa Buddhist Journal". Vol.3 April 1990.

The Dzogchen ("Great Perfection") School of the [[Nyingmapa]] was often identified with the 'sudden enlightenment' (Tibetan: ''cig car gyi ‘jug pa'') of Moheyan and was called to defend itself against this charge by avowed members of the Sarma lineages that held to the staunch view of 'gradual enlightenmnent' (Tibetan: ''rim gyis ‘jug pa'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam van Schaik|van Schaik, Sam]] (2007).

'''Evolutionary biology'''  is the subfield of [[biology]] that studies the [[evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life]] on [[Earth]], starting from [[Last universal common ancestor|a single common ancestor]]. These processes include [[natural selection]], [[common descent]], and [[speciation]].

The discipline emerged through what [[Julian Huxley]] called the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] (of the 1930s) of understanding from several previously unrelated fields of biological research, including [[genetics]], [[ecology]], [[systematics]], and [[paleontology]].

Current research has widened to cover the [[genetic architecture]] of adaptation, [[molecular evolution]], and the different forces that contribute to evolution including [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]] and [[biogeography]]. The newer field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] ("evo-devo") investigates how [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] is controlled, thus creating a wider synthesis that integrates [[developmental biology]] with the fields covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis.

==Subfields==
[[Evolution]] is the central unifying concept in biology. Biology can be divided in various ways. One way is by the level of [[biological organisation]], from  [[molecular biology|molecular]] to [[cell biology|cell]], organism to [[population biology|population]]. An earlier way is by perceived [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic group]], with fields such as [[zoology]], [[botany]], and [[microbiology]], reflecting what were once seen as the major divisions of life.
A third way is by approach, such as field biology, [[theoretical biology]], [[experimental evolution]], and paleontology. These alternative ways of dividing up the subject can be combined with evolutionary biology to create subfields like [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[evolutionary developmental biology]].

More recently, the merge between the biological science and applied sciences gave birth to new fields that are extensions of evolutionary biology, such as [[evolutionary robotics]], engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ls.toyaku.ac.jp/~lcb-7/en/keywords/evolutionaryengineering.html|title=Evolutionary engineering|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216072919/http://www.ls.toyaku.ac.jp/~lcb-7/en/keywords/evolutionaryengineering.html|archivedate=16 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary algorithms|algorithms]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/ecbook/Eiben-Smith-Intro2EC-Ch2.pdf|title=What is an Evolutionary Algorithm?|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809084921/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/ecbook/Eiben-Smith-Intro2EC-Ch2.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary economics|economics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/evolute.html|title=What economists can learn from evolutionary theorists|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730010043/http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/evolute.html|archivedate=30 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-eaed1/index.html|title=Investigating architecture and design|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818215737/https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-eaed1/index.html|archivedate=18 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic mechanisms of evolution are applied directly or indirectly to come up with novel designs or solve problems that are difficult to solve otherwise. The research generated in these applied fields in turn contribute to progress, especially thanks to work on evolution in [[computer science]] and engineering fields such as [[mechanical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642072857|title=Introduction to Evolutionary Computing: A.E.

== History ==
{{Main|History of evolutionary thought}}

The idea of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] was proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1859, but evolutionary biology, as an [[academic discipline]] in its own right, emerged during the period of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smocovitis |first=Vassiliki Betty |year=1996 |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03343-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1980s that many universities had departments of evolutionary biology. In the [[United States]], many universities have created departments of ''molecular and cell biology'' or ''ecology and evolutionary biology'', in place of the older departments of [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. [[Palaeontology]] is often grouped with [[earth science]].

[[Microbiology]] too is becoming an evolutionary discipline, now that microbial physiology and [[genomics]] are better understood. The quick generation time of bacteria and [[virus]]es such as [[bacteriophage]]s makes it possible to explore evolutionary questions.

Many biologists have contributed to shaping the modern discipline of evolutionary biology. [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] and [[E. B. Ford]] established an empirical research programme. [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Sewall Wright]] and [[J. S. Haldane]] created a sound theoretical framework. [[Ernst Mayr]] in [[systematics]], [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in paleontology and [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] in [[botany]] helped to form the modern synthesis.

== Current research topics ==
Current research in evolutionary biology covers diverse topics and incorporates ideas from diverse areas, such as [[molecular genetics]] and [[computer science]].

First, some fields of evolutionary research try to explain phenomena that were poorly accounted for in the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. These include [[speciation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2004 |title=What is speciation and how should we study it? |journal= American Naturalist |volume=163 |issue=6 |pages=914–923 |doi= 10.1086/386552 |jstor=10.1086/386552 |author=Wiens JJ |pmid=15266388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[evolution of sexual reproduction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2009 |title=The evolutionary enigma of sex |journal= American Naturalist |volume=174 |issue=s1 |pages=S1–S14 |doi=10.1086/599084 |author=Otto SP |pmid=19441962}}&lt;/ref&gt; the evolution of [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperation]], the [[evolution of ageing]], and [[evolvability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2007 |title=Evolvability as the proper focus of evolutionary developmental biology |journal= Evolution &amp; Development |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=393–401 |doi= 10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00176.x |author=Jesse Love Hendrikse |author2=Trish Elizabeth Parsons |author3=Benedikt Hallgrímsson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, biologists ask the most straightforward evolutionary question: "what happened and when?". This includes fields such as [[paleobiology]], as well as [[systematics]] and [[phylogenetics]].

Third, the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when nobody understood the molecular basis of genes. Today, evolutionary biologists try to determine the [[genetic architecture]] of interesting evolutionary phenomena such as [[adaptation]] and speciation. They seek answers to questions such as how many genes are involved, how large are the effects of each gene, how interdependent are the effects of different genes, what do the genes do, and what changes happen to them (e.g., [[point mutations]] vs. [[gene duplication]] or even [[polyploidy|genome duplication]]). They try to reconcile the high [[heritability]] seen in [[twin studies]] with the difficulty in finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using [[genome-wide association studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2009|title=Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases|journal=Nature|volume=461|issue=7265|pages=747–753|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7265/full/nature08494.html|doi=10.1038/nature08494|author=Manolio TA|author2=Collins FS|author3=Cox NJ|author4=Goldstein DB|author5=Hindorff LA|author6=Hunter DJ|author7=McCarthy MI|author8=Ramos EM|author9=Cardon LR|author10=Chakravarti A|author11=Cho JH|author12=Guttmacher AE|author13=Kong A|author14=Kruglyak L|author15=Mardis E|author16=Rotimi CN|author17=Slatkin M|author18=Valle D|author19=Whittemore AS|author20=Boehnke M|author21=Clark AG|author22=Eichler EE|author23=Gibson G|author24=Haines JL|author25=Mackay TFC|author26=McCarroll SA|author27=Visscher PM|pmid=19812666|pmc=2831613|bibcode=2009Natur.461..747M|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729160819/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7265/full/nature08494.html|archivedate=29 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One challenge in studying genetic architecture is that the classical [[population genetics]] that catalysed the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] must be updated to take into account modern molecular knowledge. This requires a great deal of mathematical development to relate DNA sequence data to evolutionary theory as part of a theory of [[molecular evolution]]. For example, biologists try to infer which genes have been under strong selection by detecting [[selective sweeps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2002 |title=Detecting recent positive selection in the human genome from haplotype structure |journal=Nature |volume=419 |pages=832–837 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6909/full/nature01140.html |doi=10.1038/nature01140 |issue=6909 |pmid=12397357 |author=Sabeti PC |author2=Reich DE |author3=Higgins JM |author4=Levine HZP |author5=Richter DJ |author6=Schaffner SF |author7=Gabriel SB |author8=Platko JV |author9=Patterson NJ |author10=McDonald GJ |author11=Ackerman HC |author12=Campbell SJ |author13=Altshuler D |author14=Cooper R |author15=Kwiatkowski D |author16=Ward R |author17=Lander ES |bibcode=2002Natur.419..832S |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327154520/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6909/full/nature01140.html |archivedate=27 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth, the modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement about which forces contribute to evolution, but not about their relative importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1988| title=Evolutionary progress |chapter= Progress in evolution and meaning in life | pages=49–79 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |author=Provine WB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research seeks to determine this. Evolutionary forces include [[natural selection]], [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[genetic hitchhiking|genetic draft]], developmental constraints, mutation bias and [[biogeography]].

An evolutionary approach is key to much current research in organismal biology and [[ecology]], such as in [[life history theory]]. [[Gene finding|Annotation of genes]] and their function relies heavily on comparative approaches. The field of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo")]] investigates how developmental processes work, and compares them in different organisms to determine how they evolved.

==Journals==
Some [[scientific journal]]s specialise exclusively in evolutionary biology as a whole, including the journals ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'', ''[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]]'', and ''[[BMC Evolutionary Biology]]''. Some journals cover sub-specialties within evolutionary biology, such as the journals ''[[Systematic Biology]]'', ''[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]]'' and its sister journal ''Genome Biology and Evolution'', and ''[[Cladistics (journal)|Cladistics]].

Other journals combine aspects of evolutionary biology with other related fields. For example, ''[[Molecular Ecology]]'', ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society#Proceedings of the Royal Society B|Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B]]'', ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' and ''Theoretical Population Biology'' have overlap with ecology and other aspects of organismal biology. Overlap with ecology is also prominent in the review journals ''[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]]'' and ''[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]]''. The journals ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' and ''[[PLoS Genetics]]'' overlap with molecular genetics questions that are not obviously evolutionary in nature.

'''Ferdinand Canning Scott Schiller''' (16 August 1864 – 6 August 1937), usually cited as '''F. C. S. Schiller''', was a German-British philosopher. Born in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Holstein]] (at that time member of the [[German Confederation]], but under Danish administration), Schiller studied at the [[University of Oxford]], later was a professor there, after being invited back after a brief time at [[Cornell University]]. Later in his life he taught at the [[University of Southern California]]. In his lifetime he was well known as a philosopher; after his death his work was largely forgotten.

Schiller's philosophy was very similar to and often aligned with the [[pragmatism]] of [[William James]], although Schiller referred to it as "[[humanism]]". He argued vigorously against both [[logical positivism]] and associated philosophers (for example, [[Bertrand Russell]]) as well as [[absolute idealism]] (such as [[F. H. Bradley]]).

Schiller was an early supporter of [[evolution]] and a founding member of the [[English Eugenics Society]].

== Life ==
Born in 1864, one of three brothers and the son of Ferdinand Schiller (a [[Calcutta]] merchant), Schiller's family home was in Switzerland. Schiller grew up in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]. He was educated at [[Rugby School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], and graduated in the first class of ''[[Literae Humaniores]]'', winning later the Taylorian scholarship for German in 1887. Schiller's first book, ''Riddles of the Sphinx'' (1891), was an immediate success despite his use of a pseudonym because of his fears concerning how the book would be received. Between the years 1893 and 1897 he was an instructor in philosophy at Cornell University. In 1897 he returned to Oxford and became fellow and tutor of [[Corpus Christi, Oxford|Corpus Christi]] for more than thirty years. Schiller was president of the Aristotelian Society in 1921, and was for many years treasurer of the Mind Association. In 1926 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In 1929 he was appointed visiting professor in the University of Southern California, and spent half of each year in the United States and half in England. Schiller died in Los Angeles either 6, 7 or 9 August 1937 after a long and lingering illness.&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary: Prof. F.C.S. Schiller" ''Nature'' 140, 454–455 (11 September 1937), [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v140/n3541/abs/140454a0.html link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Notes: Dr. F.C.S. Schiller (1864–1937)" ''Mind'', Vol. 47, No. 185, Jan 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiller was a founding member of the English Eugenics Society and published three books on the subject; ''Tantalus or the Future of Man'' (1924), ''Eugenics and Politics'' (1926), and ''Social Decay and Eugenic Reform'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;"F.C.S. Schiller" in ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'', 2008, edited by John Lachs and Robert Talisse.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

In 1891, F.C.S. Schiller made his first contribution to philosophy anonymously. Schiller feared that in his time of high [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], the metaphysical speculations of his ''Riddles of the Sphinx'' were likely to hurt his professional prospects (p. xi, ''Riddles''). However, Schiller's fear of reprisal from his anti-metaphysical colleagues should not suggest that Schiller was a friend of [[metaphysics]]. Like his fellow pragmatists across the ocean, Schiller was attempting to stake out an intermediate position between both the spartan landscape of naturalism and the speculative excesses of the metaphysics of his time. In ''Riddles'' Schiller both, 
::(1) accuses naturalism (which he also sometimes calls "pseudometaphysics" or "[[positivism]]") of ignoring the fact that metaphysics is required to justify our natural description of the world, and
::(2) accuses "abstract metaphysics" of losing sight of the world we actually live in and constructing grand, disconnected imaginary worlds.
The result, Schiller contends, is that naturalism cannot make sense of the "higher" aspects of our world ([[freewill]], [[consciousness]], God, purpose, [[universals]]), while abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the "lower" aspects of our world (the imperfect, change, physicality). In each case we are unable to guide our moral and [[epistemological]] "lower" lives to the achievement of life's "higher" ends, ultimately leading to [[scepticism]] on both fronts. For [[knowledge]] and morality to be possible, both the world's lower and higher elements must be real; e.g. we need universals (a higher) to make knowledge of [[particulars]] (a lower) possible. This would lead Schiller to argue for what he at the time called a "concrete metaphysics", but would later call "humanism".

Shortly after publishing ''Riddles of the Sphinx'', Schiller became acquainted with the work of pragmatist philosopher William James and this changed the course of his career. For a time, Schiller's work became focused on extending and developing James' pragmatism (under Schiller's preferred title, "humanism"). Schiller even revised his earlier work ''Riddles of the Sphinx'' to make the nascent pragmatism implicit in that work more explicit. In one of Schiller's most prominent works during this phase of his career, "Axioms as Postulates" (1903), Schiller extended James' will to believe doctrine to show how it could be used to justify not only an acceptance of God, but also our acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more.

Towards the end of his career, Schiller's pragmatism began to take on a character more distinct from the pragmatism of William James. Schiller's focus became his opposition to formal logic. To understand Schiller's opposition to formal logic, consider the following inference: 
::(1) All salt is soluble in water;
::(2) [[Cerebos]] is not soluble in water;
::(3) Therefore, Cerebos is not a salt.
From the formal characteristics of this inference alone (All As are Bs; c is not a B; Therefore, c is not an A), formal logic would judge this to be a valid inference. Schiller, however, refused to evaluate the validity of this inference merely on its formal characteristics. Schiller argued that unless we look to the contextual fact regarding what specific problem first prompted this inference to actually occur, we can not determine whether the inference was successful (i.e. pragmatically successful). In the case of this inference, since "Cerebos is 'salt' for culinary, but not for chemical purposes",&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1930) page 276&lt;/ref&gt; without knowing whether the purpose for this piece of reasoning was culinary or chemical we cannot determine whether this is valid or not. In another example, Schiller discusses the truth of formal mathematics "1+1=2" and points out that this [[equation]] does not hold if one is discussing drops of water. Schiller's attack on formal logic and formal mathematics never gained much attention from philosophers, however it does share some weak similarities to the [[contextualism|contextualist]] view in [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary epistemology]] as well as the views of [[Ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language philosophers]]. (The "All salt is soluble in water," argument is valid according to both Aristotelian and Boolean forms of logic as Mood A-O-O, figure 2.  The issue regarding testing for validity and/or soundness is whether or not Cerebos is water-soluble, alone, no matter the use of the salt.  One would not want to use insoluble salt in cooking, but such an issue does not effect whether or not such salt is water-soluble).

=== Opposition to naturalism and metaphysics ===

In ''Riddles'', Schiller gives historical examples of the dangers of abstract metaphysics in the philosophies of [[Plato]], [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], portraying Hegel as the worst offender: "Hegelianism never anywhere gets within sight of a fact, or within touch of reality. And the reason is simple: you cannot, without paying the penalty, substitute abstractions for realities; the thought-symbol cannot do duty for the thing symbolized".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) ''Riddles of the Sphinx'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiller argued that the flaw in Hegel's system, as with all systems of abstract metaphysics, is that the world it constructs always proves to be unhelpful in guiding our imperfect, changing, particular, and physical lives to the achievement of the "higher" universal Ideals and Ends. For example, Schiller argues that the reality of [[Identity and change|time and change]] is intrinsically opposed to the very [[modus operandi]] of all systems of abstract metaphysics. He says that the possibility to change is a precondition of any moral action (or action generally), and so any system of abstract metaphysics is bound to lead us into a [[moral scepticism]]. 
The problem lies in the aim of abstract metaphysics for "interpreting the world in terms of conceptions, which should be true not here and now, but "[[eternity|eternally]]" and independently of Time and Change." The result is that metaphysics must use conceptions that have the "time-aspect of Reality" abstracted away. Of course, "[o]nce abstracted from,"

{{quote|the reference to Time could not, of course, be recovered, any more than the individuality of Reality can be deduced, when once ignored. The assumption is made that, to express the 'truth' about Reality, its '[[Haecceity|thisness]],' individuality, change and its immersion in a certain temporal and spatial environment may be neglected, and the timeless validity of a conception is thus substituted for the living, changing and perishing existence we contemplate. ... What I wish here to point out is merely that it is unreasonable to expect from such premises to arrive at a [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] justification of the very characteristics of Reality that have been excluded.

The true reason, then, why Hegelism can give no reason for the Time-process, i.e. for the fact that the world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, is that it was constructed to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable '[[truth]],' you can get it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will enable you to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience. And it is part of the price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset as irrelevant to a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1894) "The Metaphysics of the Time-Process"; republished on pages 98–99 of ''Humanism'' (1903)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While abstract metaphysics provides us with a world of beauty and purpose and various other "highers", it condemns other key aspects of the world we live in as imaginary. The world of abstract metaphysics has no place for imperfect moral agents who (1) strive to learn about the world and then (2) act upon the world to change it for the better. Consequently, abstract metaphysics condemns us as illusionary, and declares our place in the world as unimportant and purposeless. Where abstractions take priority, our concrete lives collapse into scepticism and [[pessimism]].

He also makes a case against the alternative naturalist method, saying that this too results in an epistemological and moral scepticism. Schiller looks to show this method's inadequacy at moving from the cold, lifeless lower world of atoms to the higher world of ethics, meanings, and minds. As with abstract metaphysics, Schiller attacks naturalism on many fronts: (1) the naturalist method is unable to reduce universals to particulars, (2) the naturalist method is unable to reduce freewill to determinist movements, (3) the naturalist method is unable to reduce [[emergence|emergent properties]] like consciousness to brain activity, (4) the naturalist method is unable to reduce God into a [[pantheism]], and so on. Just as the abstract method cannot find a place for the lower elements of our world inside the higher, the naturalist method cannot find a place for the higher elements of our world inside the lower. In a reversal of abstract metaphysics, naturalism denies the reality of the higher elements to save the lower. Schiller uses the term "pseudo-metaphysical" here instead of naturalism—as he sometimes does—because he is accusing these naturalist philosophers of trying to solve metaphysical problems while sticking to the non-metaphysical "lower" aspects of the world (i.e. without engaging in real metaphysics): 

{{quote|
The pseudo-metaphysical method puts forward the method of science as the method of philosophy. But it is doomed to perpetual failure. ... [T]he data supplied by the physical sciences are intractable, because they are data of a lower sort than the facts they are to explain.

The objects of the physical sciences form the lower orders in the [[hierarchy]] of existence, more extensive but less significant. Thus the atoms of the physicist may indeed be found in the organisation of conscious beings, but they are subordinate: a living organism exhibits actions which cannot be formulated by the laws of physics alone; man is material, but he is also a great deal more.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To show that the world's higher elements do not reduce to the lower is not yet to show that naturalism must condemn the world's higher elements as illusionary. A second component to Schiller's attack is showing that naturalism cannot escape its inability to reduce the higher to the lower by asserting that these higher elements evolve from the lower. However, Schiller does not see naturalism as any more capable of explaining the evolution of the higher from the lower than it is capable of reducing the higher to the lower. While evolution does begin with something lower that in turn evolves into something higher, the problem for naturalism is that whatever the starting point for evolution is, it must first be something with the potential to evolve into a higher. For example, the world cannot come into existence from nothing because the potential or "germ" of the world is not "in" nothing (nothing has no potential, it has nothing; after all, it is nothing). Likewise, biological evolution cannot begin from inanimate matter, because the potential for life is not "in" inanimate matter. The following passage shows Schiller applying the same sort of reasoning to the evolution of consciousness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Taken as the type of the pseudo-metaphysical method, which explains the higher by the lower ... it does not explain the genesis of consciousness out of unconscious matter, because we cannot, or do not, attribute potential consciousness to matter. ... the theory of Evolution derives the [end result] from its germ, i.e., from that which was, what it became, potentially.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unable to either reduce or explain the evolution of the higher elements of our world, naturalism is left to explain away the higher elements as mere illusions. In doing this, naturalism condemns us to a scepticism in the both epistemology and ethics. It is worth noting, that while Schiller's work has been largely neglected since his death, Schiller's arguments against a naturalistic account of evolution have been recently cited by advocates of [[intelligent design]] to establish the existence of a longer history for the view due to legal concerns in the United States (See: [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]).

=== Humanist alternative to metaphysics and naturalism ===

Schiller argued that both abstract metaphysics and naturalism portray man as holding an intolerable position in the world. He proposed a method that not only recognises the lower world we interact with, but takes into account the higher world of purposes, ideals and abstractions. Schiller: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We require, then, a method which combines the excellencies of both the pseudo-metaphysical and the abstract metaphysical, if philosophy is to be possible at all.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schiller was demanding a course correction in field of metaphysics, putting it at the service of science.  For example, to explain the creation of the world out of nothing, or to explain the emergence or evolution of the "higher" parts of the world, Schiller introduces a divine being who might generate the end (i.e. [[Four causes|Final Cause]]) which gives [[nothing]]ness, lifelessness, and unconscious matter the purpose (and thus potential) of evolving into higher forms: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;And thus, so far from dispensing with the need for a Divine First Cause, the [[Evolution|theory of evolution]], if only we have the faith in science to carry it to its conclusion, and the courage to interpret it, proves irrefragably that no evolution was possible without a pre-existent Deity, and a Deity, moreover, transcendent, non-material and non-phenomenal. ... [T]he world process is the working out of an anterior purpose or idea in the divine consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This re-introduction of [[teleology]] (which Schiller sometimes calls a re-anthropomorphizing of the world) is what Schiller says the naturalist has become afraid to do. Schiller's method of concrete metaphysics (i.e. his humanism) allows for an appeal to metaphysics when science demands it. However: 

{{quote|[T]he new teleology would not be capricious or random in its application, but firmly rooted in the conclusions of the sciences ... The process which the theory of Evolution divined the history of the world to be, must have content and meaning determined from the basis of the scientific data; it is only by a careful study of the history of a thing that we can determine the direction of its development, [and only then] that we can be said to have made the first approximation to the knowledge of the End of the world process.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

[This] is teleology of a totally different kind to that which is so vehemently, and on the whole so justly dreaded by the modern exponents of natural science. It does not attempt to explain things anthropocentrically, or regard all creation as existing for the use and benefit of man; it is as far as the scientist from supposing that cork-trees grow to supply us with champagne corks. The end to which it supposes all things to subserve is ... the universal End of the world-process, to which all things tend[.]&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schiller finally reveals what this "End" is which "all things tend": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If our speculations have not entirely missed their mark, the world-process will come to an end when all the spirits whom it is designed to harmonise [by its Divine Creator] have been united in a perfect society.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, while by today's philosophic standards Schiller's speculations would be considered wildly metaphysical and disconnected from the sciences, compared with the metaphysicians of his day (Hegel, McTaggart, etc.), Schiller saw himself as radically scientific. Schiller gave his philosophy a number of labels during his career. Early on he used the names "Concrete Metaphysics" and "Anthropomorphism", while later in life tending towards "Pragmatism" and particularly "Humanism".

=== The Will to Believe ===

Schiller also developed a method of philosophy intended to mix elements of both naturalism and abstract metaphysics in a way that allows us to avoid the twin scepticisms each method collapses into when followed on its own. However, Schiller does not assume that this is enough to justify his humanism over the other two methods. He accepts the possibility that both scepticism and pessimism are true.

To justify his attempt to occupy the middle ground between naturalism and abstract metaphysics, Schiller makes a move that anticipates James' [[will to believe doctrine|The Will to Believe]]:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;And in action especially we are often forced to act upon slight possibilities. Hence, if it can be shown that our solution is a possible answer, and the only possible alternative to pessimism, to a complete despair of life, it would deserve acceptance, even though it were but a bare possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1891) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schiller contends that in light of the other methods' failure to provide humans with a role and place in the universe, we ought avoid the adoption of these methods. By the end of ''Riddles'', Schiller offers his method of humanism as the only possible method that results in a world where we can navigate our lower existence to the achievement of our higher purpose.  He asserts that it is the method we ought to adopt regardless of the evidence against it ("even though it were but a bare possibility").

While Schiller's will to believe is a central theme of ''Riddle of the Sphinx'' (appearing mainly in the introduction and conclusion of his text), in 1891 the doctrine held a limited role in Schiller's philosophy. In ''Riddles'', Schiller only employs his version of the will to believe doctrine when he is faced with overcoming sceptic and pessimistic methods of philosophy. In 1897, William James published his essay "The Will to Believe" and this influenced Schiller to drastically expanded his application of the doctrine. For a 1903 volume titled ''Personal Idealism'', Schiller contributed a widely read essay titled "Axioms as Postulates" in which he sets out to justify the "[[axiom]]s of logic" as postulates adopted on the basis of the will to believe doctrine. In this essay Schiller extends the will to believe doctrine to be the basis of our acceptance of [[causality]], of the [[Principle of uniformity|uniformity of nature]], of our concept of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], of [[contradiction]], of the [[law of excluded middle]], of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more. He notes that we postulate that nature is uniform because we ''need'' nature to be uniform: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[O]ut of the hurly-burly of events in time and space [we] extract[ ] changeless formulas whose chaste abstraction soars above all reference to any 'where' or 'when,' and thereby renders them blank cheques to be filled up at our pleasure with any figures of the sort. The only question is—Will Nature honour the cheque? Audentes Natura juvat—let us take our life in our hands and try! If we fail, our blood will be on our own hands (or, more probably, in some one else's stomach), but though we fail, we are in no worse case than those who dared not postulate ... Our assumption, therefore, is at least a methodological necessity; it may turn out to be (or be near) a fundamental fact in nature [an axiom].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1903) "Axioms as Postulates", p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	
Schiller stresses that doctrines like the uniformity of nature must first be postulated on the basis of need (not evidence) and only then "justified by the evidence of their practical working."  He attacks both empiricists like [[John Stuart Mill]], who try to conclude that nature is uniform from previous experience, as well as [[Immanuel Kant|Kantians]] who conclude that nature is uniform from the preconditions on our understanding. Schiller argues that preconditions are not conclusions, but demands made on our experience that may or may not work. On this success hinges our continued acceptance of the postulate and its eventual promotion to axiom status.

In "Axioms and Postulates" Schiller vindicates the postulation by its success in practice, marking an important shift from ''Riddles of a Sphinx''. In ''Riddles'', Schiller is concerned with the vague aim of connecting the "higher" to the "lower" so he can avoid scepticism, but by 1903 he has clarified the connection he sees between these two elements. The "higher" abstract elements are connected to the lower because they are our inventions for dealing with the lower; their truth depends on their success as tools. Schiller dates the entry of this element into his thinking in his 1892 essay "Reality and 'Idealism'" (a mere year after his 1891 ''Riddles'').
  	
{{quote|&gt;The plain man's 'things,' the physicist's 'atoms,' and Mr. Ritchie's 'Absolute,' are all of them more or less preserving and well-considered schemes to interpret the primary reality of phenomena, and in this sense Mr. Ritchie is entitled to call the 'sunrise' a theory. But the chaos of presentations, out of which we have (by criteria ultimately practical) isolated the phenomena we subsequently call sunrise, is not a theory, but the fact which has called all theories into being.	

In addition to generating hypothetical objects to explain phenomena, the interpretation of reality by our thought also bestows a derivative reality on the abstractions with which thought works. If they are the instruments wherewith thought accomplishes such effects upon reality, they must surely be themselves real.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1892) "Reality and 'Idealism'"; reprinted on p. 120 of ''Humanism'' (1903)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The shift in Schiller's thinking continues in his next published work, ''The Metaphysics of the Time-Process'' (1895): 
The abstractions of metaphysics, then, exist as explanations of the concrete facts of life, and not the latter as illustrations of the former ... Science [along with humanism] does not refuse to interpret the symbols with which it operates; on the contrary, it is only their applicability to the concrete facts originally abstracted from that is held to justify their use and to establish their 'truth.'&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1895) "The Metaphysics of the Time-Process"; also reprinted on pages 102–103 of ''Humanism'' (1903)&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiller's accusations against the metaphysician in ''Riddles'' now appear in a more pragmatic light. His objection is similar to one we might make against a worker who constructs a flat-head [[screwdriver]] to help him build a home, and who then accuses a screw of unreality when he comes upon a Phillips-screw that his flat-head screwdriver won't fit. In his works after ''Riddles'', Schiller's attack takes the form of reminding the abstract metaphysician that abstractions are meant as tools for dealing with the "lower" world of particulars and physicality, and that after constructing abstractions we cannot simply drop the un-abstracted world out of our account. The un-abstracted world is the entire reason for making abstractions in the first place. We did not abstract to reach the unchanging and eternal truths; we abstract to construct an imperfect and rough tool for dealing with life in our particular and concrete world. It is the working of the higher in "making predictions about the future behavior of things for the purpose of shaping the future behavior of things for the purpose of shaping our own conduct accordingly" that justifies the higher.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1903) ''Humanism'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;To assert this methodological character of eternal truths is not, of course, to deny their validity ... To say that we assume the truth of abstraction because we wish to attain certain ends, is to subordinate theoretic 'truth' to a teleological implication; to say that, the assumption once made, its truth is 'proved' by its practical working ... For the question of the 'practical' working of a truth will always ultimately be found to resolve itself into the question whether we can live by it.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1903) ''Humanism'' p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few lines down from this passage Schiller adds the following footnote in a 1903 reprint of the essay: "All this seems a very fairly definite anticipation of modern pragmatism." Indeed, it resembles the pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's pragmatism was still very different from both that of William James and that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

=== Opposition to logic ===

As early as 1891 Schiller had independently reached a doctrine very similar to William James' [[Will to Believe]]. As early as 1892 Schiller had independently developed his own pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's concern with meaning was one he entirely imports from the pragmatisms of James and Peirce. Later in life Schiller musters all of these elements of his pragmatism to make a concerted attack on formal logic. Concerned with bringing down the timeless, perfect worlds of abstract metaphysics early in life, the central target of Schiller's developed pragmatism is the abstract rules of formal logic. Statements, Schiller contends, cannot possess meaning or truth abstracted away from their actual use. Therefore, examining their formal features instead of their function in an actual situation is to make the same mistake the abstract metaphysician makes. Symbols are meaningless scratches on paper unless they are given a life in a situation, and meant by someone to accomplish some task. They are tools for dealing with concrete situations, and not the proper subjects of study themselves.

Both Schiller's theory of truth and meaning (i.e. Schiller's pragmatism) derive their justification from an examination of thought from what he calls his humanist viewpoint (his new name for concrete metaphysics). He informs us that to answer "what precisely is meant by having a meaning" will require us to "raise the prior question of why we think at all.".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1930) p.51&lt;/ref&gt; A question Schiller of course looks to evolution to provide.

Schiller provides a detailed defence of his pragmatist theories of truth and meaning in a chapter titled "The Biologic of Judgment" in ''Logic for Use'' (1929). The account Schiller lays out in many ways resembles some of what Peirce asserts in his "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877) essay:

{{quote|Our account of the function of Judgment in our mental life will, however, have to start a long way back. For there is much thinking before there is any judging, and much living before there is any thinking. Even in highly developed minds judging is a relatively rare incident in thinking, and thinking in living, an exception rather than the rule, and a relatively recent acquisition.

...

For the most part the living organism adapts itself to it conditions of life by earlier, easier, and quicker expedients. Its actions or reactions are mostly 'reflex actions' determined by inherited habits which largely function automatically ... It follows from this elaborate and admirable organisation of adaptive responses to stimulation that organic life might proceed without thinking altogether. ... This is, in fact, the way in which most living being carry on their life, and the plane on which man also lives most of the time.

Thought, therefore, is an abnormality which springs from a disturbance. Its genesis is connected with a peculiar deficiency in the life of habit. ... Whenever ... it becomes biologically important to notice differences in roughly similar situations, and to adjust action more closely to the peculiarities of a particular case, the guidance of life by habit, instinct, and impulse breaks down. A new expedient has somehow to be devised for effecting such exact and delicate adjustments. This is the raison d'etre of what is variously denominated 'thought,' 'reason,' 'reflection,' 'reasoning,' and 'judgment[.]'

...

Thinking, however, is not so much a substitute for the earlier processes as a subsidiary addition to them. It only pays in certain cases, and intelligence may be shown also by discerning what they are and when it is wiser to act without thinking. ... Philosophers, however, have very mistaken ideas about rational action. They tend to think that men ought to think all the time, and about all things. But if they did this they would get nothing done, and shorten their lives without enhancing their merriment. Also they utterly misconceive the nature of rational action. They represent it as consisting in the perpetual use of universal rules, whereas it consists rather in perceiving when a general rule must be set aside in order that conduct may be adapted to a particular case.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1929) ''Logic For Use'', pages 197–198&lt;/ref&gt;}}		

This passage of Schiller was worth quoting at length because of the insight this chapter offers into Schiller's philosophy. In the passage, Schiller makes the claim that thought only occurs when our unthinking habits prove themselves inadequate for handling a particular situation. Schiller's stressing of the genesis of limited occurrences of thought sets Schiller up for his account of meaning and truth.

Schiller asserts that when a person utters a statement in a situation they are doing so for a specific purpose: to solve the problem that habit could not handle alone. The meaning of such a statement is whatever contribution it makes to accomplishing the purpose of this particular occurrence of thought. The truth of the statement will be if it helps accomplishes that purpose. No utterance or thought can be given a meaning or a truth valuation outside the context of one of these particular occurrences of thought. This account of Schiller's is a much more extreme view than even James took.

At first glance, Schiller appears very similar to James. However, Schiller's more stringent requirement that meaningful statements have consequences "to some one for some purpose" makes Schiller's position more extreme than James'. For Schiller, it is not a sufficient condition for meaningfulness that a statement entail experiential consequences (as it is for both Peirce and James). Schiller requires that the consequences of a statement make the statement relevant to some particular person's goals at a specific moment in time if it is to be meaningful. Therefore, it is not simply enough that the statement "diamonds are hard" and the statement "diamonds are soft" entail different experiential consequences, it is also required that the experiential difference makes a difference to someone's purposes. Only then, and only to that person, do the two statements state something different. If the experiential difference between hard and soft diamonds did not connect up with my purpose for entering into thought, the two statements would possess the same meaning. For example, if I were to randomly blurt out "diamonds are hard" and then "diamonds are soft" to everyone in a coffee shop one day, my words would mean nothing. Words can only mean something if they are stated with a specific purpose.

Consequently, Schiller rejects the idea that statements can have meaning or truth when they are looked upon in the abstract, away from a particular context. "Diamonds are hard" only possesses meaning when stated (or believed) at some specific situation, by some specific person, uttered (or believed) for some specific aim. It is the consequences the statement holds for that person's purposes which constitute its meaning, and its usefulness in accomplishing that person's purposes that constitutes the statement's truth or falsity. After all, when we look at the sentence "diamonds are hard" in a particular situation we may find it actually has nothing to say about diamonds. A speaker may very well be using the sentence as a joke, as a codephrase, or even simply as an example of a sentence with 15 letters. Which the sentence really means cannot be determined without the specific purpose a person might be using the statement for in a specific context.

In an article titled "Pragmatism and Pseudo-pragmatism" Schiller defends his pragmatism against a particular [[counterexample]] in a way that sheds considerable light on his pragmatism:	

&lt;blockquote&gt;The impossibility of answering truly the question whether the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal in the evaluation of Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and—triumphantly refute his own contention!&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1906) "Pragmatism and Pseudo-pragmatism", p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We might recognise this claim as the sort of absurdity many philosophers try to read into the pragmatism of William James. James, however, would not agree that the meaning of "the 100th decimal of [[Pi]] is 9" and "the 100th decimal of Pi is 6" mean the same thing until someone has a reason to care about any possible difference. Schiller, in constast, does mean to say this. 
James and Schiller both treat truth as something that happens to a statement, and so James would agree that it only becomes true that the 100th decimal of Pi is 9 when someone in fact believes that statement and it leads them to their goals, but nowhere does James imply that meaning is something that happens to a statement. That is a unique element of Schiller's pragmatism.

=== Humanist theory of meaning and truth ===

While Schiller felt greatly indebted to the pragmatism of William James, Schiller was outright hostile to the pragmatism of C.S. Peirce. Both Schiller and James struggled with what Peirce intended with his pragmatism, and both were often baffled by Peirce's insistent rebuffing of what they both saw as the natural elaboration of the pragmatist cornerstone he himself first laid down. On the basis of his misunderstandings, Schiller complains that for Peirce to merely say "'truths should have practical consequences'" is to be "very vague, and hints at no reason for the curious connexion it asserts." Schiller goes on to denigrate Peirce's principle as nothing more than a simple truism "which hardly deserves a permanent place and name in philosophic usage". After all, Schiller points out, "[i]t is hard ... to see why even the extremest intellectualism should deny that the difference between the truth and the falsehood of an assertion must show itself in some visible way."&lt;ref name=A&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1905) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

With Peirce's attempts to restrict the use of pragmatism set aside, Schiller unpacks the term "consequences" to provide what he considers as a more substantial restatement of Peirce's pragmatism:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;For to say that a [statement] has consequences and that what has none is meaningless, must surely mean that it has a bearing upon some human interest; they must be consequences to some one for some purpose.&lt;ref name=A/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schiller believes his pragmatism to be more developed because of its attention to the fact that the "consequences" which make up the meaning and truth of a statement, must always be consequences for someone's particular purposes at some particular time. Continuing his condemnation of the abstract, Schiller contends that the meaning of a concept is not the consequences of some abstract proposition, but what consequences an actual thinker hopes its use will bring about in an actual situation. The meaning of a thought is what consequences one means to bring about when they employ the thought. To Schiller, this is what a more sophisticated pragmatist understands by the term meaning.

If we are to understand the pragmatic theory of meaning in Schiller's way, he is right to claim that James' theory of truth is a mere corollary of the pragmatist theory of meaning: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;But now, we may ask, how are these 'consequences' to test the 'truth' claimed by the assertion? Only by satisfying or thwarting that purpose, by forwarding or baffling that interest. If they do the one, the assertion is 'good' and [[pro tanto]] 'true' ; if they do the other, 'bad' and 'false'. Its 'consequences,' therefore, when investigated, always turn out to involve the 'practical' predicates 'good ' or 'bad,' and to contain a reference to ' practice' in the sense in which we have used that term. So soon as therefore we go beyond an abstract statement of the narrower pragmatism, and ask what in the concrete, and in actual knowing, 'having consequences ' may mean, we develop inevitably the fullblown pragmatism in the wider sense.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, F.C.S. (1905) pages 236–237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given Schiller's view that the meaning of a thought amounts to the consequences one means to bring about by the thought, Schiller further concluded that the truth of a thought depends on whether it actually brings about the consequences one intended. For example, if while following a cooking recipe that called for salt I were to think to myself, "Cerebos is salt", my thought will be true if it consequently leads me to add Cerebos and produce a dish with the intended taste. However, if while working in a chemistry lab to produce a certain mixture I were to think to myself, "Cerebos is salt", my thought would both have a different meaning than before (since my intent now differs) and be false (since Cerebos is only equivalent to salt for culinary purposes). According to Schiller, the question of what a thought like "Cerebos is salt" means or whether it is true can only be answered if the specific circumstances with which the thought arose are taken into consideration. While there is some similarity here between Schiller's view of meaning and the later [[Ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language philosophers]], Schiller's account ties meaning and truth more closely to individuals and their intent with a specific use rather than whole linguistic communities.

'''Georg Friedrich Daumer''' ([[Nuremberg]], 5 March 1800 - [[Würzburg]], 14 December 1875) was a [[Ethnic Germans|German]] poet and [[philosopher]]. He was educated at the gymnasium of his native city, at that time directed by the famous philosopher [[Hegel]]. In 1817 he entered the University of [[Erlangen]] as a student of theology, but abandoned that study for philosophy. For a number of years Daumer was professor at the gymnasium of Nuremberg; owing to ill-health he was pensioned in 1832 and henceforth devoted himself entirely to literary work. While at Erlangen he came strongly under the influence of [[Pietism]]. Soon, however, he became sceptical and exhibited decided leanings towards [[pantheism]]. From an orthodox Protestant he gradually became a bitter enemy of Christianity, which he attacked in a number of writings and for which he strove to substitute a new religion "of love and peace", formulated in his work ''Religion des neuen Weltalters'' (Hamburg, 1850). [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]] joined in writing a critical review of Daumer's ''Die Religion des Neuen Weltalters'' in January through February 1850 which was published in the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]: Politisch-Ökonomische Revue''.&lt;ref&gt;"Reviews from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Politisch-Ökonomische Revue No. 2" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10'', pp. 241-246.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx and Engels criticized Daumer's theory of history from class point of view.&lt;ref&gt;"Reviews from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politisch-Ökonomische Revue No. 2" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of a struggle between economic classes in society, Daumer saw only a struggle between "coarseness" and "culture."

Prior to writing ''Die Religion des Neuen Welalters'', Daumer had published a number of works, all of a distinctly anti-theological tendency, of which the more important are: ''Philosophie, Religion, und Altertum'' (Nuremberg, 1833); ''Züge zu einer neuen Philosophie der Religion und Religionsgeschichte'' (Nuremberg, 1835); ''Der Feuer- und Molochdienst der Hebräer'' (Brunswick, 1842); ''Die Geheimnisse des christlichen Altertums'' (Hamburg, 1847). Shortly after 1850 Daumer left Nuremberg and settled at [[Frankfurt]], where a great change soon came over him. In 1858 at [[Mainz]] he publicly embraced the Catholic faith and thenceforth became its zealous defender. Among the works written after his conversion are: ''Meine Konversion'' (Mainz, 1859); ''Aus der Mansarde'' (1860–62); ''Das Christentum und sein Urheber'' (Mainz, 1864); ''Das Wunder, seine Bedeutung, Wahrheit und Notwendigkeit'' (Ratisbon, 1874). The last mentioned work is directed expressly against the opinions of [[David Strauss]].

One of the most important parts of Daumer's work is his poetry. His ''Hafis'' (Hamburg, 1846; a second collection, 1852) contain graceful but very free imitations of the songs of the famous Persian poet. Some of them have become widely known through the musical settings of [[Brahms]], such as the ''[[Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52 (Brahms)|Liebeslieder]]'' and ''[[Neue Liebeslieder]]'' Waltzes. This collection, as well as ''Mahomed und sein Werk'' (Hamburg, 1848), is distinctly directed against the [[hypocrisy]] and [[asceticism]] which at that time Daumer believed to be inseparable from orthodox Christianity. Among other poems may be mentioned: ''Glorie der heiligen Jungfrau Maria'' (Nuremberg, 1841); ''Frauenbilder und Huldigungen'' (Leipzig, 1853); ''Marianische Legenden und Gedichte'' (Munster, 1859) and ''Schöne Seelen'' (Mainz, 1862).

Daumer was also known as host and teacher of the mysterious foundling [[Kaspar Hauser]] in 1828-30 and wrote several books about the case.

'''''Hatata''''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɑː|ˈ|t|ɑː|t|ə}}; [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]]: ሓተታ ''ḥatäta'' "inquiry") is a 1667 [[Ethics|ethical]] philosophical treatise by the Abyssinian philosopher [[Zera Yacob]], written at the request of his patron's son [[Walda Heywat]]. The philosophy is [[Theism|theistic]] in nature and came during a period when African philosophical literature was significantly oral in character. It has often been compared by scholars to [[Descartes]]' ''[[Discours de la methode]]'' (1637).

==Overview==
Yacob wrote ''Hatata'' as an investigation of the light of reason. Yacob is most noted for this philosophy surrounding the principle of harmony. He asserted that an action's [[morality]] is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world. While he did believe in a deity, whom he referred to as God, he rejected any set of religious beliefs. Rather than deriving beliefs from any organized religion, Yacob sought the truth in observing the natural world.

In ''Hatata'', in following in the footsteps of the Church fathers, Yacob applied the idea of the first cause to his proof for the existence of God. "If I say that my father and my mother created me, then I must search for the creator of my parents and of the parents of my parents until they arrive at the first who were not created as we [are] but who came into this world in some other way without being generated."

However, the knowability of God does not depend on human intellect, but "Our soul has the power of having the concept of God and of seeing him mentally. God did not give this power purposelessly; as he gave the power, so did he give the reality."{{Page needed|date=August 2011}}

Upon Yacob's death in 1692 his pupil Walda Heywat updated the work to include his death.

'''Henry James Sr.''' (June 3, 1811 in [[Albany, New York]]{{spaced ndash}}December 18, 1882 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]) was an American theologian and adherent of [[The New Church|Swedenborgianism]], also known for being the father of the philosopher [[William James]], novelist [[Henry James]], and diarist [[Alice James]].

==Early life==
James was born on June 3, 1811 in [[Albany, New York]].  He was one of twelve children born to Catharine ([[née]] Barbara) James and William James (1771–1832), an emigrant from [[Bailieborough]], [[County Cavan]], Ireland to the United States around 1789, who amassed a fortune of about $1.2 million from business dealings in upstate [[New York (state)|New York State]], primarily in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] real estate, money lending, and his involvement with the building of the [[Erie Canal]].

At the age of thirteen, he was severely burned trying to stamp out a fire in a barn, and lost a leg to amputation.  The three years he was bedridden reinforced his studious disposition.  He entered [[Union College]] in 1828 and graduated in 1830.  His father, a stern [[Presbyterian]], disapproved of his religious ideas, but when the patriarch's [[will (law)|will]] was broken, he became an independently wealthy man.  He studied at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] from 1835 to 1837 to prepare for the ministry, but found himself disconcerted by "enormous difficulties which inhered in its philosophy," and abandoned the idea of becoming a minister.  After Princeton, James then went to England for about a year, and returned in 1838 to New York.

==Career==
Upon James' return to New York in 1838, he prepared an edition of [[Robert Sandeman (theologian)|Robert Sandeman]]'s ''Letters on Theron and Aspasio'', which has been called the principal literary document of a Scottish [[sect]] that opposed the [[Presbyterian]] Church.  In his preface to Sandeman's work, he called it "a far more faithful exhibition of [[Gospel]] truth than any other work."   What specifically interested James was its radically [[egalitarian]] message.  Sandeman wrote: "In fine, the whole [[New Testament]] speaks aloud, that as to the matter of acceptance with God, there is no difference betwixt one man and another; — no difference betwixt the best accomplished gentleman, and the most infamous scoundrel; — no difference betwixt the most virtuous lady and the vilest prostitute ..."

===Swedenborgianism===
Around 1841, James began to be interested in [[Swedenborgianism]] when he read some articles in London's ''[[Monthly Magazine]]'' on the subject by [[J.J. Garth Wilkinson]], who would become one of James's closest friends.  In his quest, he met and befriended [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], but did not find much satisfaction in Emerson's thought.  Emerson introduced James to [[Thomas Carlyle]].  But it was in the work of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772), the Swedish scientist, religious visionary and teacher,  that James found a spiritual home.  In May 1844, while living in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], in England, James was sitting alone one evening at the family dinner table after the meal, gazing at the fire, when he had the defining spiritual experience of his life, which he would come to interpret as a Swedenborgian "vastation," a stage in the process of spiritual regeneration.  This experience was an apprehension of, in his own words, "a perfectly insane and abject terror, without ostensible cause, and only to be accounted for, to my perplexed imagination, by some damned shape squatting invisible to me within the precincts of the room, and raying out from his fetid personality influences fatal to life." &lt;ref&gt;quoted in F.W. Dupee, "Henry James," Sloan, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

James's "vastation" initiated a spiritual crisis that lasted two years, and was finally resolved through the thorough exploration of the work of Swedenborg and [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]].  James became convinced that, as he put it, "the curse of mankind, that which keeps our manhood so little and so depraved, is its sense of [[self (philosophy)|self]]hood, and the absurd abominable opinionativeness it engenders."  He remained attached to Swedenborg's thought for the rest of life, and never traveled without carrying Swedenborg's works with him.

In 1845, James again returned to the United States and began a lifetime of lecturing about his spiritual discoveries.  He devoted his mornings to writing, and published a number of discursive volumes devoted to the exposition of his thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The philosophy of Henry James, Sr. - Princeton University Library Catalog|url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/1555240|website=catalog.princeton.edu|accessdate=25 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social thought===
In the late 1840s, James became interested in the former members of [[Brook Farm]], an experiment in communal living at [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]] that lasted from 1841 to 1847, and in Fourierism, the school of utopian [[socialism]] that grew out of the thought of French social philosopher [[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837) and which was a major influence in the last several years of Brook Farm.  James was interested in [[utopia]]nism as a stepping stone to the spiritual life.  In his view, man is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;under a threefold subjection, first to [[nature]], then to society, and finally to God.  His appetites and his sensuous understanding relate him to society or his fellow man; and his ideas relate him to God. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. He who obeys his appetites merely finds himself speedily betrayed by the inflexible laws of nature to disease and death.  He who obeys his passions merely binds himself by the inflexible laws of society to shame and seclusion.  But he who obeys his ideas, he who gives himself up to the guidance of infinite [[goodness and value theory|good]]ness, [[truth]], and beauty, encounters no limitation at the hands either of nature or society, and, instead of disease and shame, plucks only the fruits of health and immortal honor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James was a stern critic of the "gross materiality" of American society, and found in Fourier's thought a useful critique.  He held most of the leading writers of his day in low regard, with the possible exception of [[Walt Whitman]], though he met and cultivated many of them, including Emerson, [[Bronson Alcott]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].

James was an advocate of many social reforms, including the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of [[slavery]] and the liberalization of divorce.

===Theology===
Theologically, James was out of sympathy with the [[Philosophical naturalism|naturalism]] of much of the religious thought of the nineteenth century.  He regarded creation itself as "a purely spiritual process, falling wholly within the realm of affection and thought."  The fundamental theological problem, in his view, is [[theodicy]], or the problem of [[evil]].  His Swedenborgian solution to the problem of evil relied on breaking the bond between God and [[nature]], or, put alternatively, between nature and reality.  True reality (or God) is, in James's view, thoroughly spiritual, in a way that denizens of the natural world can scarcely comprehend.  But through intuition of this true reality, James thought, liberation from the illusions of natural appearances—which include time, [[space]], and [[self (philosophy)|self]]hood—is possible.  In such liberation lies [[salvation]], in James's view, whereas [[evil]]—more specifically, ''spiritual'' evil, since James distinguishes this from "physical" and "moral" evil—arises from action based on the delusion of selfhood.  In James's thought, "the principle of [[hell]] is selfhood and the principle of [[heaven]] is brotherly love," as [[C. Hartley Grattan]] puts it in ''The Three James: A Family of Minds: Henry James Sr., William James, Henry James'' (N.Y. Univ. Press, 1962 [orig. ed. 1932], p.&amp;nbsp;75).  But James was not a slavish follower of Swedenborg.  Rather, it was in Swedenborg that he found the most fecund exploration of his central insight that the source of all evil was in attachment to the self.

===Later years===
Although the ideas of James were received by his contemporaries with little enthusiasm, and although he was altogether out of sympathy with his age's enthusiasm for science, he never grew discouraged; in fact, some of the best expositions of his thought are to be found in the volumes of his later years.  He participated actively in the lives of his children, whose education he had done so much to shape.  His society was cultivated by many, who enjoyed his conversation—provided that they were strong enough to bear the sometimes devastating criticism he offered.  He delighted in [[paradox]] and exaggeration and enjoyed flouting convention.  But he shunned formal society, which he found uncongenial.  He wrote:  "The bent of my nature is towards affection and thought rather than action.  I love the fireside rather than the forum."

===Legacy===
[[Thoreau]]'s description of an encounter with James gives an idea of how his contemporaries saw and judged him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I met Henry James the other night at [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]'s, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, [[Amos Bronson Alcott|Alcott]] did not talk much, being disturbed by James's opposition.  The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both on account of his doctrines and his good temper.  He utters ''quasi''-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude.  He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it.  But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now.  For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on [[Thanksgiving Day]] that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born.  But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it.  There is Dobson over the hill.  Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times.  This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies.  We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more.  But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction.  You and I are Dobson; what will James do for us?.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in ''The Three James'', p. 84 and in Ralph Barton Perry, ''The Thought and Character of William James'' [Boston: Little, Brown, 1936], vol. 1, pp. 149-50&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

James's marriage was a happy one, and when Mary James died on January 29, 1882, his will to live seemed to die with her.  His work on yet another volume flagged, and he fell into a state of indolence.  He rallied briefly after visits from his sons, called to his side by his daughter, Alice.  But he suffered a relapse after Henry Jr. and William left on excursions to Europe.  His famous sons never saw him alive again.  He died on December 18, 1882, at his residence on [[List of addresses in Beacon Hill, Boston|Vernon Street]] in Boston.&lt;ref name="HJObit1882"&gt;{{cite news|title=HENRY JAMES DEAD {{!}} Peaceful and Happy End of the Celebrated Writer|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/179489794/?terms=henry%2Bjames|accessdate=25 April 2018|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=20 Dec 1882|page=4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CTObit1882"&gt;{{cite news|title=OBITUARY.

On the same day, his son [[Henry James|Henry]]'s boat docked in New York on his way back to see his father.  [[William James]], in London at the time, was kept from full knowledge of his father's decline in order not to interfere with a much needed vacation; when he learned that his father was on his deathbed, four days before his final demise, William James wrote a moving letter that his father never read.  In it, the famous psychologist wrote:  "In that mysterious gulf of the past into which the present will soon fall and go back and back, yours is still for me the central figure.  All my intellectual life I derive from you; and though we have often seemed at odds in the expression thereof I'm sure there's a harmony somewhere, &amp; that our strivings will combine.  What my debt to you is goes beyond all my power of estimating,—so early, so penetrating and so constant has been the influence. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Good night my sacred old Father.  If I don't see you again—Farewell! a blessed farewell!".&lt;ref&gt;''Correspondence of William James'', vol. 5: ''1878-1884'', edited by Ignas K. Skrupskelis &amp; Elizabeth M.

'''Innatism''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] doctrine that holds that the mind is born with ideas/knowledge, and that therefore the mind is not a "[[blank slate]]" at birth, as early [[Empiricism|empiricists]] such as [[John Locke]] claimed. It asserts that not all knowledge is gained from experience and the [[senses]]. [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] are prominent philosophers in the development of innatism and the notion that the mind is already born with ideas, knowledge and beliefs.&lt;ref name=:Schmaltz/&gt; Both philosophers emphasize that experiences are the key to unlocking this knowledge but not the source of the knowledge itself. Essentially, no knowledge is derived exclusively from one's experiences as empiricists like John Locke suggested.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Stich, S. P. (1975). ''Innate ideas''. Berkley, CA: University of California Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference from nativism ==

In general usage, the terms ''innatism'' and ''nativism'' are synonymous as they both refer to notions of preexisting ideas present in the mind. However, more correctly,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} innatism refers to the philosophy of [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]], who assumed that a God or a similar being or process placed innate ideas and principles in the human mind.&lt;ref name=:Schmaltz&gt;Tad M. Schmaltz, ''Radical Cartesianism: The French Reception of Descartes'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativism represents an adaptation of this, grounded in the fields of [[genetics]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[psycholinguistics]]. Nativists hold that innate beliefs are in some way genetically programmed to arise in our mind&amp;mdash;that innate beliefs are the [[phenotypes]] of certain [[genotypes]] that all humans share in common.

== Nativism ==

{{main|Psychological nativism}}

Nativism is a modern view rooted in innatism. The advocates of nativism are mainly philosophers who also work in the field of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[psycholinguistics]]: most notably [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jerry Fodor]] (although the latter has adopted a more critical attitude towards nativism in his later writings). The nativist's general objection against [[empiricism]] is still the same as was raised by the [[Rationalism|rationalists]]; the human mind of a newborn child is not a [[tabula rasa]], but equipped with an inborn structure.

== Innate idea ==

In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], an '''innate idea''' is a [[concept]] or item of [[knowledge]] which is said to be ''[[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] to all [[human race|humanity]]''—that is, something people are born with rather than something people have ''learned'' through experience.

The issue is controversial, and can be said to be an aspect of a long-running [[nature versus nurture]] debate, albeit one localized to the question of understanding human [[cognition]].

=== Philosophical debate ===

Although individual human beings obviously vary due to cultural, racial, linguistic and era-specific influences, innate ideas are said to belong to a more fundamental level of human cognition. For example, the philosopher [[René Descartes]] theorized that knowledge of [[God]] is innate in everybody as a product of the faculty of faith.

Other philosophers, most notably the [[Empiricism|empiricists]], were critical of the theory and denied the existence of any innate ideas, saying all human knowledge was founded on experience, rather than ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning.

Philosophically, the debate over innate ideas is central to the conflict between [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Empiricism|empiricist]] [[Epistemology|epistemologies]]. While rationalists believe that certain ideas exist independently of experience, empiricism claims that all knowledge is derived from experience.

[[Immanuel Kant]] was a German philosopher who is regarded as having ended the impasse in modern philosophy between rationalists and empiricists, and is widely held to have synthesized these two early modern traditions in his thought.

==== Plato ====
[[Plato]] argues that if there are certain concepts that we know to be true but did not learn from experience then it must be because we have an innate knowledge of it and this knowledge must have been gained before birth. In Plato's ''[[Meno]]'', he recalls a situation in which [[Socrates]], his mentor, questioned a slave boy about a geometry theorem. Though the slave boy had no previous experience with geometry, he was able to generate the right responses to the questions he was asked. Plato reasoned that this was possible as Socrates' questions sparked the innate knowledge of math the boy had had from birth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacewing, M. (n.d.). Innate knowledge''. Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/AS/ReasonandExperience/Innate-knowledge.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Descartes ====
[[Descartes]] conveys the idea that innate knowledge or ideas is something inborn such as one would say, that a certain disease might be 'innate' to signify that a person might be at risk of contacting such a disease. He suggests that something that is 'innate' is effectively present from birth and while it may not reveal itself then, is more than likely to present itself later in life. Descartes comparison of innate knowledge to an innate disease, whose symptoms may only show up later in life, unless prohibited by a factor like age or puberty, suggests that if an event occurs prohibiting someone from exhibiting an innate behaviour or knowledge, it doesn’t mean the knowledge did not exist at all but rather it wasn’t expressed – they were not able to acquire that knowledge. In other words, innate beliefs, ideas and knowledge require experiences to be triggered or they may never be expressed. Experiences are not the source of knowledge as proposed by John Locke, but catalysts to the uncovering of knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== John Locke ====
The main antagonist to the concept of innate ideas is [[John Locke]], a contemporary of Leibniz. Locke argued that the mind is in fact devoid of all knowledge or ideas at birth; it is a blank sheet or ''tabula rasa''. He argued that all our ideas are constructed in the mind via a process of constant composition and decomposition of the input that we receive through our senses.

Locke, in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', suggests that the concept of universal assent in fact proves nothing, except perhaps that everyone is in agreement; in short universal assent proves that there is universal assent and nothing else. Moreover, Locke goes on to suggest that in fact there ''is'' no universal assent. Even a phrase such as "What is, is" is not universally assented to; infants and severely handicapped adults do not generally acknowledge this [[truism]]. Locke also attacks the idea that an innate idea can be imprinted on the mind without the owner realizing it. For Locke, such reasoning would allow one to conclude the absurd: “all the Truths a Man ever comes to know, will, by this account, be, every one of them, innate.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0sdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=%22%E2%80%9Call+the+Truths+a+Man+ever+comes+to+know,+will,+by+this+account,+be,+every+one+of+them,+innate%E2%80%9D+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DVgzhSVEu8&amp;sig=MufLd5R0cx-LNt3Xf3CwjrJApkI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjb27iUxpDdAhUOEawKHWYVCLkQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%E2%80%9Call%20the%20Truths%20a%20Man%20ever%20comes%20to%20know,%20will,%20by%20this%20account,%20be,%20every%20one%20of%20them,%20innate%E2%80%9D%20%22&amp;f=false|title=An essay concerning human understanding: and a treatise on the conduct of the understanding. Complete in one volume with the author's last additions and corrections|last=Locke|first=John|date=1860|publisher=Hayes &amp; Zell|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To return to the musical analogy, we may not be able to recall the entire melody until we hear the first few notes, but we were aware of the fact that we knew the melody and that upon hearing the first few notes we would be able to recall the rest.

Locke ends his attack upon innate ideas by suggesting that the mind is a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' or "blank slate", and that all ideas come from experience; all our knowledge is founded in sensory experience.

Essentially, the same knowledge thought to be ''a priori'' by Leibniz is in fact, according to Locke, the result of empirical knowledge, which has a lost origin [been forgotten] in respect to the inquirer. However, the inquirer is not cognizant of this fact; thus, he experiences what he believes to be ''a priori'' knowledge.

1) The theory of innate knowledge is excessive. Even innatists accept that most of our knowledge is learned through experience, but if that can be extended to account for all knowledge, we learn colour through seeing it, so therefore, there is no need for a theory about an innate understanding of colour.

2) No ideas are universally held. Do we all possess the idea of God? Do we all believe in justice and beauty? Do we all understand the law of identity? If not, it may not be the case that we have acquired these ideas through impressions/experience/social interaction (this is the children's and idiot's criticism).

3) Even if there are some universally agreed statements, it is just the ability of the human brain to organize learned ideas/words, that is, innate. An "ability to organize"  is not the same as "possessing propositional knowledge" (e.g., a computer with no saved files has all the operations programmed in but has an empty memory).

==== Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ====
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] suggested that we are born with certain innate ideas, the most identifiable of these being mathematical [[truism]]s. The idea that ''1 + 1 = 2'' is evident to us without the necessity for [[empirical evidence]]. Leibniz argues that empiricism can only show us that concepts are true in the present; the observation of one apple and then another in one instance, and in that instance only, leads to the conclusion that one and another equals two. However, the suggestion that one and another will always equal two require an innate idea, as that would be a suggestion of things unwitnessed.

Leibniz called such concepts as mathematical truisms "necessary truths". Another example of such may be the phrase, "what is, is" or "it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be". Leibniz argues that such [[truism]]s are universally assented to (acknowledged by all to be true); this being the case, it must be due to their status as innate ideas. Often there are ideas that are acknowledged as necessarily true but are not universally assented to. Leibniz would suggest that this is simply because the person in question has not become aware of the innate idea, not because they do not possess it. Leibniz argues that empirical evidence can serve to bring to the surface certain principles that are already innately embedded in our minds. This is similar to needing to hear only the first few notes in order to recall the rest of the melody.

=== Scientific ideas ===

In his ''[[Meno]]'', Plato raises an important epistemological quandary: How is it that we have certain ideas which are not conclusively derivable from our environments? [[Noam Chomsky]] has taken this problem as a philosophical framework for the scientific enquiry into innatism. His linguistic theory, which derives from 18th century [[Classical liberalism|classical-liberal]] thinkers such as [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], attempts to explain in cognitive terms how we can develop knowledge of systems which are said, by supporters of innatism, to be too rich and complex to be derived from our environment. One such example is our linguistic faculty. Our linguistic systems contain a systemic complexity which supposedly could not be empirically derived: the environment seems too poor, variable and indeterminate, according to Chomsky, to explain the extraordinary ability to learn complex concepts possessed by very young children. Essentially, their accurate grammatical knowledge cannot have originated from their experiences as their experiences are not adequate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It follows that humans must be born with a universal innate grammar, which is determinate and has a highly organized directive component, and enables the language learner to ascertain and categorize language heard into a system. Chomsky states that the ability to learn how to properly construct sentences or know which sentences are grammatically incorrect is an ability gained from innate knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Noam Chomsky cites as evidence for this theory, the apparent invariability, according to his views, of human languages at a fundamental level. In this way, linguistics may provide a window into the human mind, and establish scientific theories of innateness which otherwise would remain merely speculative.

One implication of Noam Chomsky's innatism, if correct, is that at least a part of human knowledge consists in cognitive predispositions, which are triggered and developed by the environment, but not determined by it. Chomsky suggests that we can look at how a belief is acquired as an input-output situation. He supports the doctrine of innatism as he states that human beliefs gathered from sensory experience are much richer and complex than the experience itself. He asserts that the extra information gathered is from the mind itself as it cannot solely be from  experiences. Humans derive excess amount of information from their environment so some of that information must be pre-determined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Parallels can then be drawn, on a purely speculative level, between our moral faculties and language, as has been done by sociobiologists such as [[E. O. Wilson]] and evolutionary psychologists such as [[Steven Pinker]]. The relative consistency of fundamental notions of morality across cultures seems to produce convincing evidence for these theories. In psychology, notions of [[archetypes]] such as those developed by [[Carl Jung]], suggest determinate identity perceptions.

=== Scientific evidence for innateness ===
Evidence for innatism is being found by neuroscientists working on the [[Blue Brain Project]]. They discovered that [[neuron]]s transmit signals despite an individual's experience. It had been previously assumed that neuronal circuits are made when the experience of an individual is imprinted in the brain, making memories. Researchers at Blue Brain discovered a network of about fifty neurons which they believed were building blocks of more complex knowledge but contained basic innate knowledge that could be combined in different more complex ways to give way to acquired knowledge, like memory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Pousaz, L. (2011, March 22). ''New evidence for innate knowledge''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://actu.epfl.ch/news/new-evidence-for-innate-knowledge-5/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists ran tests on the neuronal circuits of several rats and ascertained that if the neuronal circuits had only been formed based on an individual's experience, the tests would bring about very different characteristics for each rat. However, the rats all displayed similar characteristics which suggests that their neuronal circuits must have been established previously to their experiences – it must be inborn and created prior to their experiences. The research done in the Blue Brain project expresses that some the building blocks of all our knowledge, is genetic and we're born with it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Learning vs. innate knowledge ==

There are two ways in which animals can gain knowledge. The first of these two ways is learning. This is when an animal gathers information about its surrounding environment and then proceeds to use this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it has learned not to eat this again. The second way that an animal can acquire knowledge is through innate knowledge. This knowledge is genetically inherited. The animal automatically knows it without any prior experience. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila&gt;[http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |date=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenarios, innate knowledge is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true.

=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge and the evolution of learning ===

In a changing environment, an animal must constantly be gaining new information in order to survive. However, in a stable environment this same individual need only to gather the information it needs once and rely on it for the duration of its life. Therefore, there are different scenarios in which learning or innate knowledge is better suited.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of having it determined whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighed the benefit of having it, then the individual would not have evolved to learn in this scenario; instead, non-learning would evolve. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighed the cost of obtaining it, then the animal would be far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila/&gt;

Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs then learning would simply be unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario – and because learning could prove to be disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information – non-learning evolves.  However, if an environment were in a constant state of change then learning would also prove to be disadvantageous. Anything learned would immediately become irrelevant because of the changing environment.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila/&gt; The learned information would no longer apply. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning would evolve.

However, in environments where change occurs but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing and adapts to changes in the environment as opposed to innate knowledge.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila/&gt;

An '''interpretation of quantum mechanics''' is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of [[quantum mechanics]] corresponds to [[reality]]. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments, there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation.  These views differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is [[determinism|deterministic]] or random, which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered "real", and what is the nature of measurement, among other matters.

Despite nearly a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached amongst physicists and [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] concerning which interpretation best represents reality.

The definition of quantum theorists' terms, such as ''[[wave function]]s'' and ''[[matrix mechanics]]'', progressed through many stages. For instance, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] originally viewed the electron's wave function as its charge density smeared across the [[field (physics)#Waves as fields|field]], whereas [[Max Born]] reinterpreted the absolute square value of the wave function as the electron's [[probability density function|probability density]] distributed across the field.

Although the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] was originally most popular, [[quantum decoherence]] has gained popularity.  Thus the [[many-worlds interpretation]] has been gaining acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidman, L. (2002, March 24). Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.

As a rough guide development of the mainstream view during the 1990s to 2000s, consider the "snapshot" of opinions collected in a  poll by Schlosshauer et al. at the 2011 "Quantum  Physics  and  the  Nature  of  Reality" conference of July 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=1301.1069

The authors reference a similarly informal poll carried out by [[Max Tegmark]] at the "Fundamental  Problems in Quantum Theory" conference in August 1997. The main conclusion of the authors is that "the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:
:"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll."

It is noteworthy that only Cramer's [[transactional interpretation]], published in 1986, assigns physical basis to [[Max Born]]'s assertion that the absolute square of the wave function is a probability density.&lt;ref&gt;The Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, R.E.Kastner, Cambridge University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-521-76415-5}}, p35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature ==
More or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:
# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''—a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions
# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''—a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world
Two qualities vary among interpretations:
# [[Ontology]]—claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world
# [[Epistemology]]—claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world

In [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually "governs" outcomes—and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism—is a [[category mistake]].

In a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]—approximately true description or explanation of the natural world—or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.

{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], "Shut up and calculate", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase "shut up and calculate", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could feynman have said this?|journal=Physics Today|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N. David|bibcode=2004PhT....57e..10M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches to resolve conceptual problems introduce new mathematical formalism, and so propose alternative theories with their interpretations.  An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms—[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]]'s [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]—has been demonstrated.

== Challenges ==

# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.
# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. 
# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Bacciagaluppi, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].&lt;ref&gt;''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see "[[Quantum logic]]").  Like contextuality, the "origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators" that describe quantum objects (Omnès 1999).
# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.
# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibnitz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.

== Summaries ==

=== Classification adopted by Einstein ===
An interpretation (i.e. a [[semantics|semantic explanation]] of the formal mathematics of quantum mechanics) can be characterized by its treatment of certain matters addressed by Einstein, such as:
* Realism
* Completeness
* [[Principle of locality#Local realism|Local realism]]
* [[Determinism]]

To explain these properties, we need to be more explicit about the kind of picture an interpretation provides. To that end we will regard an interpretation as a correspondence between the elements of the mathematical formalism '''M''' and the elements of an interpreting structure '''I''', where:
* The ''mathematical formalism'' '''M''' consists of the Hilbert space machinery of [[bra–ket notation|ket-vectors]], [[self-adjoint operator]]s acting on the space of ket-vectors, unitary time dependence of the ket-vectors, and measurement operations. In this context a measurement operation is a transformation which turns a ket-vector into a probability distribution (for a formalization of this concept see [[quantum operation]]s).
* The ''interpreting structure'' '''I''' includes states, transitions between states, measurement operations, and possibly information about spatial extension of these elements. A measurement operation refers to an operation which returns a value and might result in a system state change. Spatial information would be exhibited by states represented as functions on configuration space. The transitions may be [[Quantum indeterminacy|non-deterministic]] or probabilistic or there may be infinitely many states.

The crucial aspect of an interpretation is whether the elements of '''I''' are regarded as physically real. Hence the bare instrumentalist view of quantum mechanics outlined in the previous section is not an interpretation at all, for it makes no claims about elements of physical reality.

The current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = [[EPR paradox|Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?]] | url = | journal = Phys. Rev. | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 777–780 | doi=10.1103/physrev.47.777| bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that paper the authors proposed the concepts ''element of reality'' and the ''completeness of a physical theory''. They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.

Determinism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.

Local realism has two aspects:
* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;
* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.

A precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].

[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].

It should be noted that regardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.

=== Copenhagen interpretation ===
{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}

The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the "standard" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like "where was the particle before I measured its position?" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], "reality is in the observations, not in the electron".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.

=== Many worlds ===
{{Main|Many-worlds interpretation}}

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a [[universal wavefunction]] obeys the same deterministic, [[CPT symmetry|reversible]] laws at all times; in particular there is no (indeterministic and [[irreversibility|irreversible]]) [[wavefunction collapse]] associated with measurement. The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly "splitting" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories—effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].

=== Consistent histories ===
{{Main|Consistent histories}}

The [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schrödinger equation]].

According to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).

=== Ensemble interpretation ===
{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}

The [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles. Probably the most notable supporter of such an interpretation was Einstein:

{{Quote|The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which become immediately unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems.|Einstein in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist'', ed. P.A. Schilpp (Harper &amp; Row, New York)}}

The most prominent current advocate of the ensemble interpretation is Leslie E. Ballentine, professor at [[Simon Fraser University]], author of the graduate level text book ''Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development''. An experiment illustrating the ensemble interpretation is provided in Akira Tonomura's Video clip 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A new version of the ensemble interpretation that relies on a reformulation of probability theory was introduced by Raed Shaiia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oalib.com/index/3138961#.V2dVs9J94dU|title=On the Measurement Problem|first=Raed M.|last=Shaiia|date=9 February 2015|publisher=|doi=10.5923/j.ijtmp.20140405.04|volume=4|journal=International Journal of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics|pages=202–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/physicsraedshaiia/publications&lt;/ref&gt;

=== De Broglie–Bohm theory ===
{{Main|De Broglie–Bohm theory}}

The [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]] of quantum mechanics (also known as the pilot wave theory) is a theory by [[Louis de Broglie]] and extended later by [[David Bohm]] to include measurements.  Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schrödinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Action at a distance (physics)|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality. The [[measurement problem]] is resolved, since the particles have definite positions at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maudlin | first1 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Why Bohm's Theory Solves the Measurement Problem | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 479–483 | doi=10.1086/289879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collapse is explained as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]].&lt;ref name="CushingFine2013"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Durr |first1=D. |last2=Zanghi |first2=N. |last3=Goldstein |first3=S.|arxiv=quant-ph/9511016 |title=''Bohmian Mechanics as the Foundation of Quantum Mechanics ''|date=Nov 14, 1995 }} Also published in {{cite book|author1=J.T.

=== Relational quantum mechanics ===
{{Main|Relational quantum mechanics}}
The essential idea behind [[relational quantum mechanics]], following the precedent of [[special relativity]], is that different observers may give different accounts of the same series of events: for example, to one observer at a given point in time, a system may be in a single, "collapsed" [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstate]], while to another observer at the same time, it may be in a superposition of two or more states.  Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of "state" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any "measurement event" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector.

=== Transactional interpretation ===
{{Main|Transactional interpretation}}
The [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics (TIQM) by [[John G. Cramer]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function). Since the possibility wave is collapsed by interaction with the receiver, consciousness plays no role in the theory, eliminating [[Schrödinger's cat]] paradox.  This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.

=== Stochastic mechanics ===
{{Main|Stochastic interpretation}}
An entirely classical derivation and interpretation of Schrödinger's wave equation by analogy with [[Brownian motion]] was suggested by [[Princeton University]] professor [[Edward Nelson]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = E | year = 1966 | title = Derivation of the Schrödinger Equation from Newtonian Mechanics | url = | journal = Phys.

Fürth (1933), [[I. Fényes]] (1952), and [[Walter Weizel]] (1953), and are referenced in Nelson's paper. More recent work on the stochastic interpretation has been done by M. Pavon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pavon | first1 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Stochastic mechanics and the Feynman integral | url = | journal = J. Math.

=== Objective collapse theories ===
{{Main|Objective collapse theory}}
Objective collapse theories differ from the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] by regarding both the wave function and the process of collapse as ontologically objective (meaning these exist and occur independent of the observer).  In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly ("spontaneous localization") or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role.  Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension to QM means that objective collapse is more of a theory than an interpretation.  Examples include 
* the [[Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Consciousness causes collapse (von Neumann–Wigner interpretation) ===
{{Main|Consciousness causes collapse}}
In his treatise ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] deeply analyzed the so-called [[measurement problem]]. He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the Schrödinger equation (the universal wave function). He also described how measurement could cause a collapse of the wave function.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John. (1932/1955). ''Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. Translated by Robert T. Beyer.&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view was prominently expanded on by [[Eugene Wigner]], who argued that human experimenter consciousness (or maybe even dog consciousness) was critical for the collapse, but he later abandoned this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[Michael Esfeld, (1999), "Essay Review: Wigner's View of Physical Reality", published in ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', 30B, pp. 145–154, Elsevier Science Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/9501014|author1=Zvi Schreiber|title=The Nine Lives of Schrödinger's Cat|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of the consciousness causes collapse interpretation include:

: '''Subjective reduction research'''
::This principle, that consciousness causes the collapse, is the point of intersection between quantum mechanics and the mind/body problem; and researchers are working to detect conscious events correlated with physical events that, according to quantum theory, should involve a wave function collapse; but, thus far, results are inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Dick J. Bierman and Stephen Whitmarsh. (2006). ''Consciousness and Quantum Physics: Empirical Research on the Subjective Reduction of the State Vector''. in Jack A. Tuszynski (Ed).

=== Many minds ===
{{Main|Many-minds interpretation}}

The many-minds interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]] extends the [[many-worlds interpretation]] by proposing that the distinction between worlds should be made at the level of the mind of an individual observer.

=== Quantum logic ===
{{Main|Quantum logic}}

[[Quantum logic]] can be regarded as a kind of propositional logic suitable for understanding the apparent anomalies regarding quantum measurement, most notably those concerning composition of measurement operations of complementary variables. This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.

Cit.: "Let us call the thought that information might be the basic category from which all else flows informational immaterialism."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interpretations where quantum mechanics is said to describe an observer's knowledge of the world, rather than the world itself.

''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 19(7):8–14.)&lt;/ref&gt; Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to [[instrumentalism]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to "become entangled" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.

Not all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, highlights how well the two-state vector formalism dovetails with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''. In: Juan Gonzalo Muga, Rafael Sala Mayato, Íñigo Egusquiza (eds.): ''Time in Quantum Mechanics'', Volume 1, Lecture Notes in Physics 734, pp.&amp;nbsp;399–447, 2nd ed., Springer, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-540-73472-7}}, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-540-73473-4_13}}, {{arXiv|quant-ph/0105101}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=InKru6zHQWgC&amp;pg=PA443 p. 443]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Branching space-time theories ===
BST theories resemble the many worlds interpretation; however, "the main difference is that the BST interpretation takes the branching of history to be a feature of the topology of the set of events with their causal relationships... rather than a consequence of the separate evolution of different components of a state vector."&lt;ref name="Sharlow" /&gt; In MWI, it is the wave functions that branches, whereas in BST, the space-time topology itself branches.
BST  has applications to Bell's theorem, quantum computation and quantum gravity. It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.&lt;ref name="Sharlow"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; "What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics"] p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other interpretations ===
{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}
As well as the mainstream interpretations discussed above, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].

== Comparison ==
The most common interpretations are summarized in the table below. The values shown in the cells of the table are not without controversy, for the precise meanings of some of the concepts involved are unclear and, in fact, are themselves at the center of the controversy surrounding the given interpretation. For another table comparing interpretations of quantum theory, see reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.04711.pdf|title=What is quantum information?|last=Olimpia,|first=Lombardi,|last2=1979-|first2=Fortin, Sebastian,|last3=Federico,|first3=Holik,|last4=Cristian,|first4=López,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781107142114|location=|pages=|oclc=965759965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No experimental evidence exists that distinguishes among these interpretations. To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to "interpret" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.

Most of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued about by many people.

* {{note label|note1|1}} According to Bohr, the concept of a physical state independent of the conditions of its experimental observation does not have a well-defined meaning. According to Heisenberg the wavefunction represents a probability, but not an objective reality itself in space and time.
* {{note label|note2|2}} According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the wavefunction collapses when a measurement is performed.
* {{note label|note3|3}} Both particle &lt;small&gt;AND&lt;/small&gt; guiding wavefunction are real.
* {{note label|note4|4}} Unique particle history, but multiple wave histories.
* {{note label|note5|5}} But quantum logic is more limited in applicability than Coherent Histories.
* {{note label|note6|6}} Quantum mechanics is regarded as a way of predicting observations, or a theory of measurement.
*  {{note label|note7|7}} Observers separate the universal wavefunction into orthogonal sets of experiences.
* {{note label|note8|8}} In the TI the collapse of the state vector is interpreted as the completion of the transaction between emitter and absorber.
* {{note label|note9|9}} Comparing histories between systems in this interpretation has no well-defined meaning.
* {{note label|note10|10}} Any physical interaction is treated as a collapse event relative to the systems involved, not just macroscopic or conscious observers.
* {{note label|note11|11}} The state of the system is observer-dependent, i.e., the state is specific to the reference frame of the observer.
* {{note label|note12|12}} The transactional interpretation is explicitly non-local.
* {{note label|note13|13}} The assumption of intrinsic periodicity is an element of non-locality consistent  with relativity as the periodicity varies in a causal way.
* {{note label|note14|14}} In the stochastic interpretation is not possible to define velocities for particles, i.e. the paths are not smooth. Moreover, to know the motion of the particles at any moment, you have to know what the Markov process is. However, once we know the exactly initial conditions and the Markov process, the theory is in fact a realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics.
* {{note label|note15|15}} The kind of non-locality required by the theory, sufficient to violate the Bell inequalities, is weaker than that assumed in EPR. In particular, this kind non-locality is compatible with no signaling theorem and Lorentz invariance.
* {{note label|note16|16}} A wavefunction merely encodes an agent’s expectations for future experiences. It is no more real than a probability distribution is in [[Bayesian probability#Dutch book approach|subjective Bayesianism]].
* {{note label|note17|17}} Quantum theory is a tool any agent may use to help manage their expectations. The past comes into play only insofar as an agent’s individual experiences and temperament influence their priors.
* {{note label|note18|18}} Although QBism would eschew this terminology. A change in the wavefunction that an agent ascribes to a system as a result of having an experience represents a change in his or her beliefs about further experiences they may have. See [[Doxastic logic]]. 
* {{note label|note19|19}} Observers, or more properly, participants, are as essential to the formalism as the systems they interact with.

'''Isma'il Raji al-Faruqi''' ({{lang-ar|إسماعيل راجي الفاروقي}} January 1, 1921 – May 27, 1986), was a  [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]]-[[United States|American]] philosopher, widely recognised by his peers as an authority on [[Islam]] and [[comparative religion]]. He spent several years at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], then taught at several universities in North America, including [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]]. He was Professor of Religion at [[Temple University]], where he founded and chaired the [[Islamic Studies]] program. Al-Faruqi was also the founder of the [[International Institute of Islamic Thought]]. He wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being ''Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas''. He also established the Islamic Studies Group of the American Academy of Religion and chaired it for ten years. He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloquium, The Muslim-Jewish-Christian Conference and as the president of the American Islamic College in Chicago.

Al-Faruqi and his wife, [[Lois Lamya al-Faruqi]], were stabbed to death in their home in [[Wyncote, Pennsylvania|Wyncote]], [[Pennsylvania]] on May 27, 1986.

==Early life and education==
Al-Faruqi was born in [[Jaffa]], in British-mandate [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. His father, 'Abd al-Huda al-Faruqi, was an Islamic judge (''[[qadi]]'') and a religious man well-versed in Islamic scholarship. Faruqi received his religious education at home from his father and in the local mosque. He began to attend the French Dominican  [[College Des Frères]] (St. Joseph) in 1936.

His first appointment was as a registrar of cooperative societies (1942) under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government in [[Jerusalem]], which appointed him in 1945 the district governor of [[Galilee]]. Subsequent to the partition plan of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and the creation of the independent [[Jewish]] state of [[Israel]] in 1948, al-Faruqi at first emigrated to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], where he studied at the [[American University of Beirut]], then enrolled the next year at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]'s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, obtaining his M.A. in [[philosophy]] in 1949. He was then accepted for entry into [[Harvard University]]'s department of philosophy and was awarded his second M.A. in philosophy there in March 1951, with a thesis entitled ''Justifying the Good: [[Metaphysics]] and [[Epistemology]] of Value'' (1952).  His dissertation was deeply influenced by the phenomenology of [[Max Scheler]] (1874–1928), particularly the latter's notion of [[axiological intuitionism]]. Al-Faruqi argued that Scheler's axiological intuitionism privileged feeling as knowing, thus recognizing the logic of the heart as an ''a priori'' emotional intuition of value. Such recognition could justify carving out a conceptual as well as practical space for the emergence of a critique of post-Enlightenment Reason from the standpoint of a non-Western philosopher. However, he decided to return to Indiana University; he submitted his thesis to the Department of Philosophy and received his PhD in September 1952. By then he had a background in classical philosophy and the developing thought of the western tradition. In the beginning of 1953, he and his wife were in Syria. He then moved to Egypt, where he studied at Al-Azhar University (1954–1958) again with a view to acquiring another PhD.

In 1958, al-Faruqi was offered a position as a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Divinity at [[McGill University]] in Canada. During his two-year tenure at McGill, he studied Christian theology and Judaism, and became acquainted with the famous Pakistani Muslim philosopher [[Fazlur Rahman]]. During these years, al-Faruqi was preoccupied with his anti-Zionist Arab identity. Rahman reminisced in 1986 that al-Faruqi's blunt anti-Zionism and his refusal to play the detached scholar "frightened" his McGill colleagues. Although he was soft-spoken with unfailing smiles, at McGill he was considered to be, in Rahman's words, "an angry young Muslim Palestinian". In order to challenge al-Faruqi's Arabo-centric views of Islam, and to broaden his scope of understanding the [[ummah]], in 1961, Rahman arranged a two-year appointment for him in Pakistan at the Central Institute of Islamic Research. Rahman intended to expose al-Faruqi to the cultural diversity of Muslims and their contributions to Islam. "Except", Rahman (1986) later recalled, "it was his Arabism which drew a great deal of fire both inside and outside the Institute, as well as his academic preference for Cairo".

==From Arabism to Islamism==

In 1963, after returning to the United States, he was hired as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago's Divinity School. Between 1964 and 1968, al-Faruqi established himself as an associate professor at the Department of Religion at Syracuse University, where he initiated its programme in Islamic Studies. In 1968, he accepted a position at Temple University as a professor of religion, where he also founded the Islamic Studies Programme. He held that position until his death in 1986.

Much of al-Faruqi's early thought is associated with what he called ''urubah'' (Arabism). In his 1962 book, ''On Arabism: Urubah and Religion'', he argued that urubah comprises the core identity and set of values which embrace all Muslims, a single community of believers (ummah). Al-Faruqi formulated the notion of ''urubah'' in contradistinction to two other hegemonic ideologies: Arab nationalism and non-Arab Islamic revivalism. Adopting an overtly essentialist position, he argued that more than merely the language of the Qur'an, Arabic provided the only possible linguistic structure within which the Islamic conception of the world could be apprehended. Therefore, he asserted that ''urubah'' captured the core of Muslim consciousness, its values and faith – it was inseparable from the identity of all Muslims (al-Faruqi, 1962: 2–30).

He also maintained that ''urubah'' was the only context within which the non-Muslim Arabs countries could integrate into their larger societies. Even non-Muslim Arabs, according to al-Faruqi, could identify with ''urubah'' expressed in the Qur'an. In effect, ''urubah'' left non-Muslim Arabs and non-Arab Muslims at the mercy of combined linguistic and religious essentialisms. Any other form of consciousness and identity was a distortion created by colonial penetration (al-Faruqi, 1962: 211).

Though few would question Arab influence on non-Arab Muslim faith and culture or Arab Muslim influence on non-Muslim Arabs, the implication that they both find their ultimate expression and fulfilment in al-Faruqi's interpretation of Arabism might be regarded by some as an attempt to establish the hegemony of Arab Islam or, more precisely, Arab Muslim culture. Both Arab nationalists and non-Arab Muslim intellectuals shunned al-Faruqi's agenda to bring non-Arab Muslims and non-Muslim Arabs together through ''urubah''. While many Muslim intellectuals such as Fazlur Rahman agreed with al-Faruqi's assertion that the Qur'an could not achieve the same eloquence and expressiveness in any other languages except Arabic, they were critical of al-Faruqi's blatant Arab chauvinism. Al-Faruqi's sojourn in Pakistan did little to alter his doctrine of ''urubah''.

It was in the United States several years later that he began to question the foundations of his earlier position. In 1968, for the first time he encountered members of the Muslim Students' Association (MSA) at Temple University. The convergence of Muslim students from diverse cultural backgrounds dramatically swayed his perception of Arab versus Islamic identity. In the spring of 1968, while a patient at the Johns Hopkins Ophthalmology Centre, al-Faruqi confided in one of the active members of the MSA, Ilyas Ba-Yunus, "Until a few months ago, I was a Palestinian, an Arab, and a Muslim. Now I am a Muslim who happens to be an Arab from Palestine" (Ba-Yunus, 1988: 14).

==Scholarly Achievements==
[[Image:Faruqi signature.png|thumb|right|Al-Faruqi's signature]]

Al-Faruqi's early emphasis was on [[Arabism]] as the vehicle of [[Islam]] and [[Muslim]] identity. He was also one of those who proposed the idea of [[Islamization of knowledge]] and founded the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) together with Sheikh Taha Jabir al-Alwani, Dr. Abdul Hamid Sulayman, former Rector of the [[International Islamic University Malaysia|International Islamic University]], [[Malaysia]] (IIUM) and [[Anwar Ibrahim]], in 1980.

During his years as a visiting professor of Islamic studies and scholar-in-residence at [[McGill University]], a professor of Islamic studies at Karachi's Central Institute of Islamic Research as well as a visiting professor at various universities in Northern America, he wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being ''Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas''. He also established the Islamic Studies Group of the American Academy of Religion and chaired it for ten years. He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloqium, The Muslim-Jewish-Christian Conference and as the president of the [[American Islamic College]] in Chicago.

Al-Faruqi viewed the existence of [[Israel]] as an affront towards the religion of Judaism due to its state ideology of [[Religious anti-Zionism#In Islam|Zionism]]. He said that the injustice caused by Zionism is such as to necessitate war. He proposed a resolution in which Israel is dismantled and its institutions de-Zionised; and that former Israeli Jews who have renounced Zionism would live as an "ummatic community" and move freely throughout the Muslim world: "[Islam] requires the Jews to set up their own rabbinic courts and put its whole executive power at its disposal. The ''shari'ah'', the law of Islam, demands of all Jews to submit themselves to the precepts of Jewish law as interpreted by the rabbinic courts, and treats defiance or contempt of the rabbinic court as rebellion against the Islamic state itself, on a par with like action on the part of a Muslim vis-à-vis the Islamic court."&lt;ref&gt;Ismail R. al-Faruqi, "Islam and Zionism," in John L. Esposito, ed., Voices of Resurgent Islam (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In May 1986, Al-Faruqi and his wife were murdered in their Pennsylvania home, in a knife attack committed by a Black Muslim, Joseph Louis Young, who was also known by the Muslim name, Yusuf Ali. Young confessed to the crime and was sentenced to the death penalty and died in prison of natural causes in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/us/black-muslim-charges-in-slaying-of-islamic-scholar-and-his-wife.html|title=Black Muslim Charged in Slaying of Islamic Scholar and His Wife|last=|first=|date=January 18, 1987|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1987-07-08/news/2595065_1_confession-young-knife|title=Confession Details Stalking, Slaying Of Islamic Scholars|last=O'Bryan|first=Ruth|date=July 8, 1987|website=The Morning Call|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pointdebasculecanada.ca/inside-the-capitol-joseph-louis-young-dies-of-natural-causes-on-death-row/|title=Inside the Capitol (Joseph Louis Young dies of natural causes on death row)|last=Bell|first=Adam|date=March 11, 1996|website=The Patriot News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johanne Elisabeth Agerskov''' (1873–1946) was a Danish [[Mediumship|medium]]. Together with her husband, [[Michael Agerskov]], she was responsible for the ethico-religious, philosophical, and pseudo-scientific book, ''[[Toward the Light]]'' (in Danish, ''Vandrer mod Lyset!''), first published by Michael Agerskov in [[Copenhagen]] in 1920.

==Early life==
She was a daughter of a Dutch inventor, minister and principal of the Royal Institute for Deaf-Mutes in Copenhagen [[Rasmus Malling-Hansen]] ( 1835 - 1890 ).

In her younger days Johanne Agerskov worked as a teacher, and she married Michael Agerskov in 1899. Their only daughter, [[Inger Agerskov]], was born in 1900, and Johanne became a housewife. 

==Spiritualism==
During the first decade of the twentieth century, Michael became interested in [[Spiritualism|spiritual phenomena]], and persuaded his wife to participate in [[séance]]s, even though she was skeptical in the beginning. Soon Johanne came to believe that the spirits of the transcendental world had called upon her, and had given her the message that she was a medium, and that before her birth she had promised to be instrumental in bringing eternal truths to mankind.

Convinced that she had a special mission, Agerskov and her husband formed a circle with two more couples, and for many years held weekly séances, in which they believed messages from the spirits of the light were given to Agerskov through intuitive thought-inspiration. She claimed a unique ability to close off her own thoughts, so that all she could "hear" in her mind, according to her, was the thoughts of the spirit with whom she was supposed to be in contact. That was very demanding, and in that period she gave up all the pleasures of social life, in order to be focused and prepared for the séances. The members of the circle would submit questions for her to ask the spirits, and shortly she would give them answers, supposedly from the spirits, which the other participants would write down.

==A message to mankind==

That resulted in the publication of the book, ''Toward the Light'', which Agerskov called "a message to mankind from the transcendental world", and which she and her husband sent out to all the bishops and sixty ministers of the [[Church of Denmark|Danish national church]]. Their hope was that these would participate in a reformation of the Danish church, based upon the new knowledge given in ''Toward the Light''. The Agerskovs made great efforts to that end, through correspondence and by opening their home to anybody who wanted to see them about ''Toward the Light''; but there was little public interest in the book, and the expected reformation did not take place.

Johanne Agerskov was also deeply engaged in the work of her father. In 1924 a Danish professor asserted that Malling-Hansen was not the inventor of the [[Hansen Writing Ball]], and Agerskov undertook a thorough investigation of the facts, together with her sister, [[Engelke Wiberg]]. They wrote several articles on the subject, and Agerskov also wrote a book, called ''Hvem var Skrivekuglens Opfinder?'' (''Who was the Inventor of the Writing Ball?''), published in Copenhagen in 1925.

==Later life==
In 1926 a Society for the Advancement of ''Toward the Light'' was formed {{by whom?|date=February 2016}}, which offered religious services for its members, based on ''Toward the Light''.  Agerskov was skeptical, however, because ''Toward the Light'' calls on believers to remain in the established church and to work for reformation from within.

Even though the Agerskovs in the beginning had participated in spiritualist séances, they soon asked their followers to end that activity, because, as they asserted in ''Toward the Light'', calling on the spirits of deceased ancestors would bring problems to those who could not resist the call to appear.  The spirits, they said, needed to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation, and were not allowed to visit the earth.

Michael Agerskov died in 1933, but Johanne continued to answer letters and to publish up until 1938, in collaboration with their daughter. During the last years of her life, Johanne Agerskov suffered from illness, and was not able to leave her home.

== Photos of Johanne Agerskov ==
There has been controversy among Agerskov's followers over whether or not to publish photos of her, as she said to destroy all her own pictures of herself before she died. Some of the followers of ''Toward the Light!'' contend that her will in this matter should be respected, and oppose the publication of such pictures.

Others see nothing wrong with publishing photos of her, considering that photos of her are available in public collections in both Denmark and Norway, and on the World-Wide Web. This article contains photos of both Agerskov and her husband, supplied by their descendants, who have no objection to their publication.

[[File:Mosav zkenim 003.jpg|thumb|right|The '''Lion of Judah''' on a Bezalel ceramic tile.]]
The '''Lion of Judah''' ([[Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אריה יהודה Aryeh Yehudah}}) is a [[Jewish]] national and cultural symbol, traditionally regarded as the symbol of the [[Israelite]] [[tribe of Judah]]. According to the [[Torah]], the tribe consists of the descendants of [[Judah (biblical person)|Judah]], the fourth son of [[Jacob]]. The association between Judah and the lion can first be found in the blessing given by Jacob to his son Judah in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm |title=Genesis 49:9 |publisher=Biblos |accessdate=1 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217060800/http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm |archivedate=17 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lion of Judah is also mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]], as a term representing [[Jesus]], according to [[Christian]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/revelation/revelation-5/revelation-5-5.html |title=Revelation 5:5 |publisher=Bible Study Tools |accessdate=1 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119173145/http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/revelation/revelation-5/revelation-5-5.html |archivedate=19 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lion of Judah was also one of the titles of the Solomonic Emperors of Ethiopia. It was depicted on a map of the Upper Nile published in 1683 by the Italian Jobi Ludolfi describing the Lion of Judah symbol as the Royal Insignia of the Ethiopian empire. The Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia lasted three thousand years according and has its patrilineal origin in the Israelite Royal House of Judah. The Lion of Judah served as the hereditary title of the Solomonic Ethiopian emperors including [[Menelik II|Menelik]] and [[Haile Selassie]] and was depicted on the [[flag of Ethiopia]] from 1897 to 1974. Due to its association with Haile Selassie, it continues to be an important symbol among members of the [[Rastafari movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/rel-rast.html|title=Rastafarians|website=flagspot.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929081033/https://flagspot.net/flags/rel-rast.html|archivedate=2015-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage==
The biblical [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''Yehuda'') is the [[eponym]]ous ancestor of the [[Tribe of Judah]], which is traditionally symbolized by a lion. In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the patriarch [[Jacob]] ("Israel")  gave that symbol to this tribe when he refers to his son Judah as a ''Gur Aryeh''  גּוּר אַרְיֵה יְהוּדָה, "Young Lion" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=49 |title=Genesis : Chapter 49 |publisher=Bible.ort.org |accessdate=2015-03-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709053029/http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=49 |archivedate=2011-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jew]]ish naming tradition the Hebrew name and the substitute name are often combined as a pair, as in this case. The Lion of Judah was used as a Jewish symbol for many years, and  as [[Jerusalem]] was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], in 1950 it was included in the [[Emblem of Jerusalem]].

===Ethiopian history===
[[File:Imperial_Standard_of_Haile_Selassie_I_of_Ethiopia_(obverse).gif|thumb|Imperial Flag Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, with the Lion of Judah, the [[Cross | cross scepter]] and [[Star of David|four stars of David]].]]
[[Ethiopia]]'s history as recorded and elaborated in a 13th-century treatise, the ''[[Kebra Nagast|Kebre Negest]]'', asserts descent from a retinue of Israelites who returned with Makeda, the [[Queen of Sheba]] from her visit to [[King Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]], by whom she had conceived the Solomonic dynasty's founder [[Menelik I]]. As Solomon was of the tribe of Judah, his son Menelik I would continue the line, which according to Ethiopian history was passed directly down from king to king until Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] (ostensibly the 225th king from [[King David]]) was deposed in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/cardillo.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521083740/http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/cardillo.html |archivedate=2017-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-modern-african-studies/article/the-lion-of-judah-in-the-new-world-emperor-haile-selassie-of-ethiopia-and-the-shaping-of-americans-attitude-toward-africa-by-vestaltsanta-barbara-ca-praeger-2011-pp-231-4495-hbk/33B769CFED176DD2506C21D840D5E4D0#|title=The Lion of Judah in the New World: Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and the shaping of Americans’ attitude toward Africa by Vestal T.Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger, 2011.

Both [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Christian]] and [[Beta Israel|Jewish]] Ethiopian history have it that there were also immigrants of the Tribes of [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]] and Judah that accompanied Makeda back from her visit to Solomon; hence the [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] motto ''Mo`a 'Anbessa Ze'imnegede Yihuda'' ("The Lion of Judah has conquered"), included among the titles of the Emperor throughout the Solomonic Dynasty. It is unknown whether [[John of Patmos]] was directly aware of this hereditary title when he penned it into the text of the [[prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionofjudahsociety.org/shop/kebra-nagast-ethiopic-text-manuscript/|title=KEBRA NAGAST Ethiopic Text &amp; Manuscript - The Lion Of Judah Society|website=The Lion Of Judah Society|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107100109/http://www.lionofjudahsociety.org/shop/kebra-nagast-ethiopic-text-manuscript/|archivedate=2017-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lion of Judah motif figured prominently on the old imperial flag, currency, stamps, etc. and may still be seen gracing the terrace of the capital as a national symbol. After the collapse of the [[Communist]] [[Derg]] in 1990 and the increase of [[Western world|Western-style]] [[political freedom]]s, a minor political party bearing the name ''Mo'a Anbessa'' made its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/kebra_budge.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130160227/http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/kebra_budge.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rastafari movement===
The Lion of Judah is a prominent symbol in the Rastafari movement. It represents Emperor Haile Selassie I as well as being a symbol of strength, kingship, pride and African sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Barnett 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Michael|last2=Onuora|first2=Adwoa Ntozake|title=Rastafari in the New Millennium: A Rastafari Reader|date=2014|publisher=Syracuse University Press|chapter=Rastafari as Afrocentrically Based Discourse and Spiritual Expression}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rastafari consider the mention of "The Lion of Judah" in Genesis 49:9 and Revelation 5:5 of The Bible to refer to Emperor Haile Selassie I. Rastafari hail Haile Selassie I with the titles "KING of Kings, LORD of lords, Conquering Lion of Judah, Elect of God, the Light of the World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chislom|first1=Clinton|editor1-last=Murrel|editor1-first=Nathaniel Samuel|editor2-last=et al|title=Chanting Down Babylon: The Rastafari Reader|date=1998|publisher=Temple University Press|page=171|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iesWzLHb_GUC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=haile%20selassie%20titles%20coronation&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=The Rasta-Selassie-Ethiopian Connections|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918020712/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iesWzLHb_GUC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=haile%20selassie%20titles%20coronation&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2016-09-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Thesouro de Nobreza. Judah.png|150px|thumb|Lion of Judah ("Thesouro de Nobreza", 1675)]]
The phrase appears in the [[New Testament]] in {{bibleref2|Revelation 5:5}}: "And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof." This is widely regarded as a reference to Jesus among [[Christians]].

Many Christian organizations and ministries use the lion of Judah as their emblem or even as their name.

===Fantasy and fiction===
Inspired by the Lion of Judah, [[C. S. Lewis]] used a lion named [[Aslan]] to represent Jesus in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/liam.neeson.says.narnias.aslan.could.be.muhammed/27215.htm |title=Liam Neeson says Narnia’s Aslan could be Muhammed &amp;#124; Christian News on Christian Today |publisher=Christiantoday.com |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSfy5D_LNDQC&amp;pg=PA424 |title=C.S.

His areas of research have focussed on the subjects of [[logic]], [[History of Philosophy|history of philosophy]] and, in particular, [[ethics]].
In the [[Existentialism|existential]]-[[Personalism|personalistic]] [[humanism]] of Sánchez Cuesta
&lt;ref&gt;
In the book "Spanish Philosophical Thinking" (translated) of Maceiras, M. and others, Pensamiento filosófico español, Vol. II (Del Barroco a nuestros días), Madrid, 2002, p. 318, {{ISBN|84-7738-980-2}} and also in "Men and documents of the Spanish philosophy" (translated) of Díaz Díaz, Gonzalo, ''Hombres y documentos de la filosofía española'', Volume III (letters N-Z), edition and coordination by Antonio Heredia Soriano (currently being printed), the motivations behind the works of the philosopher Sánchez Cuesta are described.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
the everyday stands in the center of his ethical reflection. 
It is in the everyday, in fact, where the time of each human being is transmuted into an indefinite number of possibilities that are permanently open him or her. In consequence, the person can not only be able to trace the goal that it aspires, but also provide it with a substantiating [[Virtue ethics|virtuous]] character. "Whoever succeeds - writes Agapito Maestre (translated) - to live his daily life morally, and this and no other is the therapeutic value of this work [Note: that of Sánchez Cuesta], will have managed to make the ''carpe diem'' of the classics [Note: philosophers] come true."

&lt;/ref&gt;

The following applies to the writings of Professor Sánchez Cuesta in general. As one of his books´ review [''The ethics of the Greeks'' (translated) or, ''La ética de los griegos'' (original title)] by Professor José Miguel Marinas summarizes: "And here is undoubtedly the main attraction of an elegant work with apparently simple looks: is the text of a free man, which is aimed at adult readers"

'''Moral universalism''' (also called '''moral objectivism''') is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] position that some system of ethics, or a universal ethic, applies [[universality (philosophy)|universally]], that is, for "all similarly situated individuals",&lt;ref name=PhilPages/&gt; regardless of [[culture]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[nationality]], [[sexual orientation]], or any other distinguishing feature.&lt;ref name=Gowans/&gt; Moral universalism is opposed to [[moral nihilism]] and [[moral relativism]]. However, not all forms of moral universalism are [[moral absolutism|absolutist]], nor are they necessarily [[value monism|value monist]]; many forms of universalism, such as [[utilitarianism]], are non-absolutist, and some forms, such as that of [[Isaiah Berlin]], may be [[value pluralism|value pluralist]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In addition to the theories of [[moral realism]], moral universalism includes other cognitivist moral theories, such as the subjectivist [[ideal observer theory]] and [[divine command theory]], and also the non-cognitivist moral theory of [[universal prescriptivism]].&lt;ref name=noncognitivism/&gt;&lt;ref name=prescriptivism/&gt;

==Overview==
According to philosophy professor R. W. Hepburn: "To move towards the objectivist pole is to argue that moral judgements can be rationally defensible, true or false, that there are rational procedural tests for identifying morally impermissible actions, or that moral values exist independently of the feeling-states of individuals at particular times."&lt;ref name=Hepburn/&gt;

[[Linguistics|Linguist]] and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] states: &lt;blockquote&gt;"if we adopt the principle of universality: if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us. Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others—more stringent ones, in fact—plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong, good and evil."&lt;ref name=Chomsky/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}

The [[United Nations]]' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] can be read as assuming a kind of moral universalism. The drafting committee of the Universal Declaration did assume, or at least aspired to, a "universal" approach to articulating international human rights. Although the Declaration has undeniably come to be accepted throughout the world as a cornerstone of the international system for the protection of human rights, a belief among some that the Universal Declaration does not adequately reflect certain important worldviews has given rise to more than one supplementary declaration, such as the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Bangkok Declaration|Bangkok Declaration]].&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;

Global environmental treaties may also assume and present a moral universalism. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] is founded upon the "common heritage of mankind". Protecting this heritage is presented in the treaty as a shared moral duty requiring protective actions based on "common but differentiated responsibilities". This has been criticised as anthropocentric and state-centric but it does assert universal goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rai, Jasdev Singh; Thorheim, Celia; Dorjderem, Amarbayasgalan; Macer, Darryl|title=Universalism and ethical values for the environment|date=2010|publisher=UNESCO Office Bangkok and Regional Bureau for Education in Asia and the Pacific|location=Thailand|isbn=978-92-9223-301-3|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=188607|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempts to define a universal morality ===
In his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] attempts to derive a supreme principle of morality that binds all [[rational agents]]. Similarly, [[divine command theory]] presents a form of universalism, by way of the unconditional morality of God's commandments.

This case involves synchronized action potentials in [[neocortex|neocortical]] pyramidal neurons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 1.1 ''The Neuronal Correlates of Consciousness'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The '''neural correlates of consciousness''' ('''NCC''') constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious [[Perception#Process_and_terminology|percept]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover [[neural correlate]]s of subjective phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313192029/http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html |date=2013-03-13 }} for a glossary of related terms.&lt;/ref&gt; The set should be ''minimal'' because, under the assumption that the brain is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, the question is which of its components is necessary to produce it.

==Neurobiological approach to consciousness==
A science of [[consciousness]] must explain the exact relationship between subjective mental states and brain states, the nature of the relationship between the conscious mind and the electro-chemical interactions in the body ([[mind–body problem]]). Progress in [[neuropsychology]] and [[neurophilosophy]] has come from focusing on the body rather than the mind. In this context the neuronal correlates of consciousness may be viewed as its causes, and [[consciousness]] may be thought of as a state-dependent property of some undefined [[complex systems|complex]], adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Squire2008|Squire 2008]], p. 1223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovering and characterizing neural correlates does not offer a theory of consciousness that can explain how particular systems experience anything at all, or how and why they are associated with consciousness, the so-called [[hard problem of consciousness]],&lt;ref name="Kandel2007p382"&gt;[[#Kandel2007|Kandel 2007]], p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; but understanding the NCC may be a step toward such a theory. Most neurobiologists assume that the variables giving rise to consciousness are to be found at the neuronal level, governed by classical physics, though a few scholars have proposed theories of [[quantum consciousness]] based on [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quantum physics in neuroscience and psychology: A neurophysiological model of mind/brain interaction |author1=Jeffrey M. Schwartz |author2=Henry P. Stapp |author3=Mario Beauregard |url=http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~stapp/PTB6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great apparent redundancy and parallelism in neural networks so, while activity in one group of neurons may correlate with a percept in one case, a different population might mediate a related percept if the former population is lost or inactivated. It may be that every phenomenal, subjective state has a neural correlate. Where the NCC can be induced artificially the subject will experience the associated percept, while perturbing or inactivating the region of correlation for a specific percept will affect the percept or cause it to disappear, giving a cause-effect relationship from the neural region to the nature of the percept.

What characterizes the NCC? What are the commonalities between the NCC for seeing and for hearing? Will the NCC involve all the [[Pyramidal cell|pyramidal neurons]] in the cortex at any given point in time? Or only a subset of long-range projection cells in the frontal lobes that project to the sensory cortices in the back? Neurons that fire in a rhythmic manner? Neurons that fire in a [[neural oscillations|synchronous manner]]? These are some of the proposals that have been advanced over the years.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Chalmers1998|Chalmers 1998]], available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools (e.g., [[#Adamantidis2007|Adamantidis et al. 2007]]) depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioral assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. It is the combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, that will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness, one of the central mysteries of life.

==Level of arousal and content of consciousness==
There are two common but distinct dimensions of the term ''consciousness'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zeman2001|Zeman 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt; one involving ''arousal'' and ''states of consciousness'' and the other involving ''content of consciousness'' and ''conscious states''. To be conscious ''of'' anything the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether in wakefulness or [[REM sleep]], vividly experienced in dreams although usually not remembered. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian]] rhythm but may be influenced by lack of sleep, drugs and alcohol, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude that triggers some criterion reaction (for instance, the sound level necessary to evoke an eye movement or a head turn toward the sound source). Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients.

High arousal states are associated with conscious states that have specific content, seeing, hearing, remembering, planning or fantasizing about something. Different levels or states of consciousness are associated with different kinds of conscious experiences. The "awake" state is quite different from the "dreaming" state (for instance, the latter has little or no self-reflection) and from the state of deep sleep. In all three cases the basic physiology of the brain is affected, as it also is in ''altered states of consciousness'', for instance after taking drugs or during meditation when conscious perception and insight may be enhanced compared to the normal waking state.

Clinicians talk about ''impaired states of consciousness'' as in "the [[coma|comatose state]]", "the [[persistent vegetative state]]" (PVS), and "the [[minimally conscious state]]" (MCS). Here, "state" refers to different "amounts" of external/physical consciousness, from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and general anesthesia, to a fluctuating and limited form of conscious sensation in a minimally conscious state such as sleep walking or during a complex partial [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schiff2004|Schiff 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; The repertoire of conscious states or experiences accessible to a patient in a minimally conscious state is comparatively limited. In brain death there is no arousal, but it is unknown whether the subjectivity of experience has been interrupted, rather than its observable link with the organism.

The potential ''richness of conscious experience'' appears to increase from deep sleep to drowsiness to full wakefulness, as might be quantified using notions from complexity theory that incorporate both the dimensionality as well as the granularity of conscious experience to give an [[Integrated information theory|integrated-information-theoretical account]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tononi2016|Tononi et al. 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; As behavioral arousal increases so does the range and complexity of possible behavior. Yet in REM sleep there is a characteristic [[atonia]], low motor arousal and the person is difficult to wake up, but there is still high metabolic and electric brain activity and vivid perception.

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==The neuronal basis of perception==
The possibility of precisely manipulating visual percepts in time and space has made [[visual perception|vision]] a preferred modality in the quest for the NCC. Psychologists have perfected a number of techniques – [[Visual masking|masking]], [[binocular rivalry]], [[flash suppression|continuous flash suppression]], [[motion induced blindness]], [[change blindness]], [[inattentional blindness]] – in which the seemingly simple and unambiguous relationship between a physical stimulus in the world and its associated percept in the privacy of the subject's mind is disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#KimBlake2004|Kim and Blake 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular a stimulus can be perceptually suppressed for seconds or even minutes at a time: the image is projected into one of the observer's eyes but is invisible, not seen. In this manner the neural mechanisms that respond to the subjective percept rather than the physical stimulus can be isolated, permitting visual consciousness to be tracked in the brain. In a ''perceptual [[illusion]]'', the physical stimulus remains fixed while the percept fluctuates. The best known example is the ''[[Necker cube]]'' whose 12 lines can be perceived in one of two different ways in depth.

[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness3.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Necker Cube: The left line drawing can be perceived in one of two distinct depth configurations shown on the right. Without any other cue, the visual system flips back and forth between these two interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 16.1 ''The Bistable Necker Cube'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A perceptual illusion that can be precisely controlled is ''[[binocular rivalry]]''. Here, a small image, e.g., a horizontal grating, is presented to the left eye, and another image, e.g., a vertical grating, is shown to the corresponding location in the right eye. In spite of the constant visual stimulus, observers consciously see the horizontal grating alternate every few seconds with the vertical one. The brain does not allow for the simultaneous perception of both images.

Logothetis and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;[[#Logothetis1998|Logothetis 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; recorded a variety of visual cortical areas in awake macaque monkeys performing a binocular rivalry task. Macaque monkeys can be trained to report whether they see the left or the right image. The distribution of the switching times and the way in which changing the contrast in one eye affects these leaves little doubt that monkeys and humans experience the same basic phenomenon. In the primary visual cortex (V1) only a small fraction of cells weakly modulated their response as a function of the percept of the monkey while most cells responded to one or the other retinal stimulus with little regard to what the animal perceived at the time. But in a high-level cortical area such as the inferior temporal cortex along the [[ventral stream]] almost all neurons responded only to the perceptually dominant stimulus, so that a "face" cell only fired when the animal indicated that it saw the face and not the pattern presented to the other eye. This implies that NCC involve neurons active in the inferior temporal cortex: it is likely that specific reciprocal actions of neurons in the inferior temporal and parts of the prefrontal cortex are necessary.

A number of [[fMRI]] experiments that have exploited binocular rivalry and related illusions to identify the hemodynamic activity underlying visual consciousness in humans demonstrate quite conclusively that activity in the upper stages of the ventral pathway (e.g., the [[fusiform face area]] and the [[parahippocampal place area]]) as well as in early regions, including V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), follow the percept and not the retinal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ReesFrith2007|Rees and Frith 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a number of fMRI&lt;ref&gt;[[#HaynesRees2005|Haynes and Rees 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee2007|Lee et al. 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; and DTI experiments&lt;ref&gt;[[#ShimonoNiki2013|Shimono and Niki 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest V1 is necessary but not sufficient for visual consciousness.&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;[[#CrickKoch1995|Crick and Koch 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a related perceptual phenomenon, ''[[flash suppression]]'', the percept associated with an image projected into one eye is suppressed by flashing another image into the other eye while the original image remains. Its methodological advantage over binocular rivalry is that the timing of the perceptual transition is determined by an external trigger rather than by an internal event. The majority of cells in the inferior temporal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus of monkeys trained to report their percept during flash suppression follow the animal's percept: when the cell's preferred stimulus is perceived, the cell responds. If the picture is still present on the retina but is perceptually suppressed, the cell falls silent, even though primary visual cortex neurons fire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeopoldLogothetis1996|Leopold and Logothetis 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#SheinbergLogothetis1997|Sheinberg and Logothetis 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; Single-neuron recordings in the medial temporal lobe of epilepsy patients during flash suppression likewise demonstrate abolishment of response when the preferred stimulus is present but perceptually masked.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreiman2002|Kreiman et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global disorders of consciousness==
Given the absence of any accepted criterion of the minimal neuronal correlates necessary for consciousness, the distinction between a persistently vegetative patient who shows regular sleep-wave transitions and may be able to move or smile, and a minimally conscious patient who can communicate (on occasion) in a meaningful manner (for instance, by differential eye movements) and who shows some signs of consciousness, is often difficult. In global anesthesia the patient should not experience psychological trauma but the level of arousal should be compatible with clinical exigencies.

[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Midline structures in the brainstem and thalamus necessary to regulate the level of brain arousal. Small, bilateral lesions in many of these nuclei cause a global loss of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 5.1 ''The Cholinergic Enabling System'' p. 92. See Chapter 5, available on line.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Blood-oxygen-level-dependent [[fMRI]] have demonstrated normal patterns of brain activity in a patient in a vegetative state following a severe traumatic brain injury when asked to imagine playing tennis or visiting rooms in his/her house.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owen2006|Owen et al. 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Differential brain imaging of patients with such global disturbances of consciousness (including [[akinetic mutism]]) reveal that dysfunction in a widespread cortical network including medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal associative areas is associated with a global loss of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Laureys2005|Laureys 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Impaired consciousness in [[epileptic]] seizures of the [[medial temporal lobe|temporal lobe]] was likewise accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal association cortex and an increase in midline structures such as the [[thalamus|mediodorsal thalamus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blumenfeld2004|Blumenfeld et al. 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively local bilateral injuries to midline (paramedian) subcortical structures can also cause a complete loss of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]],  p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; These structures therefore ''enable'' and control brain arousal (as determined by metabolic or electrical activity) and are necessary neural correlates. One such example is the heterogeneous collection of more than two dozen nuclei on each side of the upper brainstem (pons, midbrain and in the posterior hypothalamus), collectively referred to as the [[reticular activating system]] (RAS). Their axons project widely throughout the brain. These nuclei – three-dimensional collections of neurons with their own cyto-architecture and neurochemical identity – release distinct neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline/norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine and orexin/hypocretin to control the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain, mediating alternation between wakefulness and sleep as well as general level of behavioral and brain arousal. After such trauma, however, eventually the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain can recover and consciousness can return.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Villablanca2004|Villablanca 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another enabling factor for consciousness are the five or more [[intralaminar nuclei]] (ILN) of the thalamus. These receive input from many brainstem nuclei and project strongly, directly to the basal ganglia and, in a more distributed manner, into layer I of much of the neocortex. Comparatively small (1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or less) bilateral lesions in the thalamic ILN completely knock out all awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bogen1995|Bogen 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forward versus feedback projections==
Many actions in response to sensory inputs are rapid, transient, stereotyped, and unconscious.&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;[[#MilnerGoodale1995|Milner and Goodale 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; They could be thought of as cortical reflexes and are characterized by rapid and somewhat stereotyped responses that can take the form of rather complex automated behavior as seen, e.g., in complex partial [[epileptic]] seizures. These automated responses, sometimes called ''zombie behaviors'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#KochCrick2001|Koch and Crick 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt; could be contrasted by a slower, all-purpose conscious mode that deals more slowly with broader, less stereotyped aspects of the sensory inputs (or a reflection of these, as in imagery) and takes time to decide on appropriate thoughts and responses. Without such a consciousness mode, a vast number of different zombie modes would be required to react to unusual events.

A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("[[physiological prematurity]]"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beilock2002|Beilock et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From an evolutionary standpoint it clearly makes sense to have both automated behavioral programs that can be executed rapidly in a stereotyped and automated manner, and a slightly slower system that allows time for thinking and planning more complex behavior. This latter aspect may be one of the principal functions of consciousness. Other philosophers, however, have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=[[Owen Flanagan]] and T. W. Polger |year=1995 |title=Zombies and the function of consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |pages=313–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=David|title=Consciousness and its function|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2008|volume=46|pages=829–840|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one has given a causal explanation, they argue, of why it would not be possible for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism (i.e., a [[philosophical zombie]]) to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism. If evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function ''F'' being performed by conscious organism ''O'' and non-conscious organism ''O*'', it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Stevan Harnad]] |year=2002 |chapter= Turing indistinguishability and the Blind Watchmaker |editor=J. H. Fetzer |title=Consciousness Evolving |publisher=John Benjamins |url=http://cogprints.org/1615 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an [[exaptation]] arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3790330 | pmid=24109460 | doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00667 | volume=4 | title=The evolutionary and genetic origins of consciousness in the Cambrian Period over 500 million years ago. | year=2013 | journal=Front Psychol | pages=667 |vauthors=Feinberg TE, Mallatt J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina, but instead just a by-product of the way the retinal axons were wired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zack ROBINSON |author2=Corey J. MALEY |author3=Gualtiero PICCININI | year = 2015 | title = Is Consciousness a Spandrel?. | url = | journal = Journal of the American Philosophical Association | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 365–383 | doi = 10.1017/apa.2014.10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several scholars including Pinker, Chomsky, Edelman, and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the development of higher-order consciousness.

It seems possible that visual zombie modes in the cortex mainly use the [[Two Streams hypothesis#Dorsal stream|dorsal stream]] in the parietal region.&lt;ref name="milner"/&gt; However, parietal activity can affect consciousness by producing attentional effects on the ventral stream, at least under some circumstances. The conscious mode for vision depends largely on the early visual areas (beyond V1) and especially on the ventral stream.

Seemingly complex visual processing (such as detecting animals in natural, cluttered scenes) can be accomplished by the human cortex within 130–150 ms,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorpe1996|Thorpe et al. 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#VanRullenKoch2003|VanRullen and Koch 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; far too brief for eye movements and conscious perception to occur. Furthermore, reflexes such as the [[oculovestibular reflex]] take place at even more rapid time-scales. It is quite plausible that such behaviors are mediated by a purely feed-forward moving wave of spiking activity that passes from the retina through V1, into V4, IT and prefrontal cortex, until it affects motorneurons in the spinal cord that control the finger press (as in a typical laboratory experiment). The hypothesis that the basic processing of information is feedforward is supported most directly by the short times (approx. 100 ms) required for a selective response to appear in IT cells.

Conversely, conscious perception is believed to require more sustained, reverberatory neural activity, most likely via global feedback from frontal regions of neocortex back to sensory cortical areas&lt;ref name= "Crick"/&gt; that builds up over time until it exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the sustained neural activity rapidly propagates to parietal, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions, thalamus, claustrum and related structures that support short-term memory, multi-modality integration, planning, speech, and other processes intimately related to consciousness. Competition prevents more than one or a very small number of percepts to be simultaneously and actively represented. This is the core hypothesis of the [[global workspace theory]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baars1988|Baars 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dehaene2003|Dehaene et al. 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, while rapid but transient neural activity in the thalamo-cortical system can mediate complex behavior without conscious sensation, it is surmised that consciousness requires sustained but well-organized neural activity dependent on long-range cortico-cortical feedback.

'''Nuclear peace''' is a theory of [[international relations]] that argues that under some circumstances [[nuclear weapon]]s can induce stability and decrease the chances of crisis escalation. In particular, nuclear weapons are said to have induced stability during the [[Cold War]], when both the [[US]] and the [[USSR]] possessed mutual [[second strike]] retaliation capability, eliminating the possibility of nuclear victory for either side. Proponents of nuclear peace argue that controlled [[nuclear proliferation]] may be beneficial for inducing stability. Critics of nuclear peace argue that nuclear proliferation not only increases the chance of [[nuclear war|interstate nuclear conflict]], but increases the chances of [[nuclear material]] falling into the hands of [[violent non-state actor|violent]] [[non-state actor|non-state groups]] who are free from the threat of nuclear retaliation.

The major debate on this issue has been between [[Kenneth Waltz]], the founder of [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealist theory]] in international relations, and [[Scott Sagan]], a leading proponent of organizational theories in international politics. Waltz generally argues that "more may be better," contending that new [[nuclear state]]s will use their acquired nuclear capabilities to [[nuclear deterrence|deter]] threats and preserve peace.  Sagan argues that "more will be worse", since new nuclear states often lack adequate organizational controls over their new weapons, which makes for a high risk of either deliberate or accidental nuclear war, or theft of nuclear material by [[terrorist]]s to perpetrate [[nuclear terrorism]].

== Argument ==
A nuclear peace results when the costs of war are unacceptably high for both sides. In a two-sided conflict where both sides have mutual second strike capability, defense becomes impossible so it is the very prospect of fighting the war, rather than the possibility of losing it, that induces restraint.

In a condition of [[mutually assured destruction]], there are [[civilian]] "[[hostage]]s" on both sides, which facilitates cooperation by acting as an informal mechanism of contract enforcement between states. There are economic equivalents of such informal mechanisms used to effect credible commitment; for example, [[corporation]]s use "hostages" (in the form of initial setup costs that act as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]) to deter [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] and [[franchisee]]s from cheating.

Nuclear weapons may also lessen a [[sovereign state|state]]'s reliance on [[allies]] for [[national security|security]], thus preventing allies from dragging each other into wars (a phenomenon known as [[chain ganging]], frequently said to be a major [[cause of World War I]]).

Since the death of civilians is an essential part of mutually assured destruction, one normative consequence of nuclear weapons is that [[war]] loses its historical function as a symbol of glory and measure of national strength.

As a method of preventing a destabilizing [[arms race]], the concept of [[minimal deterrence]] represents one way of solving the [[security dilemma]] and avoiding an arms race.

A study published in the ''[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]]'' in 2009 [[quantitative research|quantitatively evaluated]] the nuclear peace [[hypothesis]] and found support for the existence of the [[stability-instability paradox]]. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability and prevent largescale wars, they simultaneously allow for more [[low intensity conflict|lower intensity conflicts]]. When a nuclear monopoly exists between two states, and one state has nuclear weapons and its opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, when there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.&lt;ref&gt;http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/53/2/258.short Evaluating the Nuclear Peace Hypothesis A Quantitative Approach.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of argument ==
Critics argue that war can occur even under conditions of mutually assured destruction:

Actors are not always rational, as bureaucratic procedure and internal intrigue may cause subrational outcomes. Related to and reinforcing that point is that there is always an element of uncertainty. One cannot always control emotions, subordinates, and equipment, especially when one has limited information and is faced with high stakes and fast timetables. There are [[unintended consequence]]s, unwanted escalation, irrationality, misperception, and the [[security dilemma]].

Another reason is that deterrence has an inherent instability. As Kenneth Boulding said: "If deterrence were really stable… it would cease to deter." If decisionmakers were perfectly rational, they would never order the largescale use of nuclear weapons, and the credibility of the nuclear threat would be low.

However, that apparent perfect rationality criticism is countered and so not inconsistent with current deterrence policy. In ''[[Essentials of Post-Cold War Deterrence]]'', the authors detail an explicit advocation of ambiguity regarding "what is permitted" for other nations and its endorsement of "irrationality" or, more precisely, the perception thereof as an important tool in deterrence and foreign policy. The document claims that the capacity of the United States, in exercising deterrence, would be hurt by portraying US leaders as fully rational and cool-headed: 

{{quote|The fact that some elements may appear to be potentially 'out of control' can be beneficial to creating and reinforcing fears and doubts in the minds of an adversary's decision makers. This essential sense of fear is the working force of deterrence. That the U.S. may become irrational and vindictive if its vital interests are attacked should be part of the national persona we project to all adversaries.}}

Some commentators critical of the concept of nuclear peace further make the argument that nonstate actors and rogue states could supply nuclear weapons to [[nuclear terrorism|terrorist]] organizations and thereby undermine conventional deterrence and therefore nuclear peace, especially with the existence of international terrorist networks seeking access to nuclear sources.

However [[Robert Gallucci]], president of the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], argues that although traditional deterrence is not an effective approach toward terrorist groups bent on causing a nuclear catastrophe, "the United States should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence, which focuses not solely on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them. By threatening retaliation against those states, the United States may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallucci|first=Robert|title=Averting Nuclear Catastrophe: Contemplating Extreme Responses to U.S. Vulnerability|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2006|volume= 607|pages=51–58|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/content/607/1/51.abstract|accessdate=28 January 2013|doi=10.1177/0002716206290457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Graham Allison]] makes a similar case and argues that the key to expanded deterrence is coming up with ways of tracing nuclear material to the country that forged the fissile material: "After a nuclear bomb detonates, [[nuclear forensics|nuclear forensic]] cops would collect debris samples and send them to a laboratory for radiological analysis. By identifying unique attributes of the fissile material, including its impurities and contaminants, one could trace the path back to its origin."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=Allison|first=Graham|title=How to Keep the Bomb From Terrorists|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/03/13/how-to-keep-the-bomb-from-terrorists.html|accessdate=28 January 2013|newspaper=Newsweek|date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints: "The goal would be twofold: first, to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons; second, to give leaders every incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Biography==
Ukkira Peruvaludhi was a ruler of the [[Pandyan dynasty]] and a patron of the late Sangam. He defeated Vengaimarbhan, the king of Gaanapereyil or Kaalaiyar Koil, and hence came to be known as "Pandiyan Gaanapereyil Thandha Ukkira Peruvaludhi". He was the ally of the [[Chera dynasty|Chera King]] Mavenko and Rajasooyam Vetta Perunar Killi. The Sangam work of [[Agananuru]] is believed to have compiled in his court.&lt;ref name="SangaIlakkiyam_3"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">'''Perdurantism''' or '''perdurance theory''' is a philosophical theory of persistence and [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/temporal-parts/ Temporal parts] - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;  The perdurantist view is that an individual has distinct [[temporal parts]] throughout its existence. Perdurantism is usually presented as the antipode to [[endurantism]], the view that an individual is wholly present at every moment of its existence.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

The use of "endure" and "perdure" to distinguish two ways in which an object can be thought to persist can be traced to [[David Kellogg Lewis]] (1986). However, contemporary debate has demonstrated the difficulties in defining perdurantism (and also endurantism). For instance, the work of [[Ted Sider]] (2001) has suggested that even enduring objects can have temporal parts, and it is more accurate to define perdurantism as being the claim that objects have a temporal part at every instant that they exist. Currently there is no universally acknowledged definition of perdurantism (see also McKinnon (2002) and Merricks (1999)). Others argue that this problem is avoided by creating time as a continuous function, rather than a discrete one.

Perdurantism is also referred to as "[[four-dimensionalism]]" (by Ted Sider, in particular) but perdurantism also applies if one believes there are temporal but non-spatial abstract entities (like immaterial souls or universals of the sort accepted by [[David Malet Armstrong]]).&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worm theorists and stage theorists==

Perdurantists break into two distinct sub-groups: worm theorists and stage theorists.

'''Worm theorists''' believe that a persisting object is composed of the various temporal parts that it has. It can be said that objects that persist are extended through the time dimension of the block universe much as physical objects are extended in space. Thus, they believe that all persisting objects are four-dimensional "worms" that stretch across space-time, and that you are mistaken in believing that chairs, mountains, and people are simply three-dimensional.&lt;ref name="Ehring2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Ehring|title=Tropes: Properties, Objects, and Mental Causation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXgvisZQYIkC&amp;pg=PA100|date=25 August 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-960853-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy D. Miller|title=Continuous Creation, Persistence, and Secondary Causation: An Essay in the Metaphysics of Theism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_Um-Nb-pIsC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-39708-3|pages=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage theorists''' take discussion of persisting objects to be talk of a particular temporal part, or stage, of an object at any given time. So, in a manner of speaking, a subject only exists for an instantaneous period of time. However, there are other temporal parts at other times which that subject is related to in a certain way (Sider talks of "modal counterpart relations",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sider|first=Theodore|date=1996-09-01|title=All the world's a stage|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00048409612347421|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=74|issue=3|pages=433–453|doi=10.1080/00048409612347421|issn=0004-8402}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Hawley talks of "non-Humean relations") such that when someone says that they were a child, or that they will be an elderly person, these things are true, because they bear a special "identity-like" relation to a temporal part that is a child (that exists in the past) or a temporal part that is an elderly person (that exists in the future). Stage theorists are sometimes called "exdurantists".

It has been argued that stage theory, unlike the worm theory, should be favored as it accurately accounts for the contents of our experience. The latter requires that we currently experience more than a single moment of our lives while we actually find ourselves experiencing only one instant of time, in line with the stage view.&lt;ref&gt;Balashov, Y. (2015). Experiencing the Present. Epistemology &amp; Philosophy of Science, 44(2), 61-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skow, B. (2011).

[https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/75/2/237/165507 A phenomenological argument for stage theory]. Analysis, 75(2), 237-242&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the other hand, as Stuchlik (2003) states, the stage theory will not work under the possibility of [[Gunk (mereology)|gunky time]], which states that for every interval of time, there is a sub-interval, and according to Zimmerman (1996), there have been many self-professed perdurantists who believe that time is gunky or contains no instants. Some perdurantists think the idea of gunk means there are no instants, since they define these as intervals of time with no subintervals.

A '''pirate code''', '''pirate articles''' or '''articles of agreement''' were a [[code of conduct]] for governing [[pirates]]. A group of sailors, on turning pirate, would draw up their own code or articles, which provided rules for discipline, division of stolen goods, and compensation for injured pirates.

==History and applications==
[[File:Pyle pirate marooned.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Marooning|marooned]] pirate, according to [[Howard Pyle]].]]
[[Buccaneer]]s, like other ships of the time, operated under [[ship's articles]] that, ''[[inter alia]]'', governed conduct of the crew. These "articles of agreement" became authority independent of any nation, and were variously called the Chasse-Partie, Charter Party, Custom of the Coast, or Jamaica Discipline.  In retrospect, these became known as the Pirate's Code.  Pirate articles varied from one captain to another, and sometimes even from one voyage to another, but they were generally alike in including provisions for [[discipline]], specifications for each crewmate's share of treasure, and compensation for the injured.

Each crew member was asked to sign or make his mark on the articles, then swear an [[oath]] of allegiance or honour.  The oath was sometimes taken on a [[Bible]], but [[John Phillips (pirate)|John Phillips]]' men, lacking a Bible, swore on an axe.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Charles (1724), ''A General History of the Pyrates'', p. 398 {{OCLC|561824965}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Legend suggests that other pirates swore on crossed [[pistol]]s, [[sword]]s, or on a [[human skull]], or astride a [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|cannon]].  This act formally inducted the signer into the pirate crew, generally entitling him to [[vote]] for officers and on other "affairs of moment", to bear arms, and to his share of the plunder. The articles having been signed, they were then posted in a prominent place, often the door to the captain's cabin.&lt;ref&gt;Little, Benerson (2005), ''The Sea Rover's Practice: Pirate Tactics and Techniques'', Potomac Books, Inc., {{ISBN|1-57488-910-9}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a piratical cruise began, new recruits from captured ships would sometimes sign the articles, in some cases voluntarily, in other cases under threat of torture or death. Valuable sea [[artisan]]s, such as [[carpenter]]s and [[navigation|navigators]], were especially likely to be forced to sign articles under duress, and would rarely be released regardless of their decision to sign or not. In some cases, even willing recruits would ask the pirates to pretend to force them to sign, so that they could plead they were forced should they ever be captured by the law.&lt;ref&gt;''Sometimes seamen who volunteered to join the pirates asked the quartermaster to go through the motions of forcing them in the presence of their officers. The quartermaster was happy to oblige and do a blustery piratical turn for them, with much waving of cutlasses and mouthing of oaths.'' Botting, Douglas ''The Pirates'', Time-Life Books Inc., p. 51. &lt;/ref&gt; Generally, men who had not signed the articles had a much better chance of [[acquittal]] at [[trial]] if captured by the law.

Pirate articles are closely related to, and were derived from, ship's articles of the time, especially those of [[privateering|privateers]], which similarly provided for discipline and regulated distribution of booty (though usually far less equally than with pirate articles).&lt;ref&gt;See the Articles of the privateer ship ''Mars'', at http://pirates.hegewisch.net/articles_new.html#privateer&lt;/ref&gt;  Merchant articles and privateering articles can be traced back to Europe in the Middle Ages when there was a system of "joint hands" agreements between merchants, owners and seamen to share profits.&lt;ref name = "Hayes"&gt;Hayes, Peter (2008), "Pirates, Privateers and the Contract Theories of Hobbes and Locke", ''History of Political Thought'' '''24''', 3: 461-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Nine complete or nearly complete sets of piratical articles have survived, chiefly from [[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Charles Johnson]]'s ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'', first published in 1724, and from records kept by [[Admiralty Court]] proceedings at the trials of pirates&lt;ref name="Fox Dissertation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=E.

A partial code from [[Henry Morgan]] is preserved in [[Alexandre Exquemelin]]'s 1678 book ''The Buccaneers of America''. Many other pirates are known to have had articles; the late-17th century Articles of [[George Cusack]] and [[Nicholas Clough]] have survived intact. Few pirate articles have survived; pirates on the verge of capture or surrender usually burned their articles or threw them overboard to prevent the papers being used against them at trial&lt;ref name="Fox Dissertation" /&gt;.

===Captain Bartholomew Roberts's articles===
{{quote|
'''I.''' Every man has a vote in affairs of moment; has equal title to the fresh provisions, or strong liquors, at any time seized, and may use them at pleasure, unless a scarcity (not an uncommon thing among them) makes it necessary, for the good of all, to vote a retrenchment.

'''II.''' Every man to be called fairly in turn, by list, on board of prizes because, (over and above their proper share) they were on these occasions allowed a shift of clothes: but if they defrauded the company to the value of a dollar in plate, jewels, or money, [[marooning]] was their punishment. If the robbery was only betwixt one another, they contented themselves with slitting the ears and nose of him that was guilty, and set him on shore, not in an uninhabited place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter hardships.

'''III.''' No person to game at cards or dice for money.

'''IV.''' The lights and candles to be put out at eight o'clock at night: if any of the crew, after that hour still remained inclined for drinking, they were to do it on the open deck.

'''V.''' To keep their piece, pistols, and cutlass clean and fit for service.

'''VI.''' No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them. If any man were to be found seducing any of the latter sex, and carried her to sea, disguised, he was to suffer death; (so that when any fell into their hands, as it chanced in the Onslow, they put a sentinel immediately over her to prevent ill consequences from so dangerous an instrument of division and quarrel; but then here lies the roguery; they contend who shall be sentinel, which happens generally to one of the greatest bullies, who, to secure the lady's virtue, will let none lie with her but himself.)

'''VII.''' To desert the ship or their quarters in battle, was punished with death or marooning.

'''VIII.''' No striking one another on board, but every man's quarrels to be ended on shore, at sword and pistol. (The quarter-master of the ship, when the parties will not come to any reconciliation, accompanies them on shore with what assistance he thinks proper, and turns the disputant back to back, at so many paces distance; at the word of command, they turn and fire immediately (or else the piece is knocked out of their hands). If both miss, they come to their cutlasses, and then he is declared the victor who draws the first blood.)

'''IX.''' No man to talk of breaking up their way of living, till each had shared one thousand pounds. If in order to this, any man should lose a limb, or become a cripple in their service, he was to have eight hundred dollars, out of the public stock, and for lesser hurts, proportionately.

'''X.''' The [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] and [[Quartermaster]] to receive two shares of a prize: the [[master (naval)|master]], [[boatswain]], and [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]], one share and a half, and other officers one and quarter.

'''XI.''' The musicians to have rest on the Sabbath Day, but the other six days and nights, none without special favour.
}}

===Captain John Phillips's articles===
Captain [[John Phillips (pirate)|John Phillips]], captain of the ''Revenge'', also set a code for his men in 1724:
{{quote|
'''I.'''   Every Man Shall obey civil Command; the [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] shall have one full Share and a half of all Prizes; the [[Master (naval)|Master]], [[Carpenter]], [[Boatswain]] and [[Gunner (rank)|Gunner]] shall have one Share and quarter.

'''II.'''   If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from the Company, he shall be [[marooning|marooned]] with one Bottle of Powder, one Bottle of Water, one small Arm, and Shot.

'''III.'''  If any Man shall steal any Thing in the Company, or game, to the Value of a [[Spanish dollar|Piece of Eight]], he shall be marooned or shot.

'''IV.'''  If any time we shall meet another Marooner that Man shall sign his Articles without the Consent of our Company, shall suffer such Punishment as the Captain and Company shall think fit.

'''V.'''   That Man that shall strike another whilst these Articles are in force, shall receive Moses’ Law (that is, 40 Stripes lacking one) on the bare Back.

'''VI.'''   That Man that shall snap his Arms, or smoke [[Tobacco]] in the Hold, without a Cap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted without a [[Lanthorn]], shall suffer the same Punishment as in the former Article.

'''VII.'''  That Man shall not keep his Arms clean, fit for an Engagement, or neglect his Business, shall be cut off from his Share, and suffer such other Punishment as the Captain and the Company shall think fit.

'''VIII.'''  If any Man shall lose a Joint in time of an Engagement, shall have 400 Pieces of Eight ; if a Limb, 800.

'''IX.'''    If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer present Death.
}}

===Articles of Edward Low and George Lowther===
The articles listed below are attributed by the ''[[Boston News-Letter]]'' to Captain [[Edward Low]].  The first eight of these articles are essentially identical to those attributed to pirate captain [[George Lowther (pirate)|George Lowther]] by Charles Johnson.  Since Lowther and Low are known to have sailed together from about [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] to May 28, 1722, it is probable that both reports are correct and that Low and Lowther shared the same articles, with Low's two extra articles being an ''ordinance'', or amendment, adopted after the two crews separated.
{{quote|
'''I.''' The Captain is to have two full Shares; the Quartermaster is to have one Share and one Half; The Doctor, Mate, Gunner and Boatswain, one Share and one Quarter.

'''II.''' He that shall be found guilty of taking up any Unlawful Weapon on Board the Privateer or any other prize by us taken, so as to Strike or Abuse one another in any regard, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall see fit.

'''III.''' He that shall be found Guilty of Cowardice in the time of engagements, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit.

'''IV.''' If any Gold, Jewels, Silver, &amp;c. be found on Board of any Prize or Prizes to the value of a Piece of Eight, &amp; the finder do not deliver it to the Quarter Master in the space of 24 hours he shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit.

'''V.''' He that is found Guilty of Gaming, or Defrauding one another to the value of a Royal of Plate, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit.

'''VI.''' He that shall have the Misfortune to lose a Limb in time of Engagement, shall have the Sum of Six hundred pieces of Eight, and remain aboard as long as he shall think fit.

'''VII.''' Good Quarters to be given when Craved.

'''VIII.''' He that sees a Sail first, shall have the best Pistol or Small Arm aboard of her.

'''IX.''' He that shall be guilty of Drunkenness in time of Engagement shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the Company shall think fit.

'''X.''' No snapping of Guns in the Hold.
}}

===Articles of John Gow===
A set of articles written in [[John Gow]]'s own hand was found aboard his ship, the ''Revenge'' (née ''George''), in 1729.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng182.htm The Newgate Calendar - JOHN GOW] Accessed 16 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;   Article IV's reference to no going ashore "till the ship is off the ground" suggests that the ''Revenge'' was already grounded when the articles were written, only days before Gow and his men were captured.  The code states as follows:
{{quote|
'''I.''' That every man shall obey his commander in all respects, as if the ship was his own, and as if he received monthly wages.

'''II.''' That no man shall give, or dispose of, the ship's provisions; but every one shall have an equal share.

'''III.''' That no man shall open, or declare to any person or persons, who they are, or what designs they are upon; and any persons so offending shall be punished with immediate death.

'''IV.''' That no man shall go on shore till the ship is off the ground, and in readiness to put to sea.

'''V.''' That every man shall keep his watch night and day; and at the hour of eight in the evening every one shall retire from gaming and drinking, in order to attend his respective station.

'''VI.''' Every person who shall offend against any of these articles shall be punished with death, or in such other manner as the ship's company shall think proper.
}}

===Articles of Henry Morgan and other buccaneers===
[[Alexandre Exquemelin|Exquemelin]] writes in general terms about the articles of late 17th century Caribbean buccaneers. Although he does not attribute these articles to any specific buccaneer captain, Exquemelin almost certainly sailed with [[Henry Morgan]] as a physician, and thus his account likely reflects Morgan's articles more accurately than any other privateer or buccaneer of the time.

Exquemelin writes that the buccaneers "agree on certain articles, which are put in writing, by way of bond or obligation, which every one is bound to observe, and all of them, or the chief, set their hands to it." Although Exquemelin does not number the articles, the following approximately reflects his description of the buccaneers' laws:
{{quote|
'''I.''' The fund of all payments under the articles is the stock of what is gotten by the expedition, following the same law as other pirates, that is, [[No prey, no pay]].

'''II.''' Compensation is provided the Captain for the use of his ship, and the salary of the carpenter, or shipwright, who mended, careened, and rigged the vessel (the latter usually about 150 pieces of eight). A sum for provisions and victuals is specified, usually 200 pieces of eight. A salary and compensation is specified for the surgeon and his medicine chest, usually 250 pieces of eight.

'''III.''' A standard compensation is provided for maimed and mutilated buccaneers. "Thus they order for the loss of a right arm six hundred pieces of eight, or six slaves ; for the loss of a left arm five hundred pieces of eight, or five slaves ; for a right leg five hundred pieces of eight, or five slaves ; for the left leg four hundred pieces of eight, or four slaves ; for an eye one hundred pieces of eight, or one slave ; for a finger of the hand the same reward as for the eye.

'''IV.''' Shares of booty are provided as follows: "the Captain, or chief Commander, is allotted five or six portions to what the ordinary seamen have ; the Master's Mate only two ; and Officers proportionate to their employment. After whom they draw equal parts from the highest even to the lowest mariner, the boys not being omitted. For even these draw half a share, by reason that, when they happen to take a better vessel than their own, it is the duty of the boys to set fire to the ship or boat wherein they are, and then retire to the prize which they have taken."

'''V.''' "In the prizes they take, it is severely prohibited to every one to usurp anything, in particular to themselves. ... Yea, they make a solemn oath to each other not to abscond, or conceal the least thing they find amongst the prey. If afterwards any one is found unfaithful, who has contravened the said oath, immediately he is separated and turned out of the society."

'''Relationship anarchy''' (sometimes abbreviated '''RA''') is the belief that relationships should not be bound by rules aside from what the people involved mutually agree upon. If a relationship [[anarchism|anarchist]] has multiple intimate partners, it might be considered as a form of [[polyamory]], but distinguishes itself by postulating that there need not be a formal distinction between sexual, romantic, or platonic relationships.

Relationship anarchists look at each relationship ([[Romance (love)|romantic]], [[Platonic love|platonic]] or otherwise) individually, as opposed to categorizing them according to societal norms such as 'just friends', 'in a relationship', or 'in an [[open relationship]]'. 

The term ''relationship anarchy'' was coined by Andie Nordgren,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Anapol | first = Deborah | authorlink = Deborah Anapol | year = 2010 | title = Polyamory in the 21st Century: Love and Intimacy with Multiple Partners | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the topic of Swedish bachelor theses by Jacob Strandell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/1976250 |title=Det fria subjektets diskurs: en analys av de diskurser som möjliggör relationsanarkins diskurs och praktik. |year=2011 |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ida Midnattssol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:611909 |title=Ett relationsanarkistiskt ställningstagande - en undersökning av subjektspositionering inom relationsanarki. |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discussed in workshops at OpenCon 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polytical.org/2011/10/so-whats-opencon-all-about-then/ |title=So what’s OpenCon all about, then? |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Senior [[Open University]] lecturer [[Meg-John Barker|Dr Meg-John Barker]] in a presentation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Barker | first = Meg |url=http://prezi.com/gctn6wf3bmsb/rewriting-the-rules-nonmonogamies/ |title=Rewriting the Rules: Non/monogamies |date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship anarchy movement has its roots in the [[free love]] movement of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Relationship Anarchy Basics|url = https://thethinkingasexual.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/relationship-anarchy-basics/|website = The Thinking Aro|access-date = 2016-01-26|first = The Thinking|last = Asexual}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in some forms rejected the idea of monogamous marriage, seeing it as a form of social and financial bondage.

'''Robert C. Stalnaker''' (born 1940) is an American [[philosopher]], who is Laurence S. Rockefeller Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/robert-stalnaker-profile-0320 |title=Philosopher Robert Stalnaker solves problems the MIT way &amp;#124; MIT News |website=Newsoffice.mit.edu |date=2015-03-20 |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/sections/index.cfm?member=24669 |title=Sections - British Academy |website=Britac.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206181729/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/sections/index.cfm?member=24669 |archivedate=2016-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
He earned his BA from [[Wesleyan University]] and earned his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]] in 1965. His thesis advisor was [[Stuart Hampshire]], though he was strongly influenced by another faculty member, [[Carl Hempel]]. Stalnaker taught briefly at Yale University and the University of Illinois, and then for many years at the Sage School of Philosophy at [[Cornell University]] before joining the MIT faculty in 1988.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  He retired from MIT in 2016.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  His many students include [[Jason Stanley]], Zoltan Szabo and [[Delia Graff Fara]].

In 2007, Stalnaker delivered the [[John Locke Lectures]] at [[Oxford University]] on the topic of "Our Knowledge of the Internal World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/misc/johnlocke/index.shtml |title=John Locke Lectures - Faculty of Philosophy |website=Philosophy.ox.ac.uk |date=2015-09-21 |accessdate=2016-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829191222/http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/misc/johnlocke/index.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, in May 2017, he delivered the Casalegno Lectures at the [[University of Milan]] on "Counterfactuals and Practical Reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filosofia.unimi.it/fl/index.php/casalegno-lectures/2017-robert-stalnaker |title=Casalegno Lectures - La Statale |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
His work concerns, among other things, the philosophical foundations of [[semantics]], [[pragmatics]], philosophical logic, [[decision theory]], [[game theory]], the theory of [[Conditional sentence|conditional]]s, [[epistemology]], and the [[philosophy of mind]]. But all of these interests are in the service of addressing the problem of intentionality, "what it is to represent the world in both speech and thought".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyke-eye.com/view/phil_II_19.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229025239/http://www.pyke-eye.com/view/phil_II_19.html |date=December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, he seeks to provide a naturalistic account of intentionality, characterizing representation in terms of causal and modal notions.

Along with [[Saul Kripke]], [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], and [[Alvin Plantinga]], Stalnaker has been one of the most influential theorists exploring philosophical aspects of [[possible world semantics]]. According to his view of possible worlds, they are ways this world could have been, which in turn are maximal properties that this world could have had. This view distinguishes him from the influential modal realist Lewis, who argued that possible worlds are concrete entities just like this world.&lt;ref&gt;Stalnaker 2003; pp 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his contributions to the metaphysics of possible worlds, he has used the apparatus of possible worlds semantics to explore many issues in the semantics of natural language, including counterfactual and indicative conditionals, and presupposition. His view of assertion as narrowing the conversational common ground to exclude situations in which the asserted content is false was a major impetus in recent developments in semantics and pragmatics, in particular, the so-called "dynamic" turn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jarda.peregrin.cz/mybibl/PDFTxt/238.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225112818/http://jarda.peregrin.cz/mybibl/PDFTxt/238.pdf |date=February 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalnaker is the author of four books and dozens of articles in major philosophical journals.

[[File:Roberto Ardigò.jpg|thumb|200px|Roberto Ardigò]]
'''Roberto Felice Ardigò''' (28 January 1828 – 15 September 1920) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] philosopher. He was an influential leader of Italian [[positivism]] and a former [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]].

Ardigò was born in [[Casteldidone]], in what is now the [[province of Cremona]], in [[Lombardy]], and trained for the priesthood. He resigned from the Church in 1871 after abandoning theology and faith in 1869. He was appointed as a professor of theology at the [[University of Padua]] in 1881, at a time when a reaction to idealism had taken place in philosophical circles.

Inspired by [[Auguste Comte]], Ardigò differed from Comte in that he considered thought more important than matter and insisted on psychological disquisition. He believed thought was dominant in every action and the result of every action, and that it disappears only in a state of general corruption.

He died by suicide at [[Mantua]] in 1920, at the age of 92.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''Sheldon Krimsky''' is Professor of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning at [[Tufts University]], and adjunct professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at [[Tufts University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org "Council for Responsible Genetics"], Board of Directors. Accessed June 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fellow of the [[Hastings Center]], an independent [[bioethics]] research institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/About/Default.aspx?id=902 The Hastings Center] Hastings Center Fellows.

Krimsky received his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from [[Brooklyn College]] and [[Purdue University]] respectively, and a masters and doctorate in philosophy at [[Boston University]].

== Work ==

=== ''Science in the Private Interest'' ===
In his 2003 book ''Science in the Private Interest'', Krimsky points out that conflicts of interests are perceived and regulated very differently in public affairs and in science:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The prophylactic measures that are taken to prevent conflict of interest in public affairs are considered irrelevant in science precisely because scientists view themselves as participating in a higher calling than that of public officials—namely, the pursuit of objective knowledge. While senior public officials (elected or appointed) are prohibited from managing their portfolios during their tenure in office, scientists with patents and equity in companies that fund their research are at most simply asked to disclose their interests.{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|130}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Krimsky raises the concern that conflicts of interest may compromise the scientific norm of "disinterestedness", which "requires that scientists apply the methods, perform the analysis, and execute the interpretation of results without considerations of personal gain, ideology, or fidelity to any cause other than the pursuit of truth."{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|77}} He claims that blurred boundaries between public interest science and pursuit of private gain have severely compromised the integrity of university science:&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolving academic universe is no longer as nurturing an environment for public-interest science as it once was. To a large degree, universities have been taken over by money managers and academic entrepreneurs who are looking for financially lucrative research.{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|79}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Krimsky writes that the profit motive has corrupted many scientists in biomedical research. He also proposes that the relationships between corporations, universities, and government agencies have resulted in biased science that puts human health and environment at risk. He has written and commented on [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified foods]], [[water fluoridation]], [[environmental health]], [[global warming]], and other controversial topics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/23/science/a-conversation-with-sheldon-krimsky-uncoupling-campus-and-company.html A Conversation With: Sheldon Krimsky; Uncoupling Campus and Company], by Melody Petersen.

The '''Society for Developmental Biology''' ('''SDB''') is a professional society for basic scientists and physicians around the world whose [[research]] is focused on the study of the [[developmental biology]] and [[embryology]].

== History ==
The Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) was founded in 1939 to promote the field of developmental biology and to advance the understanding of developmental biology at all levels. SDB is a non-profit professional society dedicated to advancement of the field of developmental biology. Over recent decades, the SDB has grown  to nearly 2000 members, and has evolved to provide an international forum for research, education and career development in developmental biology.

The stated [[mission statement|mission]] of the society is to:
#Foster excellence in research and education in developmental biology.
#Provide advice and resources on careers in developmental biology.
#Provide information for the public on relevant topics in developmental biology.
#Provide a communication hub for all developmental biologists.

The Society is associated with the monthly [[peer review]]ed [[Scientific journal|journal]], ''[[Developmental Biology]]''.

== Awards ==
The Society for Developmental Biology inaugurated the [[Edwin Grant Conklin Medal]] in 1995 to honor the biologist [[Edwin Conklin]].&lt;ref name = "EGC medal"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sdbonline.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8 |title = Edwin Grant Conklin Medal |publisher = Society for Developmental Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] was begun in 2000. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for Developmental Biology Lifetime Achievement Award|url=http://www.sdbonline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=50|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual Meeting ==
The Society holds an annual meeting that is attended by scientists from around the world. The 68th annual meeting in 2009 will be held in [[San Francisco, CA]]. In addition to the annual meetings, specific regions around the U.S. hold regional meetings.

=== Past Meetings ===
The first symposium on Development and Growth was sponsored by the editors of [[Growth (magazine)|Growth]], and it was held in August 1939, at North Truro. Subsequent meetings have been held in a variety of cities throughout the world. A selection of recent meetings are summarized in the table. More information about future and past annual meetings are posted on the Society's official website [http://www.sdbonline.org/].

'''''Soham or Sohum''''' ({{lang|sa|सो ऽहम्}} ''{{IAST|so 'ham or so 'Hum}}''&lt;ref&gt;In English language literature also printed as ''So’ham'', ''So Ham'', ''So-aham'', ''Sohum'', ''So Hum'', ''Saham'', ''Sa'ham'', ''Sau-ha'', ''Sah-karena/Sahkara'' = the sound of Sa&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[mantra]], meaning "I am He/That" in [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=80-81, 210 with footnotes}}&lt;ref name=dhavamonyhs129&gt;Mariasusai Dhavamony (1999), Hindu Spirituality, GB Press, {{ISBN|978-8876528187}}, page 129&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vedic philosophy]] it means identifying oneself with the universe or ultimate reality.{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=80-81, 210 with footnotes}}

The mantra is also inverted from  ''{{IAST|so 'ham}}'' (the [[sandhi]] of ''{{IAST|saḥ + aham}}'') to ''{{IAST|ham + sa}}''. The combination of ''{{IAST|so 'haṃ  haṃsaḥ}}'' has also been interpreted as "I myself am the [[Hamsa (bird)|Swan]]", where the swan symbolizes the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alper|first=Harvey P.|title=Understanding Mantras|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|year=1991|isbn=978-81-208-0746-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
An etymology of ''{{IAST|haṃsa}}'' "swan, goose" as from ''{{IAST|ahaṃ sa}}'' "I am that" is found in the 14th century commentary on the Vedas by [[Sayana]] (14th century).&lt;ref&gt;[[Monier-Williams]], s.v. "{{IAST|haṃsa}}".&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''{{IAST|so'ham}}'' is related to {{IAST|sa}}, and the phrase translates to "I that very person", according to [[Monier-Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier Williams Dictionary, ''Sa'' s.v. " 6.":  "it is often for emphasis connected with another pron. as with ''{{IAST|aham}}'', ''{{IAST|tvam}}'', ''{{IAST|eṣa}}'', ''{{IAST|ayam}}''&amp;c. (e.g. ''{{IAST|so'ham}}'', ''{{IAST|satvam}}'', 'I (or thou) that very person'"&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreted as a [[nominal sentence]], it can also be read as "I am he" or "It/He is I".{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=80-81, 210 with footnotes}}&lt;ref name=dhavamonyhs129/&gt; The term is found in Vedic literature, and is a phrase that identifies "oneself with the universe or ultimate reality".{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=80-81, 210 with footnotes}}

== History ==

This phrase is found in [[Principal Upanishads]] such as the [[Isha Upanishad]] (verse 16), which ends:

: (...) तेजो यत्ते रूपं कल्याणतमं तत्ते पश्यामि योऽसावसौ पुरुषः '''सोऽहमस्मि''' ॥१६॥
: ''{{IAST|tejo yat te rūpaṃ kalyāṇatamaṃ tat te paśyāmi yo 'sāv [asau puruṣaḥ] &lt;u&gt;so'ham asmi&lt;/u&gt;}}''
: "The light which is thy fairest form, I see it. &lt;u&gt;I am what He is&lt;/u&gt;" (trans. [[Max Müller]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe01/sbe01243.htm The Upanishads, Part 1] 1879, p. 313. Müller gives the footnote: "Asau purushah should probably be omitted", taking these words as an explanatory gloss that was accidentally incorporated in the text.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soham, or "I am He", is very common in ancient and medieval literature.{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=80-81}} Some examples include:

The teaching of '''''Ham''''' on inhalation and '''''sa''''' on exhalation is allegedly alluded to in a text of [[Kaśmir Śaivism]], the ''[[Vijnana Bhairava]]'':

==Yoga==
When used for meditation, "Sohum" acts as a [[Nature|natural]] [[mantra]] to control one's breathing pattern, to help achieve deep breath, and to gain concentration.

* ''Sooooo...'' is the sound of inhalation, and is remembered in the mind along with that inhalation.
* ''Hummmm...'' is the sound of exhalation, and is remembered in the mind along with that exhalation.

Soham is also considered a [[mantra]] in [[Tantrism]] and [[Kriya Yoga]], known also as ''Ajapa mantra'', ''Ajapa Gayatri'', ''Hamsa Gayatri'', ''Hamsa mantra'', ''prana mantra'', ''Shri Paraprasada mantra'', ''paramatma-mantra'', and as such used notably on its own, in the [[meditation]] practice [[ajapa japa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Satyananda Saraswati|title=Yoga and Kriya: A Systematic Course in the Ancient Tantric Techniques of|publisher=Bihar School of Yoga|location=Munger, Bihar, India|year=1989|edition=2|isbn=978-81-85787-08-4|page=497 ff|quote=Listen carefully to your breath; you will hear the sound ''So'' with inhalation and ''Ham'' with exhalation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[kriya]] practice shabda sanchalana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Satyananda Saraswati|title=Yoga and Kriya: A Systematic Course in the Ancient Tantric Techniques of|publisher=Bihar School of Yoga|location=Munger, Bihar, India|year=1989|edition=2|isbn=978-81-85787-08-4|page=668 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris accepts that investigation of truth involves considerable effort, with no guarantee of reaching the absolute truth, and that knowledge can be attained "through reason, through observation, through investigation, through thought, through science".&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;

In a piece for the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]], [[Philip Kitcher]] compared Morris' critique to [[Samuel Johnson]]'s [[appeal to the stone]] regarding [[George Berkeley]]'s belief in [[subjective idealism]], stating that "Morris has no interest in considering what Kuhn might have had in mind", and rejecting his characterisation of Kuhn as a relativist and an [[Irrealism (philosophy)|irrealist]].&lt;ref name=kitcher /&gt;

==Title==
In 1972, Morris met with Kuhn at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Institute for Advanced Study]], where Morris was a graduate student and Kuhn was his academic adviser, to discuss a paper Morris had written. The conversation grew increasingly heated as they disagreed regarding some fundamental ideas - specifically regarding [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s theory of [[displacement current]], and the concept of [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]] - and eventually Kuhn threw a cut glass ashtray full of cigarette butts. Following the incident Morris left Princeton. Morris uses the ashtray as a metaphor for the [[Materialism|material reality]] that Morris believes Kuhn denied, as well what Morris views as Kuhn's intolerance of dissent from his theories.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/06/errol-morris-book-about-thomas-kuhn-the-ashtray-reviewed.html|title=Errol Morris Refutes It Thus |last=Miller |first=Laura |author-link=Laura Miller (writer) |date=5 June 2018|website=[[Slate (magazine)]] |access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mm /&gt;&lt;ref name=kitcher /&gt;&lt;ref name=ashtray /&gt;

'''''The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology: An Introduction to Phenomenological Philosophy''''' ({{lang-de|Die Krisis der europäischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale Phänomenologie: Eine Einleitung in die phänomenologische Philosophie}}) is an unfinished 1936 book by the German philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]],&lt;ref name="Inwood"&gt;[[#Inw05|Inwood 2005]]. p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author attempts to provide a historical and causal account of human consciousness. The work is seen as the culmination of Husserl's thought.

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on a secondary source discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Husserl purports to show, "by way of a teleological-historical reflection on the origins of our critical scientific and philosophical situation, the inescapable necessity of a transcendental-phenomenological reorientation of [[philosophy]]". He attempts to provide a historical and causal account of the origins of consciousness, something excluded or "bracketed" in his earlier works. Husserl, now concerned not so much with particular past events as with the ''eidos'' of history, the essential historicity of consciousness and its burden of preoccupations derived from the traditions of its social milieu, casts doubt on his own attempt to found a rigorous science free of all preconceptions. In the third part of the book, he develops the concept of the "[[Lifeworld|life-world]]" (''Lebenswelt'') the intersubjective world of natural, pre-theoretical experience and activity, which in his view was neglected by philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] in favor of the world of theoretical science. The "theoretical attitude", exemplified for Husserl by [[Galileo Galilei]], arose historically, in [[ancient Greece]], against the background of the life-world, which essentially persists even after the development of the theoretical spirit.&lt;ref name="Inwood" /&gt;

==Reception==
''The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'' has been seen as the culmination of Husserl's thought.&lt;ref name="Welton"&gt;[[#Wel89|Welton 1989]]. p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Inwood notes that, though Husserl's account of the life-world, its essential priority to theory and theory's emergence from it, owes something to the eideitic method and to ''epochē'' (describing the essential structures of the life-world involves suspending scientific presuppositions and our practical engagement with the life-world), some philosophers, including [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], considered ''The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'' a significant departure from Husserl's earlier work. He believes that unlike the books that Husserl wrote earlier in his career, which were avowedly similar to the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641) of [[René Descartes]] and unavowedly similar to [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge]]'' (1794), ''The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'' is close in spirit to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807).&lt;ref name="Inwood" /&gt;

Others have argued (D. Carr 1970), however, that the pressure set onto his project of pure phenomenology by the rise of existentialist phenomenology and equally socio-cultural developments of Germany in the early thirties changed Husserl's priorities and forced him to try a new approach to reach his audience. In this respect, ''The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'' is not the culmination of his phenomenological project per se, but moreover a book of phenomenological philosophy, contrasted with phenomenology as a science. For instance, in 1938, Husserl's ''Experience and Judgment'' was published, a book dealing much more explicitly with themes that concerned Husserl in his earlier periods, most notably the task of a transcendental phenomenological logic. As a consequence of this, it is not at all undisputed whether themes and methodology of ''The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'' contradicts or constitutes a departure from Husserl's earlier views on phenomenology.

Some researches utilized Husserl's Crisis as a starting point in order to show how other disciplines, e.g. [[mainstream economics]], shared the crisis of modern sciences. In this respect, mainstream economics is a special case, since economic theory, taking physics as an ideal to follow and mimic, somehow inherited the methodological problems, the attitudes and the aspirations of natural sciences. In Husserl’s view, the crisis of modern sciences was caused by their efforts to mathematize our life-world. It can be argued, citing the classical texts, that [[neoclassical economics]] did not try to apply this aspectual misinterpretation. Although its methodology became similar to [[Galileo]]’s physics and shared the faith in [[mechanical philosophy]], it should be realized that Neoclassicals did not substitute the abstract world to be scientifically investigated for directly experienced reality. According to these texts, early Neoclassicals pursued their studies deliberately assuming abstract environment and elements differing from reality. However, under the evolution of mainstream theory, its relation to reality underwent a peculiar rearrangement in which the total and direct merging of directly experienced reality and mathematical models into each other emerged only as a relatively late development, implemented by [[new classical macroeconomics]], but the imperative of it was present all along. This was the way, as it is argued, how Husserlian scientific crisis emerged in economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbács |first=Peter |chapter=Methodological Principles and an Epistemological Introduction |pages=1–52 |title= The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics.

'''''The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism''''' is a 1975 book by [[physicist]] [[Fritjof Capra]]. It was a bestseller in the United States and has been published in 43 editions in 23 languages. The fourth edition in English was published in 2000.

==Origin==
The following excerpt from ''The Tao of Physics'' summarizes Capra's motivation for writing this book

'''“Science does not need mysticism and mysticism does not need science. But man needs both.”'''

According to the preface of the first edition, reprinted in subsequent editions, Capra struggled to reconcile [[theoretical physics]] and [[Eastern mysticism]] and was at first "helped on my way by 'power plants'" or [[psychedelics]], with the first experience "so overwhelming that I burst into tears, at the same time, not unlike [[Carlos Castaneda|Castaneda]], pouring out my impressions to a piece of paper". (p.&amp;nbsp;12, 4th ed.)

Capra later discussed his ideas with [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1972, as he mentioned in the following interview excerpt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had several discussions with Heisenberg. I lived in England then [circa 1972], and I visited him several times in Munich and showed him the whole manuscript chapter by chapter. He was very interested and very open, and he told me something that I think is not known publicly because he never published it. He said that he was well aware of these parallels. While he was working on quantum theory he went to India to lecture and was a guest of [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]]. He talked a lot with Tagore about Indian philosophy. Heisenberg told me that these talks had helped him a lot with his work in physics, because they showed him that all these new ideas in quantum physics were in fact not all that crazy. He realized there was, in fact, a whole culture that subscribed to very similar ideas. Heisenberg said that this was a great help for him. [[Niels Bohr]] had a similar experience when he went to China.&lt;ref&gt;Fritjof Capra, interviewed by Renee Weber in the book ''The Holographic Paradigm'', Shambhala/Random House. 1982. pages 217–218. {{ISBN|0-394-71237-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result of those influences, Bohr adopted the [[yin yang]] symbol as part of his family [[coat of arms]] when he was [[knight]]ed in 1947.

''The Tao of Physics'' was followed by other books of the same genre like ''The Hidden Connection'', ''[[The Turning Point (book)|The Turning Point]]'' and ''The Web of Life'' in which Capra extended the argument of how [[Eastern mysticism]] and scientific findings of today relate, and how Eastern mysticism might also have answers to some of the biggest scientific challenges of today.

==Acclaim and criticism==
The book was a best seller in the United States. However, it is not without its critics. It received a positive review from [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A brilliant best-seller.... Lucidly analyzes the tenets of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism to show their striking parallels with the latest discoveries in cyclotrons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Victor N. Mansfield]], a professor of physics and astronomy at [[Colgate University]] who wrote many papers and books of his own connecting physics to [[Buddhism]] and also to [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vic Mansfield |publisher=Templeton Press |url=https://www.templetonpress.org/author/vic-mansfield |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; complimented ''The Tao of Physics'' in ''[[Physics Today]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shambhala.com/html/catalog/items/isbn/978-1-57062-519-0.cfm |accessdate=April 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009034952/http://www.shambhala.com/html/catalog/items/isbn/978-1-57062-519-0.cfm |title=An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism |archivedate=October 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tao Of Physics (3rd Edition-Updated) Paperback – August 13, 1991 |publisher=Amazon.com |url= https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Physics-3rd-Updated/dp/0877735948 |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Fritjof Capra, in ''The Tao of Physics'', seeks ... an integration of the mathematical world view of modern physics and the mystical visions of [[Buddha]] and [[Krishna]]. Where others have failed miserably in trying to unite these seemingly different world views, Capra, a high-energy theorist, has succeeded admirably. I strongly recommend the book to both layman and scientist."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jeremy Bernstein]], a professor of physics at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeremy Bernstein |publisher=Edge |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/bernstein.html |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; chastised ''The Tao of Physics'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jeremy Bernstein]] |year=1982 |title=Science Observed |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-07340-9 |pages=333–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the heart of the matter is Mr. Capra's methodology – his use of what seem to me to be accidental similarities of language as if these were somehow evidence of deeply rooted connections. Thus I agree with Capra when he writes, "Science does not need mysticism and mysticism does not need science but man needs both." What no one needs, in my opinion, is this superficial and profoundly misleading book.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Leon M. Lederman]], a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and current Director Emeritus of [[Fermilab]], criticized both ''The Tao of Physics'' and [[Gary Zukav]]'s ''[[The Dancing Wu Li Masters]]'' in his 1993 book ''[[The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Leon Lederman]] |year=1993 |title=The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question? |location=New York |publisher=Bantam Doubleday |isbn=0-385-31211-3  |pages=189–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Starting with reasonable descriptions of quantum physics, he constructs elaborate extensions, totally bereft of the understanding of how carefully experiment and theory are woven together and how much blood, sweat, and tears go into each painful advance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosopher of science [[Eric Scerri]] criticizes both Capra and Zukav and similar books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Eric R. Scerri]] |title=Eastern Mysticism and the Alleged Parallels with Physics |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=687–692 |year=1989 |doi=10.1119/1.15921|bibcode = 1989AmJPh..57..687S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Woit]], a [[mathematical physics|mathematical physicist]] at [[Columbia University]], criticized Capra for continuing to build his case for physics-mysticism parallels on the [[bootstrap model]] of [[Strong interaction|strong-force]] interactions, long after the [[Standard Model]] had become thoroughly accepted by physicists as a better model:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Peter Woit]] |year=2006 |title=Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-09275-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcJA3i0xKAUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Tao of Physics'' was completed in December 1974, and the implications of the [[November Revolution (physics)|November Revolution]] one month earlier that led to the dramatic confirmations of the standard-model quantum field theory clearly had not sunk in for Capra (like many others at that time). What is harder to understand is that the book has now gone through several editions, and in each of them Capra has left intact the now out-of-date physics, including new forewords and afterwords that with a straight face deny what has happened. The foreword to the second edition of 1983 claims, "It has been very gratifying for me that none of these recent developments has invalidated anything I wrote seven years ago. In fact, most of them were anticipated in the original edition," a statement far from any relation to the reality that in 1983 the standard model was nearly universally accepted in the physics community, and the bootstrap theory was a dead idea ... Even now, Capra's book, with its nutty denials of what has happened in particle theory, can be found selling well at every major bookstore. It has been joined by some other books on the same topic, most notably Gary Zukav's ''[[The Dancing Wu Li Masters|The Dancing Wu-Li Masters]]''. The bootstrap philosophy, despite its complete failure as a physical theory, lives on as part of an embarrassing New Age cult, with its followers refusing to acknowledge what has happened.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1910">'''Ulrich Libbrecht''' (10 July 1928, [[Avelgem]] – 15 May 2017) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] philosopher and author in the field of comparative philosophy. His magnum opus consists of four books in Dutch - called "Introduction to Comparative Philosophy".  

An abbreviated version of these works in English, entitled "Within the Four Seas..." was published by Peeters Ed. (Leuven, 2007) This book explains how a comparative model, based on the paradigm-free axes of energy and information, accommodates the current world-views of Taoism, Buddhism and Rationalism – representing the Chinese, Indian and Western heritage - and shows how science and religion interrelate within such a global framework.

Prof. dr. Ulrich Libbrecht was an authority in the field of Eastern and Comparative philosophy. He studied sinology in Gent, graduated cum laude in 1972 at the University of Leiden (R.U. Leiden) and that same year became a professor in sinology, Chinese philosophy and buddhology at the University of Leuven. He also founded the School for Comparative Philosophy in Antwerp (Belgium) and School Philosophy East-West in Utrecht (Netherlands). 

Ulrich Libbrecht died on 15 May 2017, in the Belgian town of [[Ronse]]. No cause of death was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20170516_02884971|title=Ereburger Ulrich Libbrecht overleden|last=Malaise|first=Peter|date=17 May 2017|website=Het Nieuwsblad|language=nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2187">'''Walter of Mortagne''' (b. Mortagne, [[Flanders]], c. 1100; d. [[Laon]], 1174) was a [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[philosopher]], and [[theologian]].

Mortagne was educated in the schools of [[Tournai]]. Between 1136 and 1144 he taught at the School of St [[Genevieve]] in [[Paris]]. From Paris he went to Laon and was made [[bishop]] of that [[Episcopal see|see]]. His principal works are a treatise on the [[Holy Trinity]] and six "Opuscula". Of the "Opuscula" five are published in [[Lucas d'Achéry]]'s "Spicilegium" (Paris, 1723) and the sixth in P.L. (CLXXXVI, 1052). A logical commentary which is contained in MS. 17813 of the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] and which was published in part by [[Barthélemy Hauréau]] in 1892 is also ascribed to him. Finally, there is extant a letter written by him to [[Abelard]], in which he expounds the [[Plato]]nic view that the body is an obstacle to the higher operations and aspirations of the soul.

On the question of universals, Walter, according to [[John of Salisbury]], was the leader of the [[Indifferentist]]s, according to whom the universal is in itself indifferent, but becomes the predicate of an individual subject by the addition of various status, that is determinations or, at least, points of view. [[Socrates]], for example, is an individual, a [[species]] (man), or a [[genus]] (animal) according to the status, or point of view, which we adopt. The significant thing about this theory is that it explicitly declares all real existence to be individual existence and implies that whatever unity there is in the universal (specific or generic) is a product of thought. It is, therefore, a protest against the exaggerated realism of the school of [[William of Champeaux]], and, at the same time, prepares the way for the [[moderate realism]] which was definitely formulated in the 13th century.

'''Wish fulfillment''' is the satisfaction of a desire through an involuntary thought process. Wish fulfillment can occur in dreams or in daydreams, in the symptoms of [[neurosis]], or in the [[hallucinations]] of [[psychosis]]. This satisfaction is often indirect and requires [[Dream interpretation|interpretation]] to recognize.

[[Sigmund Freud]] coined the term ({{lang|de|Wunscherfüllung}}) in 1900 in an early text titled ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. {{Wikisourcehas|Freud's original book about wish fulfillment|[[wikisource:The Interpretation of Dreams|The Interpretation of Dreams]]}} According to Freud, wish fulfillment occurs when [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] desires are repressed by the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[superego]]. This repression often stems from guilt and [[taboo]]s imposed by [[society]]. Dreams are attempts by the unconscious to resolve some repressed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sigmund |first1=Freud |authorlink1=Sigmund Freud |title=Die Traumdeutung |trans-title=The Interpretation of Dreams |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams |origyear=1899 |publisher=Franz Deuticke |location=Leipzig, Vienna |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
