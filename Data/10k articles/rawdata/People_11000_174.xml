'''Abderraouf Ayadi''' ({{lang-aeb|عبد الرؤوف العيادي}}; born 12 February 1950 in [[Manouba]], [[French protectorate of Tunisia|Tunisia]]) is a Tunisian human rights activist, politician and lawyer.

After the [[Tunisian Revolution]] in 2011, he was elected as a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|Constituent Assembly]]. Temporarily serving as secretary-general of his longtime party [[Congress for the Republic]] (CPR), in 2012 he went into opposition, founding the [[Wafa Movement]], which he leads as president.

==Activism==
As an activist for human rights, Ayadi spent six and a half years in prison, five and a half in the wake of the process against the left-wing movement [[El Amal Ettounsi]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{ar icon}} [https://archive.is/20120909222756/http://www.partistunisie.com/fr/cpr-membre-370.html?PHPSESSID=13f5f453bc813fe6bd5993f64b067e03 Portrait d'Abderraouf Ayadi (Partistunisie.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; After his release from prison, Ayadi continued to be interrogated frequently, living under constant surveillance from the regime of [[Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.leaders.com.tn/article/abberraouf-ayadi-succede-a-moncef-marzouki-a-la-tete-du-cpr « Abberraouf Ayadi succède à Moncef Marzouki à la tête du CPR », ''Leaders'', 13 décembre 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424155831/http://www.leaders.com.tn/article/abberraouf-ayadi-succede-a-moncef-marzouki-a-la-tete-du-cpr |date=24 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 2001, Ayadi co-founded the Congress of the Republic (CPR) and was elected its vice-president. Ayadi participated in a 32-day hunger strike against Ben Ali's regime on 18 October 2005, the protesters then formed the [[18 October Coalition for Rights and Freedoms]].

==Political career==
After the [[Tunisian Revolution]], he was named by his party, the Congress of the Republic (CPR), as its representative at the [[Higher Authority for Realisation of the Objectives of the Revolution, Political Reform and Democratic Transition]]&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; In the [[Tunisian Constituent Assembly election, 2011|2011 Constituent Assembly election]], Ayadi was elected to represent the district of [[La Manouba]] in the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

After the election of CPR Secretary-General [[Moncef Marzouki]] as [[President of Tunisia]], Ayadi moved up as leader of the CPR.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; His nomination was however disputed by some party members and the name of [[Tahar Hmila]] was shortly brought up.&lt;ref name="2011-12-16" /&gt; Finally, on 20 December 2011, the party officially named Ayadi the CPR's interim Secretary General, to be confirmed at the party's next congress,&lt;ref name="2011-12-21" /&gt; which however had to be delayed until June 2012.&lt;ref name="2012-01-31" /&gt;

Following allegations that he had taken "positions contrary to the principles of the party and its decisions, without consultation with the political bureau", Ayadi on 19 April 2012 was dismissed from his official functions. Ayadi had lauded [[Samir Geagea]]'s right-wing [[Lebanese Forces]], whose Christian militia was responsible for the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in 1982. [[Haythem Belgacem]] temporarily replaced Ayadi as secretary general of the CPR.&lt;ref name="2012-04-19" /&gt;

Only a few days later, on 9 May 2012, Ayadi and a group of fellow partisans and members of the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|Constituent Assembly]] announced that they would leave the CPR and form a new party under the name of "Wafa" (meaning "faithful", used here in the sense of "faithful to the revolution").&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lapresse.tn/10052012/49575/fatale-scission.html Nizar Hajbi, « Fatale scission ! », ''La Presse de Tunisie'', 10 mai 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517175418/http://www.lapresse.tn/10052012/49575/fatale-scission.html |date=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.mosaiquefm.net/index/a/ActuDetail/Element/21374-Le-Parti-Wafa-d%C3%A9cline-l-invitation-de-Moncef-Marzouki-pour-son-manque-de-pr%C3%A9rogatives.html Le parti Wafa décline l'invitation de Moncef Marzouki pour son manque de prérogatives]&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July, the [[Wafa Movement]] was officially founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} http://www.mag14.com/national/40-politique/666-el-wafa-lfideles-a-la-revolutionr.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late June 2014, Ayadi was one of the first to announce his candidacy for the [[Tunisian presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gnet.tn/actualites-nationales/tunisie-abderraouf-ayadi-annonce-sa-candidature-a-la-presidentielle/id-menu-958.html | title=Tunisie : Abderraouf Ayadi annonce sa candidature à la présidentielle | work=GlobalNet | date=27 June 2014 | accessdate=24 November 2014 | language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Tunisian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 parliamentary election]], his new party however lost all its seats. On 19 December 2014 he however withdrew.&lt;ref name="2014-11-19" /&gt;

==Positions==
On 25 February 2012, Ayadi declared on Tunisian TV that the first President of Tunisia, [[Habib Bourguiba]], had been "hostile to Arab culture and Islam".&lt;ref name="2012-02-26"/&gt;

When in March 2012, the preamble of the new [[Tunisian Constitution]] was discussed, Ayadi supported [[Ennahda Movement|Ennahda]]'s proposal to keep intact Article 1 of the 1959 constitution describing the country as a republic with Arabic being its language and Islam its religion. Ayadi said: "As long as the identity of the country is Arab-Muslim, the article remains accurate and relevant." The decision could potentially prevent the abuse of religion for political gains, he said: "Prophet Mohammed used politics for religion. Now we are afraid that some will use religion for politics – especially when the goals aren’t always clear."&lt;ref name="2012-03-26" /&gt;

In May 2012, he declared that he would "respect and love" [[Adolf Hitler]] who had never done anything against the Arabs. He claimed that the situation for Tunisia had even improved with the [[Tunisia Campaign|German invasion]] during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="2012-05-10" /&gt;

In January 2013, Ayadi supported the inscription of legal [[jihad]] into the [[Constitution of Tunisia]], allegedly advocating the integration of jihadist fighters into the [[Tunisian Army]].&lt;ref name="shems"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.shemsfm.net/fr/actualite/abderraouf-ayadi-pour-l-integration-des-jihadistes-au-sein-du-ministere-de-la-defense?id=35145 « Abderraouf Ayadi pour l'intégration des jihadistes au sein du ministère de la Défense ! », ''Shems FM'', 28 janvier 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; This information was disclaimed by Wafa party officials on the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.businessnews.com.tn/Tunisie-%E2%80%93-Wafa-d%C3%A9ment-que-Abderraouf-Ayadi-ait-propos%C3%A9-d%E2%80%99int%C3%A9grer-les-jihadistes-dans-l%E2%80%99arm%C3%A9e-nationale-%28MAJ%29,520,35931,3 « Tunisie – Wafa dément que Abderraouf Ayadi ait proposé d'intégrer les jihadistes dans l'armée nationale », ''Business News'', 28 janvier 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the murder of left-wing leader [[Chokri Belaid]], one of Ayadi's allies during the times as activists,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} http://protectionline.org/fr/2010/12/29/abderraouf-ayadi-chokri-belaid-et-abdelkader-ben-khemis-defenseurs-des-droits-de-l%C2%92homme-assaillis-et-sequestres/&lt;/ref&gt; on 6 February 2013, Prime Minister [[Hamadi Jebali]] from the Islamist [[Ennahda Movement|Ennahda]] party announced on 12 February that he would form a government of "national unity" which would consist of "apolitical technocrats." Abderraouf Ayadi's Wafa party immediately criticized this proposal and stressed that a government which remains true to the values of the revolution should remain "political in nature."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tunisia-live.net/2013/02/11/live-updates-tunisia-struggles-to-form-new-government/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2013 he proposed that a dialogue be started with the outlawed Islamist terror group [[Ansar al-Sharia (Tunisia)|Ansar al-Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Asma|last=Smadhi|title=Assembly Member Suggests Dialogue with Ansar al-Sharia|agency=Tunisia Live|date=21 November 2013|accessdate=21 November 2013|url=http://www.tunisia-live.net/2013/11/21/assembly-member-suggests-dialogue-with-ansar-al-sharia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Ezz''' (born 1959) is an [[Egypt]]ian businessman and one-time politician, the owner of [[Ezz Steel]] and the former chairman of Egypt's national assembly's budget committee.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/15/mubaraks-allies-fear-theyre-targets]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a former senior member of the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party of Egypt]] (NDP) .

==Life and career==
Ahmed Ezz was born to Muslim parents. In 1959, Ezz graduated from [[Cairo University]] with a degree in Civil Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/PersonDetail.aspx?PersonID=25304598#ref492562659 Zoominfo]&lt;/ref&gt; He has been elected twice as the head of the [[Arab Iron and Steel Union]].  Prior to his work in organized labor, Ezz was a parliamentary member representing the districts of Sadat-Monouf-Sers al-Liyan in Monofuyia from the year 2000 to 2011, and also the Chairman of the Planning and Budgeting Committee of the [[People's Assembly of Egypt]] as a member of the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]]. (According to [[Al Jazeera]], he resigned from the NDP on 29 January 2011.)

Prior to the revolution, opposition parties, other parliamentarians, and groups accused Ezz of monopolizing the steel industry in Egypt by holding more than 60 percent of the market share, describing it as an act that is backed up by the government, an act that was described by the active parliamentarian Aboul Ezz Al Hariri as "enhancing the proliferation of monopolies rather than fighting them". The groups mentioned are even blaming him of increasing the steel prices of as much as 70 percent. In response Ezz has told reporters that a competition law "would at least provide a legal framework preventing everyone from making accusations".

Ezz companies were investigated twice for monopoly by the Egyptian Competition Authority, both before and after the January 2011 Revolution. The companies were found "not guilty" of any monopolistic or anti-competition actions both times. Ahmed Ezz was also prosecuted for the same charge and found not guilty by the Egyptian Economic Court in July 2013.

Ezz was planning on running in the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 Egyptian parliamentary election]] as an independent in the [[Sadat City]] constituency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com//news/mubarak-era-steel-tycoon-starts-electoral-campaign-monufiya|title=Mubarak-era steel tycoon starts electoral campaign in Monufiya|date=17 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=Egypt Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he lost his appeal after he was disqualified from running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/124049/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-court-dismisses-steel-tycoon-Ahmed-Ezz-ap.aspx|title=Egyptian court dismisses steel tycoon Ahmed Ezz' appeal against elections ban|date=27 February 2015|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=Ahram Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another appeal was adjourned until 22 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/03/15/court-adjourns-ahmed-ezzs-appeal-on-election-ban-to-22-april/|title=Court adjourns Ahmed Ezz’s appeal on election ban to 22 April|date=16 March 2015|accessdate=17 March 2015|work=Daily News Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and conviction==
After the resignation of Hosni Mubarak due to the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], on 17 February 2011 Ahmed Ezz was arrested, along with former interior minister [[Habib el-Adly]], former minister of housing [[Ahmed Maghrabi]] and former tourism minister [[Zuheir Garana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12500968 |title=BBC News - Egypt after Mubarak: Three ex-ministers arrested |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110218052005/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12500968| archivedate= 18 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  News of the arrests spread quickly in the local Egyptian press.  As a result, many fear that Ahmed Ezz will not receive a fair trial under a 1981 provision of Egyptian emergency law.  Amr Bargisi, a senior partner with the Egyptian Union of Liberal Youth, told the'' Washington Times''  "I am afraid the divorce of wealth from power will probably not only lead to the unfair treatment of many businessmen and former politicians, but might also take Egypt in a direction that will be devastating for the economy and the prospects of democracy. Every businessman at the moment is a suspect of the revolutionary regime and the public. If this trend continues, we will see major capital flight from Egypt."&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"/&gt;  Joe Stork, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division, told the ''Washington Times'' of Mr. Ezz:  "Certainly he, like anyone else, has his right to a fair trial. The judicial proceedings he is subjected to should meet fair-trial standards; he should know the accusations against him; he should be able to confront those who are accusing him."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/15/mubaraks-allies-fear-theyre-targets/print/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 11 March letter from prison that was published on the Bikyamas website, Mr. Ezz refuted the charges against him and warned that "In this unprecedented time for the country, it is important to remember what our youth are calling for: freedom, fairness and democracy. My hope is that this commitment to a bright future for Egypt is not undermined at its first hurdle through a desire to find scapegoats. I truly hope I can at least depend on a full representation of the facts, due legal process and a fair trial."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On 5 October 2012, Ahmed Ezz was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to seven years in jail – plus a fine of 19.5bn Egyptian pounds (about $3bn; £2bn) Mr. Hammam was also fined 35 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19830922 |title=Egyptian steel magnate Ahmed Ezz convicted |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2012 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sentences were later appealed by Ahmed Ezz and they are currently being re-tried for this case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5502">'''André Jullien''' (1766 at [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], [[Saône-et-Loire]] &amp;ndash; 1832 of [[cholera]] in [[Paris]]) was a French [[vintner]] and pioneering [[wine]] writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=[[Jancis Robinson]] | encyclopedia=[[Oxford Companion to Wine]] |edition= Third |title=Jullien, André |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-860990-6 |page=377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine historian [[Hugh Johnson (wine)|Hugh Johnson]] describes Jullien's work as "the foundation-stone of modern writing about wine".&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 236-251, et al "&gt;H. Johnson ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 236-251, 313-340, 374-390, 412-433 Simon and Schuster 1989 {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vintner activities==
At the age of around 30, Jullien moved to Paris and entered the [[wholesale]] wine trade. As a ''[[négociant]]'' he made several improvements to the practices of the wine trade; he invented an air tube to better being able to tap wine and a powder for clarification of wine. For this, he was awarded gold medals at various exhibitions and was supported by the minister [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal]].

==Publications==
Jullien initiated the ambitious project of describing all known [[wine region]]s and their wines, and in this he made a pioneering effort, as the professional wine literature was almost solely concerned with how to grow vines and make wine, and not with describing and comparing different wine regions. This took him on many a distant journey and the result was his ''Topographie de tous les vignobles connus'',&lt;ref&gt;Jullien, André (1816). ''Topographie de tous les vignobles connus, contenant : leur position géographique, l'indication du genre et de la qualité des produits de chaque cru, les lieux où se font les chargements et le principal commerce de vin, le nom et la capacité des tonneaux et des mesures en usage, les moyens de transport ordinairement employés, suivie d'une classification générale des vins.''''[https://books.google.com/books?ei=YSGrTOgNkePiBr_g0fIH&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=fr&amp;id=xvs6AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=Topographie+de+tous+les+vignobles+connus&amp;q=hermitage]''. Google Book Search. Retrieved on October 04, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in a first edition in 1816, and a second in 1822. An important feature of this work was his [[Classification of wine|classification]] of all wines into five classes. An abridged edition translated into English was published in 1824 as "a manual and guide to all importers and purchasers in the choice of wines". The third and fourth French editions in 1832 incorporated many changes and were further expanded. This edition was awarded the [[French Academy of Sciences]]' statistics prize in 1832. The final two editions were signed "corrected and augmented by C.E. Jullien" who was likely Jullien's son.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 236-251, et al "/&gt;

He also published a manual for [[sommelier]]s under the title ''Manuel du sommelier''&lt;ref&gt;Complete title: ''Manuel du sommelier, ou instruction pratique sur la manière de soigner les vins.''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1822 and the technical publication ''Appareils perfectionnés propres à transvaser les vins et autres liqueurs avec ou sans communication avec l'air extérieur'' in 1832.

===Wine writings===
In his 1816 work, ''Topographie de tous les vignobles connus'', Jullien created the most comprehensive cataloging of the world's wine region ever done up to that point. In addition to describing the well known European wine region, Jullien also described [[Cossack]] [[winemaking]] techniques used in [[Ekaterinoslav]], wine styles of [[Hindu Kush]] and [[Astrakhan]], and surveyed the vineyards of several islands in the [[Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. On the islands of [[Madeira (wine)|Madeira]], he compared the dry wines made from [[Sercial]] to the great wines of the [[Rhine (wine)|Rhine]]-a description that would support the [[apocryphal]] belief that the Madeira grape descended from the [[German wine]] [[grape variety]] [[Riesling]]. In Madeira, he also described unusual [[aging (wine)|aging]] methods employed on the island, such as the tradition of burying [[oak barrels]] of wine in a pit for 6 months underneath layers of horse [[manure]].&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 236-251, et al "/&gt;

His writings on [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]] include one of the earliest classifications of the region's estate with [[Château Haut-Brion|Haut-Brion]], [[Chateau Margaux|Margaux]], [[Château Latour|Latour]] and [[Lafite]] listed among the finest wine of the area. Nearly 40 years later, the official [[1855 classification]] would closely mirror Jullien's rankings including all of the [[first growths]].&lt;ref&gt;Clive Coates ''"[https://books.google.com/books?id=igIhpGSRj1IC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=andre+jullien+bordeaux+first+growth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sy0hTNiMMqmJnAfqu4R8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=andre%20jullien%20bordeaux%20first%20growth&amp;f=false The Wines of Bordeaux]"'' pg 47, Google Books, Accessed: June 22nd, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling with the English wine writer [[Cyrus Redding]] in Germany, Jullien described the quality of German wines produced during the [[comet vintage]] of 1811.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 236-251, et al "/&gt;

[[Image:Odin, Lodur, Hoenir skabe Ask og Embla by Frølich.jpg|thumb|300px|upright|"Hœnir, Lóðurr and Odin create Askr and Embla" (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
In [[Norse mythology]], '''Ask and Embla''' (from {{lang-non|Askr ok Embla}})—male and female respectively—were the first two humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In both sources, [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|three]] gods, one of whom is [[Odin]], find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.

==Etymology==
[[File:Ask and Embla by Robert Engels.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of Ask and Embla (1919) by Robert Engels.]]
[[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|askr}} literally means "[[fraxinus excelsior|ash tree]]" but the [[etymology]] of ''embla'' is uncertain, and two possibilities of the meaning of ''embla'' are generally proposed. The first meaning, "[[Ulmus glabra|elm tree]]", is problematic, and is reached by deriving ''*Elm-la'' from ''*Almilōn'' and subsequently to {{lang|non|almr}} ("elm").&lt;ref name=SIMEK74&gt;Simek (2007:74).&lt;/ref&gt; The second suggestion is "[[vine]]", which is reached through ''*Ambilō'', which may be related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] term {{lang|grc|ἄμπελος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|ámpelos}}), itself meaning "vine, [[liana]]".&lt;ref name=SIMEK74&gt;Simek (2007:74).&lt;/ref&gt; The latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories.

According to [[Benjamin Thorpe]] "[[Jacob Grimm|Grimm]] says the word embla, emla, signifies a busy woman, from amr, ambr, aml, ambl, assiduous labour; the same relation as [[Mashya and Mashyana|Meshia and Meshiane]], the [[Iranian religion|ancient Persian]] names of the first man and woman, who were also formed from trees."&lt;ref name=THORPE337&gt;Thorpe (1907:337).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestations==
In stanza 17 of the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', the [[völva]] reciting the Poem states that [[Hœnir]], [[Lóðurr]] and [[Odin]] once found Ask and Embla on Land. The Völva says that the two were capable of very little, lacking in ''[[wyrd|ørlög]]'' and says that they were given three gifts by the three gods:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:&lt;small&gt;Old Norse:&lt;/small&gt;
:''Ǫnd þau né átto, óð þau né hǫfðo,''
:''lá né læti né lito góða.''
:''Ǫnd gaf Óðinn, óð gaf Hœnir,''
:''lá gaf Lóðurr ok lito góða.''&lt;ref name=DRONKE11&gt;Dronke (1997:11).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:Spirit they possessed not, sense they had not,
:blood nor motive powers, nor goodly colour.
:Spirit gave Odin, sense gave Hœnir,
:blood gave Lodur, and goodly colour.&lt;ref name=THORPE5&gt;Thorpe (1866:5).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:Soul they had not, sense they had not,
:Heat nor motion, nor goodly hue;
:Soul gave Othin, sense gave Hönir,
:Heat gave Lothur and goodly hue.&lt;ref name=BELLOWS8&gt;Bellows (1936:8).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The meaning of these gifts has been a matter of scholarly disagreement and translations therefore vary.&lt;ref name="SCHACH93"&gt;Schach (1985:93).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to chapter 9 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the three brothers [[Vili and Vé|Vili, Vé]], and Odin, are the creators of the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there. They took the wood and from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names. Ask and Embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of [[Midgard]].&lt;ref name=BYOCK18&gt;Byock (2006:18).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
[[Image:Sölvesborg Ask och Embla2.jpg|thumb|upright|"Ask och Embla" (1948) by [[Stig Blomberg]]. In [[Sölvesborg]], Sweden. Photo by Henrik Sendelbach.]]

===Indo-European origins===
A [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of ''embla'' meaning "vine." In Indo-European societies, an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and [[sexual intercourse]]. Vines were used as a flammable wood, where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood, resulting in fire. Further evidence of ritual making of fire in [[Scandinavia]] has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a [[The King's Grave|Bronze Age grave in Kivik]], [[Scania]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=SIMEK74/&gt;

[[Jaan Puhvel]] comments that "ancient myths teem with trite 'first couples' of the type of [[Adam and Eve|Adam and his by-product Eve]]. In Indo-European tradition, these range from the Vedic Yama and Yamī and the Iranian Mašya and Mašyānag to the Icelandic Askr and Embla, with trees or rocks as preferred raw material, and [[dragon]]'s teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure".&lt;ref name="PUHVEL-284"&gt;Puhvel (1989 [1987]:284).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in Indo-European society, Anders Hultgård observes that "myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient Europe and Indo-Europe and Indo-European-speaking peoples of Asia Minor and Iran. By contrast the cultures of the Near East show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive man's origin from clay, earth or blood by means of a divine creation act".&lt;ref name="HULTGAARD-62"&gt;Hultgård (2006:62).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other potential Germanic analogues===
Two wooden figures—the [[Braak Bog Figures]]—of "more than human height" were unearthed from a [[peat bog]] at [[Braak]] in [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]], [[Germany]]. The figures depict a nude male and a nude female. [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] comments that these figures may represent a "Lord and Lady" of the [[Vanir]], a group of Norse gods, and that "another memory of [these wooden deities] may survive in the tradition of the creation of Ask and Embla, the man and woman who founded the human race, created by the gods from trees on the seashore".&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON-88-89"&gt;Davidson (1975:88—89).&lt;/ref&gt;

A figure named [[Oisc of Kent|Æsc]] ([[Old English language|Old English]] "ash tree") appears as the son of [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengest]] in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] genealogy for the kings of [[Kent]]. This has resulted in a number of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre-Norse [[Germanic mythology]].&lt;ref name=ORCHARD8&gt;Orchard (1997:8).&lt;/ref&gt;

Connections have been proposed between Ask and Embla and the [[Vandals|Vandal]] kings Assi and Ambri, attested in [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 7th century AD work ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]''. There, the two ask the god [[Wōdanaz|Godan]] (Odin) for victory. The name ''Ambri'', like Embla, likely derives from ''*Ambilō''.&lt;ref name=SIMEK74/&gt;

===Catalog of dwarfs===
A stanza preceding the account of the creation of Ask and Embla in ''Völuspá'' provides a catalog of [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]], and stanza 10 has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth. This may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans, and that the three gods gave them life.&lt;ref name="LINDOW62-63"&gt;Lindow (2001:62—63).&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyne Larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in Old Norse works (examples include "trees of jewellery" for women and "trees of battle" for men) due to the origin of humankind stemming from trees; Ask and Embla.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON279&gt;Larrington (1999:279).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern influence==
Ask and Embla have been the subject of a number of references and artistic depictions. A sculpture depicting the two stands in the southern Swedish city of [[Sölvesborg]], created in 1948 by Stig Blomberg. Ask and Embla are depicted on two of the sixteen wooden panels found on the [[Oslo City Hall]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], by [[Dagfin Werenskiold]].&lt;ref name=OSLOKOMMUNE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oslo.kommune.no/losartikler/article23199-7726.html?articleID=23199&amp;categoryID=7726&amp;tip=1 |title=Yggdrasilfrisen |author=Municipality of Oslo |date=2001-06-26 |accessdate=2008-09-08 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125125123/http://www.oslo.kommune.no/losartikler/article23199-7726.html?articleID=23199&amp;categoryID=7726&amp;tip=1 |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Billy Smart Jr.''' (born '''Stanley Smart''', 15 October 1934 &amp;ndash; 23 May 2005) was a British [[circus (performing art)|circus]] performer and [[impresario]].

==Biography==
[[File:Billy Smart Junior Grave 1.jpg|thumb|Grave of Billy Smart Jr. at St Peter's Church, [[Cranbourne, Berkshire]]]]
Smart, whose real name was Stanley, was the tenth child and third son of [[Billy Smart Sr.]] His father was a [[showman]] and [[funfair|fairground]] proprietor, who bought a circus in 1946. He would travel with the Circus and go to local schools when at a location for a lengthy period. One school was 'All Saints' at Blackheath, London in 1958, the heath being a popular location for the circus. The first appearance of the Billy Smart circus was on 5 April at Southall Park in Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Smart Jnr |publisher=''[[The Stage]]'' |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/8039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circus toured alongside Smart's funfair; the tents blew down and the circus carried out its performances for two days in the open air. Smart made his circus debut with "Billy Smart's New World Circus" as assistant ringmaster aged 12. He was soon performing with [[pony|ponies]] and [[horse]]s, but became best known later for his [[elephant]] acts. In one famous incident, he tamed a herd of performing [[elephant]]s when they [[stampede]]d in the ring. At its peak, Billy Smart's four-masted [[Big top (circus)|Big Top]] could hold over 6,000 people, with a show including hundreds of animals and performers.

Smart, together with his brothers, Ronald Smart and David Smart, took over management of the circus when their father died in 1966 at [[Ipswich]]. The circus ceased touring in 1971, but televised performances continued until 1983, drawing audiences of up to 22 million at its height. The Smart Brothers also developed [[Guernsey]] [[Zoo]], selling it in 1972, and opened [[Windsor Safari Park]] in 1969 before selling it in 1977, for the equivalent of £30m in 2017 (it is now the site of [[Legoland Windsor]]). He lost the sight in his right eye in 1978 after [[cosmetic surgery]] severed the [[optic nerve]], ending his career as an animal trainer.

In 1985, the Smart circus Winkfield winter quarters were sold for the equivalent of £20m in 2017.

The "Billy Smart's" touring circus was revived by his brother Ronald and nephew Gary in 1993, but Smart concentrated on a second career as a property developer, based in [[Spain]].

==In popular culture==
In the Netherlands, Billy Smart was famous for the annual "Billy Smart's Kinderkerstcircus" ("Billy Smart's Children Christmas Circus") TV broadcast. Dutch singer Fay Lovsky listed Billy Smart in her 1981 hit "Christmas Was A Friend of Mine" as one of her favourite Christmas traditions.
His circus was used in the 1967 movie Berserk, starring Joan Crawford and Diana Dors. In the movie the circus was called the Great Rivers Circus.
In 1960, the cult classic "Circus of Horrors" directed by Sydney Hayers, was filmed in Billy Smarts Circus. In the picture, it was called the "Schuler" circus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4155">'''Brangaine''' (variously spelled Brangaene, Brangwane, Brangien, Brangwin, etc.) is the [[handmaiden|handmaid]] and confidante of [[Iseult]] of [[Ireland]] in the [[Arthurian legend]] of [[Tristan and Iseult]]. She appears in most versions of the story.

Brangaine plays essentially the same role in the early poetic versions of [[Béroul]] and [[Thomas of Britain]], and their respective [[Germany|German]] successors [[Eilhart von Oberge]] and [[Gottfried von Strassburg]]. She is the inadvertent catalyst in the development of the story's central romance: before [[Tristan]] takes Iseult back to [[Cornwall]] to be the wife of his uncle [[Mark of Cornwall|Mark]], Iseult's mother (also named Iseult) entrusts Brangaine with a love [[potion]] meant for Iseult and her new husband to drink on their wedding night. However, Tristan and Iseult find the potion on the boat ride to Cornwall, and mistaking it for regular wine, they drink it. So begins their unstoppable passion. Upon arrival in Cornwall, the virgin Brangaine plays a second important role: she secretly substitutes for Iseult on her wedding night to King Mark, protecting Iseult's honor. Afterwards, however, Iseult grows worried that Brangaine might reveal their secret, or develop feelings for Mark. She orders servants to take her out in the woods and kill her. The servants cannot bring themselves to do it, and instead tie the handmaid to a tree. Iseult comes to her senses, and overjoyed that Brangaine is not dead, frees her and apologizes for her actions.

In some versions Brangaine later serves as a [[Courtly love|love]] [[Love interest|interest]] for Tristan's brother and friend [[Kahedin]]. Mark has finally discovered his wife and nephew's adultery and banishes Tristan to [[Brittany]], where the saddened knight tries to forget his love by marrying another girl named [[Iseult#Iseult of Brittany|Iseult]], this one the daughter of King [[Hoel]] and sister of Kahedin. However, he cannot bring himself to consummate the marriage, which his wife eventually reveals to her brother. When questioned, Tristan reveals his secret love and attempts to prove how beautiful his original Iseult was by showing Kahedin a statue he had made of her. However, Kahedin is more impressed by a second statue of Brangaine, and journeys with Tristan back to Mark's lands in hopes of meeting her. In disguise they are able to tryst with the ladies, but Brangaine uses a magic pillow to put Kahedin to sleep before he can touch her. Eventually Iseult demands Brangaine sleep with him to end his dishonor. The short poem ''Kaherdin and Camille'' records a similar story; in this case the name of Iseult's servant is Camille.

Brangaine's role in the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']] is sometimes different from in the verse works. For example, the scene in which the handmaid substitutes for Iseult on her wedding night is excluded, and while the tree-tying episode is still present, it is not Iseult but jealous rival servants who order the deed. Additionally she is rescued by the [[Saracen]] knight [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]], rather than her mistress as in the older works.

According to [[Rachel Bromwich]], several parallels can be drawn between the character of Brangaine in French Arthurian [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] and that of [[Branwen]] in [[medieval Welsh]] legend, lending credence to the theory that the former is ultimately based on the latter.&lt;ref name="medscot"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Heather Rose |title=Concerning the Names ''Branwen'', ''Bronwen'' and the Like |publisher=MedievalScotland.org |date=25 September 1997 |url=http://medievalscotland.org/problem/names/branwen.shtml |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brothers Čapek''' were [[Josef Čapek|Josef]] and [[Karel Čapek]], Czech writers who sometimes wrote together. They are commemorated both for their literary/artistic works and political activism against oppressive government. Their house is now a cultural monument of the [[Czech Republic]], and there are various memorials to them. Their most famous work is the play ''[[Pictures from the Insects' Life]]'', a humorous political allegory.

During the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] (AD&amp;nbsp;306–337), [[Christianity]] began to transition to the dominant religion of the [[Roman Empire]]. Historians remain uncertain about Constantine's reasons for favoring Christianity, and theologians and historians have often argued about which form of [[early Christianity]] he subscribed to. There is no consensus among scholars as to whether he adopted his mother [[Helena (empress)|Helena]]'s Christianity in his youth, or, as claimed by [[Eusebius]], encouraged her to convert to the faith he had adopted himself. Some scholars question the extent to which he should be considered a Christian emperor: "Constantine saw himself as an 'emperor of the Christian people'. If this made him a Christian is the subject of debate,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/constantine.html Roman-Empire.net retrieved 19 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gerbending 2004 55"&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Attribution needed|date=March 2017|reason=not sufficient to provide ref tags}} although he allegedly received a [[baptism]] shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/people/p/constantine.htm About.com retrieved 19 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's decision to cease the [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]] was a turning point for early Christianity, sometimes referred to as the Triumph of the Church, the [[Peace of the Church]] or the [[Constantinian shift]]. In 313, Constantine and [[Licinius]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] decriminalizing Christian worship. The emperor became a great patron of the Church and set a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor within the Church and the notion of [[orthodoxy]], [[Christendom]], [[ecumenical councils]], and the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] [[Edict of Thessalonica|declared by edict in 380]]. He is revered as a [[saint]] and [[isapostolos]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], and various [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] for his example as a "Christian monarch."

==Before Constantine==
{{main article|Early Christianity}}
{{see also|Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|Diocletianic Persecution}}
The first recorded official persecution of Christians on behalf of the Roman Empire was in AD&amp;nbsp;64, when, as reported by the [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] [[Tacitus]], Emperor [[Nero]] attempted to blame Christians for the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. According to Church tradition, it was during the reign of Nero that [[St Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] were martyred in Rome. However, modern historians debate whether the Roman government [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|distinguished between Christians and Jews]] prior to [[Nerva]]'s modification of the ''[[Fiscus Judaicus]]'' in 96, from which point practicing Jews paid the tax and Christians did not.&lt;ref&gt;Wylen, Stephen M., ''The Jews in the Time of Jesus: An Introduction'', Paulist Press (1995), {{ISBN|0-8091-3610-4}}, Pp 190-192.; Dunn, James D.G., ''Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing (1999), {{ISBN|0-8028-4498-7}}, Pp 33-34.; Boatwright, Mary Taliaferro &amp; Gargola, Daniel J &amp; Talbert, Richard John Alexander, ''The Romans: From Village to Empire'', Oxford University Press (2004), {{ISBN|0-19-511875-8}}, p. 426.;&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians suffered from sporadic and localized [[Persecution of Christians|persecutions]] over a period of two and a half centuries. Their refusal to participate in [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] was considered an act of [[treason]] and was thus punishable by execution. The most widespread official persecution was carried out by [[Diocletian]]. During the Great Persecution (303–311), the emperor ordered Christian buildings and the homes of Christians torn down and their sacred books collected and burned. Christians were arrested, tortured, mutilated, burned, starved, and condemned to gladiatorial contests to amuse spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Bomgardner, D. L. ''The Story of the Roman Amphitheatre''. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Persecution officially ended in April 311, when [[Galerius]], senior emperor of the [[Tetrarchy]], issued an edict of toleration, which granted Christians the right to practice their religion, though it did not restore any property to them.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, [https://www.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#XXXIV ''De Mortibus Persecutorum''] ("On the Deaths of the Persecutors") ch. 35–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine, [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] in the Western empire, and Licinius, Caesar in the East, also were signatories to the edict of toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Galerius, "Edict of Toleration", in Documents of the Christian Church, trans. and ed. Henry Bettenson (London: Oxford University Press, 1963), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that Galerius' reversal of his long-standing policy of Christian persecution has been attributable to one or both of these co-Caesars.&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Drake, Constantine and the Bishops: The Politics of Intolerance (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000), 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion==
[[File:Constantine's conversion.jpg|right|thumb|''Constantine's conversion'', as imagined by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]].]]
It is possible (but not certain) that Constantine's mother, Helena, exposed him to Christianity; in any case he only declared himself a Christian after issuing the [[Edict of Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Battle of Milvian Bridge===
[[Eusebius of Caesarea]] and other Christian sources record that Constantine experienced a dramatic event in 312 at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]], after which Constantine claimed the emperorship in the West. According to these sources, Constantine looked up to the sun before the battle and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the Greek words "''{{lang|grc|Ἐν Τούτῳ Νίκα}}''" (in this sign, conquer), often rendered in a Latin version, ''"[[in hoc signo vinces]]"'' (in this sign, you will conquer). Constantine commanded his troops to adorn their shields with a Christian symbol (the [[Labarum|Chi-Rho]]), and thereafter they were victorious.&lt;ref name="Gerbending 2004 55"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the battle, the new emperor ignored the altars to [[List of Roman deities|the gods]] prepared on the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline]] and did not carry out the customary sacrifices to celebrate a general's victorious entry into Rome, instead heading directly to the imperial palace.&lt;ref name="Peter Brown 2003 p. 60"/&gt; Most influential people in the empire, however, especially high military officials, had not been converted to Christianity and still participated in the [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional religions of Rome]]; Constantine's rule exhibited at least a willingness to appease these factions. The [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] minted up to eight years after the battle still bore the images of Roman gods.&lt;ref name = "Gerbending 2004 55" /&gt; The monuments he first commissioned, such as the [[Arch of Constantine]], contained no reference to Christianity.&lt;ref name = "Peter Brown 2003 p. 60" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Curran, ''Pagan City and Christian Capital. Rome in the Fourth Century'' (Oxford, 2000) pp. 70–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edict of Milan===
In 313 Constantine and [[Licinius]] announced "that it was proper that the Christians and all others should have liberty to follow that mode of religion which to each of them appeared best,"&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, [https://www.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#XLVIII ''De Mortibus Persecutorum''] ("On the Deaths of the Persecutors") ch. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby granting tolerance to all religions, including Christianity. The [[Edict of Milan]] went a step further than the earlier [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] in 311, returning confiscated Church property. This edict made the empire officially neutral with regard to religious worship; it neither made the traditional religions illegal nor made Christianity the [[state religion]], as occurred later with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] of 380. The Edict of Milan did, however, raise the stock of Christianity within the empire and it reaffirmed the importance of religious worship to the welfare of the state.&lt;ref&gt;

==Patronage of the Church==

{{see also|State church of the Roman Empire}}

The accession of Constantine was a turning point for [[early Christianity]]. After his victory, Constantine took over the role of patron of the Christian faith. He supported the Church financially, had an extraordinary number of [[basilicas]] built, granted privileges (e.g., exemption from certain taxes) to clergy, promoted Christians to high-ranking offices, returned property confiscated during the Great Persecution of Diocletian,&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; and endowed the church with land and other wealth.&lt;ref name=MacMullan49&gt;MacMullan 1984:49.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 324 and 330, Constantine built a new imperial capital at [[Byzantium]] on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporos]], which would be named [[Constantinople]] for him. Unlike "old" Rome, the city began to employ overtly Christian architecture, contained churches within the city walls, and had no pre-existing temples from other religions.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

In doing this, however, Constantine required those who had not converted to Christianity to pay for the new city.&lt;ref name=MacMullan49&gt;MacMullan 1984:49.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian chroniclers tell that it appeared necessary to Constantine "to teach his subjects to give up their rites ... and to accustom them to despise their temples and the images contained therein,"&lt;ref&gt;quoted after MacMullan 1984:49.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the closure of temples because of a lack of support, their wealth flowing to the imperial treasure;&lt;ref name=MacMullan50&gt;MacMullan 1984:50.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine did not need to use force to implement this.&lt;ref name=MacMullan49&gt;MacMullan 1984:49.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] has added that temples "were annihilated", but this was considered "not true" by contemporary historians.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullan 1984: 141, Note 35 to Chapter V; Theophanes, ''Chron.'' a. 322 (PG 108.117)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public office===
Constantine respected cultivated persons, and his court was composed of older, respected, and honored men. Men from leading Roman families who declined to convert to Christianity were denied positions of power yet still received appointments; even up to the end of his life, two-thirds of his top government were non-Christian.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Legal reforms===
Constantine's laws enforced and reflected his Christian attitudes. [[Crucifixion]] was abolished for reasons of Christian piety, but was replaced with [[hanging]], to demonstrate the preservation of Roman supremacy. On March 7, 321, Sunday, already sacred to Christians and to the Roman Sun God [[Sol Invictus]], was declared an official day of rest. On that day markets were banned and public offices were closed,&lt;ref&gt;[[Corpus Juris Civilis]] 3.12.2 https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022718/http://www.freewebs.com/vitaphone1/history/justinianc.html accessed 20 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; except for the purpose of freeing slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Don A. From Sabbath to Lord's Day. Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers/Zondervan. pp. 252–98. {{ISBN|9781579103071}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, no restrictions on performing farming work, which was the work of the great majority of the population, on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen 1969; ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1908; ''Theodosian Code''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some laws made during his reign were even humane in the modern sense, possibly inspired by his Christianity:&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, John Julius, ''A Short History of Byzantium''. Alfred A. Knopf, 1997, p. 8. {{ISBN|0-679-77269-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a prisoner was no longer to be kept in total darkness but must be given the outdoors and daylight; a condemned man was allowed to die in the arena, but he could not be branded on his "heavenly beautified" face, since God was supposed to have made man in his image, but only on the feet.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Margaret Ruth, ''The Word Made Flesh: A History of Christian Thought''. Blackwell Publishing, 2004, p. 70, {{ISBN|1-4051-0846-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Publicly displayed [[Gladiator|gladiatorial games]] were ordered to be eliminated in 325.

===Early Christian Bibles===
{{main article|Fifty Bibles of Constantine}}
In 331, Constantine commissioned [[Eusebius]] to deliver fifty [[Bible]]s for the [[Church of Constantinople]]. [[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded around 340 Alexandrian scribes preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known. It has been speculated that this may have provided motivation for [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|canon lists]], and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]] are examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canon Debate'', McDonald &amp; Sanders editors, 2002, pages 414-415, for the entire paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian emperorship ==

=== Enforcement of doctrine ===

The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to the gods for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define orthodoxy and maintain orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church generally regarded the definition of doctrine as the responsibility of the [[bishop]]s; the emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out [[heresy]], and uphold ecclesiastical unity.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor ensured that God was properly worshiped in his empire; what proper worship (orthodoxy) and doctrines and dogma consisted of was for the Church to determine.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine had become a worshiper of the Christian God, but he found that there were many opinions on that worship and indeed on who and what that God was. In 316, Constantine was asked to adjudicate in a [[Africa (Roman province)|North African]] dispute between the [[Donatism|Donatist]] sect (who began by refusing obedience to any bishops who had yielded in any way to persecution, later regarding all bishops but their own sect as utterly contaminated). More significantly, in 325 he summoned the [[First Council of Nicaea]], effectively the first [[Ecumenical Council]] (unless the [[Council of Jerusalem]] is so classified).&lt;ref&gt;Pre-Ecumenical councils include the [[Council of Rome (155)]], [[Second Council of Rome]] 193, [[Council of Ephesus (193)]], [[Council of Carthage (251)]], [[Council of Iconium]] 258, [[Council of Antioch (264)]], [[Council of Elvira]] 306, [[Council of Carthage (311)]], [[Council of Ancyra]] 314, [[Council of Arles (314)]] and the [[Synod of Neo-Caesarea|Council of Neo-Caesarea]] 315.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Nicaea is the first major attempt by Christians to define orthodoxy for the whole Church. Until Nicaea, all previous Church Councils had been local or regional synods affecting only portions of the Church.

Nicaea dealt primarily with the [[Arianism|Arian]] controversy. Constantine himself was torn between the Arian and [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] camps. After the Nicene council, and against its conclusions, he eventually recalled [[Arius]] from exile and banished [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] to [[Trier]].

Just before his death in May 337, Constantine was baptised into Christianity. Up until this time he had been a catechuman for most of his adult life. He believed that if he waited to get baptized on his death bed he was in less danger of polluting his soul with sin and not getting to heaven. He was baptized by his distant relative [[Arianism|Arian]] Bishop [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]]. During Eusebius of Nicomedia's time in the Imperial court, the Eastern court and the major positions in the Eastern Church were held by Arians or Arian sympathizers.&lt;ref name="drake-pp395"&gt;Drake, "Constantine and the Bishops", pp.395.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of a short period of eclipse, Eusebius enjoyed the complete confidence both of Constantine and [[Constantius II]] and was the tutor of Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Eusebius of Nicomedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Constantine's death, his son and successor Constantius II was an Arian, as was Emperor [[Valens]].

===Suppression of other religions===
{{main article|Constantine I's turn against Paganism}}
{{see also|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism}}
Constantine's position on the religions traditionally practiced in Rome evolved during his reign. In fact, his coinage and other official motifs, until 325, had affiliated him with the pagan cult of [[Sol Invictus]]. At first, Constantine encouraged the construction of new temples&lt;ref name="Gerberding2004p28"&gt;Gerberding, R. and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and tolerated [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|traditional sacrifices]];&lt;ref name = "Peter Brown 2003 p. 60"/&gt; by the end of his reign, he had begun to order the [[pillaging]] and tearing down of [[Roman temple]]s.&lt;ref name="ramsey"&gt;R. MacMullen, "Christianizing The Roman Empire A.D.100-400, Yale University Press, 1984, {{ISBN|0-300-03642-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;"A History of the Church", [[Philip Hughes (historian)|Philip Hughes]], Sheed &amp; Ward, rev ed 1949, vol I chapter 6.[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/HUGHHIST.TXT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EusebiusSchaff"&gt;Eusebius Pamphilius and [[Philip Schaff|Schaff, Philip]] (Editor) and McGiffert, Rev. Arthur Cushman, Ph.D. (Translator) [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.txt ''NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine''] quote: "he razed to their foundations those of them which had been the chief objects of superstitious reverence".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian relations===
Beyond the ''[[limes]]'', east of the [[Euphrates]], the [[Sasanian]] rulers of the [[Persian Empire]], [[Roman-Persian Wars|perennially at war with Rome]], had usually [[Sasanian Church|tolerated Christianity]]. Constantine is said to have written to [[Shapur II]] in 324 and urged him to protect Christians under his rule.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, vita Constantini IV, 8-13&lt;/ref&gt; With the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, Christians in Persia would be regarded as allies of Persia's ancient enemy. According to an anonymous Christian account, Shapur II wrote to his generals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Moffett, Samuel H. | title=A History of Christianity in Asia: Beginnings to 1500 | year=1992 | page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gnosis.org/thomasbook/ch13.html|title=After Constantine|website=gnosis.org|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You will arrest Simon, chief of the Christians. You will keep him until he signs this document and consents to collect for us a double tax and double tribute from the Christians … for we Gods &lt;ref&gt;In general, there is a "silence of the Perso-Arab and classical historians on any claim by Iranian kings to divinity".

They inhabit our territory and agree with Caesar, our enemy.|Shapur II|A History of Christianity in Asia: Beginnings to 1500}}

==Constantinian shift==
[[Constantinian shift]] is a term used by some [[Christian theology|theologians]] and [[Ancient history|historians of antiquity]] to describe the political and theological aspects and outcomes of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th-century]] process of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine's integration of the Imperial government with the Church]] that began with the [[First Council of Nicaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|
title=A Peculiar People|publisher=InterVarsity Press|first=Rodney|last=Clapp|year=1996|page=23|quote=What might be called the Constantinian shift began around the year 200 and took more than two hundred years to grow and unfold to full bloom.|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized by the [[Mennonite]] theologian [[John H. Yoder]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in {{cite book|title=The Future of Theology: Essays in Honor of Jurgen Moltmann|publisher = Eerdmanns|year=1996|editor=Miroslav Volf |editor2=Carmen Krieg |editor3=Thomas Kucharz |first = John H.|last = Yoder|chapter = Is There Such a Thing as Being Ready for Another Millennium?|page=65|quote=The most impressive transitory change underlying our common experience, one that some thought was a permanent lunge forward in salvation history, was the so-called Constantinian shift.|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that there ever was Constantinian shift has been disputed; [[Peter Leithart]] argues that there was a "brief, ambiguous 'Constantinian moment' in the fourth century," but that there was "no permanent, epochal 'Constantinian shift'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Leithart]], ''[[Defending Constantine: The Twilight of an Empire and the Dawn of Christendom]]'', p 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Huck''' is an English drug trafficker who, from his {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[County Clare]] estate (Ireland), headed successful European-North African drug running operations during the 1980s and 1990s that are worth an estimated £30-40 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3715205.stm |title=Underworld rich list |accessdate=2008-02-12 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2004-05-16 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he became the subject of an investigation by the [[Criminal Assets Bureau]] during the Irish government's crackdown on drug traffickers, organized crime figures and other prominent criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20040516/ai_n12894627 |title=The Rich Crooks List |accessdate=2006-12-06 |author=O'Keefe, Michelle |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2004-16-2004 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Sunday Mirror]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Huck was importing drugs from a North African ship port to a Southern port of England, Uk Customs had infiltrated  his organisation, Huck was on board his vessel and handed over what was said to be 4 tons of cannabis, to undercover Officers of UK Customs, who set off back to the UK to deliver to  UK based recipients. The chartered undercover Customs Vessel sank at sea in the Bay of Biscay, all the cannabis went with it. The four Officers were rescued by a passing Norwegian freighter, they were then picked up by a British Destroyer (*assisting Uk Customs and were helicoptered back to the Uk (Culdrose RNAS). Meanwhile, Hucks vessel had turned back towards Spain, it was intercepted and escorted in Spain from whence Huck was subsequently extradited to face trial at Exeter. The UK Customs undercover team, delivered cannabis owned by Customs, to a beach in Cornwall where they were met by a "shore party" who had been under surveillance by Officers dug in on the hillside . Further arrests were made assisted by a Devon And Cornwall Police armed team.  After a six-week [[Crown Court]] trial at Exeter in front of Judge Sean Overend during which the defence team tried to maintain that the drugs lost in Bisacy were Henna not Cannabis,  Huck was found Guilty on attempting to import Illegal substances, and possession of a class B drug With intent to supply and given 14 years in a high security Class A prison, with the option of parole. The 14 years was the highest possible and highest ever sentence given in the UK for Cannabis trafficking. The Crown Court also considered a fine of £1,000,000 to accompany the 14-year jail sentence but the jury rejected this proposal. Huck was released from an unknown prison after serving 10 years of his sentence, with 4 months left of his probation, Huck travelled to Amsterdam and received a call, this call was logged and Huck was arrested by Dutch police and charged for talking to known criminals, an offence which is not present in the UK. Huck was then kept on remand for a year and found guilty but released as he had already served his sentence while he was on remand.

'''Dean &amp; Britta''' is a musical duo consisting of [[Dean Wareham]] and [[Britta Phillips]], both former members of [[Luna (1990s American band)|Luna]]. Wareham had formed Luna in 1991 after leaving his first band, [[Galaxie 500]]. Phillips joined Luna in 2000, replacing bassist [[Justin Harwood]].

==History==
Their first album started out as a Wareham solo project, but when he heard Phillips' demos, he asked her to join him. "L'Avventura" was produced by [[Tony Visconti]] and was released on [[Jetset Records]] in 2003 under the name "Britta Phillips &amp; Dean Wareham." After hearing the album, [[Peter Kember]] (a.k.a. Sonic Boom  of [[Spacemen 3]], Spectrum, &amp; E.A.R.) fell in love with it and did a remix mini LP entitled "Sonic Souvenirs" (also on Jetset Records).

After Luna broke up in 2005, Dean &amp; Britta spent the next year working on film scores (most notably [[Noah Baumbach]]'s movie, 
''[[The Squid and the Whale]]''), and promoting the documentary film of Luna's farewell tour ''[[Tell Me Do You Miss Me]]''. They were married during the recording of their album ''Back Numbers'' (also produced by Tony Visconti), and simplified their name to "Dean &amp; Britta". ''Back Numbers'' was released on [[Rounder Records]] in February 2007 followed by a limited edition EP, "Words You Used To Say". In 2006 Dean and Britta did a Take-Away Show video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dean &amp; Britta Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dean-britta-mn0000514890/biography|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Dean &amp; Britta covered [[The Cure]]'s "Friday I'm In Love" for [[American Laundromat Records]] tribute compilation "Just Like Heaven - a tribute to The Cure".

'''Don Coppersmith''' (born {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1950) is a [[cryptographer]] and [[mathematician]]. He was involved in the design of the [[Data Encryption Standard]] [[block cipher]] at [[IBM]], particularly the design of the [[S-box]]es, strengthening them against [[differential cryptanalysis]].&lt;ref name="coppersmith"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; He has also worked on [[algorithm]]s for computing [[discrete logarithm]]s, the [[cryptanalysis]] of [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], methods for rapid [[matrix multiplication]] (see [[Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm]]) and IBM's [[MARS (cryptography)|MARS]] cipher. Don is also a co-designer of the [[SEAL (cipher)|SEAL]] and [[Scream (cipher)|Scream]] ciphers.

In 1972, Coppersmith obtained a Bachelor's degree in [[mathematics]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and a Masters and PhD in mathematics from [[Harvard University]] in 1975 and 1977 respectively.&lt;ref name="coppersmith"/&gt; He was a [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition#Putnam Fellows|Putnam Fellow]] each year from 1968–1971, becoming the first four-time Putnam Fellow in history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">{{refimprove|date=June 2018}}In [[sociology]], a '''dyad''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δυάς}} ''dyás'', "pair") is a group of two people, the smallest possible social group. As an adjective, "dyadic" describes their interaction.

The pair of individuals in a dyad can be linked via romantic interest, family relation, interests, work, partners in crime, and so on. The relation can be based on equality, but may be based on an asymmetrical or hierarchical relationship (master–servant).

The strength of the relationship is evaluated on the basis of time the individuals spend together, as well as on the emotional intensity of their relationship.

A dyad can be unstable because both persons must cooperate to make it work. If one of the two fails to complete their duties, the group would fall apart. Because of the significance of [[marriage]]s in society, their stability is very important. For this reason marital dyads are often enforced through legal, economic, and religious laws.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John J., and Linda Marie Gerber. Sociology. 7th ed. Toronto: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2011. 153-54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyadic [[friendship]]s refer to the most immediate and concrete level of peer [[Social interaction|interaction]], which is expanded to include new forms of relationships in adolescence – most notably, romantic and sexual relationships. Already [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] treated it as a special pattern of ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|gemeinschaft]]'', 1887, as ''community of spirit''.

== Meaning ==
Dyad means two things of similar kind or nature or group and dyadic communication means the inter-relationship between the two. In practice, this relationship refers to dialogic relations or face-to-face verbal communication between two people involving their mutual ideas, thought, behaviour, ideals, liking, disliking, and the queries and answers concerning life and living in nature. A sudden communication between two strangers in the street and not continued afterwards or not having lasting aftereffect on each other can not be termed as dyadic communication. Examples of dyadic communication occur between [[Jesus]] and [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[the Buddha]] and [[Ananda]], or between [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], where dialog is not only outward, superficial, or mechanical, but instead brings the two people into a sphere where each person influences the other.

A lasting communication of ideas between two people for long duration of time or of any intensive duration of deeper impact may be called dyadic communication.

'''Fyodor Fyodorovich Raskolnikov''' ({{lang-ru|Фёдор Фёдорович Раскольников}}; (28 January 1892, [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] – 12 September 1939, [[Nice, France|Nice]], [[France]]),&lt;ref name=veche&gt;Zalessky K.A.

==Career==

===Early life===
Fyodor Raskolnikov was born to a general's daughter, A. V. Ilyina, and an [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest F.A. Petrov&lt;ref name=CPSU&gt;[http://www.hronos.km.ru/biograf/raskolnikov.html Online biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626152956/http://www.hronos.km.ru/biograf/raskolnikov.html |date=2007-06-26 }} based on Zaytsev V.S. ''Voprosy Istorii KPSS'' N12 1963, etc. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to other sources, [[archpriest]] Sergushenkov&lt;ref name=veche/&gt;).  Alternatively,  "... his father was Fedor Ilyin, a progressive St. Petersburg churchman, a widower who could not legally remarry and whose sons were therefore technically illegitimate.  The Ilyin family life was fairly normal ..."&lt;ref&gt;Norman F. Saul, "Fedor Rashkolnikov, a 'Seconday Bpolshevik'", ''Russian Review'' v.32 no. 2, April 1973, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Prince Oldenburgsky Orphanage,&lt;ref name=CPSU/&gt; studied at [[Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute]], and then at the [[Midshipman]] (''gardemarin'') School in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name=veche/&gt;

In December 1910 he joined the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], and he was attracted to [[Zvezda (newspaper)|''Zvezda'']] and went on to work for the Bolshevik newspaper, [[Pravda]].  He was arrested, and allowed to emigrate, but after running into trouble with the German police, he returned illegally to Russia, and was again arrested and exiled to [[Arkhangelsk Oblast|Arkhangel]], but released in 1913 under the amnesty called to mark the 300th anniversary of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Makers of the Russian Revolution|last = Haupt and Jean-Jacques Marie|first = George|publisher = George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd|year = 1974|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted in the navy on the outbreak of war, and in 1917 he received the Naval rank of [[Midshipman]] (''michman'') but he did not participate in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=veche/&gt;

===Kronstadt===
In March 1917 he was sent to the sea fortress of [[Kronstadt]], where he edited the newspaper ''Golos Pravdy'' (Voice of Truth): an incarnation of the forbidden at that time [[Pravda]] newspaper.&lt;ref name=veche/&gt; He was one of the organizers of the [[Kronstadt Mutiny]] in July 1917. He was arrested by troops loyal to the [[Russian Provisional Government]] but released on October 11, 1917, a few weeks before the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref name=veche/&gt;

===Remainder of the revolution===
In November 1917 Raskolnikov with a group of Kronstadt seamen was sent to fight anti-Bolshevik insurgents in [[Moscow]]. He was elected to the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]. On 29 January 1918 he became the deputy [[Narkom]] of "Naval Affairs".&lt;ref name=veche/&gt; In summer 1918, he married [[Larisa Reisner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Larissa Reisner|last = Porter|first = Cathy|publisher = Virago|year = 1988|isbn = 0-86068-857-7|location = London|pages = 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1918, he was sent to the [[Kazan]], as the [[Commissar]] (member of [[Revvoeyensovet]]) of the Eastern Front. On the Eastern Front, he commanded (since August 1918) the Red Volga Flotilla, which participated in the [[Kazan Operation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Pearce]], [http://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/red-army/1918/raskolnikov/ilyin/index.htm Introduction] to Fyodor Raskolnikov s "Tales of Sub-lieutenant Ilyin."&lt;/ref&gt;

Raskolnikov was promoted to membership of the [[Revvoeyensovet]] of [[RSFSR]] on (September 2, 1918). At the end of 1918 he became the deputy commander of the 7th Army and the Commissar of the [[Baltic Fleet]].&lt;ref name=veche/&gt;

While commanding a fleet consisting of a [[battleship]], [[cruiser]] and two [[destroyer]]s that was supposed to counter the British fleet, he became a prisoner of war when his destroyer ''Spartak'' was captured by the [[Royal Navy]]&lt;ref name=veche/&gt; off the coast of Estonia in December 1918, and held in Brixton prison until May 27, 1919, when he was exchanged for 17 British prisoners of war. Appointed commander of the [[Caspian Flotilla]]&lt;ref name=veche/&gt; he led the assault on the British base at [[Bandar-e Anzali|Enzeli]], on May 18, 1920&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/red-army/1918/raskolnikov/ilyin/ch05.htm The Taking of Enzeli], by F.F. Raskolnikov&lt;/ref&gt; which destroyed what remained of the White Russian navy, and established the short lived soviet republic in [[Ghilan]], in northern Iran.

===Soviet service===
During the [[Leon Trotsky#Trade union debate (1920–1921)|Trade Union debate]] (1920) Raskolnikov supported [[Leon Trotsky]]. In June 1920 – January 1921 Raskolnikov commanded the [[Baltic Fleet]]. During his tenure relations between the commanding officers and seamen deteriorated and ended with the [[Kronstadt Rebellion]]. A month later Raskolnikov was removed from that command.&lt;ref name=veche/&gt;

During 1921–1923 Raskolnikov was the ambassador to [[Afghanistan]] (the first country that established diplomatic relations with RSFSR). Raskolnikov's actions caused a diplomatic rift with [[Great Britain]] and the British government insisted on his removal. Eventually he was replaced.&lt;ref name=veche/&gt;

From 1930 Raskolnikov was the plenipotentiary representative to [[Estonia]], then [[Denmark]], and then [[Bulgaria]].

In March 1938 he was recalled from Sofia to the [[USSR]], but on April 1 refused to return. In 1939 he published his famous ''Open Letter to Stalin'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/red-army/1918/raskolnikov/ilyin/ch08.htm Raskolnikov's Open Letter to Stalin]&lt;/ref&gt; and promptly died from "falling out of a window." According to historian [[Roy Medvedev]], he might have been assassinated by [[NKVD]] agents.&lt;ref name=veche/&gt; There are theories that the assassin might have been [[Sergei Efron]], husband of the poet [[Marina Tsvetayeva]].&lt;ref name=CPSU/&gt;

Raskolnikov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1963.&lt;ref name=veche/&gt;

==Literary career==
During 1924–1930 Raskolnikov was the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine "[[Molodaya Gvardiya (magazine)|Molodaya Gvardiya]]" (later also publishing house ''Moskovsky Rabochy''). From 1928 he was the chairman of the ''Repertory Committee'', the de facto main [[Censorship|censor]] of theatre and cinematography. He also wrote his own play ''[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]'' which even servile critics labelled "dry and boring".&lt;ref name=veche/&gt;

'''Harriet Bell''' (July 14, 1923 – September 10, 1995){{sfn|Social Security Death Index|1995}} was an American advocate for disability rights. She was a co-founder and director of the Polio Information Center and a member of the New York State Board for Nursing. Residing in the [[Goldwater Memorial Hospital]] after contracting polio, she was president of the hospital board for four terms, participating in drafting the Patient’s Bill of Rights. In 1982, she was the recipient of the Wonder Woman Foundation Award of Warner Communications Inc. as an agent of change.

==Early life==
Bell grew up in [[Buffalo, New York]] and had one sister and a step-sister. In 1931, her sister contracted [[polio]] and in 1949, her stepsister contracted the disease as well.{{sfn|Weiner|1986|p=35}} After working as a model, she married and had three children, Cathie (born 1950) and twins Douglas and Lori (born 1953).{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1955|p=11}} In 1954, she contracted polio, seven months prior to the availability of the [[polio vaccine]]. She was admitted to the [[Goldwater Memorial Hospital]] and confined to an [[iron lung]]. After experiencing anger and depression, and offering to allow her husband a divorce, Bell determined to take control of her life. Her husband refused to accept a divorce and though they lived separately, the couple parented their children together.{{sfn|Weiner|1986|p=36}} As her health improved, she gained mobility with use of a [[wheelchair]] and was able to attend family functions, though her need for mechanical respiratory assistance made it necessary for her to live at the hospital facility for twenty-five years.{{sfn|Weiner|1986|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1995}} During her tenure in residence, she was president of the hospital board for four terms, participating in drafting the Patient’s Bill of Rights.{{sfn|Weiner|1986|p=x}}

==Career==
Wishing to further her education, Bell tried to enroll in numerous universities in the New York City area but was rejected because of her disabilities. In 1977, she was accepted at [[Empire State College]] through an extension program that allowed [[distance education]] and graduated in 1979. Soon after her graduation, she moved out of the hospital, taking a nearby apartment.{{sfn|Bonnabeau|1996|p=85}} Bell and Florence Weiner co-founded the Polio Information Center, an international data base on the disease. Bell became editor and publisher of the newsletter for the center, which she operated from her residence.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1995}}{{sfn|Kenny|1986|p=120}} She was nominated and won the Wonder Woman Foundation Award of [[Warner Communications Inc.]] in 1982, for her ability to create a new reality from her circumstance.{{sfn|McCormack|1982}} In 1984, she completed her PhD studies at [[Columbia Pacific University]] with a dissertation, ''Polio Survivors: Their Quality of Life''.{{sfn|Bell|1984}} Despite being a [[quadriplegic]], Bell developed skill as a painter and a typist, using [[assistive technology]].{{sfn|Weiner|1986|pp=35, 94, 139}}

==Death and legacy==
Bell died on September 10, 1995 at her home on Roosevelt Island.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1995}} The information provided by the center she co-founded was an early resource for [[post-polio syndrome]], little known at that time,{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=19}}{{sfn|Central Virginia Post Polio Support Group|n.d.|p=2}} and became an internationally recognized reference base.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1995}}

The Japanese sect '''Ho No Hana Sanpogyo''' (法の華三法行 ''Hō No Hana Sanpōgyō'') was a [[new religious movement]] founded by "His Holiness"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pigott, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3029183.stm "Rise of Japanese cults"], BBC News, 14 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Hogen Fukunaga. The sect was found to have engaged in [[fortune telling fraud]] in Japan.

==History==
It is often called the "[[foot reading]] cult", because its founder, Hogen Fukunaga, claimed he could make a diagnosis by examining people's feet. He founded the group in 1987 after an alleged [[Spirituality|spiritual]] event where he claimed to have realized he was the [[reincarnation]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The group at one time claimed 30,000 members. However, Fukunaga charged $900 for the foot readings and a suspicion arose that he used the money to benefit himself. He was accused of swindling money from housewives and had to pay over a million dollars in damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1087178.stm "Foot-reader fined for fraud"], BBC, 25 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukunaga started preaching in 1980, claiming to be the world's final savior following Jesus Christ and Buddha.&lt;ref name="12 years"&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2005/07/16/national/honohana-foot-cult-guru-gets-12-years-for-fraud/ "Honohana foot-cult guru gets 12 years for fraud"], ''The Japan Times'', July 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He was then 34 and saddled with 500 million yen of debt. Soon he became a household name through the publication of texts (nearly 70 at latest count) penned by [[ghostwriter]]s. In 1987 the sect gained official recognition as a [[religious corporation]].&lt;ref name="Supreme and ugly"&gt;[http://ftp.cultnews.net/group/1004-japanese-sects/10980-supreme-and-ugly-truths.html "Supreme and ugly truths"]{{deadlink|date=June 2017}}, ''Asahi News'', May 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In a twist on [[palm reading]], Fukunaga and other cult leaders read the soles of people's feet.&lt;ref name=Mainichi&gt;[http://www.apologeticsindex.org/news/an991205.html#12 "Police raid foot-reading cult"], ''Mainichi Daily News'', Dec. 2, 1999,&lt;/ref&gt; They told the victims, who visited the cult for counseling about physical or family problems, that their problems would worsen unless they attended a cult seminar, which cost 2.25 million yen, or donated up to 14.3 million yen to the cult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2000/10/24/national/honohana-cultists-admit-to-fraud/ "Honohana cultists admit to fraud"], ''The Japan Times'', Oct. 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They used shocking words to fuel their concern, falsely claimed their diseases could be cured through training in his cult, and swindled exorbitant amounts of money from them.&lt;ref name="12 years"/&gt; They were urged to purchase high-priced scrolls and other ornaments that were said to ward off evil, cure illnesses, deliver from sin, and break family curses.&lt;ref name=Mainichi/&gt;

The intimidation was often accompanied by a specific threat.&lt;ref name="Supreme and ugly"/&gt; A victim was coerced during a number of visits by cult officials to shell out another $22,000 for a five-day training seminar at the cult's sprawling headquarters below [[Mount Fuji]]. The purpose, he said, was to "purify" his mind and body.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;Uli Schmetzer, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-01-05/news/0101050185_1_gurus-new-world-order-spiritual "In Japan, Spirituality Search Can Lead to Cults"], ''Chicago Tribune'', January 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader set cult members strict recruitment goals in a bid to swell the group's ranks. Separate goals were set for each of the group's branch offices. When the cult's new facility was being built, at a cost of 600 million yen, Fukunaga reportedly ordered cult members to work toward an even harder goal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultnews.culteducation.com/group/1004-japanese-sects/10967-cult-leader-set-tough-goals-for-followers-.html "Cult leader set tough goals for followers"]{{deadlink|date=June 2017}}, ''Yomiuri Shimbun'', December 4, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
Staff members eagerly studied Fukunaga's methods of threatening people to make them enroll in special training sessions, the sources said. At these meetings, Fukunaga repeatedly said that lying was acceptable to lure people to enroll in the special training. "You should use your 'wisdom' and say things, even if they may not actually be true." He explained that lies were acceptable as people would learn reason once they began the special training. The group prepared a manual to train people.&lt;ref name=Apologetics&gt;[http://www.apologeticsindex.org/news/an991205.html#13 "Sole man gladhanded rich and famous"], ''Mainichi Daily News'' (Japan), Dec. 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukunaga would wear $5,000 suits and custom-made Italian shoes. His wife, according to senior cult members, regularly spent $6,000 to $7,000 a month shopping.&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt; Fukunaga reportedly obtained 60 billion yen from more than 10,000 people over the past 13 years, while he spent enormous amounts enhancing his reputation as a religious leader by "buying" audiences with former [[Soviet President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Pope John Paul II]],&lt;ref name="Supreme and ugly"/&gt; [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], [[Mother Teresa]],&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt; [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Sathya Sai Baba]] and celebrities.&lt;ref name=Apologetics/&gt;

According to a report by Christian newsweekly ''World'': "The Clinton [[White House]] fundraising scandal",

&lt;blockquote&gt;In May 1996, a [[fundraising]] dinner organized by Mr. Huang was held at the Sheraton Carlton Hotel in [[Washington, D.C.]] [[Yogesh Gandhi]], a distant relative of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], paid for his ticket and that of a friend, Dr. Hogen Fukunaga, with a $325,000 contribution. (At the dinner, Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Fukunaga presented Mr. Clinton the 1996 "[[Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Award]].") Mr. Fukunaga, leader of a Japanese religious sect known as Ho no Hana Sanpogyo, is a [[multimillionaire]], while Mr. Gandhi, a naturalized American, is a man of little means, indeed a "pauper", according to papers filed in his recent divorce case. After ''The Los Angeles Times'' reported in October the details of Mr. Gandhi's lowly economic status, the DNC concluded that the $325,000 he had donated probably never belonged to him and returned "his" money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The power of The purse|url=https://world.wng.org/1997/01/the_power_of_the_purse?|website=World Magazine|accessdate=9 June 2017|date=January 25, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The founder was sentenced to 12 years in prison for bilking his flock out of 150 million yen in the name of religious training.&lt;ref name="12 years"/&gt; 15 senior cult members were charged with the mass [[fraud]]. Nine of the 15 were given verdicts, with all of them convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2001/hono_dec01.htm "Japanese foot-reading cult's 2IC jailed for five years"], AFP, December 6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors charged them with practicing medicine without a license. Fukunaga might yet face [[manslaughter]] charges in the deaths of four recruits who died during rigorous initiation rites at Mount Fuji.

Legal experts say Japan's criminal justice system is ill-equipped to combat the cult phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt;

'''Ivor Churchill Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (16 January 1873 – 14 June 1939), known as '''Lord Ashby St Ledgers''' from 1910 to 1914 and as '''Lord Wimborne''' from 1914, was a British politician and one of the last [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lords Lieutenant of Ireland]], serving in that position at the time of the [[Easter Rising]].

==Background and education==
He was the eldest son of [[Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne]], and Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill, daughter of [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]]. He was the elder brother of [[Frederick Guest]], [[Oscar Guest]] and [[Henry Guest]], and a first cousin of [[Winston Churchill]].  He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GST890IC|name=Guest, the Hon. Ivor Churchill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was commissioned a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in the [[Dorset Yeomanry]] on 9 May 1896. Following the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in late 1899, he volunteered for service and was appointed a lieutenant in the [[Imperial Yeomanry]] on 24 February 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27168|page=1256| date=23 February 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27171|page=1528| date=6 March 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving England for [[South Africa]] on the ''SS Manchester Merchant'' in early March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The War - Embarcation of Troops|day_of_week=Saturday |date=3 March 1900 |page_number=16 |issue=36080| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Queen's South Africa Medal]] with two clasps. After returning to the United Kingdom, he was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 18 January 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette | issue=27398 | date=17 January 1902 |page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career, 1900–1915==
[[File:1906 Ivor Guest.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Pictured in 1906]]
[[File:Wimborne 5496668395 4d06324734 o.jpg|thumb|[[Hernando Fitz-James Stuart, 14th Duke of Peñaranda de Duero]] and Lord Wimborne on 4 June 1914 in New York City for the 1914 [[Westchester Cup]]]]
He was elected to Parliament for [[Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth]] in a [[Plymouth by-election, 1900|by-election]] in February 1900 (a seat he had unsuccessfully contested in 1898),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette | issue=27167 | date=20 February 1900 |page=1170}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], and retained his seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|general election of 1900]]. In 1904, during the controversy within the Conservative Party over adopting [[Imperial Preference|protectionism]], he and other members of his family followed Churchill into the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in support of [[free trade]].

He sat as an MP until 1910, when he was raised to the [[peerage]] as '''Baron Ashby St Ledgers''', of [[Ashby St Ledgers]] in the [[Northamptonshire|County of Northampton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue= 28349 |date= 18 March 1910 |page=1953 |city= London }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became [[Paymaster General]] in the government of [[H. H. Asquith]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazlehurst, C., Whitehead, S. and Woodland, C., ''A Guide to the Papers of British Cabinet Ministers, 1900–1964'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Paymaster General until 1912, and later served as a [[Lord in Waiting]] on King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].

In 1914, he succeeded his father as '''Baron Wimborne'''. At the start of [[World War I]], he was appointed to the staff of the newly formed [[10th (Irish) Division]] under Lieutenant-General Sir [[Bryan Mahon]] at the [[Curragh Camp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'', Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1970, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="townshend147"&gt;Townshend, Charles, ''Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion'', Penguin, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-14-101216-2}}, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1915–1918==
In February 1915, Wimborne was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in succession to [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Aberdeen]].  At this time, the Lord Lieutenant was largely a ceremonial position; real power was in the hands of the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretary]] and the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland|Under-Secretary]].  Determined to be more involved in decision-making, he was appointed Director of Recruiting in October 1915, heading up the new Department of Recruiting for Ireland.&lt;ref name="townshend147"/&gt; He insisted on being kept up to date on the state of the country, and had the Under-Secretary, Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], send him police reports, details of prosecutions and recruitment figures.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'' pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

On the weekend preceding the [[Easter Rising]], following the capture of the German arms ship ''Aud'' and the arrest of Sir [[Roger Casement]], Wimborne urged Nathan to order the arrest of a large number of rebel leaders.  Nathan was unwilling to do so without the authorisation of the Chief Secretary, [[Augustine Birrell]], who was in London.&lt;ref&gt;Townshend, Charles, ''Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion'' pp. 149–151&lt;/ref&gt; Before the authorisation was received, the Rising began on 24 April 1916.  Wimborne proclaimed [[martial law]] in Dublin.  Thereafter, the military took control.  A new Commander-in Chief, General Sir [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|John Maxwell]], arrived in Ireland on 28 April and the rebels surrendered on 29 April.  Wimborne initially refused to offer his resignation after the Rising.  He resigned under pressure from the government but was re-appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'' pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Commission]] on the 1916 Rebellion (the [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Hardinge]] commission) exonerated Wimborne of any blame for the Rising, saying that his position as Lord Lieutenant was "anomalous in quiet times and almost unworkable in times of crisis".&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'' p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; He continued as Lord Lieutenant for another two years. On his retirement in 1918, he was created '''Viscount Wimborne''', of [[Canford Magna]] in the County of Dorset.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue= 30781 |date= 5 July 1918 |page=7940 |city= London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
[[File:Alice-wimborne-1914 edited-1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lady Wimborne in 1914]]
On 10 February 1902, he married at [[St Peter's Church, Eaton Square]], London, the Honourable Alice Grosvenor (1880–1948), daughter of [[Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Baron Ebury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court circular|day_of_week=Tuesday |date=11 February 1902 |page_number=10 |issue=36688| }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had one son, [[Ivor Guest, 2nd Viscount Wimborne]], and two daughters, Rosemary and Cynthia.

By the 1930s, they were living separate lives, though remaining on the friendliest terms. From 1934 until her death, Alice was linked with the composer [[William Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Portrait of Walton|author=Kennedy, Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=78|year=1989|isbn=0-19-816705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wimborne died in June 1939, aged 66, at [[Wimbourne House|Wimborne House]] in Arlington Street, London, the house in which he was born. He was succeeded by his only son, Ivor. Lady Wimborne died in April 1948, aged 67.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3856">'''Jan Dalibor''' (1921 &amp;ndash; 2013) and his wife '''Vlasta Dalibor''' (born '''Vlasta Cely''', 22 May 1921 &amp;ndash; 21 February 2016) were Czech-born British [[puppeteers]], responsible for devising and developing the characters [[Pinky and Perky]] on [[children's television]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Biography==
Vlasta Cely was born in [[Brno]], and became friends with Jan Dalibor as a child.  She attended a language school and the Janacek Academy of performing arts while Jan taught an art class, but after the [[German annexation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi annexation of Czechoslovakia]] he was made to work in a factory and she became secretary to a businessman.   They married after the end of [[World War II]], and in 1948 escaped from the new Communist regime by making their way to [[Austria]].  Arriving as [[refugee]]s in Britain, they settled in [[Yorkshire]].  Jan worked in a stone quarry at [[Tadcaster]] and as a miner, and Vlasta worked as a housemaid in Hundhill&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12174970/Vlasta-Dalibor-puppeteer-obituary.html  "Vlasta Dalibor, puppeteer - obituary", ''The Telegraph'', 29 February 2016]. Retrieved 7 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In his spare time Jan Dalibor began making wooden [[marionette]]s, and Vlasta suggested that he make some in the shape of pigs, a symbol of good luck in Czechoslovakia.   They began performing with their puppets in 1951, and made their first appearance in a [[variety show|summer season show]] at [[Heysham]] in 1956.  The puppets "Pinky" and "Perky" (originally "Porky") were initially minor uncredited characters in the show.   They were seen there by Trevor Hill, producer of ''[[The Sooty Show]]'', and the Dalibors made their first television appearance later that year on a [[BBC]] talent show, ''It's Up to You'', which featured the two puppet piglets.&lt;ref name=bacon/&gt;&lt;ref name=denny&gt;[http://www.iandenny.co.uk/page45d.htm "Jan and Vlasta Dalibor", ''IanDenny.co.uk'']. Retrieved 7 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1958, [[Pinky and Perky]] began nine years of regular series on BBC television,  their show often appearing immediately before the regular early evening news bulletin, where their comments on current affairs occasionally attracted controversy.&lt;ref name=bacon/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  The shows also included many other marionettes constructed by Jan Dalibor, and his work was noted for its fine craftsmanship which enabled the puppets to be shown in close-up.   Over 200 episodes of the show were broadcast.  At the peak of their popularity in the early and mid-1960s, the shows attracted audiences of 15 million, and the characters, with high-pitched speeded-up voices,  appeared on records as well as a wide range of merchandise.&lt;ref name=denny/&gt;  They appeared at the 1963 [[Royal Variety Performance]] alongside [[the Beatles]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the characters also became popular in the US, appearing on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=bacon/&gt;  

In 1968, the ''Pinky and Perky'' television series was dropped by the BBC but moved to [[Thames Television]] for a further four years.  The Dalibors retired in 1973, and sold the rights to their characters for £500,000.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=bacon/&gt;  The characters were revived on BBC television in 2008.&lt;ref name=bacon&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3562830/Pinky-and-Perky-still-bringing-home-the-bacon.html  Bernadette McNulty, "Pinky and Perky: still bringing home the bacon", ''The Telegraph'', 31 October 2008]. Retrieved 7 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple retired to [[Newport, Pembrokeshire]].  Jan Dalibor died in 2013, and Vlasta in 2016.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''Timothy Isaiah Courtright''' (1848 – February 8, 1887),&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt; also known as '''"Longhair Jim"''' or '''"Big Jim" Courtright''', was a Sheriff in Ft. Worth, Texas from 1876-1879.  In 1887, he was killed in a shootout with gambler and gunfighter [[Luke Short]]. Before his death, people feared Courtright's reputation as a gunman, and he successfully reduced Ft. Worth's murder rate by more than half, while reportedly extracting [[protection racket|protection money]] from town business owners.

== Early life ==

Courtright was born in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]], [[Illinois]], which includes the capital city of [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], in the spring of 1848, the son of Daniel Courtright.  He had four older sisters and one younger brother. He was also reported to have practiced shooting frequently. He lied about his age and enlisted in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He served under General [[John A. Logan]] for whom he once took a bullet and therefore earned Logan's admiration. He was rootless, and traveled around often until he finally settled in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] in north [[Texas]]. While in Fort Worth, Courtright was at various times a jailer, city [[marshal]], deputy sheriff, deputy [[U.S. Marshal]], hired killer, [[private detective]], and [[racketeer]]. During his travels, Courtright had developed a reputation as being fast with a gun.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

He married Sarah Weeks and taught her how to shoot. They held shooting exhibitions for which they charged admission, and later performed as part of [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]].&lt;ref name=vanostrand&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Ostrand|first1=Maggie|title=Luke Short, The Undertakers' Friend|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/MaggieVanOstrand/Luke-Short-The-Undertakers-Friend.htm|publisher=Texas Escapes|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=December 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawman career ==

Courtright and his wife arrived in Ft. Worth in 1876. He ran for office as the first elected city marshal against four other men, and won by three votes. He liked to wear his hair long and wore two revolvers with their butts facing forward, showman style.&lt;ref name=vanostrand/&gt; He became known for his long hair and his reputation for using his badge as a matter of convenience.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt;

As marshal, he was in charge of keeping the peace in the notorious "Hells Half Acre" (the town's [[red-light district]]).  At that time, Fort Worth was a very dangerous place, with altercations between unruly drunks and lawmen being commonplace. Few people dared to cross him, and he killed several who did.  On August 25, 1877, Deputy Marshal Columbus Fitzgerald was shot and killed while attempting to break up a street fight. Courtright shot and killed the suspect that same night.  During his tenure as Ft. Worth Marshal, it's reported that he killed at least four other men during altercations and shootouts.&lt;ref name="historynet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/?s=+Jim+Courtright historynet.com  |title=Jim Courtright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortworthpd.com/history.htm fortworthpd.com: FWPD History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202093209/http://www.fortworthpd.com/history.htm |date=2005-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was generally believed that he murdered several unwilling business owners who would not pay into his [[protection racket]].&lt;ref name="historynet" /&gt; Most met his demand to avoid the risk of becoming the target of his anger and gun. Some who declined died, and those who survived usually made the payments demanded.&lt;ref name="historynet" /&gt;

=== Life after Ft. Worth ===

He served as Ft. Worth's Marshal until 1879, when he lost his third election. He left his family behind, he moved to New Mexico and obtained appointment as the Marshal of Lake Valley, and after that as a hired guard for a mining operation. Sometime later, while working as a ranch foreman, he and his friend Jim McIntire shot and killed two squatters who had refused to leave the ranch.&lt;ref name=vanostrand/&gt;

=== American Valley murders ===

In 1883, his former Civil War commander [[John A. Logan]] was interested in purchasing the American Valley Cattle Company in New Mexico. The company controlled a vast tract of land about {{convert|66|by|72|mi|km}} wide. Maintaining that he was concerned about ongoing cattle rustling that was decimating herds, U.S. Marshal A. L. Morisson invited his deputies Courtright and Jim McIntire to help secure the land.

But the current owner John P. Casey and his partners W. C. Moore and Henry M. Atkison had bigger ambitions: they wanted ownership of an additional {{convert|3400|acre|ha}} acres with water rights that would allow them to gain control of an additional {{convert|3000000|acre|ha}} of quality grazing land. They had already forced about 90 residents of the small community of Rito off their land. But Alexis Grossetete and Robert Elsinger, partners in a ranch at Gallo Springs were resistant to Moore's threats. They had claimed their land under preemption rights that guaranteed settlers the right to file a [[land patent|patent]] on unsurveyed land. Both had brought their families onto the land and made it evident they intended to stay. Casey accused them of being squatters and was determined to evict them.

Casey's partner W. C. Moore had a dark past. He was hired by D. T. Beals and W. H. Bates, owners of the LX Ranch in the [[Texas Panhandle]], to manage a large herd. He started in 1877 but during 1881 they discovered that he was siphoning off a good portion of the stock for his own herd and they fired him. Moore sold his Adobe Walls Ranch for $75,000 (or about  ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|75000|1882|r=-5}}}} million in today's dollars) and used $25,000 of the proceeds to buy a one-third interest in Casey's American Valley Cattle Company. Courtwright may have initially believed he was only hired to pursue cattle rustlers. He was told by Moore that they were pursuing a former employee of Casey's named D. L. Gilmore near [[Socorro, New Mexico]]. Moore led the posse directly to the ranch headquarters in American Valley and the next day they looked for Gilmore's cowboys, ending the day at a line cabin about {{convert|8|mi}} from Grossetete's and Elsinger's homes. The next day Moore took five of the posse and rode towards their homes. Moore told the party that their job was to get rid of the two "squatters." He said all six would fire into their bodies so all six would be equally guilty. They found the men, took their weapons, marched them to a narrow ravine, and killed them both.&lt;ref name=dearment&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeArment|first1=Robert K.|title=Jim Courtright of Fort Worth: his life and legend|date=2004|publisher=TCU Press|location=Fort Worth|isbn=978-0875652924|pages=127–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel H. McAllister, a Deacon in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], had been until a few days before the manager of Casey's ranch. When he learned of the murders, he informed the authorities, who promptly called for Moore and his fellow posse members' arrest. Courtwright and McIntire initially acted as lawmen and arrested the others who had taken part in the murders, but when the grand jury convened, they learned that the two men had also taken part. Moore escaped arrest, and before Courtwright and McIntire could be apprehended, they took off for Mexico on horseback, finally ending up on June 1 in [[El Paso, Texas]], where they found safety among a number of former Texas Rangers who knew them both. Courtwright sent for his wife and children who had been in Los Angeles. McIntire also summoned his wife and the two families headed to Ft. Worth, where they successfully fought extradition to New Mexico, claiming the two men were "Mexicans" and they had been performing their duties as lawmen.&lt;ref name=dearment/&gt;

== Forms detective agency ==

Secure in Ft. Worth, in 1884 Courtwright tried once again to form a detective agency. In New Mexico, two men were tried and acquitted of the murders, and authorities renewed their effort to bring Courtwright to justice.&lt;ref name=dearment/&gt;{{rp|150}}

== Courtright vs Short ==
[[Luke Short]] was a gunfighter, gambler and bar owner who had drifted down to Fort Worth from [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Kansas]]. While in Dodge City, Short had dabbled in gambling, and became friends with several other noted Old West figures, such as [[Bat Masterson]], [[James Masterson|Jim Masterson]] and [[Wyatt Earp]], who had also become friends with Courtright. In Fort Worth, he managed the ''White Elephant'', a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]]/gambling house.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LOW"/&gt;

Marshal Courtright was running a protection racket at the time, and needed to make an example of Short, who also had a sizable reputation as a gunfighter mostly due to an 1881 gunfight with gunslinger [[Charlie Storms]] at the ''Oriental Saloon'' in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="LOW"/&gt; Most historians believe that Courtright offered [[protection racket|protection]] to the White Elephant and that Short informed him that he did not need his protection.

On February 8, 1887, at about 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Courtright called out Luke Short, carrying a pair of pistols, and challenging him to come out of the White Elephant, but a friend Jake Johnson managed to calm him down and told him that they should talk about the affair instead. In Short's own accounts, both men walked up the street one block, until they were in front of bar and brothel owner Ella Blackwell's Shooting Gallery, the two men facing one another three to four feet apart.&lt;ref name= "tchj-badblood "&gt;[http://tchj.com/2013/11/01/bad-blood/ Tarrant County Historical Journal—Bad Blood]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeAr"&gt;DeArment, Robert K. ''Jim Courtright of Fort Worth: His Life and Legend ''. Texas Christian University Press; First edition (August 4, 2004). pp.226-227. {{ISBN|978-0875652924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words were passed, and evidently Courtright, who had been drinking considerably, had made some indication about Short having a gun. Short assured Courtright he was not armed, although he was.&lt;ref name="LOW"/&gt; Short moved slowly toward Courtright, saying that he could have a look himself, at which point he pulled open his vest. Courtright then said loudly "Don't you pull a gun on me."&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt; With that statement, Courtright drew his pistol and in that second Short produced his pistol and fired one shot, which took off Courtright's thumb on his shooting hand. As Courtright attempted to shift his pistol to his other hand, Short fired four more shots in quick succession. Courtright fell backward and died shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;

The showdown was also witnessed by fellow gunfighter [[Bat Masterson]], who was with Luke Short at that time.&lt;ref name="BatM"&gt;[http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-lukeshort5.html Luke Short - A Dandy Gunfighter by W.R. (Bat) Masterson in 1907] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513233240/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-lukeshort5.html |date=2016-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Masterson published his own, more neutral account of the events that unfold, in which he stated that it was Jim Courtright, who called for Luke Short to meet him in the street for a confrontation, while carrying a "brace of pistols" of his own. Masterson described what followed:

{{quote|No time was wasted in the exchange of words once the men faced each other. Both drew their pistols at the same time, but, as usual, Short's spoke first and a bullet from a Colt's 45-calibre pistol went crashing through Courtright's body. The shock caused him to reel backward; then he got another and still another, and by the time his lifeless form had reached the floor, Luke had succeeded in shooting him five times.&lt;ref name="BatM"/&gt;}}

Investigations on the gunfight concluded that while it was Courtright who went for his pistol first, it was Short who ultimately outdrew and killed him.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fieldandstream.com/photos/gallery/guns/rifles/2009/02/david-e-petzals-five-greatest-gunfights-old-west?photo=1#node-1001320741 |title= Five Greatest Gunfights of the Old West |last=Petzal |first=David |publisher=''Field and Stream'' |date= |accessdate=April 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LOW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-gunfights4.html|title=Gunfighters Part 4|publisher=''Legends of America''|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courtright's inability to fire off a shot was due to a number of possible scenarios; one was that his pistol got caught on his watch chain for a second as he drew it, and another was that his pistol broke when one of Short's bullets struck it and his thumb.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;DeArment, Robert K. ''Jim Courtright of Fort Worth: His Life and Legend''. Texas Christian University Press; First edition (August 4, 2004). p. 234. {{ISBN|978-0875652924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath and legacy ==

Short was tried for the shooting, but it was ruled justified [[self defense]], and the charges were dismissed. The gunfight gained notoriety due to the reputation of both men. Unfortunately for Courtright, that [[Celebrity|fame]] was [[Wiktionary:posthumous|posthumous]].&lt;ref name="tchj"&gt;[http://www.tchj.com/badblood.html tchj.com Bad Blood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312211630/http://www.tchj.com/badblood.html |date=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Courtright's reputation for strong-arming local businesses with his ''protection'' service, he did reduce Fort Worth's murder rate by more than half the previous level during his time there as the marshal. He built a small force that included himself and two deputies which eventually grew into today's Fort Worth police force.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== Film portrayals ==

In 1955, the half-hour [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Stories of the Century]]'', starring [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]] as railroad detective Matt Clark, aired the Jim Courtright story, with [[Robert Knapp (actor)|Robert Knapp]] in the title role and [[Wally Cassell]] as Luke Short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/stories-of-the-century/jim-courtright-113788/|title=''Stories of the Century'': "Jim Courtright"|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Karl Swenson]] was cast in an historically inaccurate portrayal of Courtright on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] western series, ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]],'' starring [[Wayde Preston]]. In the episode entitled "Long Odds", Swenson plays a grandfather visiting his 10-year-old grandson Billy, played by child actor Paul Engle. Billy has told his friends of his grandfather's prowess with a gun, but the elderly Courtright now shuns a confrontation with the gunfighter Cherry Lane, played by [[Robert J. Wilke]], amid accusations of cowardice. The real Courtright was dead at thirty-nine and likely had no grandchildren. In the ''Colt .45'' episode, Swenson was fifty when he portrayed Courtright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0544328/|title="Long Odds", ''Colt .45'', April 11, 1958|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm|title=''Colt .45''|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Johannes Henricus Brand''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|GCMG}} (popularly known as '''Jan Brand''' and sometimes as '''John Henry Brand''' or '''Jan Henrick Brand'''&lt;ref name="CBD"&gt;{{CBD|214}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (6 December 1823, [[Cape Town]] &amp;ndash; 14 July 1888, [[Bloemfontein]]) was a South African lawyer and politician, and the fourth [[president|state president]] of the [[Orange Free State]], from 2 February 1864 until his death in [[1888 in South Africa|1888]]. He was the son of [[Sir Christoffel Brand|Sir Christoffel Joseph Brand]] (1797–1875), [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] of the [[Cape colony|Cape]] [[legislative assembly]], and Catharina Fredrica Küchler.
Johannes Brand married in 1851 to [[Johanna Sibella Zastron]], a daughter of the [[Registrar of Deeds]] in [[Cape Town]]. The couple had 8 sons and 3 daughters.

==Life history==
[[Image:JHBrand VA1026.jpg|thumb|left|President J.H. Brand, ''c.'' 1864]]
Johannes Brand was born in [[Cape Town]], and was educated at the [[South African College]] in that city. Continuing his studies at [[University of Leiden|Leiden]] in the [[Netherlands]], he took the degree of D.C.L. in 1845. He continued his law studies in Britain and was called to the English [[bar (law)|bar]] at the [[Inner Temple]] in [[1849 in South Africa|1849]].

After his return to South Africa Brand settled in Cape Town, where he practised as an [[advocate]] in the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] until [[1863 in South Africa|1863]].
In 1858 Brand was appointed [[professor of law]] in the [[South African College]]. As a young Member of the [[Cape Parliament]], he became a keen supporter of [[John Molteno]]'s "[[Responsible Government]]" movement, which advocated greater independence from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Bond J.: ''They were South Africans''. London: Oxford University Press. 1956. Chapter 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, finding its principles too moderate, he decided to emigrate to the [[Orange Free State]], in solidarity with its strong [[republic]]an ideals.

He was elected president of the [[Orange Free State]] in 1863, and subsequently re-elected for five year terms in 1869, 1874, 1879 and 1884. In 1864 he resisted the pressure of the [[Basuto]] on the Free State boundary, and after vainly endeavouring to induce [[Moshesh]], the Basuto chief, to keep his people within bounds, he took up arms against them in 1865. This first war ended in the [[Treaty of Thaba Bosigo]], signed on 3 April 1866; and a second war, which ended in the [[Treaty of Aliwal North]], concluded on 12 February 1869. In 1871 he opposed the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[annexation]] of the town of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] without success.

In 1871 Brand was solicited by a large party to become president of the [[South African Republic]] (Transvaal), and thus unite the two [[Boer]] republics of South Africa; but as the project was hostile to [[Great Britain]] he declined to do so, and maintained his constant policy of neutrality towards England, where his merits were recognised in 1882 when he was awarded the [[GCMG|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]].

Johannes Brand was deeply religious and irreproachable in both public and private life. He was extremely popular with the [[citizen|burghers]] of the [[Orange Free State]]. Brand's expression ''"alles zal recht komen als elkeen zijn plicht doet"'' (all will be well if everyone does his duty) has entered the Afrikaans language as a well-known and often used saying. After his death a statue funded by public subscription was erected in [[Bloemfontein]]. The main road in the Bloemfontein city centre was named "President Brand" in his honour.

Brand was a [[Freemasonry in South Africa| South African Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.litnet.co.za/vrymesselary-voor-die-aanvang-van-die-suid-afrikaanse-oorlog/ |title=(Afrikaans) Vrymesselary voor die aanvang van die Suid Afrikaanse oorlog (translated: freemasonary before the start of the South African war)|accessdate=12 September 2018|publisher=Litnet|author=van der Merwe, J.J.P.|date= 12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autobiography==
Just under two weeks after the death of her de facto husband, Lewis Moran, Judy Moran signed with celebrity agent [[Harry M.

==Murder of Desmond Moran==
On 15 June 2009 Moran's brother-in-law [[Moran family#Des_Moran|Des Moran]] (commonly known as "Tuppence") and brother of Lewis, was shot dead in [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|Ascot Vale]]. On 16 June, Judy Moran and three others were arrested in connection with his murder. Those arrested include 45-year-old Suzanne Kane, sister-in-law of Moran's deceased son Jason Moran and daughter of [[Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union|Painter and Docker]] Les Kane, an associate of Lewis Moran who was murdered in his family home on 19 October 1978. Moran and Kane were subsequently charged with being an accessory after the fact and Kane's partner, 43-year-old Geoffrey Amour, was arrested in [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]] and charged with murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25645563-601,00.html Four people arrested over killing of Des Moran], ''The Australian'', 16 June, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth person arrested was later released without charge.

At an out-of-sessions bail hearing in the evening of 16 June, police alleged Moran concealed the getaway car in her garage and later disposed of it in Mincha Street, [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]]. Police had her under surveillance and she was arrested as she walked back to her home. Police discovered a rifle in the abandoned car and white gloves Moran was allegedly seen wearing while driving the car were found discarded in bushes nearby. On executing a warrant on Moran's home, police allegedly discovered a hidden safe containing three hand guns, two stolen Victorian licence plates, a wig and clothing which police claim matches witness descriptions of clothing worn by the gunmen.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Paul, [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25647210-661,00.html Judy Moran and three others charged over Desmond Moran killing], ''Herald Sun'', 16 June, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Moran was remanded into custody on 16 June and later that night her home in Ascot Vale was set on fire in an apparent [[arson]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;Rout, Milanda [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25649475-601,00.html Judy Moran expected to make bail application after house set on fire], ''The Australian'', 17 June, 2009. &lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17 June 2009, Moran and Suzanne Kane appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. Bail was denied on the grounds that their access to weapons represented a danger to the community and remanded them into custody to reappear on 9 September.&lt;ref&gt;Rout, Milanda; Wilson, Lauren, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,25652982-5006785,00.html Judy Moran denied bail over gun bust] ''The Australian'', 18 June, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2009, Kane's partner, Geoffrey Amour, faced Melbourne Magistrates' Court charged with murder. He was also remanded to reappear on 9 September and magistrate Dan Muling granted his lawyer's application for an order suppressing publication of Amour's image. Amour would later plead guilty.&lt;ref name=age030911/&gt;

On 9 March 2011, a jury found Judy Moran guilty of murdering Desmond Moran,&lt;ref name="conviction"/&gt; and was sentenced on 10 August 2011 to 26 years' jail, with a minimum of 21.&lt;ref name=abc081011&gt;{{cite web|last=Farnsworth|first=Sarah|title=Judy Moran jailed for 26 years|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-10/judy-moran-sentence-crime-matriarch-/2832570|publisher=abc.net.au|accessdate=10 August 2011|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzanne Kane was sentenced on 2 February 2011 to two years' jail, suspended for two years.&lt;ref name=age030911/&gt;

'''Justus Velsius, Haganus''', or ''Joost Welsens'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (c. 1510, [[The Hague]], [[Low Countries]]{{#tag:ref|De Wal suggested that Velsius may have been from [[Heeg]], [[Friesland]] instead.&lt;ref name="De_Wal"&gt;{{cite book |last=  de Wal |first=  J. |title= Nederlanders, studenten te Heidelberg |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-Jh_DH3xx1IC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year= 1886 |publisher= E.J.

Velsius started his career as a highly respected professor of [[liberal arts]] in Leuven, Strasbourg, and Cologne. Later on he portrayed himself as a prophet, and promoted his own particular view of Christianity, outlined in a pamphlet "Christiani Hominis Norma" which he wrote in London. He came into conflict with civil and ecclesiastical authorities all over Europe, and spent his final years as a preacher and faith healer in his native Holland. While in Cologne Velsius was married to Beatrix van Steenhoven, and later on, in Groningen, to Grete Cassens.

After studying [[Liberal arts|arts]] and medicine in [[Bologna]], Velsius graduated as [[Doctor of Medicine|doctor medicinae]] in 1538 and settled down as physician in [[Antwerp]], 1540/41. In 1541 he moved to [[Leuven]], where he met [[Portugal|Portuguese]] humanist [[Damião de Góis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feist-Hirsch |first= Elisabeth |title= Damião de Gois: the life and thought of a Portuguese humanist, 1502-1574 |trans-title=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=v2IURME9XY4C&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year= 1967 |publisher= Martinus Nijhoff |location= The Hague |isbn= 90-247-0195-3 |oclc= 1129338 |page= 57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained friendly relations with [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Andreas Vesalius, the reformer of anatomy|author=Ball, J.M.|date=1910|publisher=Medical science press|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nw4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage|page=71|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Velsius did not have a university position he held public lectures in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Renaissance philosophy|philosophy]] and mathematics. In 1544 he proposed a course on [[George of Trebizond|Trebizond]]'s ''Dialectica''. The authorities balked, and in the ensuing controversy they forced Velsius, whose theological purity was suspect, out of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Monfasani |first= John |title= George of Trebizond: a biography and a study of his rhetoric and logic |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qiQbRJw_nLEC&amp;lpg=PA336&amp;pg=PA336#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year= 1976 |publisher= Brill |location= Leiden |isbn= 90-04-04370-5 |oclc= 185923822 |page= 336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1542 he had failed in his bid to succeed [[Petrus Nannius|Nannius]], and he moved to [[Strasbourg]] in 1544 at the recommendation of [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], after a short teaching stint at the [[Gymnasium Philippinum|Marburg Latin School]] and possibly in [[Basel]].

===Strasbourg===
From Easter 1644-50 Velsius taught [[dialectic]] and [[Aristotelian ethics]] in the higher grades of the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Strasbourg, as a co-worker of [[Johannes Sturm]]. On November 17, 1545 he received a [[Canon (priest)|canon]]icate at [[St. Thomas, Strasbourg|St. Thomas]] [[collegiate church]], through the mediation of Bucer. Some time before October 17, 1548, he married Beatrix van Steenhoven. When Velsius got in trouble because he accepted the [[Augsburg Interim|Interim]] and the resulting conflict with his Protestant colleagues, he moved to [[Cologne]] in the spring of 1550; he probably only gave up his Strasbourg canonicate in 1553.

===Cologne: prosecuted by the Inquisition===
Velsius matriculated at Cologne on June 3, 1550. The Council of Cologne wanted to build a [[Collegium Trilingue|Trilingual school]] following the example of the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]], and appointed Velsius professor of philosophy and Greek, in August 1550. Since Velsius was married, he could not obtain a university [[prebend]], but was instead remunerated by the council. His compensation was increased in 1551 and 1552, and he was charged with teaching mathematics as well. Velsius and his colleague [[Jakob Leichius]], who was instrumental in establishing the [[Dreikönigsgymnasium|Gymnasium Tricoronatum]], drafted guidelines for a curriculum of eight grades, similar to Sturm’s humanistic curriculum in Strasbourg.

Velsius attended the meetings of the [[Anabaptist]]s in the [[Bookbinder]]'s [[Guild]]hall at the Pfaffengasse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rembert |first= Karl |title= Die "Wiedertäufer" im Herzogtum Jülich |trans-title=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7HARAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year= 1899 |publisher= R.

Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who had become involved at the instigation of the [[cathedral chapter]], the clergy and the university, urged the council in vain to take action against Velsius, who on March 25, 1555 had published a defense, ''Epistola ad Ferdinandum''.{{Ref|Epistola1555|[works 14]}} Only after Velsius attempted to give theological lectures at his home, and rejected the [[Eucharistic adoration]] and [[celibacy]], did the magistrate banish him in April 1555.

Velsius refused to leave, and went voluntarily in detention, from December 1555 to the end of March 1556. He asked his influential friend [[Viglius]] to support him, but Viglius declined to get involved. Greatly offended by this refusal, Velsius apparently accused his friend of Protestant leanings, and severed all connections with his former friend. Because of this precedent the council adopted in 1555 a comprehensive directive against all heretics.

The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[John Slotanus|Johannes Slotanus]] served as papal [[inquisitor]] for the [[Ecclesiastical province]] of [[Mainz]], Cologne and [[Trier]] against Velsius and three other imprisoned people, whom he described as [[Anabaptist]]s. The Protestant [[Fürst|Prince]]s intervened at the council on his behalf, in particular [[Christopher of Oldenburg|Christoph von Oldenburg]]. Since in December 1555 he had declared to adhere to the [[Augsburg Confession]], Velsius was protected by the recently concluded [[Peace of Augsburg]]. On the night of 26 to 27 March 1556 he was taken by boat across [[Rhine|the river]] and put ashore on the other side, in the [[Berg (state)|Duchy of Berg]]. From there he made it to [[Mülheim, Cologne|Mülheim]], where he wrote ''Apologia'', addressed to the Emperor Charles and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Ferdinand]].{{Ref|Apologia|[works 15]}} Slotanus replied in 1557 with the ''Apologia JV Hagani Confutatio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Slotanus |first= Joannes |authorlink= John Slotanus |title= Apologiae Iusti Velsii Hagani, confutatio |url= http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0003/bsb00035681/image_5 |year= 1557 |publisher= Jasp. Gennepaeus |location= Coloniae |language= Latin |oclc= 166109991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Velsius wrote in September 1557 the ''Epistolae''.{{Ref|Epistolae|[works 16]}} 1558 followed Slotanus' ''Disputationes adversus haereticos liber unus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Slotan |first= Johann |authorlink= John Slotanus |title= Disputationum Adversus haereticos Liber unus : In quo sub propugnatione articulorum Iusto Velsio Coloniae propositorum omnes ferme huius seculi controuersiae discutiuntur |url= http://www.bsb-muenchen-digital.de/~web/web1019/bsb10194668/images/index.html?digID=bsb10194668&amp;pimage=00005&amp;v=100&amp;md=0&amp;nav=0&amp;l=en |year= 1558 |publisher= Bathenius |location= Coloniae |language= Latin |oclc= 644086668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frankfurt: disputation with Calvin===
{{Portal|Calvinism}} Velsius arrived in [[Frankfurt]] on July 15, 1556,&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Martin Bucer, Etudes Sur Les Relations de Bucer Avec Les Pays-Bas. II. Documents|author=Pollet, J.V.|date=1985|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004075658|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dcEM1loYrHAC&amp;pg=PA331#v=onepage|page=331|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; approached [[Robert Horne (bishop)|Robert Horne]], pastor of the [[Marian exiles|English Church]], and informed him of the revelations on which he wished to conduct a public dispute. Hearing of the arrival of [[John Calvin|Calvin]], who came to arbitrate conflicts within the [[Huguenot|French Refugee Church]], he offered the latter to preside. He proposed to defend the [[Free will in theology|free will]] against the Calvinist doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]]. The [[Disputation|debate]] with Calvin, [[Jan Łaski|Johannes à Lasco]] and Horne lasted two days; Velsius' argument boiled down to this: ''aut esse liberum arbitrium, aut Deum tyrannum esse'' (Either there is free will, or God is a tyrant).

In a letter addressed to [[Melanchthon]], dated September 17, 1556, Calvin commented as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been dragged hither by the dissentions with which Satan has rent, for nearly two years, the little French church established here, and reduced to such extremities that it must have disappeared, unless some remedy had been very promptly applied. Since I entered the town I have not had a moment’s repose, and as if I had not had sufficient occupation in this affair, a madman called Velsius, to whom you had written twice, involved us in new fooleries. But we have devoted only two days to this importunity. I am continually distracted up to this moment, in appeasing those dissentions which, from the long lapse of time, have struck deep root.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=John Calvin:Selections from His Writings: Selections from His Writings|author1=Calvin, J.|author2=Dillenberger, J.|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780891300250|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=565YJFyxZ80C&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage|page=60|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On April 15, 1557 Velsius was expelled by the Council of Frankfurt.

===Heidelberg: trouble with the Kurfürst===
August 5, 1557 Velsius matriculated at Heidelberg,&lt;ref name="De_Wal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Drüll |first= Dagmar |title= Heidelberger Gelehrtenlexikon |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jTpjQyaqNY4C&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year= 2002 |publisher= Springer |location= Berlin: Heidelberg |language= German |isbn= 3-540-43530-1 |oclc= 24849061 |page= 150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained a license to give public lectures in philosophy. In June 1558 this license was revoked by the Senate of the University at the orders of [[Otto Henry, Elector Palatine|Kurfürst Ottheinrich]] because he spread theses that were against the Holy Scriptures. Velsius attacked the pastor of the [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Heiliggeistkirche]], [[Johann Flinner]], on his position on the [[Eucharist]], sent him a series of theses on [[Born again (Christianity)|new birth]] and [[Free will in theology|free will]], and accused the pastor of being a false apostle and misleader of the prince and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Marbach |first= Johann |title= Der Antheil der Strassburger an der Reformation in Churpfalz |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pskCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year= 1856 |publisher= C.F. Schmidt |location= Strassburg |language= German |oclc= 42081608 |pages= xxxvii-lxiii }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1559 he was also disallowed to give private lectures, after intervention of [[Frederick III, Elector Palatine|Kurfürst Friedrich III]], and was expelled by the Senate of the University. Velsius [[Shaking the dust from the feet|shook the dust off his shoes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|10:14-15|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|6:11-13|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|9:5-6|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|13:51-52|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Büttinghausen |first= Karl |title= Beyträge zur Pfälzischen Geschichte |url= http://www.bsb-muenchen-digital.de/~web/web1037/bsb10371894/images/index.html?digID=bsb10371894&amp;pimage=00279&amp;v=100&amp;md=0&amp;nav=0&amp;l=en |volume= 1 |year= 1776 |publisher= Tobias Löffler |location= Mannheim |language= German |oclc= 165944546 |pages= 277–282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1560 Velsius was back in Frankfurt. He asked the council for permission to have a book printed he had written ''die Summa christlicher Lehre und Lebens'' (''The Summary of Christian Doctrine and Life''). The council referred his request to the Lutheran pastors, who on August 2, 1560 reported back that his book contained theses that were against orthodox doctrine. They also expressed concern that these doctrines could lead to unrest in the foreign churches in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Frankfurter Verein für Geschichte und Landeskunde, Verein für Geschichte und Altertumskunde in Frankfurt am Main |title= Archiv für Frankfurts Geschichte und Kunst, Volume 2, Issues 5-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=chQKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year= 1858 |publisher= Heinrich Keller |location= Frankfurt |language= German |oclc= 1481953 |pages= 79–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as had [[Münster Rebellion|happened in Münster]]. On March 18, 1561 the council ordered Velsius to leave the city, since he had his book printed without permission. The innkeeper where he was boarding, Hansen Braun, was told to no longer allow him to stay in his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Frankfurter Verein für Geschichte und Landeskunde |title= Archiv für Frankfurts Geschichte und Kunst, Issues 45-47 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_AkPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year= 1860 |publisher= Gesellschaft für Frankfurts Geschichte und Kunst |location= Frankfurt |language= German |oclc= 470721818 |page= 255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1561 Velsius was in Strasbourg. He wrote to Flinner (who had returned from Heidelberg) and the preachers, and to the council as well, submitting 20 propositions, probably the same ones as he announced in Heidelberg and in Frankfurt. These were not accepted, since they disagreed with the [[catechism]] then in use in Strasbourg.

A month later, in June 1561, Velsius was in Basel. He was luckier there, at least he could count on [[Sebastian Castellio]], with whom he had corresponded before, and advocates of tolerance such as [[Martin Cellarius|Cellarius]] and [[Celio Secondo Curione]]. He submitted a summary to the Council of the University, who considered it on June 16. The council forwarded it to the Faculty of Theology, since it was outside their area of expertise. [[Martin Cellarius|Cellarius]] proposed a number of theses for an academic [[disputation]], but Velsius declined after the council had refused a public debate.

On June 25 Velsius departed for [[Zürich]], where he arrived the next day. He wrote to the council, and [[Heinrich Bullinger|Bullinger]] responded on behalf of the council, pointing out that his criticism didn't apply since it was directed at Luther and at the Roman Catholic Church. On July 4 Velsius had left town.

On August 1 Velsius was back in Heidelberg, where he wrote a last time to [[Bonifacius Amerbach]] and to [[Johannes Sturm]]. He matriculated in [[Marburg]] at the end of August 1561, where he lectured at the medical school. However, he remained only a few months in Marburg.

===London: more religious turmoil===
In 1563, Velsius had crossed the [[English Channel|Channel]] to [[England]] where he joined the [[Dutch Church, Austin Friars|Dutch Church]] in [[London]]. Again he sought controversy, this time with [[Nicolaus Carinaeus]], the minister of the Dutch refugee church, who had died from the plague the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= van Toorenenbergen |first= J.

Velsius opposed him publicly developing at length his idea that the perfection of Adam could be reached on earth after [[Born again (Christianity)|inner rebirth]] had taken place in the individual. Velsius wrote a summary of his religion ''Christiani Hominis Norma'' (''The Rule of a Christian Man''), in which he explained his notion that through [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] man could become God-in-man, like Christ. He sent copies of this pamphlet to the Bishop of London [[Edmund Grindal]], to Secretary of State [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], and to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. [[File:Justus Velsius to Queen Elizabeth.JPG|right|thumb|380px|Justus Velsius' signature on his letter to Queen Elizabeth]] He also wrote a letter to the French Ambassador denouncing the vengeance of God on all who refused to receive his propositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Strype |first= John |authorlink= John Strype |title= The history of the life and acts of the Most Reverend Father in God, Edmund Grindal, the first Bishop of London |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Mp965368HU0C&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year= 1821 |publisher= Clarendon Press |location= Oxford |oclc= 15137458 |pages= 135–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter to the Queen, Velsius claimed to have confirmed his calling by performing miracles. The servant to the ambassador, Cosmus, fasted five or six days by Velsius' persuasion that after his abstinence he might receive ''illuminations a coelo''. According to Grindal in the end he fell mad, so neither of those miracles stood the test of further investigation. Bishop Grindal wrote a rebuttal, showing that Velsius' teachings were against orthodox doctrine. Velsius was summoned before the ecclesiastical commission, consisting of Bishop Grindal, the Bishop of Winchester [[Robert Horne (bishop)|Robert Horne]], and the Dean of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]] [[Alexander Nowell]], who had a frank discussion with him, and charged him in the Queen's name to leave the kingdom. This he complained of in very rude words to the Queen, and predicted the death of the bishop of Winchester and other important public figures.{{#tag:ref|Velsius' ''Christiani Hominis Norma'', and his letters to Grindal, Queen Elizabeth, the French Ambassador, Cecil, and related papers from Grindal have been placed online on the website of the University of Hull, [http://www.sp12.hull.ac.uk/image/image28.htm Volume 28] March–May 1563. Included is a letter to Calvin with propositions contrary to Calvin's doctrines, with Horne's response; these may be the theses used at the Frankfurt disputation.

===Imprisoned in Groningen===
Velsius returned to his native Holland, in April 1566 he was [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. In 1574 he was in prison there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Reitsma |first= J. |year= 1894 |title= Dr. Justus Velsius in Groningen |journal= Groningsche Volksalmanak. |pages=56–74 |publisher= E.B. van der Kamp |location= Groningen |oclc= 39941293 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=O7AOAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;ots=_ivzBBONhr&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |language= Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably because of religious reasons. The authorities felt sorry for him, because he was an elderly gentleman, and apparently depressed. They therefore proposed to release him, also because of the hardship imprisonment caused him and his wife Grete Cassens, as they had to provide for his own cost of living. The proposal was considered by the [[Stadtholder]] [[Caspar de Robles|de Robles]], who had a conversation with Velsius, and referred it to the bishop, who charged the dean of the cathedral to look into it. On August 24, 1574 the bishop endorsed Velsius' release. However, Velsius refused to leave prison, because he only wanted to be released by God's grace, not by human intervention. This unusual situation lasted until May 1575, when [[Caspar de Robles|de Robles]] required the jail to be vacated, since the adjacent castle had to be strengthened and readied for the garrison.

===Faith healer in Holland===
In April 1570 he was again in Cologne and then traveled through the Netherlands as a Protestant preacher. In 1578, 1580 and 1581 he was in Leiden. Place and year of death are unknown.

==Work==
Velsius published the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of [[Proclus]]'s ''De Motu'' (''On Motion''), along with a [[Latin]] translation.{{Ref|Proclus|[works 5]}}

==Theology==
Justus Velsius is interesting because his life reflects so well the unsettled intellectual conditions of 16th-century Europe. His theological profile in the religious landscape is not clearly defined: first, he did not agree with [[Martin Luther|Luther]]’s dogma of "[[sola fide]]" and instead held on to the free will of man; on the other hand, he supported the Lutheran [[Eucharist]] and rejected [[transubstantiation]]. Also, Velsius cannot be identified as Anabaptist, and is distinct from [[German mysticism|Spiritualism]]. What sets Velsius apart is that he taught [[Justification (theology)|justification]] by [[Born again (Christianity)|new birth]], not by [[Forgiveness of Sins|forgiveness of sins]]. He thought of himself as a messenger of God, sent to warn people for eternal [[damnation]], and claimed to be able to confirm his teachings by [[miracle]]s.

It has been suggested that Velsius may have known [[Michael Servetus|Servetus]], since both were close to [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]]. Velsius' position about predestination is reminiscent of Servetus', and it is noteworthy that the Calvin-Velsius [[disputation]] on this subject took place less than three years after Servetus was executed outside [[Geneva]]. Rembert suggests that Velsius may have known [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[Anabaptist]] religious reformer [[Johann Campanus]], or at the very least that they were aware of each other's work.

Velsius' teachings appear to be related to those of the [[Familia Caritatis|Family of Love]]. Velsius was a contemporary of [[Henry Nicholis|Hendrik Niclaes]], the founder of the Family of Love, and it seems likely that they may have known each other.

'''Kevin Mark Clarke''' is a [[perennial candidate]] for public office in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. He was also one of the most recognizable [[homeless]] persons in the city{{dubious|date=September 2011}}, campaigning on the issues he has advocated for most of his life- "the people's rights". He is the leader of [[The People's Political Party]].

Clarke advocates for comprehensive reform in the criminal justice system, to create a system which prevents recidivism among first-time offenders. He has proposed a program which he claims would reduce the recidivism which allegedly violent prison environments create: 'The Inmate Monitored Education System' otherwise known as T.I.M.E., which would aim to help eliminate the claimed harmful influence of prison life on first-time offenders.

He also campaigns strongly on the issues of poverty and homelessness.

A former student teacher for Grade 5 at Chester Le Junior Public School in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] in the 1980s, Clarke credits that period in his life as his most rewarding experience.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Biography==
Clarke worked in the automobile business during the early 1990s. He sought election as Mayor of [[East York]] in the [[Toronto municipal election, 1994|1994 municipal election]], describing himself as an "advertising consultant, political rebel and welfare recipient". He promised to resign after three months if elected, and to form a provincial party for ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', 10 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke first campaigned for the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] in the [[Ontario general election, 1995|1995 general election]], challenging [[New Democratic Party of Ontario|New Democratic Party]] [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Bob Rae]] in [[York South (provincial electoral district)|York South]]. He received 170 votes, finishing seventh in a field of nine candidates. During this election, Clarke vowed to oppose the "pimps" of government who "live off the avails of the people".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', 5 June 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke campaigned for York South again in 1996 after Rae retired from the legislature, and finished last in a field of six candidates with 70 votes. The winner was [[Gerard Kennedy]] of the [[Ontario Liberal Party]].

He sought election to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]], and finished sixth out of eight candidates in [[Broadview—Greenwood]] with 211 votes. The winner was [[Dennis Mills]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. During this election, Clarke described himself as a salesman and a businessman.

He became homeless in 1998, after his auto business failed. For the next seven years, he frequently sang and preached on the streets of Toronto while wearing long, flowing robes. He was also actively involved in public affairs, and was a member of the Toronto Disaster Relief Committee.

Clarke ran for the Ontario legislature a third time in a by-election for [[Beaches—East York (provincial electoral district)|Beaches—East York]] on September 20, 2001. He finished sixth out of eight candidates with 94 votes. The winner was [[Michael Prue]] of the New Democratic Party.

Clarke campaigned for Mayor of Toronto in the [[Toronto municipal election, 2000|2000]],  [[Toronto municipal election, 2003|2003]] and [[Toronto municipal election, 2006|2006]] municipal elections, and ran for [[Toronto City Council]] in by-elections held in 1998 and 2001. His primary issues were street and water safety, though he also emphasized anti-drug policies. He ran his 2001 campaign out of a homeless shelter which he used every night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Atkinson |coauthors= |title=KEVIN CLARKE:He's concerned about the quality of drinking water |url=http://observer.thecentre.centennialcollege.ca/news/clarke113001.htm |quote= |pages= |work=Toronto Observer |location= |date=November 30, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214221548/http://observer.thecentre.centennialcollege.ca/news/clarke113001.htm |archivedate=2005-12-14 |accessdate=2014-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1998 campaign, his age was listed as thirty-four.&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', 29 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

He took part in an unusual protest during the 2003 campaign, by tearing up pieces of a telephone book and scattering them to the wind during lunch hour at a busy Toronto intersection. "You care if there's paper on the street," he said to passers-by, "but you don't care if there's people on the street".&lt;ref&gt;''National Post'', 11 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He also described himself as an "ex-con, ex-drug dealer and ex-teacher".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', 6 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke finally found housing again in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_05.26.05/city/clarke.html http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_05.26.05/city/clarke.html] November 4, 2005{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked as an actor during this period.&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', 4 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a candidate running for the 2010 Toronto mayoral election. Clarke has been known to employ eccentric tactics to reach the public during his campaign, including speeches while aboard the [[Toronto Transit Commission|TTC]].

In the [[Ontario general election, 2011|2011 Ontario election]] he ran as leader of the [[People's Political Party of Ontario|People's Political Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.on.ca/en-CA/CandidatesAndParties/PoliticalParties/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602024237/http://elections.on.ca/en-CA/CandidatesAndParties/PoliticalParties/ |archivedate=2014-06-02 |df= }} Elections Ontario&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Clarke emphatically stated to [[Peter Tabuns]], during an all-candidates debate on education held on September 20, 2011, that he does not endorse the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Clarke ran for Mayor in the [[Toronto mayoral election, 2018|2018 election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://app.toronto.ca/vote/searchCandidateByLastName.do?criteria.startWithLastName=C | title=Elections - City of Toronto - List of Candidates| accessdate=July 30, 2018| archive-date=July 30, 2018| deadurl=no| archive-url=http://app.toronto.ca/vote/exportAllCandidates.do?type=byStartWithLastName&amp;value=C | website=toronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where he finished with 3,853 votes.

{{nihongo|'''Lelouch vi Britannia'''|ルルーシュ・ヴィ・ブリタニア|Rurūshu vi Buritania}}, whose alias is {{nihongo|'''Lelouch Lamperouge'''|ルルーシュ・ランペルージ|Rurūshu Ranperūji}}, is the [[title character]] and [[protagonist]] of the [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] [[anime]] series ''[[Code Geass|Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion]]''. In the series, Lelouch is a former prince from the superpower Britannia who is given the power of the "Geass" by a witch known as [[C.C. (Code Geass)|C.C.]] Using the Geass and his [[genius]]-level intellect, Lelouch becomes the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights under his [[alter ego]] {{nihongo|'''Zero'''|ゼロ}} to destroy the Holy Britannian Empire, an imperial monarchy that has been conquering various countries under control from his father. His Japanese voice actor is [[Jun Fukuyama]], and his child self is voiced by [[Sayaka Ohara]]. His English dub voice is provided by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] with [[Michelle Ruff]] doing Lelouch's child voice.

Lelouch was designed by the group of [[mangaka|manga artists]] [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]], who aimed to create a stylish and visually appealing character. The character of Lelouch has been recognized as one of Japan's most popular characters during the time ''Code Geass'' aired, appearing at the top of several polls. Publications for anime and manga saw Lelouch as an interesting character. Despite his ruthless methods to destroy an empire, he still has several strong relationships that made him a likeable character. His voice actors Fukuyama and Bosch have been praised for their work as Lelouch's voice.

==Creation and design==
[[File:Lelouchearlydesigns.jpg|thumb|left|Early designs of Lelouch and his alter ego, Zero, (top right), by Clamp.]]
While designing the concept art for Lelouch, the series' original character designers, [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]], had initially conceived of his hair color as being white.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Code Geass x CLAMP: Mutuality|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|year=2008|page=48|author=Clamp}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanase Ohkawa]], head writer at Clamp, said she had visualized him as being a character to which "everyone" could relate to as being "cool", literally, a "beauty". While developing the character during the initial planning stages, the series' core staff at Sunrise, director [[Gorō Taniguchi]], writer [[Ichirō Ōkouchi]], and the production team discussed numerous possible influences for the character with Clamp, such as the Japanese idol duos [[KinKi Kids]] and [[Tackey &amp; Tsubasa]].&lt;ref name="newtypemay2007interview"&gt;{{cite book | title=''[[Newtype]]'', May 2007 issue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early planning stages for Lelouch's alter ego, "Zero", Clamp had wanted to create a mask never witnessed prior in any Sunrise series.&lt;ref name="newtypemay2007interview"/&gt; Zero was one of the earliest developed characters. Ōkouchi wanted a mask to be included as a part of the series, because he felt that a mask was necessary for it to be a Sunrise show.&lt;ref name="ōkouchi-interview"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Ichirō Ōkouchi|work=Code Geass DVD Volume 1|publisher=[[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early designs of the character, Zero possessed long silver nails.&lt;ref name="artbook"/&gt;

==Appearances==
===In ''Code Geass''===
====First season====
Lelouch is introduced in the first episode of the series as a student of Ashford Academy, where he is a member of its student council. He accidentally boards a truck used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding a witch known as [[C.C. (Code Geass)|C.C.]] (pronounced "Cee Two"), who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. offers him the "Power of the King", the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question.&lt;ref name="ep1"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Stage 1: The Day The Fiend Was Born | series = Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion  | network = MBS | airdate = 2006-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Britannian Empire, starting by killing his half-brother, [[Clovis la Britannia]], after extracting information about the murder of his mother, Marianne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The False Classmate|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|network=MBS|airdate=October 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He takes up the identity of Zero and later forms the Order of the Black Knights, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=His Name is Zero|titlelink=List of Code Geass episodes|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|serieslink=Code Geass|network=MBS|airdate=October 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Black Knights|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|network=MBS|airdate=November 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turning point in his rebellion comes when his half-sister, [[Euphemia li Britannia]], declares the region under Mount Fuji the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she says she plans to give up her royal title, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, at this moment his Geass permanently activates without him knowing, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese causes Euphemia to do just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Bloodstained Euphy|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|network=MBS|airdate=March 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lelouch reluctantly kills her and uses the massacre as an excuse to spark the Black Rebellion, in which he declares Japan to be an independent nation and leads an attack on the Tokyo Settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=At Least with Sorrow|titlelink=List of Code Geass episodes|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|serieslink=Code Geass|network=MBS|airdate=March 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally has been kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the better-organized Britannian military. Lelouch makes his way to Kamine Island to search for Nunnally, but is confronted by Suzaku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Zero|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|network=MBS|airdate=July 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season reveals that Lelouch is defeated by Suzaku, who arrests his former friend and brings him to his father.

====''Akito The Exiled''====
After Suzaku brings Lelouch to Charles, he offers to hand him over on the condition he be inducted into the Knights of the Round, much to Lelouch's dismay. Charles agrees, and uses his Geass to alter Lelouch's mind. With this, Lelouch becomes the empire's slave, Julius Kingsley, wearing an eyepatch over his Geass.

Lelouch makes a few appearances in the miniseries, first seen in Suzaku's custody as he clutches his right eye while begging his friend for water, only to be silently turned down. In his second appearance upon arriving in St. Petersburg, Kingsley proudly declares that the Emperor has placed him in charge of all the Eastern front operational planning for Britannia's military.

In the third episode, Lelouch encounters Shin Hyuga Shaing and others for a meeting. In which he tries to arrest the others in his plan. Lelouch showcases a clip to create fear and havoc within the city. Later on, he plays chess along Hyuga, but starts hallucinating Kingsley and past memories from Rebellion. Later on Hyuga figures out that he was both Zero and Lelouch and calls his squad. Suzaku, in an attempt to defend the secret, kills most of the squad whilst Lelouch rips off his eye-patch. Eventually, both are captured, with Hyuga later declaring Kingsley executed and revealing that he is Zero.

From here, Lelouch begins to regain his memories in a traumatized fashion, prompting Suzaku to strangle him, until Lelouch begins to cry and beg Suzaku to kill him. They are saved by [[Rolo Lamperouge]], and from there Charles is forced to use his Geass on Lelouch again. This time, he is unaware of his royal heritage or being Zero, but still lives a life strikingly similar to the one he led at the start of the series.

====Second season====
A year after the Black Rebellion, after the Emperor wiped out his memories, Lelouch is living as an Ashford student with
[[Rolo Lamperouge]] assigned to oversee the delusion under the guise of Lelouch's younger brother. Lelouch's memories are restored by C.C., and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights, gaining Rolo's trust in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Plan for Independent Japan|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|network=MBS|airdate=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Counterattack at the Gallows|titlelink=List of Code Geass episodes|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|serieslink=Code Geass|network=MBS|airdate=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Nunnally is appointed as Governor of Area 11 and announces her plans to reestablish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally's new Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=One Million Miracles|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|serieslink=Code Geass|network=MBS|airdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Knights escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins forging an alliance with the other world powers to create a force that rivals Britannia. He starts by destabilizing the Chinese Federation, returning control to Empress [[List of Code Geass characters#Tianzi|Tianzi]] from the High Eunuchs. Once Lelouch's new alliance, the United Federation of Nations, is formed, their first act is to liberate Japan. Despite Lelouch's desire to protect his sister, his Geass forces Suzaku to shoot a nuclear weapon, destroying a large portion of the Tokyo Settlement and presumably killing Nunnally. Schneizel then convinces the Black Knights to betray him with a despondent Lelouch willing to be killed by his former comrades, until Rolo sacrifices his life to save him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Betrayal|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|network=MBS|airdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lelouch decides to go to Kamine Island and defeat his father. Joined by Suzaku, he learns the truth that his mother faked her death and has been aiding the Emperor in their goal to wipe out individuality from the world. Lelouch, awakening his full Geass powers while rejecting the reality his parents intend, controls the will of the C's World entity itself to erase the Sword of Akasha and his parents out of existence. One month later, Lelouch usurps the Britannian throne and appoints Suzaku as his knight to set the stage for their ultimate plan, the Zero Requiem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Ragnarok Connection|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|network=MBS|airdate=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Emperor, Lelouch dismantles the Britannian class system and frees every colony. He then requests that Britannia join the U.F.N, but proceeds to take the council members hostage after it is revealed that Britannia's large population would give him a majority voting block. This brings him into conflict with Schneizel, who has Nunnally in his custody and commands the ''Damocles'' (a floating fortress which he intends to place into a position which would allow him to fire nuclear weapons worldwide), and the Black Knights now under Kaname Oghi. In the final battle, as Suzaku fakes his death, Lelouch outwits Schneizel and places him under a Geass command to serve Zero. From there, learning that Nunnally has regained her sight and has been acting on her own plan to unite the world through the destruction of the ''Damocles'', Lelouch uses his Geass on her to give him the ''Damocles''' key. With Schenizel and the ''Damocles'' both under his control, Lelouch declares himself the ruler of the world. Two months later, Lelouch arranges for the public execution of the Black Knight leaders and the U.F.N. representatives. It is then, as Nunnally, the U.F.N and the Black Knights learn afterwards, that the Zero Requiem's final phase takes place with Lelouch being killed by Suzaku in the guise of Zero. With his death, Nunnally succeeds her brother as Empress and the world unites in a new era of peace and cooperation. In the spinoff OVA, ''Miraculous Birthday'', he briefly uses his power in the afterlife to say goodbye to Suzaku, Nunnally, Rivalz, Nina, and Kallen before departing.

===In other media===
In ''[[Code Geass#Video games|Code Geass: Lost Colors]]'', the video game for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]], there are a several different endings and clips of Lelouch that involve the main character, [[List of Code Geass characters#Rai|Rai]] who joins the same school. Across the game, the player can make Rai befriend Lelouch. Rai can also become Lelouch's best friend as well as Zero's partner. In the video game ''[[Another Century's Episode: R]]'', Lelouch makes an appearance in his Knightmare Frame, the [[Knightmare Frame#Shinkirō|''Shinkirō'']]. He also appears in the [[Another Century's Episode Portable|spin-off]] with his ''Shinkiro''. Lelouch and the rest of the ''Code Geass'' R1 cast make their debut to the ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' franchise in this game, using their R1 Knightmares.

The ''Code Geass'' manga follows the same basic plot as the anime, but with several differences. Knightmares do not exist.  As for Lelouch's character, he is still the same as he was in the anime. He takes on the identity Zero, but largely focuses on his activities with the Black Knights.

''Nightmare of Nunnally'' features Lelouch's transformation into Zero by merging with C.C. This time the Geass grants Lelouch supernatural strength allowing him to battle the Knightmares in hand-to-hand combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Takuma, Tomomasa|title=Code Geass: Nightmare of Nunnally, volume 3|publisher=Bandai Entertainment|year=2009|isbn=978-1604961614|chapter=Code 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly Lelouch knows the same martial arts as Suzaku. After several fights against Britannia, Zero orders the Black Knights to side with the army to defeat the Emperor as Euphemia is due to take over the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code Geass: Nightmare of Nunnally, volume 4|publisher=Bandai Entertainment|year=2010|isbn=978-1604961621|chapter=Chapter 18|author=Takuma, Tomomasa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Emperor is defeated, Zero's death is announced, as Lelouch inherits C.C.'s name and immortality, becoming C.C. The Demon King and goes forth to spread Geass and to promote conflict around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code Geass: Nightmare of Nunnally, volume 5|publisher=Bandai Entertainment|year=2010|isbn=978-1604962048|chapter=Last Code|author=Takuma, Tomomasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the manga ''Suzaku of the Counterattack'', Lelouch obtains his Geass in the same way as in the anime series, except that his Geass symbol is slightly rendered. Many of the Black Knights are not loyal to Zero and often split off into renegade factions or act without his knowledge. Lelouch is held responsible for a terrorist attack when a Black Knights faction had gone renegade without following his instructions. He later goes to kill his father only to discover that he was already killed by Schneizel, his half-brother; however, it is later revealed to be Schneizel's scheme to get Lelouch executed and to take C.C.'s Code. Near the end of the manga, Lelouch tries to use his Geass on Schneizel, but the latter punctures his left eye, leaving him never to use his Geass again.

In  ''Tales of an Alternate Shogunate'', set in 1853 at the Bakumatsu Era, Lelouch is the commander of the military counterinsurgence brigade known as the Shinsengumi, formed under the orders of the Shogunate to fight the rebel group known as the Black Revolutionaries, but was secretly the leader of that group as Zero and has gained information from within. The event is set in Kyoto, and Lelouch had recently acquired his geass from C.C. and had stolen Britannian's new Knightmare, Gawain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code Geass: Tales of an Alternate Shogunate|publisher=Bandai Entertainment|year=2011|isbn=978-1604962598|author=Takuma, Tomomasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a special ''Code Geass'' Picture Drama episode, Lelouch appears on December 5 for Ashford Academy's school festival, helping Rivalz, now school president, along with some of his friends. However a battle erupts in school grounds by the Neo-Chinese Federation, led by a former eunuch, whom takes everyone hostage. With help of his friends, Lelouch manages to stop the Federation soldiers. In the aftermath, the entire episode is revealed to be a dream which the ghost of Lelouch used to thank everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Code Geass: The Miraculous Birthday (コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ　キセキの誕生日, Kōdo Giasu: Kiseki no Tanjōbi)&lt;/ref&gt; In a special OVA parody episode, based on the ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' story, Lelouch is narrating the story and appears in the role as the Mad Hatter.&lt;ref&gt;Code Geass: Nunnally in Wonderland&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- In the OVA ''Akito the Exiled'', Lelouch appears under the alias of Julius Kingsley, a brainwashed military advisor sent to Euro Britannia from the Britannian homeland.

==Character outline==
Lelouch vi Britannia is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late [[Marianne vi Britannia|Imperial Consort Marianne]], making Lelouch the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire.&lt;ref name="ep3"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Stage 1: The Day a New Demon was Born|titlelink=List of Code Geass episodes|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion|serieslink=Code Geass|network=MBS|airdate=2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was seventeenth in line to the Imperial throne prior to his mother's assassination, an event which also left his sister blind and crippled. His father banished him and his sister [[Nunnally Lamperouge|Nunnally]] to Japan, where they were used as political tools. It was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first met [[Suzaku Kururugi]], who would later become his best friend.&lt;ref name="picdrama1"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Code Geass Picture Drama 1|titlelink=List of Code Geass episodes|series=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD 1|serieslink=Code Geass|airdate=2007-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother's death and his father's apparent unconcern about it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and therefore made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all. Lelouch is an individual who is calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. At school, Lelouch conducts himself as a sociable, likeable, and often easy-going student; however, in reality, this is a mask to hide his true nature. As Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders.

Lelouch possesses very strong philosophical beliefs, which define both his actions and his motivations. Perhaps his most notable is that he rejects his father's beliefs of [[Social Darwinism]]. He believes the world can live in cooperation rather than through conflict and struggle. To achieve this aim, he believes that the ends justify the means; he is willing to commit acts of evil if it means bringing down a greater evil in the process, and is always focused on getting results regardless of the methods used. Lelouch also has strong beliefs concerning death and killing, thinking that one should only kill if they are prepared to die themselves.

===Abilities===
Lelouch's Geass, given to him by C.C., grants him "the power of absolute obedience", allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact, similar to extreme hypnosis. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated in this state are written into the minds of anyone he makes eye contact with. The people under this power obey whatever orders Lelouch gives them. Once it is cast, the orders can neither be changed or canceled, nor are the subjects capable of resisting them. Also, Lelouch can only cast Geass on a person once; afterward, once its conditions have been fulfilled, Lelouch's power won't work on them anymore, unless their initial Geass has been removed by a Geass canceler.

Even without his Geass, Lelouch is a formidable opponent. By using his genius intellect, he is capable of devising and executing strategies with fantastic speed and precision. He rarely battles opponents physically. Instead, he usually attacks with coordinated groups or armies focused under his direct command, or using clever plots, schemes, or deceptions to gain an advantage. He thinks of his battles as chess games, at which he is a masterful player, always beating anyone who played against him. Before he received his Geass power, he often gambles on his chess games against Britannian nobles and other skilled players out of boredom. As a teenager, he makes use of his masterful skills as a commander in real battle, anticipating his enemies' moves and giving orders on how to respond to his forces, and utilizing traps and schemes that were strategically put in place to destroy the enemy. In contrast, his physical state is poor; however, he displays above-average [[hand–eye coordination]], both with firearms and the keyboard-based control system of the ''Shinkirō''. Lelouch is also shown to be very charismatic and persuasive, able to win the support of the populace through well-delivered speeches combined with his ability to make miracles through superior strategic planning. In episode 14 of R2, V.V. remarks that Lelouch is a lot like his father.

[[Image:Shinkiro.jpg|thumb|250px|Lelouch's Knightmare, the [[Knightmare Frame#Shinkirō|''Shinkirō'']]]]
Lelouch usually operates standard Knightmares, but pilots such as Suzaku and Cornelia, both of whom are masterful pilots who use more advanced models, are commonly able to overwhelm him in single combat. Lelouch is typically accompanied by Kallen, who serves as his personal guard. After stealing the advanced model, the [[Knightmare Frame#Gawain|''Gawain'']], Lelouch co-pilots it with C.C., controlling the weapons and command functions while C.C. handles navigation and flight, until it was lost in the ocean, when trying to deal with Jeremiah. After the Black Knights are exiled from Japan, Lelouch pilots the [[Knightmare Frame#Shinkirō|''Shinkirō'']], which has the strongest defense of any Knightmare, but it requires an intellect of his level to perform the complex calculations needed for it to be effective.

==Reception==
[[File:Johnny Yong Bosch.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Johnny Yong Bosch]] has received praise, fans and critics often describe Lelouch as his best role and allowed him to break typecasting.]] 
Lelouch's character has been well received by viewers of the series, appearing in various anime polls. Lelouch was chosen as the most popular male character of 2006, 2007 and 2008 at Animage magazine and ''Newtype'' magazine named him the best anime male character of the decade.&lt;ref name="newtype"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Newtype]] | publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]] | title=Newtype's Top 30 Male and Female Characters of Each Decade | date=March 2010 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was chosen the most popular male character of 2006, 2007, and 2008 at ''[[Animage]]'' magazine's annual [[Animage#Character|Anime Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Animage]] | publisher=[[Gakken]] |issue=6| title=Anime Grand Prix 2006–2007| date=May 2007 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Animage]] | publisher=[[Gakken]] |issue=6| title=Anime Grand Prix 2007–2008| date=May 2008 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Animage]] | publisher=[[Gakken]] |issue=6| title=Anime Grand Prix 2008–2009| date=May 2009 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards from 2008, Lelouch was nominated as one of the best male characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comipress.com/press-release/2008/03/27/3442|title=Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Announces SPJA Industry Award Finalists at Tokyo International Anime Fair|publisher=Comipress.com|date=March 27, 2008|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://giapet.net/2008/07/06/spja-industry-award-winners-are-up/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802023439/http://giapet.net/2008/07/06/spja-industry-award-winners-are-up/ | archivedate=August 2, 2008 | title=SPJA Industry Award Winners are Up | date=July 6, 2008 | publisher=Giapet | accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- If someone asks about Giapet's reability: http://www.comipress.com/news/2008/07/04/3608 --&gt; In 2014, [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] customers voted him as their 13th favorite black haired male anime character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2014-05-05/japanese-fans-rank-their-favorite-black-haired-anime-characters|title= Japanese Fans Rank Their Favorite Black-Haired Anime Characters|date=May 5, 2014|author=Dong, Bamboo|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His voice actor [[Jun Fukuyama]] also won the "Best Actor in a Leading Role" award for his portrayal of the character at the first [[Seiyu Awards]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Results of Japan's First Ever Seiyuu Awards Announced|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-03-05/results-of-japan's-first-ever-seiyuu-awards-announced|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |date=March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama's work as Lelouch's voice actor also lead him to win the [[Tokyo International Anime Fair]] in the category "Best Voice Actor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ponyo Wins Tokyo Anime Fair's Animation of the Year|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-02-19/ponyo-wins-tokyo-anime-fair-animation-of-the-year|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |date=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics for anime and manga series have also commented on Lelouch's character. [[Anime News Network]]'s Carl Kimlinger stated that Lelouch "is hard to like" because of his narcissistic personality, but noted that his bonds with Nunnally and his friends make up for that.&lt;ref name="annrev"&gt;{{cite web |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD 1–2|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion/dvd-1|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |author=Kimlinger, Carl|date=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamboo Dong from the site agreed with Kimlinger, though noted that Lelouch' made the character interesting to watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shelf Life Cracking the Code|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2008-08-18|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=August 18, 2008 |author=Dong, Bamboo|date=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gia Manry from the same site listed Suzaku and him as the third best "frenemies" in anime due to how their friendship falls apart as a result of their rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shelf Life Cracking the Code|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/gia-list/anime-7-best-frenemies/2011-10-29|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=October 29, 2011 |author=Manry, Gia|date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly positive response were given by Danielle Van Gorder from Mania Entertainment due to Lelouch's differences from most of anime's protagonists and how his double life as a Zero and as a student is shown across the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD 1|url=http://www.mania.com/code-geass-lelouch-rebellion-vol-1_article_80469.html|publisher=Mania Entertainment|accessdate=April 4, 2011 |author=Van Gorder, Danielle|date=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Beveridge from the same site praised Lelouch's actions in ''R2'' when he becomes Britannia's Emperor, describing him as "the classic angle of the villain with good motives" because of the dangerous actions he does for a greater good. Beveridge also commented on his confrontations with Scheizel and Nunnally, mentioning the rivalry across the series in the former and citing the latter as heartbreaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 Part 4 (also w/LE)|url=http://www.mania.com/code-geass-lelouch-rebellion-r2-part-4-also-wle_article_119422.html|publisher=Mania Entertainment|accessdate=April 4, 2011|author=Van Beveridge, Chris|date=April 26, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210095233/http://www.mania.com/code-geass-lelouch-rebellion-r2-part-4-also-wle_article_119422.html|archivedate=December 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] compared him with [[Light Yagami]] from the ''[[Death Note]]'' series, due to his double life and his questionable methods, respectively. The double life aspect has also been praised due to how such change also differentiates the show's tone from a high school comedy to an action show, and how he "winds-up" between his two selves. Moreover, his reasons for evil actions have also been found to help viewers to like the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Part I|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/907/907648p1.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 4, 2011 |author=Smith, D.F.|date=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also from IGN, Ramsey Isler found Lelouch's double life trait as rather comical as after short prologue of his role as Zero in an episode, he is seen doing homework at school for being absent to classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Code Geass: "The School Festival Declaration" Review|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/911/911971p1.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 4, 2011 |author=Isler, Ramsey|date=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Leathers from UK Anime Network enjoyed Lelouch's personality as his cold persona made the series "refreshing" from other mecha anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anime Review: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Box 1|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Code_Geass:_Lelouch_of_the_Rebellion_Box_1.html|publisher=UK Anime Network|accessdate=April 4, 2011 |author=Leathers, Kevin|date=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lelouch is ranked 23rd on IGN's 2009 list of best anime characters of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/21/top-25-anime-characters-of-all-time?page=1|title=Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time|date=October 20, 2009|author=Mackenzie, Chris |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 18th on IGN's 2014 list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/04/top-25-greatest-anime-characters?page=2 | title=Top 25 Greatest Anime Characters | author=Isler, Ramsey | date=February 4, 2014 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahlon Mitchell''' (born February 24, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/MahlonMitchell/info Mahlon Mitchell About.] Mahlon Mitchell Resume. Retrieved March 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] firefighter and current President of the Professional [[Fire fighters|Fire Fighters]] of [[Wisconsin]]. Assuming the office on January 12, 2011, he became the youngest and first [[African American]] president of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pffw.org/index.cfm?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&amp;HomeID=188939|title=Madisonian becomes first Black president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin|last=Dahmer|first=A. David|date=Jan 12, 2011|publisher=Madison Times|language=|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to serving as the President of the PFFW, Mitchell serves as president of the "Sable Flames," the [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]] firefighters of the [[Madison, Wisconsin|City of Madison Fire Department]].  Mitchell unsuccessfully ran in the [[Democratic Party of Wisconsin|Democratic]] primary for [[Governor of Wisconsin]] in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2018|2018]], placing second.

==Early life and career==
Mitchell was born in Milwaukee and grew up in [[Delavan, Wisconsin]]. Mitchell worked as a [[Street Outreach Program|street outreach]] coordinator, linking at-risk youth with community services, and for six years as a [[Real estate agent|real estate agent]] in the Madison area. Prior to his election as President of the Fire Fighter's Association, Mitchell served as a firefighter for more than fifteen years in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mahlonmitchell.com/about-mahlon/ About Mahlon] MahlonMitchell.com Retrieved March 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell has served as a counselor at the Wisconsin Alliance for [[Fire safety|Fire Safety]]'s Burn Camp, which he also directed for five years. This [[Summer camp|summer camp]] worked with burn-injured youth to help them cope with their unique situation and build a network of support. Mitchell was promoted to [[Firefighter#Ranks|lieutenant]] in the Madison Fire Department in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmadison.com/fire/documents/OrgChart.pdf|title=Organizational Chart, Madison Fire Dept.|date=2011-06-20|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell worked to help pass two pieces of legislation that were seen as victories for fire fighters across the state, including the Infectious Disease Presumption Law to ensure that firefighters are covered if they contract a disease or disability on the job, and a law ensuring that families and spouses of fire fighters who die in the line of duty will have their [[Health insurance premium|health insurance premiums]] covered. 

Mitchell was sought out by the national media as a critic of [[Wisconsin]] [[Scott Walker (politician)|Governor Scott Walker]]’s [[2011 Wisconsin protests|collective bargaining changes]], which prompted weeks of demonstrations in Madison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/03/mahlon-mitchell/potential-recall-candidate-says-walker-gave-compan/|title=Potential recall candidate says Walker gave companies two years of no taxes|date=November 3, 2011|publisher=PolitiFact Wisconsin|language=|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In late October 2011, a movement to draft him to run against Walker for the office of [[Governor of Wisconsin]] surfaced on the internet. In response, Mitchell stated he would consider running in a potential recall election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Don|title=Mahlon Mitchell for governor campaign launched|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/132776233.html|accessdate=3 November 2011|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another Possible Candidate Eyes Recall Run For Governor|url=http://www.channel3000.com/news/Another-Possible-Candidate-Eyes-Recall-Run-For-Governor/-/1648/8299822/-/ase1rjz/-/index.html|publisher=Channel 3000 CBS News|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 2012, Mitchell announced his candidacy for the office of [[Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin]] in a recall election against [[Rebecca Kleefisch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mux|first=Lisa|title=Mahlon Mitchell to make announcement on 3/19|url=http://bloggingblue.com/2012/03/17/mahlon-mitchell-to-make-announcement-on-319/|publisher=Blogging Blue|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While victorious in the [[Democratic Party of Wisconsin|Democratic Primary]], Mitchell was defeated in the June 5, 2012 election with 1,156,520 votes to Kleefisch's 1,301,739. In 2013, Mitchell received an honorary degree from the [[National Labor College]] Maritime Institute of Graduate Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Labor College Names Honorary Degree Recipients|url=http://www.nlc.edu/national-labor-college-names-honorary-degree-recipients/|accessdate=29 January 2018|publisher=National Labor College|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martha Corey''' (1619 or 1620 – September 22, 1692) was accused and convicted of [[witchcraft]] during the [[Salem witch trials]], on September 9, 1692, and was hanged on September 22, 1692.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TG8oDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Salem-Village+Witchcraft:+A+Documentary+Record+of+Local+Conflict+in+Colonial+New+England&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvu8So47jeAhWjt1kKHfqOApYQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Salem-Village%20Witchcraft%3A%20A%20Documentary%20Record%20of%20Local%20Conflict%20in%20Colonial%20New%20England&amp;f=false|title=Salem-Village Witchcraft: A Documentary Record of Local Conflict in Colonial New England|last=Boyer|first=Paul|last2=Nissenbaum|first2=Stephen|publisher=Northeastern University Press|year=1993|isbn=1555531644|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her second husband, [[Giles Corey]], was also accused.

In 1677 Martha Corey had an illegitimate, mixed race son named Benoni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/people?group.num=&amp;mbio.num=mb35|title=Salem Witch Trials Notable Persons|website=salem.lib.virginia.edu|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corey married Henry Rich in 1684 and had a second son named Thomas Rich. After the death of her first husband, she married wealthy farmer Giles Corey in the year 1690. Both Giles and Martha had a controversial past that contributed to their death in the Salem Witch Trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historyofmassachusetts.org/martha-corey/|title=Martha Corey: Gospel Woman or Gospel Witch? – History of Massachusetts Blog|website=historyofmassachusetts.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

= &lt;small&gt;Salem Witch Trials&lt;/small&gt; =
The community was surprised to see Corey accused, as she was known for her [[piety]] and dedicated [[church attendance]]. She had never shown support for the witch trials, since she did not believe witches or warlocks existed. She was outspoken in her belief that the accusers were lying, and upon hearing this, two young girls [[Ann Putnam Jr.]] and [[Mercy Lewis]] promptly accused her of [[witchcraft]].

She was unaware of the level of [[paranoia]] in the [[Salem, Massachusetts|village]], and when she went to trial, she was simply truthful about her innocence and never doubted she would be [[exonerated]]. As the girls testified against her during examination, Corey asked the judge not to believe the rantings of [[hysteria|hysterical]] children. The girls began [[mimic]]king her movements as if they were being controlled by her. Mercy Lewis called out, "There's a man he whispered in her ear." [[John Hathorne]] asked Lewis if the man was [[devil|Satan]], then shortly Ann Putnam Jr. cried out that Martha Corey had a yellow bird sucking on her hand, which was enough evidence to persuade the [[jury]] of her guilt. She was [[hanging|hanged]] on September 22, 1692. She was 72 years old.

Her husband, [[Giles Corey|Giles]], defended her against the [[allegations]], and in due time he was also accused of [[witchcraft]] himself. He refused to undergo a [[trial]] and was executed by [[peine forte et dure|pressing]], a slow crushing death under a pile of stones. The main reason usually cited for his refusal to be tried or to say yea or nay was to keep his estate from being confiscated from his heirs. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} When the sheriff asked how he would plead, he responded only by asking for more weight. He died on September 19, 1692, three days before his wife Martha was hanged. Since he had not been convicted, his estate passed, in accordance with his last [[will and testament]],  to those of his children who had maintained that he was innocent.

==In popular culture==
Corey and her husband are both characters in the [[Arthur Miller]] play ''[[The Crucible]]'' (although Martha is only heard off-stage). In the [[The Crucible (1957 film)|1957]] and [[The Crucible (1996 film)|1996]] film adaptations of Miller's play, she was depicted (on-screen) by Jeanne Fusier-Gir and [[Mary Pat Gleason]], respectively.

}}
'''Martin "Marty" Bergen''' (October 25, 1871 – January 19, 1900) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] player from {{mlby|1896}} to {{mlby|1899}}. He played in 344 [[games played|games]] during his four-year career with the [[Boston Beaneaters]], 337 of them as their [[catcher]]. Bergen helped the Beaneaters to two straight [[National League]] pennants ({{mlby|1897}} and {{mlby|1898}}) and a second-place finish in 1899.

A 2001 article about him described him as "a nimble fielder with a bullwhip arm who could snap the ball to second base without so much as moving his feet".&lt;ref name="vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1022658/1/index.htm|work=CNN|title=Video|date=June 4, 2001|accessdate=2010-05-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211163408/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1022658/1/index.htm|archivedate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] outfielder [[Jesse Burkett]] characterized Bergen as the best catcher in baseball history.

Bergen suffered from apparent [[mental illness]]. By 1899, he experienced hallucinations, had to be removed from a game due to odd behavior, and walked off from the team train during a trip to Boston. On January 19, 1900, he killed his wife (the former Hattie Gaines),&lt;ref name="Bergen's Last Day 1900, p. 3"&gt;"Bergen's Last Day." ''Boston Herald'', January 20, 1900, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and two children, then took his own life.&lt;ref&gt;"Catcher Bergen a Suicide." ''Pittsburg(KS) Plain Dealer'', January 27, 1900, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, and the brevity of his career, he received one vote in both 1938 and 1939 to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;Posnanski, Joe.[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/joe_posnanski/02/11/hall.steroids/index.html?eref=T1 Hall of Fame Needs to Get Rid of Ridiculous Character Clause]. [[SI.com]]. February 11, 2009. Retrieved 2013-08-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born in [[North Brookfield, Massachusetts]], Bergen attracted attention while playing for a series of teams from 1892 to 1895. But his behavior was mercurial. Batting .372, Bergen left the [[Kansas City Blues (Western League)|Kansas City Blues]] suddenly in 1895 over a perceived slight, and never again played for the team. Boston had scouted him, and was quick to purchase his contract for $1,000.

Within a year, Bergen had established a reputation for [[Caught stealing|throwing out baserunners]]. Bergen played in 344 major league games for the Beaneaters teams,&lt;ref name="retrosheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B/Pbergm102.htm|title=Marty Bergen's career statistics|publisher=retrosheet.org|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who won two straight [[National League]] pennants (1897–1898), and finished in second place in 1899.&lt;ref name="retrosbraves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/A/FR_ATL.htm|title=Atlanta Braves (1871–2007)|publisher=retrosheet.org|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a catcher, he had mixed results, as exemplified by the 1898 season. On the plus side, he had a [[Range factor]] of 5.17 in 1898—well above the league average of 4.60 for catchers. However, Bergen also led the league's catchers with 24 errors and 38 [[passed ball]]s. He had a career [[batting average]] of .258 with 69 [[extra base hit]]s and 176 RBIs.&lt;ref name=retrosheet/&gt;

Future Hall of Famer [[Jesse Burkett]] enthusiastically described Bergen's skills in 1900: "As a catcher, Martin Bergen was the best the world ever produced. No man acted with more natural grace as a ballplayer. There was finish in every move he made. His eye was always true, and his movements so quick and accurate in throwing that the speediest base runners ... never took chances when Bergen was behind the bat."&lt;ref name="vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com"/&gt;

==Mental illness==
Bergen's teammates appreciated his strong arm and hustling style of play, but relations between the catcher and the team soured following an altercation with [[Vic Willis]] in which Bergen inexplicably slapped him while eating breakfast. The team's mixed emotions were expressed by an anonymous Boston player quoted in the press: "He has made trouble with a good many of the boys and we just give him a wide berth. But he's a ballplayer, and once we get into a game, personal feelings are set aside in admiration of the artist, for such he is."

Bergen's condition worsened in 1899, which led to internal turmoil for the Beaneaters. He was having hallucinations that enemies were trying to poison him. His son died in April, and Bergen imagined that his teammates were making jokes behind his back about the death. He began sitting in particular positions, and walking sideways, so that he could spot assassins approaching from either side of him. Boston's team president urged the other players to avoid Bergen, fearing what he might do. Some blamed his condition on heavy drink,&lt;ref name="cooperstown"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Alvin L.|author2=Peter M. Rutkoff|title=The Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture|publisher=McFarland|year=2000|pages=180|isbn=0-7864-0832-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=189vXwlGxpgC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=%22Marty+Bergen%22+baseball&amp;source=web&amp;ots=w-_puNKJMO&amp;sig=d9np5_fiy7NlzfR-tgiYRdoXdCA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA180,M1|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Bergen was regarded by others as a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]].

In mid-July 1899, Bergen silently walked off the team's train at the beginning of a road trip, leaving Boston with just a backup catcher during a heated pennant race. However, he was lustily cheered by fans upon his return to the team. In September, Bergen disappeared again for a few days, then showed up unannounced a few minutes before a game and put on his catching gear without speaking to anyone. On October 9, Bergen had to be removed from a game when he dodged the pitches rather than catching them, because he was preoccupied with avoiding knife thrusts from an invisible assailant. Bergen was aware of his mental state, and actively sought help from both [[clergy]] and physicians. However, he refused to take any of the [[bromide]]s prescribed by his doctor, explaining, "I thought someone in the National League had found out that you were my family physician and had arranged to give me some poison. I did not take it from my wife because I didn't wish hers to be the hand that poisoned me."

One book on Boston baseball history recounts that after his son's death, Bergen "would catch a few games, then ask manager [[Frank Selee]] if he could return home for a few days."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Boston Braves, 1871-1953|author=Kaese, H.|date=1948|publisher=Northeastern University Press|isbn=9781555536176|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SLF_umn--N4C&amp;pg=PA97|page=97|accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Selee refused permission, Bergen would go home anyway. Bergen complained that players kept reminding him of his son who had died, and he resented a $300 fine imposed for being AWOL. "Black moods came on Bergen who seemed to be happy only when on his farm in North Brookfield." Several players said they would not return to the Beaneaters in 1900 if the increasingly erratic Bergen was still with the club.&lt;ref name="braves1871"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaense|first=Harold|author2=Warren Spahn |author3=Richard A. Johnson |title=The Boston Braves, 1871-1953 |publisher=Northeastern University Press|year=2004|pages=97|isbn=1-55553-617-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also reports that Bergen had suffered a career-ending broken hip during a game in the 1899 season.&lt;ref name="librarychrono"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Marty_Bergen_1871&amp;page=chronology|title=Marty Bergen from the Chronology|publisher=baseballlibrary.com|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="offenders"&gt;{{cite book|last=Connor|first=Floyd|title=Baseball's Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of the National Pastime's Outrageous Offenders, Lucky Bounces, and Other Oddities|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2006|pages=360|isbn=1-57866-157-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=-CBQRtOgxacC&amp;dq=Baseball's+Most+Wanted:+The+Top+10+Book+of+the+National+Pastime's+Outrageous+Offenders&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IzoBhujWra&amp;sig=H58Jsx_UCbOu7aczQK_V33MLN1c&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA360,M1|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In January 1900, at his home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, the 28-year-old Bergen ended his life in [[murder-suicide]]. Neighbors expressed shock and said they saw no warning signs. Several had seen him before the tragedy unfolded, and recalled him as "unusually cheerful" and "pleasant" when conversing with them. The neighbors also told reporters how devoted he always seemed to his wife.&lt;ref name="Bergen's Last Day 1900, p. 3"/&gt; The medical examiner reported that Bergen killed his wife and two children with an [[axe]], then used a [[straight razor]] to cut his own throat with such force that he nearly beheaded himself. Bergen's father discovered the bodies. According to an article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporting on the tragedy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The little boy (Bergen's 3-year-old son) was lying on the floor with a large wound in the head. Mrs. Bergen's skull was terribly crushed, having evidently been struck more than one blow by the infuriated husband. The appearance of the little girl (his 6-year-old daughter found on the kitchen floor next to Bergen) also showed that a number of savage blows had been rained upon the top and side of her head. Bergen's throat had been cut with a razor, and the head was nearly severed.&lt;ref name="bergenobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kills His Entire Family: Martin Bergen, Boston's Catcher, a Murderer and Suicide|date=January 20, 1900|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2011-11-15|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/01/20/102577193.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bergen's behavior had been known to the [[news media|press]], which suppressed much of it. Following his death, they reported that he had been subject to "fits of melancholy" and had "showed signs of insanity" in the fall of 1899.&lt;ref name=bergenobit/&gt; After examining contemporary accounts, the [[Harvard Medical School]]'s Dr. Carl Salzman felt that Bergen was likely a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] with possible [[manic depression]].

In 1934, [[Connie Mack]] and [[George M. Cohan]], both of whom had ties to North Brookfield, helped raise funds to erect a granite memorial to Bergen. The inscription on the monument at Bergen's gravesite at St. Joseph's Cemetery on Bell Street read: "In memory of Martin Bergen, 1871–1900. Member of the Boston National League Club. Erected in appreciation of his contribution to American's national game."&lt;ref name=braves1871/&gt;

Marty Bergen's brother, [[Bill Bergen]], was a major league catcher as well, playing for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and the [[Brooklyn Superbas]] from {{mlby|1901}} to {{mlby|1911}}.&lt;ref name="retrobill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B/Pbergb102.htm|title=Bill Bergen's career statistics|publisher=retrosheet.org|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory Retirement Age for Teachers==
On November 28, 2008, MP [[Abdullah Al-Roumi]] joined MPs [[Khaled AlـSultan Bin Essa]], [[Hassan Johar]], [[Musallam Al-Barrak]], and Al-Azmi in formulating a bill to extend the mandatory retirement age for Kuwaiti teaching staff at Kuwait University from 65 to 70 years.  They argued that Item 32 of Law no. 15/1979 has denied the country services of able and intelligent academicians by restricting retirement age of Kuwaitis to 65 years. They recommended that a clause be added to the law such that the retirement age can become 70 years and can further be extended to 75 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.com/news/newsfull.php?newid=190555]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nilda Elvira Vattuone''' (10 September 1911 – 20 December 2013), better known by her stage name '''Nelly Omar''', was an Argentine actress and singer during the [[Cinema of Argentina#1930s–1950s: The Golden Age|Golden Age of Argentine Cinema]]. She was successful as a tango singer, performing on numerous radio shows and performed ''canción criolla''. Her film career began in 1940. She was blacklisted after the ouster of [[Juan Perón]] for having sung his anthem, ''Soy La Descamisada'' and did not work again until the 1970s. From her comeback in 1972, she remained an active performer until her death.

==Biography==
Nilda Elvira Vattuone Pesoa was born in Bonifacio a small town in the [[Guaminí Partido|Guaminí subdivision of, Buenos Aires]] on 10 September 1911 to Marcos Vattuone and Salustiana Pesoa.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pérez|first1=Jorge|title=Se fue un mito, nació una leyenda|url=http://www.diarioeltiempo.com.ar/se-fue-un-mito-nacio-una-leyenda.html|accessdate=21 May 2015|publisher=Diario El Tiempo|date=23 December 2013|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622174017/http://www.diarioeltiempo.com.ar/se-fue-un-mito-nacio-una-leyenda.html|archivedate=22 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died while she was quite young and the family moved to Buenos Aires, for better work prospects. Nelly began working in a textile factory at age 12.&lt;ref name="english obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Legendary tango singer Nelly Omar dies, 102|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/148011/legendary-tango-singer-nelly-omar-dies-102|accessdate=22 May 2015|agency=Télam|publisher=Buenos Aires Herald|date=21 December 2013|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the age of 13, she dreamed of becoming a pilot and went to flight school. It was there that she met [[Eva Perón|Eva Duarte]], who also had aspirations of becoming an aviator.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;

In 1924, Omar began singing tango professionally. [[Ignacio Corsini]] gave her her big break into singing when he heard her and hired her for his radio shows. She sang with the ensemble ''Cenizas del fogón'' under the direction of [[José Luis Suilas]]. Between 1932  and 1933, [[Radio Stentor]] broadcast duets of Omar and her sister. When she was hired by [[Radio Belgrano]] she worked with some of the most famous tango poets, [[Enrique Cadícamo]] and [[Homero Manzi]], as well as some of the most famous singers then working, [[Libertad Lamarque]] and [[Agustín Magaldi]].  Homero Manzi wrote at least three tangos for Omar: ''Solamente ella'', ''Ninguna'' and ''[[Sur (tango)|Sur]]''. She had a clear voice with firm phrasing and reached the height of her fame in the 1940s and 1950s. Trademark tangos, which remain associated with her are ''Amar y callar'', ''Del tiempo de la morocha'', ''Manoblanca'', ''Nobleza de arrabal'' and ''Tu vuelta Sur''. She also performed in the [[Criolla|canción criolla]] genre, which had been all but forgotten.&lt;ref name="english obit" /&gt;

In 1946, Omar recorded her first album, accompanied by [[Francisco Canaro]]’s orchestra, on the Odeón label. In 1951 she was signed by RCA Victor, and recorded a 78 rpm album with [[Domingo Farafiotti]]’s orchestra. In 1955, she traveled to [[Montevideo, Uruguay]] and appeared in a stage production and then moved to [[Venezuela]] for a year, before returning to Argentina. She retired from singing upon her return until her comeback in 1972.&lt;ref name="english obit" /&gt;

In 1945, Omar sang an anthem, a milonga, ''Soy La Descamisada'',&lt;ref name="27 July 1972"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nelly Omar Returns to the Stage|url=https://todayintango.wordpress.com/2011/07/27/1972-july-27-nelly-omar-returns-to-the-stage/|accessdate=22 May 2015|publisher=Today in Tango|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was created for the political campaign of [[Juan Perón]]. She wholeheartedly supported Perón and when he was ousted in 1955, she was blacklisted from the entertainment industry for 17 years. She made only three films prior to 1955, including ''[[Canto de amor]]'' (1940), directed by [[Julio Irigoyen]], which also starred the singer [[Carlos Viván]]. It is believed that all copies of the film were destroyed;&lt;ref name=biography /&gt; however, the Argentine film archives has photographs taken during filming.&lt;ref name="Canto de amor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canto de amor|url=http://www.acceder.gov.ar/fr/580668|website=acceder|publisher=Ministére de la Culture|accessdate=22 May 2015|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish|date=1940}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, she filmed ''Melodías de América'' with [[Eduardo Morera]].&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt; Though she is not listed in the cast roster,&lt;ref name="Melodías de América"&gt;{{cite web|title=Melodías de América|url=http://www.acceder.gov.ar/fr/1677088|website=acceder|publisher=Ministére de a Culture|accessdate=22 May 2015|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; she is documented in a cast photo of the film.&lt;ref name="Melodías de América2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Melodías de América|url=http://www.acceder.gov.ar/fr/1677094|website=acceder|publisher=Ministére de a Culture|accessdate=22 May 2015|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, she dubbed the singing voice of [[Mecha Ortiz]] in the film ''Mi vida por la tuya''. She would not make another film for 57 years, but in 2008, she worked on a documentary about tango entitled ''Café de los maestros'' under the direction of [[Miguel Kohan]].&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;

In 1972, she staged a singing comeback accompanied by guitarist [[José Canet]],&lt;ref name="english obit" /&gt; who convinced her to come out of retirement. They did a series of concerts&lt;ref name="27 July 1972" /&gt; and she began releasing records, appearing regularly on stage,&lt;ref name=biography /&gt; and she also wrote two books.

She died of cardiac arrest on 20 December 2013, aged 102, at the Hospital Universitario CEMIC in her native Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Nelly Omar dies at 102|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/147948/nelly-omar-dies-at-102%20Nelly%20Omar%20dies%20at%20age%20102|accessdate=21 May 2015|publisher=Buenos Aires Herald|date=20 December 2013|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenwick has been part of the editorial board for a number of journals, including the ''[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]]'', the ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'' and the ''Journal of Epilepsy and Behaviour''.&lt;ref name="Sleepcentre"/&gt;

==Near-death research==
Fenwick's interest in near-death experiences was piqued when he read [[Raymond Moody]]'s book ''[[Life After Life (book)|Life After Life]]''. Initially skeptical of Moody's anecdotal evidence, Fenwick reassessed his opinion after a discussion with one of his own patients, who described a [[near-death experience]] very similar to that of Moody's subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwater|first=P.M.H.|title=The Big Book of Near-Death Experiences|publisher=Hampton Roads Publishing|year=2007|ISBN=978-1-57174-547-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, he has collected and analysed more than 300 examples of near-death experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/bios/peter-fenwick.asp|title=Peter Fenwick: Biography &amp; Resources|work=Enlightenment Magazine|accessdate=April 23, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802045120/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/bios/peter-fenwick.asp|archivedate=2 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been criticised by the medical community for claiming that human consciousness can survive bodily death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/life-goes-on-but-even-after-death-72090.html|work=Irish Independent|title=Life goes on... but even after death?|accessdate=18 April 2012|first=Jane|last=Wheatley|date=6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenwick argues that human consciousness may be more than just a function of the brain.&lt;ref name="RCP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/SIG%20Website%20April%203rd%2009%20Programme.pdf|title=Consciousness and the Extended Mind: Programme notes|author=Royal College of Psychiatrists: Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8264-9923-3 "The Art of Dying: A Journey to Elsewhere"].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The plain fact is that none of us understands these phenomena. As for the soul and life after death, they are still open questions, though I myself suspect that NDEs are part of the same continuum as mystical experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moriah.com.au/textarchive/nde.htm|title=Near Death Experiences|author=Peter Roennfeldt|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fenwick and his wife are co-authors of ''The Art of Dying'', a study of the spiritual needs of near-death patients. The Fenwicks argue that modern medical practices have devalued end-of-life experiences, and call for a more holistic approach to death and dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3355257/How-to-give-death-a-good-name.html|work=The Telegraph|title=How to give death a good name|accessdate=18 April 2012|location=London|first=Elizabeth|last=Grice|date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Fenwick and [[Sam Parnia]] appeared in the [[BBC]] [[documentary]] "The Day I Died". In the documentary Parnia and Fenwick discussed their belief that research from near-death experiences indicates the mind is independent of the brain. According to [[Susan Blackmore]] the documentary misled viewers with beliefs that are rejected by the majority of scientists. Blackmore criticized the documentary for biased and "dishonest reporting",&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Blackmore]]. (2004).

Retrieved 2014-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in respect to the theory of consciousness proposed by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, which Blackmore herself presented as a theory long ago subjected to "the most devastating critique" by philosophers Rick Grush and Patricia Churchland, who, according to Blackmore, took Penrose &amp; Hameroff's "argument step by step, and demolish(ed) each one".&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Blackmore failed to mention the existence of a reply by Penrose and Hameroff, in which Grush and Churchland’s arguments are demonstrated to be misleading and with respect to the physiological evidence factually incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penrose, R.; Hameroff, S.|first=|date=1995|title=What ‘Gaps’?

Fenwick and Parnia have claimed that research from NDEs may show the "mind is still there after the brain is dead". The neurologist Michael O'Brien has written "most people would not find it necessary to postulate such a separation between mind and brain to explain the events," and suggested that further research is likely to provide a physical explanation for near-death experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Brien.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15139">'''Religious skepticism''' is a type of [[skepticism]] relating to [[religion]]. Religious skeptics question religious authority and are not necessarily [[Antireligion|anti-religious]] but skeptical of specific or all religious beliefs and/or practices. [[Socrates]] was one of the most prominent and first religious skeptics of whom there are records; he questioned the legitimacy of the beliefs of his time in the existence of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek gods]]. Religious skepticism is not the same as [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]] and some religious skeptics are [[Deism|deists]].

== Overview ==

The word [[skeptic]] (sometimes [[sceptic]]) is derived from the middle [[French language|French]] ''sceptique'' or the [[Latin-language|Latin]] ''scepticus'', literally "sect of the sceptics". Its origin is in the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''skeptikos'', meaning inquiring, reflective or one that doubts.{{R|"defined"}} As such, religious skepticism generally refers to doubting or questioning something about religion. Although, as noted by [[J. L. Schellenberg|Schellenberg]] the term is sometimes more generally applied to anyone that has a negative view of religion.{{R|"schellenberg2"}}

The earliest beginnings of religious skepticism can be traced back to [[Xenophanes]]. He critiqued popular religion of his time, particularly false conceptions of the divine that are a byproduct of the human propensity to [[anthropomorphize]] deities. He took the scripture of his time to task for painting the gods in a negative light and promoted a more rational view of religion. He was very critical of religious people privileging their belief system over others without sound reason{{R|"xenophanes"}}{{R|"vogt"}}

The majority of skeptics are agnostics and atheists but there are also a number of religious people that are skeptical of religion.{{R|"sturgess"}} The religious are generally skeptical about claims of other religions, at least when the two denominations conflict concerning some stated belief. Some philosophers put forth the sheer diversity of religion as a justification for skepticism by theists and non-theists alike.{{R|"schellenberg3"}} Theists are also generally skeptical of the claims put forth by atheists.{{R|"mann"}}

[[Michael Shermer]] wrote that religious skepticism is a process for discovering the truth rather than general non-acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} For this reason a religious skeptic might believe that [[Jesus]] existed while questioning claims that he was the messiah or performed miracles (see [[historicity of Jesus]]). [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s ''[[The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth]]'', a literal cut and paste of the [[New Testament]] that removes anything [[supernatural]], is a prominent example.

=== Modern religious skepticism ===

The term has morphed into one that typically emphasizes scientific and historical methods of evidence. There are some skeptics that question whether religion is a viable topic for criticism given that it doesn't require proof for belief. Others, however, insist it is as much as any other knowledge. Especially when it makes claims that contradict those made by science.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"kurtz"}}

There has been much work since the late 20th century by philosophers such as Schellenburg and [[Paul Moser|Moser]] and both have written numerous books pertaining to the topic.{{R|"schellenbergbooks"}}{{R|"moserbooks"}} Much of their work has focused on defining what religion is and specifically what people are skeptical of about it.{{R|"moser2007"}}{{R|"schellenberg2"}} The work of others have argued for the viability of religious skepticism by appeal to higher-order evidence (evidence about our evidence and our capacities for evaluation),{{R|"king"}} what some call meta-evidence.{{R|"wykstra"}}

There are still echos of early Greek skepticism in the way some current thinkers question the intellectual viability of belief in the divine.{{R|"penner"}}

In modern times there is a certain amount of mistrust and lack of acceptance of religious skeptics, particularly towards those that are also atheists.{{R|"hughes"}}{{R|"zuckerman"}}{{R|"edgell"}} This is coupled with concerns many skeptics have about the government in countries, such as the [[U.S.A.]], where [[separation of church and state]] are central tenants.{{R|"coskun"}}

== Selected historical occurrences ==

[[Socrates]] was raised in polytheistic society in which the gods were not omnipotent and required sacrifice and ritual. Socrates' conception of the divine was that they always benevolent, truthful, authoritative, and wise. Divinity was to operate within the standards of rationality.{{R|"socrates"}} This critique ultimately resulted in his [[Trial of Socrates|trial for impiety and corruption]] as documented in [[Apology (Plato)|The Apology]].

In ancient India, there was a materialist philosophical school called the [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]], who were known as being skeptical of the religious claims of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], its rituals and texts.

The historian [[Will Durant]] writes that [[Plato]] was "as skeptical of atheism as of any other dogma."{{R|"durant"}}{{R|"vogt"}}

[[Democritus]] was the father of [[Materialism]] and there is no trace of a belief in afterlife in his work. Specifically in ''Those in Hades'' he refers to constituents of the soul as atoms that dissolve upon death.{{R|"Ferwerda"}}

In [[De Natura Deorum]] the Roman statesman [[Cicero]] calls into question the character of the gods, whether or not they participate in earthly affairs, and questions their existence. This a significant evolution from his earlier writings wherein he was more accommodating to religion{{R|"verhine"}}

In the poem [[De rerum natura]] [[Lucretius]] introduces [[epicurean]] philosophy to the Romans and proclaims that the universe operates according to physical principles and guided by ''fortuna'', or chance, instead of the [[Roman gods]].{{R|"lucretius"}}

[[Thomas Hobbes]] took positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings. He argued repeatedly that there are no [[incorporeal]] substances, and that all things, even [[God]], [[heaven]], and [[hell]] are [[Matter|corporeal]], matter in motion. He argued that "though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity".{{R|"lawler"}}

[[Voltaire]], although himself a deist, was a forceful critic of religion and advocated for acceptance of all religions as well as separation of church and state.{{R|"Pomeau"}}

'''[[Sayyid]] Ruhollah [[Al-Musawi|Mūsavi]] Khomeini''' ({{lang-fa|سید روح‌الله موسوی خمینی}} {{IPA-fa|ruːhoɫˈɫɑːhe χomeiˈniː||Fa-ir-khomeini_(1).ogg}}; 24 September 1902 – 3&amp;nbsp;June 1989), known in the [[Western world]] as '''[[Ayatollah]] Khomeini''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayatollah Khomeini (1900–1989)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/khomeini_ayatollah.shtml|publisher=BBC – History|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Iranian politician and ''[[Marja'|marja]]''. He was the founder of the [[Islamic republic of Iran]] and the leader of the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] that saw the overthrow of the last [[Shah]] of Iran, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], and the end of [[Persian Empire|2,500 years of Persian monarchy]]. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]], a position created in the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death. He was succeeded by [[Ali Khamenei]] on 4 June 1989.

Khomeini was born in 1902 in [[Khomeyn]], in what is now Iran's [[Markazi Province]]. His father was murdered in 1903 when Khomeini was six months old. He began studying the [[Quran]] and the [[Persian language]] from a young age and was assisted in his religious studies by his relatives, including his mother's cousin and older brother.

Khomeini was a ''[[Marja'|marja]]'' ("source of emulation") in [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Islam, a [[Mujtahid]] or ''[[faqih]]'' (an expert in [[Sharia]]) and author of more than 40 books, but he is primarily known for his political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last Shah. In his writings and preachings he expanded the theory of ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|welayat-el faqih]]'', the "Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (clerical authority)", to include [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|political rule by Islamic jurists]].

===Background===
[[File:Ruhollah Khomeini birthplace 5.jpg|thumb|Ruhollah Khomeini's birthplace at [[Khomeyn]]]]
Ruhollah Khomeini's ancestors migrated towards the end of the 18th century from their original home in [[Nishapur]], [[Khorasan Province]], in northeastern part of Iran, for a short stay, to the kingdom of [[Awadh]] – a region in the modern state of [[Uttar Pradesh, India]] – whose  [[Padshah-i-Oudh|rulers]] were [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] Muslims of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Algar|first1=Hamid|authorlink1=Hamid Algar|editor1-last=Koya|editor1-first=Abdar Rahman|title=Imam Khomeini: Life, Thought and Legacy|date=2010|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|isbn=978-9675062254|page=19|chapter=A short biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntarP5hrza0C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=awadh+persian&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=awadh%20persian&amp;f=false Sacred space and holy war: the politics, culture and history of Shi'ite Islam] by Juan Ricardo Cole&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranchamber.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/rkhomeini/ayatollah_khomeini.php |title=Historic Personalities of Iran: Ayatollah Khomeini |publisher=Iranchamber.com |date= |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7BaVwfpWZgUC&amp;pg=RA2-PA17&amp;dq=awadh+origin&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=awadh%20origin&amp;f=false Art and culture: endeavours in interpretation] by Ahsan Jan Qaisar, Som Prakash Verma, Mohammad Habib&lt;/ref&gt; During their rule they extensively invited, and received, a steady stream of Persian scholars, poets, jurists, architects, and painters.&lt;ref name="Avadh"&gt;''Encyclopædia Iranica'',, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avadh-english-also-audh-or-oudh-an-ancient-cultural-and-administrative-region-lying-between-the-himalayas-and-the-ganges-i "Avadh"], E.

===Childhood===
Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, whose first name means "spirit of Allah", was born on 24 September 1902 in [[Khomeyn]], [[Markazi Province]]. He was raised by his mother, Hajieh Agha Khanum, and his aunt, Sahebeth, following the murder of his father, Seyyed Mostafa Hendi, five months after his birth in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/ayatollah-ruhollah-khomeini-13680544 |title=Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini Biography – Facts, Birthday, Life Story |publisher=Biography.com |date= |accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruhollah began to study the [[Qur'an]] and elementary Persian at the age of six.&lt;ref name="rei311"&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1990|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he began to attend a local school, where he learned religion, ''noheh khani'' (lamentation recital), and other traditional subjects.&lt;ref name="moin18" /&gt; Throughout his childhood, he continued his religious education with the assistance of his relatives, including his mother's cousin, Ja'far,&lt;ref name="moin18" /&gt; and his elder brother, Morteza Pasandideh.&lt;ref name="mil85"&gt;{{harvnb|Milani|1994|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and lecturing===
[[File:خمینی و همدرسان.JPG|thumb|left|Khomeini as a student with his friends (second from right)]]
After [[World War I]] arrangements were made for him to study at the Islamic seminary in [[Esfahan]], but he was attracted instead to the seminary in [[Arak, Iran|Arak]]. He was placed under the leadership of [[Ayatollah]] [[Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moin|2000|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Khomeini moved to Arak and commenced his studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brumberg|2001|p=45}}. "By 1920, the year Khomeini moved to Arak..."&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Ayatollah Haeri Yazdi transferred to the Islamic seminary in the holy city of [[Qom]], southwest of [[Tehran]], and invited his students to follow. Khomeini accepted the invitation, moved,&lt;ref name="mil85" /&gt; and took up residence at the Dar al-Shafa school in Qom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moin|2000|p=28}}. "Khomeini's madraseh in Qom was known as the Dar al-Shafa..."&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini's studies included Islamic law (''[[sharia]]'') and jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]''),&lt;ref name="rei311" /&gt; but by that time, Khomeini had also acquired an interest in poetry and philosophy (''[[irfan]]''). So, upon arriving in Qom, Khomeini sought the guidance of [[Mirza]] Ali Akbar Yazdi, a scholar of philosophy and mysticism. Yazdi died in 1924, but Khomeini continued to pursue his interest in philosophy with two other teachers, Javad Aqa Maleki Tabrizi and Rafi'i Qazvini.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moin|2000|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bru46"&gt;{{harvnb|Brumberg|2001|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps Khomeini's biggest influences were another teacher, Mirza Muhammad 'Ali Shahabadi,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rāhnamā|1994|pp=70–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of historic [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[mysticism|mystics]], including [[Mulla Sadra]] and [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name="bru46" /&gt;

Khomeini studied [[Greek Philosophy|Greek philosophy]] and was influenced by both the philosophy of [[Aristotle]], whom he regarded as the founder of logic,&lt;ref name="imamreza"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?print=4250 |title=Philosophy as Viewed by Ruhollah Khomeini |publisher=Imamreza.net |accessdate=19 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614032732/http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?print=4250 |archivedate=14 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plato]], whose views "in the field of divinity" he regarded as "grave and solid".&lt;ref&gt;Kashful-Asrar, p. 33 by Ruhollah Khomeini (&lt;/ref&gt; Among Islamic philosophers, Khomeini was mainly influenced by [[Avicenna]] and [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref name="imamreza"/&gt;

[[File:Ayatollah Khomeini young.jpg|thumb|lift|upright|Khomeini in 1938]]
Apart from philosophy, Khomeini was interested in literature and poetry. His poetry collection was released after his death. Beginning in his adolescent years, Khomeini composed mystic, political and social poetry. His poetry works were published in three collections: ''The Confidant,'' ''The Decanter of Love and Turning Point'', and ''Divan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irib.ir/Ouriran/imam/writing/html/en/page9.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015112221/http://www.irib.ir/Ouriran/imam/writing/html/en/page9.htm |date=15 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His knowledge of poetry is further attested by the modern poet [[Nader Naderpour]] (1929–2000), who "had spent many hours exchanging poems with Khomeini in the early 1960". Naderpour remembered: "For four hours we recited poetry. Every single line I recited from any poet, he recited the next."&lt;ref&gt;Farhang Rajaee, ''Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran'', University of Texas Press (2010), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruhollah Khomeini was a lecturer at [[Najaf]] and Qom seminaries for decades before he was known on the political scene. He soon became a leading scholar of Shia Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/khomeini_ayatollah.shtml |title=BBC – History – Ayatollah Khomeini (1900–1989) |publisher=BBC |date=4 June 1989 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught political philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irib.ir/Occasions/hejrate%20imam-Kuwait/imam.en.HTM ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327052418/http://www.irib.ir/Occasions/hejrate%20imam-Kuwait/imam.en.HTM |date=27 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic history and ethics. Several of his students – for example, [[Morteza Motahari|Morteza Motahhari]] – later became leading Islamic philosophers and also ''[[marja']]''. As a scholar and teacher, Khomeini produced numerous writings on Islamic philosophy, law, and ethics.&lt;ref name="Britannica01"&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045329/Ruhollah-Khomeini |title=Ruhollah Khomeini – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed an exceptional interest in subjects like philosophy and [[mysticism]] that not only were usually absent from the curriculum of seminaries but were often an object of hostility and suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irib.ir/Occasions/imam%20khomeini/ImamKhomeini-en.HTM ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015112215/http://www.irib.ir/Occasions/imam%20khomeini/ImamKhomeini-en.HTM |date=15 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inaugurating his teaching career at the age of 27 by giving private lessons on [[irfan]] and [[Mulla Sadra]] to a private circle, around the same time, in 1928, he also released his first publication, ''Sharh Du'a al-Sahar'' (Commentary on the [[Du'a al-Baha]]), "a detailed commentary, in [[Arabic]], on the prayer recited before dawn during Ramadan by Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]", followed, some years later, by ''Sirr al-Salat'' (Secret of the Prayer), where "the symbolic dimensions and inner meaning of every part of the prayer, from the ablution that precedes it to the salam that concludes it, are expounded in a rich, complex, and eloquent language that owes much to the concepts and terminology of [[Ibn 'Arabi]]. As Sayyid Fihri, the editor and translator of ''Sirr al-Salat'', has remarked, the work is addressed only to the foremost among the spiritual elite (akhass-i khavass) and establishes its author as one of their number."&lt;ref&gt;Ervand Abrahamian, ''Islam, Politics, and Social Movements'', University of California Press (1988), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; The second book has been translated by Sayyid Amjad Hussain Shah Naqavi and released by [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]] in 2015, under the title "[http://www.brill.com/products/book/mystery-prayer-0 The Mystery of Prayer: The Ascension of the Wayfarers and the Prayer of the Gnostics]".

===Political aspects===
His seminary teaching often focused on the importance of religion to practical social and political issues of the day, and he worked against secularism in the 1940s. His first political book, ''Kashf al-Asrar'' (Uncovering of Secrets)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_works.html#answer_kashf_al-asrar |title=Kashf al-Asrar |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah'' (2001), p.60)&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1942, was a point-by-point refutation of ''Asrar-e hazar salih'' (Secrets of a Thousand Years), a tract written by a disciple of Iran's leading [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] historian, [[Ahmad Kasravi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/ruhollah-musavi-khomeini-ayatollah/ |title=Encyclopedia of World Biography on Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, Ayatullah |publisher=Bookrags.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a condemnation of innovations such as international time zones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khomeini |first=Ruhollah |title=Islam and Revolution : Writing and Declarations of Imam Khomeini |others=Translated and Annotated by Hamid Algar, |publisher=Mizan Press |location=Berkeley |date=1981 |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref group="note" name="time-zone"&gt;Prior to the International [[Time Zone]] system, every locality had its own time with 12 noon set to match the moment in that city when the sun was at its highest point in the sky. This was natural for an era when travel was relatively slow and infrequent, but would have played havoc with railway timetables and general modern long-distance communications. In the decades after 1880 governments around the world replaced local time with 24 international time zones, each covering 15 degrees of the earth's longitude (with some exceptions for political boundaries).&lt;/ref&gt;   and the banning of hijab by [[Reza Shah]]. In addition, he went from Qom to Tehran to listen to Ayatullah Hasan Mudarris, the leader of the opposition majority in [[Majlis of Iran|Iran's parliament]] during the 1920s. Khomeini became a ''marja''' in 1963, following the death of Grand Ayatollah [[Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi|Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi]].

==Early political activity==

===Background===
[[File:Ruhollah Khomeini speaking to his followers against capitulation day 1964.jpg|thumb|Khomeini's speech against the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] in [[Qom]], 1964]]

Most Iranians had a deep respect for the Shi'a clergy or [[Ulama]],&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M.J., ''Iran, From Religious Dispute to Revolution'', &lt;br /&gt;Michael M.J. Fischer, Harvard University Press, 1980 p.31&lt;/ref&gt; and tended to be religious, traditional, and alienated from the process of [[Westernization]] pursued by the Shah. In the late 19th century the clergy had shown themselves to be a powerful political force in Iran initiating the [[Tobacco Protest]] against a concession to a foreign (British) interest.

At the age of 61, Khomeini found the arena of leadership open following the deaths of Ayatollah Sayyed Husayn Borujerdi (1961), the leading, although quiescent, Shi'ah religious leader; and [[Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani]] (1962), an activist cleric. The clerical class had been on the defensive ever since the 1920s when the secular, anti-clerical modernizer [[Rezā Shāh|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] rose to power. Reza's son [[Mohammad Reza Shah]], instituted a "[[White Revolution]]", which was a further challenge to the Ulama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/ruhollah-musavi-khomeini-ayatollah/ |title=Encyclopedia of World Biography on Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, Ayatollah |publisher=Bookrags.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to the White Revolution===
In January 1963, the Shah announced the "[[White Revolution]]", a six-point programme of reform calling for [[land reform]], [[nationalization]] of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to [[enfranchise]] women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, [[profit-sharing]] in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a [[Ulema|ulama]] (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists (Khomeini viewed them as "an attack on Islam").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmhschool.org/tthornton/mehistorydatabase/arabisraeliwars.htm#white%20revolution ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224172550/http://www.nmhschool.org/tthornton/mehistorydatabase/arabisraeliwars.htm#white%20revolution |date=24 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the [[Ulema|ulama]] as a class.

Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian [[Shia]] religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the [[Nowruz]] celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies.
[[File:June 3, 1963 speech by Ruhollah Khomeini- Feyziyeh School, Qom (5).jpg|thumb|Khomeini denouncing the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] on [['Ashura]] (3 June 1963)]]

On the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh [[madrasah]] drawing parallels between the Sunni Muslim caliph [[Yazid I|Yazid]], who is perceived as a 'tyrant' by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a "wretched, miserable man," and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/rkhomeini/ayatollah_khomeini.php |title= Moin, Khomeini |year= 2000 |page= 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 1963 (15 of [[Khordad]]) at 3:00&amp;nbsp;am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran.&lt;ref name=vzad90&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vakili Zad|first=Cyrus|title=Organization, Leadership and Revolution: Religiously-Oriented Opposition in the Iranian Revolution of 1978–1979|journal=Conflict Quarterly|date=Spring 1990|pages=5–25|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/viewFile/14889/15958|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this action, there were three days of major riots throughout Iran and the deaths of some 400 people. That event is now referred to as the [[Movement of 15 Khordad]].&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini was kept under house arrest and released in August.&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Iran" by [[Michael Axworthy]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

===Opposition to capitulation===
[[File:خمینی در نماز.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Khomeini in [[prayer]]]]

On 26 October 1964, Khomeini denounced both the Shah and the United States. This time it was in response to the "capitulations" or diplomatic immunity granted by the Shah to American military personnel in Iran.&lt;ref name = "Khomeini"&gt;[http://www.irib.ir/worldservice/imam/speech/16.htm Khomeini's speech against capitalism], IRIB World Service.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Shirley 1997 207"&gt;Shirley, ''Know Thine Enemy'' (1997), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The "capitulation" law (or "status-of-forces agreement") allowed members of the U.S. armed forces in Iran to be tried in their own military courts. Khomeini was arrested in November 1964 and held for half a year. Upon his release, he was brought before Prime Minister [[Hassan-Ali Mansur|Hasan Ali Mansur]], who tried to convince Khomeini that he should apologize and drop his opposition to the government. When Khomeini refused, Mansur slapped Khomeini's face in a fit of rage.&lt;ref name="The Unknown Ayatullah Khomeini"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920508-5,00.html |title=The Unknown Ayatullah Khomeini – TIME |publisher=Time.com |date=16 July 1979 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, Mansur was assassinated on his way to parliament. Four members of the [[Fadayan-e Islam]] were later executed for the murder.

==Life in exile==

[[File:خمینی در ترکیه.JPG|thumb|Khomeini in exile at [[Bursa]], Turkey without clerical dress]]

Khomeini spent more than 14 years in exile, mostly in the holy [[Iraq|Iraqi]] city of [[Najaf]]. Initially, he was sent to Turkey on 4 November 1964 where he stayed in the city of [[Bursa]] hosted by a colonel in the Turkish Military Intelligence named Ali Cetiner in his own residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sciolino |first=Elaine |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E0D9153EF934A1575BC0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=nyt.com The People's Shah |work=The New York Times |date=27 August 2000 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1965, after less than a year, he was allowed to move to Najaf, Iraq, where he stayed until 1978, when he was expelled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisk|first1=Robert|title=The great war for civilisation : the conquest of the Middle East|date=2005|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=1400075173|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; by then-Vice President [[Saddam Hussein]]. By this time discontent with the Shah was becoming intense and Khomeini visited [[Neauphle-le-Château]], a suburb of [[Paris]], France on a [[tourist visa]] on 6 October 1978.&lt;ref name="Britannica01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Alexandre de Marenches]], chief of [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|External Documentation and Counter-Espionage Service]] (now known as the [[DGSE]]), the Shah did not ask France to expel Khomeini for fear that the cleric should move to Syria or Libya. (source: Christine Ockrent et Alexandre de Marenches, ''Dans le secret des princes'', Stock, 1986, {{ISBN|2-234-01879-X}}, p. 254)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources report that president [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] sent [[Michel Poniatowski]] to [[Tehran]] to propose to the Shah the elimination of Khomeini. (source: Christine Ockrent et Alexandre de Marenches, ''Dans le secret des princes'', Stock, 1986, {{ISBN|2-234-01879-X}}, p. 156, Ms Ockrent to Mr de Marenches: "[...] for instance, the mission of Mr Poniatowski to [[Tehran]] to propose to the Shah to eliminate Khomeini, then a refugee in France".)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Khomeini's House in Iraq-Najaf Ashraf by Samenp.jpg|thumb|150px|The Entrance of Khomeini's House in [[Najaf]], [[Iraq]]]]
[[File:خمینی در عراق.jpg|thumb|left|Khomeini at Najaf]]
By the late 1960s, Khomeini was a [[Marja'|marja]]-e taqlid (model for imitation) for "hundreds of thousands" of Shia, one of six or so models in the Shia world.&lt;ref&gt;Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; While in the 1940s Khomeini accepted the idea of a limited monarchy under the [[Iranian Constitution of 1906|Iranian Constitution of 1906–07]] – as evidenced by his book ''Kashf al-Asrar'' – by the 1970s he had rejected the idea. In early 1970, Khomeini gave a series of lectures in Najaf on Islamic government, later published as a book titled variously ''Islamic Government'' or ''[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist]]'' (''Hokumat-e Islami: Velayat-e faqih'').

This was his best known and most influential work, and laid out his ideas on governance (at that time):
* That the laws of society should be made up only of the laws of God (''[[Sharia]]''), which cover "all human affairs" and "provide instruction and establish norms" for every "topic" in "human life."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Islam and Revolution]]'' (1981), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since ''Shariah'', or Islamic law, is the proper law, those holding government posts should have knowledge of ''Sharia.'' Since Islamic jurists or faqih have studied and are the most knowledgeable in ''Sharia'', the country's ruler should be a ''[[faqih]]'' who "surpasses all others in knowledge" of Islamic law and justice,&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and Revolution'' (1981), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; (known as a [[marja al-taqlid|marja']]), as well as having intelligence and administrative ability. Rule by monarchs and/or assemblies of "those claiming to be representatives of the majority of the people" (i.e. elected parliaments and legislatures) has been proclaimed "wrong" by Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and Revolution'', (1981), p. 31, 56&lt;/ref&gt;
* This system of clerical rule is necessary to prevent injustice, corruption, oppression by the powerful over the poor and weak, innovation and deviation of Islam and Sharia law; and also to destroy anti-Islamic influence and conspiracies by non-Muslim foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and Revolution'' (1981), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified form of this ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|wilayat al-faqih]]'' system was adopted after Khomeini and his followers took power, and Khomeini was the Islamic Republic's first "Guardian" or "[[Supreme Leader]]". In the meantime, however, Khomeini was careful not to publicize his ideas for clerical rule outside of his Islamic network of opposition to the Shah which he worked to build and strengthen over the next decade. In Iran, a number of actions of the Shah including his repression of opponents began to build opposition to his regime.

[[File:Imam in Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Ayatollah Khomeini in front of his house at [[Neauphle-le-Chateau]] in a media conference]]

Cassette copies of his lectures fiercely denouncing the Shah as (for example) "the Jewish agent, the American serpent whose head must be smashed with a stone",&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini on a cassette tape [source: Gozideh Payam-ha Imam Khomeini (Selections of Imam Khomeini's Messages), Tehran, 1979, (Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'', (1985), p.193)&lt;/ref&gt; became common items in the markets of Iran,&lt;ref&gt;Parviz Sabeti, head of SAVAK's 'anti-subversion unit', believed the number of cassettes "exceeded 100,000." (Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'', (1985), p.193)&lt;/ref&gt; helped to demythologize the power and dignity of the Shah and his reign. Aware of the importance of broadening his base, Khomeini reached out to Islamic reformist and secular enemies of the Shah, despite his long-term ideological incompatibility with them.

After the 1977 death of [[Ali Shariati]] (an Islamic reformist and political revolutionary author/academic/philosopher who greatly assisted the [[Islamic revival]] among young educated Iranians), Khomeini became the most influential leader of the opposition to the Shah. Adding to his mystique was the circulation among Iranians in the 1970s of an old Shia saying attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kadhem. Prior to his death in 799, al-Kadhem was said to have prophesied that "A man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path".&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1996), p. 277; source: Quoted in Fouad Ajami, ''The Vanished Imam: Musa al Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1978, a rumour swept the country that Khomeini's face could be seen in the full moon. Millions of people were said to have seen it and the event was celebrated in thousands of mosques.&lt;ref&gt;Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'', p. 238, see also Gölz, [https://www.academia.edu/34634793/G%C3%B6lz_Olmo_Khomeinis_Face_is_in_the_Moon_Limitations_of_Sacredness_and_the_Origins_of_Sovereignty._In_Sakralit%C3%A4t_und_Heldentum_hrsg._von_Felix_Heinzer_J%C3%B6rn_Leonhard_und_Ralf_von_den_Hoff_229_244_Helden_-_Heroisierungen_-_Heroismen_6._W%C3%BCrzburg_Ergon_2017 "Khomeini's Face is in the Moon: Limitations of Sacredness and the Origins of Sovereignty."], In Sakralität und Heldentum.

Würzburg: Ergon, 2017, p. 229-244..&lt;/ref&gt; He was perceived by many Iranians as the spiritual as well as political leader of the revolt. Additionally, the episode with Khomeini's face in the moon showed that in late 1978 he was increasingly regarded as a messianic figure in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Gölz, [https://www.academia.edu/34634793/G%C3%B6lz_Olmo_Khomeinis_Face_is_in_the_Moon_Limitations_of_Sacredness_and_the_Origins_of_Sovereignty._In_Sakralit%C3%A4t_und_Heldentum_hrsg._von_Felix_Heinzer_J%C3%B6rn_Leonhard_und_Ralf_von_den_Hoff_229_244_Helden_-_Heroisierungen_-_Heroismen_6._W%C3%BCrzburg_Ergon_2017 "Khomeini's Face is in the Moon: Limitations of Sacredness and the Origins of Sovereignty."], In Sakralität und Heldentum.

As protests grew, so did his profile and importance. Although several thousand kilometers away from Iran in Paris, Khomeini set the course of the revolution, urging Iranians not to compromise and ordering work stoppages against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Harney, ''The Priest'' (1998), p.?&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few months of his exile, Khomeini received a constant stream of reporters, supporters, and notables, eager to hear the spiritual leader of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini was not allowed to return to Iran during the Shah's reign (as he had been in exile). On 16 January 1979, the Shah left the country (ostensibly "on vacation"), never to return.

Khomeini adamantly opposed the provisional government of [[Shapour Bakhtiar]], promising "I shall kick their teeth in.

It was "God's government," he warned, disobedience against him or Bazargan was considered a "revolt against God."&lt;ref&gt;Moin ''Khomeini'', (2000), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

As Khomeini's movement gained momentum, soldiers began to defect to his side and Khomeini declared ill fortune on troops who did not surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February, as revolt spread and armories were taken over, the military declared neutrality and the Bakhtiar regime collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 and 31 March 1979, a referendum to replace the monarchy with an Islamic Republic passed with 98% voting in favour of the replacement,&lt;ref name = "Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981 Encyclopædia Britannica].&lt;/ref&gt; with the question: "should the monarchy be abolished in favour of an Islamic Government?"

===Islamic constitution===
Although revolutionaries were now in charge and Khomeini was their leader, some opposition groups claim that several secular and religious groups were unaware of Khomeini's plan for Islamic government by ''wilayat al-faqih'', which involved rule by a marja' Islamic cleric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/269799.stm |title=World: Middle East Analysis: The forces for change |publisher=BBC News |date=2 February 1999 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that this provisional constitution for the Islamic Republic did not include the post of supreme Islamic clerical ruler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1QlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22constitution+of+iran%22+%22gave+his+approval+publicly+to+that+draft%22&amp;dq=%22constitution+of+iran%22+%22gave+his+approval+publicly+to+that+draft%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vWeOTbaaM8z3gAff3eXEDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA&amp;safe=active Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran''], (Tauris, 1997) p.22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html#Islamic_Clerics |title=Khomeini's REVERSALS of Promises |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic government was clearly defined by Khomeini in his book ''[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|Hokumat-e Islami: Velayat-e faqih]]'' (Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist) which was published while Khomeini was in exile in 1970, smuggled into Iran, and distributed to Khomeini's supporters. This book included Khomeini's notion of ''wilayat al-faqih'' (Governance of the Jurist) as well as the reasoning and in his view, the necessity of it in running an Islamic state.

Khomeini and his supporters worked to suppress some former allies and rewrote the proposed constitution. Some newspapers were closed, and those protesting the closings were attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Moin ''Khomeini'', (2000), p.219&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition groups such as the National Democratic Front and Muslim People's Republican Party were attacked and finally banned.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, Shaul, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'', p.68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Through popular support, Khomeini supporters gained an overwhelming majority of the seats in the Assembly of Experts&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, ''Constitution of Iran'' Tauris, 1997 p.22–23&lt;/ref&gt; which revised the proposed constitution. The newly proposed constitution included an Islamic jurist [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] of the country, and a [[Council of Guardians]] to veto un-Islamic legislation and screen candidates for office, disqualifying those found un-Islamic.

In November 1979, the new constitution of the Islamic Republic was adopted by national referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/iran.htm |title=Omar Sial: A Guide to the Legal System of the Islamic Republic of Iran |publisher=Nyulawglobal.org |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2010/10/12/detailed-analysis-iran%E2%80%99s-constitution|title=A Detailed Analysis of Iran’s Constitution, by Richard Horowitz, World Policy Institute Blog, 12 October 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini himself became instituted as the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] (Guardian Jurist), and officially became known as the "Leader of the Revolution."

===Hostage crisis===
{{Main|Iran hostage crisis}}
On 22 October 1979, the United States admitted the exiled and ailing Shah into the country for cancer treatment. In Iran, there was an immediate outcry, with both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. Revolutionaries were reminded of [[Operation Ajax]], 26 years earlier, when the Shah fled abroad while American CIA and British intelligence organized a coup d'état to overthrow his nationalist opponent [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB435/ |title=CIA Confirms Role in 1953 Iran Coup|date=August 19, 2013 |website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu |publisher=The National Security Archive |access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA19532013admission_rt"&gt;[http://rt.com/usa/iran-coup-cia-operation-647/ CIA finally admits it masterminded Iran's 1953 coup] ''RT News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 19.8.2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup|title=CIA admits role in 1953 Iranian coup|author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan|author2=Richard Norton-Taylor|work=The Guardian|date=19 August 2013|access-date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA19532013admission_cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/19/politics/cia-iran-1953-coup/?hpt=po_c2 |title=In declassified document, CIA acknowledges role in '53 Iran coup |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |access-date=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November, a group of Iranian college students calling themselves the [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]], took control of the American Embassy in Tehran, holding 52 embassy staff hostage for 444 days – an event known as the [[Iran hostage crisis]].  In the United States, the hostage-taking was seen as a flagrant violation of international law and aroused intense anger and [[anti-Iranian sentiment]]s.&lt;ref name="newstatesman.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2008/09/iran-ahmadinejad-government |title="Inside Iran", Maziar Bahari, Published 11 September 2008 |publisher=Newstatesman.com |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Mark, ''Guests of the Ayatollah'', Atlantic Monthly Press, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iran, the takeover was immensely popular and earned the support of Khomeini under the slogan "[[America can't do a damn thing against us]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Lolita in Tehran: a Memoir in Books'' by Azar Nafisi, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; The seizure of the embassy of a country he called the "[[Great Satan]]"&lt;ref name="katz2010"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Iran Primer: Power, Politics, and U.S. Policy | publisher=United States Institute of Peace | editor=Wright, Robin B. | page=186 | chapter=Iran and Russia | author=Katz, Mark N. | year=2010 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDgwl59s_hUC&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;ots=xy7W1akXVv&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;f=false | isbn=978-1-60127-084-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped to advance the cause of theocratic government and outflank politicians and groups who emphasized stability and normalized relations with other countries. Khomeini is reported to have told his president: "This action has many benefits ... this has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p.228&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution was successfully passed by referendum a month after the hostage crisis began.

The crisis had the effect of splitting of the opposition into two groups – radicals supporting the hostage taking, and the moderates opposing it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Example of anti-theocratic support for the hostage crisis in Nafisi, Azar, ''Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books'', Random House, 2003, p.105–106, 112&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 1980, Khomeini proclaimed Iran's [[Majlis]] would decide the fate of the American embassy hostages, and demanded that the United States hand over the Shah for trial in Iran for crimes against the nation. Although the Shah died a few months later, during the summer, the crisis continued. In Iran, supporters of Khomeini named the embassy a "[[Den of Espionage]]", publicizing details regarding armaments, espionage equipment and many volumes of official and classified documents which they found there.

===Relationship with Islamic and non-aligned countries===
Khomeini believed in Muslim unity and solidarity and the export of his revolution throughout the world. He believed Shia and (the significantly more numerous) Sunni Muslims should be "united and stand firmly against Western and arrogant powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imam Emphasized Unity Between Shia and Sunni: Ayatollah Mousawi Jazayeri|url=http://en.imam-khomeini.ir/en/n6322/News/Imam_Emphasized_Unity_Between_Shia_and_Sunni_Ayatollah_Mousawi_Jazayeri|website=Imam Khomeini|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran–Iraq War===
{{Main|Iran–Iraq War}}
[[File:KhomeiniRajai32.jpg|thumb|Ruhollah Khomeini with [[Ahmad Khomeini]] and [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]]]]
Shortly after assuming power, Khomeini began calling for Islamic revolutions across the [[Islamic world|Muslim world]], including Iran's Arab neighbor Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;1980 April 8 – Broadcast call by Khomeini for the pious of Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein and his regime. Al-Dawa al-Islamiya party in Iraqi is the hoped for catalyst to start rebellion. From: Mackey, ''The Iranians'', (1996), p.317&lt;/ref&gt; the one large state besides Iran with a Shia majority population. At the same time [[Saddam Hussein]], Iraq's secular Arab nationalist [[Baath Party|Ba'athist]] leader, was eager to take advantage of Iran's weakened military and (what he assumed was) revolutionary chaos, and in particular to occupy Iran's adjacent oil-rich province of [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country.

In September 1980, Iraq launched a full-scale invasion of Iran, starting what would become the eight-year-long [[Iran–Iraq War]] (September 1980 – August 1988). A combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and, despite Saddam's internationally condemned use of poison gas, Iran had by early 1982 regained almost all of the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowing him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, instead demanding reparations and the toppling of [[Saddam Hussein]] from power.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''In the Name of God'' (1989), p.126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Smith |first=William E. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |title=Time Magazine |work=Time |date=14 June 1982 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SRE.htm |title=The Iran–Iraq War: Strategy of Stalemate |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, there was an attempted military coup against Khomeini.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; The Iran–Iraq war ended in 1988, with 320,000–720,000 Iranian soldiers and militia killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB15.1D.GIF|title=Power Kills|first=Rudolph |last=Rummel|publisher=hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Iran's population and economy were three times the size of Iraq's, the latter was aided by neighboring Persian Gulf Arab states, as well as the Soviet Bloc and Western countries. The Persian Gulf Arabs and the West wanted to be sure the Islamic revolution did not spread across the Persian Gulf, while the Soviet Union was concerned about the potential threat posed to its rule in central Asia to the north. However, Iran had large amounts of ammunition provided by the United States of America during the Shah's era and the United States illegally smuggled arms to Iran during the 1980s despite Khomeini's anti-Western policy (see [[Iran–Contra affair]]).

During war Iranians used human wave attacks (people walking to certain death including child soldiers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_RqWaBZqLcC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=would+be+used+in+human%E2%80%94wave+attacks,+used+to+walk+over+minefields,+giving+their+lives+for+Khomeini,+brainwashed+into+thinking+that+it+was+sweeter+to+die,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bJkBQw-uOD&amp;sig=DYjEUkr3v02L6bIa76X48LReXAk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG7PSAuJ7UAhUB0SYKHR_QAnAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=would+be+used+in+human%E2%80%94wave+attacks,+used+to+walk+over+minefields,+giving+their+lives+for+Khomeini,+brainwashed+into+thinking+that+it+was+sweeter+to+die,&amp;f=false|title=The Cypress Tree|first=Kamin|last=Mohammadi|date=7 May 2012|publisher=A&amp;C Black|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIy5CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT872&amp;lpg=PT872&amp;dq=khomeini+human+wave+attack+promise+walking+to+certain+death&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NkvVo-8_pe&amp;sig=Ft7enCqmwFcCAwnvhRDb6KBWcB8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj62N-2t57UAhWGNiYKHT9QBKgQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=khomeini+human+wave+attack+promise+walking+to+certain+death&amp;f=false|title=Understanding the Volatile and Dangerous Middle East: A Comprehensive Analysis|first=Steven|last=Carol|date=25 August 2015|publisher=iUniverse|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Iraq, with his promise that they would automatically go to paradise—alJanna— if they died in battle,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; and his pursuit of victory in the [[Iran–Iraq War]] that ultimately proved futile.&lt;ref name=foreignpolicy.com_2013aug26&gt;{{cite web|last=SHANE HARRIS|first=MATTHEW M.

The war continued for over seven years with mounting costs. 1988 saw deadly month-long Iraqi missile attacks on Tehran, mounting economic problems, the demoralization of Iranian troops, attacks by the American Navy on Iranian ships, oil rigs, and [[Iran Air Flight 655|a commercial airplane]], and the recapture by Iraq of the [[Faw Peninsula]].

[[File:Ruhollah Khomeini - Jamaran, 1988.jpg|thumb|left|Khomeini in Jamaran, one year before his death]]
In July of that year, Khomeini, in his words, "drank the cup of poison" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. Despite the high cost of the war – 450,000 to 950,000 Iranian casualties and USD $300&amp;nbsp;billion&lt;ref&gt;(estimate by Iranian officials) Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p.252&lt;/ref&gt; – Khomeini insisted that extending the war into Iraq in an attempt to overthrow Saddam had not been a mistake. In a "Letter to Clergy" he wrote: "... we do not repent, nor are we sorry for even a single moment for our performance during the war. Have we forgotten that we fought to fulfill our religious duty and that the result is a marginal issue?"&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p.285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatwa against chemical weapons===
In an interview with [[Gareth Porter]], [[Mohsen Rafighdoost]], the eight-year war time minister of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]], disclosed how [[Khomeini]] had opposed his proposal for beginning working on both nuclear and chemical weapons by a fatwa which had never been made public in details of when and how it was issued.&lt;ref name="forein policy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Gareth|authorlink=Gareth Porter|title=When the Ayatollah Said No to Nukes|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/16/when-the-ayatollah-said-no-to-nukes/|accessdate=21 August 2015|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rushdie fatwa===
{{see also|The Satanic Verses controversy}}
[[File:Salman Rushdie, Satanic Verses -1988- illegal Iranian edition.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Persian [[Samizdat]] edition of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[The Satanic Verses|Satanic Verses]]'' c.2000]]

In early 1989, Khomeini issued a [[fatwā]] calling for the assassination of [[Salman Rushdie]], an India-born British author. Rushdie's book, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', published in 1988, was alleged to commit [[blasphemy]] against Islam and Khomeini's juristic ruling (fatwā) prescribed Rushdie's assassination by any Muslim. The fatwā required not only Rushdie's execution, but also the execution of "all those involved in the publication" of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woo|first=Richard|title=God Or Allah, Truth Or Bull?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vlvo5oQHSCkC|year=2011|publisher=Strategic Book Publishing|isbn=978-1-60976-813-3|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vlvo5oQHSCkC&amp;pg=PA10 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini's fatwā was condemned across the Western world by governments on the grounds that it violated the universal human rights of [[free speech]] and [[freedom of religion]]. The fatwā has also been attacked for violating the rules of [[fiqh]] by not allowing the accused an opportunity to defend himself, and because "even the most rigorous and extreme of the classical jurist only require a Muslim to kill anyone who insults the Prophet in his hearing and in his presence."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis's comment on Rushdie fatwa in ''The Crisis of Islam'' (2003), Bernard Lewis, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Rushdie publicly regretted "the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-regret.html |title=Rushdie regrets|work=The New York Times|date=19 February 1989|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Satanic Verses controversy|the fatwa]] was not revoked.

Rushdie himself was not killed but [[Hitoshi Igarashi]], the Japanese translator of the book ''The Satanic Verses'', was murdered and two other translators of the book survived murder attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-translator.html |title="Japanese Translator of Rushdie Book Found Slain" |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602193856/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-translator.html |archivedate=2 June 2002 |df=dmy-all }}, WEISMAN, Steven R.

==Life under Khomeini==
In a speech given to a huge crowd after returning to Iran from exile 1 February 1979, Khomeini made a variety of promises to Iranians for his coming Islamic regime: a popularly elected government that would represent the people of Iran and with which the clergy would not interfere. He promised that "no one should remain homeless in this country," and that Iranians would have free telephone, heating, electricity, bus services and free oil at their doorstep.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;258)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Khomeini's rule, [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) was introduced, with the Islamic dress code enforced for both men and women by [[Islamic Revolutionary Guards]] and other Islamic groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/basij.htm |title=Gobal Security, Intelligence: Niruyeh Moghavemat Basij – Mobilisation Resistance Force |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were required to cover their hair, and men were not allowed to wear shorts.

===Emigration and economy===
Khomeini is said to have stressed "the spiritual over the material".&lt;ref name="Sorenson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001), p.125)&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after his first speech he expressed exasperation with complaints about the sharp drop in Iran's standard of living, saying that: "I cannot believe that the purpose of all these sacrifices was to have less expensive melons."&lt;ref&gt;(Khomeini July 1979) [quoted in ''The Government of God'' p.111. see the FBIS for typical broadcasts, especially GBIS-MEA-79-L30, 5 July 1979 v.5 n.130, reporting broadcasts of the National Voice of Iran.]&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion emphasizing the importance of martyrdom over material prosperity, he said: "Could anyone wish his child to be martyred to obtain a good house? This is not the issue. The issue is another world."&lt;ref&gt;(Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001), p.125)(p.124-5 source: 'Khomeini to the Craftsmen' broadcast on Teheran Domestic Service 13 December 1979, FBIS-MEA-79-242)&lt;/ref&gt; He is also reportedly famous for answering a question about his economic policies by declaring that 'economics is for donkeys'.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', (2006), p.134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="donkey"&gt;The original quote which is part of a speech made in 1979 can be found [http://www.tebyan.net/newindex.aspx?pid=58950&amp;vn=9&amp;gpn=450 here]: &lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot imagine and no wise person can presume the claim that we spared our bloods so watermelon becomes cheaper. No wise person would sacrifice his young offspring for [say] affordable housing. People [on the contrary] want everything for their young offspring. Human being wants economy for his own self; it would therefore be unwise for him to spare his life in order to improve economy [...] Those who keep bringing up economy and find economy the infrastructure of everything -not knowing what human[ity] means- think of human being as an animal who is defined by means of food and clothes[...] Those who find economy the infrastructure of everything, find human beings animals. Animal too sacrifices everything for its economy and economy is its sole infrastructure. '''A donkey too considers economy as its only infrastructure'''. These people did not realize what human being [truly] is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This disinterest in economic policy is said to be "one factor explaining the inchoate performance of the Iranian economy since the revolution."&lt;ref name="Sorenson"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zrpmm4120OUC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=%22economics+is+for+donkeys%22+khomeini |title=An Introduction to the Modern Middle East, By David S.

Due to the [[Iran–Iraq war]], poverty is said to have risen by nearly 45% during the first 6 years of Khomeini's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the government's own Planning and Budget Organization statistics, from: Jahangir Amuzegar, 'The Iranian Economy before and after the Revolution,' ''Middle East Journal'' 46, n.3 (summer 1992): 421)&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration from Iran also developed, reportedly for the first time in the country's history.&lt;ref&gt;Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening : A Memoir of Revolution and Hope'' by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, p.78-9&lt;/ref&gt; Since the revolution and war with Iraq, an estimated "two to four million entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople (and their capital)" have emigrated to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;However, a significant degree of this can be attributed to Iranians fleeing during the war.[http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC04.php?CID=23 ''Iran's Economic Morass: Mismanagement and Decline under the Islamic Republic''] {{ISBN|0-944029-67-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Harrison |first=Frances |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6240287.stm |title=Huge cost of Iranian brain drain By Frances Harrison |publisher=BBC News |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression of opposition===
In a talk at the Fayzieah School in Qom, 30 August 1979, Khomeini warned pro-imperialist opponents: "Those who are trying to bring corruption and destruction to our country in the name of democracy will be oppressed. They are worse than [[Banu Qurayza|Bani-Ghorizeh]] Jews, and they must be hanged. We will oppress them by God's order and God's call to prayer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2003/August/Khomeini/ |title=Democracy?

However, in 1983, the [[CIA]] helped him by providing a list of Soviet [[KGB]] agents and collaborators operating in Iran to Khomeini, who then executed up to 200 suspects and closed down the Communist [[Tudeh Party of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-19/news/mn-4323_1_iranian-exile|title=CIA Support for Exiles, Other Covert Iran Activity Reported|first=BOB|last=WOODWARD|date=19 November 1986|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=John Tower|last1=Tower|first1=John|authorlink2=Edmund Muskie|last2=Muskie|first2=Edmund|authorlink3=Brent Scowcroft|last3=Scowcroft|first3=Brent|title=[[Tower Commission|Report of the President's Special Review Board]]|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|year=1987|p=104|isbn=9780553269680|quote=In 1983, the U.S. helped bring to the attention of Tehran the threat inherent in the extensive infiltration of the government by the communist Tudeh Party and Soviet or pro-Soviet cadres in the country.

The Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and his family left Iran and escaped harm, but hundreds of former members of the overthrown monarchy and military met their end in firing squads, with exiled critics complaining of "secrecy, vagueness of the charges, the absence of defense lawyers or juries", or the opportunity of the accused "to defend themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'' (1984), p.61&lt;/ref&gt; In later years these were followed in larger numbers by the erstwhile revolutionary allies of Khomeini's movement—Marxists and socialists, mostly university students—who opposed the theocratic regime. Following the 1981 [[Hafte Tir bombing]], Ayatollah Khomeini declared the Mojahedin and anyone violently opposed to the government, "enemies of God" and pursued a mass campaign against members of the Mojahedin, [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority)|Fadaiyan]], and [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh]] parties as well as their families, close friends, and even anyone who was accused of counterrevolutionary behavior.&lt;ref name="Moin, Baqer 2001 p.243"&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', 2001, p.243&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners]], following the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] unsuccessful operation Forough-e Javidan against the Islamic Republic, Khomeini issued an order to judicial officials to judge every Iranian political prisoner (mostly but not all Mujahedin) and kill those judged to be [[apostates from Islam]] (''mortad'') or "waging war on God" (''[[moharebeh]]'').  Almost all of those interrogated were killed, estimates of their number vary from 1,400&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holycrime.com/Images/Listof1367Massacre.pdf |title=Massacre 1988 (Pdf) |format=PDF |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 30,000.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=160 |title=Memories of a slaughter in Iran |publisher=Iranfocus.com |date=5 September 2004 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daneshjooyan.org/english/article/130403a.html ''The Millimeter Revolution'' By ELIZABETH RUBIN ].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minority religions===
{{see also|Persecution of Bahá'ís}}
[[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrians]], [[Persian Jews|Jews]], and [[Christians in Iran|Christians]] are officially recognized and protected by the government. Shortly after [[Khomeini's return]] from exile in 1979, he issued a fatwa ordering that Jews and other minorities (except [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]]) be treated well.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Last Revolution'' (2000), p.207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/iran.html |title=IRAN: Life of Jews Living in Iran |publisher=Sephardicstudies.org |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In power, Khomeini distinguished between [[Zionism]] as a secular political party that employs Jewish symbols and ideals and Judaism as the religion of [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Khomeini 'The Report Card on Jews Differs from That on the Zionists,' ''Ettelaat'', 11 May 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior government posts were reserved for Muslims. Schools set up by Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians had to be run by Muslim principals.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Last Great Revolution'', (2000), p.210&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion to Islam was encouraged by entitling converts to inherit the entire share of their parents (or even uncle's) estate if their siblings (or cousins) remain non-Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Last Great Revolution'', (2000), p.216&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's non-Muslim population has decreased. For example, the Jewish population in Iran dropped from 80,000 to 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Last Great Revolution'', (2000), p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the 270 seats in [[Majlis of Iran|parliament]] were reserved for each three non-Muslim minority religions, under the [[Constitution of Iran|Islamic constitution]] that Khomeini oversaw. Khomeini also called for unity between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Sunni Muslims are the largest religious minority in Iran. 4% belong to the Sunni branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manou &amp; associates Inc. SW Department |url=http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/people/index.html |title=Iran Fact Sheet |publisher=Iranonline.com |date= |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One non-Muslim group treated differently were the 300,000 members of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Starting in late 1979 the new government systematically targeted the leadership of the Bahá'í community by focusing on the Bahá'í [[Spiritual Assembly#National Spiritual Assemblies|National Spiritual Assembly]] (NSA) and [[Spiritual Assembly#Local Spiritual Assemblies|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] (LSAs); prominent members of NSAs and LSAs were often detained and even executed.&lt;ref name="ihrdc"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center |title=A Faith Denied: The Persecution of the Baha'is of Iran |year=2007 |accessdate=6 October 2007 |url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/pdfs/Reports/bahai_report.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127005930/http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/pdfs/Reports/bahai_report.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Some 200 of whom have been executed and the rest forced to convert or subjected to the most horrendous disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;''Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran'', by Said Amir Arjomand, Oxford University Press, 1988, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most conservative Muslims, Khomeini believed Bahá'í to be apostates.&lt;ref&gt;for example issuing a fatwa stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not acceptable that a tributary [non-Muslim who pays tribute] changes his religion to another religion not recognized by the followers of the previous religion.

===Ethnic minorities===
{{Main|Ethnic minorities in Iran}}
After the Shah left Iran in 1979, a Kurdish delegation traveled to Qom to present the Kurds' demands to Ayatollah Khomeini. Their demands included language rights and the provision for a degree of political autonomy. Khomeini responded that such demands were unacceptable since it involved the division of the Iranian nation. The following months saw numerous clashes between Kurdish militia groups and the Revolutionary Guards. The referendum on the Islamic Republic was massively boycotted in Kurdistan, where it was thought 85 to 90% of voters abstained. Khomeini ordered additional attacks later on in the year, and by September most of Iranian Kurdistan was under direct martial law.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Chaliand, ''A People Without a Country: The Kurds and Kurdistan'', Interlink Books, 1993.

==Death and funeral==

[[File:Funeral of Ruhollah Khomeini, 4 June 1989 (5).jpg|thumb|right|Mourning men in residence of Khomeini around his seat area, [[Jamaran]], 4 June 1989. ]]

Khomeini's health declined several years prior to his death. After spending eleven days in Jamaran hospital, Ruhollah Khomeini died on 3 June 1989 after suffering five heart attacks in just ten days,&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19890613&amp;id=PDseAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Jb8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6937,3485824|title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune – Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 86 just before midnight. He was succeeded as Supreme Leader by [[Ali Khamenei]]. Iranians poured out into the cities and streets in enormous numbers to mourn Khomeini's death in a spontaneous outpouring of grief. In the scorching summer heat, fire trucks sprayed water on the crowds to cool them. At least 10 mourners were trampled to death, more than 400 were badly hurt and several thousand more were treated for injuries sustained in the ensuing pandemonium.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''In the Name of God: The Khomeini Decade'' by Robin Wright, (1989), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Iran's official estimates, 10.2 million people lined the {{convert|32|km|mi|adj=on}} route to Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery on 11 June 1989, for the funeral of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Western agencies estimated that 2&amp;nbsp;million paid their respects as the body lay in state.&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-percentage-of-population-to-attend-a-funeral|title=Largest percentage of population to attend a funeral &amp;#124; Guinness World Records|publisher=guinnessworldrecords.com|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures about Khomeini's initial funeral attendance which took place on 4 June range around 2.5–3.5&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-06-07/news/8902070407_1_ayatollah-ruhollah-khomeini-ahmad-khomeini-mourners |title=Mourners Rip Shroud, Khomeini`s Body Falls – Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=7 June 1989 |accessdate=2 March 2014 |first1=Ray |last1=Moseley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Germany-to-Jamaica/Iranians.html |title=Iranians – Introduction, Location, Language, Folklore, Religion, Major holidays, Rites of passage, Relationships, Living conditions |publisher=Every Culture|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early the following day, Khomeini's corpse was flown in by helicopter for burial at the [[Behesht-e Zahra|Paradise of Zahra cemetery]]. Iranian officials postponed Khomeini's first funeral after a huge mob stormed the funeral procession, destroying Khomeini's wooden coffin in order to get a last glimpse of his body or touch of his coffin. In some cases, armed soldiers were compelled to fire warning shots in the air to restrain the crowds. At one point, Khomeini's body fell to the ground, as the crowd ripped off pieces of the death shroud, trying to keep them as if they were holy relics. According to journalist James Buchan:

{{quote|Yet even here, the crowd surged past the makeshift barriers. John Kifner wrote in ''The New York Times'' that the "body of the Ayatollah, wrapped in a white burial shroud, fell out of the flimsy wooden coffin, and in a mad scene people in the crowd reached to touch the shroud". A frail white leg was uncovered. The shroud was torn to pieces for relics and Khomeini's son Ahmad was knocked from his feet. Men jumped into the grave. At one point, the guards lost hold of the body. Firing in the air, the soldiers drove the crowd back, retrieved the body and brought it to the helicopter, but mourners clung on to the landing gear before they could be shaken off. The body was taken back to North Tehran to go through the ritual of preparation a second time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2009/03/khomeini-funeral-body-crowd Ayatollah Khomeini's funeral: The funeral of Ayatollah Khomeini was not a tragedy but a gruesome farce], James Buchan, ''[[New Statesman]]'', 12 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The second funeral was held under much tighter security five hours later. This time, Khomeini's casket was made of steel, and in accordance with Islamic tradition, the casket was only to carry the body to the burial site. In 1995, his son [[Ahmad Khomeini|Ahmad]] was buried next to him. [[Mausoleum of Khomeini|Khomeini's grave]] is now housed within a larger mausoleum complex.

{{main|Iranian Supreme Leader election, 1989}}
[[File:President Ali Khamenei visit to Ruhollah Khomeini - August 13, 1986.jpg|thumb|Khomeini and his successor, [[Ali Khamenei]]]]

Grand Ayatollah [[Hussein-Ali Montazeri]], a former student of Khomeini and a major figure of the Revolution, was chosen by Khomeini to be his successor as Supreme Leader and approved as such by the [[Assembly of Experts]] in November 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, ''Iranians'', (1998), p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|velayat-e faqih]]'' and the Islamic constitution called for the Supreme Leader to be a ''marja'' (a grand ayatollah), and of the dozen or so grand ayatollahs living in 1981 only Montazeri qualified as a potential Leader (this was either because only he accepted totally Khomeini's concept of rule by Islamic jurists,&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;Roy, Olivier, ''The Failure of Political Islam'', translated by Carol Volk Harvard University Press, 1994, pp. 173–74.

Following the execution of thousands of political prisoners by the Islamic government, Montazeri told Khomeini 'your prisons are far worse than those of the Shah and his SAVAK.'&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Khomeini's letter, in Resalat, cited in ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs: Iran and the Islamic Revolution'', rev. ed. by Shaul Bakhash, p.282&lt;/ref&gt; After a letter of his complaints was leaked to Europe and broadcast on the [[BBC]], a furious Khomeini ousted him from his position as official successor.

To deal with the disqualification of the only suitable ''marja'', Khomeini called for an 'Assembly for Revising the Constitution' to be convened. An amendment was made to Iran's constitution removing the requirement that the [[Supreme Leader]] be a Marja&lt;ref name="Roy" /&gt; and this allowed [[Ali Khamenei]], the new favoured jurist who had suitable revolutionary credentials but lacked scholarly ones and who was not a Grand Ayatollah, to be designated as successor.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, Sandra''The Iranians'' (1996), p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; Ayatollah Khamenei was elected Supreme Leader by the [[Assembly of Experts]] on 4 June 1989.

Khomeini's concept of [[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist]] (ولایت فقیه, ''velayat-e faqih'') as Islamic government did not win the support of the leading Iranian Shi'i clergy of the time.&lt;ref name="Roy-p173"&gt;''The Failure of Political Islam'' by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk Harvard University Press, 1994, p.173–74 quoted in [http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html#footnote_58d "the vilayat-i faqih thesis was rejected by almost the entire dozen grand ayatollahs living in 1981"]&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the 1979 Revolution, many clerics gradually became disillusioned with the rule of the Shah, although none came around to supporting Khomeini's vision of a theocratic Islamic Republic.&lt;ref name="Roy-p173"/&gt;

There is much debate to as whether Khomeini's ideas are or are not compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be a democratic republic. According to the state-run ''Aftab News'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdcdzn0ytj05s.html Ganji, Sorush and Mesbah Yazdi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629045409/http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdcdzn0ytj05s.html |date=29 June 2010 }}(Persian)&lt;/ref&gt; both ultraconservative ([[Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi]]) and reformist opponents of the regime ([[Akbar Ganji]] and [[Abdolkarim Soroush]]) believe he did not, while regime officials and supporters like Ali Khamenei,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parstech.org/detail.php?id=1313 The principles of Islamic Republic from viewpoint of Imam Khomeini in the speeches of the leader](Persian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohammad Khatami]] and [[Mortaza Motahhari]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motahari.org/asaar/books/downlowd/32/book.zip About Islamic republic]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}(Persian)&lt;/ref&gt; believe Khomeini intended the [[Islamic republic]] to be democratic and that it is so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/18/1/14?ck=nck |title=Ayatollah Khomeini and the Contemporary Debate on Freedom |doi=10.1093/jis/etl042 |publisher=Jis.oxfordjournals.org |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini himself also made statements at different times indicating both support and opposition to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Democracy?

[[File:Women meeting with Khomeini, 1 April 1979.jpg|thumb|Khomeini greeted by the people]]

One scholar, [[Shaul Bakhash]], explains this disagreement as coming from Khomeini's belief that the huge turnout of Iranians in anti-Shah demonstrations during the revolution constituted a 'referendum' in favor of an Islamic republic.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'' (1984), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini also wrote that since Muslims must support a government based on Islamic law, Sharia-based government will always have more popular support in Muslim countries than any government based on elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution'' (1982), p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini offered himself as a "champion of Islamic revival" and unity, emphasizing issues Muslims agreed upon – the fight against Zionism and imperialism – and downplaying Shia issues that would divide Shia from [[Sunni]].&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton (2006), p.137&lt;/ref&gt;
Khomeini strongly opposed close relations with either [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern]] or [[Western Bloc]] nations, believing the Islamic world should be its own bloc, or rather converge into a single unified power.&lt;ref&gt;''Bayan'', No.4 (1990), p.8)&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed Western culture as being inherently decadent and a corrupting influence upon the youth. The Islamic Republic banned or discouraged popular Western fashions, music, cinema, and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4543720.stm |title=Iran president bans Western music |publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2005 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western world it is said "his glowering visage became the virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture" and "inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam,"&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; making the word 'Ayatollah' "a synonym for a dangerous madman ... in popular parlance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-476/_nr-1103/i.html |title=A Revolution Misunderstood. Charlotte Wiedemann |publisher=Qantara.de |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has particularly been the case in the United States where some Iranians complained that even at universities they felt the need to hide their Iranian identity for fear of physical attack.&lt;ref name="newstatesman.com"/&gt; There Khomeini and the Islamic Republic are remembered for the [[Iran hostage crisis|American embassy hostage taking]] and accused of sponsoring hostage-taking and terrorist attacks,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', (2001), p.28, 33,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for example the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] see:''Hizb'allah in Lebanon : The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis'' Magnus Ranstorp, Department of International Relations University of St. Andrews
St. Martins Press, New York, 1997, p.54, 117&lt;/ref&gt; and which continues to apply economic [[sanctions against Iran]].

Before taking power Khomeini expressed support for the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. "We would like to act according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We would like to be free. We would like independence."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sahifeh Nour]]'' (Vol.2 Page 242)&lt;/ref&gt; However once in power Khomeini took a firm line against dissent, warning opponents of theocracy for example: "I repeat for the last time: abstain from holding meetings, from blathering, from publishing protests. Otherwise I will break your teeth."&lt;ref&gt;in Qom, Iran, 22 October 1979, quoted in, ''The Shah and the Ayatollah : Iranian Mythology and Islamic Revolution'' by Fereydoun Hoveyda, Westport, Conn. : Praeger, 2003, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Khomeini's political and religious ideas were considered to be progressive and reformist by leftist intellectuals and activists prior to the Revolution. However, once in power his ideas often clashed with those of modernist or secular Iranian intellectuals. This conflict came to a head during the writing of the Islamic constitution when many newspapers were closed by the government. Khomeini angrily told the intellectuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, we are [[reactionary|reactionaries]], and you are [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] intellectuals: You intellectuals do not want us to go back 1400 years. You, who want [[freedom (political)|freedom]], freedom for everything, the freedom of parties, you who want all the freedoms, you intellectuals: freedom that will corrupt our youth, freedom that will pave the way for the oppressor, freedom that will drag our nation to the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;p.47, Wright. source: Speech at Feyziyeh Theological School, 24 August 1979; reproduced in Rubin, Barry and Judith Colp Rubin, ''Anti-American Terrorism and the Middle East: A Documentary Reader'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Esfahan (Iran) Emam Place with Emam Mosque.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Murals of Khomeini and [[Ali Khamenei]], [[Shah Mosque]] in Isfahan]]
In contrast to his alienation from Iranian intellectuals, and "in an utter departure from all other Islamist movements," Khomeini embraced international revolution and [[Third World]] solidarity, giving it "precedence over Muslim fraternity." From the time Khomeini's supporters gained control of the media until his death, the Iranian media "devoted extensive coverage to non-Muslim revolutionary movements (from the [[Sandinista]]s to the [[African National Congress]] and the [[Irish Republican Army]]) and downplayed the role of the Islamic movements considered conservative, such as the [[Afghan mujahideen|Afghan mujahidin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Roy, ''The Failure of Political Islam''. 1994, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini's legacy to the economy of the Islamic Republic has been expressions of concern for the ''mustazafin'' (a [[Quran]]ic term for the oppressed or deprived), but not always results that aided them. During the 1990s the ''mustazafin'' and disabled war veterans rioted on several occasions, protesting the demolition of their shantytowns and rising food prices, etc.&lt;ref&gt;In March 1992, disabled war veterans protested against the mismanagement of the Foundation of the Disinherited. January and May 1992. In January 1992 a Tehran mob attacked grocery stores in a protest against the rise in subsidized milk prices. In May 1992 there were protests by squatters against the demolition of shantytowns in Mashhad. Government buildings were set alight. (Mackey, Sandra, ''The Iranians : Persia, Islam and the soul of a nation'', Dutton, c1996. p.361, 362, 366). Quoted in [http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html#Class_Division Class Division and Poverty Will Not Be Tolerated]&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini's disdain for the science of economics ("economics is for donkeys"&lt;ref group="note" name="donkey"/&gt;) is said to have been "mirrored" by the populist redistribution policies of former president, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], who allegedly wears "his contempt for economic orthodoxy as a badge of honour", and has overseen sluggish growth and rising inflation and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2008/09/iran-economic-ahmadinejad |title="Economics is for donkeys" Robert Tait. 11 September 2008 |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini wrote a book in which he stated that there is no religious restriction on corrective surgery for [[Transsexuality in Iran|transgender individuals]]. At the time Khomeini was an anti-Shah revolutionary and his fatwas did not carry any weight with the Imperial government, which did not have any specific policies regarding transsexual individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tait, [http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/28/iran_transsexuals/print.html A fatwa for transsexuals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606185558/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/28/iran_transsexuals/print.html |date=6 June 2011 }}, and [https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1536658,00.html a similar article] on [[The Guardian]]. Gives details on Molkara's plea.&lt;/ref&gt;  
However, after 1979, his fatwa "formed the basis for a national policy" and perhaps in part because of a penal code that "allows for the execution of homosexuals", as of 2005 Iran "permits and partly finances seven times as many gender reassignment operation as the entire [[European Union]]".&lt;ref name=kadri-251&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=251|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tait|first1=Robert |title=A fatwa for freedom |agency=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/27/gayrights.iran |date=27 July 2005 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and habits==
Khomeini was described as "slim", but athletic and "heavily boned".&lt;ref name=taheri1986&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taheri|first1=Amir|title=The spirit of Allah: Khomeini and the Islamic revolution|date=1986|publisher=Adler &amp; Adler|location=Bethesda, Md.|isbn=9780917561047|edition=1st U.S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known for his punctuality:

{{quote|He's so punctual that if he doesn't turn up for lunch at exactly ten past everyone will get worried, because his work is regulated in such a way that he turned up for lunch at exactly that time every day. He goes to bed exactly on time. He eats exactly on time. And he wakes up exactly on time. He changes his cloak every time he comes back from the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;According to a daughter quoted in ''In the Name of God'' by Robin Wright, 1989, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Khomeini was also known for his aloofness and austere demeanor. He is said to have had "variously inspired admiration, awe, and fear from those around him."&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001), p.53&lt;/ref&gt; His practice of moving "through the halls of the madresehs never smiling at anybody or anything; his practice of ignoring his audience while he taught, contributed to his charisma."&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians'' (198?) p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini adhered to traditional beliefs of [[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence]] holding that things like urine, excrement, blood, wine etc. and also non-Muslims were some of eleven ritualistically "impure" things that physical contact with which while wet required ritual washing or [[Ghusl]] before prayer or [[salat]].&lt;ref&gt;fatwa No. 83 from ''A Clarification of Questions : An Unabridged Translation of ''Resaleh Towzih al-Masael,'' by Ayatollah Syed Ruhollah Moosavi Khomeini, Translated by J. Borujerdi, with a Foreword by Michael M. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, Westview Press/ Boulder and London c1984, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.383&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have refused to eat or drink in a restaurant unless he knew for sure the waiter was a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Personal communications from Dr. Mansur Farhang, a biographer and supporter of Khomeini who was the former Iranian representative at the United Nations, with Ervand Abrahamian. Quoted in Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Khomeinism : Essays on the Islamic Republic'' University of California Press, (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mystique==
Khomeini was noted by many for his mystique. Before the revolution he benefited from the widespread circulation of a [[Hadith]] attributed to the Imam [[Musa al-Kazim]] who is said to have prophesied shortly before his death in 799 that:

{{quote|A man will come out from [[Qom]] and he will summon people to the right path. There will rally to him people resembling pieces of iron, not to be shaken by violent winds, unsparing and relying on God&lt;ref&gt;(Mackay ''Iranians'', p.277. Source: Quoted in Fouad Ajami, ''The Vanished Imam: Musa al Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986), p.25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Khomeini was the first and only Iranian cleric to be addressed as "Imam", a title hitherto reserved in Iran for the [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|twelve infallible leaders]] of the early Shi'a.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p.201&lt;/ref&gt; He was also associated with the ''[[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Mahdi]]'' or 12th Imam of Shia belief in a number of ways. One of his titles was ''Na'eb-e Imam'' (Deputy to the [[Twelfth Imam]]). His enemies were often attacked as ''[[taghut]]'' and ''[[Mofsed-e-filarz]]'' (corrupters of the earth), religious terms used for enemies of the Twelfth Imam. Many of the officials of the overthrown Shah's government executed by Revolutionary Courts were convicted of "fighting against the Twelfth Imam". When a deputy in the [[Majlis of Iran|majlis]] asked Khomeini directly if he was the 'promised Mahdi', Khomeini did not answer, "astutely" neither confirming nor denying the title.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:بچه و خمینی.JPG|thumb|right|Khomeini and a child.]]

As the revolution gained momentum, even some non-supporters exhibited awe, called him "magnificently clear-minded, single-minded and unswerving."&lt;ref&gt;Harney, ''The Priest and the King'' (1998) pp. 173–4&lt;/ref&gt; His image was as "absolute, wise, and indispensable leader of the nation"&lt;ref&gt;Benard/Khalilzad, ''The Government of God'', 1984, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Imam, it was generally believed, had shown by his uncanny sweep to power, that he knew how to act in ways which others could not begin to understand. His timing was extraordinary, and his insight into the motivation of others, those around him as well as his enemies, could not be explained as ordinary knowledge. This emergent belief in Khomeini as a divinely guided figure was carefully fostered by the clerics who supported him and spoke up for him in front of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Moin ''Khomeini'', (2000), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even many [[secularist]]s who firmly disapproved of his policies were said to feel the power of his "messianic" appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''In the Name of God'', (1989) (p.21-22)&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing him to a father figure who retains the enduring loyalty even of children he disapproves of, journalist [[Afshin Molavi]] writes that defenses of Khomeini are "heard in the most unlikely settings":

{{quote|A whiskey-drinking professor told an American journalist that Khomeini brought pride back to Iranians. A women's rights activist told me that Khomeini was not the problem; it was his conservative allies who had directed him wrongly. A nationalist war veteran, who held Iran's ruling clerics in contempt, carried with him a picture of 'the Imam'.&lt;ref&gt;Molavi, ''The Soul of Iran'', (2005), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another journalist tells the story of listening to bitter criticism of the regime by an Iranian who tells her of his wish for his son to leave the country and who "repeatedly" makes the point "that life had been better" under the Shah. When his complaint is interrupted by news that "the Imam" — over 85 years old at the time — might be dying, the critic becomes "ashen faced" and speechless, pronouncing "this is terrible for my country."&lt;ref&gt;''In the Name of God: The Khomeini Decade'' by Robin Wright c 1989, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of  Khomeini's charisma is the effect a half-hour-long, 1982 speech on the Quran by him  had on a [[Muslim]] Scholar from South Africa, [[Ahmad Deedat|Sheikh Ahmad Deedat]]:
{{quote|...  And the electric effect he had on everybody, his charisma, was amazing. You just look at the man and tears come down your cheek. You just look at him and you get tears. I never saw a more handsome old man in my life, no picture, no video, no TV could do justice to this man, the handsomest old man I ever saw in my life was this man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inminds.com/unity.html|title=Sunni-Shia Unity, A lecture by Sheikh Ahmad Deedat|publisher=inminds.com|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among some non-Muslim supporters, Khomeini made a different but also favorable impression. Before Khomeini's coming to power, American academic and activist [[Richard A. Falk]] wrote that, "the depiction of him [Khomeini] as fanatical, reactionary and the bearer of crude prejudices seems certainly and happily false".&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;Eli Lake, [http://www.nysun.com/news/foreign/un-official-calls-study-neocons-role-911 "U.N. Official Calls for Study Of Neocons' Role in 9/11"], ''[[The New York Sun]]'', April 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Khomeini's "entourage was uniformly composed of moderate, progressive individuals,"&lt;ref name=Sick&gt;Gary Sick, ''All fall down: America's fateful encounter in Iran'', I.B.Tauris, 1985,  [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=All+fall+down%3A+America%27s+fateful+encounter+in+Iran+By+Gary+Sick+%22richard+falk%22+khomeini&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;safe=active p. 166].&lt;/ref&gt; and that "having created a new model of popular revolution based, for the most part, on nonviolent tactics, Iran may yet provide us with a desperately-needed model of humane governance for a third-world country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/gloview021511.pdf|title=Trusting Khomeini|date=February 16, 1979|publisher=The New York Times|format=pdf |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
On the thirteenth anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's death, [[Hezbollah]]'s [[Hassan Nasrallah|Nasrollah]] presented a lecture on significance the Khomeini to international. He drew parallels between Khomeini's revolution struggles and suffering and those of the Lebanon resistance factions and the Palestinian intifada and resistance. In particular,  Khomeini's tactics, and particularly his steadfastness and intelligence, had greater relevance because Khomeini's movement was not a political one severed from its roots or a Jihadi revival movement disconnected from ideology, but a movement that rested on a very solid base. The domestic struggle between Ayatollah Khomeini and the Pahlavi regime was far less important, than that the Shah was an agent and instrument of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellen Khouri|title=voice of Hezbollah: the statements of Sayyed hasan Nasrollah|year=2002|pages=267–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Little''' (born June 7, 1940) is an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. In 2014, he was charged with the murder of three women in [[California]] between 1987 and 1989. After this conviction, California authorities said that he might have killed people in nine states from 1982 onwards. He claims to have killed as many as 90 people; investigators claim to have linked him to at least 34  murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/samuel-little-serial-killer-murderer.html|title=He Says He Got Away With 90 Murders.

== Biography ==
Little was born on June 7, 1940, in [[Reynolds, Georgia]], possibly during one of his mother's prison stints. Little has claimed his mother was a "[[Prostitution|lady of the night]]."&lt;ref name="nyt26nov"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Timothy |title=He Says He Got Away With 90 Murders.

He grew up in [[Lorain, Ohio|Lorain]] and was brought up mainly by his grandmother. He attended [[Lorain City School District|Hawthorne Junior High School]], where he had problems with discipline and achievement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/04/suspect_who_grew_up_in_lorain.html|title=Sam Little, who grew up in Lorain, is linked to serial killer probes |date=8 April 2013 |author=John Caniglia |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, while still a high school student, Little was arrested for the first time and convicted for breaking and entering into property in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. He was held in an institution for juvenile offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/07/timeline-retraces-whereabouts-career-criminal-alleged-serial-killer.html|title=Timeline retraces the whereabouts of a career criminal, alleged serial killer |date= 7 April 2013 |publisher=Associated Press |via=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, Little moved to [[Florida]], where he lived with his mother. He worked as an ambulance attendant and then a cemetery worker. Having a strong physique, Little took up [[boxing]] during prison time and considered himself a prizefighter at one point.&lt;ref name="StarAdvertiser"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/breaking-news/more-cases-connected-to-l-a-serial-killer-suspect/ |title=More cases connected to L.A. serial killer suspect |author=Tami Abdollah |date=7 April 2013| newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little did not continue his education after high school, spending most of his free time on the streets, engaging in petty theft and occasionally working part time as a [[day labor]]er.

== Crimes ==
Little was arrested in 1961 and sentenced to three years in prison for breaking into a furniture store in Lorain. He was released in 1964. He left Ohio and shuttled between different states for the following few years and made a living through robbery and theft.

By 1975, Little had been arrested 26 times in 11 states for crimes including theft, assault, attempted rape, fraud and attacks on government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/07/timeline-retraces-whereabouts-career-criminal-alleged-serial-killer.html|title=Timeline retraces the whereabouts of a career criminal, alleged serial killer |date=7 April 2013 |publisher=Associated Press |via=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little spent much of his time with [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimps]]. In 1982 he was arrested in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]], and charged with the murder of 22-year-old prostitute Melinda LaPree, who had gone missing in September that year.

A [[grand jury]] declined to indict Little for the murder of LaPree. But while under investigation Little was transferred to Florida to be brought to trial for the murder of 26-year-old Patricia Mount, whose body was found in the fall of 1982. Prosecution witnesses identified Little in court as a person who spent time with Mount on the night before her disappearance.

Due to mistrust of witness testimonies, Little was acquitted in January 1984 of Mount's murder.&lt;ref name="StarAdvertiser" /&gt; Little then moved to California, where he stayed in the vicinity of [[San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/01/suspect-1980s-slayings-arrested.html|title=Exclusive: LAPD arrests serial killer suspect from 1980s.

He was released in February 1987 and soon moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he committed several murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81233791/|title=Women's testimony called 'blueprint' to serial killer suspect's behavior |date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little was arrested on September 5, 2012, at a [[homeless shelter]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], after authorities used [[Genealogical DNA test|DNA testing]] to establish that he was involved in the murder of Carol Elford, killed on July 13, 1987; Audrey Nelson, killed on August 14, 1989; and Guadalupe Abodacha, killed on September 3, 1987. All three women were killed and later found on the streets of Los Angeles. 

Little was extradited to Los Angeles, where he was charged on January 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/52723|title=Man Linked to Three Cold Case Murders. Monday, January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, the police said that Little was being investigated for involvement in dozens of murders committed in the 1980s, which until then had been undisclosed. In connection with the new circumstances in the state of Mississippi, the case of the murder of LaPree was reopened, in which Little was acquitted in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2013/04/cross-country-killer-samuel-little-tied-to-cold-case-murders-in/|title=Cross-Country Killer: Samuel Little Tied to Cold Case Murders in 10 States? at April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Little was tested for involvement in 60 murders of women committed in the territory of many US states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/news/20130402/local-records-chief-hailed-for-helping-crack-nationwide-cold-case|title=man suspected of killing dozens of women across the United States over the course of decades |date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and incarceration ==
The trial of Samuel Little for the murders of Elford, Nelson and Abodacha began in September 2014. The prosecution presented the DNA testing results as well as testimony of witnesses who were attacked by the accused at different times throughout his criminal career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81233791/|title=Women's testimony called 'blueprint' to serial killer suspect's behavior |date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press-news/2014/09/former_pascagoula_prostitutes.html|title=Former Pascagoula prostitutes testify of escapes from convicted serial killer Samuel Little. on September 04, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 25, 2014, Little was found guilty and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] without possibility of [[parole]].

'''Opul Lun Sat-Yr-9''' (also spelled '''Sat-Yr-nin''') is a fictional character, a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=April 2014}}
Sat-Yr-9 first appeared in the UK title ''Captain Britain Monthly'' #3 (1984), and was created by [[Alan Davis]]. Her first US appearance was in ''[[Excalibur (comic book)|Excalibur]]'' #3 (1988).

==Fictional character biography==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Satyr9.PNG|thumb|100px|Sat-Yr-9 as the Mastrex of Briton.|left]] --&gt;
===Dictator===

Opul Lun Sat-Yr-9 is the [[dictator]] of Earth-794, along with her lover [[Kaptain Briton]]. When he flees to [[Earth-616]] where he has an identical looking counterpart ([[Earth-616]]'s [[Captain Britain]]), she sends armored troops to retrieve him. They mistakenly attack Captain Britain twice, but are repelled on each occasion. Sat-Yr-9 hires the interdimensional mercenary group, the [[Technet (comics)|Technet]], but Briton swaps places with Britain, and the Technet take the wrong man back to Earth-794.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #2&lt;/ref&gt; Britain later convinces the Technet of their error.  When Sat-Yr-9 tries to stop them departing with Britain, the Technet slaughter her soldiers; the already psychotic Sat-Yr-9 becomes completely unhinged.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #6&lt;/ref&gt; She kills her subjects, leading [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] to send [[Captain UK]] on a mission to overthrow and imprison her.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #14&lt;/ref&gt;  While Britain is on Earth-794, Briton is killed by [[Psylocke|Betsy Braddock]] when he tries to rape her.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Britain vol. 2 #7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courtney Ross===
[[Image:CourtneySatyr9.PNG|Sat-Yr-9 kills Courtney Ross to take her place. Art by [[Alan Davis]].|thumb|left]]
Escaping to Earth-616 through a dimensional gateway that had been opened by [[Widget (comics)|Widget]], Sat-Yr-9 kills her alternate reality counterpart, a businesswoman named [[Courtney Ross]] (and Captain Britain's ex-girlfriend), and takes her place.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; As Ross, she tries to create a rift between Captain Britain and his current girlfriend [[Meggan]].

Sat-Yr-9 knows about [[Jamie Braddock]]'s reality warping powers before anyone else (including Jamie himself), since she has already encountered Jamie's alternate reality counterpart.  Sat-Yr-9 challenges Ross's coworker (and secret admirer) Nigel Frobisher to a high-stakes card game at the London [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], and wins. Frobisher agrees to serve her, and she orders him to rescue the Earth-616 Jamie Braddock from Doc Croc, intending to use his powers as a living weapon against her adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #9, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Sat-Yr-9 takes [[Kitty Pryde]] under her guidance,&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #21&lt;/ref&gt; enrolling Kitty in the St. Searle's School for Young Ladies, and arranges a deal to save St. Searle's from bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #32, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Sat-Yr-9 uses Jamie's powers to change Frobisher into a duplicate of the female criminal [[Vixen (Marvel Comics)|Vixen]], while changing the real Vixen into a fox. With Frobisher replacing Vixen, Sat-Yr-9 takes over the Vixen's crime syndicate.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  Her powerbase built, Sat-Yr-9 attacks [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], revealing her true identity to them. She tries to enslave Captain Britain (with the implication she [[Male_rape#Female-on-male_rape|rapes]] him while he is under her mind control), against Frobisher's advice. Frobisher, already humiliated by Sat-Yr-9's treatment of him, rebels, but is killed by her. Excalibur defeats Jamie, and Sat-Yr-9 and her troops are forced to flee.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Captain Britain swears to avenge Courtney's death, but is unable to track down Sat-Yr-9.

===Hellfire Club===
After the events of [[House of M]], Sat-Yr-9 returns.  Still posing as the Earth-616 Courtney Ross, she has joined the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] as its White Queen, with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], a former HYDRA assassin, as her self-proclaimed "White Princess" and bodyguard. She tries to convince Captain Britain that she is the real Courtney Ross. Captain Britain remains unconvinced, but has not moved against her.

==Other versions==
*Another version of the character is [[Saturnyne]], the Omniversal Majestrix of [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]] and a servant of Roma. {{issue|date=July 2018}}
*An alternate version of Sat-Yr-9 appears in ''[[Paradise X]]: Heralds'', where she displays the power to control men through pheromones. The regular Sat-Yr-9 never displayed this ability. This version is called Saturnyne, despite her appearance being that of Sat-Yr-9.{{issue|date=July 2018}}

'''Sorcha MacMahon''' (20 July 1888 – 13 December 1970) was an Irish nationalist and [[Irish republicanism|republican]] who was active during the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 and both the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]] and the [[Irish Civil War]].

==Early life==
She was born Sarah Teresa MacMahon to James and Sarah MacMahon of  Coas, [[County Monaghan]] in 1888. She was one of four boys and three girls.  She  used the Irish form of her name, Sorcha. [[Irish Language|Irish]] was the family's first language. She was educated in Laggan National School and St Louis School in Monaghan. After school she went to [[Dublin]] and took a commercial course. She then worked as a bookkeeper for Taggart's Garage.&lt;ref name="irishexaminer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/seven-women-who-played-a-key-part-in-1916-and-beyond-impacting-on-society-383228.html|title=Seven women who played a key part in 1916 and beyond, impacting on society|author=Sinead McCoole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Easter Rising==
An early member of [[Cumann na mBan]], in 1914 MacMahon was the local secretary of the Central Branch and was secretary nationally in 1916.&lt;ref name="irishexaminer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/cumann-na-mban-by-joseph-e-a-connell-jr/|title=Cumann na mBan by Joseph E.A. Connell Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also trained the other women in the branch in first aid and nursing as well as related branch duties. She was on the executive committee for Cumann na mBan from 1915 to 1919. She was an organiser for the [[O'Donovan Rossa]] funeral, a mass demonstration arranged when the body of the [[Fenian]] was returned from America for burial. MacMahon was selected by [[Kathleen Clarke]] as one of the women to deliver messages around Ireland for leading up to the [[Easter Rising]]. Once the Rising began MacMahon delivered the mobilisation orders to the Cumann section leaders and also delivered guns, both hidden in her bicycle basket. She continued to act as courier throughout the Rising, moving between garrisons, such as the [[Four Courts]], all week. She was estimated to have made more than 50 trips out of the [[General Post Office, Dublin#History|General Post Office]].&lt;ref name="irishexaminer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCoole2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Litton2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Litton|title=Thomas Clarke: 16Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kziPAwAAQBAJ|date=2 May 2014|publisher=O'Brien Press|isbn=978-1-84717-654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Rising==
After the Rising she assisted Clarke with the Irish Volunteer Dependants’ Fund, running it when Clarke had to take time off due to a miscarriage, postponing her own marriage to Tom Rogers to do it. She was very involved in the work and finances of the fund&lt;ref name="irishexaminer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCoole2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sinead McCoole|title=Easter Widows|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47iUAwAAQBAJ|date=9 October 2014|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4481-7103-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pašeta2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Senia Pašeta|title=Irish Nationalist Women, 1900–1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNhGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202|date=5 December 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-72979-7|pages=202–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrow-HowellSherraden2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy Morrow-Howell|author2=Margaret Sherraden|title=Financial Capability and Asset Holding in Later Life: A Life Course Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wY5tAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71|date=29 December 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-165126-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then she began working directly for [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. On his instructions she resigned from Cumann na mBan when they announced they were Anti-Treaty.&lt;ref name="irishexaminer"/&gt; MacMahon did not publicly support either side during the civil war. Her public political activities ended on 6 December 1921. However she continued to work for Collins and hold papers for him until his death in 1922. Collins was aware that his activities would put people working for him in danger so he was concerned. MacMahon had married and moved when she did which added to her safety.

[[File:Mussolini spada islam.jpg|thumb|Mussolini with the Sword of Islam]]

The '''Sword of Islam''' ({{lang-ar|سيف الإسلام|Sayf al-Islām}}) was a ceremonial melee weapon given in 1937 to [[Benito Mussolini]], who was pronounced as the ''Protector of Islam'' ({{lang-ar|حامي الإسلام|Hāmī al-Islām}}).

==History==

In 1934, after the creation of [[Italian Libya]], Mussolini adopted a policy for encouraging comparisons with Islam, calling the local population "Italian Muslims of the fourth shore of Italy", building or restoring mosques and Koranic schools, preparing service facilities for the pilgrims going to [[Mecca]] and even making a High School of Islamic Culture in Tripoli. Behind the apparent humanitarian intent, [[fascists]] and some sectors of the Islamic world were recognizing [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as common enemies and Mussolini wanted to exploit this to his advantage.&lt;ref name=rapporti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arab.it/vari/fascismo.htm|title=I rapporti tra il fascismo e il mondo arabo-islamico|access-date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Randazzo|2008|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; These common interests were generated from the aversion to the agreements of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919, dominated by the [[United States]], France, and the United Kingdom, which had neither fully satisfied the requests brought forth by Italy, nor the requests from this part of the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=rapporti/&gt; 

In order to earn the favor of the Arabs and to seal himself the alliance, Mussolini, although a signatory of the [[Lateran Treaty]] with the [[Holy See]], decided to have bestowed on him the title of ''Protector of Islam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ham|2007|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the interpretation of Mussolini, with the Italian government taking over the place of the [[Ottoman Libya|Ottomans in Libya]], such a title was up to him concerning law since, in some manner, he was heir of the authority of the caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lanna|Rossi|2003|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 1937, in the outskirts of [[Tripoli]], Mussolini received the Sword of Islam from Iusuf Kerisc, a leading Berber supporter of the Italian occupation against the Libyan resistance, during a lavish ceremony. After entering Tripoli among salutes of cannons and at the head of a rank of 2,600 cavalrymen, Mussolini reaffirmed his closeness to the Muslim population, guaranteeing "peace, justice, wellness and respect for the laws of the Prophet."&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediastudies.it/IMG/pdf/La_Spada_dell_Islam.pdf|title=La Spada dell'Islam|access-date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the approval from the media of the regime, the ceremony provoked hilarity among the Italian people because of its absurd and paradoxical connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cifarelli|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonini|1999|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the photographs of the event, depicting Mussolini on the saddle of a horse held by the halter by a [[Groom (profession)|groom]], in his official version was retouched and published deleting the groom, in order to make it appear that Mussolini was able to ride his own mount without anyone's help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediastudies.it/IMG/pdf/Propaganda_e_falsificazioni_fotografiche.pdf|title=Propaganda politica e falsificazioni fotografiche tra le due guerre mondiali|access-date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detail is often cited as one of the more typical examples of the ''art of falsification'' established in the totalitarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/12_luglio_05/la-rimozione-leghista-bossi-pg-battista_69e21476-c661-11e1-8ab7-67e552429064.shtml|title=La rimozione leghista. Bossi, chi era costui?|access-date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, a horse monument was inaugurated in the main square of the Libyan capital in honor of Mussolini. Its base read: "To Benito Mussolini, peacemaker of the people, redeemer of the land of Libya, the mindful population and exhibitions where the Sword of Islam flashed consecrate in the sign of the Lictor a loyalty that challenges the destiny."&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;

The sword, decorated in [[arabesque]], equipped with a double-edged straight blade and with a hilt and solid gold friezes, had been achieved from the art firm ''Picchiani e Barlacchi di Firenze'' on the order of Mussolini himself.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After 1937, it was no longer used and was guarded in a small glass reliquary at Rocca delle Caminate, summer residence of Mussolini. There were no more signs of the precious object after [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|July 25, 1943]], when Rocca delle Caminate was ravaged and plundered by anti-fascists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Romersa|1994|p=2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Jefferson Withers''' (1804 &amp;ndash; November 7, 1865) was an American politician from [[South Carolina]] who served in the [[Confederate States Congress]] during the [[American Civil War]].

== Biography ==
Withers was born in [[York County, South Carolina]], and served as a state court judge in 1846. He represented the state in the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] in 1861 and signed the [[Confederate States Constitution]]. Withers is also notable for the sexually explicit letters he wrote in 1826 to a college friend, future governor [[James Henry Hammond]], with whom Withers had a homosexual relationship.  The letters, which are housed among the Hammond Papers at the [[University of South Carolina|South Caroliniana Library]], were first published by researcher Martin Duberman in 1981, and are remarkable for being rare documentary evidence of same-sex relationships in the [[antebellum United States]].&lt;ref name=Duberman&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn-ySVOZaSQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Duberman, Martin Bauml.

Petersen.  New York:  Haworth Press, 1981.  {{ISBN|0-917724-27-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Withers died at Camden in [[Kershaw County, South Carolina]] and was interred at the Quaker Cemetery in the same city.

'''Tom O'Folliard''' (1858 – December 19, 1880) was the best friend of outlaw William Bonney, a.k.a. [[Billy the Kid]]. Both were members of the [[Lincoln County Regulators|Regulators]] during the [[Lincoln County War]]. After the war ended, they became cattle rustlers, forming the Bonney gang with fellow outlaws [[Dave Rudabaugh]] and [[Charlie Bowdre]].

O'Folliard, a [[Texas|Texan]], was a participant in the Lincoln County War and survived the famous Five-Day Battle in Lincoln during July 1878. He is said to have been wounded by a gunshot to the shoulder while escaping from the McSween residence, which had been set on fire, with Billy and three others.

==Death==
He was shot in the chest by sheriff [[Pat Garrett]] on December 19, 1880, at Fort Sumner, dying approximately 45 minutes later. He was interred at Old Fort Sumner Cemetery in a plot later shared by Bonney and [[Charlie Bowdre]].&lt;ref&gt;Utley, Robert M.  ''Billy the Kid: A Short and Violent Life.''  p. 195.  {{ISBN|0-8032-4553-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayals in the media==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
* O'Folliard was portrayed in the 1942 film [[Apache Trail (film)]] by [[William Lundigan]].
* In the 1954 film [[The Law vs. Billy the Kid]] O'Folliard was played by actor George Berkeley.
* O'Folliard was also portrayed in the 1958 film [[The Left Handed Gun]] by [[James Best]] alongside [[Paul Newman]]'s portrayal of [[Billy The Kid]].
* [[Christopher Mitchum]] portrays O'Folliard in ''[[Chisum]]'', in the film he is friends with Billy the Kid ([[Geoffrey Deuel]]).
* The Tom O'Folliard character also appeared in ''[[Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid]]'' (1973), played by screenwriter [[Rudy Wurlitzer]], although depicted inaccurately as middle-aged.
* O'Folliard was portrayed in the 1990 film [[Young Guns II]] by [[Balthazar Getty]] as a 14-year-old "tenderfoot" orphan from Pennsylvania who begs his way into Billy the Kid's gang. This was inaccurate, as O'Folliard was a Texan, never left the southwest and was in his late teens when he joined the Regulators.
* O'Folliard was not depicted in the original [[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]] film, although in real life he had been present for the majority of the events depicted in the movie and had been one of Billy the Kid's best friends since the two first met.

Wanda Nara (sister of the model and TV host [[Zaira Nara]]) debuted on stage as a second ''[[vedette (entertainer)|vedette]]'' in the summer theater season of 2005–2006 in the [[revue]] ''Humor en Custodia''. Wanda in the summer theater season of 2006–2007 was a ''vedette'' in the revue ''King Corona'' of [[Jorge Corona]]: however, Wanda left the revue after two months due to alleged abuse from the comedian and his wife.

Wanda in 2011 participated in ''Patinando 2011'', a contest she left to go to [[Italy]] with her husband ([[Maxi López]] at that time) and because of her pregnancy.
