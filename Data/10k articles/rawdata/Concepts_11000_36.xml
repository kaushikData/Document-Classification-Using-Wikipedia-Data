'''''Alternity''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[role-playing game]] (RPG) published by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] in [[1998 in games|1998]]. Following the acquisition of TSR by [[Wizards of the Coast]], the game was discontinued in 2000 as part of a broader rationalisation of TSR's business holdings, but it retains a small and devoted fanbase. Parts of ''Alternity'' as well as TSR's classic ''[[Star Frontiers]]'' game have been incorporated into the ''[[d20 Modern]]'' game, especially the ''[[d20 Future]]'' setting. The first campaign setting for the ''Alternity'' game, the ''Star*Drive'' setting, was introduced in 1998.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp| title=The History of TSR| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=2005-08-20| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_History.asp&amp;date=2008-10-04| archivedate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new game called ''Alternity'' is due in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sasquatchgamestudio.com/products/alternity/|title=Alternity – Sasquatch Game Studio|website=www.sasquatchgamestudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System==
Characters were created with a point-based system, and could be either humans, mutants, one of several alien species presented in the core books, or original aliens created by the GM. Classes were replaced by professions, which dictated what skills and abilities were cheaper for any given hero to get, though a few skills (in particular, [[psionics]]) were restricted to specific professions. 

Skills are classified into broad and speciality skills. Earning a specialty skill requires an associated broad skill, which requires a character to have sufficient associated ability points. Special skill is further classified into ranks, which affects the skill's scores. Skill scores are presented with the full score, half that score, and one-quarter that score. which represent the numbers needed to achieve Ordinary, Good, or Amazing successes in an action round respectively.

Unlike many other systems, actions are determined by a control die and situation
dice. When Gamemaster calls for a roll, player rolls 1 control die and 1 situation die. The control die is always a 20-sided die, while situation die can be a 0, 4, 6, 8, 12, 20-sided die, where 0-sided die means the action only depends on control die roll. Situation die can be plus die or a minus die, in which the value in the situation die is added to or subtracted from control die value. The total of the rolled numbers is checked against character's action, skill, feat, to indicate a success or a failure. Rolling low is always better for successfully completing an action. 

The type of situation die being used depends on the difficulty of the action. Difficulty is scaled in die types of -d20, -d12, -d8, -d6, -d4, +d0, +d4, +d6, +d8, +d12, +d20, +2d20, +3d20. A character's base situation die is +d4 for broad skill or feat check, +d0 for specialty skill or action check. A minus situation bonus means player uses a larger negative situation die set, while a plus situation penalty means a player uses a larger positive situation die set.

In an action round, a round is divided into 4 phases. Each phase relates to one of the degrees of success that are achievable on an action check: Amazing, Good, Ordinary, and Marginal, in order from the first phase to the last. A hero can attempt only 1 action per phase. Acting orders of characters are determined by a d20 die roll for all participants, which determines the earliest phase in which a character can act. All actions in a phase are considered to occur simultaneously, with the results of those actions being applied at the end of the phase. A character can act in as many phases as it has actions per round.

Depending on how far below the skill score the player rolled, there are 3 progressively better layers of success and 2 levels of failure. An action is determined using this same system, making the game very uniform. Only armor rolls and damage rolls did not use the d20.

Life points, called 'Durability', are categorized into Stun, Wound, Mortal. Stun damage can immobilize a character, but not life-threatening; wound damage can immobilize a character and inflicts 1 stun damage point for every 2 wound damage points received; mortal damage can kill a character, and inflicts 1 wound damage point for every 2 mortal damage points received. Durabilities can be repaired by healing, or:
*For Stun, ending a scene.
*For Wound, resting.
*For Mortal, use of the Medical Science–surgery skill.

Designed to be a generic rule set around which a campaign world could be built, it was not very heavily marketed and suffered from mediocre sales which, along with increased focus on the d20 system, led to the discontinuation of the game in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Much of the content of the ''Alternity'' game has been absorbed into the ''d20 Modern'' role-playing game. The ''Dark•Matter'' campaign is an entire ''d20 Modern'' expansion and ''Star Drive'' is part of the ''d20 Future'' expansion. The ''Gamma World'' campaign is an ''d20 Modern'' expansion by Sword &amp; Sorcery Studios (White Wolf).

===Dice mechanics===
''Alternity'' uses four, six, eight, twelve, and twenty-sided dice, but does not use the popular ten-sided die, perhaps to help distinguish it from the competing ''[[World of Darkness]]'' and the ''[[Trinity (role-playing game)|Trinity]]'' role-playing game, published by [[White Wolf Game Studio]].

The probability curve created by the addition or subtraction of a d20 and another die is shaped like a plateau, with two straight lines on both ends of the flat region. This is intermediate between the totally flat probability curve rolled by rolling a 20-sided die and the bell-shaped curve produced by die pool systems.

==Published products==
Several books were published under the ''Alternity'' banner as core products, accessories, or under specific campaign settings.

===Core products===
These products presented the basic rules and information about the ''Alternity'' system.
* '''Introductory Box Set''' – A box set including all the basic information for players and gamemasters to learn the ''Alternity'' rules.
* '''Player's Handbook''' – Included all the rules for players and player characters. Required to play.
* '''Gamemaster Guide''' – Included all the rules for gamemasters and session preparation. Required to play.
* '''Fast Play''' – An abbreviated form of the rules to ease players into the game.
* '''Campaign Kit''' – The kit included a [[gamemaster's screen]] and a booklet of record keeping forms.

===Accessories===
These products were not tied to any of the official campaign settings but could be used with them.
* '''Beyond Science: A Guide to FX''' – An exploration and reworking of the FX abilities (a sci-fi version of magic) in the corebook.
* '''Dataware''' – The guide to computers, hacking, and robotics.
* '''Mindwalking''' – The guide to psionics including revisions to the rules from the corebook.
* '''Starships''' – The guide to interstellar ships and travel.
* '''Tangents''' – This book explored the concept of parallel realities in the same vein as the 90s television show [[Sliders]].

===Campaign settings===
In addition to the general ''Alternity'' line of products, four campaign settings were published, each with their own books:
* ''[[Star*Drive]]'' – A space opera setting.
* ''[[Dark•Matter]]'' – A setting similar to [[The X-Files]] television show.
* ''[[Gamma World]]'' – An update to the classic post-apocalyptic [[Gamma World|game setting]].
* ''StarCraft Adventures'' – Based on the [[Starcraft|popular computer strategy game]] by [[Blizzard Entertainment]].  This setting used simplified "fast play" rules rather than the full ''Alternity'' rule set.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America''''' is a 1997 book by [[art critic]] [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]].

==Reception==
''[[BookList]]'' called ''American Visions'' a "sensational history of American art." and wrote "The contrast between the influence of nature and of the city on American art is the fulcrum of Hughes' entire narrative ..."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; and ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice Reviews]]'' stated "The book bears the stamp of the author's aesthetic sensibilities (which value works of art for their technical competence as well as visual and intellectual qualities), his critical acuity, and his accomplished writing."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/900642/Reviews |title=American visions : the epic history of art in America |website=www.buffalolib.org |publisher=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' gave a starred review and described it as an "eminently readable handbook on American art.", writing "His readings of three centuries of both art works and trends are lively, detailed, and persuasive (though perhaps a bit too harsh regarding recent art), and his ultimately pessimistic take is expressed with great clarity. A meaty and illuminating excavation, full of vigor and punch..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-hughes-6/american-visions-the-epic-history-of-an-in-amer/ |title=AMERICAN VISIONS: The Epic History of An in America |date=1 March 1997 |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] noted "this is no bland, dumbed-down survey intended to flatter its subject or its audience. Hughes writes with an aesthete's disdain for political posturing, a traditionalist's belief in the importance of technical skills (painters are frequently taken to task for their shoddy draftsmanship) and a pragmatist's contempt for mystagogical bunk.", found "his account of the contemporary scene is disappointingly brief." and concluded "This slashingly witty, briskly paced, ferociously opinionated tour of the American visual landscape is a book that even the most un-likeminded readers will love to hate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-679-42627-1 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America |date=31 March 1997 |website=www.publishersweekly.com |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New York Times]]'' review calls it a "witty and impassioned history of American art from its beginnings to the present day", "beautiful and essential", notes that "Mr. Hughes fortunately remains the critic throughout his historical canvassing, making distinctions and judgments without taking sides." and concludes "With it, Mr. Hughes has made American art safe for the receptive alien deep inside us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lee Siegel |date=27 April 1997 |title=A critic interprets American art as a perpetual beginning  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/reviews/970427.27siegelt.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Visions'' has also been reviewed by the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=30 October 1997 |title=Big Daddy |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v19/n21/linda-nochlin/big-daddy |journal=London Review of Books |publisher=LRB Limited |volume=19 |number=21 |pages=10,11 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Journal of American History]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1998 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America.

'''Appreciative Advising''' (AA) is a social-constructivist advising philosophy that provides a framework for optimizing advisor interactions with students in both individual and group settings.&lt;ref name="The Appreciative Advising Revolution"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bloom, Hutson, &amp; He|title=The Appreciative Advising Revolution|year=2008|publisher=Stipes|location=Urbana-Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heart and soul of appreciative advising is the organizational development theory of [[appreciative inquiry]] that was developed in 1979 by David Cooperrider at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. Appreciative advising also draws from the [[positive psychology]], [[Social constructivism|social constructivist theory]], and [[Rational choice theory|choice theory]] literature.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Appreciative Advising Logo.png|400px|right|alt=The official logo of Appreciative Advising.|The official logo of Appreciative Advising]] --&gt;

== History ==
Appreciative advising emerged from an article written by Jennifer L. Bloom and Nancy Archer Martin titled "Incorporating Appreciative Inquiry into Academic Advising" that appeared in the online academic advising journal at Penn State, ''The Mentor'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dus.psu.edu/mentor/ ''The Mentor'']&lt;/ref&gt; on August 29, 2002.  Subsequently, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) began implementing the concepts outlined in the article and began to demonstrate success in terms of student retention.  Bryant Hutson and Scott Amundsen at UNCG coined the term "appreciative advising". Bloom, Hutson, and He (2008) wrote the first book, titled ''The Appreciative Advising Revolution'', on the topic.  Institutions and academic advisors from throughout the country are now utilizing the appreciative advising approach to guide their advising programs and interactions with students.

In 2012, the University of South Carolina began offering an online Appreciative Advising course as well as a process for certifying appreciative advisers.  Building on the success of the Appreciative approach to academic advising, the movement has expanded to other areas, including teaching (appreciative college instruction), orientation, admissions, Greek life, and tutoring. This expansion of the principles of appreciative advising is now known as appreciative education.

== The core of appreciative advising ==

=== The six phases ===

:'''Disarm'''
:The Disarm phase involves making a positive first impression with students and allaying any fear or suspicion they might have of meeting with the advisor.
:'''Discover'''
:The Discover phase is spent continuing to build rapport with students and learning about their strengths, skills, and abilities through utilizing effective and positive open-ended questions that encourages narratives.
:'''Dream'''
:The Dream phase involves uncovering students' hopes and dreams for their futures.
:'''Design'''
:The Design phase is spent co-creating a plan to make their hopes and dreams come true.
:'''Deliver'''
:The Deliver phase is the implementation phase where students carry out their plan, and the advisor’s role is to support them as they encounter roadblocks.
:'''Don't Settle'''
:The Don't Settle phase involves challenging students to achieve their full potential and supporting them along their journey.&lt;ref name=Web&gt;{{cite web|title=The Six Phases of Appreciative Advising|url=http://AppreciativeAdvising.net|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appreciative advising certification==

===Professional certification===
The University of South Carolina's Office of Appreciative Education now offers a professional rating for academic advisers: Appreciative Advising Certification. Certified Appreciative Advisors are committed to a standard of excellence in the field of advising and optimizing their students' educational experiences. The certification process includes successful attendance of the Appreciative advising Institute or completion of the appreciative advising course, as well as completed advising rubrics, recommendations, a current CV, and personal advising theory.&lt;ref name=Certification&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Certification |url=http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_certification.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021409/http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_certification.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of certification===
*Advanced professional qualification &lt;ref name=Certification /&gt;
*Increased skills and knowledge
*Raised professional expectations
*Elevated advising experience for students

===Appreciative Advising Institute===
The Appreciative Advising Institute was first held in August 2011 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The 2012 Appreciative Advising Institute was held July 28–31 in Charleston, SC. The Institute is intentionally designed to teach participants the theoretical structure of appreciative advising and to provide skills training in implementing this framework. This conference is designed to provide ample opportunity for participants to extend theory to practice.  Participants learn how the six phases help both the advisor and advisee optimize their educational experiences. Participants are encouraged and given the opportunity to reflect on their own goals and dreams to optimize their own lives.&lt;ref name=AAI&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Appreciative Advising Institute |url=http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/Default.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021400/http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/Default.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appreciative Advising Course===
The Appreciative Advising Course is designed to be a community of learners (instructors included). There are opportunities for participants to interact with other community members each week. This is done via discussion board conversations, as well as optional live chat dialogues. Active participants greatly enhance their own learning experience as well as that of the community. This is an eight-week course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appreciative Advising Course |url=http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_course.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924212922/http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_course.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== More about UNCG's usage of appreciative advising ==

=== Academic recovery programming ===
When students feel academically discouraged, such as when they are on academic probation, they may need to be reminded of the strengths that led them to college in the first place.  Students in academic trouble also typically have a limited time in which to improve their status. Practically, it is quicker to correct this status by building on strengths, and maintaining a course load and engaging in academic and social behaviors that reflect these strengths, than it is to attempt to correct long-standing deficits.  The SAS 100 program at UNCG is a great example of this application. The course features the use of the Appreciative Advising Inventory as the basis for three mandatory advising sessions and the use of appreciative advising questions in weekly reflections and discussions.  All instructors are trained to use appreciative advising in their meetings with the students. After the appreciative approach was introduced, retention of SAS 100 students improved 18%. When control and treatment groups were compared, the treatment group achieved a statistically significant GPA gain of .73 (p=. 03) compared to the control group at .42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hutson, B.L. He, Y., Amundsen|title=Evaluating the impact of Appreciative Advising across higher education institutions: A multi-site evaluation (Poster Presentation at the annual meeting of the American Evaluation Association, Portland, OR.)|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal transfer advising ===
Appreciative advising is also particularly useful in internal transfer cases in which a student has realized that their current declared major may not be a good fit, but are struggling to identify a new major. Student Academic Services at UNCG has used appreciative advising to assist declared pre-nursing majors who have not met continuance requirements.  This began as a pilot program in the spring of 2005, and currently includes all pre-nursing majors who have a cumulative GPA that has been identified as not competitive by the School of Nursing.  The goal of the program is to help students explore their options, given that they are unlikely to be accepted into the School of Nursing.  Of the 145 students served by the program during the spring and fall semesters of 2005, 30% have changed their major, while an additional 43% continue to receive advising through Student Academic Services.  The mean GPA for participants has also improved dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutson|first=B.L|author2=Atwood, J.A.|title=Outcome evaluation to support freshman orientation program|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First-year Experience Program ===
UNCG's [[First-Year Experience]] program is called University Studies 101 (UNS 101), and uses a curriculum emphasizing appreciative advising. One stated aim of the program is to assist students in discovering their purposes, identifying their strengths, and aligning these newly discovered assets with plans for their future.  The activities, class discussions, and assignments used in the course guide students through the six appreciative advising stages. A comprehensive program evaluation which includes the tracking of academic outcomes and assessment of student attitudes and behaviors has evidenced the positive impact of the UNS 101 program (Hutson &amp; Atwood, 2005). For example, the freshman to sophomore retention rate of freshmen who completed UNS 101 in fall 2006 and returned for fall 2007 was 81.9%. This compares to a retention rate of 74.4% for freshmen who did not take the course. Meanwhile, the average first semester GPA for students who did not take the course was 2.49, while UNS 101 participants had an average first semester GPA of 2.72.

'''Appreciative inquiry''' ('''AI''') is a model that seeks to engage stakeholders in self-determined change. According to Bushe "AI revolutionized the field of organization development and was a precursor to the rise of positive organization studies and the strengths based movement in American management."&lt;ref&gt;Bushe, G.R. (2013) The appreciative inquiry model.  In E.H. Kessler, (ed.) Encyclopedia of Management Theory, (Volume 1, pp. 41-44), Sage Publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed at [[Case Western Reserve University]]'s department of [[organizational behavior]], starting with a 1987 article by [[David Cooperrider]] and Suresh Srivastva.  They felt that the overuse of "problem solving" hampered any kind of social improvement, and what was needed were new methods of inquiry that would help generate new ideas and models for how to organize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D. L.|author2=Srivastva, S.|year=1987|chapter=Appreciative inquiry in organizational life|editor1=Woodman, R. W.|editor2=Pasmore, W.A.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Research in Organizational Change And Development|volume=Vol. 1|pages=129–169|location=Stamford, CT|publisher=JAI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cooperrider and Srivastva took a social constructionist approach, arguing that organizations are created, maintained and changed by conversations, and claiming that methods of organizing were only limited by people's imaginations and the agreements among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D. L.|author2=Barrett, F.|author3=Srivastva, S.|year=1995|contribution=Social construction and appreciative inquiry: A journey in organizational theory|editor1=Hosking, D.|editor2=Dachler, P.|editor3=Gergen, K.|title=Management and Organization: Relational Alternatives to Individualism|pages=157–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Cooperrider and [[Diana Whitney]] published an article outlining the five principles of AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D.L. |author2=Whitney, D|year=2001|chapter=A positive revolution in change|editor1=Cooperrider, D. L.|editor2=Sorenson, P.|editor3=Whitney, D.|editor4=Yeager, T.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Appreciative Inquiry: An Emerging Direction for Organization Development|pages=9–29|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=Stipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cooperrider, Whitney and several of their colleagues became centrally involved using AI to mid-wife the creation of the United Religions Initiative, a global organization dedicated to promoting grassroots interfaith cooperation for peace, justice and healing. This early partnership between URI and AI is chronicled in Birth of a Global Community: Appreciative Inquiry in Action by Charles Gibbs and Sally Mahé.  AI was also used in the first (1999) and subsequent meetings of business leaders that created the UN's Global Compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/intro/commentFeb05.cfm|title=Current Commentary on AI and Positive Change|author=Cooperrider, David|work=AI Commons|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another of the early applications, Cooperrider and Whitney taught AI to employees of GTE (now part of Verizon) resulting in improvements in employees' support for GTE's business direction and. as a part of continuous process improvement generated both improvements in revenue collection and cost savings earning GTE an [[ASTD]] award for the best organisational change program in the US in 1997."&lt;ref name="Bushe 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bushe, G.R.|author2=Kassam, A.|year=2005|title=When is appreciative inquiry transformational?

On May 8, 2010, Suresh Srivastva died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/suresh-srviastva|title=Suresh Srviastva|work=The Taos Institute|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervase Bushe, a researcher on the topic, published a 2011 review of the model, including its processes, critiques, and evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bushe, G. R.|layurl=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AITC.pdf|chapter=Appreciative Inquiry: Theory and Critique|year=2011|editor1=Boje, D.|editor2=Burnes, B. |editor3=Hassard, J.|title=The Routledge Companion To Organizational Change |pages=87–103|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published a history of the model in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gervasebushe.ca/Foundations_AI.pdf|title = Foundations of Appreciative Inquiry|date = 2012|website = Bushe's website|publisher = Appreciative Practitioner|last = Bushe|first = Gervase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis and principles ==

According to Bushe, AI "advocates collective inquiry into the best of what is, in order to imagine what could be, followed by collective design of a desired future state that is compelling and thus, does not require the use of incentives, coercion or persuasion for planned change to occur."&lt;ref name="Bushe, G.R. 2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2013|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/the_AI_model.pdf|title=The Appreciative Inquiry Model|editor= Kessler, E.|work=The Encyclopedia of Management Theory|publisher= Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model is based on the assumption that the questions we ask will tend to focus our attention in a particular direction, that organizations evolve in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately ask.&lt;ref&gt;Cooperrider, D.L. &amp; Whitney, D (2005) A positive revolution in change: Appreciative inquiry. In Cooperrider, D. L. Sorenson, P., Yeager, T. &amp; Whitney, D. (eds.) Appreciative Inquiry: Foundations in Positive Organization Development (pp.9-33).  Champaign, IL: Stipes.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 80's most methods of assessing and evaluating a situation and then proposing solutions were based on a ''deficiency'' model, predominantly asking questions such as "What are the problems?", "What's wrong?" or "What needs to be fixed?".  Instead of asking "What's the problem?", others couched the question in terms of "challenges", which still focused on deficiency, on what needs to be fixed or solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/|title=The Appreciative Inquiry Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Appreciative Inquiry was the first serious managerial method to refocus attention on what works, the positive core, and on what people really care about.  Today, these ways of approaching organizational change are common&lt;ref&gt;Bushe, G.R. &amp; Marhsak, R.M. (2015) ''Dialogic Organization Development: The Theory and Practice of Organizational Transformation.''  Oakdland, CA: Berrett-Koehler.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five principles of AI are:&lt;ref name="Bushe, G.R. 2013" /&gt;
# The ''constructionist principle'' proposes that what we believe to be true determines what we do, and thought and action emerge from relationships.  Through the language and discourse of day to day interactions, people co-construct the organizations they inhabit.  The purpose of inquiry is to stimulate new ideas, stories and images that generate new possibilities for action.
# The ''principle of simultaneity'' proposes that as we inquire into human systems we change them and the seeds of change, the things people think and talk about, what they discover and learn, are implicit in the very first questions asked.  Questions are never neutral, they are fateful, and social systems move in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately discuss.
# The ''poetic principle'' proposes that organizational life is expressed in the stories people tell each other every day, and the story of the organization is constantly being co-authored.  The words and topics chosen for inquiry have an impact far beyond just the words themselves.  They invoke sentiments, understandings, and worlds of meaning. In all phases of the inquiry effort is put into using words that point to, enliven and inspire the best in people.
# The ''anticipatory principle'' posits that what we do today is guided by our image of the future.  Human systems are forever projecting ahead of themselves a horizon of expectation that brings the future powerfully into the present as a mobilizing agent. Appreciative inquiry uses artful creation of positive imagery on a collective basis to refashion anticipatory reality.
# The ''positive principle'' proposes that momentum and sustainable change requires positive affect and social bonding.  Sentiments like hope, excitement, inspiration, camaraderie and joy increase creativity, openness to new ideas and people, and cognitive flexibility.  They also promote the strong connections and relationships between people, particularly between groups in conflict, required for collective inquiry and change.

Some researchers believe that excessive focus on dysfunctions can actually cause them to become worse or fail to become better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wallis, Claudia|date=January 17, 2005|work=Time Magazine|title=The Science of Happiness|url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/TimeMagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711093607/http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/timemagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf|archivedate=July 11, 2006 |deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, AI argues, when all members of an organization are motivated to understand and value the most favourable features of its culture, it can make rapid improvements.&lt;ref name="new-paradigm.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://www.new-paradigm.co.uk/Appreciative.htm|work=New Paradigm|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength-based methods are used in the creation of organizational development strategy and implementation of organizational effectiveness tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mt-online.com/component/content/article/77-february2007/228-building-strength-based-organizations.html|title=Building Strength-Based Organizations|first=Scott|last=Franklin|date=February 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928205741/http://www.mt-online.com/component/content/article/77-february2007/228-building-strength-based-organizations.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011|deadurl=y|work=Maintenance Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''appreciative'' mode of inquiry often relies on interviews to qualitatively understand the organization's potential strengths by looking at an organization's experience and its potential; the objective is to elucidate the assets and personal motivations that are its strengths.

Bushe has argued that mainstream proponents of AI focus too much attention on "the positive" and not enough on the transformation that AI can bring about through generating new ideas and the will to act on them.&lt;ref name="Bushe 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2007|title=Appreciative inquiry is not (just) about the positive|journal=Organization Development Practitioner|volume=39|issue=4|pages=30–35|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AI_pos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AI_generativity.pdf|title=Generative process, generative outcome: The transformational potential of appreciative inquiry|last=|first=|work=Organizational Generativity: The Appreciative Inquiry Summit and a Scholarship of Transformation|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|year=2013|isbn=|series=Advances in Appreciative Inquiry|volume=4|location=Bingley, UK|pages=|via=|author=Bushe, G.R.|editor1=D.L. Cooperrider|editor2=D.P. Zandee|editor3=L.N. Godwin|editor4=M. Avital|editor5=B. Boland|pp=89–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2010 comparative study in a school district he found that even in cases where no change occurred participants were highly positive during the AI process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2010|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/comparative_case.pdf|title=A comparative case study of appreciative inquiries in one organization: Implications for practice|journal=Revista de Cercetare si Interventie Sociala / Review of Research and Social Intervention|series=Special Issue on Appreciative Inquiry|volume=29|pages=7–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What distinguished those sites that experienced transformational changes was the creation of new ideas that gave people new ways to address old problems.  He argues that for transformational change to occur, AI must address problems that concern people enough to want to change.  However, AI addresses them not through problem-solving, but through generative images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2013|title= Dialogic OD: A theory of practice|journal=Organization Development Practitioner, special issue on advances in Dialogic Organization Development|volume=45|issue=1|pages= 10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this is covered in a 90-minute discussion about AI, positivity and generativity by Bushe and Dr. Ron Fry of Case Western, at the 2012 World Appreciative Inquiry Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Webcast Plenary Session 6: Prof. Dr. Ronald Fry and Prof. Dr. Gervase Bushe|url=http://www.2012waic.com/webcast-plenary-session-6-prof-dr-ronald-fry-and-prof-dr-gervase-bushe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguishing features ==

The following table comes from the Cooperrider and Whitney (2001){{full|date=September 2018}} article and is used to describe some of the distinctions between AI and approaches to organizational development not based on what they call positive potential:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Case Western Reserve University|work=Appreciative Inquiry Commons|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/intro/whatisai.cfm|title=What is Appreciative Inquiry?|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appreciative inquiry attempts to use ways of asking questions and envisioning the future in order to foster positive relationships and build on the present potential of a given person, organization or situation.  The most common model utilizes a cycle of four processes, which focus on what it calls:
#''DISCOVER:'' The identification of organizational processes that work well.
#''DREAM:'' The envisioning of processes that would work well in the future.
#''DESIGN:'' Planning and prioritizing processes that would work well.
#''DESTINY'' (or ''DEPLOY''): The implementation (execution) of the proposed design.&lt;ref name="new-paradigm.co.uk"/&gt;

The aim is to build – or rebuild – organizations around what works, rather than trying to fix what doesn't. AI practitioners try to convey this approach as the opposite of problem solving.

==Implementing AI==

There are a variety of approaches to implementing appreciative inquiry, including mass-mobilised interviews and a large, diverse gathering called an Appreciative Inquiry Summit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.positivechange.org/downloads/AI_and_Spiritual_ResonanceV.Final.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These approaches involve bringing large, diverse groups of people together to study and build upon the ''best'' in an organization or community.

== Uses ==

AI is used in organizational development and as a [[Management consulting|consultancy]] tool in an attempt to bring about strategic change. It has been applied in businesses, health care bodies, social non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and government operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/join/easySubmit.cfm|title=Easy Submit: Do you have a story, document, tool, event to share?|work= AI Commons|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originating in the US, it is also used in the UK – for example in the  [[National Support Teams]] and around the world.  Since 2000, ''The AI Practitioner'', a quarterly publication, has described applications in a variety of settings around the world.

AI has various business applications and can effectively be used to elicit information from stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe15/76385b5e4767493f3d51224c721494b6ec10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Positivity is paired with a group consensus to envision and begin producing an optimistic future based on existing strengths and successes. As seen in [[Harbarian process modeling]], AI has been used in [[Business process modeling]] to elicit information about an organization's present state and desired future state.

In Vancouver, AI is being used by the [[Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education]]. The Center, which was founded by the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and [[Victor Chan]], is using AI to facilitate compassionate communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart-Mind Inquiry|work=Dalai Lama Center|url=http://dalailamacenter.org/programs/programs-development/appreciative-inquiry|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Book cover Beyond Freedom and Dignity.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' (1971), spent eighteen weeks on the ''New York Times'' Best-Seller list.]]

'''''Beyond Freedom and Dignity''''' is a 1971 book by American [[psychologist]] [[B. F. Skinner]].  Skinner argues that entrenched belief in [[free will]] and the moral [[autonomy]] of the individual (which Skinner referred to as "dignity") hinders the prospect of using scientific methods to modify behavior for the purpose of building a happier and better-organized society.

''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' may be summarized as an attempt to promote Skinner's philosophy of science, the technology of human behavior, his conception of determinism, and what Skinner calls "cultural engineering".

==Synopsis==
The book is organized into nine chapters.

===A Technology of Behavior===
In this chapter Skinner proposes that a technology of behavior is possible and that it can be used to help solve currently pressing human issues such as over-population and warfare. "Almost all major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be solved by physical and biological technology alone. What is needed is a technology of human behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity. page 24 Hardback edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom===
In this chapter Skinner offers a more precise definition of [[Freedom of will|freedom]], one that allows for his conception of [[determinism]], and speaks to the conventional notion of freedom. Skinner argues against "autonomous man".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner notes that the forces of Freedom and Dignity have led to many positive advances in the human condition, but may now be hindering the advance of a technology of human behavior: "[the literature of freedom and dignity] has been successful in reducing the aversive stimuli used in intentional control, but it has made the mistake of defining freedom in terms of states of mind or feelings..."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dignity===
Dignity is the process by which people are given credit for their actions,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity, p. 58 "We recognise a person's dignity or worth when we give him credit for what he has done"&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively punished for them under the notion of responsibility. Skinner's analysis rejects both as "dignity" &amp;ndash; a false notion of inner causality which removes both credit for action and blame for misdeeds, "the achievements for which a person himself is to be given credit seem to approach zero.".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner notes that credit is typically a function of the conspicuousness of control. We give less or no credit, or blame, to those who are overtly coached, compelled, prompted or otherwise not appearing to be producing actions spontaneously.

===Punishment===
Skinner saw punishment as the [[logical consequence]] of an unscientific analysis of behavior as well as the tradition of "freedom and dignity". Since individuals are seen to be making choices they are then able to be punished for those choices. Since Skinner denies the existence of free will, he therefore argued against punishment which he saw to be ineffective in controlling behavior.

===Alternatives to Punishment===
Skinner notes that the previous solutions to punishment are often not very useful and may create additional problems. Permissiveness, the metaphor of mid-wifery (or [[maieutics]]), "guidance", a dependence on things, "changing minds", all contain either problems or faulty assumptions about what is going on.&lt;ref&gt;"The fundamental mistake made by all those who choose weak methods of control is to assume that the balance of control is left to the individual, when in fact it is left to other conditions." p.99 - Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner argues that this misunderstanding of control championed by the defenders of freedom and dignity "encourage[s] the misuse of controlling practices and block progress towards a more effective technology of behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Values===
Skinner notes a 'prescientific' view of man allows for personal achievement. The 'scientific view' moves human action to be explained by species evolution and environmental history.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner speaks to feelings about what is right, as well as popular notions of "good". Skinner translates popular words and phrases around value issues into his view of contingencies of reinforcement. Skinner notes that even if the technology of behavior produces "goods" to improve human life, they expose environmental control, which is offensive to the "freedom and dignity" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;"A technology of behavior is available...but the defenders of freedom oppose its use." Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Evolution of a Culture===
Skinner suggests that cultural evolution is a way to describe the aggregate of (operant) behavior. A culture is a collection of behavior, or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner addresses "[[social Darwinism]]" and argues that as a justification of the subordination of other nations or of war competition with others is a small part of natural selection. A much more important part is competition with the physical environment itself.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.133&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner relates the idea of cultural evolution back to the question of values: whose values are to survive?

===The Design of a Culture===
Skinner notes that cultural design is not new, but is already existing and on-going.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity. . 145&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner notes that most discussions of current problems are dominated by metaphors, concerns for feelings and states of mind which do not illuminate possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.148&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner notes that [[behavior modification]] is ethically neutral &lt;ref&gt;p.150 "Such a technology is ethically neutral. It can be used by villain or saint." Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner notes that [[Utopia]]n speculations, like his novel ''[[Walden Two]]'' are a kind of cultural engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Although Skinner mentions Plato, Augustine and was presumably inspired by Bacon's Atlantic and does not explicitly mention Walden Two in this reference. p.153 Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.&lt;/ref&gt; He then devotes much of the rest of this chapter to addressing the criticisms and complaints against cultural engineering.

===What is Man?===
Skinner again addresses the notion of the individual, and discusses how aspects of a person's character could be assigned to environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.186 aggression, industry, attention are addressed specifically&lt;/ref&gt; He also covers cognition, problem solving, self-control and counters some arguments or possible misconceptions. Skinner notes that his analysis does not "leave an empty organism".&lt;ref&gt;"A great deal goes on inside the organism" Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity. p195&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner addresses the issue of mechanical models of human action, which are better addressed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Mecca Chiesa's Radical Behaviorism deals with the misunderstanding of Skinner's analysis as "mechanistic" in some detail&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner notes that, "The evolution of a culture is a gigantic effort in [[Self control|self-control]]." and ends with, "A scientific view of man offers exciting possibilities. We have not yet seen what man can make of man."

==''Walden Two''==
''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' is consistent with ''[[Walden Two]]'', a 1948 novel by Skinner, depicting a utopian community based on his ideas regarding behavior modification. In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' Skinner extends his argument for explicit cultural engineering of which ''Walden Two'' may be seen as an example.

==Criticisms==
[[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[Noam Chomsky]] criticized Skinner's methods and conclusions. Chomsky's 1971 essay "The Case Against B.F. Skinner" responded to ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', arguing against [[behaviorism]] and its claim to scientific status.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. The Case Against B.F.Skinner http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19711230.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Skinner's denial of human dignity, Chomsky said, "It would be absurd to conclude merely from the fact that freedom is limited, that “autonomous man” is an illusion (...) It would be hard to conceive of a more striking failure to comprehend even the rudiments of scientific thinking ".&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, The case against B.F. Skinner (1971) 17:11 The New York review of books December 30, 1971. See also Eric Folot, "Human Dignity (Part 1): Its Critics" http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2354171 and http://www.legavox.fr/blog/ethos/dignite-humaine-partie-detracteurs-12702.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics include [[Ayn Rand]], whose 1971 article "The Stimulus and the Response" is an extended attack on ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' and a commentary on the significance of its reception.

John Staddon criticized Skinner's contention that punishment is ineffective and free-will an unnecessary concept, arguing that "Punishment doesn't always abolish freedom -- and freedom is not just absence of punishment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/5124 Staddon, J. (1995) "On responsibility and punishment" in ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Feb., 88-94.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14213">{{About|chain reactions in chemistry and physics}}
A '''chain reaction''' is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or by-product causes additional reactions to take place. In a chain reaction, [[positive feedback]] leads to a self-amplifying [[chain of events]].

Chain reactions are one way that systems which are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] can release energy or increase entropy in order to reach a state of higher entropy. For example, a system may not be able to reach a lower energy state by releasing energy into the environment, because it is hindered or prevented in some way from taking the path that will result in the energy release. If a reaction results in a small energy release making way for more energy releases in an expanding chain, then the system will typically collapse explosively until much or all of the stored energy has been released. 

A macroscopic metaphor for chain reactions is thus a snowball causing a larger snowball until finally an avalanche results ("[[snowball effect]]"). This is a result of stored gravitational potential energy seeking a path of release over friction. Chemically, the equivalent to a snow avalanche is a spark causing a forest fire. In nuclear physics, a single stray neutron can result in a [[prompt critical]] event, which may finally be energetic enough for a nuclear reactor meltdown or (in a bomb) a nuclear explosion.

Numerous chain reactions can be represented by a [[mathematical model]] based on [[Markov chain]]s.

==Chemical chain reactions==
=== History ===
In 1913, the German chemist [[Max Bodenstein]] first put forth the idea of [[chemical]] chain reactions. If two molecules react, not only molecules of the final reaction products are formed, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the parent molecules with a far larger probability than the initial reactants (In the new reaction, further unstable molecules are formed besides the stable products, and so on ..).

In 1918, [[Walther Nernst]] proposed that the [[photochemistry|photochemical]] reaction between [[hydrogen]] and [[chlorine]] is a chain reaction in order to explain what's known as the ''[[quantum yield]]'' phenomena. This means that one [[photon]] of light is responsible for the formation of as many as 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; molecules of the product [[HCl]]. Nernst suggested that the photon dissociates a Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule into two Cl atoms which each initiate a long chain of reaction steps forming HCl.&lt;ref name=Laidler288&gt;Laidler K.J., ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987) p.288-290  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Danish and Dutch scientists [[Christian Christiansen]] and [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers]], in an analysis of the formation of polymers, pointed out that such a chain reaction need not start with a molecule excited by light, but could also start with two molecules colliding violently due to thermal energy as previously proposed for initiation of chemical reactions by [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|van' t Hoff]]. &lt;ref name=Nobel1956/&gt;

Christiansen and Kramers also noted that if, in one link of the reaction chain, two or more unstable [[molecules]] are produced, the reaction chain would branch and grow. The result is in fact an exponential growth, thus giving rise to explosive increases in reaction rates, and indeed to chemical explosions themselves. This was the first proposal for the mechanism of chemical explosions.

A quantitative chain chemical reaction theory was created later on by Soviet physicist [[Nikolay Semyonov]] in 1934. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marka-art.ru/catalogs/StampSeries.jsp?%26id%3D29264%26lang%3Den |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116032126/http://www.marka-art.ru/catalogs/StampSeries.jsp?&amp;id=29264&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2009-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Semyonov shared the Nobel Prize in 1956 with Sir [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood]], who independently developed many of the same quantitative concepts. &lt;ref name=Nobel1956&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/press.html History of the chemical chain reaction from 1913 to the Nobel work recognized in 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical steps===
The main types of steps in chain reaction are of the following types.&lt;ref name=Laidler288/&gt;
* [[Chain initiation|Initiation]] (formation of [[Active center (polymer science)|active particles]] or chain carriers, often [[free radical]]s, in either a thermal or a photochemical step)
* [[Chain propagation|Propagation]] (may comprise several elementary steps in a cycle, where the active particle through reaction forms another active particle which continues the reaction chain by entering the next elementary step). In effect the active particle serves as a catalyst for the overall reaction of the propagation cycle. Particular cases are:
:: * chain branching (a propagation step which forms more new active particles than enter the step);
:: * [[chain transfer]] (a propagation step in which the active particle is a growing [[polymer]] chain which reacts to form an inactive polymer whose growth is terminated and an active small particle (such as a radical), which may then react to form a new polymer chain).
* [[Chain termination|Termination]] (elementary step in which the active particle loses its activity; e. g. by [[Recombination (chemistry)|recombination]] of two free radicals).

The ''chain length'' is defined as the average number of times the propagation cycle is repeated, and equals the overall reaction rate divided by the initiation rate.&lt;ref name=Laidler288/&gt;

Some chain reactions have complex [[rate equation]]s with [[Order of reaction#Fractional order|fractional order]] or [[Order of reaction#Mixed order|mixed order]] kinetics.

=== Detailed example: the hydrogen-bromine reaction ===
The reaction H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 HBr proceeds by the following mechanism:&lt;ref name=Laidler291&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler K.J.]], ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987) p.291-4  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atkins&gt;P. Atkins and J. de Paula ''Physical Chemistry'' (8th ed., W.H. Freeman 2006), p.831  {{ISBN|0-7167-8759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Initiation 
: Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Br• (thermal) or Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + hν → 2 Br• (photochemical)
: each Br atom is a free radical, indicated by the symbol « • » representing an unpaired electron.

* Propagation (here a cycle of two steps)
: Br• + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HBr + H•
: H• + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HBr + Br•
: the sum of these two steps corresponds to the overall reaction H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 HBr, with [[catalysis]] by Br• which participates in the first step and is regenerated in the second step.

* Retardation (inhibition)
: H• + HBr → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br•
: this step is specific to this example, and corresponds to the first propagation step in reverse.

* Termination 2 Br• → Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: recombination of two radicals, corresponding in this example to initiation in reverse.

As can be explained using the [[Steady state (chemistry)|steady-state approximation]], the thermal  reaction has an initial rate of [[Order of reaction#Fractional order|fractional order]] (3/2), and a complete rate equation with a two-term denominator ([[Order of reaction#Mixed-order|mixed-order kinetics]]).&lt;ref name=Laidler291/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atkins/&gt;

===Further chemical examples===
*The reaction 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O provides an example of chain branching. The propagation is a sequence of two steps whose net effect is to replace an H atom by another H atom plus two OH radicals. This leads to an explosion under certain conditions of temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Laidler K.J., ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987) p.323-8  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**H + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → OH + O
**O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → OH + H
*In [[chain-growth polymerization]], the propagation step corresponds to the elongation of the growing [[polymer]] chain. Chain transfer corresponds to transfer of the activity from this growing chain, whose growth is terminated, to another molecule which may be a second growing polymer chain. For polymerization, the [[kinetic chain length]] defined above may differ from the [[degree of polymerization]] of the product macromolecule.
*[[Polymerase chain reaction]], a technique used in [[molecular biology]] to amplify (make many copies of) a piece of [[DNA]] by ''[[in vitro]]'' [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[DNA replication|replication]] using a [[DNA polymerase]].

==Nuclear chain reactions==
{{main|Nuclear chain reaction}}
A ''nuclear'' chain reaction was proposed by [[Leo Szilard]] in 1933, shortly after the neutron was discovered, yet more than five years before [[nuclear fission]] was first discovered. Szilárd knew of ''chemical'' chain reactions, and he had been reading about an energy-producing [[nuclear reaction]] involving high-energy protons bombarding lithium, demonstrated by [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]], in 1932. Now, Szilárd proposed to use neutrons theoretically produced from certain nuclear reactions in lighter isotopes, to induce further reactions in light isotopes that produced more neutrons. This would in theory produce a chain reaction at the level of the nucleus. He did not envision fission as one of these neutron-producing reactions, since this reaction was not known at the time. Experiments he proposed using [[beryllium]] and [[indium]] failed.

Later, after fission was discovered in 1938, Szilárd immediately realized the possibility of using neutron-induced fission as the particular nuclear reaction necessary to create a chain-reaction, so long as fission also produced neutrons. In 1939, with Enrico Fermi, Szilárd proved this neutron-multiplying reaction in uranium. In this reaction, a [[neutron]] plus a fissionable [[atom]] causes a fission resulting in a larger number of neutrons than the single one that was consumed in the initial reaction. Thus was born the practical [[nuclear chain reaction]] by the mechanism of neutron-induced nuclear fission.

Specifically, if one or more of the produced neutrons themselves interact with other fissionable nuclei, and these also undergo fission, then there is a possibility that the macroscopic overall fission reaction will not stop, but continue throughout the reaction material. This is then a self-propagating and thus self-sustaining chain reaction. This is the principle for [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[atomic bomb]]s.

Demonstration of a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was accomplished by [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, in the successful operation of [[Chicago Pile-1]], the first artificial nuclear reactor, in late 1942.

==Electron avalanche in gases==
An [[electron avalanche]] happens between two unconnected electrodes in a gas when an electric field exceeds a certain threshold. Random thermal collisions of gas atoms may result in a few free electrons and positively charged gas ions, in a process called [[impact ionization]]. Acceleration of these free electrons in a strong [[electric field]] causes them to gain energy, and when they impact other atoms, the energy causes release of new free electrons and ions (ionization), which fuels the same process. If this process happens faster than it is naturally quenched by ions recombining, the new ions multiply in successive cycles until the gas breaks down into a plasma and current flows freely in a discharge.

Electron avalanches are essential to the [[dielectric breakdown]] process within gases. The process can culminate in [[corona discharge]]s, [[Streamer discharge|streamer]]s, [[leader (spark)|leader]]s, or in a [[electric spark|spark]] or continuous [[electric arc]] that completely bridges the gap. The process may extend huge sparks — streamers in [[lightning]] discharges propagate by formation of electron avalanches created in the high potential gradient ahead of the streamers' advancing tips. Once begun, avalanches are often intensified by the creation of [[photoelectron]]s as a result of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the excited medium's atoms in the aft-tip region. The extremely high temperature of the resulting plasma cracks the surrounding gas molecules and the free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lab Note #106 ''Environmental Impact of Arc Suppression'' | author= | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/| accessdate = March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process can also be used to detect radiation that initiates the process, as the passage of a single particles can be amplified to large discharges. This is the mechanism of a [[Geiger counter]] and also the visualization possible with a [[spark chamber]] and other [[wire chamber]]s.

==Avalanche breakdown in semiconductors==
An [[avalanche breakdown]] process can happen in semiconductors, which in some ways conduct electricity analogously to a mildly ionized gas. Semiconductors rely on free electrons knocked out of the crystal by thermal vibration for conduction. Thus, unlike metals, semiconductors become better conductors the higher the temperature. This sets up conditions for the same type of positive feedback—heat from current flow causes temperature to rise, which increases charge carriers, lowering resistance, and causing more current to flow. This can continue to the point of complete breakdown of normal resistance at a semiconductor junction, and failure of the device (this may be temporary or permanent depending on whether there is physical damage to the crystal). Certain devices, such as [[avalanche diode]]s, deliberately make use of the effect.

Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.

A region's climate is generated by the '''climate system''', which has five components: [[Earth's Atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[cryosphere]], [[lithosphere]], and [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name="IPCC glossary"&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexes.html AR4 SYR Synthesis Report Annexes].

The climate of a location is affected by its [[latitude]], [[terrain]], and [[altitude]], as well as nearby [[body of water|water bodies]] and their currents. Climates can be [[Climate classification|classified]] according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the [[Köppen climate classification]]. The Thornthwaite system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/210739|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/801/001/www/ET/Thornthwaite48-GeogrRev.pdf|author=C. W.

The Bergeron and [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]]s focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.

[[Paleoclimatology]] is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from [[Proxy (climate)|proxy variables]] that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in [[lake beds]] and [[ice core]]s, and biotic evidence such as [[Dendrochronology|tree rings]] and coral. [[Climate model]]s are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in [[global warming]]. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, "a 3{{formatnum:}}°C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological consequences of globalwarming: is the signal already|last=Hughes|first=Lesley|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=56|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIEE-20000201"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=Leslie |title=Biological consequences of global warming: is the signal already apparent? |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(99)01764-4 |date=1 February 2000 |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=56–61 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01764-4 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Climate (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''klima'', meaning ''inclination'') is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Climate|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1|accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard averaging period is 30&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages |title=Climate averages |accessdate=2008-05-17 |publisher=Met Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706025040/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/ |archivedate=2008-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but other periods may be used depending on the purpose. Climate also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|2001]] glossary definition is as follows:

{{quote|''Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather," or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30&amp;nbsp;years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

The [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) describes climate "normals" as "reference points used by climatologists to compare current climatological trends to that of the past or what is considered 'normal'. A Normal is defined as the arithmetic average of a climate element (e.g. temperature) over a 30-year period. A 30 year period is used, as it is long enough to filter out any interannual variation or anomalies, but also short enough to be able to show longer climatic trends."&lt;ref name="WMO data"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Data and Data Related Products |website=[[World Meteorological Organization]] |url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_data_and_products.php |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20141001233620/https%3A//www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_data_and_products.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WMO originated from the [[International Meteorological Organization]] which set up a technical commission for climatology in 1929. At its 1934 [[Wiesbaden]] meeting the technical commission designated the thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for climatological standard normals. In 1982 the WMO agreed to update climate normals, and these were subsequently completed on the basis of climate data from 1 January 1961 to 31 December 1990.&lt;ref name="WMO history"&gt;{{cite web | title=Commission For Climatology: Over Eighty Years of Service |year=2011 | publisher=World Meteorological Organization | url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/documents/WMO1079_web.pdf |format=pdf |pp=6, 8, 10, 21, 26 | accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate classification==
[[File:World Köppen Classification (with authors).svg|alt=Map of world dividing climate zones, largely influenced by latitude. The zones, going from the equator upward (and downward) are Tropical, Dry, Moderate, Continental and Polar. There are subzones within these zones.|thumb|right|upright=1.8|&lt;center&gt;Worldwide Koppen climate classifications&lt;/center&gt;]]
There are several ways to [[Climate classification|classify climates]] into similar regimes. Originally, [[clime]]s were defined in [[Ancient Greece]] to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into ''genetic'' methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and ''empiric'' methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the [[relative frequency]] of different [[air mass]] types or locations within [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] weather disturbances. Examples of [[empirical|empiric]] classifications include [[climate zone]]s defined by [[plant hardiness]],&lt;ref&gt;[[United States National Arboretum]]. [http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/691p3mE0Q?url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html |date=2012-07-09 }} Retrieved on 2008-03-09&lt;/ref&gt; evapotranspiration,&lt;ref name="thorn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Thornthwaite Moisture Index|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Thornthwaite&amp;submit=Search|accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally the [[Köppen climate classification]] which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain [[biome]]s. A common shortcoming of these [[classification scheme]]s is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.

===Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic===
{{Main|Air mass}}
The simplest classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nqQXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Bergeron+classification+is+most+widely+accepted+form+of+air+mass+classification#v=onepage&amp;q=Bergeron%20classification%20is%20most%20widely%20accepted%20form%20of%20air%20mass%20classification&amp;f=false|title=Field behavior of chemical, biological, and radiological agents|last=Army|first=United States Dept of the|date=1969|publisher=Dept. of Defense] Depts. of the Army and the Air Force|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its [[moisture]] properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for [[tropical]], P for [[Polar region|polar]], A for [[Arctic]] or Antarctic, M for [[monsoon]], E for [[Equatorial climate|equatorial]], and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate the stability of the [[atmosphere]]. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Airmass Classification|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=airmass-classification1|accessdate = 2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While air mass identification was originally used in [[weather forecasting]] during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.&lt;ref name=Schwartz1995&gt;{{cite journal|author = Schwartz, M.D.|year = 1995|title = Detecting Structural Climate Change: An Air Mass-Based Approach in the North Central United States, 1958–1992|journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume = 85|issue = 3|pages = 553–68|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01812.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based upon the Bergeron classification scheme is the [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]] (SSC). There are six categories within the SSC scheme: Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical), and Moist Tropical (similar to maritime tropical, maritime monsoon, or maritime equatorial).&lt;ref&gt;Robert E.

{{Main|Köppen climate classification}}

The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A) tropical, B) dry, C) mild mid-latitude, D) cold mid-latitude, and E) polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as [[rainforest]], [[monsoon]], [[tropical savanna]], [[humid subtropical]], [[humid continental]], [[oceanic climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[desert]], [[steppe]], [[subarctic climate]], [[tundra]], and [[polar ice cap]].

'''Rainforests''' are characterized by high [[rainfall]], with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between {{convert|1750|mm|in}} and {{convert|2000|mm|in}}. Mean monthly temperatures exceed {{convert|18|C|F}} during all months of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Woodward.

Climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Arctic Climatology and Meteorology.

In recent usage, especially in the context of [[environmental policy]], the term "climate change" often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the rise in average surface [[temperature]] known as [[global warming]]. In some cases, the term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the [[United Nations]] [[UNFCCC|Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses "climate variability" for non-human caused variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm |title=Glossary |work=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major [[ice age]]s. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by [[interglacial]] periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface [[albedo]], reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in [[greenhouse gas]]es, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the [[continent]]s, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois State Museum (2002).

They are used for a variety of purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.

The most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily [[carbon dioxide]] (see [[greenhouse gas]]). These models predict an upward trend in the [[surface temperature record|global mean surface temperature]], with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:
* Simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* this can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally
* finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] [[global climate model]]s discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Climateprediction.net.

Climate forecasting is used by some scientists to predict climate change. In 1997 the prediction division of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University began generating seasonal climate forecasts on a real-time basis. To produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_2476_580_1063_43/http%3B/iriportal3.ldeo.columbia.edu%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/development/climate_activities/prediction/climate_forecasts/climate_forecasts_overview__introduction/cf_intro_learn_more.html{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CoSMoS''' was a UK funded research project seeking to build capacity in generic modelling tools and simulation techniques for complex systems. Its acronym stands for Complex Systems Modelling and Simulation.
This was a four-year project, running from 2007 to 2011 as a collaboration between the [[University of York]] and [[University of Kent|Kent]], with further collaborations from the [[University of Abertay Dundee]] and [[Bristol Robotics Laboratory]].

== History ==
Collaboration between the universities of York and Kent started with the [http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/nature/tuna TUNA project], a feasibility study looking at the requirements for developing networks of [[nanite]]s that behave safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = TUNA - Theory Underpinning Nanotech Assemblers| url = http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/nature/tuna/| accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project involved researchers from York, Kent and Surrey. TUNA's outcomes were both conceptual and practical. An example of theoretical contribution consists of investigators showing that [[Emergence|emergent properties]] do not [[Refinement (computing)|refine]]

[[File:Antarctic expedition map (Amundsen - Scott)-en-crop.png|thumb|300px|alt= Map of a segment of Antarctica, identifying the polar marches of Scott and Amundsen.|The routes to the South Pole taken by Scott (green) and Amundsen (red), 1911–1912.]]

Between December 1911 and January 1912, both [[Roald Amundsen]] (leading his [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|South Pole expedition]]) and [[Robert Falcon Scott]] (leading the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]) reached the [[South Pole]] within a month of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the [[geographic south pole]] first and subsequently return to their base camp at [[Framheim]] without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.

== Overview ==
The outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.
*Priority at the South Pole: Amundsen beat Scott to the South Pole by 34 days.
*Fatalities: Scott lost five men including himself returning from the pole, out of a team of 65. Amundsen's entire team of 19 returned to Norway safely.
*Some authors (including Huntford and Fiennes) associate up to two further deaths (the drowning of Robert Brissenden and the suicide of [[Hjalmar Johansen]]) with the two expeditions, but these happened outside the Antarctic Circle.

Historically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed,&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; including:

* Priority at the pole: Scott wrote that Amundsen's dogs seriously threatened his own polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, would be able to start earlier in the season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, ponies, and motors.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's diary, 22 Feb 1911 "The proper, as well as wiser, course for us is to proceed exactly as though this had not happened. To go forward and do our best for the honour of the country without fear or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen's plan is a serious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60 miles— I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan for running them seems excellent. But above all he can start his journey early in the season—an impossible condition with ponies."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cherry Garrard in ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'' agreed but added that in his experience, dogs would not have been able to ascend the Beardmore Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry Garrard, ''The Worst Journey in the World'', chapter 19 "The practical man of the world has plenty of criticism of the way things were done. He says dogs should have been taken [to the Polar Plateau], but he does not show how they could have been got up and down the Beardmore [Glacier]."&lt;/ref&gt;
* With regards to the causes of the deaths of Scott and his companions, Cherry-Garrard devotes chapter 19 in his book to examine the causes. Among several other factors, he surmised that [[#Food and fuel|the rations of Scott's team were inadequate]] and did not provide enough energy for the men.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIX, page 573.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Much of Scott's hauling was to be done by ponies, which are ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes. Their relatively small hooves and large weight caused them to sink into anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow-shoes and had left most of them at base camp.
* Ponies' coats easily became soaked with [[perspiration]] during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast do not have sweat glands—they cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.
* The loss of ponies, several of which had drowned on disintegrating sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant [[Seal meat|seal]] and penguin meat found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores that had to be transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the pole.  
* Had the one-ton depot been placed at latitude 80°&amp;nbsp;S., as planned, Scott and his two surviving companions could have reached it on their return march. Instead, because Scott refused to drive the ponies to their deaths, despite Oates' urgent advice to do so, the depot was placed some 31&amp;nbsp;miles short of there. Scott's party died  11&amp;nbsp;miles south of the depot.
* The last-minute addition of Lieutenant Henry R. Bowers to the planned four-man pole party may have strained the rationing plan, although the death of Petty Officer Evans weeks later reduced the party to four again.
* The rations were deficient in B and C vitamins.&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite book|last= Preston|first= Diana|title= A First Rate Tragedy|publisher= Constable &amp; Co.|location= London|year= 1997|pages= 218–219|isbn= 0-09-479530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party became weaker a few weeks after reaching the pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [before Amundsen reaches the cablehead in Australia]. I wonder if we can do it."
* The tins of cooking fuel cached along the return route were found to be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to melt water likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had vaporised part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the cork stoppers. Amundsen knew about this "creep", and had had the fuel tins soldered shut on the voyage to Antarctica, see below.
* The weather on the return march seems to have been unusually bad. In particular, when the party reached the Great Ice Barrier, the temperature was much lower than expected for the season, making the surface much less suitable for the sledge runners. Furthermore, the tailwind which they had expected to aid them home did not appear. Scott wrote, in his final "Message to the Public": "...our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather...."
* The complexity of the transportation plan made it vulnerable. It depended in part on motor-sledges, ponies, dogs, and southerly winds to assist the sledges (which were fitted with sails). Half of the distance was intended to be covered by man-hauling (and sails whenever conditions permitted). Scott's daily marches were limited to the endurance of the slowest team, the man-haulers who were instructed to advance 15 miles a day. The ponies marched by night and rested when the sun was warmer, Meares remained idle in camp with the much faster dogs for many hours, before catching up at the end of the day.&lt;ref&gt;E.G.R.G. Evans South With Scott. Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; he states "Man is a poor [[pack animal|beast of burden]], as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves."&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

== Objectives of the expeditions ==
Scott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective ("The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition"&amp;nbsp;– Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole ("The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object"&amp;nbsp;– Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, [[Henry Robertson Bowers]], and [[Edward Adrian Wilson]] in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to [[Cherry-Garrard]].

Amundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under [[Kristian Prestrud]] who conducted an expedition to [[King Edward VII Land]] while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.

== Base camps ==
Amundsen camped on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] at the [[Bay of Whales]] which is 60&amp;nbsp;miles (96&amp;nbsp;km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350&amp;nbsp;miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott's base was at [[Cape Evans]] on [[Ross Island]], with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p153&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of transport ==
=== Motor sledges ===
The major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport&amp;nbsp;—dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three "motor sledges". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander [[Reginald William Skelton]]&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910"&gt;Letter to Capt Scott, R W Skelton, 7 April 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|E.R.G.R. "Teddy" Evans]] as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition.&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910" /&gt; Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to R W Skelton from Capt Scott, 21 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 17 Oct 1911, page 335 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ponies vs dogs ===
Scott had used dogs on his first ([[Discovery Expedition|Discovery]]) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

Scott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his [[Nimrod expedition]] that got to within {{convert|97.5|nmi|km mi}} of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the [[Beardmore Glacier]] (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, [[Lawrence Oates]], whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Susan|title=The Coldest March: Scott`s Fatal Antarctic Expedition|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300089678|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Coldest-March-Scott-s-Antarctic-Expedition/dp/0300089678/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764466&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|85}}

There was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of [[William Speirs Bruce]] in his Arctic, Antarctic, and [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], Amundsen in the ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition, [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s crossing of [[Greenland]], [[Robert Peary]]'s three attempts at the [[North Pole]], [[Eivind Astrup]]'s work supporting Peary, [[Frederick Cook]]'s discredited North Pole expedition, and [[Otto Sverdrup]]'s explorations of [[Ellesmere Island]]. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take "dogs, dogs and more dogs".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Sir Clements Markham from Fridtjof Nansen, 4 April 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murray | first = Carl | date = October 2008 | title = The use and abuse of dogs on Scott's and Amundsen's South Pole expeditions | journal = The Polar Record | publisher = Cambridge University Press | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–311 | issn = 0032-2474 | doi=10.1017/s0032247408007493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.'&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed "reluctance" to use dogs in this way: "One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions."&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

Amundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sullivan | first = Walter | year = 1962 | title = The South Pole Fifty Years After | url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3571/3546|journal = Arctic | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–178 | doi=10.14430/arctic3571}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = L G | title = The Logistics of the Polar Journeys of Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen | date = January 1972 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–47 | pmid = 4552519 | pmc=1644311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they "also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal".&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter XI, page 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

Amundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the [[Inuit]] while on his ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey,&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Olav Bjaaland, entry 12 November 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the [[Antarctic]] while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

=== Walking vs skiing on snow ===
Scott took the Norwegian [[pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] and [[skier]] [[Tryggve Gran]] to the [[Antarctic]] on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18&amp;nbsp;km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.

Scott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that "Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event".&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 11 Dec 1911, page 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, [[Olav Bjaaland]], as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the [[South Pole]].

== Weather conditions ==
Scott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. [[George Simpson (meteorologist)|Simpson]], Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|286}} The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer [[Edgar Evans]] and [[Lawrence Oates]] had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were {{Convert|11|mi|order=flip}} short of One-Ton Depot, which was {{Convert|140|mi|order=flip}} from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.

On the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly {{Convert|300|mi|4=-2|order=flip}} in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIII, dates 19 Feb to 15 Mar 1912, page 420–428.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also blamed "a prolonged blizzard". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a "normal" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|318-319}}

== Route marking and depot laying ==
During depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) {{Convert|180|mi|order=flip}} of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a {{Convert|6|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter X, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.

Scott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 25 and 26 Jan 1912, page 431 and entry 12 and 13 Feb 1912, page 443 as examples.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.

== Food and fuel ==
By the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 7 Dec 1911, page 381.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573" /&gt; A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the [[BBC]], confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Rees, Blizzard&amp;nbsp;– Race to the pole, BBC Books 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-563-49326-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.

Scott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Wilson]]'s trip with [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard|Cherry-Garrard]] and [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Bowers]] to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.

Since the rations contained no [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin C|C vitamins]], the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs.  This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

Scott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huntford|first1=Roland|title=The Last Place on Earth|date=1985|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd|location=London|isbn=0340381019|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Last-Place-Earth-Roland-Huntford/dp/0340381019/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764934&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|553}}

Dehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.

== Clothing and goggles ==
It has been said (by the present-day explorer [[Ranulph Fiennes]] amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.

Amundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.

Scott's team suffered regularly from [[snow blindness]] and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter X, entry for 10 Dec, page 367 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the "day" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the "night" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.

== Delay in meeting Scott's returning party ==
In 1921, [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|'Teddy' Evans]] wrote in his book ''South with Scott'' that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.{{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

{{quote
| About the first week of February I should like you to start your third journey to the South, the object being to hasten the return of the third Southern unit [the polar party] and give it a chance to catch the ship. The date of your departure must depend on news received from returning units, the extent of the depot of dog food you have been able to leave at One Ton Camp, the state of the dogs, etc&amp;nbsp;...It looks at present as though you should aim at meeting the returning party about March 1 in Latitude 82 or 82.30.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}}}}

He did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.

He continued his instructions in the next paragraph "You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, E.R.G.R. 1953 South With Scott London Collins p = 173&lt;/ref&gt; with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.

Expedition member [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book ''The Worst Journey in the World''. However, in the 1948 preface to his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gray |first = Richard | title = Scott of the Antarctic could have been saved if his orders had been followed, say scientists | date = 31 December 2012 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/robert-falcon-scott/9770678/Scott-of-the-Antarctic-could-have-been-saved-if-his-orders-had-been-followed-say-scientists.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and [[Edward L. Atkinson|Edward Atkinson]] reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}} Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler [[Cecil Meares]] had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote "In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February".

On 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at [[Hut Point]] when, on 19 February, [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]] arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|Edward Evans]] was lying seriously ill in a tent some {{Convert|35|mi|order=flip|round=5}} to the south, and in urgent need of rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Lashly, and Crean had formed the final Support Party which had left Scott on 3 January. Lashly had stayed on the Barrier to nurse Evans while Crean walked to Hut Point. Both were awarded Albert (lifesaving) medals&lt;/ref&gt;  Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.

Atkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]]. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to "use his judgement" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.

On the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes "We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt." By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble."

Around 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.){{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

== Other reasons for Scott's failure ==
; Geology samples
: Scott's team continued to haul over 14&amp;nbsp;kg (30&amp;nbsp;lb) of rock samples. This would appear to be a major handicap when pulling a sledge in a race against the weather and a shortage of food and fuel. Scott could have left the samples at one of the cairns along the way to be picked up later. However, Ranulph Fiennes has suggested that the extra weight would not have been a major handicap.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Scott, Ranulph Fiennes, {{ISBN|0-340-82697-5}}-page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tryggve Gran]] on the other hand thought "they might have saved themselves the bother".&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Tryggve Gran, entry 23 Nov 1912, quoted Last Place on Earth, Roland Huntford, {{ISBN|0-340-38101-9}}, page 556.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Final five-man team
: Scott's planning, equipment and rations had been based on three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 5 Jan 1912, page 414.&lt;/ref&gt; It also meant the Evans party of three had to try to split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360&amp;nbsp;miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.
; Misuse of the dog team
: For no clear reason Scott took the dogs on 140&amp;nbsp;miles further than originally planned. This meant killing the ponies early (and starting man-hauling earlier) to feed the dogs for no obvious benefit to the overall expedition. Scott also gave conflicting and changing orders for their use to each returning party. It was only in late February 1912 that it was discovered that the final supplies needed by Scott's returning party had not been delivered to One Ton Depot. Cherry-Garrard was sent with these supplies on 25 February 1912 and he was relieved to discover that he had beaten Scott's team to the depot.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428" /&gt; He also found that promised supplies of dog food were not in place. Cherry-Garrard remained at the depot, within {{Convert|100|km|4=-1}} of Scott, 4–10 March 1912 when he could possibly have saved Scott, Wilson, Bowers, and Oates if the management of the dog team had been better.

: Amundsen used prepared navigation sheets that simplified the calculations for his team when they were tired and cold. Four out of his team of five were qualified navigators. Amundsen's expedition also used a [[sextant]] during the journey, which is a relatively light and simple piece of equipment. He also attended a symposium that reviewed how to fix position at high latitudes. Scott used a [[theodolite]] which is heavier and requires more mental arithmetic.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|482}} Scott also lacked navigators having only one per team. Scott dismissed Cherry-Garrard's request for navigational training and Wilson only attempted to learn how to read latitudes at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|473, 538}}
; Camp routine
: Amundsen used canisters that left his sledges permanently lashed and loaded. Scott's team had to unload, and load and relash their sledge at every camp, no matter what the weather.

[[Image:Alembert.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean d'Alembert]] (1717—1783)]]
'''D'Alembert's principle''', also known as the '''Lagrange–d'Alembert principle''', is a statement of the fundamental [[classical physics|classical]] laws of motion. It is named after its discoverer, the [[France|French]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].  It is the dynamic analogue to the ''principle of [[virtual work]] for applied forces'' in a static system and in fact is  more general than [[Hamilton's principle]], avoiding restriction to [[holonomic system]]s.&lt;ref name=Lanczos&gt;{{cite book |last=Lanczos |first=Cornelius |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |edition=4th |year=1970 |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22d%27Alembert%27s+principle%22 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holonomic constraint depends only on the coordinates and time. It does not depend on the velocities. If the negative terms in accelerations are recognized as ''[[inertial force]]s'', the statement of d'Alembert's principle becomes ''The total virtual work of the impressed forces plus the inertial forces vanishes for reversible displacements''.&lt;ref name=Lanczos2&gt;{{cite book |title=p. 90 |author=Cornelius Lanczos   |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22d%27Alembert%27s+principle%22#PPA90,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle does not apply for irreversible displacements, such as sliding [[friction]], and more general specification of the irreversibility is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Udwadia | first1 = F. E. | last2 = Kalaba | first2 = R. E. | title = On the Foundations of Analytical Dynamics | journal = Intl. Journ. Nonlinear Mechanics | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 1079–1090 | date = 2002 | url = http://ae-www.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/On_foundation_of_analytical_dynamics.pdf | doi = 10.1016/S0020-7462(01)00033-6 | bibcode = 2002IJNLM..37.1079U | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100613031338/http://ae-www.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/On_foundation_of_analytical_dynamics.pdf | archivedate = 2010-06-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle states that the sum of the differences between the [[force]]s acting on a system of mass particles and the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system itself projected onto any [[virtual displacement]] consistent with the constraints of the system is zero. Thus, in symbols d'Alembert's principle is written as following,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where :

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; || is an integer used to indicate (via subscript) a variable corresponding to a particular particle in the system,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the total applied force (excluding constraint forces) on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt; m_i \scriptstyle&lt;/math&gt; || is the mass of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the acceleration of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || together as product represents the time derivative of the momentum of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle if the masses do not change with time, and
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the virtual displacement of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle, consistent with the constraints.
|}

This above equation is often called d'Alembert's principle, but it was first written in this variational form by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1956), ''Mechanics:  Lectures on Theoretical Physics'', Vol 1, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  D'Alembert's contribution was to demonstrate that in the totality of a dynamic system the forces of constraint vanish.  That is to say that the [[generalized forces]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf Q}_{j}&lt;/math&gt; need not include constraint forces.  It is equivalent to the somewhat more cumbersome [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]].

==General case with changing masses==
The general statement of d'Alembert's principle mentions "the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system". The momentum of the ''i''-th mass is the product of its mass and velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_i = m_i \mathbf v_i&lt;/math&gt;

and its time derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i + m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In many applications, the masses are constant and this equation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i = m_i \mathbf{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;,

which appears in the formula given above. However, some applications involve changing masses (for example, chains being rolled up or being unrolled) and in those cases both terms &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt; have to remain present, giving

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i - \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i)\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation for special cases==
To date, nobody has shown that D'Alembert's principle is equivalent to [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]]. D'Alembert's principle is a more general case .  And it is true only for some very special cases e.g. rigid body constraints.  However, an approximate solution to this problem does exist.&lt;ref name="Rebhan2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rebhan |first=Eckhard |title=Mechanik |series=Theoretische Physik |year=2006 |publisher=Spektrum Akademischer Verlag |location=Heidelberg, Germany  |isbn=978-3-8274-1716-9 |chapter=Exkurs 5.1: Ableitung des d'Alembert Prinzips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider Newton's law for a system of particles, i. The total force on each particle is&lt;ref name="Torby1984"&gt;{{cite book |last=Torby |first=Bruce |title=Advanced Dynamics for Engineers |series=HRW Series in Mechanical Engineering |year=1984 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |location=United States of America  |isbn=0-03-063366-4 |chapter=Energy Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} = m_i \mathbf {a}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)}&lt;/math&gt; || are the total forces acting on the system's particles,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf {a}_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || are the inertial forces that result from the total forces.
|}

Moving the inertial forces to the left gives an expression that can be considered to represent quasi-static equilibrium, but which is really just a small algebraic manipulation of Newton's law:&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} - m_i \mathbf {a}_i = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Considering the [[virtual work]], &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt;, done by the total and inertial forces together through an arbitrary virtual displacement, &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt;, of the system leads to a zero identity, since the forces involved sum to zero for each particle.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The original vector equation could be recovered by recognizing that the work expression must hold for arbitrary displacements. Separating the total forces into applied forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_i&lt;/math&gt;, and constraint forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C_i&lt;/math&gt;, yields&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i + \sum_{i} \mathbf {C}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If arbitrary virtual displacements are assumed to be in directions that are orthogonal to the constraint forces (which is not usually the case, so this derivation works only for special cases), the constraint forces do no work. Such displacements are said to be ''consistent'' with the constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title = Teaching Students Work and Virtual Work Method in Statics:A Guiding Strategy with Illustrative Examples|first = Ing-Chang|last = Jong|conference = 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference &amp; Exposition|year = 2005|url = http://search.asee.org/search/fetch?url=file%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2FE%3A%2Fsearch%2Fconference%2F29%2FAC%25202005Paper1212.pdf&amp;index=conference_papers&amp;space=129746797203605791716676178&amp;type=application%2Fpdf&amp;charset=|accessdate = June 24, 2014|section = Improving Mechanics of Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the formulation of ''d'Alembert's principle'', which states that the difference of applied forces and inertial forces for a dynamic system does no virtual work:.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is also a corresponding principle for static systems called the [[virtual work#Principle of virtual work for applied forces|principle of virtual work for applied forces]].

==D'Alembert's principle of inertial forces==
D'Alembert showed that one can transform an accelerating rigid body into an equivalent static system by adding the so-called "[[inertial force]]"  and "[[inertial torque]]" or moment. The inertial force must act through the center of mass and the inertial torque can act anywhere. The system can then be analyzed exactly as a static system subjected to this "inertial force and moment" and the external forces. The advantage is that, in the equivalent static system one can take moments about any point (not just the center of mass). This often leads to simpler calculations because any force (in turn) can be eliminated from the moment equations by choosing the appropriate point about which to apply the moment equation (sum of moments = zero). Even in the course of Fundamentals of Dynamics and Kinematics of machines, this principle helps in analyzing the forces that act on a link of a mechanism when it is in motion. In textbooks of engineering dynamics this is sometimes referred to as ''d'Alembert's principle''.

===Example for 1D motion of a rigid body===
[[File:Dalembert example.JPG|thumb|280x280px|Free body diagram of a wire pulling on a mass with weight W, showing the d’Alembert inertia “force” ma.
]]
To illustrate the concept of ''d'Alembert's principle'', let's use a simple model with a weight''' '''&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, suspended from a wire. The weight is subjected to a gravitational force, &lt;math&gt;W=mg&lt;/math&gt;, and a tension force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;''' '''in the wire. The mass accelerates upward with an acceleration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]] becomes &lt;math&gt;T-W=ma&lt;/math&gt;''''' '''''or &lt;math&gt;T=W+ma&lt;/math&gt;. As an observer with feet planted firmly on the ground, we see that the force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; accelerates the weight, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, but, if we are moving with the wire we don’t see the acceleration, we feel it. The tension in the wire seems to counteract an acceleration “force” &lt;math&gt;ma&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(W/g)a&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Rigid Body in Free Fall with Angular Velocity.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Free body diagram depicting an inertia moment and an inertia force on a rigid body in free fall with an angular velocity.]]

===Example for plane 2D motion of a rigid body===
For a planar rigid body, moving in the plane of the body (the ''x''–''y'' plane), and subjected to forces and torques causing rotation only in this plane, the inertial force is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_i = - m\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_c&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of the centre of mass of the body, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body. The inertial torque (or moment) is

:&lt;math&gt;T_i = -I\ddot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body. If, in addition to the external forces and torques acting on the body, the inertia force acting through the center of mass is added and the inertial torque is added (acting around the centre of mass is as good as anywhere) the system is equivalent to one in static equilibrium. Thus the equations of static equilibrium

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum F_x &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum F_y &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum T &amp;= 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

hold. The important thing is that &lt;math&gt;\sum T&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of torques (or moments, including the inertial moment and the moment of the inertial force) taken about ''any'' point. The direct application of Newton's laws requires that the angular acceleration equation be applied ''only'' about the center of mass.

===Dynamic equilibrium===
D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work states that a system of rigid bodies is in dynamic equilibrium when the virtual work of the sum of the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero for any virtual displacement of the system.  Thus, dynamic equilibrium of a system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates requires that is to be
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = (Q_1 + Q^*_1)\delta q_1 + \ldots + (Q_m + Q^*_m)\delta q_m = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
for any set of virtual displacements δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.  This condition yields m equations,
:&lt;math&gt; Q_j + Q^*_j = 0, \quad j=1, \ldots, m,&lt;/math&gt;
which can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} -\frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} = Q_j, \quad j=1,\ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;
The result is a set of m equations of motion that define the dynamics of the rigid body system.

'''''Dedovshchina''''' ({{lang-rus|дедовщи́на|p=dʲɪdɐˈfɕːinə}}; lit. ''reign of grandfathers'') is the informal practice of initiation ([[hazing]]) and constant [[bullying]] of junior [[Military recruitment|conscripts]] during their service, formerly to the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and today to the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian armed forces]], [[Internal Troops]], and (to a much lesser extent) [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] [[Border Guard Service of Russia|Border Guards]], as well as the military forces of certain [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Republics]]. It consists of brutalization by more senior conscripts serving their last year of compulsory military service as well as [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]].

''Dedovshchina'' encompasses a variety of subordinating or humiliating activities undertaken by the junior ranks: from doing the chores of the senior ranks to violent and sometimes lethal [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]], not unlike an extremely vicious form of [[bullying]] or even [[torture]], including sexual torture and rape (cases of forcingly stucking bottles of glass or metal objects inside of one's anus are common). When not leaving army seriously injured, conscripts can suffer serious psychopathology for their life time. It is often cited as a major source of poor [[morale]] in the ranks.

Often with the justification of maintaining authority, physical violence or psychological abuse can be used to make the “youth” do certain fatiguing duties. In many situations, hazing is in fact not the goal. Conscripts with seniority exploit their juniors to provide themselves with a more comfortable existence, and the violent aspects arise when juniors refuse to "follow traditions".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  There have been occasions where soldiers have been seriously injured, or, in extraordinary situations, killed.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from "''ded''" ({{lang-ru|дед}}, meaning grandfather), which is the [[Russian Army]] army slang equivalent of ''gramps'', meaning soldiers after their third (or fourth, which is also known as "dembel" ({{lang-ru|дембель}} or "DMB" ({{lang-ru|ДМБ}}) half-year of compulsory service, stemming from a vulgarization of the word "[[demobilization]]" ({{lang-ru|демобилизация}} ''demobilizatsiya'') - this word is erroneously used by soldiers to describe the act of resigning from the army); soldiers also refer to "dembel"  half-year of [[conscription]], with the suffix ''-shchina'' which denotes a type of order, rule, or regime (compare [[Yezhovshchina]], [[Zhdanovshchina]]). Thus it can literally be translated as "rule of the grandfathers." This is essentially a folk system of seniority based on stage of service, mostly not backed by code or law, which only grants seniority to conscripts promoted to various [[Sergeant]] and [[Gefreiter|Efreitor]] ranks.

==History==
The origin of this problem is often attributed to the change in conscription term brought about by the law of October 12, 1967, causing two different groups of [[Conscription|conscript]]s to be simultaneously present in the army: those who were drafted for 3-year service and those only for 2-year service.&lt;ref&gt;Those who date the present dedovschina system to 1967 include {{cite book |author= [[William Eldridge Odom|Odom, William E.]] |title= The Collapse of the Soviet Military |publisher= Yale University Press |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-300-07469-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, a decision was reached to draft conscripts with a criminal history into the ranks, due to a demographic crisis following [[World War II]].  While oppression by older conscripts has probably always taken place in the army, after that date, with the introduction of the four-class system (created by the [[Conscription_in_Russia#Late Soviet Union|bi-annual call-ups]]){{Clarify|date=May 2011}} it became systematic and developed its own rules and ranks.

==Current situation==
Many young men are killed or commit suicide every year because of ''dedovshchina''.&lt;ref name="dedov"&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2004/russia1004/6.htm The Consequences of Dedovshchina], [[Human Rights Watch]] report, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ismailov"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/51n/n51n-s11.shtml|title=Terrible dedovshchina in General Staff|first=Vjacheslav|last=Ismailov|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|language=Russian|date=2006-07-10|accessdate=2009-01-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that in 2006 at least 292 Russian soldiers were killed by ''dedovshchina'' (although the Russian military only admits that 16 soldiers were directly murdered by acts of ''dedovshchina'' and claims that the rest committed suicide).&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E7DF173EF930A2575BC0A9609C8B63|title=Hazing Trial Bares a Dark Side of Russia's Military | work=The New York Times | date=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' states: "On Aug. 4, it was announced by the chief military prosecutor that there had been 3,500 reports of abuse already this year (2006), compared with 2,798 in 2005". The BBC meanwhile reports that in 2007, 341 soldiers committed suicide, a 15% reduction on the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7425694.stm|title=Russia army suicides cause alarm|publisher=BBC News Online|date=29 May 2008|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia]] works to protect the rights of young soldiers.

In 2012, a draftee from [[Chelyabinsk]] region, Ruslan Aiderkhanov, was raped and tortured to death by his seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=21 Sep 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8779624/Russian-family-alleges-suicide-conscript-tortured-to-death.html |title=Russian family alleges 'suicide' conscript tortured to death |publisher=Telegraph |date=2011-09-21 |accessdate=2013-08-01 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one witness who was willing to testify against the alleged perpetrators, Danil Chalkin, was later found shot dead in his military base. A contract soldier, Alikbek Musabekov, was later arrested in this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newizv.ru/lenta/2012-02-13/159155-mladshij-serzhant-zastrelilsja-ne-vynesja-izdevatelstv-rjadovogo.html |script-title=ru:Младший сержант застрелился, не вынеся издевательств рядового  |work=[[Novye Izvestia]] |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2013-08-01|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government actions==
Overall, the state has done little to curtail ''dedovshchina''. In 2003, on the specific issues of denial of food and poor nutrition, Deputy Minister of Defense V. Isakov flatly denied the existence of such problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/russia1103/4.htm#_Toc55717189 |title=To Serve without Health? |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defense]] has published monthly statistics of incidents and crimes including cases of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.mil.ru/849/1048/1312/index.shtml Информация о происшествиях и преступлениях в Вооруженных Силах РФ], mil.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2007/08 the conscript service time was reduced from two years to one; dedovshchina primarily occurs when second year conscripts abuse first year conscripts, this measure is partially intended to curtail the practice.

==Dedovshchina in popular culture==
Several Soviet and Russian films portrayed the ''dedovshchina'' despite the military's abstention from helping the production. Following is the selected filmography:
*''[[Delay – raz! ("Delay – raz!: Do It - one!")|Do It - one!]] - Делай — раз!'' - 1990 
*''[[The Guard (1990 film)|The Guard]] - Караул'' - 1990
*''[[Afghan Breakdown]] - Афганский излом'' - 1990
*''[[100 Days Before the Command]] - Сто дней до приказа'' - 1990
*''[[:ru:Кислородный голод|Air Hunger]] - Кислородный голод'' - 1992
*''[[The Green Elephant]] - Зеленый слоник'' - 1999
*''[[Demobbed (2000 film)|Demobbed]] - ДМБ'' - 2000
*''[[The 9th Company]] - 9-я рота'' - 2005
*''[[The Search (2014 film)|The Search]] - 2014
Also, in the novel ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'', [[Tom Clancy]] writes that veteran Soviet naval captain [[Marko Ramius]] refused to allow ''dedovshchina'' to be practiced anywhere on his ship, dismissing it as "low-level terrorism".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2837">{{distinguish|detonation}}
'''Denotation''' is a translation of a sign to its [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]], precisely to its [[wikt:literal#Adjective|literal]] meaning, more or less like dictionaries try to define it. Denotation is sometimes contrasted to [[connotation]], which includes [[association (psychology)|associated]] meanings. The denotational meaning of a word  is perceived through visible concepts, whereas connotational meaning evokes sensible attitudes towards the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;https://tr.scribd.com/document/137895627/%D0%92-%D0%9D-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0&lt;/ref&gt;

==In semiotics==
{{main|denotation (semiotics)}}
In [[logic]], [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]], the denotation of a word or [[phrase]] is a part of its [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]; however, the part referred to varies by context:
* In [[grammar]] and [[literary theory]], the '''literal''' meaning or "dictionary definition" of a term, devoid of emotion, attitude, and color.
* In [[denotation (Semiotics)|semiotics]], the surface or literal meaning of a signifier.
* In logic, formal semantics and parts of linguistics, the [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] of a term.

==In other fields==
* In [[computer science]], [[denotational semantics]] is contrasted with [[operational semantics]].
*In [[media studies]] terminology, denotation is an example of the first level of analysis: what the audience can visually see on a page. Denotation often refers to something literal, and avoids being a [[metaphor]]. Here it is usually coupled with [[connotation]] which is the second level of analysis, being what the denotation represents.

==Examples==
{|
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony red rose.svg|left|100px|right|Example one.]]
The denotation of this example is a red rose with a green stem. The connotation is that it is a '''symbol''' of passion and love – this is what the rose represents.
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony cross.svg|100px|left|Example two.]]
The denotation is a brown cross. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of religion, according to the media connotation. However, to be more specific this is a '''symbol''' of Christianity.
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony heart.svg|100px|left|Example seven
.]]
The denotation is a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cartoon heart. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of love and affection.

'''Emanuel Rádl''' (December 21, 1873 &amp;ndash; May 12, 1942) was an original [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[biologist]], [[History of science|historian of science]], [[philosophy|philosopher]] and a critical supporter of [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|Masaryk´s]] pre-war democratic [[Czechoslovakia]]. He earned international renown by his works on the evolution of neural system and as historian of evolution theories.

== Life and thought ==
One of five children of a village merchant's family in [[Pyšely]] (35&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Prague]]), Rádl studied biology at [[Charles University]] in Prague, where he became assistant professor in 1904 and full professor in 1919. He worked on the [[neural system]] of [[insects]], on [[phototropism]] and on the evolution of [[visual perception|sight]]. Influenced by the German biologist and philosopher [[Hans Driesch]], he became interested in [[vitalism|philosophy of life]] and in a large work ''The History of Biological Theories'' (in German 1905&amp;ndash;1909, in English 1930; reprint in 1988) he criticized the [[evolutionism]] of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann&amp;ndash;Markoš (eds.). ''Emanuel Rádl''. Praha 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; At the book's climax at the end of Chapter 33, Rádl dismisses Darwinism with the words

{{quote|We may therefore sum up the modern position in Driesch's words: 'For those with insight Darwinism has been dead for a long time'... Darwinism as a tyrannic doctrine, which imperiously enchains the minds of men, is dead.|Rádl, ''The History of Biological Theories'', 1930. p. 388}}

Under the influence of Masaryk he inclined more and more towards philosophical questions, became a critic of scientific [[positivism]] and after the establishment of [[Czechoslovakia]] (1918) a public critic of several contemporary tendencies he considered dangerous. He wrote books on Czech and German [[nationalism]], on [[social justice]], on the fundamental differences between the West and the East and very early against the misuse of [[racial theories]] and against [[antisemitism]]. Together with the Protestant theologian J. L. Hromádka he co-founded the Czech Academic [[YMCA]] and published numerous booklets on various public topics. In 1934 he presided the 8th International Congress of Philosophy in Prague, but after 1935 he was gradually excluded from public life by a serious illness. He died in 1942 in Prague during the German occupation in almost complete isolation. His posthumous book ''Consolation from Philosophy'', in the oppressive mood of war, is a highly personal profession of faith in the lasting values of truth and religion and evoked a lively discussion after its publication in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Patočka]], ''Věčnost a dějinnost''. Praha 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"How to save our civilization from decay? This is the desperate question of our time, the more desperate that no one feels the danger."&lt;ref&gt;E. Rádl, ''Útěcha z filosofie''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5373">In [[abstract algebra]], an '''epigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] in which every element has a power that belongs to a [[subgroup]]. Formally, for all ''x'' in a semigroup ''S'', there exists a [[positive integer]] ''n'' and a [[subgroup]] ''G'' of ''S'' such that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &lt;/sup&gt; belongs to&amp;nbsp;''G''.

Epigroups are known by wide variety of other names, including '''quasi-periodic semigroup''', '''group-bound semigroup''', completely π-regular semigroup, '''strongly π-regular semigroup''' ('''sπr'''&lt;ref name="Renner2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lex E. Renner|title=Linear Algebraic Monoids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSEce2_LJ20C&amp;pg=PA27|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-24241-3|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Kelarev, ''Applications of epigroups to graded ring theory'', [[Semigroup Forum]], Volume 50, Number 1 (1995), 327–350 {{doi|10.1007/BF02573530}}&lt;/ref&gt; or just '''π-regular semigroup'''&lt;ref name="JespersOkninski2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Jespers|author2=Jan Okninski|title=Noetherian Semigroup Algebras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzj3MkWnCLQC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5809-7|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the latter is ambiguous).&lt;!--I've bolded those which seem most common--&gt;

More generally, in an arbitrary semigroup an element is called ''group-bound'' if it has a power that belongs to a subgroup.

Epigroups have applications to [[ring theory]]. Many of their properties are studied in this context.&lt;ref name="Kelarev2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrei V. Kelarev|title=Ring Constructions and Applications|year=2002|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-4745-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigroups were first studied by [[Douglas Munn]] in 1961, who called them ''pseudoinvertible''.&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Aleksandr Vasilʹevich Mikhalev and Günter Pilz|title=The Concise Handbook of Algebra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i2g2cstPDfEC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-7072-7|pages=23–26|author=Lev N. Shevrin|chapter=Epigroups}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
* Epigroups are a generalization of [[periodic semigroup]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus all [[finite semigroup]]s are also epigroups.
* The class of epigroups also contains all [[completely regular semigroup]]s and all [[completely 0-simple semigroups]].&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"/&gt;
* All epigroups are also [[eventually regular semigroup]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (also known as π-regular semigroups)

== Examples ==
* The semigroup of all matrices over a [[division ring]] is an epigroup.&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"/&gt;
* The multiplicative semigroup of every [[semisimple Artinian ring]] is an epigroup.&lt;ref name="Kelarev2002"/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Any [[algebraic semigroup]] is an epigroup.

== Structure ==
By analogy with periodic semigroups, an epigroup ''S'' is [[Partition of a set|partitioned]] in classes given by its [[idempotent]]s, which act as identities for each subgroup. For each idempotent ''e'' of ''S'', the set: &lt;math&gt; K_e= \{ x \in S\;|\; \exists n&gt;0:\; x^n \in G_e \} &lt;/math&gt; is called a ''unipotency class'' (whereas for periodic semigroups the usual name is torsion class.)&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"/&gt;

Subsemigroups of an epigroup need not be epigroups, but if they are, then they are called subepigroups. If an epigroup ''S'' has a partition in unipotent subepigroups (i.e. each containing a single idempotent), then this partition is unique, and its components are precisely the unipotency classes defined above; such an epigroup is called ''unipotently partionable''. However, not every epigroup has this property. A simple counterexample is the [[Brandt semigroup]] with five elements ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' because the unipotency class of its zero element is not a subsemigroup. ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is actually the quintessential epigroup which is not unipotently partionable. An epigroup is unipotently partionable [[iff]] it contains no subsemigroup that is an [[ideal extension]] of an unipotent epigroup by ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"/&gt;

'''Escalator etiquette''' is the [[etiquette]] of using [[escalator]]s. In many places, there is a [[convention (norm)|convention]] that people should stand on one particular side of an escalator to allow other people to walk on the other side.{{sfn|Geoghegan|2013}}

A 2015 experiment by [[Transport for London]] has suggested that such a convention sometimes reduces the efficiency of escalators: the number of people carried can increase if people stand on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/03/the-results-are-in-the-holborn-escalator-trial-proves-that-it-is-better-to-stand-on-the-escalator-well-sometimes/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Left or right==
The first escalators installed in the [[London Underground]] at [[Earl's Court station]] used the design patented by [[Charles Seeberger]].  These did not let the passengers dismount in the direction of travel, as currently.  Instead, a diagonal partition shunted them off to one side while the stairs disappeared under the partition.  The side chosen for disembarkation was the left hand side and this is the origin of their convention that riders should stand on the right, so that the walking riders would not have to cut into a standing line of people to exit.{{sfn|Malvern|2009}} Locations such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Belgium]] also follow this convention.

However certain countries, for instance Australia, Singapore, most of Japan, and New Zealand, riders stand on the left and walk on the right, following the road rules.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4670">The '''estimated time of arrival''' ('''ETA''') is the time when a [[ship]], [[vehicle]], [[aircraft]], [[cargo]], [[emergency service]] or [[person]] is expected to arrive at a certain place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cameron, M. |author2=Brown, A. |chapter=Intelligent transportation system Mayday becomes a reality |title=Aerospace and Electronics (NAECON 1995) |date=May 1995 |volume=1 |pages=340–347 |publisher=[[IEEE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Propp, Douglas A. |author2=Rosenberg, Craig A. |title=A comparison of prehospital estimated time of arrival and actual time of arrival to an emergency department |journal=[[The American Journal of Emergency Medicine]] |date=July 1991 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=301–303 |doi=10.1016/0735-6757(91)90045-L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
One of the more common uses of the phrase is in [[public transportation]] where the movements of [[train]]s, [[bus]]es, [[airplane]]s and the like can be used to generate estimated times of arrival depending on either a static [[Public transport or a private one timetable|timetable]] or through measurements on [[traffic]] intensity.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In this respect, the phrase or its abbreviation is often paired with its complement, '''estimated time of departure'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''ETD'''), to indicate the expected start time of a particular journey. This information is often conveyed to a [[passenger information system]] as part of the core functionality of [[intelligent transportation system]]s.

For example, a certain flight may have a calculated ETA based on the [[speed]] by which it has covered the [[distance]] traveled so far. The remaining distance is divided by the speed previously measured to roughly estimate the arrival time.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} This particular method does not take into account any unexpected events (such as new wind directions) which may occur on the way to the flight's destination.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

ETA is also used [[metaphor|metaphorically]] in situations where nothing actually moves physically, as in describing the time estimated for a certain task to complete (e.g. work undertaken by an individual; a computation undertaken by a [[computer program]]; or a process undertaken by an organization). The associated term is "estimated time of accomplishment", which may be a [[backronym]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Applications==
Accurate and timely estimations of times of arrival are important in several application areas:
*In [[air traffic control]] arrival sequencing and scheduling, where scheduling aircraft arrival according to the first-come-first-served order of ETA at the runway minimizes delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fast-time study of airline-influenced arrival sequencing and scheduling |author1=Carr, Gregory C. |author2=Erzberger, Heinz |author3=Neuman, Frank |journal=Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics |volume=23 |number=3 |pages=526–531 |date=June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control 2006 |url=https://www.aiaa.org/ProceedingsDetail.aspx?id=3844 |chapter=Target tracking and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) Prediction for Arrival Aircraft |author1=Roy, Kaushik |author2=Levy, Benjamin |author3=Tomlin, Claire J. |publisher=[[AIAA]] |id=AIAA2006-6324 |date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">An '''excitable medium''' is a [[nonlinear dynamical system]] which has the capacity to propagate a wave of some description, and which cannot support the passing of another wave until a certain amount of time has passed (known as the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory time]]).

A forest is an example of an excitable medium: if a [[wildfire]] burns through the forest, no fire can return to a burnt spot until the vegetation has gone through its refractory period and regrown.  In chemistry, [[oscillating reaction]]s are excitable media, for example the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] and the [[Briggs–Rauscher reaction]].  Pathological activities in the heart and brain can be modelled as excitable media.  A group of spectators at a sporting event are an excitable medium, as can be observed in a [[Audience wave|Mexican wave]] (so-called from its initial appearance in the 1986 [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] in [[Mexico]]).

==Modelling excitable media==

Excitable media can be modelled using both [[partial differential equation]]s and [[cellular automata]].

===With cellular automata===

Cellular automata provide a simple model to aid in the understanding of excitable media. Perhaps the simplest such model is in.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1978"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics|volume=54|year=1978|pages=515–523|title=Spatial Patterns for Discrete Models of Diffusion in Excitable Media|author=J. M. Greenberg |author2=S. P. Hastings|doi=10.1137/0134040|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton]] for this model. 
 
Each cell of the automaton is made to represent some section of the medium being modelled (for example, a patch of trees in a forest, or a segment of heart tissue).  Each cell can be in one of the three following states:

[[File:ExcitableCellularAutomaton.gif|thumb|right|220px|Traveling waves in a model of an excitable medium (White – Quiescent, Green – Excited, Yellow – Refractory)]]

* Quiescent or excitable — the cell is unexcited, but can be excited.  In the forest fire example, this corresponds to the trees being unburnt.
* Excited — the cell is excited.  The trees are on fire.
* Refractory — the cell has recently been excited and is temporarily not excitable.  This corresponds to a patch of land where the trees have burnt and the vegetation has yet to regrow.

As in all cellular automata, the state of a particular cell in the next time step depends on the state of the cells around it—its neighbours—at the current time.  In the forest fire example the simple rules given in [[Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton]] &lt;ref name="Greenberg1978" /&gt; might be modified as follows:

* If a cell is quiescent, then it remains quiescent unless one or more of its neighbours is excited.  In the forest fire example, this means a patch of land only burns if a neighbouring patch is on fire.
* If a cell is excited, it becomes refractory at the next iteration. After trees have finished burning, the patch of land is left barren.
* If a cell is refractory, then its remaining refractory period is lessened at the next period, until it reaches the end of the refractory period and becomes excitable once more. The trees regrow.

This function can be refined according to the particular medium.  For example, the effect of wind can be added to the model of the forest fire.

==Geometries of waves==

===One-dimensional waves===

It is most common for a one-dimensional medium to form a closed circuit, i.e. a ring.  For example, the [[Mexican wave]] can be modeled as a ring going around the stadium.  If the wave moves in one direction it will eventually return to where it started.  If, upon a wave's return to the origin, the original spot has gone through its refractory period, then the wave will propagate along the ring again (and will do so indefinitely).  If, however, the origin is still refractory upon the wave's return, the wave will be stopped.

In the Mexican wave, for example, if for some reason, the originators of the wave are still standing upon its return it will not continue.  If the originators have sat back down then the wave can, in theory, continue.

===Two-dimensional waves===

Several forms of waves can be observed in a two-dimensional medium.

A ''spreading wave'' will originate at a single point in the medium and spread outwards.  For example, a forest fire could start from a lightning strike at the centre of a forest and spread outwards.

A ''spiral wave'' will again originate at a single point, but will spread in a spiral circuit.  Spiral waves are believed to underlie phenomena such as [[tachycardia]] and [[fibrillation]].

Spiral waves constitute one of the mechanisms of fibrillation when they organize in long-lasting reentrant activities named rotors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">{{Utilitarianism}}
The '''felicific calculus''' is an [[algorithm]] formulated by [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748–1832) for calculating the degree or amount of [[pleasure]] that a specific action is likely to cause.  Bentham, an [[ethics|ethical]] [[hedonist]], believed the moral rightness or wrongness of an action to be a function of the amount of pleasure or pain that it produced.  The felicific calculus could, in principle at least, determine the moral status of any considered act.  The algorithm is also known as the '''utility calculus''', the '''hedonistic calculus''' and the '''hedonic calculus'''.

To be included in this calculation are several [[Variable (math)|variable]]s (or [[vector space|vector]]s), which Bentham called "circumstances". These are:
# Intensity&lt;!--Do NOT link this to [[Intensity]]!--&gt;: How strong is the pleasure?
# [[Time|Duration]]: How long will the pleasure last?
# [[Certainty]] or [[uncertainty]]: How likely or unlikely is it that the pleasure will occur?
# [[Propinquity]] or remoteness: How soon will the pleasure occur?
# [[Fecundity]]: The probability that the action will be followed by sensations of the same kind.
# [[wiktionary:Purity|Purity]]: The probability that it will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind.
# [[wikt:extent|Extent]]: How many people will be affected?

==Bentham's instructions==
To take an exact account of the general tendency of any act, by which the interests of a community are affected, proceed as follows. Begin with any one person of those whose interests seem most immediately to be affected by it: and take an account,
* Of the value of each distinguishable pleasure which appears to be produced by it in the first instance.
* Of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it in the first instance.
* Of the value of each pleasure which appears to be produced by it after the first. This constitutes the fecundity of the first pleasure and the impurity of the first pain.
* Of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it after the first. This constitutes the fecundity of the first pain, and the impurity of the first pleasure.
* Sum up all the values of all the pleasures on the one side, and those of all the pains on the other. The balance, if it be on the side of pleasure, will give the good tendency of the act upon the whole, with respect to the interests of that individual person; if on the side of pain, the bad tendency of it upon the whole.
* Take an account of the number of persons whose interests appear to be concerned; and repeat the above process with respect to each. Sum up the numbers expressive of the degrees of good tendency, which the act has, with respect to each individual, in regard to whom the tendency of it is good upon the whole. Do this again with respect to each individual, in regard to whom the tendency of it is bad upon the whole. Take the balance which if on the side of pleasure, will give the general good tendency of the act, with respect to the total number or community of individuals concerned; if on the side of pain, the general evil tendency, with respect to the same community.&lt;ref&gt;* Jeremy Bentham, ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', London, 1789&lt;/ref&gt;

To make his proposal easier to remember, Bentham devised what he called a "[[mnemonic]] [[doggerel]]" (also referred to as "memoriter verses"), which synthesized "the whole fabric of morals and legislation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intense, long, certain, speedy, fruitful, pure—&lt;br&gt;
Such marks in pleasures and in pains endure.&lt;br&gt;
Such pleasures seek if private be thy end:&lt;br&gt;
If it be public, wide let them extend&lt;br&gt;
Such pains avoid, whichever be thy view:&lt;br&gt;

==History==

Flood Brothers Disposal started operations with one truck and one employee, at 139 N. Clark St. in Chicago, Illinois. In 1963, the main center of operations moved to 5435 W. Chicago Ave. From 1970 to 1977, the company continued expansion and moved to several additional locations, eventually settling at 4827 W. Harrison St. in Chicago, where the company is presently based.

In 1988, the company expanded to include a fully automated recycling center, and in 1990, became the first licensed special waste hauler in the Chicago community. In 1996, Flood Brothers Disposal opened an additional facility in Carol Stream, Illinois. As of today, Flood Brothers Disposal services more than 150 communities in the Chicago area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Brothers History|url=http://floodbrothersdisposal.com/about-us/history/|work=Flood Brothers Disposal Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friendship bracelet diagram2.jpg|thumb|Step-by-step diagram of basic knot associated with friendship bracelets]]

A '''friendship bracelet''' is a decorative [[bracelet]] given by one person to another as a symbol of [[friendship]]. Friendship bracelets are often handmade, usually of [[embroidery floss]] or [[thread (yarn)|thread]] and are a type of  [[macrame]]. There are various styles and patterns, but most are based on the same simple [[half-hitch knot]].

The amount of thread used in bracelets varies depending on the pattern. The smallest pattern, a double chain knot, requires two strings while the candy stripe can have as 3 or more strings depending on the desired thickness.

Friendship bracelets first became popular in the [[United States]] during the 1970s. As they are unisex, they are commonly worn by both male and female [[Adolescence|teenagers]] and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchanan |first=Andrea J. |title=The Daring Book for Girls |year=2007 |publisher=Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-147257-3 |author2=Miriam Peskowitz |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now popular throughout the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Russell|title=Weekend: Mums on a mission|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lUBBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2agMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3899,4275950&amp;dq=friendship-bracelet&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Dirk|title=Despite rain, Denver is a mile high for the Pope|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aA0kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_tAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6544,3852443&amp;dq=friendship-bracelet&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News|date=August 13, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glascock|first=Stuart|title=Dalai Lama draws 65,000 in Seattle|url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/04/13/8251|newspaper=Common Dreams|date=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are not only popular among teenagers but among the older generation; they are popular among celebrities as well. Friendship bracelets can be worn on various occasions; for example, they are ideal as a fashion accessory at the beach because they are made of materials that will not be easily destroyed and with which one can swim freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Friendship Bracelets and Patterns |url=http://diamondsinstyle.com/blog/friendship-bracelet-patterns.html | work=diamondsinstyle.com |accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Friendship bracelets are ancient, but their resurgence is modern. The modern popularity of friendship bracelets started in the 1980s when they were seen during protests about the disappearances of [[Mayan people|Mayan]] Indians and peasants in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news|author=Julie Hatfield, Globe Staff|title= Bracelets that Make a Statement |newspaper= The Boston Globe |publisher= The New York Times Company|date= 1988|accessdate= August 27, 2012 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8063624.html Highbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship bracelets were brought into the United States by religious groups for use in political rallies.&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt; 

Friendship bracelets can have many meanings and symbolic uses, such as friendship, [[folk art]], or social statements.&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt; Although it is generally accepted that the origins of these colorful bands lie with the Indians in Central and South America, some decorative knots can be traced back to China from 481 to 221 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Braceletbook.com|url=http://www.braceletbook.com/history_of_friendship_bracelets.html|title=History of friendship bracelets}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, one ties a bracelet onto the wrist of a friend as a symbol of friendship and may wish for something at that moment. The bracelet should be worn until it is totally worn out and falls off by itself to honour the hard work and love put into making it. The moment at which the band falls off on its own, the wish is supposed to come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gryski |first=Camilla |author-link=Camilla Gryski |title=Friendship Bracelets |date= August 1993  |publisher=Mulberry Books |page=front inside cover |isbn=0688124372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misanga==
Misanga is an international good luck charm made from knotted [[Embroidery thread|embroidery floss]], [[thread (yarn)|thread]] or [[Gimp (thread)|gimp]]. Similar to friendship bracelets, it is made with basic knots as well as patterning techniques. Its basic structure is a three thread plaited braid. It is becoming a popular portable craft project.

[[File:Great Chain of Being 2.png|250 px|thumb|1579 drawing of the Great Chain of Being from [[:es:Diego de Valadés|Didacus Valades]], ''Rhetorica Christiana'']]

The '''Great Chain of Being''' is a strict hierarchical structure of all matter and life, thought in medieval [[Christianity]] to have been decreed by [[God]]. The chain starts with God and progresses downward to angels, demons (fallen/renegade angels), stars, moon, kings, princes, nobles, commoners, wild animals, domesticated animals, trees, other plants, precious stones, precious metals and other minerals.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

The Great Chain of Being ({{lang-la|scala naturae}}, "Ladder of Being") is a concept derived from [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] (in his ''[[Historia Animalium]]''), [[Plotinus]] and [[Proclus]]. Further developed during the Middle Ages, it reached full expression in early modern [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;"This idea of a great chain of being can be traced to Plato's division of the world into the Forms, which are full beings, and sensible things, which are imitations of the Forms and are both being and not being. Aristotle's teleology recognized a perfect being, and he also arranges all animals by a single natural scale according to the degree of perfection of their souls. The idea of the great chain of being was fully developed in Neoplatonism and in the Middle Ages.", Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, p. 289 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Mahoney, "Lovejoy and the Hierarchy of Being", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' Vol. 48, No 2, pp. 211-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The Chain of Being is composed of a great number of hierarchical links, from the most basic and foundational elements up through the very highest perfection: [[God]].&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964p59/&gt;

God sits at the top of the chain, and beneath him sit the [[angel]]s, both existing wholly in ''[[spirit]]'' form. Earthly flesh is fallible and ever-changing, mutable. Spirit, however, is unchanging and permanent. This sense of permanence is crucial to understanding this conception of reality. It is generally impossible to change the position of an object in the hierarchy. (One exception might be in the realm of [[alchemy]], where alchemists attempted to transmute base elements, such as [[lead]], into higher elements, either [[silver]] or, more often, [[gold]]—the highest ''element''.)&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

In the natural order, earth (rock) is at the bottom of the chain; this [[Classical element|element]] possesses only the attribute of existence. Each link succeeding upward contains the positive attributes of the previous link and adds at least one other. Rocks possess only existence; the next link up is plants which possess life ''and'' existence. Animals add motion and appetite as well.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

Man is both mortal flesh, as those below him, and also spirit, as those above. In this dichotomy, the struggle between flesh and spirit becomes a moral one. The way of the spirit is higher, more noble; it brings one closer to God. The desires of the flesh move one away from God. The Christian fall of [[Lucifer]] is thought of as especially terrible, as angels are wholly spirit, yet Lucifer defied God (who is the ultimate perfection).&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

==Subdivisions==
[[File:Nine orders of angels.jpeg|thumb|[[Orthodox Christian]] icon of [[Christian angelology|nine orders of angels]]]]

Each link in the chain might be divided further into its component parts. In medieval secular society, for example, the king is at the top, succeeded by the aristocratic lords and the [[clergy]], and then the peasants below them.  Solidifying the king's position at the top of humanity's social order is the doctrine of the [[Divine Right of Kings]]. The implied permanent state of inequality became a source of popular grievance, and led eventually to political change as in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Censer, Jack R. Censer; Hunt, Lynn |title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSDNl6Ydq_oC&amp;pg=PA21 |year=2001 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=0-271-04013-0 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the family, the father is head of the household; below him, his wife; below her, their children.

Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' ranked the angels (c.f. [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]'s ranking of angels), and Christian culture conceives of angels in orders of [[archangels]], [[seraphim]], and [[cherubim]], among others.

Subdivisions are equally apparent among animals. At the top of the animals are wild beasts (such as lions), which were seen as superior as they defied training and domestication. Below them are domestic animals, further sub-divided so that useful animals (such as [[dog]]s and [[horse]]s) are higher than docile creatures (such as [[sheep]]). [[Bird]]s are also sub-divided, with [[eagle]]s above [[Columbidae|pigeons]], for example. [[Fish]] come below birds and are subdivided between actual fish and other sea creatures. Below them come [[insect]]s, with useful insects such as [[spider]]s and [[bee]]s and attractive creatures such as [[ladybird]]s and [[dragonflies]] at the top, and unpleasant insects such as [[fly|flies]] and [[beetle]]s at the bottom. At the very bottom of the animal sector are [[snake]]s, which are relegated to this position as punishment for the serpent's actions in the [[Garden of Eden]].

Below animals comes the division for plants, which is further subdivided. Trees are at the top, with useful trees such as oaks at the top, and the traditionally demonic [[Taxus baccata|yew tree]] at the bottom. Food-producing plants such as [[cereals]] and [[vegetables]] are further subdivided.

At the very bottom of the chain are [[minerals]]. At the top of this section are metals (further sub-divided, with [[gold]] at the top and [[lead]] at the bottom), followed by [[rock (geology)|rocks]] (with [[granite]] and [[marble]] at the top), [[soil]] (subdivided between nutrient-rich soil and low-quality types), [[sand]], grit, [[dust]], and dirt at the very bottom of the entire great chain.

The central concept of the Chain of Being is that everything imaginable fits in somewhere, giving order and meaning to the universe.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

== The Chain ==
[[File:Carlo Crivelli 007.jpg|thumb|upright|St Thomas Aquinas classified all beings by rank.]]

===God===
God is at the top of the chain and is also external to creation. God is believed to exist outside the physical limitations of time and space. He possessed the spiritual attributes of reason, love, and imagination, like all spiritual beings, but he alone possessed the divine attributes of [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], and [[omnipresence]]. God serves as the model of authority for the strongest, most virtuous, most excellent type of being within any category.

===Angelic beings===
{{further|Christian angelology}}

Angels were beings of pure spirit who had no physical bodies of their own. In order to affect the physical world, angels were thought to build temporary bodies for themselves out of particles of earthly elements.{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Medieval and Renaissance theologians believed angels to possess reason, love, imagination, and, like God, to stand outside the physical limitations of time.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They possessed sensory awareness unbound by physical organs, and they possessed language. They lacked, however, the divine attributes of omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence of God, and they simultaneously lacked the physical passions experienced by humans and animals. Depending upon the author, the class of angels was further subdivided into three, seven, nine, or ten ranks, variously known as triads, orders, or choirs. Each rank had greater power and responsibility than the entities below them. The most common classification is that of St. Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aquinas, Thomas | url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.pdf | title=Summa Theologica | authorlink=Thomas Aquinas |date= |origyear=1265–1274 | via=Christian Classics Ethereal Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Humanity===
[[File:Die Leiter des Auf- und Abstiegs.jpg|thumb|upright|The mediaeval ''scala naturae'' as a staircase, implying the [[orthogenesis|possibility of progress]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramon Lull]]'s ''Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind'', 1305]]

For [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] thinkers, humans occupied a unique position on the Chain of Being, straddling the world of spiritual beings and the world of physical creation. Humans were thought to possess divine powers such as reason, love, and imagination. Like angels, humans were spiritual beings, but unlike angels, human souls were "knotted" to a physical body. As such, they were subject to passions and physical sensations—pain, hunger, thirst, sexual desire—just like other animals lower on the Chain of Being. They also possessed the powers of reproduction unlike the minerals and rocks lowest on the Chain of Being. Humans had a particularly difficult position, balancing the divine and the animalistic parts of their nature. For instance, an angel is only capable of intellectual sin such as [[pride]] (as evidenced by [[Lucifer]]'s fall from heaven in [[Christian]] belief). Humans, however, were capable of both intellectual [[sin]] and physical sins such as [[lust]] and [[gluttony]] if they let their animal appetites overrule their divine reason. Humans also possessed sensory attributes: sight, touch, taste, hearing, and smell. Unlike angels, however, their sensory attributes were limited by physical organs (they could only know things discerned through the five senses). The highest-ranking human being was the [[king]].

===Animals===
[[File:BonnetChain.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Bonnet]]'s chain of being from ''Traité d'insectologie'', 1745]]

Animals, like humans higher on the chain, were animated (capable of independent motion). They possessed physical appetites and sensory attributes, the number depending upon their position within the Chain of Being. They had limited intelligence and awareness of their surroundings. Unlike humans, they were thought to lack spiritual and mental attributes such as immortal souls and the ability to use logic and language. The primate of all animals (the "king of beasts") was variously thought to be either the lion or the elephant. However, each subgroup of animals also had its own primate, an avatar superior in qualities of its type.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

* Mammalian primate: [[lion]] or [[elephant]]
** Wild animals (large cats, etc.)
** "Useful" domesticated animals ([[horse]], [[dog]], etc.)
** "Tame" domesticated animals ([[housecat]], etc.)
* Avian primate: [[eagle]]
** Birds of prey ([[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, etc.)
** Carrion birds ([[vulture]]s, [[crow]]s)

Note that avian creatures, linked to the [[Classical element|element of air]], were considered superior to aquatic creatures linked to the element of water. Air naturally tended to rise and soar above the surface of water, and analogously, aerial creatures were placed higher in the chain.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The chart would continue to descend through various reptiles, amphibians, and insects. The higher up the chart one went, the more noble, mobile, strong, and intelligent the creature in Renaissance belief. At the very bottom of the animal section, we find sessile creatures like the [[oyster]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[barnacle]]s. Like the plants below them, these creatures lacked mobility, and were thought to lack various sensory organs such as sight and hearing. However, they were still considered superior to plants because they had tactile and gustatory senses (touch and taste).

===Plants===
Plants, like other living creatures, possessed the ability to grow in size and reproduce. However, they lacked mental attributes and possessed no sensory organs. Instead, their gifts included the ability to eat soil, air, and "heat." Plants did have greater tolerances for heat and cold, and immunity to the pain that afflicts most animals. At the very bottom of the botanical hierarchy, fungi and mosses, lacking leaf and blossom, were so limited in form that Renaissance thinkers thought them scarcely above the level of minerals. However, each plant was also thought to be gifted with various edible or medicinal virtues unique to its own type.

* Shrubs
* Bushes
* "Crops" (such as wheat)
* Herbs
* [[Fern]]s
* Weeds
* [[Moss]]es
* [[Fungus|Fungi]]

===Minerals===
Creations of the earth, the lowest of elements, all minerals lacked the plant's basic ability to grow and reproduce. They also lacked mental attributes and sensory organs found in beings higher on the chain. Their unique gifts, however, were typically their unusual solidity and strength. Many minerals, in fact, were thought to possess magical powers, particularly gems. The mineral primate is the diamond.

==Natural science==

===From Aristotle to Linnaeus===
[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|right|thumb|[[Linnaeus]]' [[biological classification|classification of animals]] with mammals ("Quadrupedia") first and worms ("[[Vermes]]") last, echoing the ''scala naturae'']]
{{further|Aristotle's biology#Classification}}

The basic idea of a ranking of the world's organisms goes back to [[Aristotle's biology]]. In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', where he ranked animals over plants based on their ability to move and sense, and graded the animals by their reproductive mode and possession of blood (he ranked all invertebrates as "bloodless").&lt;ref name="Singer, Charles 1931"&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology: A General Introduction to the Study of Living Things''. Oxford 1931.{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's non-religious concept of higher and lower organisms was taken up by [[natural philosophers]] during the [[scholasticism|Scholastic period]] to form the basis of the ''Scala Naturae''. The ''scala'' allowed for an ordering of beings, thus forming a basis for classification where each kind of mineral, plant and animal could be slotted into place. In medieval times, the great chain was seen as a God-given ordering: God at the top, dirt at the bottom, every grade of creature in its place. Just as rock never turns to flowers and worms never turn to lions, humans never turn to angels. This was not our lot in life. In the [[Northern Renaissance]], the scientific focus shifted to biology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The threefold division of the chain below humans formed the basis for [[Linnaeus]]'s ''[[Systema Naturæ]]'' from 1737, where he divided the physical components of the world into the three familiar [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of minerals, plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Linn1758" &gt;{{cite book |first=Carl |last=Linnaeus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |location=Stockholm |date=1758 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542 |language=Latin |edition=[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Scala naturae'' in evolution===

The set nature of species, and thus the absoluteness of creatures' places in the great chain, came into question during the 18th century. The dual nature of the chain, divided yet united, had always allowed for seeing creation as essentially one continuous whole, with the potential for overlap between the links.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt; Radical thinkers like [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] saw a progression of life forms from the simplest creatures striving towards complexity and perfection, a schema accepted by zoologists like [[Henri de Blainville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Appel |first=T.A. |title=Henri De Blainville and the Animal Series: A Nineteenth-Century Chain of Being |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1980 |volume=13 | issue = 2 |pages=291–319 |jstor=4330767 |doi=10.1007/BF00125745|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very idea of an ordering of organisms, even if supposedly fixed, laid the basis for the idea of [[transmutation of species]], for example [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;

The Chain of Being continued to be part of [[metaphysics]] in 19th century education, and the concept was well known. The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] used it as a metaphor in his 1851 ''Elements of Geology'' description of the [[Geologic time scale|geological column]], where he used the term "[[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing links]]" in relation to missing parts of the continuum. The term "missing link" later came to signify [[transitional fossil]]s, particularly those bridging the gulf between man and beasts.&lt;ref name="hm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoxfulmonsters.com/2009/06/why-the-term-missing-links-is-inappropriate/ |title=Why the term "missing links" is inappropriate |date=10 June 2009 |publisher=Hoxful Monsters |accessdate=10 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402093028/http://www.hoxfulmonsters.com/2009/06/why-the-term-missing-links-is-inappropriate/ |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

Allenby and Garreau propose the Catholic Church's narrative of the Great Chain of Being kept the peace for centuries in Europe.  The very concept of rebellion simply lay outside the reality within which most people lived for to defy the King was to defy God. King James I himself wrote, "The state of monarchy is the most supreme thing upon earth: for kings are not only God's Lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, but even by God himself they are called Gods."&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt;

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] broke this supposed divine plan and fought the last vestiges of feudal hierarchy by creating secular governmental structures that vested power into the hands of ordinary citizens rather than divinely ordained monarchs.&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://faculty.grandview.edu/ssnyder/121/121%20great%20chain.htm |title=The Great Chain of Being|website=faculty.grandview.edu |author=Snyder, S. |access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scholars such as Brian Tierney&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Reid.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Novak&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crisismagazine.com/1990/thomas-aquinas-the-first-whig-what-our-liberties-owe-to-a-neapolitan-mendicant&lt;/ref&gt; have noted the medieval contribution to democracy and human rights.

==Adaptations and similar concepts==
The American spiritual writer and philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] uses a concept called the "Great Nest of Being" which is similar to the Great Chain of Being, and which he claims to belong to a culture-independent "[[perennial philosophy]]" traceable across 3000 years of mystical and esoteric writings. Wilber's system corresponds with other concepts of [[transpersonal psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Freeman, Anthony |date=2006 |title=A Daniel Come to Judgement? Dennett and the Revisioning of Transpersonal Theory |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=95–109 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/13-3_Freeman.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68sTnOHBi?url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/13-3_Freeman.pdf |archivedate=July 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1977 book ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'', British philosopher and economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] wrote that fundamental gaps exist between the existence of minerals, plants, animals and humans, where each of the four classes of existence is marked by a level of existence not shared by that below. Clearly influenced by the great chain of being, but lacking the angels and God, he called his hierarchy the "levels of being". In the book, he claims that science has generally avoided seriously discussing these discontinuities, because they present such difficulties for strictly materialistic science, and they largely remain mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph (2008).

To be '''hanged, drawn and quartered''' was [[Treason Act 1351|from 1352]] a [[statutory]] penalty in England for men convicted of [[high treason]], although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216–1272). A convicted traitor was fastened to a [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then [[hanged]] (almost to the point of death), [[emasculation|emasculated]], [[disembowelment|disembowelled]], [[decapitation|beheaded]], and [[Dismemberment|quartered]] (chopped into four pieces). The traitor's remains were often displayed in prominent places across the country, such as [[London Bridge]].  For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]].

The severity of the sentence was [[Retributive justice|measured against the seriousness of the crime]]. As an attack on the monarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests executed during the [[Elizabethan era]], and several of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides involved in the 1649 execution of Charles I]].

Although the [[Act of Parliament]] defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England [[Forfeiture Act 1870|in 1870]]. The death penalty for treason was abolished [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998|in 1998]].

==Treason in England==
[[Image:Drawing of William de Marisco.jpg|right|thumb|300px|As illustrated in [[Matthew Paris]]'s ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', [[William de Marisco]] is drawn to his execution behind a horse.]]
During the [[High Middle Ages]] those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging.  In the 13th century other, more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering.  The 13th-century English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] described how in 1238 "a certain man at arms, a man of some education (''armiger literatus'')"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Powicke|1949|pp=54–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to kill [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].  His account records in gruesome detail how the would-be assassin was executed: "dragged asunder, then beheaded, and his body divided into three parts; each part was then dragged through one of the principal cities of England, and was afterwards hung on a gibbet used for robbers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Giles|1852|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|"''&lt;!-- Quo cognito --&gt;Rex eum, quasi regiae majestatis (occisorem), membratim laniatum equis apud Coventre, exemplum terribile et spectaculum comentabile praebere (iussit) omnibus audentibus talia machinari.  Primo enim distractus, postea decollatus et corpus in tres partes divisum est.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  He was apparently sent by [[William de Marisco]], an outlaw who some years earlier had killed a man under royal protection before fleeing to [[Lundy Island]].  De Marisco was captured in 1242 and on Henry's order dragged from Westminster to the [[Tower of London]] to be executed.  There he was hanged from a [[gibbet]] until dead.  His corpse was disembowelled, his entrails burned, his body quartered and the parts distributed to cities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|Paris|1987|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The punishment is more frequently recorded during [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diehl|Donnelly|2009|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Welsh people|Welshman]] [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] became the first nobleman in England to be hanged, drawn, and quartered after he turned against the king and proclaimed himself [[Prince of Wales]] and Lord of Snowdon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beadle|Harrison|2008|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dafydd's rebellion infuriated Edward so much that he demanded a novel punishment.  Therefore, following his capture and trial in 1283, for his betrayal he was drawn by horse to his place of execution.  For killing English nobles he was hanged alive.  For killing those nobles at Easter he was eviscerated and his entrails burned. For conspiring to kill the king in various parts of the realm, his body was quartered and the parts sent across the country; his head was placed on top of the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2004|pp=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar fate was suffered by the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] leader [[William Wallace|Sir William Wallace]].  Captured and tried in 1305,&lt;!-- this date not cited but uncontroversial, in fact it's in Bellamy 2004 p29 --&gt; he was forced to wear a crown of laurel leaves and was drawn to [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], where he was hanged and beheaded.  His entrails were then burned and his corpse quartered.  His head was set on [[London Bridge]] and the quarters sent to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]], [[Stirling]], and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murison|2003|pp=147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was enacted at a time in English history when a monarch's right to rule was indisputable and was therefore written principally to protect the throne and sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanner|1940|pp=375–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new law offered a narrower definition of treason than had existed before and split the old feudal offence into two classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubber|2005|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Petty treason]] referred to the killing of a master (or lord) by his servant, a husband by his wife, or a prelate by his clergyman.

[[High treason in the United Kingdom|High treason]] was the most egregious offence an individual could commit.  Attempts to undermine the king's authority were viewed with as much seriousness as if the accused had attacked him personally, which itself would be an assault on his status as sovereign and a direct threat to his right to govern.  As this might undermine the state, retribution was considered an absolute necessity and the crime deserving of the ultimate punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foucault|1995|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practical difference between the two offences therefore was in the consequence of being convicted; rather than being drawn and hanged, men were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, while for reasons of public decency (their anatomy being considered inappropriate for the sentence), women were instead drawn and burned.&lt;ref name="Briggsp84"&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|1996|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Naishp9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Naish|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act declared that a person had committed high treason if they were: compassing or imagining the death of the king, his wife or his eldest son and heir; violating the king's wife, his eldest daughter if she were unmarried, or the wife of his eldest son and heir; levying war against the king in his [[realm]]; adhering to the king's enemies in his realm, giving them aid and comfort in his realm or elsewhere; counterfeiting the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] or the [[Privy Seal]], or the king's coinage; knowingly importing counterfeit money; killing the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] or one of the king's Justices while performing their offices.&lt;ref name="Bellamyp9"/&gt;  The Act did not limit the king's authority in defining the scope of treason.  It contained a proviso giving English judges discretion to extend that scope whenever required, a process more commonly known as [[constructive treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="nb"|"And because that many other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which a man cannot think nor declare at this present time; it is accorded, that if any other case supposed treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any justice, the justice shall tarry without going to judgement of treason, till the cause be shewed and declared before the king and his parliament, whether it ought to be judged treason or other felony."

He was executed in January 1676.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Anthony |first=A.

Only one witness was required to convict a person of treason, although in 1547 this was increased to two.  Suspects were first questioned in private by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] before they were publicly tried.  They were allowed no witnesses or defence [[counsel]], and were generally presumed guilty from the outset.  This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians prompted the introduction of the [[Treason Act 1695]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tomkovicz|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]] was executed on 17 May 1521 for the crime of treason. The wording of his sentence has survived and indicates the precision with which the method of execution was described;  he was to be "laid on a hurdle and so drawn to the place of execution, and there to be hanged, cut down alive, your members to be cut off and cast in the fire, your bowels burnt before you, your head smitten off, and your body quartered and divided at the King's will, and God have mercy on your soul."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Lacey, B.

==Execution of the sentence==
{{See also|List of people hanged, drawn and quartered}}
Once sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution. During the early Middle Ages this journey may have been made tied directly to the back of a horse, but it subsequently became customary for the victim to be fastened instead to a wicker [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, itself tied to the horse.&lt;ref name="Bellamyp187"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Frederic William Maitland]] thought that this was probably to "[secure] for the hangman a yet living body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollock|Maitland|2007|p=500}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the word drawn, as in "to draw", has caused a degree of confusion.  One of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English Dictionary's]]'' definitions of draw is "to draw out the viscera or intestines of; to disembowel (a fowl, etc. before cooking, a traitor or other criminal after hanging)", but this is followed by "in many cases of executions it is uncertain whether this, or [to drag (a criminal) at a horse's tail, or on a hurdle or the like, to the place of execution; formerly a legal punishment of high treason], is meant. The presumption is that where ''drawn'' is mentioned after ''hanged'', the sense is as here."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = draw | title = Oxford English Dictionary | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/ | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at dictionary.oed.com | edition = 2 | year = 1989 | accessdate = 18 August 2010 | postscript = . | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060625103623/http://dictionary.oed.com/ | archivedate = 25 June 2006 | df = dmy-all }} {{OEDsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Ram Sharan Sharma]] arrived at the same conclusion: "Where, as in the popular ''hung, drawn and quartered'' [use] (meaning facetiously, of a person, completely disposed of), ''drawn'' follows ''hanged'' or ''hung'', it is to be referred to as the disembowelling of the traitor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharma|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The historian and author [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]] disagrees.  In an essay published on his website, he writes that the separate mention of evisceration is a relatively modern device, and that while it certainly took place on many occasions, the presumption that ''drawing'' means to disembowel is spurious.  Instead, drawing (as a method of transportation) may be mentioned after hanging because it was a supplementary part of the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mortimer | first = Ian | title = Why do we say 'hanged, drawn and quartered?' | url = http://www.ianmortimer.com/essays/drawing.pdf | publisher = ianmortimer.com | date = 30 March 2010 | accessdate = 20 August 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101122022519/http://www.ianmortimer.com/essays/drawing.pdf | archivedate = 22 November 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the top pane, [[Charles I of England|{{nowrap|Charles I}}]] is shown awaiting his execution.  In the bottom pane, one regicide is hanged and another quartered, while the latter's head is shown to the crowd.]]
Some reports indicate that during [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary&amp;nbsp;I]]'s reign bystanders were vocal in their support: while in transit convicts sometimes suffered directly at the hands of the crowd. [[William Wallace]] was whipped, attacked and had rotten food and waste thrown at him,&lt;ref name="BeadleHarrisonp12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beadle|Harrison|2008|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the priest [[Thomas Pilchard]] was reportedly barely alive by the time he reached the gallows in 1587.  Others found themselves admonished by "zealous and godly men";&lt;ref name="Bellamyp187"/&gt; it became customary for a preacher to follow the condemned, asking them to repent.  According to [[Samuel Clarke]], the [[Puritan]] clergyman [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]] (1558–1602) once managed to convince a young man at the gallows that he had been forgiven, enabling the youth to go to his death "with tears of joy in his eyes&amp;nbsp;... as if he actually saw himself delivered from the hell which he feared before, and heaven opened for receiving his soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|1654|p=853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the king's commission had been read aloud, the crowd was normally asked to move back from the scaffold before being addressed by the convict.&lt;ref name="Bellamyp191"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these speeches were mostly an admission of guilt (although few admitted treason),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; still they were carefully monitored by the sheriff and chaplain, who were occasionally forced to act; in 1588, Catholic priest [[William Dean (priest)|William Dean]]'s address to the crowd was considered so inappropriate that he was gagged almost to the point of suffocation.&lt;ref name="Bellamyp191"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollen|1908|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions on matters of allegiance and politics were sometimes put to the prisoner,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; as happened to [[Edmund Gennings]] in 1591. He was asked by [[priest hunter]] [[Richard Topcliffe]] to "confess his treason", but when Gennings responded "if to say Mass be treason, I confess to have done it and glory in it", Topcliffe ordered him to be quiet and instructed the hangman to push him off the ladder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollen|1908|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes the witness responsible for the condemned man's execution was also present.  A government spy, John Munday, was in 1582 present for the execution of [[Thomas Ford (martyr)|Thomas Ford]]. Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them.  The priest [[James Bell (priest)|James Bell]] was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, [[John Finch (martyr)|John Finch]], was "a-quarter-inge".  [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]] and Francis Edwardes were made to witness [[Ralph Crockett]]'s execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s religious supremacy before they were themselves executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart.  On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air.  The aim was usually to cause [[strangulation]] and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest [[John Payne (martyr)|John Payne]]'s death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs.  Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular [[William Hacket]] (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally [[emasculated]]—the latter, according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], to "show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood."{{refn|group="nb"|For an explanation of "corruption of blood", see [[Attainder]].}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Though many say that the disembowelling involved the criminal being slit open from the breastbone down, Geoffrey Robertson &lt;ref&gt;(2005) ''The Tyrannicide Brief'', London  Chatto &amp; Windus&lt;/ref&gt; shows photographs of the screw irons used, he states, to 'draw' the entrails through the anus, the opening having been first cut open it more than natural. This was the method used at the hanging, drawing and quartering of John Cooke, the prosecutor at Charles I's trial, and other regicides at the Restoration. --&gt;
A victim still conscious at that point might have seen his entrails burned, before his heart was removed and the body decapitated and quartered (chopped into four pieces).  The [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicide]] [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]], after being hanged for several minutes and then cut open in October 1660, was reported to have leaned across and hit his executioner—resulting in the swift removal of his head.  His entrails were thrown onto a nearby fire.&lt;ref name="ODNB Regicide"&gt;{{Citation | last = Nenner | first = Howard | title = Regicides (act. 1649) | volume = 1 | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | edition = online | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | date = September 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/70599 | accessdate = 16 August 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/70599}}  {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbottpp158159"&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="nb"|Harrison's sentence was "That you be led to the place from whence you came, and from thence be drawn upon a hurdle to the place of execution, and then you shall be hanged by the neck and, being alive, shall be cut down, and your privy members to be cut off, and your entrails be taken out of your body and, you living, the same to be burnt before your eyes, and your head to be cut off, your body to be divided into four quarters, and head and quarters to be disposed of at the pleasure of the King's majesty.

He speculates that the reasoning behind such bloody displays may have been to assuage the crowd's anger, to remove any human characteristics from the corpse, to rob the criminal's family of any opportunity to hold a meaningful funeral, or even to release any evil spirits contained within.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kastenbaum|2004|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of disembowelling the body may have originated in the medieval belief that treasonable thoughts were housed there, requiring that the convict's entrails be "purged by fire".&lt;ref name="Bellamyp204"/&gt;  [[Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Andrew Harclay]]'s "treasonous thoughts had originated in his 'heart, bowels, and entrails'", and so were to be "extracted and burnt to ashes, which would then be dispersed", as had happened with William Wallace and [[Gilbert de Middleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Westerhof|2008|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  At his execution in January 1606 for his involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], [[Guy Fawkes]] managed to break his neck by jumping from the gallows, cheating the executioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No records exist to demonstrate exactly how the corpse was quartered, although an engraving of the quartering of [[Sir Thomas Armstrong]] in 1684 shows the executioner making vertical cuts through the spine and removing the legs at the hip.{{sfn|Lewis|2008|pp=113–124|ps=}} The distribution of [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]]'s remains was described by [[Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet|Herbert Maxwell]]: "the right arm with a ring on the finger in York; the left arm in Bristol; the right leg and hip at Northampton; the left [leg] at Hereford.

The head was often displayed on [[London Bridge]], for centuries the route by which many travellers from the south entered the city.  Several eminent commentators remarked on the displays.  In 1566 [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] wrote that "in London there were many heads on the bridge&amp;nbsp;... I have seen there, as if they were masts of ships, and at the top of them, quarters of men's corpses."  In 1602 the [[Barnim X, Duke of Pomerania|Duke of Pommerania-Stettin]] emphasised the ominous nature of their presence when he wrote "near the end of the bridge, on the suburb side, were stuck up the heads of thirty gentlemen of high standing who had been beheaded on account of treason and secret practices against the Queen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="nb"|In 1534, a woman's head adorned the bridge; [[Elizabeth Barton]], a domestic servant and later [[nun]] who forecast the early death of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], was drawn to [[Tyburn]], and hanged and beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The practice of using London Bridge in this manner ended following the hanging, drawing, and quartering in 1678 of William Staley, a victim of the fictitious [[Popish Plot]].  His quarters were given to his relatives, who promptly arranged a "grand" funeral; this incensed the coroner so much that he ordered the body to be dug up and set upon the city gates.

Another victim of the Popish Plot, [[Oliver Plunkett]] the [[Archbishop of Armagh]], was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn in July 1681.

{{Quote | This energetic, but inflammatory appeal, was followed by such enthusiastic plaudits, that the Sheriff hinted to the Clergyman to withdraw, and forbade Colonel Despard to proceed.  The cap was then drawn over their eyes, during which the Colonel was observed again to fix the knot under his left ear, and, at seven minutes before nine o'clock the signal being given, the platform dropped, and they were all launched into eternity.  From the precaution taken by the Colonel, he appeared to suffer very little, neither did the others struggle much, except Broughton, who had been the most indecently profane of the whole. Wood, the soldier, died very hard.  The Executioners went under, and kept pulling them by the feet. Several drops of blood fell from the fingers of Macnamara and Wood, during the time they were suspended.  After hanging thirty-seven minutes, the Colonel's body was cut down, at half an hour past nine o'clock, and being stripped of his coat and waistcoat, it was laid upon saw-dust, with the head reclined upon a block.  A surgeon then in attempting to sever the head from the body by a common dissecting knife, missed the particular joint aimed at, when he kept haggling it, till the executioner was obliged to take the head between his hands, and to twist it several times round, when it was with difficulty severed from the body.  It was then held up by the executioner, who exclaimed—"''Behold the head of EDWARD MARCUS DESPARD, a Traitor!''"  The same ceremony followed with the others respectively; and the whole concluded by ten o'clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Granger|Caulfield|1804|pp=889–897}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He called it one of "the savage remains of Norman policy".&lt;ref name="Gatrellp317" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shelton|2009|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst a growing tide of public disgust at the burning of women, Parliament passed the [[Treason Act 1790]], which for women guilty of treason substituted hanging for burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was followed by the [[Treason Act 1814]], introduced by [[Samuel Romilly]], a legal reformer.  Influenced by his friend, [[Jeremy Bentham]], Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the [[Bloody Code|severity of England's laws]] was responsible for an increase in crime.  When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as "Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy,&lt;!-- this cited to previous citation, block/hostettler, no need for two cites so close together --&gt; and [[Treason Act 1814|in 1814]] proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal.  However, when it was pointed out that this would be a less severe punishment than that given for murder, he agreed that the corpse should also be decapitated, "as a fit punishment and appropriate stigma."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Romilly|1820|p=xlvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joycep105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joyce|1955|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is what happened to [[Jeremiah Brandreth]], leader of a 100-strong contingent of men in the [[Pentrich rising]] and one of three men executed in 1817 at [[Derby Gaol]].  As with Edward Despard and his confederates&lt;!-- see Gatrell pp317-318 --&gt; the three were drawn to the scaffold on sledges before being hanged for about an hour, and then on the insistence of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] were beheaded with an axe.  The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife.  As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled.  A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison.  Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Belchem | first = John | title = Brandreth, Jeremiah (1786/1790–1817) | volume = 1 | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | origyear = 2004 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3270 | accessdate = 19 August 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/3270}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plot was the last  crime for which the sentence was applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reformation of England's capital punishment laws continued throughout the 19th century, as politicians such as [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]], sought to remove from the statute books many of the capital offences that remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|pp=51–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Peel]]'s drive to ameliorate law enforcement saw petty treason abolished by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]], which removed the distinction between crimes formerly considered as petty treason, and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiener|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubber|2005|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864-1866]] recommended that there be no change to treason law, quoting the "more merciful" [[Treason Felony Act 1848]], which limited the punishment for most treasonous acts to [[penal servitude]].  Its report recommended that for "rebellion, assassination or other violence&amp;nbsp;...we are of opinion that the extreme penalty must remain",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levi|1866|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the most recent occasion (and ultimately, the last) on which anyone had been sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered was in November 1839, following the [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[Newport Rising]]—and those men sentenced to death were instead [[penal transportation|transported]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2007|pp=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report highlighted the changing public mood toward public executions (brought about in part by the growing prosperity created by the [[Industrial Revolution]]).  [[Home Secretary]] [[Spencer Horatio Walpole]] told the commission that executions had "become so demoralizing that, instead of its having a good effect, it has a tendency rather to brutalize the public mind than to deter the criminal class from committing crime".  The commission recommended that executions should be performed privately, behind prison walls and away from the public's view, "under such regulations as may be considered necessary to prevent abuse, and to satisfy the public that the law has been complied with."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McConville|1995|p=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of executing murderers in public was ended two years later by the [[Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868]], introduced by Home Secretary [[Gathorne Hardy]], but this did not apply to traitors.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;  An amendment to abolish capital punishment completely, suggested before the bill's third reading, failed by 127&amp;nbsp;votes to&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gatrell|1996|p=593}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|pp=59,&amp;nbsp;72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanging, drawing, and quartering was abolished in England by the [[Forfeiture Act 1870]], Liberal politician [[Sir Charles Forster, 1st Baronet|Charles Forster]]'s second attempt since 1864{{refn|group="nb"|Forster's first attempt passed through both Houses of Parliament without obstruction, but was dropped following a change of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Second Reading, HC Deb 30 March 1870 vol 200 cc931–8 | url = http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1870/mar/30/second-reading#S3V0200P0_18700330_HOC_9 | publisher = hansard.millbanksystems.com | date = 30 March 1870 | accessdate = 10 March 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121020165131/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1870/mar/30/second-reading#S3V0200P0_18700330_HOC_9 | archivedate = 20 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} to end the [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeiture]] of a felon's lands and goods (thereby not making paupers of his family).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anon 3|1870|p=N/A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anon 2|1870|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act limited the penalty for treason to hanging alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Forfeiture Act 1870 | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/33-34/23/crossheading/judgment-in-cases-of-high-treason/enacted | publisher = legislation.gov.uk | year = 1870 | accessdate = 10 March 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121113192243/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/33-34/23/crossheading/judgment-in-cases-of-high-treason/enacted | archivedate = 13 November 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it did not remove the monarch's right under the 1814 Act to replace hanging with beheading.&lt;ref name="Joycep105" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anon|1870|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beheading was abolished in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973 (c. 39), Sch. 1 Pt.

The death penalty for treason was abolished by the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], enabling the UK to ratify protocol six of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Windlesham|2001|p=81n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
In some of the places where the [[American War of Independence]] developed into a fierce civil war among American factions, there are recorded cases of both sides resorting to hanging, drawing, and quartering - both Loyalists and Patriots finding reasons to construe their opponents as being "traitors" deserving of such a fate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Allen. ''Tories: Fighting for the King in America's First Civil War''. New York, Harper, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Albert (ed.). ''An Uncivil War: The Southern Backcountry During the American Revolution''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Young (ed.). ''The American Revolution: Explorations in the History of American Radicalism''. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, David. [https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/armitage/files/scripting_revolutions.pdf Every Great Revolution Is a Civil War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203205332/http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/armitage/files/scripting_revolutions.pdf |date=3 December 2013 }}. In: Keith Michael Baker and Dan Edelstein (eds.). ''Scripting Revolution: A Historical Approach to the Comparative Study of Revolutions''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2015. According to Armitage, "The renaming can happen relatively quickly: for example, the transatlantic conflict of the 1770s that many contemporaries saw as a British "civil war" or even "the American Civil War" was first called "the American evolution" in 1776 by the chief justice of South Carolina, [[William Henry Drayton]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s prohibition of "[[Cruel and Unusual Punishment]]s" clearly (and successfully) aimed at preventing any further such usage on American soil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9983">In [[mathematics]], a '''limit point''' (or '''cluster point''' or '''accumulation point''') of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a point ''x'' that can be "approximated" by points of ''S'' in the sense that every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x'' with respect to the [[topology]] on ''X'' also contains a point of ''S'' other than ''x'' itself. A limit point of a set ''S'' does not itself have to be an element of ''S''.

This concept profitably generalizes the notion of a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and is the underpinning of concepts such as [[closed set]] and [[topological closure]]. Indeed, a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points, and the topological closure operation can be thought of as an operation that enriches a set by uniting it with its limit points.

There is also a closely related concept for [[sequence|sequences]]. A '''cluster point''' (or '''accumulation point''') of a [[sequence]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a point ''x'' such that, for every neighbourhood ''V'' of ''x'', there are infinitely many natural numbers ''n'' such that ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V''. This concept generalizes to [[net (mathematics)|nets]] and [[filter (mathematics)|filters]]. 

==Definition==
Let ''S'' be a subset of a [[topological space]] ''X''. 
A point ''x'' in ''X'' is a '''limit point''' (or '''cluster point''' or '''accumulation point''') of ''S'' if every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x'' contains at least one point of ''S'' different from ''x'' itself. 

Note that it doesn't make a difference if we restrict the condition to open neighbourhoods only. It is often convenient to use the "open neighbourhood" form of the definition to show that a point is a limit point and to use the "general neighbourhood" form of the definition to derive facts from a known limit point. 

If ''X'' is a [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]] (which all [[metric space|metric spaces]] are), then ''x'' &amp;isin; ''X'' is a limit point of ''S'' if and only if every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains infinitely many points of ''S''. Indeed, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces are characterized by this property. 

If ''X'' is a [[sequential space#Fréchet-Urysohn space|Fréchet–Urysohn space]] (which all [[metric space|metric spaces]] and [[first-countable space|first-countable spaces]] are), then ''x'' &amp;isin; ''X'' is a limit point of ''S'' if and only if there is a [[sequence]] of points in ''S''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{''x''} whose [[limit of a sequence|limit]] is ''x''. Indeed, Fréchet–Urysohn spaces are characterized by this property.

==Types of limit points==

Thus, thinking of sets, these points are limit points of the set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}.]]
|}
If every open set containing ''x'' contains infinitely many points of ''S'' then ''x'' is a specific type of limit point called an '''ω-accumulation point of ''S'''''.

If every open set containing ''x'' contains uncountably many points of ''S'' then ''x'' is a specific type of limit point called a '''[[condensation point]] of ''S'''''.

If every open set ''U'' containing ''x'' satisfies {{nowrap|{{!}}''U'' &amp;cap; ''S''{{!}} {{=}} {{!}}''S''{{!}}}} then ''x'' is a specific type of limit point called a '''{{visible anchor|complete accumulation point}} of ''S'''''.

==For Sequences and Nets==
In a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a point &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''cluster point'''  (or '''accumulation point''') of a sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} &lt;/math&gt; if, for every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, there are infinitely many &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x_n \in V &lt;/math&gt;. It is equivalent to say that for every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt; n_0 \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;, there is some &lt;math&gt; n \geq n_0 &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x_n \in V &lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]] or a [[first-countable space]]  (or, more generally, a [[Fréchet–Urysohn space]]), then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is cluster point of &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x &lt;/math&gt; is a limit of some subsequence of &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} &lt;/math&gt;. 
The set of all cluster points of a sequence is sometimes called the [[limit set]]. 

The concept of a [[net (mathematics)|net]] generalizes the idea of a [[sequence]]. A net is a function &lt;math&gt;f:(P,\le)\to X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(P,\le) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[directed set]] and &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a topological space. A point &lt;math&gt;x\in X &lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''cluster point'''  (or '''accumulation point''') of the net &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; if, for every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;p_0 \in P&lt;/math&gt;, there is some &lt;math&gt; p \ge p_0  &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f(p)\in V &lt;/math&gt;, equivalently, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Subnet (mathematics)|subnet]] which converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Cluster points in nets encompass the idea of both condensation points and ω-accumulation points. Clustering and limit points are also defined for the related topic of [[filter (mathematics)|filters]].

==Some Facts==
*We have the following characterization of limit points: ''x'' is a limit point of ''S'' if and only if it is in the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S'' \ {''x''}.
**''Proof'': We use the fact that a point is in the closure of a set if and only if every neighborhood of the point meets the set. Now, ''x'' is a limit point of ''S'', if and only if every neighborhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' other than ''x'', if and only if every neighborhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' \ {''x''}, if and only if ''x'' is in the closure of ''S'' \ {''x''}.
*If we use L(''S'') to denote the set of limit points of ''S'', then we have the following characterization of the closure of ''S'': The closure of ''S'' is equal to the union of ''S'' and L(''S''). This fact is sometimes taken as the ''definition'' of [[closure (topology)|closure]].
**''Proof'': ("Left subset") Suppose ''x'' is in the closure of ''S''. If ''x'' is in ''S'', we are done. If ''x'' is not in ''S'', then every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'', and this point cannot be ''x''. In other words, ''x'' is a limit point of ''S'' and ''x'' is in L(''S''). ("Right subset") If ''x'' is in ''S'', then every neighbourhood of ''x'' clearly meets ''S'', so ''x'' is in the closure of ''S''. If ''x'' is in L(''S''), then every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' (other than ''x''), so ''x'' is again in the closure of ''S''. This completes the proof.
*A corollary of this result gives us a characterisation of closed sets: A set ''S'' is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points.
**''Proof'': ''S'' is closed if and only if ''S'' is equal to its closure if and only if ''S'' = ''S'' ∪ L(''S'') if and only if L(''S'') is contained in ''S''.
**''Another proof'': Let ''S'' be a closed set and ''x'' a limit point of ''S''. If ''x'' is not in ''S'',  then the complement to ''S'' comprises an open neighbourhood of ''x''. Since ''x'' is a limit point of ''S'', any open neighbourhood of ''x'' should have a non-trivial intersection with ''S''. However, a set can not have a non-trivial intersection with its complement. Conversely, assume ''S'' contains all its limit points. We shall show that the complement of ''S'' is an open set. Let ''x'' be a point in the complement of ''S''. By assumption, ''x'' is not a limit point, and hence there exists an open neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' that does not intersect ''S'', and so ''U'' lies entirely in the complement of ''S''. Since this argument holds for arbitrary ''x'' in the complement of ''S'', the complement of ''S'' can be expressed as a union of open neighbourhoods of the points in the complement of ''S''. Hence the complement of ''S'' is open.
*No [[isolated point]] is a limit point of any set.
**''Proof'': If ''x'' is an isolated point, then {''x''} is a neighbourhood of ''x'' that contains no points other than ''x''.
*A space ''X'' is [[discrete space|discrete]] if and only if no subset of ''X'' has a limit point.
**''Proof'': If ''X'' is discrete, then every point is isolated and cannot be a limit point of any set. Conversely, if ''X'' is not discrete, then there is a singleton {''x''} that is not open. Hence, every open neighbourhood of {''x''} contains a point ''y'' ≠ ''x'', and so ''x'' is a limit point of ''X''.
* If a space ''X'' has the [[trivial topology]] and ''S'' is a subset of ''X'' with more than one element, then all elements of ''X'' are limit points of ''S''. If ''S'' is a singleton, then every point of ''X'' \ ''S'' is still a limit point of ''S''.
**''Proof'': As long as ''S'' \ {''x''} is nonempty, its closure will be ''X''. It's only empty when ''S'' is empty or ''x'' is the unique element of ''S''.
* By definition, every limit point is an [[adherent point]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">In [[logic]], a '''logical constant''' of a [[formal language|language]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] that has the same [[Formal semantics (logic)|semantic value]] under every [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;. Two important types of logical constants are [[logical connective]]s and [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s.  The [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] predicate (usually written '=') is also treated as a logical constant in many [[formal system|systems of logic]]. One of the fundamental questions in the [[philosophy of logic]] is "What is a logical constant?"; that is, what special feature of certain constants makes them ''logical'' in nature?&lt;ref&gt;Carnap&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}}

Some symbols that are commonly treated as logical constants are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Symbol
! Meaning in English
|-
| T
| "true"
|-
| F
| "[[false (logic)|false]]"
|-
| ¬
| "[[logical negation|not]]"
|-
| ∧
| "[[logical conjunction|and]]"
|-
| ∨
| "[[logical disjunction|or]]"
|-
| →
| "[[Material conditional|implies]]", "if...then"
|-
| ∀
| "[[for all]]"
|-
| ∃
| "[[there exists]]", "for some"
|-
| =
| "[[logical equality|equals]]"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;
| "necessarily"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt;
| "possibly"
|}

Many of these logical constants are sometimes denoted by alternate symbols (''e.g.'', the use of the symbol "&amp;" rather than "∧" to denote the [[logical and]]).

The '''monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force''', also known as the '''monopoly on violence''' ({{lang-de|Gewaltmonopol des Staates}}), is a core concept of modern public law, which goes back to [[Jean Bodin]]'s 1576 work ''[[Jean Bodin#Les Six livres de la R.C3.A9publique|Les Six livres de la République]]'' and [[Thomas Hobbes]]' 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.{{Citation needed|reason=If first described by Weber, how does it date to Bodin and Hobbes?|date=February 2016}} As the defining conception of the [[state (polity)|state]], it was first described in sociology by [[Max Weber]] in his essay ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society'', translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave Books, 2015, pp. 129-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber claims that the state is the "only human [[Gemeinschaft]] which lays claim to the monopoly on the legitimated [[use of force|use of physical force]]. However, this monopoly is limited to a certain geographical area, and in fact this limitation to a particular area is one of the things that defines a state."&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. Palgrave Books 2015, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Weber describes the state as any organization that succeeds in holding the exclusive right to use, threaten, or authorize  physical force against residents of its territory. Such a monopoly, according to Weber, must occur via a process of [[Legitimation#Power and influence|legitimation]].

==Max Weber's theory==
[[Max Weber]] wrote in ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' that a fundamental characteristic of statehood is the claim of such a monopoly.  His expanded definition was that something is "a 'state' if and insofar as its administrative staff successfully upholds a claim on the 'monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force' ({{lang-de|das Monopol legitimen physischen Zwanges}}) in the enforcement of its order."&lt;ref name=weber64&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Talcott|title=The Theory Of Social And Economic Organization|year=1964|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0684836409|pages=154|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-WaBpsJxaOkC&amp;dq=The+Theory+of+Social+and+Economic+Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber1921&gt;Weber, Max. Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft (1921). p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's concept has been formalized to show that the exclusive policing power of the state benefits social welfare via private property, provided the state acts benevolently in the interest of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;K. Grechenig, M. Kolmar, The State's Enforcement Monopoly and the Private Protection of Property, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2404617 Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) 2014, vol. 170 (1), 5-23].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Weber, the state is that "human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of violence within a given territory."  The public [[police]] and [[military]] are its main instruments, but [[private security]] might also be considered to have "the 'right' to use violence" so long as the sole source of this perceived right is state sanction.  Weber applied several caveats to his discussion of the state's monopoly of violence:
* He intended the statement as a contemporary observation, noting that the connection between the state and the use of physical force has not always been so close. He uses the examples of [[feudalism]], where [[feud|private warfare]] was permitted under certain conditions, and of [[Church courts|religious courts]], which had sole jurisdiction over some types of offenses, especially [[heresy]] and sex crimes (thus the nickname "bawdy courts"). Regardless, the state exists wherever a single authority can legitimately authorize violence.
* For the same reasons, the "monopoly" does not mean that only the government may use physical force, but that the state is that human community that successfully claims for itself to be the only source of legitimacy for all physical coercion or adjudication of coercion. For example, the law might permit individuals to use force in defense of one's [[Self-defense|self]] or [[Defence of property|property]], but this right derives from the state's authority. This conflicts directly with enlightenment principles of individual sovereignty that delegates power to the state by consent, and concepts of [[natural law]] that hold that individual rights deriving from sapient [[self-ownership]] preexist the state and are only recognised and guaranteed by the state which may be restricted from limiting them by [[constitutional law]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Criticisms of Weber ===
[[Robert Bates (political scientist)|Robert Hinrichs Bates]] argues that the state itself has no violent power; rather, the people hold all the power of coercion to ensure that order and other equilibriums hold up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BATES|first=R.|last2=GREIF|first2=A.|last3=SINGH|first3=S.|title=Organizing Violence|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=46|issue=5|pages=599–628|doi=10.1177/002200202236166|year=2002|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3707095}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this is that there is a frontier of well-being in stateless societies, that can only be surpassed if some level of coercion or violence is used to elevate the complexity of the state. In other words, without investing in troops, police, or some sort of enforcement mechanism, early states cannot enjoy the law and order (or prosperity) of more developed states.

==Relation to state capacity ==
The capacity of a state is often measured in terms of its [[Fiscal capacity|fiscal]] and [[Capacity (law)|legal capacity]]. Fiscal capacity meaning the state's ability to recover taxation to provide public goods, and legal capacity meaning the state's supremacy as sole arbiter of conflict resolution and contract enforcement. Without some sort of [[coercion]], the state would not otherwise be able to enforce its legitimacy in its desired sphere of influence.  In early and developing states, this role was often played by the "stationary bandit" who defended villagers from roving bandits, in the hope that the protection would incentivize villagers to invest in economic production, and the stationary bandit could eventually use its coercive power to expropriate some of that wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=September 1993|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions where state presence is minimally felt, non-state actors can use their monopoly of violence to establish legitimacy and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sicilian Mafia: the business of private protection|last=Gambetta|first=Diego|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Sicilian Mafia originated as a [[protection racket]] providing buyers and sellers in the black market with protection. Without this type of enforcement, market participants would not be otherwise confident enough to trust their counter-parties for valid contract enforcement and the market would collapse.

Even in illicit and underground markets (somewhat akin to stateless societies), violence is used to enforce contracts in the absence of accessible legal conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owens|first=Emily Greene|date=2011|title=Are Underground Markets Really More Violent? Evidence from Early 20th Century America|url=|journal=American Law and Economics Review|volume=v13, N1|pages=1–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles Tilly continues this comparison to say that warmaking and statemaking are actually the best representations of what organized crime can grow into.&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, Charles (1985). “War making and state making as organized crime,” in Bringing the State Back In, eds P.B. Evans, D. Rueschemeyer, &amp; T. Skocpol. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985. • Introduction and Chapt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
According to [[Raymond Aron]], [[international relations]] are characterized by the absence of widely acknowledged legitimacy in the use of force between states.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Aron. ''Paix et guerre entre les nations'', Paris 1962; English: ''Peace and War'', 1966. New edition 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martha Lizabeth Phelps, writing in ''[[Politics &amp; Policy]]'', takes Weber's ideas on the legitimacy of private security a step further.  Phelps claims that the use of private actors by the state remains legitimate if and only if military contractors are perceived 
as being controlled by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phelps|first1=Martha Lizabeth|title=Doppelgangers of the State: Private Security and Transferable Legitimacy|journal=Politics &amp; Policy|date=December 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=824–849|doi=10.1111/polp.12100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], the '''Navier–Stokes equations''' ({{IPAc-en|n|æ|v|ˈ|j|eː|_|s|t|əʊ|k|s}}), named after [[Claude-Louis Navier]] and [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]], describe the motion of [[viscous fluid]] substances.

These balance equations arise from applying [[Newton's second law|Isaac Newton's second law]] to [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], together with the assumption that the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the fluid is the sum of a [[diffusion|diffusing]] [[viscosity|viscous]] term (proportional to the [[gradient]] of velocity) and a [[pressure]] term—hence describing ''viscous flow''. The main difference between them and the simpler [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] for [[inviscid flow]] is that Navier–Stokes equations also factor in the [[Froude number|Froude limit]] (no external field) and are not [[conservation law|conservation equations]], but rather a [[dissipative system]], in the sense that they cannot be put into the quasilinear [[Homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \mathbf y_x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of [[scientific]] and [[engineering]] interest. They may be used to [[model (abstract)|model]] the weather, [[ocean current]]s, water [[flow conditioning|flow in a pipe]] and air flow around a [[airfoil|wing]]. The Navier–Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with [[Maxwell's equations]], they can be used to model and study [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether solutions always [[Existence theorem|exist]] in three dimensions and, if they do exist, whether they are [[Smoothness|smooth]] – i.e. they are infinitely differentiable at all points in the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]]. These are called the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]] problems. The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has called this one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems|seven most important open problems in mathematics]] and has offered a [[US$]]1&amp;nbsp;million prize for a solution or a counterexample.&lt;ref&gt;

==Flow velocity==
The solution of the Navier–Stokes equations is a [[flow velocity]]. It is a field, since it is defined at every point in a region of space and an interval of time. Once the velocity field is calculated other quantities of interest, such as [[pressure]] or [[temperature]], may be found using additional equations and relations. This is different from what one normally sees in [[classical mechanics]], where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a [[particle]] or deflection of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid; however for visualization purposes one can compute various [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|trajectories]].

==General continuum equations==
{{Main|Derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations}}
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Conservation form}}

The Navier–Stokes momentum equation can be derived as a particular form of the [[Cauchy momentum equation]], whose general convective form is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t} = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;
By setting the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to be the sum of a viscosity term &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Cauchy stress tensor#Stress deviator tensor|deviatoric stress]]) and a pressure term &lt;math&gt;-p\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; (volumetric stress) we arrive at

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(convective form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\rho\frac{D\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

where
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[convective derivative]],
* &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density,
* {{math|'''u'''}} is the flow velocity,
* &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[divergence]],
* {{math|''p''}} is the [[pressure]],
* {{math|''t''}} is [[time]],
* &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the deviatoric stress tensor, which has order two,
* {{math|'''g'''}} represents [[body force|body acceleration]]s acting on the continuum, for example [[gravity]], [[Fictitious force|inertial accelerations]], [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic accelerations]], and so on,

In this form, it is apparent that in the assumption of an inviscid fluid -no deviatoric stress- Cauchy equations reduce to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].

Assuming [[conservation of mass]] we can use the [[Continuity equation#Differential form|continuity equation]], &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho\,\mathbf{u}) = 0&lt;/math&gt; to arrive to the conservation form of the equations of motion. This is often written:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 137 &amp; 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(conservation form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t} (\rho\,\mathbf{u})
   + \nabla \cdot (\rho\,\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u})
 = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

where {{math|⊗}} is the [[outer product]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \otimes \mathbf v = \mathbf u \mathbf v^{\mathrm T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The left side of the equation describes acceleration, and may be composed of time-dependent and convective components (also the effects of non-inertial coordinates if present). The right side of the equation is in effect a summation of hydrostatic effects, the divergence of deviatoric stress and body forces (such as gravity).

All non-relativistic balance equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy equations and specifying the stress tensor through a [[constitutive relation]]. By expressing the deviatoric (shear) stress tensor in terms of [[viscosity]] and the fluid [[Shear velocity|velocity]] gradient, and assuming constant viscosity, the above Cauchy equations will lead to the Navier–Stokes equations below.

===Convective acceleration===
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Convective acceleration}}
[[Image:ConvectiveAcceleration vectorized.svg|thumb|An example of convection. Though the flow may be steady (time-independent), the fluid decelerates as it moves down the diverging duct (assuming incompressible or subsonic compressible flow), hence there is an acceleration happening over position.]]

A significant feature of the Cauchy equation and consequently all other continuum equations (including Euler and Navier–Stokes) is the presence of convective acceleration: the effect of acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual fluid particles indeed experience time-dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle.

==Compressible flow==
Remark: here, the Cauchy stress tensor is denoted &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (instead of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; as it was in the [[#General_continuum_equations|general continuum equations]] and in the [[#Incompressible_flow|incompressible flow section]]).

The compressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:&lt;ref name="Batchelor_142_148"/&gt;

*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galileian invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient {{math|∇'''u'''.}}
*the stress is '''linear''' in this variable: {{math|'''σ'''(∇'''u''') {{=}} '''C''' : (∇'''u'''),}} where {{math|'''C'''}} is the fourth-order tensor representing the constant of proportionality, called the viscosity or [[elasticity tensor]], and : is the [[Dyadics#Double-dot product|double-dot product]].
*the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently {{math|'''V'''}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the stress tensor is symmetric, by [[Helmholtz decomposition]] it can be expressed in terms of two scalar [[Lamé parameters]], the [[bulk viscosity]] {{mvar|λ}} and the [[dynamic viscosity]] {{mvar|μ}}, as it is usual in [[linear elasticity]]:

{{Equation box 1

: where {{math|'''I'''}} is the identity tensor, {{math|'''ε'''(∇'''u''') ≡ {{sfrac|2}}∇'''u''' + {{sfrac|2}}(∇'''u''')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the rate-of-[[strain tensor]] and {{math|∇ · '''u'''}} is the rate of expansion of the flow. So this decomposition can be explicited as:

:: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \lambda (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) \mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + ( \nabla\mathbf{u} )^\mathrm{T}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the rate-of-strain tensor in three dimensions is:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} (\boldsymbol \varepsilon) = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

The trace of the stress tensor in three dimensions becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} (\boldsymbol \sigma) = (3 \lambda + 2 \mu )\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

So by alternatively decomposing the stress tensor into '''isotropic''' and '''deviatoric''' parts, as usual in fluid dynamics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chorin |first1=Alexandre E. |last2=Marsden |first2=Jerrold E. |date=1993 |title=A Mathematical Introduction to Fluid Mechanics |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \left(\lambda + \tfrac23 \mu\right) \left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + \left( \nabla\mathbf{u} \right)^\mathrm{T} - \tfrac23 \left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the [[volume viscosity|second viscosity]] {{mvar|ζ}},

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta \equiv \lambda + \tfrac23 \mu ,&lt;/math&gt;

we arrive to the linear [[constitutive equation]] in the form usually employed in [[thermal hydraulics]]:&lt;ref name=Batchelor_142_148/&gt;

Both second viscosity {{mvar|ζ}} and dynamic viscosity {{mvar|μ}} need not be constant – in general, they depend on density, on each other (the viscosity is expressed in pressure), and in compressible flows also on temperature. Any equation expliciting one of these [[transport coefficient]] in the [[conservation variable]]s is called an [[equation of state]].&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1967 p. 165"/&gt;

By computing the divergence of the stress tensor, since the divergence of tensor {{math|∇'''u''' }} is {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''u''' }} and the divergence of tensor {{math|(∇'''u''')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math| ∇(∇ · '''u''')}}, one finally arrives to the compressible (most general) Navier–Stokes momentum equation:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 147 &amp; 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D/Dt&lt;/math&gt; is the [[material derivative]].
Bulk viscosity is assumed to be constant, otherwise it should not be taken out of the last derivative. The effect of the volume viscosity {{mvar|ζ}} is that the mechanical pressure is not equivalent to the thermodynamic [[pressure]]:&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Lifshitz (1987) pp. 44–45, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \bar{p} \equiv p - \zeta \, \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} ,&lt;/math&gt;

This difference is usually neglected, sometimes by explicitly assuming {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}}, but it could have an impact in sound absorption and attenuation and shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;White (2006) p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The convective acceleration term can also be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf u\cdot\nabla\mathbf u = (\nabla\times\mathbf u)\times\mathbf u + \frac{1}{2}\nabla\mathbf u^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where the vector &lt;math&gt;(\nabla\times\mathbf u)\times\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Lamb vector]].

For the special case of an [[incompressible flow]], the pressure constrains the flow so that the volume of [[fluid element]]s is constant: [[isochoric process|isochoric flow]] resulting in a [[Solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]] velocity field with {{math|∇ · '''u''' {{=}} 0.}}&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incompressible flow==
The incompressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:&lt;ref name=Batchelor_142_148&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 142–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galilean invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient {{math|∇'''u'''}}.
*the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently {{math|'''τ'''}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the deviatoric stress tensor can be expressed in terms of the [[dynamic viscosity]] {{mvar|μ}}:

::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \mathbf{\nabla u} + \mathbf{\nabla u}^\mathrm{T} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Dynamic viscosity {{mvar|μ}} need not be constant – in incompressible flows it can depend on density and on pressure. Any equation expliciting one of these [[transport coefficient]] in the [[conservative variable]]s is called an [[equation of state]].&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1967 p. 165"&gt;Batchelor (1967) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The divergence of the deviatoric stress is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau = 2 \mu \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \varepsilon = \mu \nabla \cdot \left( \nabla\mathbf{u} + \nabla\mathbf{u} ^\mathrm{T} \right) = \mu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

because &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u}=0&lt;/math&gt; for an incompressible fluid.
Incompressibility rules out density and pressure waves like sound or [[shock wave]]s, so this simplification is not useful if these phenomena are of interest. The incompressible flow assumption typically holds well with all fluids at low [[Mach number]]s (say up to about Mach 0.3), such as for modelling air winds at normal temperatures.&lt;ref name="Ach"&gt;See Acheson (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; For incompressible (uniform density ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) flows the following identity holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {\rho_0} \nabla p = \nabla \left(\frac p {\rho_0} \right) \equiv \nabla w&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|w}} is the specific (with the sense of ''per unit mass'') [[thermodynamic work]], the internal source term. Then the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are best visualised by dividing for the density:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''[[Incompressible flow|Incompressible]] Navier–Stokes equations''' (''convective form'')
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} - \nu \,\nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = - \nabla w + \mathbf{g}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden
| A laminar flow example |
Velocity profile (laminar flow):

:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = 0, \quad u(y) = u, \quad u(z) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for the {{mvar|y}}-direction, simplify the Navier–Stokes equation:

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\frac{dP}{dx} + \mu\left(\frac{d^2u}{dy^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Integrate twice to find the velocity profile with boundary conditions {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''h''}}, {{math|''u'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''y'' {{=}} −''h''}}, {{math|''u'' {{=}} 0}}:

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{1}{2\mu}\frac{dP}{dx} y^2 + Ay + B&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation, substitute in the two boundary conditions to get two equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 0 &amp;= \frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} h^2 + Ah + B \\ 0 &amp;= \frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} h^2 - Ah + B \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Add and solve for {{mvar|B}}:

:&lt;math&gt;B = -\frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} h^2&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute and solve for {{mvar|A}}:

:&lt;math&gt;A = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Finally this gives the velocity profile:

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} (y^2 - h^2)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

It is well worth observing the meaning of each term (compare to the [[Cauchy momentum equation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
 \overbrace{
 \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{Variation}
 \end{smallmatrix}} +
 \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{Convection}
 \end{smallmatrix}}}^{\text{Inertia (per volume)}}
 \overbrace{-\underbrace{\nu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{Diffusion}}=
 \underbrace{-\nabla w}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{Internal} \\
 \text{source}
 \end{smallmatrix}}}^{\text{Divergence of stress}} +
 \underbrace{\mathbf{g}}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{External} \\
 \text{source}
 \end{smallmatrix}}
 .
&lt;/math&gt;

The higher-order term, namely the [[shear stress]] divergence {{math|∇ · ''τ''}}, has simply reduced to the [[vector laplacian]] term {{math|''μ''∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''u'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 21 &amp; 147.&lt;/ref&gt; This laplacian term can be interpreted as the difference between the velocity at a point and the mean velocity in a small surrounding volume. This implies that – for a Newtonian fluid – viscosity operates as a ''diffusion of momentum'', in much the same way as the [[heat conduction]]. In fact neglecting the convection term, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations lead to a vector [[diffusion equation]] (namely [[Stokes flow|Stokes equations]]), but in general the convection term is present, so incompressible Navier–Stokes equations belong to the class of [[convection-diffusion equation]]s.

In the usual case of an external field being a [[conservative field]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf g = - \nabla \phi &lt;/math&gt;

by defining the [[hydraulic head]]:

:&lt;math&gt;h \equiv w + \phi &lt;/math&gt;

one can finally condense the whole source in one term, arriving to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation with conservative external field:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} - \nu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = - \nabla h.&lt;/math&gt;

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with conservative external field is the '''fundamental equation of [[hydraulics]]'''. The domain for these equations is commonly a 3 or less [[Euclidean space]], for which an [[orthogonal coordinate]] reference frame is usually set to explicit the system of scalar partial differential equations to be solved. In 3D orthogonal coordinate systems are 3: [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]], [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical]], and [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]]. Expressing the Navier–Stokes vector equation in Cartesian coordinates is quite straightforward and not much influenced by the number of dimensions of the euclidean space employed, and this is the case also for the first-order terms (like the variation and convection ones) also in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems. But for the higher order terms (the two coming from the divergence of the deviatoric stress that distinguish Navier–Stokes equations from Euler equations) some [[tensor calculus]] is required for deducing an expression in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems.

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is composite, the sum of two orthogonal equations,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} &amp;= \Pi^S\left(-(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} + \nu\,\nabla^2\mathbf{u}\right) + \mathbf{f}^S \\
\rho^{-1}\,\nabla p &amp;= \Pi^I\left(-(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} + \nu\,\nabla^2\mathbf{u}\right) + \mathbf{f}^I
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Π&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|Π&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are solenoidal and irrotational projection operators satisfying {{math|Π&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt; + Π&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}} and {{math|'''f'''&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|'''f'''&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the non-conservative and conservative parts of the body force. This result follows from the [[Helmholtz decomposition|Helmholtz Theorem]] (also known as the fundamental theorem of vector calculus). The first equation is a pressureless governing equation for the velocity, while the second equation for the pressure is a functional of the velocity and is related to the pressure Poisson equation.

The explicit functional form of the projection operator in 3D is found from the Helmholtz Theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^S\,\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\nabla\times\int \frac{\nabla^\prime\times\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} d V', \quad \Pi^I = 1-\Pi^S&lt;/math&gt;

with a similar structure in 2D. Thus the governing equation is an [[integro-differential equation]] similar to [[Coulomb law|Coulomb]] and [[Biot-Savart law]], not convenient for numerical computation.

An equivalent weak or variational form of the equation, proved to produce the same velocity solution as the Navier–Stokes equation,&lt;ref&gt;

for divergence-free test functions {{math|'''w'''}} satisfying appropriate boundary conditions. Here, the projections are accomplished by the orthogonality of the solenoidal and irrotational function spaces. The discrete form of this is eminently suited to finite element computation of divergence-free flow, as we shall see in the next section. There one will be able to address the question "How does one specify pressure-driven (Poiseuille) problems with a pressureless governing equation?".

The absence of pressure forces from the governing velocity equation demonstrates that the equation is not a dynamic one, but rather a kinematic equation where the divergence-free condition serves the role of a conservation equation. This all would seem to refute the frequent statements that the incompressible pressure enforces the divergence-free condition.

===Discrete velocity===
With partitioning of the problem domain and defining [[basis function]]s on the partitioned domain, the discrete form of the governing equation is,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{w}_i, \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}_j}{\partial t}\right) = -\left(\mathbf{w}_i, (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}_j\right) - \nu(\nabla\mathbf{w}_i: \nabla\mathbf{u}_j) + \left(\mathbf{w}_i, \mathbf{f}^S\right).&lt;/math&gt;

It is desirable to choose basis functions which reflect the essential feature of incompressible flow – the elements must be divergence-free. While the velocity is the variable of interest, the existence of the stream function or vector potential is necessary by the Helmholtz Theorem. Further, to determine fluid flow in the absence of a pressure gradient, one can specify the difference of stream function values across a 2D channel, or the line integral of the tangential component of the vector potential around the channel in 3D, the flow being given by [[Stokes' Theorem]]. Discussion will be restricted to 2D in the following.

We further restrict discussion to continuous Hermite finite elements which have at least first-derivative degrees-of-freedom. With this, one can draw a large number of candidate triangular and rectangular elements from the [[Bending of plates|plate-bending]] literature. These elements have derivatives as components of the gradient. In 2D, the gradient and curl of a scalar are clearly orthogonal, given by the expressions,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla\phi &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x},\,\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}\right)^\mathrm{T}, \\
\nabla\times\phi &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y},\,-\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right)^\mathrm{T}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Adopting continuous plate-bending elements, interchanging the derivative degrees-of-freedom and changing the sign of the appropriate one gives many families of stream function elements.

Taking the curl of the scalar stream function elements gives divergence-free velocity elements.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement that the stream function elements be continuous assures that the normal component of the velocity is continuous across element interfaces, all that is necessary for vanishing divergence on these interfaces.

Boundary conditions are simple to apply. The stream function is constant on no-flow surfaces, with no-slip velocity conditions on surfaces.
Stream function differences across open channels determine the flow. No boundary conditions are necessary on open boundaries, though consistent values may be used with some problems. These are all Dirichlet conditions.

The algebraic equations to be solved are simple to set up, but of course are [[#Nonlinearity|non-linear]], requiring iteration of the linearized equations.

Similar considerations apply to three-dimensions, but extension from 2D is not immediate because of the vector nature of the potential, and there exists no simple relation between the gradient and the curl as was the case in 2D.

===Pressure recovery===
Recovering pressure from the velocity field is easy. The discrete weak equation for the pressure gradient is,
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{g}_i, \nabla p) = -\left(\mathbf{g}_i, \left(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{u}_j\right) - \nu\left(\nabla\mathbf{g}_i: \nabla\mathbf{u}_j\right) + \left(\mathbf{g}_i, \mathbf{f}^I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the test/weight functions are irrotational. Any conforming scalar finite element may be used. However, the pressure gradient field may also be of interest. In this case one can use scalar Hermite elements for the pressure. For the test/weight functions {{math|'''g'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} one would choose the irrotational vector elements obtained from the gradient of the pressure element.

==Non-inertial frame of reference==

The rotating frame of reference introduces some interesting pseudo-forces into the equations through the [[material derivative]] term. Consider a stationary inertial frame of reference K, and a non-inertial frame of reference K', which is translating with velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf U(t)&lt;/math&gt; and rotating with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega(t)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the stationary frame. The Navier–Stokes equation observed from the non-inertial frame then becomes

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; are measured in the non-inertial frame. The first term in the parenthesis represents [[Coriolis acceleration]], the second term is due to [[centripetal force|centripetal acceleration]], the third is due to the linear acceleration of K' with respect to K and the fourth term is due to the angular acceleration of K' with respect to K.

==Other equations==
The Navier–Stokes equations are strictly a statement of the balance of momentum. To fully describe fluid flow, more information is needed, how much depending on the assumptions made. This additional information may include boundary data ([[no-slip condition|no-slip]], [[capillary surface]], etc.), conservation of mass, balance of energy, and/or an [[equation of state]].

===Continuity equation for incompressible fluid===
{{main|Continuity equation}}

Regardless of the flow assumptions, a statement of the [[conservation of mass]] is generally necessary. This is achieved through the mass [[continuity equation]], given in its most general form as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or, using the [[substantive derivative]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D\rho}{Dt} + \rho (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In the example below we can assume to have a [[Newtonian fluid]] as well as having {{mvar|ρ}} and {{mvar|μ}} both be constant.

Recall that mass continuity is simply the summation of the rate of mass in and the rate of mass out.
: rate of mass accumulated = rate of mass in − rate of mass out

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta x \, \Delta \, y \Delta z \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &amp;= \Delta y \, \Delta z \left (\rho U_x|_x - \rho U_x|_{x + \Delta x} \right) + \Delta x \Delta z \left(\rho U_y|_y - \rho U_y|_{y + \Delta y} \right) + \Delta \, x\Delta y \left (\rho U_z|_z - \rho U_z|_{z + \Delta z} \right ) \\[8pt]
\Rightarrow \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &amp;= \frac{\rho U_x|_x - \rho U_x|_{x + \Delta x}}{\Delta x} + \frac{\rho U_y|_y- \rho U_y|_{y + \Delta y}}{\Delta y} + \frac{\rho U_z|_z - \rho U_z|_{z + \Delta z}}{\Delta z} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \rho \left (\frac{U_x|_x - U_x|_{x + \Delta x}}{\Delta x} + \frac{U_y|_y - U_y|_{y + \Delta y}}{\Delta y} + \frac{U_z|_z - U_z|_{z + \Delta z}}{\Delta z} \right ) \\[6pt]
&amp;= -\rho \left (\frac{\partial U_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial U_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial U_z}{\partial z} \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since there is no change in density {{mvar|ρ}} over time, {{math|{{sfrac|∂''ρ''|∂''t''}} {{=}} 0}}, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = -\rho \left (\frac{\partial U_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial U_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial U_z}{\partial z} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that {{mvar|ρ}} is a constant thus proving the divergence theorem above.

==Stream function for 2D equations==
Taking the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the Navier–Stokes equation results in the elimination of pressure. This is especially easy to see if 2D Cartesian flow is assumed (like in the degenerate 3D case with {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}} and no dependence of anything on {{mvar|z}}), where the equations reduce to:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \rho \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\right)
 &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial y^2}\right) + \rho g_x \\
 \rho \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}\right)
 &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial y^2}\right) + \rho g_y.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the first with respect to {{mvar|y}}, the second with respect to {{mvar|x}} and subtracting the resulting equations will eliminate pressure and any [[conservative force]]. Defining the [[stream function]] {{mvar|ψ}} through

:&lt;math&gt;u_x = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}; \quad u_y = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

results in mass continuity being unconditionally satisfied (given the stream function is continuous), and then incompressible Newtonian 2D momentum and mass conservation condense into one equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) - \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) = \nu \nabla^4 \psi&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the 2D [[biharmonic operator]] and {{mvar|ν}} is the [[kinematic viscosity]], {{math|''ν'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''μ''|''ρ''}}}}. We can also express this compactly using the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) + \frac{\partial\left(\psi, \nabla^2\psi \right)}{\partial(y,x)} = \nu \nabla^4 \psi.&lt;/math&gt;

This single equation together with appropriate boundary conditions describes 2D fluid flow, taking only kinematic viscosity as a parameter. Note that the equation for [[creeping flow]] results when the left side is assumed zero.

In [[axisymmetric]] flow another stream function formulation, called the [[Stokes stream function]], can be used to describe the velocity components of an incompressible flow with one [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] function.

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is a [[differential algebraic equation]], having the inconvenient feature that there is no explicit mechanism for advancing the pressure in time. Consequently, much effort has been expended to eliminate the pressure from all or part of the computational process. The stream function formulation eliminates the pressure but only in two dimensions and at the expense of introducing higher derivatives and elimination of the velocity, which is the primary variable of interest.

==Properties==
===Nonlinearity===

The Navier–Stokes equations are [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equations]] in the general case and so remain in almost every real situation.&lt;ref&gt;Fluid Mechanics (Schaum's Series), M. Potter, D.C. Wiggert, Schaum's Outlines, McGraw-Hill (USA), 2008, {{isbn|978-0-07-148781-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vectors, Tensors, and the basic Equations of Fluid Mechanics, R. Aris, Dover Publications, 1989, {{isbn|0-486-66110-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as one-dimensional flow and [[Stokes flow]] (or creeping flow), the equations can be simplified to linear equations. The nonlinearity makes most problems difficult or impossible to solve and is the main contributor to the [[turbulence]] that the equations model.

The nonlinearity is due to [[convective]] acceleration, which is an acceleration associated with the change in velocity over position. Hence, any convective flow, whether turbulent or not, will involve nonlinearity. An example of convective but [[laminar flow|laminar]] (nonturbulent) flow would be the passage of a viscous fluid (for example, oil) through a small converging [[nozzle]]. Such flows, whether exactly solvable or not, can often be thoroughly studied and understood.&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{isbn|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turbulence===

[[Turbulence]] is the time-dependent [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior seen in many fluid flows. It is generally believed that it is due to the [[inertia]] of the fluid as a whole: the culmination of time-dependent and convective acceleration; hence flows where inertial effects are small tend to be laminar (the [[Reynolds number]] quantifies how much the flow is affected by inertia). It is believed, though not known with certainty, that the Navier–Stokes equations describe turbulence properly.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales that are involved in turbulent flow, the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or [[direct numerical simulation]]. Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations]] (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the [[Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model|Spalart–Allmaras]], [[k-omega turbulence model|{{mvar|k}}–{{mvar|ω}}]], [[turbulence kinetic energy|{{mvar|k}}–{{mvar|ε}}]], and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. [[Large eddy simulation]] (LES) can also be used to solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive—in time and in computer memory—than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger turbulent scales.

===Applicability===
{{further|Discretization of Navier–Stokes equations}}
Together with supplemental equations (for example, conservation of mass) and well formulated boundary conditions, the Navier–Stokes equations seem to model fluid motion accurately; even turbulent flows seem (on average) to agree with real world observations.

The Navier–Stokes equations assume that the fluid being studied is a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] (it is infinitely divisible and not composed of particles such as atoms or molecules), and is not moving at [[Special relativity#Relativistic mechanics|relativistic velocities]]. At very small scales or under extreme conditions, real fluids made out of discrete molecules will produce results different from the continuous fluids modeled by the Navier–Stokes equations. For example, [[capillarity]] of internal layers in fluids appears for flow with high gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Another limitation is simply the complicated nature of the equations. Time-tested formulations exist for common fluid families, but the application of the Navier–Stokes equations to less common families tends to result in very complicated formulations and often to open research problems. For this reason, these equations are usually rewritten for [[Newtonian fluid]]s where the viscosity model is [[linear]]; truly general models for the flow of other kinds of fluids (such as blood) do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Application to specific problems==
The Navier–Stokes equations, even when written explicitly for specific fluids, are rather generic in nature and their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse. This is partly because there is an enormous variety of problems that may be modeled, ranging from as simple as the distribution of static pressure to as complicated as [[multiphase flow]] driven by [[surface tension]].

Generally, application to specific problems begins with some flow assumptions and initial/boundary condition formulation, this may be followed by [[Scale analysis (mathematics)|scale analysis]] to further simplify the problem.

[[Image:NSConvection vectorial.svg|thumb|400px|Visualization of '''(a)''' parallel flow and '''(b)''' radial flow.]]

===Parallel flow===
Assume steady, parallel, one dimensional, non-convective pressure-driven flow between parallel plates, the resulting scaled (dimensionless) [[boundary value problem]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = -1; \quad u(0) = u(1) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary condition is the [[no slip condition]]. This problem is easily solved for the flow field:
:&lt;math&gt;u(y) = \frac{y - y^2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this point onward more quantities of interest can be easily obtained, such as viscous drag force or net flow rate.

===Radial flow===
Difficulties may arise when the problem becomes slightly more complicated. A seemingly modest twist on the parallel flow above would be the ''radial'' flow between parallel plates; this involves convection and thus non-linearity. The velocity field may be represented by a function {{math|''f''(''z'')}} that must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 f}{d z^2} + R f^2 = -1; \quad f(-1) = f(1) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[ordinary differential equation]] is what is obtained when the Navier–Stokes equations are written and the flow assumptions applied (additionally, the pressure gradient is solved for). The [[nonlinear]] term makes this a very difficult problem to solve analytically (a lengthy [[Implicit function|implicit]] solution may be found which involves [[elliptic integrals]] and [[Cubic formula|roots of cubic polynomials]]). Issues with the actual existence of solutions arise for {{math|''R'' &gt; 1.41}} (approximately; this is not [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]), the parameter R being the Reynolds number with appropriately chosen scales.&lt;ref name="TM Shah"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah |first=Tasneem Mohammad|title=Analysis of the multigrid method|journal=Nasa Sti/recon Technical Report N|volume=91|pages=23418|bibcode=1989STIN...9123418S|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of flow assumptions losing their applicability, and an example of the difficulty in "high" Reynolds number flows.&lt;ref name="TM Shah"/&gt;

===Convection===
A type of natural convection which can be described by the Navier–Stokes equation is the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]]. It is one of the most commonly studied convection phenomena because of its analytical and experimental accessibility.

==Exact solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations==
Some exact solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations exist. Examples of degenerate cases — with the non-linear terms in the Navier–Stokes equations equal to zero — are [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation|Poiseuille flow]], [[Couette flow]] and the oscillatory [[Stokes boundary layer]]. But also more interesting examples, solutions to the full non-linear equations, exist such as [[Jeffery–Hamel flow]], [[Von Kármán swirling flow]], [[Stagnation point flow]], [[Landau–Squire jet]], [[Taylor–Green vortex]].&lt;ref&gt;

Note that the existence of these exact solutions does not imply they are stable: turbulence may develop at higher Reynolds numbers.

Under additional assumptions, the component parts can be separated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claudino.webs.com/Navier%20Stokes%20Equations.pps]&lt;/ref&gt;

(Note this is not a solution to the Clay Millennium problem because that refers to incompressible fluids where {{mvar|ρ}} is a constant, neither does it deal with the uniqueness of the Navier–Stokes equations with respect to any [[turbulence]] properties.) It is also worth pointing out that the components of the velocity vector are exactly those from the [[Pythagorean quadruple]] parametrization. Other choices of density and pressure are possible with the same velocity field:

{{hidden
|Other choices of density and pressure
|Another choice of pressure and density with the same velocity vector above is one where the pressure and density fall to zero at the origin and are highest in the central loop at {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x&amp;:\ &amp;\rho \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y} + u_z \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}\right) &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial z^2}\right) + \frac{1}{3} \mu \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \right) + \rho g_x \\
 y&amp;:\ &amp;\rho \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}+ u_z \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z}\right) &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial z^2}\right) + \frac{1}{3} \mu \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \right) + \rho g_y \\
 z&amp;:\ &amp;\rho \left(\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y}+ u_z \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}\right) &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_z}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_z}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_z}{\partial z^2}\right) + \frac{1}{3} \mu \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \right) + \rho g_z.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that gravity has been accounted for as a body force, and the values of {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} will depend on the orientation of gravity with respect to the chosen set of coordinates.

The continuity equation reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_x \right) }{ \partial x} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_y\right) }{ \partial y} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_z\right) }{ \partial z} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

When the flow is incompressible, {{mvar|ρ}} does not change for any fluid particle, and its [[material derivative]] vanishes: {{math|{{sfrac|''Dρ''|''Dt''}} {{=}} 0}}. The continuity equation is reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u_x }{ \partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y }{ \partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z }{ \partial z} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for the incompressible version of the Navier–Stokes equation the second part of the viscous terms fall away (see [[Incompressible flow]]).

This system of four equations comprises the most commonly used and studied form. Though comparatively more compact than other representations, this is still a [[nonlinear]] system of [[partial differential equations]] for which solutions are difficult to obtain.

The gravity components will generally not be constants, however for most applications either the coordinates are chosen so that the gravity components are constant or else it is assumed that gravity is counteracted by a pressure field (for example, flow in horizontal pipe is treated normally without gravity and without a vertical pressure gradient). The continuity equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\rho r u_r\right) + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \left(\rho u_\phi\right)}{\partial \phi} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_z\right)}{\partial z} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

This cylindrical representation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is the second most commonly seen (the first being Cartesian above). Cylindrical coordinates are chosen to take advantage of symmetry, so that a velocity component can disappear. A very common case is axisymmetric flow with the assumption of no tangential velocity ({{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}), and the remaining quantities are independent of {{mvar|φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Mass continuity will read:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\rho r^2 u_r\right) + \frac{1}{r \sin{\theta}}\frac{\partial \rho u_\phi}{\partial \phi} + \frac{1}{r \sin{\theta}}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin{\theta} \rho u_\theta\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations could be (slightly) compacted by, for example, factoring {{math|{{sfrac|1|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} from the viscous terms. However, doing so would undesirably alter the structure of the Laplacian and other quantities.

==Navier–Stokes equations use in games==
The Navier–Stokes equations are used extensively in [[video games]] in order to model a wide variety of natural phenomena. Simulations of small-scale gaseous fluids, such as fire and smoke, are often based on the seminal paper "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| year=2003
| title=Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jos Stam]], which elaborates one of the methods proposed in Stam's earlier, more famous paper "Stable Fluids"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| year=1999

}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1999. Stam proposes stable fluid simulation using a Navier–Stokes solution method from 1968, coupled with an unconditionally stable semi-Lagrangian [[advection]] scheme, as first proposed in 1992.

More recent implementations based upon this work run on the game systems [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) as opposed to the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and achieve a much higher degree of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Many improvements have been proposed to Stam's original work, which suffers inherently from high numerical dissipation in both velocity and mass.

'''Nelle Artis Coley''', a noted educator, was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro, NC]] in 1909.  She attended local [[Parochial school|parochial primary schools]] (Episcopal and Lutheran) in Greensboro before starting public school (Washington Street School?). She entered [[Bennett College]] in 1926, completing her high school studies in 1927.  For the next four years, she alternated her studies with summer employment as a waitress in restaurants on the [[Jersey Shore|New Jersey shore]].  She completed her undergraduate studies at Bennett College in 1931. Unable to find work in Greensboro, she moved to [[Beaufort, North Carolina]], where she found a teaching job.

Mrs. Coley continued teaching in Beaufort through the early 1930s, and spent her summers in New York, pursuing graduate studies at [[Columbia University]]. She completed her graduate studies at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] in 1935. In the fall of 1935, she returned to Greensboro and started teaching at James B. Dudley Senior High.  She taught English courses at Dudley until her retirement in 1980.  Mrs. Coley died on April 14, 1999 after a brief illness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5570">'''Nominative use''', also "nominative fair use", is a legal [[doctrine]] that provides an [[affirmative defense]] to [[trademark]] infringement as enunciated by the [[United States]] [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]],&lt;ref name=Doellinger&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/njtip/v1/n1/5/Doellinger.pdf |first=Chad J. |last = Doellinger|title=Nominative Fair Use: Jardine and the Demise of a Doctrine | year= 2003|volume=1|issue=1|accessdate=2007-12-02 |format= pdf|journal=Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property|publisher=Northwestern University}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which a person may use the trademark of another as a reference to describe the other product, or to compare it to their own. Nominative use may be considered to be either related to, or a type of "trademark fair use" (sometimes called "classic fair use" or "statutory fair use").  All "trademark fair use" doctrines, however classified, are distinct from the [[fair use|fair use doctrine in copyright law]].  However, the fair use of a trademark may be protected under copyright laws depending on the complexity or creativity of the mark as a design logo.&lt;ref name='Pratt'&gt;Pratt, Jacqueline Levasseur.  "Not All Is Fair (Use) in Trademarks and Copyrights."  ''INTA Bulletin'', Vol 67, No 16. International Trademark Association, 15 September 2012.  &lt;http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/NotAllIsFair(Use)inTrademarksandCopyrights.aspx&gt;. 6 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nominative use test essentially states that one party may use or refer to the trademark of another if:

# The product or service cannot be readily identified without using the trademark (e.g. trademark is descriptive of a person, place, or product attribute).
# The user only uses as much of the mark as is necessary for the identification (e.g. the words but not the font or symbol).
# The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.  This applies even if the nominative use is commercial, and the same test applies for [[metatags]].

Furthermore, if a use is found to be nominative, then by the definition of non-trademark uses, it can not dilute the trademark.&lt;ref name="isbn1-57018-313-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=David S. Welkowitz |title=Trademark Dilution: Federal, State, and International Law |publisher=BNA Books (Bureau of National Affairs) |location= |year= 2002|isbn=1-57018-313-9 |quote=Since nominative fair uses are nontrademark uses, no dilution can occur|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominative use does ''not'' require that ownership of the trademark be acknowledged, for example by use of a sentence such as "UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open Group". Such statements may, however, be required by the terms of a license agreement between the parties, and they may be prudent (and courteous) as a way of preventing misunderstandings or allegations of [[passing off]].

==History of the doctrine==
The nominative use doctrine was first enunciated in 1992 by the U.S. [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in ''[[New Kids on the Block v. News America Publishing, Inc.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Kids on the Block v. News America Publishing, Inc.]]'', [[Case citation|971 F.2d 302]] ([[9th Cir.]] 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''New Kids on the Block'', the court had examined a "[[New Kids on the Block]] [[opinion poll|survey]]" performed by the [[defendant]], and found that there was no way to ask people their opinion of the band without using its name.  For instance, one could refer to the Minnesota Twins as "that professional baseball team from Minnesota," but it is much more acceptable to just refer to them by their trade name.&lt;ref name='Pratt' /&gt;

ITn ''[[Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles]]'', [[Case citation|279 F.3d 796]] ([[9th Cir.]] 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Playboy Playmate]] [[Terri Welles]] was sued for using the trademarked term "Playmate of the Year" in a [[Meta keywords|meta keyword]] within the [[HTML]] code of her [[website]]. The court found that Welles had to use the term to completely describe herself, as she had been given that title by the trademark holder. In other words, individuals are not compelled by trademark law to use "absurd turns of phrase" simply to avoid trademark liability.&lt;ref name='Pratt' /&gt; 

In ''New Kids'' and in ''Playboy v. Welles'', the courts examined older cases, identifying a unifying principle that they then named "nominative use".  Among the older cases cited by the Court in ''Playboy v. Welles'' was ''Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church'',&lt;ref&gt;''Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church'', 411 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Ninth Circuit had ruled that an independent auto repair shop that specialized in repairing Volkswagen cars and mentioned that fact in their advertising was not liable for trademark infringement so long as they did not claim or imply that they had any business relationship with the Volkswagen company. In the case of ''Yue v. MSC Software Corporation'',&lt;ref&gt;''Yue v. MSC Software Corporation'', Case No. 15-cv-5526-PJH  (N.D. Cal. 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
the Northern District of California held that the nominative fair use defense is a burden-shifting defense properly decided at the summary judgment stage and would be premature to raise in a motion to dismiss.

'''''Pax Americana'''''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye, Jr., "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2151022 The Changing Nature of World Power]". ''Political Science Quarterly'', The Academy of Political Science, Vol. 105, No. 2 (Summer, 1990), pp. 177–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal"&gt;''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science''. Philadelphia: Published by A.L. Hummel for the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 1917. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=xmkvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA40 Pax Americana]", George W. Kihchwey. pp. 40+.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lyman, Hamilton Wright Mabie, Ernest Hamlin Abbott, and Francis Rufus Bellamy. ''The Outlook''. New York: Outlook Co, 1898. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=rkUAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA465 Expansion not Imperialism]" p. 465. (''cf''. [...] Felix Adler [states ...] "if, instead of establishing the Pax Americana so far as our influence avails throughout this continent, we should enter into' the field of Old World strife, and seek the sort of glory that is written in human blood." Here it is assumed that we have failed in establishing self-government, and propose to substitute, at least in other lands, an Old World form of government. This sort of argument has no effect on the expansionist, because he believes that we have magnificently succeeded in our problem, in spite of failures, neglects, and violations of our own principles, and because what he wishes to do is, not to abandon the experiment, but, inspired by the successes of the past, extend the Pax Americana over lands not included in this continent.")&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin for "American Peace", modeled after ''[[Pax Romana]]'', ''[[Pax Britannica]]'', and ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'') is a term applied to the concept of relative [[peace]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and later the world beginning around the middle of the 20th century, thought to be caused by the preponderance of power enjoyed by the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Pax+Americana|title=Definition of PAX AMERICANA|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used with different meanings and eras, such as the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era in [[North America]],&lt;ref name="LalorCyclopaedia"&gt;Lalor, John J., ''Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States''. Chicago: Rand, McNally, 1884. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=OC0QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA959 The Union]", p. 959.&lt;/ref&gt; and regionally in the Americas at the start of the 20th century.

''Pax Americana'' is primarily used in its modern connotations to refer to the peace among [[great powers]] established after the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, also called [[Long Peace|the Long Peace]]. In this modern sense, it has come to indicate the military and economic position of the United States in relation to other nations.  For example, the [[Marshall Plan]], which spent $13 billion to rebuild the economy of Western Europe, has been seen as "the launching of the pax americana".&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Mee, ''The Marshall Plan: The launching of the pax americana'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term derives from ''[[Pax Romana]]'' of the [[Roman Empire]]. The term is most notably associated with ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' (1815–1914) under the [[British Empire]], which served as the global hegemon and constabulary from the late 18th century until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Harper's Magazine''. 1885. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=bPEvAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA413#v=onepage&amp;q=pax%20britannica&amp;f=false The Federal Union]", p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early period ==
{{Main|Gilded Age}}
{{See also|History of the United States (1865–1918)|Territorial changes of the United States|Overseas expansion of the United States}}
The first articulation of a ''Pax Americana'' occurred after the end of the [[American Civil War]] with reference to the peaceful nature of the North American geographical region, and was abeyant at the commencement of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Its emergence was concurrent with the development of the idea of [[American exceptionalism]]. This view holds that the U.S. occupies a special niche among [[developed nation]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html |title=sagehistory.net |publisher=sagehistory.net |date= |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629043938/http://sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html |archivedate=June 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of its national [[credo]], historical evolution, political and religious institutions, and unique origins. The concept originates from [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref name="politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225014354/http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-25|title=American Exceptionalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who asserted that the then-50-year-old United States held a special place among nations because it was a country of [[immigrants]] and the first [[modern democracy]]. From the establishment of the United States after the [[American Revolution]] until the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[foreign policy of the United States]] had a regional, instead of global, focus. The Pax Americana, which the Union enforced upon the states of central North America, was a factor in the United States' national [[prosperity]]. The larger states were surrounded by smaller states, but these had no anxieties: no standing armies to require taxes and hinder labor; no wars or rumors of wars that would interrupt trade; there is not only peace, but security, for the Pax Americana of the Union covered all the states within the [[Federation|federal]] constitutional republic.&lt;ref name="LalorCyclopaedia" /&gt; According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first time the phrase appeared in print was in the August 1894 issue of ''Forum'': "The true cause for exultation is the universal outburst of patriotism in support of the prompt and courageous action of President Cleveland in maintaining the supremacy of law throughout the length and breadth of the land, in establishing the ''pax Americana''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00344727?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Pax+Americana&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|title=Help – Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10kMiles.JPG|thumb|right|1898 [[political cartoon]]: "Ten Thousand Miles From Tip to Tip" meaning the extension of U.S. domination (symbolized by a [[bald eagle]]) from [[Puerto Rico]] to the [[Philippines]].]]
[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|1906 political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the Monroe Doctrine to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]].]]
With the [[rise of the New Imperialism#New Imperialism and the emerging empires|rise of the New Imperialism]] in the Western hemisphere at the end of the 19th century, debates arose between [[imperialism|imperialist]] and [[isolationism|isolationist]] factions in the U.S. Here, ''Pax Americana'' was used to connote the peace across the United States and, more widely, as a Pan-American peace under the aegis of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Those who favored traditional policies of avoiding foreign entanglements included labor leader [[Samuel Gompers]] and steel tycoon [[Andrew Carnegie]]. American politicians such as [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], [[William McKinley]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] advocated an aggressive foreign policy, but the administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]] was unwilling to pursue such actions. On January 16, 1893, U.S. diplomatic and military personnel conspired with a small group of individuals to [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow the constitutional government]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] and establish a [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government]] and then a [[Republic of Hawaii|republic]]. On February 15, they presented a treaty for annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but opposition to annexation stalled its passage. The United States finally opted to annex Hawaii by way of the [[Newlands Resolution]] in July 1898.

After its victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898 and the subsequent acquisition of [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Guam]], the United States had gained a [[colonial empire]]. By ejecting Spain from the Americas, the United States shifted its position to an uncontested regional power, and extended its influence into [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Although U.S. capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were relatively small, these colonies were strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia, particularly [[China]]. In the Caribbean area, the United States established a [[sphere of influence]] in line with the Monroe Doctrine, not explicitly defined as such, but recognized in effect by other governments and accepted by at least some of the republics in that area.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar"&gt;Kirkpatrick, F. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XtFCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 ''South America and the War'']: Being the Substance of a Course of Lectures Delivered in the University of London, King's College Under the Tooke Trust in the Lent Term, 1918. Cambridge [England]: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The events around the start of the 20th century demonstrated that the United States undertook an obligation, usual in such cases, of imposing a "Pax Americana".&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar" /&gt; As in similar instances elsewhere, this Pax Americana was not quite clearly marked in its geographical limit, nor was it guided by any theoretical consistency, but rather by the merits of the case and the test of immediate expediency in each instance.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar" /&gt; Thus, whereas the United States enforced a peace in much of the lands southward from the Nation and undertook measures to maintain internal tranquility in such areas, the United States on the other hand withdrew from interposition in Mexico.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar" /&gt;

European powers largely regarded these matters as the concern of the United States. Indeed, the nascent Pax Americana was, in essence, abetted by the policy of the United Kingdom, and the preponderance of global [[sea power]] which the [[British Empire]] enjoyed by virtue of the strength of the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Bernard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=m38uhldLcGsC ''Empire and Superempire: Britain, America and the World'']. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Preserving the [[freedom of the seas]] and ensuring naval dominance had been the policy of the British since victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. As it was not in the interests of the United Kingdom to permit any European power to interfere in Americas, the Monroe Doctrine was indirectly aided by the Royal Navy. British commercial interests in South America, which comprised a valuable component of the [[Informal Empire]] that accompanied Britain's imperial possessions, and the economic importance of the United States as a trading partner, ensured that intervention by Britain's rival European powers could not engage with the Americas.

The United States lost its Pacific and regionally bounded nature towards the end of the 19th century. The government adopted [[protectionism]] after the [[Spanish–American War]] and built up the navy, the "[[Great White Fleet]]", to expand the reach of U.S. power. When Theodore Roosevelt became [[President of the United States|President]] in 1901, he accelerated a foreign policy shift away from isolationism towards foreign intervention which had begun under his predecessor, [[William McKinley]]. The [[Philippine–American War]] arose from the ongoing [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html|author=John M. Gates|title=War-Related Deaths in the Philippines|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=53|issue=3|date=August 1984|pages=367–78|publisher=wooster.edu|accessdate=2014-07-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805061319/http://www3.wooster.edu/history/jgates/book-ch3.html|archivedate=2010-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interventionism found its formal articulation in the 1904 [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine, proclaiming the right of the United States to intervene in the affairs of weak states in the Americas in order to stabilize them, a moment that underlined the emergent U.S. regional [[hegemony]].

== Interwar period ==
{{Main|Interwar period}}
The United States had been criticized for not taking up the hegemonic mantle following the disintegration of ''Pax Britannica'' before the First World War and during the interwar period due to the absence of established political structures, such as the [[World Bank]] or [[United Nations]] which would be created after World War II, and various internal policies, such as protectionism.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Harold. The Interwar Depression in an International Context. München: R. Oldenbourg, 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe0E1BEzOOEC&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Little, Michael Smith, ''Perspectives on World Politics''. Routledge, 2006. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tWZN2Yos2mEC&amp;pg=PA365 Page 365].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northrup, Cynthia Clark. The American Economy: A Historical Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara, Calif: ABC-CLIO, 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3DE4P7NdaycC&amp;pg=PA135 Great Depression]'' pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Though, the United States participated in the Great War, according to Woodrow Wilson:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth insure the observance of those principles.&lt;br /&gt;
[...] for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:The Gap in the Bridge.png|thumbnail|left|The Gap in the Bridge. Cartoon about the absence of the U.S. from the League of Nations, depicted as the missing keystone of the arch.]]

The United States' entry into the Great War marked the abandonment of the traditional American policy of isolation and independence of world politics. Not at the close of the Civil War, not as the result of the Spanish War, but in the [[Interwar period]] did the United States become a part of the international system.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt; With this global reorganization from the Great War, there were those in the American populace that advocated an activist role in international politics and international affairs by the United States.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt; Activities that were initiated did not fall into political-military traps and, instead, focused on economic-ideological approaches that would increase the American Empire and general worldwide stability.&lt;ref name="ParchamiHegemonic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parchami|first=Ali|title=Hegemonic Peace and Empire: The Pax Romana, Britannica and Americana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQPEdl_cGHEC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=181|chapter=The Pax Americana Debate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the prior path, a precursor to the United Nations and a league to enforce peace, the League of Nations, was proposed by Woodrow Wilson.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt; This was rejected by the American Government in favor of more economic-ideological approaches and the United States did not join the League. Additionally, there were even proposals of extending the Monroe Doctrine to Great Britain put forth to prevent a second conflagration on the European theater.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; Ultimately, the United States' proposals and actions did not stop the factors of  European nationalism spawned by the previous war, the repercussions of Germany's defeat, and the failures of the Treaty of Versailles from plunging the globe into a Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John (1998), The First World War, Hutchinson, {{ISBN|0-09-180178-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between World War I and World War II, America also sought to continue to preserve ''Pax America'' as a [[corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy"&gt;Einstein, Lewis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gpUMAAAAYAAJ A Prophecy of the War (1913–1914)]. New York: Columbia University Press, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sought the peaceful and orderly evolution of existing conditions in the western hemisphere and nothing by immediate changes.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; Before 1917, the position of the United States government and the feelings of the nation in respect to the "Great War" initially had properly been one of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; Its interests remained untouched, and nothing occurred of a nature to affect those interests.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt;

The average American's sympathies, on the other hand, if the feelings of the vast majority of the nation had been correctly interpreted, was with the Allied (Entente) Powers.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; The population of the United States was revolted at the ruthlessness of the Prussian doctrine of war, and German designs to shift the burden of aggression encountered skeptical derision.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; The American populace saw themselves safeguarding liberal peace in the Western World. To this end, the American writer Roland Hugins stated:&lt;ref&gt;Roland Hugins, ''The Possible Peace'', New York, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The truth is that the United States is the only high-minded Power left in the world. It is the only strong nation that has not entered on a career of imperial conquest, and does not want to enter on it. [...] There is in America little of that spirit of selfish aggression which lies at the heart of militarism. Here alone exists a broad basis for "a new passionate sense of brotherhood, and a new scale of human values." We have a deep abhorrence of war for war's sake; we are not enamored of glamour or glory. We have a strong faith in the principle of self-government. We do not care to dominate alien peoples, white or colored; we do not aspire to be the Romans of tomorrow or the "masters of the world." The idealism of Americans centers in the future of America, wherein we hope to work out those principles of liberty and democracy to which we are committed This political idealism, this strain of pacifism, this abstinence from aggression and desire to be left alone to work out our own destiny, has been manifest from the birth of the republic. We have not always followed our light, but we have never been utterly faithless to it.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was observed during this time that the initial defeat of Germany opened a moral recasting of the world.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; The battles between Germans and Allies were seen as far less battles between different nations than they represent the contrast between [[Liberalism]] and [[reactionary|reaction]], between the aspirations of [[democracy]] and the [[Wilhelminism]] [[Blood and Iron (speech)|gospel of iron]].&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bismarck introduced this in the era of force.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern period ==
[[File:Superpower map 1945.png|240px|thumb|A world map of 1945 with three [[superpower]]s: the [[United States]] (in blue), the [[Soviet Union]] (in red), and the [[British Empire]] (in teal).]]

The modern ''Pax Americana'' era is cited by both supporters and critics of [[Foreign relations of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] after World War II. However, from 1946 to 1992 ''Pax americana'' is considered a partial international order, as it applied only to capitalist bloc countries, being preferable for some authors to speak about a ''Pax americana et sovietica''.&lt;ref&gt;Ibañez Muñoz, Josep, "El desafío a la Pax americana: del 11 de septiembre a la guerra de Irak" in C. García and A. J. Rodrigo (eds) "El imperio inviable. El orden internacional tras el conflicto de Irak", Madrid: Tecnos, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators and critics focus on American policies from 1992 to the present, and as such, it carries different connotations depending on the context. For example, it appears three times in the 90 page document, ''[[Project for the New American Century#Rebuilding America's Defenses|Rebuilding America's Defenses]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |title=Rebuilding America's Defenses Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century |publisher=Newamericancentury.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923154604/http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |archivedate=September 23, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Project for the New American Century]], but is also used by critics to characterize American dominance and [[hyperpower]] as imperialist in function and basis. From about the mid-1940s until 1991, U.S. foreign policy was dominated by the [[Cold War]], and characterized by its significant international military presence and greater diplomatic involvement. Seeking an alternative to the isolationist policies pursued after World War I, the United States defined a new policy called [[containment]] to oppose the spread of [[communism]].

The modern ''Pax Americana'' may be seen as similar to the period of peace in [[Roman Empire|Rome]], ''[[Pax Romana]]''. In both situations, the period of peace was 'relative peace'.  During both ''Pax Romana'' and ''Pax Americana'' wars continued to occur, but it was still a prosperous time for both Western and Roman civilizations. It is important to note that during these periods, and most other times of relative tranquility, the peace that is referred to does not mean complete peace.  Rather, it simply means that the civilization prospered in their [[military]], [[agriculture]], [[trade]], and [[manufacturing]].

=== ''Pax Britannica'' heritage ===
{{Main|Pax Britannica}}

From the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 until [[World War I]] in 1914, the [[United Kingdom]] played the role of [[Offshore balancing|offshore-balancer]] in Europe, where the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was the main aim. It was also in this time that the British Empire became the largest empire of all time.  The global superiority of [[British Armed Forces|British military]] and commerce was guaranteed by dominance of a Europe lacking in strong [[nation-state]]s, and the presence of the [[Royal Navy]] on all of the world's oceans and seas. In 1905, the Royal Navy was superior to any two navies combined in the world. It provided services such as suppression of [[piracy]] and [[slavery]]. In this era of peace, though, there were several wars between the major powers: the [[Crimean War]], the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]], the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], as well as numerous other wars. ''[[La Belle Époque]]'', [[William Wohlforth]] argued, was rather ''Pax Britannica'', ''Russica'' and later ''Germanica'', and between 1853 and 1871 it was not ''Pax'' of any kind.&lt;ref name="Unipolar World 1999 p 39"&gt;"The Stability of a Unipolar World,"' ''International Security'', 24/1, (1999): p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the British hegemony, America developed close ties with Britain, evolving into what has become known as a "[[special relationship]]" between the two. The many commonalities shared with the two nations (such as language and history) drew them together as allies. Under the managed transition of the British Empire to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], members of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]], such as [[Harold Macmillan]], liked to think of [[Anglo-American relations|Britain's relationship with America]] as similar to that of a progenitor [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] to America's [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2002/09/06/do0602.xml  Labour's love-in with America is nothing new] [[Daily Telegraph]] 6 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, both have been active in [[North America]]n, [[Middle East]]ern, and [[Asia]]n countries.

After the Second World War, no [[war|armed conflict]] emerged among major Western nations themselves, and no [[nuclear weapon]]s were used in open conflict.  The [[United Nations]] was also soon developed after World War II to help keep peaceful relations between nations and establishing the veto power for the permanent members of the [[UN Security Council]], which included the United States.

In the second half of the 20th century, the USSR and US superpowers were engaged in the Cold War, which can be seen as a struggle between hegemonies for global dominance. After 1945, the United States enjoyed an advantageous position with respect to the rest of the industrialized world. In the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]], the US was responsible for half of global industrial output, held 80 percent of the world's [[gold]] reserves, and was the world's sole [[list of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear power]]. The catastrophic destruction of life, infrastructure, and capital during the Second World War had exhausted the imperialism of the [[Old World]], victor and vanquished alike. The largest economy in the world at the time, the United States recognized that it had come out of the war with its domestic [[infrastructure]] virtually unscathed and its [[Military of the United States|military forces]] at unprecedented strength. Military officials recognized the fact that Pax Americana had been reliant on the effective United States [[air power]], just as the instrument of Pax Britannica a century earlier was its [[sea power]].&lt;ref&gt;Futrell, Robert Frank, "Ideas, Concepts, Doctrine: Basic Thinking in the United States Air Force 1907–1960".

The term ''Pax Americana'' was explicitly used by [[John F. Kennedy]] in the 1960s, who advocated against the idea, arguing that the Soviet bloc was composed of human beings with the same individual goals as Americans and that such a peace based on "American weapons of war" was undesirable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived. And that is the most important topic on earth: peace. What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a ''Pax Americana'' enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children—not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E.

Beginning around the [[Vietnam War]], the 'Pax Americana' term had started to be used by the critics of American Imperialism. Here in the late 20th century conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, the charge of ''[[Neocolonialism]]'' was often aimed at Western involvement in the affairs of the [[Third World]] and other developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Anuradha M.

Currently, the ''Pax Americana'' is based on the military preponderance beyond challenge by any combination of powers and projection of power throughout the world's ''commons''—neutral sea, air and space. This projection is coordinated by the [[Unified Command Plan]] which divides the world on regional branches controlled by a single command. Notably, "the right to command" translated into Latin renders ''imperium''. Integrated with it are global network of military alliances (the [[Rio Pact]], [[NATO]], [[ANZUS]] and bilateral alliances with Japan and several other states) coordinated by Washington in a hub-and-spokes system and worldwide network of several hundreds of military bases and installations. Neither the Rio Treaty, nor NATO, for [[Robert J. Art]], "was a regional collective security organization; rather both were regional imperia run and operated by the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Robert J., Art, "Geopolitics Updated: The Strategy of Selective Engagement", ''International Security'', 23/3 (1998–99), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Security Advisor Zbignew Brzezinski drew an expressive summary of the military foundation of ''Pax Americana'' shortly after the ''[[New world order (politics)|unipolar moment]]'':
{{quote|
In contrast [to the earlier empires], the scope and pervasiveness of American global power today are unique. Not only does the United States control all the world's oceans, its military legions are firmly perched on the western and eastern extremities of Eurasia&amp;nbsp;... American vassals and tributaries, some yearning to be embraced by even more formal ties to Washington, dot the entire Eurasian continent&amp;nbsp;... American global supremacy is&amp;nbsp;... buttered by an elaborate system of alliances and coalitions that literally span the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], ''[[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives]]'', (Perseus Books, New York, 1997, p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Besides the military foundation, there are significant non-military international institutions backed by American financing and diplomacy (like the [[United Nations]] and [[WTO]]). The United States invested heavily in programs such as the [[Marshall Plan]] and in the reconstruction of [[Japan]], economically cementing defense ties that owed increasingly to the establishment of the [[Iron Curtain]]/[[Eastern Bloc]] and the widening of the [[Cold War]].

Being in the best position to take advantage of free trade, culturally indisposed to traditional empires, and alarmed by the rise of [[communism]] in [[China]] and the detonation of the first Soviet [[atom bomb]], the historically [[Noninterventionism|non-interventionist]] U.S. also took a keen interest in developing multilateral institutions which would maintain a favorable world order among them. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (World Bank), part of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of [[international financial system|international financial management]] was developed and, until the early 1970s, the existence of a [[fixed exchange rate]] to the US dollar. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was developed and consists of a protocol for normalization and reduction of trade [[tariff]]s.

With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]], the demise of the notion of a ''[[Pax Sovietica]]'', and the end of the [[Cold War]], the U.S. maintained significant contingents of armed forces in Europe and [[East Asia]]. The institutions behind the Pax Americana and the rise of the United States unipolar power have persisted into the early 21st century. The ability of the United States to act as "the world's [[police]]man" has been constrained by its own citizens' historic aversion to foreign wars.&lt;ref&gt;Westerfield, H. Bradford. ''The Instruments of America's Foreign Policy''. New York: Crowell, 1963. p. 138. (''cf''. "the traditional American aversion to foreign wars, but also related to some recent disillusionment with the fruits of total wars&amp;nbsp;...")&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been calls for the continuation of military leadership, as stated in "Rebuilding America's Defenses":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The American peace has proven itself peaceful, stable, and durable. It has, over the past decade, provided the geopolitical framework for widespread economic growth and the spread of American principles of liberty and democracy. Yet no moment in international politics can be frozen in time; even a global ''Pax Americana'' will not preserve itself. [... What is required is] a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and national leadership that accepts the United States' global responsibilities.&lt;ref name=RAD2000&gt;{{Cite news

This is reflected in the research of American exceptionalism, which shows that "there is some indication for [being a leader of an 'American peace'] among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of [[unilateral]] attitudes".&lt;ref name="politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de" /&gt; It should be noted that resentments have arisen at a country's dependence on American military protection, due to disagreements with United States foreign policy or the presence of American military forces.
In the ''[[post-communism]]'' world of the 21st-century, the French Socialist politician and former Foreign Minister [[Hubert Védrine]] describes the US as a hegemonic [[hyperpower]], while the U.S. political scientists [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Joseph Nye]] counter that the US is not a "true" hegemony, because it does not have the resources to impose a proper, formal, global rule; despite its political and military strength, the US is economically equal to Europe, thus, cannot rule the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Sr., ''Understanding International Conflicts: An introduction to Theory and History'', pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries are either emerging or re-emerging as powers, such as [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of India|India]], and the [[European Union]].

Joseph Nye discredited the United States as not a "true" hegemony in his 2002 article titled "The New Rome Meets the New Barbarians".&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', 23/3, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}} His book of the same year he opens: "Not since Rome has one nation loomed so large above the others."&lt;ref&gt;''The Paradox of American Power'', (Oxford University Press, New York, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; And his 1991 book he titled ''Bound to Lead''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bound To Lead: The Changing Nature Of American Power'' (Basic Books, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leadership'', translated into Greek, renders ''[[hegemony]]''; an alternative translation is ''archia'' – Greek common word for ''empire''. Having defined the US hegemony as "not true", Nye looks for an analogy to the true empire: Decline, he writes, is not necessarily imminent. "Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the peak of its power&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2010-11-01/future-american-power The Future of American Power: Dominance and Decline in Perspective]", ''Foreign Affairs'' (November–December  2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there are striking parallels with the early ''Pax Romana'' (especially between 189 BC when the supremacy over the Mediterranean was won and the first annexation in 168 BC). Under that ''Pax Romana'' other states remained formally independent and very seldom were called "clients". The latter term became widely used only in the late medieval period. Usually, other states were called "friends and allies"—a popular expression under the ''Pax Americana''.

One of the first to use the term ''Pax Americana'' was the [[Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy]]. In 1942, the Committee envisaged that the United States may have to replace the British Empire. Therefore, the United States "must cultivate a mental view toward world settlement after this war which will enable us to impose our own terms, amounting perhaps to a Pax Americana".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Michio Kaku and David Axelrod, ''To Win a Nuclear War: The Pentagon Secret War Plans'', Boston: South End Press, 1987, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swen Holdar, the founder of [[geopolitics]] [[Rudolf Kjellen]] (1864–1922) predicted the era of US global supremacy using the term ''Pax Americana'' shortly after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ideal State and the Power of Geography. The Life Work of Rudolf Kjellen", ''Political Geography Quarterly'', 11/3 (1992): p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|reason=What is this "11/3"? A date? Who wrote it?|date=July 2018}} Writing in 1945, [[Ludwig Dehio]] remembered that the Germans used the term ''Pax Anglosaxonica'' in a sense of Pax Americana since 1918:
{{quote|
Now [1918] the [American colonial] cutting had grown into a tree that bade fair to overshadow the globe with its foliage. Amazed and shaken, we Germans began to discuss the possibility of a Pax Anglosaxonica as a world-wide counterpart to the Pax Romana. Suddenly the tendency toward global unification towered up, ready to gather the separate national states of Europe together under one banner and blanket in a larger cohesion&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Dehio, ''The Precarious Balance: Four Centuries of the European Power Struggle'', 1945 (tr. Fullman, Charles, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1962), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The United States, Dehio associates on the same page, withdrew to isolation on that occasion. "Rome, too, had taken a long time to understand the significance of her world role." Two years earlier, with the war still at its peak, the founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], invoked the example of the two-centuries long "Pax Romana" which, he suggested, could be repeated if based on the preponderant US air power:
{{quote|
During the third century BC the Mediterranean world was divided on five great powers—Roma and Carthage, Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt. The balance of power led to a series of wars until Rome emerged the queen of the Mediterranean and established an incomparable era of two centuries of peace and progress, the 'Pax Romana'&amp;nbsp;... It may be that America's air power could again assure our world, now much smaller than the Mediterranean at that period, two hundred years of peace&amp;nbsp;... This is the only realistic hope for a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;''Crusade for Pan-Europe'' (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1943), pp. 299–304.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One of the first criticisms of "Pax Americana" was written by [[Nathaniel Peffer]] in 1943:
{{quote|
It is neither feasible nor desirable&amp;nbsp;... Pax Americana can be established and maintained only by force, only by means of a new, gigantic imperialism operating with the instrumentalities of militarism and the other concomitants of imperialism&amp;nbsp;... The way to dominion is through empire and the price of dominion is empire, and empire generates its own opposition.&lt;ref&gt;"America’s Place in the Postwar World", ''Political Science Quarterly'', 58/1 (1943): pp. 12, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|reason=What is "58/1"? Who is the author?|date=July 2018}}}}
However, Peffer was not certain that this would not happen: "It is conceivable that&amp;nbsp;... America might drift into empire, imperceptibly, stage by stage, in a kind of power-politics gravitation." He also noted that America was heading precisely in that direction: "That there are certain stirrings in this direction is apparent, though how deep they go is unclear."&lt;ref&gt;"America’s Place in the Postwar World", ''op. cit.'', pp. 12, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depth soon became clarified. Two later critics of Pax Americana, [[Michio Kaku]] and [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], interpreted the outcome of Pax Americana: "[[Gunboat diplomacy]] would be replaced by Atomic diplomacy. [[Pax Britannica]] would give way to Pax Americana." After the war, with the German and British militaries in tatters, only one force stood on the way to Pax Americana: the Red Army.&lt;ref name="To Win a Nuclear War, p 64"&gt;''To Win a Nuclear War'', ''op. cit.'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after this criticism was written, the Red Army withdrew, paving the way for the [[Unipolarity|unipolar moment]]. [[Joshua Muravchik]] commemorated the event by titling his 1991 article, "At Last, Pax Americana". He detailed:
{{quote|
Last but not least, the Gulf War marks the dawning of the Pax Americana. True, that term was used immediately after World War II. But it was a misnomer then because the Soviet empire—a real competitor with American power—was born at the same moment. The result was not a "pax" of any kind, but a cold war and a bipolar world&amp;nbsp;... During the past two years, however, Soviet power has imploded and a bipolar world has become unipolar.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Muravchick, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/24/opinion/at-last-pax-americana.html At Last, Pax Americana]", ''The New York Times'' (January 24, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following year, in 1992, a US strategic draft for the post-Cold War period was leaked to the press. The person responsible for the confusion, former Assistant Secretary of State, [[Paul Wolfowitz]], confessed seven years later: "In 1992 a draft memo prepared by my office at the Pentagon&amp;nbsp;... leaked to the press and sparked a major controversy." The draft's strategy aimed "to prevent any hostile power from dominating" a Eurasian region "whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power". He added: "Senator Joseph Biden ridiculed the proposed strategy as 'literally a ''Pax Americana''&amp;nbsp;... It won't work&amp;nbsp;...' Just seven years later, many of these same critics seem quite comfortable with the idea of a ''Pax Americana''."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wolfowitz, "Remembering the Future", ''National Interest'', 59: (2000), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War period, concluded [[William Wohlforth]], much less ambiguously deserves to be called ''Pax Americana''. "Calling the current period the true Pax Americana may offend some, but it reflects reality".&lt;ref name="Unipolar World 1999 p 39" /&gt;

The ‘’Pax Americana’’ motif reached its peak in the context of the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. The phrase "American Empire" appeared in one thousand news stories over a single six-month period in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Go, ''Patterns of Empire: The British and American Empires, 1688 to the Present'' (New York: Cambridge University Press,  2011), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Freedland]] observed:

{{American Empire}}

''American imperialism'' is a term referring to outcomes or ideological elements of United States foreign policy. Since the start of the [[cold war]], the United States has economically and/or diplomatically supported friendly foreign governments, including many that overtly violated the civil and human rights of their own citizens and residents.  American imperialism concepts were initially a product of capitalism critiques and, later, of theorists opposed to what they take to be aggressive United States policies and doctrines. Although there are various views of the imperialist nature of the United States, which describe many of the same policies and institutions as evidence of imperialism, explanations for imperialism vary widely. In spite of such literature, the historians Archibald Paton Thorton and Stuart Creighton Miller argue against the very coherence of the concept. Miller argues that the overuse and abuse of the term "imperialism" makes it nearly meaningless as an analytical concept.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Stuart Creighton  | title="Benevolent Assimilation" The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899–1903 | publisher=Yale University Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-300-02697-8 | url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/bailey83221/4300.html#miller}} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peer victimization''' is the experience among children of being a target of the [[aggressive]] behavior of other children, who are not siblings and not necessarily age-mates.&lt;ref name=twenty&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawker | first1 = David S.J. | last2 = Boulton | first2 = Michael J. | title = Twenty years' research on peer victimization and psychosocial maladjustment: a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies | journal = [[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 441–455 | doi = 10.1111/1469-7610.00629 | date = May 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background/overview==
Mass interest in the issue of peer victimization arose during the 1990s due to media coverage of student [[suicide]]s, peer beatings, and [[school shootings]], notably [[Columbine High School massacre|the tragedy]] in [[Columbine, Colorado]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seeley | first1 = Ken | last2 = Tombari | first2 = Martin L. | last3 = Bennett | first3 = Laurie J. | last4 = Dunkle | first4 = Jason B. | title = Peer victimization in schools: a set of quantitative and qualitative studies of the connections among peer victimization, school engagement, truancy, school achievement, and other outcomes | journal = National Center for School Engagement | volume = 1 | pages = 13–46 | id = NCJ 234135 | date = July 2009 | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=256074 | ref = harv }} [http://schoolengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PeerVictimizationinSchoolsAsetofQualitativeandQuantitativeStudies1.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an explosion of research attempting to assess [[bullying|bully]]-victim relationships and related players, what leads victims to experience negative outcomes and how widespread this problem was. Studies of peer victimization have also been conducted in the context of research investigating childhood relationships in general and how they are associated with school adjustment and achievement.

Research has proven the problematic nature of peer victimization, identifying many negative outcomes such as low [[self-esteem]], low school engagement, school avoidance, lower school achievement, [[learned helplessness]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt; Peer victimization is especially prevalent and damaging in [[middle school]], as during this time children are defining themselves by creating [[self-schema]]s and establishing self-esteem, both which will impact their future adult life; for this reason, most of the research on peer victimization focuses on this age group. They are also more vulnerable to peer rejection because needs for belonging and intimacy may be especially strong during early adolescence, when children are working to solidify their peer groups.&lt;ref name =G&amp;M&gt;{{citation | last1 = Gottman | first1 = John M. | last2 = Mettetal | first2 = Gwendolyn | contribution = Speculations about social and affective development: friendship and acquaintanceship through adolescence | editor-last1 = Gottman | editor-first1 = John M. | editor-last2 = Parker | editor-first2 = Jeffrey G. | title = Conversations of friends: speculations on affective development | pages = 192–237 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location =  New York, New York | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780521263214 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Retrieved from www.csa.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite book | last = Sullivan | first = Harry Stack | title = The interpersonal theory of psychiatry | publisher = Norton | location = New York | year = 2013 | origyear = 1953 | isbn = 9781136439292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of victimization research adopts a [[social psychology]] perspective, investigating how different types of peer victimization affect the individual and the different negative outcomes that occur. Some experimenters are adopting the term social victimization in order to acknowledge that victimization can take both verbal and nonverbal forms or be direct or indirect. They mostly focus on the types of victimization that can occur from multiple sources in a particular environment. [[Personality psychology|Personality psychologists]] look at individual differences and effects in victims. They may also study individuals in a social context, determining which are more likely to be victimized, such as those who are socially withdrawn.

With the development of technology and the widespread access it gives to children and teenagers, peer victimization has become more prevalent through the Internet and cell phones than in years past.&lt;ref name=S&amp;O&amp;S&amp;C&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = Shari Kessel | last2 = O'Donnell | first2 = Lydia | last3 = Stueve | first3 = Ann | last4 = Coulter | first4 = Robert W.S. | title = Cyberbullying, school bullying, and psychological distress: a regional census of high school students | journal = [[American Journal of Public Health]] | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 171–177 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300308 | pmc = 3490574 | date = January 2012 | ref = harv | pmid=22095343}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of victimization called [[cyberbullying]] has a potential for a much wider audience than traditional face-to-face victimization.&lt;ref name="S&amp;O&amp;S&amp;C"/&gt; It is also easier to hide from parents and teachers. Studies have found that because this form of victimization is done through the anonymity of the Internet or text messaging, bullies feel more comfortable being crueler to the victim.&lt;ref name=C&amp;C&amp;L&amp;M&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chesney | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Coyne | first2 = Iain | last3 = Logan | first3 = Brian | last4 = Madden | first4 = Neil | title = Griefing in virtual worlds: causes, casualties and coping strategies | journal = [[Information Systems Journal]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 525–548 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2009.00330.x | date = November 2009 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without face-to-face communication, social standards become less important and behavior becomes less inhibited.&lt;ref name="C&amp;C&amp;L&amp;M"/&gt;

==Major theoretical approaches==

===Operational definitions===
Originally, researchers focused on overt forms of [[victimization]], which were categorized as either physical or verbal.&lt;ref name=Storch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Storch | first1 = Eric A. | last2 = Masia-Warner | first2 = Carrie | last3 = Crisp | first3 = Heather | last4 = Klein | first4 = Rachel G. | title = Peer victimization and social anxiety in adolescence: a prospective study | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 437–452 | doi = 10.1002/ab.20093 | date = October 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ab.10047 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, researchers such as [[Nicki R. Crick]] argued for the existence of a more covert form of victimization which she observed primarily among females that she called [[Relational aggression|relational victimization]], during which a child’s social relationships and social standing are attacked via methods such as peer exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crick | first = Nicki R. (director) | title = Relational and overt aggression, peer victimization, social information processing, and gender | location = Nashville | publisher = Vanderbilt University | date = February 24, 2011 }} Lecture conducted from Vanderbilt University, Nashville.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, victimization is largely operationally defined as either covert/relational victimization or overt/physical victimization, in which a child is threatened with or dealt corporeal damage.&lt;ref name=C&amp;M&amp;D&amp;Y&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cole | first1 = David A. | last2 = Maxwell | first2 = Melissa A. | last3 = Dukewich | first3 = Tammy L. | last4 = Yosick | first4 = Rachel | title = Targeted peer victimization and the construction of positive and negative self-cognitions: connections to depressive symptoms in children | journal = Journal of Clinical Child &amp; Adolescent Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–435 | doi = 10.1080/15374411003691776 | pmid = 20419582 | date = April 2010 | ref = harv | pmc = 4300522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research approaches and theories===
The study of peer victimization draws from two major strands of research as identified by Seely, Tombari, Bennett &amp; Dunkle (2009) &lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt; called the "[[bullying]] strand" and the "peer relationship strand." The victimization aspect of the "bullying strand" focuses on what leads victims to disengage from school and suffer from damaging negative outcomes while others adjust. The peer relationship strand is more quantitatively oriented, studying fundamental factors related to peer victimization and the negative outcomes, paying special attention to what factors mediate the relationship between them. Interest in peer victimization in psychological research has been fairly recent, and therefore it appears that most researchers have drawn from other areas of study and contemporary applied theories to the context of peer victimization.

The areas of the bullying strand that specifically pertain to peer victimization are studies of victimization prevalence, victims’ home environment, and effects of victimization in schools . Researchers started by determining the prevalence of peer victimization believing this would allow for the comparison of the problem over time, populations and after interventions.&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt;&lt;ref name=S&amp;O&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solberg | first1 = Mona E. | last2 = Olweus | first2 = Dan | title = Prevalence estimation of school bullying with the Olweus Bully/Victim questionnaire | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–268 | doi = 10.1002/ab.10047 | date = June 2003 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevalence research has been conducted in many different countries, cultures and classroom contexts. Studies utilize a variety of different methods such as self-report questionnaires, peer nominations, and teacher nominations have been used.&lt;ref name=C&amp;M&amp;D&amp;Y /&gt; Unfortunately, results show that in many contexts, the percentage of children that are victimized have fallen in a range between 5-90%&lt;ref name=R&amp;G&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roland | first1 = Erling | last2 = Galloway | first2 = David | title = Professional cultures in schools with high and low rates of bullying | journal = School Effectiveness and School Improvement: An International Journal of Research, Policy and Practice | volume = 15 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 241–260 | doi = 10.1080/09243450512331383202 | date = September 2004 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E&amp;A&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Espelage | first1 = Dorothy L. | last2 = Asidao | first2 = Christine S. | title = Conversations with middle school students about bullying and victimization: Should we be concerned? | journal = [[Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma|Journal of Emotional Abuse]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 49–62 | doi = 10.1300/J135v02n02_04 | date = March 2001 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying strand research also focuses on the type of families that those who are victimized come from and what types of parenting styles they experienced&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt; Finally, a limited number of studies today focus on impacts of being bullied in a school setting and how it relates to achievement, truancy, and drop-out.&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt;

Studies examining peer victimization have also been conducted in the context of a body of research interested in peer relationships and how they affect educational performance and adjustment; this is identified as the "peer relationship strand." In the 1970s and 1980s, Steven Asher identified one form of a relationship—peer victimization—as a predictor of educational maladjustment. Later, a new perspective formed that considered peer victimization as a type of relationship existing on a continuum of relationship roles from healthy relations to detrimental ones instead of focusing on specific bully-victim relationships. Experimenters have also been interested in how early victimization effects individuals over time, focusing on school-related outcomes. Studies have largely worked to identify underlying factors that mediate negative outcomes.

To account for difference in the severity of negative outcomes as a result of peer victimization, researchers have utilized theories of implicit peer relationships. In order to understand the social world, individuals create implicit theories about their social interactions&lt;ref name =D&amp;L&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dweck | first1 = Carol S. | last2 = Leggett | first2 = Ellen L. | title = A social-cognitive approach to motivation and personality | journal = [[Psychological Review]] | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 256–273 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.95.2.256 | date = April 1988 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.583.9142 }} [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e-reserves/regenstein/timp/232-2965.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;D&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molden | first1 = Daniel C. | last2 = Dweck | first2 = Carol S. | title = Finding "meaning" in psychology: a lay theories approach to self-regulation, social perception, and social development | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 192–203 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.61.3.192 | pmid = 16594836 | date = April 2006 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.319.5686 }} [https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/Finding%20%22meaning%22%20in%20Psychology.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; A major determinant of how a person handles social evaluation is the degree to which they ascribe entity theories of personality, believing it their attributes are stable and unalterable or incremental theories of personality, viewing attributes as pliable able to be augmented&lt;ref name=D&amp;H&amp;C&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dweck | first1 = Carol S. | last2 = Hong | first2 = Ying yi | last3 = Chiu | first3 = Chi yue | title = Implicit theories: Individual differences in the likelihood and meaning of dispositional inference | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 644–656 | doi = 10.1177/0146167293195015 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who adopt entity theories of personality often pursue performance oriented goals, seeking to accrue positive and avoid negative evaluations of their competence. Since they view their attributes as constant, it is vital that they are desirable in order for them to maintain a positive self-image. People who hold incremental theories of personality endeavor towards mastery-oriented goals, focusing on learning and cultivating competence since as they believe their attributes are malleable. Accordingly, they should feel less threatened by others’ evaluations of their competence. When thinking about self-evaluation, implicit theories should affect the degree to which children base their self appraisals on peer judgements, determining whether negative social interactions undermine their well-being.

In regards to behavioral reactions to victimization, research has identified two categories of characteristic responses.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = David | last2 = McFadyen-Ketchum | first2 = Steven A. | last3 = Dodge | first3 = Kenneth A. | last4 = Pettit | first4 = Greg S. | last5 = Bates | first5 = John E. | title = Peer group victimization as a predictor of children's behavior problems at home and in school | journal = [[Development and Psychopathology]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–99 | pmid = 9524809 | date = March 1998 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=43521&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S095457949800131X | ref = harv | doi=10.1017/s095457949800131x}}&lt;/ref&gt; One contains externalizing behaviors such as aggression, disruptive, antisocial, and acting out behaviors (Achenbach, 1966). Another constitutes internalizing behaviors like inhibited, anxious, or heightened withdrawal.&lt;ref name=A&amp;E&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Achenbach | first1 = Thomas M. | last2 = Edelbrock | first2 = Craig S. | title = The classification of child psychopathology: A review and analysis of empirical efforts | journal = [[Psychological Bulletin]] | volume = 85 | issue = 6 | pages = 1275–1301 | pmid = 366649 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.85.6.1275 | date = November 1978 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawker and Boulton (2001) have used the [[rank theory of depression]] to explain the relationship between forms of victimization and types of maladjustment.&lt;ref name=H&amp;B&gt;{{citation | last1 = Hawker | first1 = David S.J. | last2 = Boulton | first2 = Michael J. | contribution =  Subtypes of peer harassment and their correlates: A social dominance perspective | editor-last1 = Juvonen | editor-first1 = Jaana | editor-last2 = Graham | editor-first2 = Sandra | title = Peer harassment in school: the plight of the vulnerable and victimized | pages = 378–397 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781572306271 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rank theory, internalizing problems such as depression are linked to a sense of powerlessness and of not belonging. Those who are physically victimized suffer from low resource-holding potential, which works in part to delineate social power in peer groups, while relational victimization directly affects children’s sense of belonging instead. In addition, according to [[social rank theory]], jeopardization of one’s feeling of belonging stemming from relational victimization should play a greater part in perpetuating depression than that of resource-holding potential as in physical victimization. Therefore, depression should correlate more strongly with relational victimization as opposed to physical victimization.

Currently, researchers have become interested in the direction of the relationship between peer victimization and psychosocial adjustment.&lt;ref name=Storch /&gt; Many believe that the relation acts in a single direction: either peer victimization leads to maladjustment, or the relationship is reversed&lt;ref name=Bond&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = Lyndal | last2 = Carlin | first2 = John B. | last3 = Thomas | first3 = Lyndal | last4 = Rubin | first4 = Kerryn | last5 = Patton | first5 = George | title = Does bullying cause emotional problems?

==Empirical findings==
A study by Cole, Maxwell, Dukewich &amp; Yosick examined how physical and relational Targeted Peer Victimization (TPV) victimization were related and measured their effects on different types of positive and negative cognitions. It was hypothesized that the link between peer victimization and depression was mediated by the creation of negative self-schemas.&lt;ref name=C&amp;M&amp;D&amp;Y /&gt; The study found gender differences in victimization, as Relational TPV was more common for girls and physical TPV was more common for boys. Also, children who were severely victimized exhibited less positive self-cognitions and more negative self-cognitions as well as more depressive symptoms. Yet when they controlled for the effects of relational TPV, the effects of physical TPV disappeared; it appears that relational TPV is more strongly associated with these outcomes and an investigation of physical TPV alone would not yield the same associations. Positive and negative self-cognitions were found to mediate the effect of relational victimization to symptoms of depression.

Another study by Sinclair (2011) examined the relationship between physical and relational peer victimization with negative and positive self-cognitions as well. It was found that both types of victimization led to increases in negative self-cognitions and decreases in positive self-cognitions, though the effects were more pronounced when a child experienced relational victimization.&lt;ref name=Sinclair&gt;{{cite thesis |degree= M.Sc. |last= Sinclair |first= Keneisha Rachelle |date= March 2011 |title= Impact of physical and relational victimization on self-cognitions in children and adolescents |publisher= [[Vanderbilt University]] | url = http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03222011-154741/ | oclc = 710983846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While girls were found experienced more relational victimization than boys did and boys experienced more physical victimization than girls did, the negative effects of victimization on self-cognitions was stronger in boys. This may be due to one of their findings that boys are less likely to seek adult social support than girls are. A study conducted by Schmidt and Bagwell used surveys to gauge the reactions of victimization and their self evaluated friendships. The study found that girls benefited significantly from having stronger, reliable peer friendships in coping with victimization, while boys did not.&lt;ref name=S&amp;D&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = Michelle B. | last2 = Bagwell | first2 = Catherine L. | title = The protective role of friendhsips in overtly and relationally victimized boys and girls | journal = Merrill-Palmer Quarterly | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 439–460 | date = July 2007 | jstor = 23096128 | ref = harv | doi=10.1353/mpq.2007.0021}} [http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/mpq/vol53/iss3/7/ Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Snyder and colleagues studied 266 Kindergarten and first grade children in cases of observed victimization at school. The researchers hypothesized that children with higher recorded cases of victimization during recess would rank higher in antisocial and depressive behavior—according to parents and teachers—than those who do not.&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snyder | first1 = James | last2 = Brooker | first2 = Monica | last3 = Patrick | first3 = M.

Research seems to show that there is drastic difference in the way both genders (at least in children) respond to victimization from peers. Current studies on children indicate that regardless of observational method (researcher direct observation or survey results given to the children) there is a marked effect of victimization, especially from peers. The magnitude of the effect on their behavior and mental health is heavily correlated with the situation of the victimization and the child’s social environment at the time.

Schwartz et al. (1998) investigated the role of victimization in the development of children’s behavior problems, focusing on both internalizing and externalizing problems. They hypothesized that higher levels of victimization would lead to increased level of behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt; Child behavior was reported by teachers and parents, measured using the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], and peer victimization was measured using peer nomination. Indeed, they found that peer victimization in middle childhood was associated with behavioral maladjustment on both a concurrent and prospective basis. Additionally, externalizing behaviors were more strongly associated with victimization than were internalizing behaviors.

Seals &amp; Young (2003) investigated relationships between bullying and victimization with gender, grade level, ethnicity, self-esteem, and depression. Results showed that victims reported lower levels of self-esteem than did bullies and nonbullies/nonvictims. Additionally, victims had the highest depression scores as compared to bullies and nonbullies/nonvictims.&lt;ref name=S&amp;Y&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seals | first1 = Dorothy | last2 = Young | first2 = Jerry | title = Bullying and victimization: prevalence and relationship to gender, grade level, ethnicity, self-esteem, and depression | journal = [[Adolescence (magazine)|Adolescence]] | volume = 38 | issue = 152 | pages = 735–747 | pmid = 15053498 | date = Winter 2003 | url = https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-114740934/bullying-and-victimization-prevalence-and-relationship | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research progress has also been made into recent mediums of victimization and bullying, notably online victimization. A study conducted by Mitchell ''et al.'' in 2007 collected data from over 2000 adolescents through telephone interviews. The most surprising finding was that those who reported being subject to online victimization in the past year are 96% likely to also report being subject to physical (offline) victimization.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = Kimberly J. | last2 = Ybarra | first2 = Michele | last3 = Finkelhor | first3 = David | title = The relative importance of online victimization in understanding depression, delinquency, and substance use | journal = [[Child Maltreatment (journal)|Child Maltreatment]] | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 314–324 | doi = 10.1177/1077559507305996 | pmid = 17954938 | date = November 2007 | ref = harv }} [http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV132.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another study conducted with over 3000 youth in the 5th, 8th and 11th grades using surveys concluded that Internet victimization shares common causal pathways with physical and verbal victimization.&lt;ref name=W&amp;G&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Kirk R. | last2 = Guerra | first2 = Nancy G. | title = Prevalence and predictors of internet bullying | journal = [[Journal of Adolescent Health]] | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = S14–S21 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.018 | pmid = 18047941 | date = December 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
An interest in aspects of bullying sprouted in the 1990s due to media coverage of student suicides, peer beatings, and school shootings.&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt; Yet such negative outcomes are rare.

One of the most well-known cases concerning the effects of peer victimization is the [[Columbine High School massacre]] of 1999 in [[Columbine, Colorado|Columbine]], [[Colorado]], [[United States]]. The perpetrators of this incident, [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], murdered 12 students and 1 teacher and also injured 21 other students before committing suicide. After the tragedy, details emerged showing that Harris and Klebold had been bullied for years by classmates, with little to no intervention by school officials. Though such events are not frequent, they do alarming damage.

There has been a recent surge in the number of incidents regarding [[Gay bashing|peer victimization and homosexuality]]. Specifically, the news has recently highlighted many cases of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) students who have committed suicide in response to peer victimization. One such incident is the case of 18-year-old [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]], a Rutgers University student who was secretly videotaped by his roommate, [[Dharun Ravi]], having sexual intercourse with another man. Ravi and another hallmate also streamed the video of the sexual encounter online. After finding out about this, Clementi jumped off of the [[George Washington Bridge]] to his death. Reports claim that Clementi had filed a complaint about his roommate having previously violating his privacy in the same manner, but no action had been taken to replace Clementi’s roommate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Research demonstrates that lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) students are highly likely to be victimized.&lt;ref name=D&amp;P&amp;H&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = D'Augelli | first1 = Anthony R. | last2 = Pilkington | first2 = Neil W. | last3 = Hershberger | first3 = Scott L. | title = Incidence and mental health impact of sexual orientation victimization of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths in high school | journal = [[School Psychology Quarterly]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 148–167 | doi = 10.1521/scpq.17.2.148.20854 | date = Summer 2002 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of LGB participants were verbally abused when they were in high school, and 11% were physically assaulted in a study by D’Augelli et al. (2002). Negative outcomes such as mental health problems and poor school performance have been associated with high incidences of victimization of LGB students.&lt;ref name=H&amp;D&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hershberger | first1 = Scott L. | last2 = D'Augelli | first2 = Anthony R. | title = The impact of victimization on the mental health and suicidality of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths | journal = Developmental Psychology, Special Issue: Sexual Orientation and Human Development | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–74 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.65 | date = January 1995 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;B&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murdock | first1 = Tamera B. | last2 = Bolch | first2 = Megan B. | title = Risk and protective factors for poor school adjustment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) high school youth: Variable and person-centered analyses | journal = [[Psychology in the Schools]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–172 | doi = 10.1002/pits.20054 | date = February 2005 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently research in this area seems to be progressing from the investigation of the extent and effects of LGB victimization to the specific factors associated with victimization and negative outcomes.

A study by Goodenow et al. (2006) was one of the first to examine which school-related factors were associated with lower rates of victimization and suicidality in this population. School related factors included the presence of LGB support groups and staff support as well as other school characteristics like student-to-teacher ratio.&lt;ref name=Goodenow&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goodenow | first1 = Carol | last2 = Szalacha | first2 = Laura | last3 = Westheimer | first3 = Kim | title = School support groups, other school factors, and the safety of sexual minority adolescents | journal = [[Psychology in the Schools]] | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 573–589 | doi = 10.1002/pits.20173 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that LGB support groups were associated with both low victimization and suicidality among LGB students. Results indicated that the existence of LGB support groups may have led to a decrease in suicidality through decreasing incidence of peer victimization as the association between LGB support groups and suicidality disappeared when victimization was controlled for. Yet as this study examined correlations, causality cannot be assumed. Student courts were associated with less victimization, and antibullying policies were associated with less suicidality, even when the effects of victimization and perceived support were taken into account. Lower levels of victimization and suicidality of LGB students was also associated with large school size and urban locale. These school-related factors have traditionally been associated with a generally safer school environment, yet it seems that factors that increase safety for the general population may not increase safety for LGB students.

A study by Kosciw et al. (2009) investigated how school related factors, community factors (such as adult education and income level), and locational factors (on a national level) were associated with victimization of LGB students.&lt;ref name=Kosciw&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kosciw | first1 = Joseph G. | last2 = Greytak | first2 = Emily A. | last3 = Diaz | first3 = Elizabeth M. | title = Who, what, where, when, and why: demographic and ecological factors contributing to hostile school climate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 976–988 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-009-9412-1 | date = August 2009 | ref = harv | pmid=19636740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed that community factors were the most significantly related to victimization and many regional-level as well as school-related factors were not found to be significant once these factors were taken into account. Increased reports of victimization due to gender expression were found in communities with higher poverty levels compared to affluent communities. Youth from communities with higher as opposed to lower proportions of adults with college degrees also reported less victimization. In accordance with the Goodenow study, It was also found that youth from urban communities were less likely to be victimized than those from rural communities.

==Applications==
The results of these studies show a strong need for intervention programs, specifically in-school programs. Though most schools punish bullying through disciplinary action, the frequency of bullying and victimization remains high. Thus, newer, more effective strategies must be implemented. Such programs should not only focus on punishing the bully, but should also focus on the victim. Victims should be taught to use healthier coping strategies instead of internalizing and externalizing their feelings. One intervention program focuses on bullying prevention in positive behavior support (BP-PBS). BP-PBS is designed to, in a series of steps, teach students how to treat each other respectfully, as well as teach ways to minimize social reinforcement of bullying behaviors in order to improve the school atmosphere.

Ross and Horner (2009) investigated the effectiveness of this program across three elementary schools in Oregon by focusing on 6 students.&lt;ref name=R&amp;H&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = Scott W. | last2 = Horner | first2 = Robert H. | editor-last1 = Higbee Action | editor-first1 = Thomas | title = Bully prevention in positive behavior support | journal = [[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]] | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 747–759 | doi = 10.1901/jaba.2009.42-747 | date = Winter 2009 | ref = harv | pmid=20514181 | pmc=2791686}} Also see: [https://www.pbis.org/common/cms/files/pbisresources/bullyprevention_ES.pdf handbook.]&lt;/ref&gt; They collected baseline data for the frequency of bullying as well as victim and bystander responses and then implemented the program across these school for approximately 8–12 weeks. Results showed that the frequency of bullying behaviors was significantly reduced among these students and that there was also a significant increase in more appropriate responses from victims and bystanders. Thus, interventions like BP-PBS may be effective in alleviating the problem of bullying and victimization in schools. To really test this, such programs should be put into effect nationally. Effective counseling are also a necessary component of dealing with peer victimization in schools. The most important step to successful counseling is identifying the children who are being victimized. While physical victimization can be easily noticed, for example by the presence of bruises and scratches, relational victimization is harder to detect. It is difficult to realize what children are being ostracized or ridiculed, especially if the student doesn’t vocalize this treatment. Disciplining relational victimization is also a difficult task. Whereas physical victimization is usually punished with a school suspension, for example, it would seem ridiculous to respond to relational victimization with the same punishment. Because of such discrepancies, it is important to create and implement effective strategies for dealing with relational victimization.

==Trivia==
In a study evaluating the effectiveness of this program, Bauer, Lozano, &amp; Rivara (2007) found that the Olweus program had "mixed positive effects"; specifically, there was a 28% decrease in relational victimization and a 37% decrease in physical victimization.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L&amp;R&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bauer | first1 = Nerissa S. | last2 = Lozano | first2 = Paula | last3 = Rivara | first3 = Frederick P. | title = The effectiveness of the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program in public middle schools: a controlled trial | journal = [[Journal of Adolescent Health]] | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 266–274 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2006.10.005 | pmid = 17321428 | date = December 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36500">'''Psychological behaviorism''' is a form of [[behaviorism]] — a major theory within psychology which holds that generally human behaviors are learned — proposed by [[Arthur W. Staats]]. The theory is constructed to advance from basic animal learning principles to deal with all types of human behavior, including personality, culture, and human evolution. Behaviorism was first developed by [[John B. Watson]] (1912), who coined the term "behaviorism," and then [[B. F. Skinner]] who developed what is known as "radical behaviorism." Watson and Skinner rejected the idea that psychological data could be obtained through introspection or by an attempt to describe consciousness; all psychological data, in their view, was to be derived from the observation of outward behavior. The strategy of these behaviorists was that the animal learning principles should then be used to explain human behavior. Thus, their behaviorisms were based upon research with animals.

Staats' program takes the animal learning principles, in the form in which he presents them, to be basic. But, also on the basis of his study of human behaviors, adds human learning principles. These principles are unique, not evident in any other species.&lt;ref name="rfs"&gt;{{citation |author=Staats, Arthur W |year=1996 |title=Behavior and  personality: psychological behaviorism  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIyd4NBHGxAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=psychological+behaviorism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OFOhUdKCEuWXiQLqq4DAAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ |publisher= Springer |place=New York  |isbn= 0826193110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holth also critically reviews psychological behaviorism as a "path to the grand reunification of psychology and behavior analysis".&lt;ref name="holth"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holth | first1 = P | year = 2003 | title = Psychological Behaviorism: A Path to the Grand Reunification of Psychology and Behavior Analysis? | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_4/ai_n28173258/?tag=content;col1 | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 306–309 | doi=10.1037/h0100019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
The preceding behaviorisms of [[Ivan P. Pavlov]], [[Edward L. Thorndike]], [[John B. Watson]], [[B. F. Skinner]], and [[Clark L. Hull]] studied the basic principles of conditioning with animals. These behaviorists were animal researchers. Their basic approach was that those basic animal principles were to be applied to the explanation of human behavior. They did not have programs for the study of human behavior broadly, and deeply. 

Staats was the first to do his research with human subjects. His study ranged from research on basic principles to research and theory analysis of a wide variety of human behaviors, real life human behaviors. That is why [[Warren Tryon]] (2004) suggested that Staats change the name of his approach to psychological behaviorism, because Staats behaviorism is based upon human research and unifies aspects of traditional study with his behaviorism.
 
That includes his study of the basic principles. For example, the original behaviorists treated the two types of conditioning in different ways. The most generally used way by [[B. F. Skinner]] constructively considered [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]] to be separate and independent principles. In classical conditioning, if a piece of food is provided to a dog shortly after a buzzer is sounded, for a number of times, the buzzer will come to elicit salivation, part of an emotional response. In operant conditioning, if a piece of food is presented to a dog after the dog makes a particular motor response, the dog will come to make that motor response more frequently. 

For Staats, these two types of conditioning are not separate, they interact. A piece of food elicits an emotional response. A piece of food presented after the dog has made a motor response will have the effect of strengthening that motor response so that it occurs more frequently in the future.

Staats sees the piece of food to have two functions: one function is that of eliciting an emotional response, the other function is that of strengthening the motor behavior the precedes the presenting of food. So classical conditioning and operant conditioning are very much related.

Positive emotion stimuli will serve as positive reinforcers. Negative emotion stimuli will serve as punishers. As a consequence of humans’ inevitable learning positive emotion stimuli will serve as positive discriminative stimuli, incentives. Negative emotion stimuli will serve as negative discriminative stimuli, disincentives. So, emotion stimuli also have reinforcing value and discriminative stimulus value. Unlike Skinner’s basic principles, emotion and classical conditioning are central causes of behavior.

==Principles of human learning ==
Unlike the other behaviorisms, Staats’ considers human [[learning]] principles. He states that humans learn complex repertoires of behavior like language, values, and athletic skills –– that is cognitive, emotional, and sensory motor repertoires. When such a repertoire has been learned, they change the individual’s learning ability. A child who has learned language, a basic repertoire, can learn to read. A person who has learned a value system, such as a system of beliefs in human freedom, can learn to value different forms of government. An individual who has learned to be a track athlete, can learn to move more quickly as a football player. This introduces a basic principle of psychological behaviorism, that human behavior is learned cumulatively. Learning one repertoire enables the individual to learn other repertoires that enable the individual to learn additional repertoires, and on and on. Cumulative learning is a unique human characteristic. It has taken humans from chipping hand axes to flying to the moon, learned repertoires that enable the learning of new repertoires that enable the learning of new repertoires in an endless fashion of achievement.

That theory development enables psychological behaviorism to deal with types of human behavior. Out of the reach of radical behaviorism, for example, personality.

===Description&lt;!--'Behavioral repertoire' redirects here--&gt;===

Staats proposes that radical behaviorism is insufficient, because in his view psychology needs to unify traditional knowledge of human behavior with behaviorism. He has called that behaviorizing psychology in a way that enables psychological behaviorism to deal with topics not usually dealt with in behaviorism, such as personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/ |title=Behaviorism (Stanford Encyclopedia  of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, personality consists of three huge and complex '''behavioral repertoires'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;:&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;
* sensory-motor repertoire, including basic sensory-motor abilities, as well as attentional and social skills;
* language-cognitive repertoire, including receptive [[language]], expressive language, and receptive-expressive language;
* emotional-motivational repertoire, including positive and negative patterns of emotional reaction directing the whole behavior of the person.

The infant begins life without the basic behavioral repertoires. They are acquired through complex learning, and as this occurs, the child becomes able to respond appropriately to various situations.&lt;ref name="holth" /&gt;

Whereas at the beginning learning involves only basic conditioning, as repertories are acquired the child's learning improves, being aided by the repertoires that are already functional. The way a person experiences the world depends on his/her repertoires. The individual's environment to the present results in learning a basic behavioral repertoire (BBR). The individual's [[behavior]] is function of the life situation and the individual's BBR. The BBRs are both a dependent and an independent variable, as they result from learning and cause behavior,  constituting the individual's personality. According to this theory, biological conditions of  learning are essential. Biology provides the mechanisms for learning and performance of behavior.  For example, a severely brain-damaged child will not learn BBRs in a normal manner.

According to Staats, the biological organism is the mechanism by which the environment produces  learning that results in basic behavioral repertoires which constitute personality. In turn,  these repertoires, once acquired, are modifying the brain's biology, through the creation of new  neural connections. Organic conditions affect behavior through affecting learning, basic  repertoires, and sensory processes. The effect of environment on behavior can be proximal,  here-and-now, or distal, through memory and personality.&lt;ref name="holth"/&gt; Thus, biology  provides the mechanism, learning and environment provide the content of behavior and personality.  Creative behavior is explained by novel combinations of behaviors elicited by new, complex  environmental situations. The [[self (psychology)|self]] is the individual's perception of  his/her behavior, situation, and organism. Personality, situation, and the interaction between  them are the three main forces explaining behavior. The world acts upon the person, but the  person also acts both on the world, and on him/herself.

===Methods===
The methodology of psychological behavioral theory contains techniques of assessment and therapy  specially designed for the three behavioral repertoires:
* classical [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] techniques;
* [[language]]-[[cognitive]] techniques (verbal association, verbal imitation, and  verbal-writing);
* [[emotion]]al-[[motivational]] techniques (the [[Child time-out|time-out]] technique).&lt;ref  name="rfs"/&gt;

==The paradigm==

===Psychology and behaviorism===

Watson named the approach ''behaviorism'' as a form of revolution against the then prevalent use of introspection to study the mind. Introspection was subjective and variable, not a source of objective evidence, and the mind consisted of an inferred entity that could never be observed. He insisted psychology had to be based on objective observation of behavior and the objective observation of the environmental events that cause behavior. [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]]’s radical behaviorism also has not established a systematic relationship to traditional psychology knowledge.

Psychological behaviorism—while bolstering Watson’s rejection of inferring the existence of internal entities such as mind, personality, maturation stages, and free will—considers important knowledge produced by non-behavioral psychology that can be objectified by analysis in learning-behavioral terms. As one example, the concept of intelligence is inferred, not observed, and thus intelligence and intelligence tests are not considered systematically in behaviorism. However, PB considers IQ tests measure important behaviors that predict later school performance and intelligence is composed of learned repertoires of such behaviors. Joining the knowledge of behaviorism and intelligence testing yields concepts and research concerning what intelligence is behaviorally, what causes intelligence, as well as how intelligence can be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Staats | first1 = Arthur W. | last2 = Burns | first2 = G. Leonard | year = 1982 | title = Emotional personality repertoire as cause of behavior: Specification of personality and interaction principles | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 873–881 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.43.4.873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus a behaviorism that systematically incorporates and explains, behaviorally, empirical parts of psychology.

===Basic principles===

The different behaviourisms also differ with respect to basic principles. Skinner contributed greatly in separating Pavlov’s classical conditioning of emotion responses and operant conditioning of motor behaviors. Staats, however, notes that food was used by Pavlov to elicit a positive emotional response in his classical conditioning and Thorndike [[Edward Thorndike]] used food as the reward (reinforcer) that strengthened a motor response in what came to be called operant conditioning, thus emotion-eliciting stimuli are also reinforcing stimuli.&lt;ref name="SocialBehaviorism" /&gt; Watson, although the father of behaviorism, did not develop and research a basic theory of the principles of conditioning. The behaviorists whose work centered on that development treated differently the relationship of the two types of conditioning. Skinner’s basic theory was advanced in recognizing two different types of conditioning, but he didn’t recognize their interrelatedness, or the importance of classical conditioning, both very central for explaining human behavior and human nature.

Staats’ basic theory specifies the two types of conditioning and the principles of their relationship. Since Pavlov used a food stimulus to elicit an emotional response and Thorndike used food as a reward (reinforcer) to strengthen a particular motor response, whenever food is used both types of conditioning thus take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Arthur W.|title=Positive and Negative Reinforcer: How About the Second and Third Functions?|journal=Behavior Analyst|year=2006|volume=29|pages=271–272|pmc=2223154|pmid=22478469|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means that food both elicits a positive emotion and food will serve as a positive reinforcer (reward). It also means that any stimulus that is paired with food will come to have those two functions. Psychological behaviorism and Skinner’s behaviorism both consider operant conditioning a central explanation of human behavior, but PB additionally concerns emotion and classical conditioning.

===Language===

This difference between the two behaviorisms can be seen clearly in their theories of language. Staats, extending prior theory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mowrer|first=Orval|title=American Psychologist|quote=The Psychologist Looks at Language|year=1954|volume=9|pages=660–694|doi=10.1037/h0062737|journal=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osgood|first=Charles E.|title=Method and theory in experimental psychology|year=1953|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=0195010086}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that a large number of words elicit either a positive or negative emotional response because of prior classical conditioning. As such they should transfer their emotional response to anything with which they are paired. PB provides evidence this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Arthur|author2=Saats, Carolyn |title=Attitudes established by classical conditioning.|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |year=1959|volume=57 | issue = 1 |pages=37–40|doi=10.1037/h0042782}}&lt;/ref&gt; PB’s basic learning theory also states that emotional words have two additional functions. They will serve as rewards and punishments in learning other behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finley|first=Judson R.|author2=Staats, Arthur W. |title=Evaluative meaning words as reinforcing stimuli|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1967|volume=6|issue=2|pages=193–197|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(67)80094-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they also serve to elicit either approach or avoidance behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Arthur W.|author2=Warren, Don R. |title=Motivation and the three-function learning: Food deprivation and approach-avoidance to food words.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1974|volume=103|issue=6|pages=1191–1199|doi=10.1037/h0037417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, (1) hearing that people of an ethnic group are dishonest will condition a negative emotion to the name of that group as well as to members of that group, (2) complimenting (saying positive emotional words to) a person for a performance will increase the likelihood the person will perform that action later on, and (3) seeing the sign RESTAURANT will elicit a positive emotion in a hungry driver and thus instigate turning into the restaurant’s parking lot. Each case depends upon words eliciting an emotional response.

PB treats various aspects of language, from its original development in children to its role in intelligence and in abnormal behavior,&lt;ref name="Staats 1968a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 1968b"&gt;Staats, Arthur W.

(Eds.), Psychological foundations of attitudes. New York: Academic Press. {{ISBN|0805804072}}&lt;/ref&gt; and backs this up with basic and applied study. His theory paper in the journal Behavior Therapy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Staats | first1 = Arthur W | year = 1972 | title = Language behavior therapy: A derivative of social behaviorism | url = | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 165–192 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(72)80079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped introduce cognitive (language) behavior therapy to the behavioral field.

===Child development===

Much of the research on which PB is based has concerned children’s learning. For example, there is a series of studies of the first learning of reading with preschoolers &lt;ref&gt;Staats, Arthur W.; Brewer, Barbara A.; Gross, Michael C. (1970). "Learning and cognitive development: Representative samples, cumulative-hierarchical learning, and experimental-longitudinal learning.

Staats began studies to analyze cases of important human behaviors in basic and applied ways in 1954. In 1958 he analyzed dyslexia and introduced his token reinforcer system (later called the token economy) along with his teaching method and materials for treating the disorder. When his daughter Jenny was born in 1960 he began to study and to produce her language, emotional, and sensory-motor development. When she was a year and a half old he began teaching her number concepts, and then reading six months later, using his token reinforcer system, as he recorded on audiotape. Films were made in 1966 of Staats being interviewed about his conception of how variations in children’s home learning variously prepared them for school on the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVouEJ1B9io first of three Arthur Staats YouTube videos]. Following that the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YLOGiMe9U8 second Staats YouTube video] records him beginning teaching his three-year-old son with the reading learning (and counting) method he developed in 1962 with his daughter. This film also shows a graduate assistant working with a culturally deprived four-year-old learning reading and writing numbers and counting, participating voluntarily. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0gqlbwwtw Staats YouTube video number 3] has additional cases of these usually delayed children voluntarily learning much ahead of time these cognitive repertoires that prepare them for school. This group of 11 children gained an average of 11 points in IQ and advanced significantly on a child development measure as they also learned to like the learning situation. Staats published the first study in this series in 1962 and describes his later studies and his more general conception in his 1963 book. This research, that included work with his own children from birth on, was the basis for Staats’ books &lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 1971" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SocialBehaviorism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 2012" /&gt; specifying the importance of the parents' early training of the child in language and other cognitive repertoires. He shows they are the foundations for being intelligent and doing well on entering school. There are new studies showing that parents who talk to their children more have children with advanced language development, school success, and intelligence measures. These statistical studies should be joined with Staats’ work with individual children that shows the specifics of the learning involved and how to best produce it. The two together show powerfully the importance of early child learning.

Staats also applied his approach in fathering his own children and employed his findings in constructing conception of human behavior and human nature.&lt;ref name="Staats 1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 1968b"/&gt; He deals with many aspects of child development, from babbling to walking to discipline and time-out, and he considers parents one of his audiences.&lt;ref name="Staats 1971"/&gt; In the last of his books he summarizes his theory of child development. His position is that children are the young of the human species that has a body that can make an infinity of different behaviors. The human species also has a nervous system and brain of 100 billion neurons that can learn in marvelous complexity. The child’s development consists of the learning of repertoires, extraordinarily complex, like a language-cognitive repertoire, an emotional-motivational repertoire, and a sensory-motor repertoire, each including sub-repertoires of various kinds. The child’s behavior, in the various life situations encountered, depend upon the repertoires that have been learned. The child’s ability to learn in the variety of situations encountered also depends on the repertoires that have been learned. This conception makes parenting central in the child's development, supported by many studies in behavior analysis, and offers knowledge to parents in raising their children.

===Personality===

Staats &lt;ref name="Staats 2012"/&gt; describes humans great variability in behavior, across different people. Those individual differences are consistent in different life situations and typify people. Those differences also tend to run in families. Such phenomena have led to the concept of personality as some internal trait that is inherited that strongly determines individuals’ characteristic ways of behaving. Personality conceived in that way remains an inference, based on how people behave, but with no evidence of what personality is.

More successful has been the measurement of personality. There are tests of intelligence for example. No internal organ of intelligence has been found, and no genes either. But intelligence tests have been constructed that predict (helpfully but not perfectly) the performance of children in school. Children who have the behaviors measured on the tests display better learning behaviors in the classroom. Although such tests have been widely applied radical behaviorism has not invested in the study of personality or personality testing.

Psychological behaviorism (e.g.&lt;ref name="Staats 2012"/&gt;) however considers it important to study what personality is, how personality determines behavior, what causes personality, as well as what personality tests measure. Tests (including intelligence tests) are considered to measure different repertoires of behavior that individuals have learned. The individual in life situations also displays behaviors that have been learned. That is why personality tests can predict how people will behave. That means also that tests can be used to identify important human behaviors, and the learning that produces those behaviors can be studied. Gaining that knowledge will make it possible to develop environmental experiences that produce or prevent  types of personality from developing. A study has shown,&lt;ref name="IntelligenceIS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Arthur W.|author2=Burns, G. Leonard |title=Intelligence and child development: What intelligence is and how it is learned and functions|journal=Genetic Psychology Monographs|year=1981|volume=104|pages=237–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, that in learning to write letters of the alphabet children learn repertoires that make them more intelligent.

===Abnormal personality===

Psychological behaviorism’s theory of abnormal personality rejects the concept of mental illness. Rather behavior disorders are composed of learned repertoires of abnormal behavior. Behavior disorders also involve not having learned basic repertoires that are needed in adjusting to life's demands. Severe autism can involve not having learned a language repertoire as well as having learned tantrums and other abnormal repertoires.&lt;ref name="Staats 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur W. Staats|title=Behavior and Personality: Psychological Behaviorism|year=1996|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PB’s theories of various behavior disorders &lt;ref Name="Staats 2012"/&gt; employ the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=DSM-IV-TR : diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.|year=2000|publisher=AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PRESS INC (DC)|location=United States|isbn=0890420254|edition=4TH ED.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (DSM) descriptions of both abnormal repertoires and the absence of normal repertoires. Psychological behaviorism provides the framework for an approach to clinical treatment of behavior disorders, as shown in the field of behavior analysis.&lt;ref name="Staats 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IntelligenceIS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staats, Arthur W. (2003). "A psychological behaviorism theory of personality." In Millon, Theodore; Learner, Melvin J. (Eds.), Handbook of psychology [italics here]. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-38404-6}} pp 135-158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Staats | first1 = A. W. | year = 1957 | title = Learning theory and "opposite speech | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 268–269 | doi=10.1037/h0043902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 1975"&gt;Staats, (1975) ''Social Behaviorism''. Homewood, IL: Dorsey Press. {{ISBN|0256015376}}&lt;/ref&gt; PB theory also indicates how behavior disorders can be prevented by preventing the abnormal learning conditions that produce them.

===Education===

The PB theory is that child development, besides its physical growth, consists of the learning of repertoires some of which are basic in the sense they provide the behaviors for many life situations and also they determine what and how well the individual can learn. That theory states that humans are unique in having a building type of learning, [[cumulative learning]], in which basic repertoires enable the child to learn other repertoires that enable the learning of other repertoires. Learning language, for example, enables the child to learn various other repertoires, like reading, number concepts, and grammar. Those repertoires provide the bases for learning other repertoires. For example, reading ability, opens the possibilities for an individual to do things and learn things that a non-reader cannot.

With that theory, and with its empirical methodology, PB applies to education. For example, it has a theory of reading that explains children’s differences, from dyslexia to advanced reading ability.&lt;ref name="Staats 1975" /&gt; PB also suggests how to treat dyslexic children and those with other learning disabilities. Psychological behaviorism's approach has been supported and advanced in the field of behavior analysis.&lt;ref name="Staats 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staats, Arthur W. (1973). Behavior analysis and token reinforcement in educational behavior modification and curriculum research. Behavior modification in education: 72nd yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education.

New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston {{ISBN|0030716519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human evolution===

Human origin is generally explained by Darwin’s natural selection;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared (1992). The third chimpanzee. New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0060845503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehlich, Paul (2000). Human Natures. Washington, D.C.: Island Press/Shearwater Books {{ISBN|0142000531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen J. (1996) Dinosaur in a haystack. New York: Harmony Books. {{ISBN|978-0-517-88824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald &amp; Edgar, Blake (1996). From Lucy to language. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0684810239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tattersall, Ian, Schwartz, Jeffrey H. (2000). Extinct humans. New York: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Darwin gathered imposing evidence showing the evolution of physical characteristics of species his view that behavioral characteristics (such as human intelligence) also evolved was pure assumption with no evidentiary support PB presents a different theory, that the cumulative learning of pre-human hominins drove human evolution. That explains the consistent increase in brain size over the course of human evolution. That occurred because the members of the evolving hominin species were continually learning new language, emotion-motivation, and sensory-motor repertoires. That meant the new generations had to learn those ever more complex repertoires. It was cumulative learning that consistently created the selection device for the members of those generations that had the larger brains and were the better learners.

That theory makes learning ability central in human origin, selecting who would survive and reproduce, until the advent of Homo sapiens where all individuals (except if damaged) have full brains and full learning ability.&lt;ref Name="Staats 2012"/&gt;

===Theory levels===

Psychological behaviorism is set forth as an overarching theory, constructed of multiple theories in various areas. Staats considers it a unified theory. The areas are related, their principles consistent, and they are advanced consistently, composing levels from basic to increasingly advanced. Its most basic level calls for a systematic study of the biology of the learning “organs” and their evolutionary development, from species like amoeba that have no learning ability to humans that have the most. The basic learning principles constitute another level of theory, as do the human learning principles that specify cumulative learning. How the principles work—in areas like child development, personality, abnormal personality, clinical treatment, education, and human evolution—compose additional levels of study.&lt;ref Name="Staats 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 1975" /&gt; Staats sees the overarching theory of PB as basic for additional levels that compose the social sciences of sociology, linguistics, political science, anthrology, and paleoanthropology. He criticizes the disunification of the sciences that study human behavior and human nature. Because they are disconnected, they do not build a related, simpler and more understandable conception and scientific endeavor as, for example, the biological sciences do.&lt;ref name="Disunity" /&gt; This philosophy of science of unification is at one with Staats’ attempt to construct his unified psychological behaviorism.

===Projections===

Psychological behaviorism’s works project new basic and applied science at its various theory levels. The basic principles level, as one example, needs to study systematically the relationship of the classical conditioning of emotional responses and the operant conditioning of motor responses. As another projection, the field of child development should focus on the study of the learning of the basic repertoires. One essential is the systematic detailed study of the learning experiences of children in the home from birth on. He says such research could be accomplished by installing cameras in the homes of volunteering, remunerated families. This research should also be done to discover how such learning produces both normal and abnormal personality development. As another example, PB also calls for educational research into how school learning could be advanced using its methods and theories. Also, Staats' theory of human evolution is seen to call for research and theory developments.&lt;ref Name="Staats 2012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10352">'''Psychological mindedness''' refers to a person's capacity for self-examination, self-reflection, [[introspection]] and personal [[insight]]. It includes an ability to recognize meanings that underlie overt words and actions, to appreciate emotional nuance and complexity, to recognize the links between past and present, and insight into one's own and others' motives and  intentions.  Psychologically minded people have above average insight into mental life.

Conceptual definitions of psychological mindedness have included variant, but related descriptions. Some definitions relate solely to the self, "a person's ability to see relationships among [[thought]]s, [[emotion|feeling]]s, and actions with the goal of learning the meanings and causes of his [[experience]]s and [[behavior]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Appelbaum SA |title=Psychological-mindedness: word, concept and essence |journal=The International journal of psycho-analysis |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=35–46 |year=1973 |pmid=4724251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conte (1996) extended the concept beyond self-focus, as involving "... both self-understanding and an interest in the motivation and behavior of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conte HR, Ratto R, Karusa T | year = 1996 | title = The Psychological Mindedness Scale: Factor structure and relationship to outcome of psychotherapy |url=http://jppr.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/5/3/250 | journal = Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 250–259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall's (1992) definition introduces the multidimensional nature of PM.

The ''[[Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual]]'' (PDM) describes psychological mindedness as an individual's ability to observe and reflect on his or her own internal life. The PDM details a four-point scale from high to low psychological mindedness, or 'healthy-to-impaired functioning'.

# Can reflect on (i.e. observe and experience at the same time) a full range of own and others' feelings or experiences (including subtle variations in feelings). Can reflect both in the present and with reference to a longer-term view of self, values, and goals. Can reflect on multiple relationships between feelings and experiences, across the full range of age-expected experiences in the context of new challenges.
# Can reflect on feelings or experiences of self and others both in the present and with reference to a longer-term view of a sense of self, values, and goals for ''some'' age-expected experiences, but not others. Cannot be reflective in this way when feelings are strong.
# Can reflect on moment-to-moment experiences, but not with reference to a longer-term sense of self and experiences, values, and goals.
# Unable to reflect genuinely on feelings or experiences, even in the present. Self-awareness consists often of polarized feeling states or simple basic feelings without an appreciation of subtle variations in feelings. Self-awareness is lacking, and there may be a tendency toward fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;PDM Task Force. (2006). Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual. Silver Spring, MD: Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations. p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality correlates ==
Psychological mindedness (PM) is expected to be related to psychological strength and negatively related to weakness.  One study found a [[correlation]] between PM and two of the [[Big Five personality traits]] ([[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]] and [[openness to experience]]) and a negative correlation with [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name = Beitel2003&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beitel | first = M |author2=Cecero JJ  | year = 2003 | title = Predicting psychological mindedness from personality style and attachment security | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | doi = 10.1002/jclp.10125 | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–72 | pmid = 12508339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other studies have linked it to the tolerance of ambiguity,&lt;ref name = Beitel2004&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beitel | first = M |author2=Cecero JJ |author3=Ferrer E  | year = 2004 | title = Psychological mindedness and cognitive style | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | doi = 10.1002/jclp.10258 | volume = 60 | issue = 6 | pages = 567–82 | pmid = 15141393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]], [[empathy]]&lt;ref name = Beitel2005&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beitel | first = M |author2=Cecero JJ |author3=Ferrer E  | year = 2005 | title = Psychological mindedness and awareness of self and others | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20095 | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 739–50 | pmid = 15546143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and positive adjustment to college.&lt;ref name = Beitel2008&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beitel | first = M |author2=Cecero JJ |author3=Prout T | year = 2008 | title = Exploring the relationships among early maladaptive schemas, psychological mindedness and self-reported college adjustment | journal = Psychology and psychotherapy | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 105–18 |url=http://www.biomedexperts.com/Abstract.bme/17588307/Exploring_the_relationships_among_early_maladaptive_schemas_psychological_mindedness_and_self-reported_college_adjustme | doi = 10.1348/147608307X216177 | pmid = 17588307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  PM has also been associated negatively with problem-oriented psychological constructs such as the personality factor of [[neuroticism]],&lt;ref name = Beitel2003/&gt; the cognitive constructs of [[magical thinking]] and [[external locus of control]],&lt;ref name = Beitel2004/&gt; and early maladaptive [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]].&lt;ref name = Beitel2008/&gt;  Low PM has also been linked to [[alexithymia]], suggesting that certain [[clinical psychology|clinical]] patients do not respond to counseling due to a lack of PM.&lt;ref name=Taylor1997&gt;{{cite book |author1=Piper, WB |author2=McCallum, M |title=Psychological mindedness: a contemporary understanding |publisher=[[Taylor and Francis|Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1997 |pages=77–104 |isbn=0-8058-1722-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In groups, environments and society ==
In the UK a lot of work has been done to extend the concept of psychological mindedness beyond the individual. This work recognises that the health and success of families, schools, hospitals, businesses, communities and indeed society as a whole depends in a large part on the psychological mindedness of the system or environment created by that institution. This is more than the sum of the individual parts. For example, an individual nurse on a psychiatric ward may be psychologically minded and motivated to connect with a service user who may also have some psychological mindedness. However, the chances of two such individuals having a psychologically minded encounter can easily be sabotaged by a "psychologically blind" or "alexithymic" care system that allows the nurse no time, no headspace, no structure and no back up to function in this way. It is well known that nurses on chaotic psychiatric wards have to shut off emotionally just to survive personally in the face of the overwhelming demands placed upon them. Once this happens the experience for the service user will obviously become one of "not being listened to". This real emotional neglect coupled with transference factors is what leads to so many incidents on our psychiatric wards. Service users who feel rejected are bound to escalate their behaviour in order to be heard and in order to "hit back" at those who are in effect just repeating the failures of past caregivers.

Martin Seager&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seager | first1= M. |title=The Concept of "Psychologcal Safety" - A psychoanalytically informed contribution towards "safe, sound and supportive" mental health services|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy|volume =20|issue=4|date=December 2006|pages= 266–280 | doi=10.1080/02668730601020291  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2006) developed the concept of "psychological safety" to explain and address these kinds of problems in health care systems. Out of this work, Martin was invited by the then secretary of state for health, [[Patricia Hewitt]], to form in 2007 a "national advisory group" on the universal psychological principles and standards underpinning good mental health care. Martin was able to convene a group of distinguished thinkers from the full range of psychological approaches to produce a guiding document. Group members included [[Susie Orbach]], [[Andrew Samuels]], Lucy Johnstone and [[Valerie Sinason]]. The core recommendations of this group took account of all psychological theory and spiritual factors in the human condition. "Psychological mindedness" was the concept and the phrase that seemed to bind everything together. This work has led to the formation of a further national working group (2008) on the back of the [[Improving Access to Psychological Therapies]] (IAPT) initiative in the UK. This new working group is looking at "10 high impact changes" for mental health policy in the UK that will increase psychological mindedness. The group aims to stimulate a proactive public health psychological policy that will address the relational and environmental causes of mental health problems and shift the emphasis away from an exclusive focus on reactive psychological treatments. It was found that females tend to be more psychologically minded than males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shill|title=The Psychological Mindedness Scale: factor structure, convergent validity and gender in a non-psychiatric sample.| pmid=12396760 | doi=10.1348/147608302169607|volume=75|issue=Pt 2|date=June 2002|journal=Psychol Psychother|pages=131–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Electoral systems}}
The '''random ballot''', '''single stochastic vote''', or '''lottery voting''' is an [[electoral system]] in which an election is decided on the basis of a single randomly selected ballot. Whilst appearing superficially chaotic, the system has the potential to retain the most attractive characteristics of both [[first past the post]] and [[proportional representation]] systems in elections to multi-constituency bodies. It was first described in 1984 by [[Akhil Reed Amar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Akhil Reed Amar]] |date=June 1984 |title=Choosing representatives by lottery voting |volume=93 |issue=7 |journal=[[Yale Law Journal]] |pages=1283–1308 |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/1984Choosing.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |jstor=796258 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831192620/http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/1984Choosing.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method and properties==
In an [[election]] or [[referendum]], the ballot of a single voter is selected at random, and that ballot decides the result of the election.  In this way, each candidate or option wins with a probability exactly equal to the fraction of the electorate favouring that candidate or option.

The random ballot method is decisive, in that there is no possibility of a tied vote, assuming that the selected voter has expressed a preference (if not then another ballot can be selected at random). It is unbiased, in that the [[probability]] of a particular result is equal to the proportion of total support that that result has in all the votes.  When used in a single-winner contest, it is also strategy-free, in that there is no advantage in [[tactical voting]].  But it is not deterministic, in that a different random selection could have produced a different result, and it does not conform to [[majority]] rule since there is a possibility that the selected voter may be in the [[minority group|minority]].

===Emergent properties===
{{see also|emergent property}}
If the random ballot is used to select the members of a multi-constituency body, it can serve to retain the attractive features of both [[first past the post]] and [[proportional representation]].

As the winner of each ballot is chosen randomly, the party with the largest vote share is most likely to get the greatest number of candidates. In fact, as the number of ballots grows, the percentage representation of each party in the elected body will get closer and closer to their actual proportion of the vote across the entire electorate. At the same time, the chance of a randomly selected highly unrepresentative body diminishes.

For example, a minority party with 1% of the vote might have a 1/100 chance of getting a seat in each ballot. In a 50-person assembly, the probability of a majority for this party being chosen by random ballot is approximately (using the [[binomial distribution]] CDF)

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{24} {50 \choose k} \left(\frac{99}{100}\right)^k\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^{50-k} = I_{1/100}(26, 25) \approx 10^{-38}, &lt;/math&gt;

or one in hundred [[undecillion]]. This is a vanishingly small chance, which negates the possibility of small parties winning majorities due to random chance.

At same time, the random ballot preserves a local representative for each constituency, although this individual may not have received a majority of votes of his or her constituents.

==Prevalence==
There are no examples of the random ballot in use in practice, but as a [[thought experiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Akhil Reed Amar]]|title="Lottery Voting: A Thought Experiment"|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1963&amp;context=fss_papers|date=1 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been used to explain some of the properties of other electoral systems, and it is occasionally used in real life as a tiebreaker for other methods.

==In fiction==
{{Relevance}}
A related system was hypothesized by [[Isaac Asimov]] in his short story "[[Franchise (Asimov)|Franchise]]" (1955: reprinted in ''[[Earth Is Room Enough]]'', Doubleday, 1957), where a single voter is chosen to decide each election. However, in Asimov's thought-experiment, the "elector" is not randomly selected, but chosen by computer to be as representative as possible of the populace at large. Asimov intended this story as a parody of [[opinion poll]]ing.

==Randomness in other electoral systems==
There is an element of randomness (other than tie-breaking) in some existing electoral systems, in two ways:

#It is often observed that candidates who are placed in a high position on the ballot-paper will receive extra votes as a result, from voters who are apathetic (especially in elections with [[compulsory voting]]) or who have a strong preference for a party but are indifferent among individual candidates representing that party (when there are two or more). For this reason, many societies have abandoned traditional alphabetical listing of candidates on the ballot in favour of either ranking by the parties (e.g., the [[Australian Senate]]), placement by lot, or rotation (e.g., [[Hare-Clark]] STV-PR system used in [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]). When candidates are ordered by lot on the ballot, the advantage of [[donkey voting]] can be decisive in a close race.
#In some [[single transferable vote]]  (STV) systems of [[proportional representation]], an elected candidate's surplus of votes over and above the [[Droop quota|quota]] is transferred by selecting the required number of ballot papers at random. Thus, if the quota is 1,000 votes, a candidate who polls 1,200 [[first preference]] votes has a surplus of 200 votes that s/he does not need. In some STV systems ([[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] since 1922, and [[Australia]] from 1918 to 1984), electoral officials select 200 ballot-papers randomly from the 1,200. However, this has been criticised since it is not replicable if a recount is required. As a result, Australia has adopted a variant of [[fractional transfer]], a.k.a. the "[[Gregory method]]", by which all 1,200 ballot-papers are transferred but are marked down in value to 0.1666 (one-sixth) of a vote each. This means that 1,000 votes "stay with" the elected candidate, while the value of the 1,200 ballot-papers transferred equals only 200 votes.

==Similarities to other electoral systems==
A random ballot elects a representative by choosing a ballot at random; [[sortition]] is similar but elects individuals directly by lot, as if each ballot involved individuals voting for themselves.

The '''Saṃbhogakāya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: "body of enjoyment"{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=126}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sambhogakaya has also been translated as the "deity dimension", "body of bliss" or "astral body"}}, [[Standard Tibetan|Tib:]] ''longs spyod rdzog pa'i sku'') is the second mode or aspect of the [[Trikaya]].

==Definition==

===Celestial manifestations===
The Sambhogakaya is a "subtle body of limitless form".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=126}} Both "celestial" Buddhas such as [[Bhaisajyaguru]] and [[Amitābha]], as well as advanced bodhisattvas such as [[Avalokiteśvara]] and [[Manjusri]] can appear in an "enjoyment-body."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} A Buddha can appear in an "enjoyment-body" to teach bodhisattvas through visionary experiences.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=126}}

Those [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s manifest themselves in their specific [[pure land]]s. These worlds are created for the benefits of others. In those lands it is easy to hear and practice the [[Dharma]]. A person can be reborn in such a pure land by "the transfer of some of the huge stock of 'merit' of a Land's presiding Buddha, stimulated by devout prayer.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=126}}

One of the places where the Sambhogakāya body appears is the extra-cosmic realm or pure land called Akaniṣṭha. This is one of the highest realms of the [[Buddhist cosmology#Pure Abodes|Śuddhāvāsa]] [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]].

Absolutely seen, only the [[Dharmakāya]] is real; the Sambhogakāya and [[Trikaya|Nirmanakaya]] are "provisional ways of talking about and apprehending it".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=128}}

===Access by advanced practitioners===
Sambhogakaya also refers to the luminous form of clear light the Buddhist practitioner attains upon the reaching the highest dimensions of practice.

According to tradition, those skilled in meditation, such as advanced Tibetan lamas and yogis, as well as other highly realized Buddhists, may gain access to the Sambhogakaya and receive direct transmission of doctrine.

==Understanding in Buddhist tradition==

===Tibetan Buddhism===
There are numerous Sambhogakāya realms almost as numerous as deities in Tibetan Buddhism. These Sambhogakaya-realms are known as Buddha-fields or [[Pure land|Pure Lands]].

One manifestation of the Sambhogakaya in Tibetan Buddhism is the [[rainbow body]]. This is where an advanced practitioner is walled up in a cave or sewn inside a small yurt-like tent shortly before death. For a period of a week or so after death, the practitioners' body transforms into a Sambhogakaya light body, leaving behind only hair and nails.

[[Lopön Tenzin Namdak]] as rendered by John Myrdhin Reynolds conveyed the relationship of the [[mindstream]] (Sanskrit: ''citta santana'') of Sambhogakaya that links the Dharmakaya with the Nirmanakaya.{{sfn|Namdak|1991}}

===Chán Buddhism===
In the [[Chán]] (禪) (Jp. [[Zen]]) tradition, the Sambhogakāya (Chin. 報身↔''baoshen'', lit. "retribution body"), along with the [[Dharmakaya]] and the [[Nirmanakaya]], are given metaphorical interpretations.

In the ''[[Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch]]'', Chan Master [[Huineng]] describes the Samboghakaya as a state in which the practitioner continually and naturally produces good thoughts:
{{quote|Think not of the past but of the future. Constantly maintain the future thoughts to be good. This is what we call the Sambhogakāya.&lt;br&gt;
Just one single evil thought could destroy the good karma that has continued for one thousand years; and just one single good thought in turn could destroy the evil karma that has lived for one thousand years.&lt;br&gt;
If the future thoughts are always good, you may call this the Sambhogakāya. The discriminative thinking arising from the Dharmakāya (法身↔''fashen'' "Truth body") is called the Nirmanakāya (化身↔''huashen'' "transformation body"). The successive thoughts that forever involve good are thus the Sambhogakāya.{{sfn|Yampolski|1967}}}}

A '''sensorium''' (/sɛnˈsɔːrɪəm/)&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionaries"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of sensorium|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sensorium|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (plural: '''sensoria''') is the sum of an organism's [[perception]], the "seat of [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]]" where it experiences and interprets the environments within which it lives. The term originally entered English from the Late Latin in the mid-17th century, from the stem ''sens-'' ("[[sense]]"). In earlier use it referred, in a broader sense, to the brain as the mind's organ (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' 1989). In medical, psychological, and physiological discourse it has come to refer to the total character of the unique and changing sensory environments perceived by individuals. These include the sensation, perception, and interpretation of information about the world around us by using faculties of the [[mind]] such as senses, phenomenal and psychological perception, [[cognition]], and [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name="MedicineNet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Definition of Sensorium|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15732|website=MedicineNet|accessdate=July 21, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ratios of sensation ==
In the 20th century the sensorium became a key part of the theories of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]] and [[Walter J. Ong]] (Carpenter and McLuhan 1960; Ong 1991).

McLuhan, like his mentor [[Harold Innis]], believed that media were biased according to [[Harold Innis's communications theories|time and space]]. He paid particular attention to what he called the sensorium, or the ''effects'' of media on our senses, positing that media affect us by manipulating the ratio of our senses. For example, the [[alphabet]] stresses the sense of sight, which in turn causes us to think in linear, objective terms. The medium of the alphabet thus has the effect of reshaping the way in which we, collectively and individually, perceive and understand our environment in what has been termed the [[Alphabet Effect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/002033-2010-e.html Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001082647/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/002033-2010-e.html |date=2007-10-01 }}, a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on variations in the sensorium across social contexts, these theorists collectively suggest that the world is explained and experienced differently depending on the specific "ratios of sense" that members of a [[culture]] share in the sensoria they learn to inhabit (Howes 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;8). More recent work has demonstrated that individuals may include in their unique sensoria perceptual proclivities that exceed their cultural norms; even when, as in the history of smell in the West, the sense in question is suppressed or mostly ignored (Classen, Howes and Synnott 1994).

This interplay of various ways of conceiving the world could be compared to the experience of [[synesthesia]], where stimulus of one sense causes a perception by another, seemingly unrelated sense, as in musicians who can taste the intervals between notes they hear (Beeli ''et al''., 2005), or artists who can smell colors. Many individuals who have one or more senses restricted or lost develop a sensorium with a ratio of sense which favors those they possess more fully. Frequently the blind or deaf speak of a compensating effect, whereby their sense of touch or smell becomes more acute, changing the way they perceive and reason about the world; especially telling examples are found in the cases of "wild children", whose early childhoods were spent in abusive, neglected, or non-human environments, both intensifying and minimizing perceptual abilities (Classen 1991).

== Development of unique sensoria in cultures and individuals ==
Although some {{who|date=April 2015}} consider these modalities abnormal, it is more likely that these examples demonstrate the contextual and socially learned nature of sensation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} A 'normal' sensorium and a 'synesthetic' one differ based on the division, connection, and interplay of the body's manifold sensory apparatus. A synesthete has simply developed a different set of relationships, including cognitive or interpretive skills which deliver unique abilities and understanding of the world (Beeli et al., 2005). The sensorium is a creation of the physical, biological, [[social environment|social]] and cultural [[natural environment|environments]] of the individual organism and its relationships while being in the world.

What is considered a strange blurring of sensation from one perspective, is a normal and [[nature#The natural and the artificial|'natural']] way of perception of the world in another, and indeed many individuals and their cultures develop sensoria fundamentally different from the vision-centric modality of most Western science and culture. One revealing contrast is the thought of a former Russian on the matter:
:The dictionary of the Russian language...defines the sense of touch as follows: "In reality all five senses can be reduced to one---the sense of touch. The tongue and palate sense the food; the ear, sound waves; the nose, emanations; the eyes, rays of light." That is why in all textbooks the sense of touch is always mentioned first. It means to ascertain, to perceive, by body, hand or fingers (Anonymous 1953).

As David Howes explains:
:The reference to Russian textbooks treating touch first, in contrast to American psychology textbooks which always begin with sight, is confirmed by other observers (Simon 1957) and serves to highlight how the hierarchization of the senses can vary significantly even between cultures belonging to the same general tradition (here, that of "the West") (2003, pp. 12-13).

== Sensory ecology and anthropology ==
These sorts of insights were the impetus for the development of the burgeoning field of [[sensory anthropology]], which seeks to understand other cultures from within their own unique sensoria. Anthropologists such as Paul Stoller (1989) and [[Michael Jackson (anthropologist)|Michael Jackson]] (1983, 1989) have focused on a critique of the [[hegemony]] of vision and textuality in the social sciences. They argue for an understanding and analysis that is embodied, one sensitive to the unique context of sensation of those one wishes to understand. They believe that a thorough awareness and adoption of other sensoria is a key requirement if ethnography is to approach true understanding.

A related area of study is [[sensory ecology|sensory (or perceptual) ecology]]. This field aims at understanding the unique sensory and interpretive systems all organisms develop, based on the specific ecological environments they live in, experience and adapt to. A key researcher in this field has been psychologist [[J. J. Gibson|James J. Gibson]], who has written numerous seminal volumes considering the senses in terms of holistic, self-contained perceptual systems. These exhibit their own mindful, interpretive behaviour, rather than acting simply as conduits delivering information for [[cognitive]] processing, as in more representational [[philosophy of perception|philosophies of perception]] or theories of [[psychology]] (1966, 1979). Perceptual systems detect [[affordance]]s in objects in the world, directing attention towards information about an object in terms of the possible uses it affords an organism.

The individual sensory systems of the body are only parts of these broader perceptual [[ecology|ecologies]], which include the physical apparatus of sensation, the [[natural environment|environment]] being sensed, as well as both learned and innate systems for directing attention and interpreting the results. These systems represent and enact the [[information]] ([[information#As an influence which leads to a transformation|as an influence which leads to a transformation]]) required to perceive, identify or reason about the world, and are distributed across the very design and structures of the body, in relation to the physical environment, as well as in the concepts and interpretations of the mind. This information varies according to species, physical environment, and the context of information in the social and cultural systems of perception, which also change over time and space, and as an individual learns through living. Any single perceptual modality may include or overlap multiple sensory structures, as well as other modes of perception, and the sum of their relations and the ratio of mixture and importance comprise a sensorium. The perception, understanding, and reasoning of an organism is dependent on the particular experience of the world delivered by changing ratios of sense.

== Clouded sensorium ==
A '''clouded sensorium''', also known as an '''altered sensorium''', is a medical condition characterized by the inability to think clearly or concentrate. It is usually [[synonym]]ous with, or substantially overlapping with, [[altered level of consciousness]]. It is associated with a huge variety of underlying causes from drug induced states to pathogenic states induced by disease or mineral deficiency.

Note that the initiation codon is not drawn to scale, otherwise the letters AUG would each have a height of 2 bits.]]

In [[bioinformatics]], a '''sequence logo''' is a graphical representation of the [[sequence conservation]] of [[nucleotide]]s (in a strand of [[DNA]]/[[RNA]]) or [[amino acid]]s (in [[protein sequence]]s).&lt;ref name="Schneider1990"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schneider TD |author2=Stephens RM |title=Sequence Logos: A New Way to Display Consensus Sequences |url=http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/papers/logopaper |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=18 |issue=20 |pages=6097–6100 |year=1990 |pmid=2172928 |doi=10.1093/nar/18.20.6097 |pmc=332411}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A sequence logo is created from a collection of aligned sequences and depicts the consensus sequence and diversity of the sequences.
Sequence logos are frequently used to depict sequence characteristics such as protein-binding sites in DNA or functional units in proteins.

==Overview==
A sequence logo consists of a stack of letters at each position.  
The relative sizes of the letters indicate their frequency in the sequences.  
The total height of the letters depicts the information content of the position, in bits.

==Logo creation==
To create sequence logos, related DNA, RNA or protein sequences, or DNA sequences that have common conserved binding sites, are aligned so that the most conserved parts create good alignments. A sequence logo can then be created from the conserved [[multiple sequence alignment]]. The sequence logo will show how well residues are conserved at each position: the higher the number of residues, the higher the letters will be, because the better the conservation is at that position. Different residues at the same position are scaled according to their frequency. The height of the entire stack of residues is the [[information]] measured in [[bit]]s. Sequence logos can be used to represent conserved [[DNA binding site]]s, where [[transcription factor]]s bind.

The information content (y-axis) of position &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is given by:&lt;ref name="Schneider1986"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schneider TD |author2=Stormo GD |title=Information content of binding sites on nucleotide sequences |url=http://cs.utsa.edu/~jruan/teaching/cs5263_fall_2007/papers/information_content_stormo.pdf |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=188 |issue=3 |pages=415–431 |year=1986 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(86)90165-8 |pmid=3525846}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:for amino acids, &lt;math&gt;R_i = \log_2(20) - (H_i + e_n)&lt;/math&gt;
:for nucleic acids, &lt;math&gt;R_i = \log_2(4) - (H_i + e_n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H_i&lt;/math&gt; is the uncertainty
(sometimes called the Shannon [[Entropy (Information theory)|entropy]]) of position &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_i = - \sum_{b=a}^{t} f_{b,i} \times \log_2 f_{b,i} &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;f_{b,i}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Frequency (statistics)|relative frequency]] of base or amino acid &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; at position &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt; is the small-sample correction for an alignment of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; letters. The height of letter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in column &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\text{height} = f_{b,i} \times R_i&lt;/math&gt;

The approximation for the small-sample correction, &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;e_n = \frac{1}{\ln{2}}\times\frac{s-1}{2n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is 4 for nucleotides, 20 for amino acids, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of sequences in the alignment.

==Consensus logo==

A '''consensus logo''' is a simplified variation of a sequence logo that can be embedded in text format.
Like a sequence logo, a consensus logo is created from a collection of aligned protein or DNA/RNA sequences and conveys information about the conservation of each position of a [[sequence motif]] or [[sequence alignment]]&lt;ref name="Schneider1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anzaldi2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anzaldi LJ |author2=Muñoz-Fernández D |author3=Erill I. |title=BioWord: a sequence manipulation suite for Microsoft Word |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2105-13-124.pdf |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=13 |issue=124 |year=2012 |pmid=22676326 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-13-124 |pmc=3546851 |pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. However, a consensus logo displays only conservation information, and not explicitly the frequency information of each [[nucleotide]] or [[amino acid]] at each position. Instead of a stack made of several characters, denoting the relative frequency of each character, the consensus logo depicts the degree of conservation of each position using the height of the consensus character at that position.

[[Image:LexA gram positive bacteria consensus logo.png|500px|none|thumb|right|A consensus logo for the LexA-binding motif of several Gram-positive species.]]

===Advantages and drawbacks===
The main, and obvious, advantage of consensus logos over sequence logos is their ability to be embedded as text in any [[Rich Text Format]] supporting editor/viewer and, therefore, in scientific manuscripts. As described above, the consensus logo is a cross between sequence logos and [[consensus sequence]]s. As a result, compared to a sequence logo, the consensus logo omits information (the relative contribution of each character to the conservation of that position in the motif/alignment). Hence, a sequence logo should be used preferentially whenever possible. That being said, the need to include graphic figures in order to display sequence logos has perpetuated the use of consensus sequences in scientific manuscripts, even though they fail to convey information on both conservation and frequency.&lt;ref name="Schneider2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schneider TD |title=Consensus Sequence Zen|journal=Appl Bioinform |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=111–119 |year=2002 |pmid=15130839 |doi=|pmc=1852464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consensus logos represent therefore an improvement over consensus sequences whenever motif/alignment information has to be constrained to text.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1117">The '''state of affairs''' is the combination of circumstances applying within a society or group at a particular time. The current state of affairs may be considered acceptable by many observers, but not necessarily by all. The state of affairs may present a challenge, or be complicated, or contain a [[conflict of interest]]. The [[status quo]] represents the existing state of affairs. Unresolved difficulties or disagreements concerning the state of affairs can provoke a [[crisis]]. [[Dispute resolution]] is naturally desired, and naturally provided, by forms of inclusive social interaction, such as [[consensus decision-making]], which adapt, but not conveniently,  from a family or tribal model to encompass a global scope.
Current knowledge and discussion about the state of affairs is communicated through the media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25380">'''Status quo bias''' is an [[emotional bias]]; a preference for the current state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss.
Status quo bias should be distinguished from a rational preference for the [[status quo]] ante, as when the current state of affairs is objectively superior to the available alternatives, or when imperfect information is a significant problem. A large body of evidence, however, shows that status quo bias frequently affects human decision-making.

Status quo bias interacts with other non-rational cognitive processes such as [[loss aversion]], existence bias, [[endowment effect]], longevity, mere exposure, and regret avoidance.  Experimental evidence for the detection of status quo bias is seen through the use of the [[reversal test]]. A vast amount of experimental and field examples exist. Behaviour in regard to retirement plans, health, and ethical choices show evidence of the status quo bias.

==Examples==
[[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]], [[Richard Thaler|Thaler]], and [[Jack Knetsch|Knetsch]] created experiments that could produce this effect reliably.&lt;ref name=Knetsch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahneman | first1 = D. | last2 = Knetsch | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Thaler | first3 = R. H. | year = 1991 | title = Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 193–206 | doi=10.1257/jep.5.1.193}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuelson]] and [[Zeckhauser]] (1988) demonstrated status quo bias using a questionnaire in which subjects faced a series of decision problems, which were alternately framed to be with and without a pre-existing status quo position. Subjects tended to remain with the status quo when such a position was offered to them.&lt;ref name=Samuelson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samuelson | first1 = W. | last2 = Zeckhauser | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Status quo bias in decision making | url = | journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 7–59 | doi=10.1007/bf00055564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypothetical Choice Tasks:'''
Subjects were given a hypothetical
choice task in the following "neutral" version, in which no status
quo was defined: "You are a serious reader of the financial pages
but until recently you have had few funds to invest. That is when
you inherited a large sum of money from your great-uncle. You are
considering different portfolios. Your choices are to invest in: a
moderate-risk company, a high-risk company, treasury bills, municipal
bonds." Other subjects were presented with the same problem
but with one of the options designated as the status quo. In this
case, the opening passage continued: "A significant portion of this
portfolio is invested in a moderate risk company . . . (The tax and broker commission consequences of any changes are insignificant.)"
The result was that an alternative became much more popular
when it was designated as the status quo.&lt;ref name=Samuelson /&gt;

'''Electric Power Consumers:'''
California electric power consumers were
asked about their preferences regarding trade-offs between service
reliability and rates. The respondents fell into two groups, one with
much more reliable service than the other. Each group was asked
to state a preference among six combinations of reliability and rates,
with one of the combinations designated as the status quo. A strong
bias to the status quo was observed. Of those in the high-reliability
group, 60.2 percent chose the status quo, whereas a mere 5.7 percent
chose the low-reliability option that the other group had been
experiencing, despite its lower rates. Similarly, of those in the low reliability
group, 58.3 chose their low-reliability status quo, and only
5.8 chose the high-reliability option.&lt;ref name=Consumer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartman|first=Raymond S.|author2=Chi-Keung Woo |title=Consumer Rationality and the Status Quo|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|year=1991|volume=106|pages=141–162|doi=10.2307/2937910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automotive Insurance Consumers and Other Examples:'''
The US states of [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] inadvertently ran a real-life experiment providing evidence of status quo bias in the early 1990s. As part of [[tort law]] reform programs, citizens were offered two options for their automotive insurance: an expensive option giving them full right to [[lawsuit|sue]] and a less expensive option with restricted rights to sue. In New Jersey the cheaper option was the default and most citizens selected it. Only a minority chose the cheaper option in Pennsylvania, where the more expensive option was the default.  Similar effects have been shown for contributions to retirement plans, choice of [[internet privacy]] policies and the decision to become an organ donor.

==Explanations==
Status quo bias has been attributed to a combination of [[loss aversion]] and the [[endowment effect]], two ideas relevant to [[prospect theory]]. An individual weighs the potential losses of switching from the status quo more heavily than the potential gains; this is due to the prospect theory value function being steeper in the loss domain.&lt;ref name=Samuelson/&gt;  As a result, the individual will prefer not to switch at all. In other words, we tend to oppose change unless the benefits outweigh the risks. However, the status quo bias is maintained even in the absence of gain/loss framing: for example, when subjects were asked to choose the colour of their new car, they tended towards one colour arbitrarily framed as the status quo.&lt;ref name=Samuelson/&gt; Loss aversion, therefore, cannot wholly explain the status quo bias,&lt;ref name=Korobkin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Korobkin | first1 = R.  | year = 1997 | title = The status quo bias and contract default rules | url =http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Korobkin-2.pdf | journal = Cornell Law Review | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 608–687 |ssrn=52240}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other potential causes including regret avoidance,&lt;ref name=Korobkin/&gt; [[transaction cost]]s&lt;ref name=Tversky&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tversky | first1 = A. | last2 = Kahneman | first2 = D. | year = 1991 | title = Loss aversion in riskless choice: a reference-dependent model | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 1039–1061 | doi=10.2307/2937956}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychological commitment.&lt;ref name=Samuelson/&gt;

===Rational routes to status quo maintenance===

A status quo bias can also be a rational route if there are cognitive or informational limitations.

;Informational limitations
Decision outcomes are rarely certain, nor is the utility they may bring. Because some errors are more costly than others (Haselton &amp; Nettle, 2006),&lt;ref name="HaseltonNettle2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haselton|first1=Martie G.|last2=Nettle|first2=Daniel|title=The Paranoid Optimist: An Integrative Evolutionary Model of Cognitive Biases|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=10|issue=1|year=2006|pages=47–66|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_3|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/PSPR2006.pdf|pmid=16430328}}&lt;/ref&gt; sticking with what worked in the past is a safe option, as long as previous decisions are "good enough".&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=H.A.|title=Rational Choice and the Structure of the Environment|journal=Psychological Review|date=March 1956|volume=63|issue=2|pages=129–138|doi=10.1037/h0042769|pmid=13310708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cognitive limitations
Choice is often difficult,&lt;ref name=Iyengar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iyengar|first=Sheena|author2=Lepper, Mark R |title=When choice is demotivating: Can one desire too much of a good thing?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=December 2000|volume=79|issue=6|pages=995–1006|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decision makers may prefer to do nothing&lt;ref name=baron&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=Jonathan|author2=Ilana Ritov |title=Omission bias, individual differences, and normality|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=2004|volume=94|pages=74–85|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2004.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and/or to maintain their current course of action because it is easier.&lt;ref name=Samuelson /&gt;
Status quo alternatives often require less mental effort to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelman &amp; Crandall, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrational routes===
The irrational maintenance of the status quo bias links and confounds many cognitive biases.

;Existence bias
An assumption of longevity and goodness are part of the status quo bias.  People treat [[existence]] as a prima facie case for goodness, aesthetic and longevity increases this preference.&lt;ref name="EidelmanCrandall2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eidelman|first1=Scott|last2=Crandall|first2=Christian S.|title=Bias in Favor of the Status Quo|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=6|issue=3|year=2012|pages=270–281|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2012.00427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The status quo bias affects people's preferences; people report preferences for what they are likely rather than unlikely to receive. People simply assume, with little reason or deliberation, the goodness of existing
states.&lt;ref name="EidelmanCrandall2012" /&gt;

[[Longevity]] is a corollary of the existence bias: if existence is good, longer existence should be better. This thinking resembles quasi-evolutionary notions of "survival of the fittest", and also the augmentation principle in attribution theory.&lt;ref name="Kelley1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Harold H.|title=Attribution in Social Interaction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_0_AAAAMAAJ|year=1971|publisher=General Learning Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inertia]] is another reason used to explain a bias towards the status quo. Another explanation is fear of regret in making a wrong decision, i.e.  If we choose a partner, when we think there could be someone better out there.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Venkatesh|first=B.|title=Benefitting from status quo bias}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Unclear attribution to news article|date=November 2014}}

===Mere exposure===
[[Mere exposure]] is an explanation for the status quo bias.  Existing states are encountered more frequently than non-existent states and because of this they will be perceived as more true and evaluated more preferably.
One way to increase liking for something is repeated exposure over time.&lt;ref name=exposure&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bornstein|first=R.F.|title=Exposure and affect: Overview and meta- analysis of research|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1989|volume=106|pages=265–289|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.2.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Loss aversion
'''[[Loss aversion]]''' also leads to greater regret for action than for inaction;&lt;ref name="KahnemanSlovicTversky1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Slovic|first2=Paul|last3=Tversky|first3=Amos|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0H8gwj4a1MC|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28414-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; more
regret is experienced when a decision changes the status quo than when it maintains it.&lt;ref name=inman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inman|first=J.J.|author2=Zeelenberg |title=Regret repeat versus switch decisions: The attenuation role of decision justifiability|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=2002|volume=29|pages=116–128|doi=10.1086/339925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these forces provide an advantage for the status quo; people are motivated to do nothing or to maintain current or previous decisions.&lt;ref name=Samuelson /&gt; Change is avoided, and decision makers stick with what has been done in the past.

Changes from the status quo will typically involve both gains and losses, with the change having good overall consequences if the gains outweigh these losses. A tendency to overemphasize the avoidance of losses will thus favour retaining the status quo, resulting in a status quo bias. Even though choosing the status quo may entail forfeiting certain positive consequences, when these are represented as forfeited "gains" they are psychologically given less weight than the "losses" that would be incurred if the status quo were changed.&lt;ref name="BostromOrd2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|last2=Ord|first2=Toby|title=The Reversal Test: Eliminating Status Quo Bias in Applied Ethics|journal=Ethics|volume=116|issue=4|year=2006|pages=656–679|doi=10.1086/505233|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/691705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Omission bias
[[Omission bias]] may account for some of the findings previously ascribed to status quo bias.
Omission bias is diagnosed when a decision maker prefers a harmful outcome that results from an omission to a less harmful outcome that results from an action.&lt;ref&gt;Ilana Ritov and Jonathan Baron, "Status-Quo and Omission Biases," Journal of Risk and Uncertainty 5 [1992]: 49–61)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection===
'''[[Reversal test|The Reversal Test]]''': When a proposal to change a certain parameter is thought to have bad overall consequences, consider a change to the same parameter in the opposite direction. If this is also thought to have bad overall consequences, then the onus is on those who reach these conclusions to explain why our position cannot be improved through changes to this parameter. If they are unable to do so, then we have reason to suspect that they suffer from status quo bias. The rationale of the Reversal Test is: if a continuous parameter admits of a wide range of possible values, only a tiny subset of which can be local optima, then it is prima facie implausible that the actual value of that parameter should just happen to be at one of these rare local optima.&lt;ref name="BostromOrd2006" /&gt;

===Neural activity===
A study found that erroneous status quo rejections have a greater neural impact than erroneous status quo acceptances.  This asymmetry in the genesis of regret might drive the status quo bias on subsequent decisions.&lt;ref name="NicolleFleming2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicolle|first1=A.|last2=Fleming|first2=S. M.|last3=Bach|first3=D. R.|last4=Driver|first4=J.|last5=Dolan|first5=R. J.|title=A Regret-Induced Status Quo Bias|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=31|issue=9|year=2011|pages=3320–3327|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5615-10.2011|pmid=21368043|pmc=3059787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done using a visual detection task in which subjects tended to favour the default when making difficult, but not easy, decisions. This bias was suboptimal in that more errors were made when the default was accepted. A selective increase in [[Subthalamic nucleus|sub-thalamic nucleus]] (STN) activity was found when the status quo was rejected in the face of heightened decision difficulty. Analysis of effective connectivity showed that inferior [[frontal cortex]], a region more active for difficult decisions, exerted an enhanced modulatory influence on the STN during switches away from the status quo.&lt;ref name=Neural /&gt;

Research by [[University College London]] scientists that examines the neural pathways involved in 'status quo bias' in the human brain and found that the more difficult the decision we face, the more likely we are not to act.
The study, published in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (PNAS), looked at the decision-making of participants taking part in a tennis 'line judgement' game while their brains were scanned using [[functional MRI]] (fMRI).
The 16 study participants were asked to look at a cross between two tramlines on a screen while holding down a 'default' key. They then saw a ball land in the court and had to make a decision as to whether it was in or out. On each trial, the computer signalled which was the current default option – 'in' or 'out'. The participants continued to hold down the key to accept the default and had to release it and change to another key to reject the default.
The results showed a consistent bias towards the default, which led to errors. As the task became more difficult, the bias became even more pronounced. The fMRI scans showed that a region of the brain known as the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) was more active in the cases when the default was rejected. Also, greater flow of information was seen from a separate region sensitive to difficulty (the [[prefrontal cortex]]) to the STN. This indicates that the STN plays a key role in overcoming status quo bias when the decision is difficult.&lt;ref name=Neural&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleming, Stephen|author2=C. Thomas |author3=R. Dolan |title=Overcoming Status Quo Bias in the Human Brain|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=February 2010|volume=107|issue=13|pages=6005–6009|doi=10.1073/pnas.0910380107|pmid=20231462|pmc=2851882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral economics and the default position===
Against this background, two [[Behavioral economics|behavioral economists]] devised an opt-out plan to help employees of a particular company build their retirement savings. In an opt-out plan, the employees are automatically enrolled unless they explicitly ask to be excluded. They found evidence for status quo bias and other associated effects. They also noted that changing the default alternatives has, in some instances, been shown to have dramatic effects on people’s choices.&lt;ref name="save more"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thaler|first=Richard H.|author2=Shlomo Benartzi |title=Save More Tomorrow: Using Behavioural Economics to Increase Employee Saving|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=2004|volume=112|pages=164–187|doi=10.1086/380085}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2012}}

===Conflict===
Status-quo educational bias can be both a barrier to political progress and a threat to the state's legitimacy and argue that the values of stability, compliance, and patriotism underpin important reasons for status quo bias that appeal not to the substantive merits of existing institutions but merely to the fact that those institutions are the status quo.&lt;ref name="civic edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacMullen|title=On Status-Quo Bias in Civic Education|journal=Journal of Politics|year= 2011|volume=73|issue=3|pages=872–886|doi=10.1017/s0022381611000521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevant fields==

The Status quo bias is seen in important real life decisions; it has been found to be prominent is data on selections of health care plans and retirement programs.&lt;ref name=Samuelson /&gt;

===Politics===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
Some{{Who|date=August 2018}} believe that preference for the status quo represents a core component of [[Conservatism|conservative ideology]] in societies where government power is limited and laws restricting actions of individuals exist. Conversely, in [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[liberalism|liberal]] societies, movements to impose restrictions on individuals or governments are met with widespread opposition by those that favor the status quo. Reardless of the type of society, the bias tends to hinder [[progressivism|progressive]] movements in the absence of a [[Reactance (psychology)|reaction]] or backlash against [[The powers that be (phrase)|the powers that be]].

===Ethics===
Status quo bias may be responsible for much of the opposition to human enhancement in general and to genetic cognitive enhancement in particular.&lt;ref name="BostromOrd2006" /&gt; Some ethicists argue, however, that status quo bias may not be irrational in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Nebel | first = Jacob | year = 2015 | title = Status Quo Bias, Rationality, and Conservatism about Value | journal = Ethics | volume = 125 | issue = 2 | pages = 449–476 | doi= 10.1086/678482|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/NEBSQB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationality of status quo bias is also an important question in the ethics of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wasserman | first= David| year= 2015 | title= Disability, Diversity, and Preference for the Status Quo: Bias or Justifiable Preference? | journal = American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 11–12. | doi=10.1080/15265161.2015.1028676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Education can (sometimes unintentionally) encourage children’s belief in the substantive merits of a particular existing law or political institution, where the effect does not derive from an improvement in their ability or critical thinking about that law or institution. However, this biasing effect is not automatically illegitimate or counterproductive: a balance between social inculcation and openness needs to be maintained.&lt;ref name="civic edu" /&gt;

In elementary schools, reading aloud sessions that exclude ethnically diverse materials create a bias in favor of the status quo that is harmful to children's education.&lt;ref name=reading&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez-Jensen|first=Margarita|author2=Sadler, Norma |title=Behind Closed Doors: Status Quo Bias in Read Aloud Selections|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=April 1997|volume=30|issue=1|pages=27–31|doi=10.1080/1066568970300104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
An experiment to determine if status-quo bias—bias toward current medication even when better alternatives are offered—exists in a stated-choice study among asthma patients who take prescription combination maintenance medications.
The results of this study indicate that the status quo bias may exist in stated-choice studies, especially with medications that patients have to take daily such as asthma maintenance medications. Stated-choice practitioners should include a current medication in choice surveys to control for this bias.&lt;ref name="MohamedHauber2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohamed|first1=AF|last2=Hauber|first2=AB|last3=Johnson|first3=FR|last4=Meddis|first4=D|last5=Wagner|first5=S|title=Status Quo Bias in Stated Choice Studies: Is it Real?|journal=Value in Health|volume=11|issue=6|year=2008|pages=A567–A568|doi=10.1016/S1098-3015(10)66867-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement plans===
An example of the status quo bias affecting retirement plans is a study done that examined the U.S. equity mutual fund.  They found that people maintained the plan they had previously, even if it was no longer the optimal choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kempf|first=Alexandre|author2=Stefan Ruenzi |title=Status Quo Bias and the Number of Alternatives: An Empirical Illustration from the Mutual Fund Industry|journal=Journal of Behavioral Finance|year=2006|volume=7|issue=4|pages=204–213|doi=10.1207/s15427579jpfm0704_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26798">'''The Irascibles''' or '''Irascible 18''' were the labels given to a group of American abstract artists who put name to an [[open letter]], written in 1950, to the president of [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], rejecting the museum's exhibition ''American Painting Today - 1950'' and boycotting the accompanying competition. The subsequent media coverage of the protest and a now iconic group photograph, that appeared in ''Life'' magazine, gave them notoriety, popularised the term [[Abstract Expressionist]] and established them as the so-called first generation of the putative movement.

==The emergence of the New York School==
The emergence of abstract art coincided with the invention of [[Cubism]] in Paris in the first decade of the 20th Century. Paris remained the centre of gravity for later art movements like [[Futurism]], [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Vorticism]], [[Cubo-Futurism]], [[Dada]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Surrealism]] until the outbreak of World War II and the Nazi persecution of "[[degenerate art]]", which precipitated a mass migration of artists and performers to the United States. New York became home to the transplanted avant-garde.&lt;ref name=Barnes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Lucinda|title=A Proclamation of Moment: Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rottko and Barnett Newman and the letter to ''The New York Times''|journal=Allen Memorial Art Museum Bulletin|year=1993|volume=XLVII|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 1940s was of particular importance in American art as American scene painting ([[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]]) came to be seen as an inadequate mode of artistic expression in a tumultuous time.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt; In 1942, [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who had fled Europe with her husband, Surrealist artist [[Max Ernst]], opened her gallery [[Art of This Century gallery|Art of This Century]], showing European and promising American avant-garde artists. [[Jackson Pollock]] had his first one-man show there in 1943 and, in 1945, Guggenheim showed [[Mark Rothko]].&lt;ref name=Barnes /&gt;

When Guggenheim closed her gallery in 1947 to move to Venice, artists like Pollock had to find new representation. The Betty Parsons Gallery, which opened the previous year, began representing Pollock, [[Barnett Newman]], Mark Rothko and [[Clyfford Still]]. Parsons was already representing [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hedda Sterne]] and [[Theodoros Stamos]]. It was while Pollock showed at Parsons' gallery that he started making his iconic drip-paintings in 1947. It was also here that Barnett Newman exhibited his first breakthrough works in 1950. Rothko, who had arrived at his distinctive mural sized paintings in 1947, first exhibited them at the Parsons Gallery.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt;

At the time, the only galleries who were prepared to show the so-called [[New York School (art)|New York School]] ([[Robert Motherwell]]'s term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the [[Charles Egan Gallery]]. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest price paid for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with the sale of a $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, [[Hans Hoffman]], [[William Baziotes]] and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 as a result of the financial strain.&lt;ref name=Robson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robson|first=Deirdre|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415228671|pages=290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vp-eUH_ogUsC|editor=Francis Frascina|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical and financial success of the group would only come after a series of popularising articles in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;

==The preamble to the protest==
Since January 1943 an agreement existed between the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] on a coalition which would culminate in the combining of their collections of American art in a new building, paid for from the endowment of [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]]. By this unwritten agreement, the Whitney acquired American art while the Metropolitan concentrated their acquisitions on what they termed "classic" art.&lt;ref name=Hale /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hale1957 /&gt;

Juliana Force, the Whitney's director since 1931 until her death on August 28, 1948, harboured grave concerns and advocated the abandonment of the coalition. On October 1, 1948, the Whitney trustees cited "serious divergences" especially with regard to the showing of advanced trends in art, something the Whitney made a special point of doing. They unilaterally withdrew the Whitney from the coalition.&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;{{cite news|title=Whitney Drops Proposal for Combining its Collections with the Metropolitan's|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/10/01/96599374.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 October 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 1948, the Met announced it would form its own Department of American Art,&lt;ref name=NYT1948&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=Art Museum adds a Modern Section|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/12/07/96606328.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 December 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it did on January 1, 1949.&lt;ref name=Hale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hale|first=Robert Beverly|title=A Report on American Painting Today: 1950|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=February 1951|volume=9|series=New series|issue=6|pages=162–172|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|jstor=3257446|doi=10.2307/3257446}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Beverly Hale]] was appointed as Associate Curator of American Painting and Sculpture and head of the department.&lt;ref name=NYT1948 /&gt; A Trustees' Committee on American Art was set up to advise the Associate Curator.

In July 1949, Roland J. McKinney, formerly Director of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] and of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], was appointed as a consultant.&lt;ref name=Knox /&gt; On his advice, it was decided The Met would host a series of open national competitive exhibitions with five regional juries. The first of these, ''American Painting Today - 1950'', was announced as part of a statement of policy on January 1, 1950.&lt;ref name=Knox&gt;{{cite news|last=Knox|first=Sanka|title=Competition for American Artists Planned by Metropolitan Museum|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/01/01/109354653.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 January 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five regional juries, meeting respectively in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Dallas]], [[Chicago]], Richmond and [[New York City|New York]] would make selections, which would be submitted to a National Jury, composed of five regional jurors and two jurors appointment by the Metropolitan.&lt;ref name=Hale /&gt;

==The Studio 35 symposium==
In 1948, William Baziotes, [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and Mark Rothko founded the Subjects of the Artist School, which held artists' discussions in a loft at 35 East Eighth Street, [[Manhattan]] which came to be known as Studio 35. A closed panel symposium took place from April 21 to 23, 1950. It was organised by [[Robert Goodnough]] and moderated by [[Richard Lippold]], Robert Motherwell and [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]] director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA). The purpose was the framing of an [[art movement]].&lt;ref name=Swan&gt;{{cite book|title=de Kooning: American Master|year=2005|publisher=Alfred A.

At the end of the closed session it was suggested by Adolph Gottlieb that the assembled artists protest the conservative bias of the jury for the upcoming competition at the Metropolitan.&lt;ref name=Alloway&gt;{{cite book|last=Alloway|first=Lawrence|title=Adolph Gottlieb: A Retrospective|year=1995|publisher=Hudson Hills|isbn=9781555951252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_XppsXbW5AC&amp;dq=Adolph+Gottlieb:+A+Retrospective&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|author2=MacNaughton, Mary |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}}

Redmond, May 20, 1950, unsigned copy from the [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/open-letter-to-roland-l-redmond-president-metropolitan-museum-art-9959 Hedda Sterne papers], typed, 28 x 22 cm]]
Gottlieb spent the better part of three weeks drafting an [[open letter]] to the president of the Metropolitan, conferring with [[Ad Reinhardt]] and Barnett Newman while soliciting consensus among other artists by mail or phone. The final version was sent to the individual artists to sign; 28 doing so. Newman called Jackson Pollock from Gottlieb's apartment in Brooklyn, asking him to come into the city immediately to sign the letter. Pollock sent a telegram instead:&lt;ref name=Pollock&gt;{{cite book|title=Jackson Pollock: An American Saga|year=1989|publisher=Clarkson N.

{{quote|I ENDORSED THE LETTER OPPOSING THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART 1950 JURIED SHOW STOP JACKSON POLLOCK}}

The letter was underwritten by [[Jimmy Ernst]], Adolph Gottlieb, Robert Motherwell, William Baziotes, Hans Hofmann, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], Theodoros Stamos, [[Ad Reinhardt]], Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Weldon Kees]] and [[Fritz Bultman]]. The supporting sculptors were [[Herbert Ferber]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Mary Callery]], Day Schnabel, [[Seymour Lipton]], [[Peter Grippe]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], David Hare and [[Louise Bourgeois]].&lt;ref name=NYT1950 /&gt;

On Sunday May 21, 1950, Barnett Newman took the signed statement to the [[city editor]] of the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Alloway /&gt; Newman had run for mayor of New York as a [[write-in candidate]] in 1933 and knew Monday to be a slow news day at the ''Times''.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Barnett|title=Barnett Newman: Selected Writings and Interviews|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520078178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaJ1niWLPHMC&amp;dq=Barnett+Newman+mayor&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|editor=John Philip O'Neill|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement, entitled OPEN LETTER TO ROLAND L. REDMOND, dated May 20, appeared on the front page of the ''Times'' of May 22.&lt;ref name=NYT1950&gt;{{cite news|title=18 Painters Boycott Metropolitan; Charge 'Hostility to Advanced Art'|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/05/22/94259585.pdf|accessdate=25 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 May 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman told the ''Times'' that they were critical of the membership of the five regional juries and especially opposed to the New York jury, the National Jury of Selection and the Jury of Awards. The New York jurors were [[Charles Burchfield]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], [[Leon Kroll]], [[Ogden Pleissner]], Vaclav Vytlacil and [[Paul Sample (artist)|Paul Sample]]. The national jury consisted of Robert Beverly Hale, Ogden Pleissner, [[Maurice Sterne]], [[Millard Sheets]], [[Howard Cook]], [[Lamar Dodd]], [[Francis Chapin]], Zoltan Sepeshy and Esther Williams. The jury of awards included William M. Milliken, Franklin C. Watkins and [[Eugene Speicher]].&lt;ref name=NYT1950 /&gt;

==The resulting polemic==
The first response to the letter came on the editorial page of ''[[New York Herald Tribune|The Herald Tribune]]'' of May 23, 1950. The editorial attacked the artists for "distortion of fact" in claiming the Metropolitan had "contempt" for modern painting.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite news|title=The Irascible Eighteen|newspaper=The New York Herald Tribune|date=23 May 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Herald Tribune's'' art critic at the time was [[Emily Genauer]]. It was widely assumed that she had written the editorial, which gave name to the group.&lt;ref name=Rubenfeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubenfeld|first=Florence|title=Clement Greenberg: a life|year=1997|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=9780684191102|pages=144|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL689412M/Clement_Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boxer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=Sarah|title=The Last Irascible|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=23 December 2010|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/dec/23/last-irascible/?pagination=false|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gottlieb, aided by Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which was signed by 12 painters and three sculptors, and addressed to the editor of the ''Tribune''. It was never published. Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of ''[[The Nation]]'', calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, [[Francis Henry Taylor]] a [[Philistinism|philistine]].&lt;ref name=Kees&gt;{{cite book|last=Kees|first=Weldon|title=Weldon Kees and the Mid-Century Generation: Letters, 1935-1955|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=9780803278080|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsdhebykYgUC&amp;dq=Weldon+Kees+the+Nation+June+3+1950&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|editor=Robert E. Knoll|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}} Two days later ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted the protest in an article entitled ''The Revolt of the Pelicans'',&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=The Revolt of the Pelicans|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812593,00.html|accessdate=27 November 2012|newspaper=Time|date=5 June 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 comments in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''.

Alfred Barr, seeking to distinguish the MoMA, further electrified the situation by selecting [[Arshile Gorky]], Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock for the American pavilion of the 25th [[Venice Biennale]], held from June to October 1950. In the June 1950 issue of ''[[ARTnews]]'', he referred to the painters as "leaders" of a "predominant vanguard". Barr's act signalled to the art world that [[abstract expressionism]] should be given serious consideration by museums.&lt;ref name=Swan /&gt;{{rp|305–306}}

On July 3, 1950, a group of 75 artists issued a statement via an open letter to the president of the Met, defending the museum. Signers included [[Milton Avery]], [[Will Barnet]], [[Philip Evergood]], [[Xavier Gonzalez]], [[George Grosz]], [[Henry Koerner]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Waldo Peirce]], [[Manfred Schwartz]] and [[Harry Sternberg]].&lt;ref name=75artists&gt;{{cite news|title=75 Painters Deny Museum is Hostile|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/07/04/84661775.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 July 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Life'' magazine decided to publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document the results of the competition and feature a photograph of the protesters.&lt;ref name=Life&gt;{{cite journal|title=IRASCIBLE GROUP OF ADVANCED ARTISTS LED FIGHT AGAINST SHOW|journal=Life|date=15 January 1951|pages=34–38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20sEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life'' initially wanted to photograph the painters on the steps of the ''Metropolitan'', with their paintings.

They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman.&lt;ref name=Alloway /&gt;{{rp|49}} Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.&lt;ref name=Pollock /&gt;{{rp|602}}

Nina Leen took twelve pictures, of which one appeared in ''Life''. Barnett Newman had insisted that the group be photographed "like bankers". The artists were allowed to position themselves.&lt;ref name=Rothko /&gt;{{rp|272}} [[Hedda Sterne]], who had arrived late, is seen in the back (standing on a table). She is the only woman in the photograph and would later describe the experience as "probably the worst thing that happened to me".&lt;ref name=Boxer /&gt; Painter [[Lee Krasner]] believed Sterne was allowed at the insistence of art dealer [[Betty Parsons]], who represented many in the group.&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Gail|title=Lee Krasner: A Biography|year=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=9780061845253|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Lee_Krasner.html?id=XeX6DdT-mRQC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|402}}

The caption to the published photograph referred to the group as ''solemn''. It was true that many of the group had reservations at appearing in a [[mainstream media]] publication; Rothko especially.&lt;ref name=Rothko /&gt;{{rp|272}} Yet none could have mistaken the consequences of Pollock's three-page spread in ''Life'' of August 8, 1949.&lt;ref name=LifeJP&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jackson Pollock: Is he the greatest living painter in the United States?|journal=Life|date=8 August 1949|volume=27|issue=6|pages=42–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y04EAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=Life+jackson+pollock+is+he+the+greatest&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=29 November 2012|publisher=Time Inc.|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock's next show, opening November 21, 1949, at ''Betty Parsons Gallery'', was an unmistakable triumph.&lt;ref name=Pollock /&gt;{{rp|597}} Famously, Willem de Kooning was heard to say to [[Milton Resnick]]: "Look around.

In the end the sitting was an uncomfortable accommodation between the system of values under which the artists had laboured and their desire for career success.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;

==The legacy of the polemic==
The subsequent ''Life'' article did more than provide the public with an image of the group, looking more "like bankers" than irascible. It placed the picture larger and before the pictures of the Metropolitans competition winning art works. It also reiterated the word ''advanced'', echoing the [[Madison Avenue]] advertising speak of the day.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; The picture caption also referred to the protest as in keeping with [[avant-garde]] tradition, mentioning the [[Salon des Refusés]] of 1863 and the [[Ashcan School]].&lt;ref name=Life /&gt;

[[Irving Sandler]], a historian of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and Abstract Expressionism wrote that the Leen photograph "has become ''the'' image whereby we invision the artists who achieved the triumph of American painting".&lt;ref name=Sandler&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandler|first=Irving|title=Weldon Kees and the Arts at Midcentury|year=2003|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803242951|pages=39–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHuqFs0f9TsC&amp;dq|editor=Daniel A. Siedell|accessdate=29 November 2012|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}

The artists' discomfort with being labelled, individually or as a group, was clear. At the end of the three-day symposium at Studio 35 in 1950, Alfred Barr challenged the group to name themselves, to which de Kooning responded: "it is disastrous to name ourselves".&lt;ref name=Swan /&gt;{{rp|305}} Pollock, on his part, refused to sign the ''Times'' letter unless it was clear that they were not a group; it is noteworthy that he did not.&lt;ref name=Sandler /&gt;{{rp|42}}

Already in 1951, relationships had deteriorated enough for Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons with the idea of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to fend for themselves.&lt;ref name=Tomkins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomkins|first=Calvin|title=A Keeper of the Treasure|journal=The New Yorker|date=9 June 1975|pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the [[Sidney Janis Gallery]].&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt; After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not being included in the 1952 ''Fifteen Americans'' show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not show in New York again until 1959.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothko /&gt;{{rp|346}}

In 1954, Ad Reinhardt engaged in a public ridiculing of Rothko, Newman, de Kooning, Gottlieb and Still, resulting in Newman suing him for libel.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothko /&gt;{{rp|347}} Clyfford Still repudiated Mark Rothko for "living an evil, an untrue life".&lt;ref name=Rothko /&gt;{{rp|348}} "It all went from love to hate in four years", Betty Parsons recalled in 1975.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt;

Nina Leen's 1951 ''Life'' photograph has become the [[Touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] for [[Western canon|canonical]] lists of the New York School. Irving Sandler used it as the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] and rear [[dust jacket]] photograph of his ''The Triumph of American Painting: A History of Abstract Expressionism'', published in 1970.&lt;ref name=Triumph&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandler|first=Irving|title=The Triumph of American Painting: a History of Abstract Expressionism|year=1970|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL17754003M/The_triumph_of_American_painting}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book defined Abstract Expressionism for a generation of scholars.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Ann Eden|title=Abstract Expressionism: Other Politics|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=0300063393|pages=29|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1006293M/Abstract_expressionism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon]] (1986), ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford UP, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel never used the term himself. It originated with [[Johann Fichte]].&lt;ref name=Fichte&gt;"Review of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]''" ([http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/fichte/jgf-aenesidemus.html "Rezension des Aenesidemus"], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung|de}}'', February 11–12, 1794). Trans. Daniel Breazeale. In {{cite book| last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between the three abstract terms of the triad, also known as the [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|dialectical method]], is summarized in the following way in the ''Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hegel's Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis Model |pages=978 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8265-8_200183 |last1=Schnitker |first1=Sarah A. |last2=Emmons |first2=Robert A. |isbn=978-1-4020-8264-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) a beginning proposition called a thesis, (2) a negation of that thesis called the antithesis, and (3) a synthesis whereby the two conflicting ideas are reconciled to form a new proposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of the idea==
[[Thomas McFarland]] (2002), in his ''Prolegomena'' to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''Opus Maximum'',&lt;ref name=STC&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge: ''Opus Maximum''. Princeton University Press, 2002, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Kritik der reinen Vernunft]]'' (1781) as the genesis of the thesis/antithesis dyad.  Kant concretises his ideas into:
* Thesis: "The world has a beginning in time, and is limited with regard to space."
* Antithesis: "The world has no beginning and no limits in space, but is infinite, in respect to both time and space."

Inasmuch as conjectures like these can be said to be resolvable, [[Fichte]]'s ''Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre'' (''Foundations of the Science of Knowledge'', 1794) resolved Kant's dyad by synthesis, posing the question thus:&lt;ref name=STC/&gt;

* ''Are synthetic judgments a priori possible?''
** No synthesis is possible without a preceding antithesis.  As little as antithesis without synthesis, or synthesis without antithesis, is possible; just as little possible are both without thesis.
Fichte employed the triadic idea "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" as a formula for the explanation of change.&lt;ref name=Ritter&gt;[[Harry Ritter]], ''Dictionary of Concepts in History''. Greenwood Publishing Group (1986), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Fichte was the first to use the trilogy of words together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Robert R.|title=Recognition: Fichte and Hegel on the Other|date=1992|publisher=SUNY Press|page=46, note 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''Grundriss des Eigentümlichen der Wissenschaftslehre, in Rücksicht auf das theoretische Vermögen'' (1795, ''Outline of the Distinctive Character of the Wissenschaftslehre with respect to the Theoretical Faculty''): "Die jetzt aufgezeigte Handlung ist '''thetisch, antithetisch und synthetisch''' zugleich." ["The action here described is simultaneously thetic, antithetic, and synthetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fichte|first1=Johann Gottlieb|last2=Breazeale|first2=Daniel|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

Still according to McFarland, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] then, in his ''Vom Ich als Prinzip der Philosophie'' (1795), arranged the terms schematically in pyramidal form.

According to [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), although the triad is often thought to form part of an [[analysis]] of historical and philosophical progress called the Hegelian [[dialectic]], the assumption is erroneous:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Walter Kaufmann|authorlink= Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|title= Hegel: A Reinterpretation|year= 1966|publisher= [[Anchor Books]]|chapter= § 37|isbn= 978-0-268-01068-3|oclc= 3168016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Whoever looks for the stereotype of the allegedly Hegelian dialectic in Hegel's ''Phenomenology'' will not find it. What one does find on looking at the table of contents is a very decided preference for triadic arrangements. ... But these many triads are not presented or deduced by Hegel as so many theses, antitheses, and syntheses. It is not by means of any dialectic of that sort that his thought moves up the ladder to '''[[absolute knowledge]]'''.}}

[[Gustav E. Mueller]] (1958) concurs that Hegel was not a proponent of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, and clarifies what the concept of dialectic might have meant in Hegel's thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Gustav|title=The Hegel Legend of "Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis"|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|date=1958|volume=19|issue=4|pages=411–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Dialectic" does not for Hegel mean "thesis, antithesis, and synthesis." Dialectic means that any "ism" – which has a polar opposite, or is a special viewpoint leaving "the rest" to itself – must be criticized by the logic of philosophical thought, whose problem is reality as such, the "World-itself".}}

According to Mueller, the attribution of this tripartite dialectic to Hegel is the result of "inept reading" and simplistic translations which do not take into account the genesis of Hegel's terms: 
{{quote|Hegel's greatness is as indisputable as his obscurity. The matter is due to his peculiar terminology and style; they are undoubtedly involved and complicated, and seem excessively abstract. These linguistic troubles, in turn, have given rise to legends which are like perverse and magic spectacles - once you wear them, the text simply vanishes. Theodor Haering's monumental and standard work has for the first time cleared up the linguistic problem. By carefully analyzing every sentence from his early writings, which were published only in this century, he has shown how Hegel's terminology evolved - though it was complete when he began to publish. Hegel's contemporaries were immediately baffled, because what was clear to him was not clear to his readers, who were not initiated into the genesis of his terms.

An example of how a legend can grow on inept reading is this: Translate "Begriff" by "concept," "Vernunft" by "reason" and "Wissenschaft" by "science" – and they are all good dictionary translations – and you have transformed the great critic of rationalism ''and'' irrationalism into a ridiculous champion of an absurd pan-logistic rationalism and scientism.

The most vexing and devastating Hegel legend is that everything is thought in "thesis, antithesis, and synthesis."&lt;ref&gt;Mueller 1958, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820–1895) adopted and extended the triad, especially in Marx's ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847).

{{See also|Rogerian argument}}
In modern times, the dialectic of ''thesis, antithesis, and synthesis'' has been implemented across the world as a strategy for organizing expositional writing. For example, this technique is taught as a basic organizing principle in French schools:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nadeau|first1=Jean-Benoit|last2=Barlow|first2=Julie|title=Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong: Why We Love France But Not The French|date=2003|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The French learn to value and practice eloquence from a young age. Almost from day one, students are taught to produce plans for their compositions, and are graded on them. The structures change with fashions. Youngsters were once taught to express a progression of ideas. Now they follow a dialectic model of thesis-antithesis-synthesis. If you listen carefully to the French arguing about any topic they all follow this model closely: they present an idea, explain possible objections to it, and then sum up their conclusions. ... This analytical mode of reasoning is integrated into the entire school corpus.}}

Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis has also been used as a basic scheme to organize writing in the English language. For example, the website WikiPreMed.com advocates the use of this scheme in writing timed essays for the MCAT standardized test:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The MCAT writing assignment.|url=http://www.wikipremed.com/mcat_essay.php|website=WikiPreMed|publisher=Wisebridge Learning Systems, LLC|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For the purposes of writing MCAT essays, the dialectic describes the progression of ideas in a critical thought process that is the force driving your argument. A good dialectical progression propels your arguments in a way that is satisfying to the reader.

:The thesis is an intellectual proposition.
:The antithesis is a critical perspective on the thesis.
:The synthesis solves the conflict between the thesis and antithesis by reconciling their common truths, and forming a new proposition. }}

==Timeline of feminism==
;1848-1920
* [[First-wave feminism]] was a period of feminist activity and thought that occurred within the 19th and early 20th century throughout the world. It focused on legal issues, primarily on gaining women's suffrage (the right to vote).
; 1960s
* 1963: ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published; it is a book written by [[Betty Friedan]] which is widely credited with starting the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85|date=5 February 2006|author=Margalit Fox|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jwa.org/thisweek/feb/17/1963/betty-friedan|title=Publication of "The Feminine Mystique" by Betty Friedan - Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second-wave feminism was a period of feminist activity and thought that began in the early 1960s in the United States, and spread throughout the Western world and beyond. In the United States the movement lasted through the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Gamble, ed. ''The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism'' (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Black feminism]] became popular because of the exclusion from the civil rights movement and the feminist movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} 
* [[Radical feminism]] emerged in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willis|first=Ellen|author-link=Ellen Willis|title=Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism |journal=Social Text |volume=9/10: The 60's without Apology |issue=9/10|year=1984|pages=91–118|jstor=466537}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: "The Discontent of Women", by [[Joke Smit|Joke Kool-Smits]], was published&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/js/werk/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;; the publication of this essay is often regarded as the start of [[second-wave feminism]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/joke-smit-feministe-en-journaliste|title=Joke Smit: feministe en journaliste|date=6 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Smit describes the frustration of married women, saying they are fed up being solely mothers and housewives.
* 1969: [[Chicana feminism]], also called Xicanisma, is a sociopolitical movement in the United States that analyzes the historical, cultural, spiritual, educational, and economic intersections of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women that identify as [[Chicano|Chicana]]. The 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference began the [[Chicano movement]] and eventually, [[MEChA]]. At the conference, women began to get involved in the male-dominated dialogue to address feminist concerns. After the conference, women returned to their communities as activists and thus began the Chicana feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement|url=http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|publisher=The University of Michigan|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; 1970s
*  In the 1970s, [[Feminism in France|French feminist]] theorists approached feminism with the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as female, or feminine writing).&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;Wright, Elizabeth (2000). ''Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters)''. Totem Books or Icon Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84046-182-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
; 1980s
* The [[radical lesbian]] movement is a [[francophone]] lesbian movement roughly analogous to [[English-language]] lesbian separatism. Inspired by the writings of philosopher [[Monique Wittig]],&lt;ref&gt;Turcotte, Louise. (foreword) ''The Straight Mind and Other Essays'', Monique Wittig, Beacon Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-8070-7917-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;ix&lt;/ref&gt; the movement originated in [[France]] in the early 1980s, spreading soon after to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]].

Press) 2003) pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; [[second-wave feminism]] began in the 1980s.
* [[Difference feminism]] was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as "[[equality feminism]]"), which emphasizes the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it is still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasizes the differences between men and women and argues that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminism aims to make society and law gender-neutral, since it sees recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism holds that gender-neutrality harms women "whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tirthika''' ([[Sanskrit]]: tīrthika, [[Pali]]: titthiya, "ford-maker," meaning one who is attempting to cross the stream of [[samsara]]&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien. Oxford ''Dictionary of Buddhism'' (2004), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;) is a general term referring to heretics, or non-Buddhists in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhammajoti|first=KL|title=Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma|date=2007|publisher=Centre of Buddhist Studies at the University of Hong Kong|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-988-99296-1-9|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tipitaka, the term may refer specifically to adherents of [[Jainism]]. Whereas a Buddhist takes [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the [[Three Jewels]] and treads the [[middle way]] between extremes, a tirthika does not.

According to the ''Asoka Avadhana'', the tirthikas that were jealous of [[Ashoka]]'s preaching of Buddhism gathered together and said to each other, "Should this king Asoka continue a worshiper of Buddha, all other persons encouraged by him would likewise become followers of Buddha." They then went to people's houses and declared that their religion is the true religion and that Buddhism gives no Moksha.&lt;ref&gt;P. 245 ''Buddha'' by Manmatha Nath Dutt&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirthika is associated with the word [[Tirthankara]]&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, Asko, 2003. Sacred bathing place and transcendence: Dravidian kaTa(vuL) as the source of Indo-Aryan ghâT, tîrtha, tîrthankara and (tri)vikrama.

{{Certainty}}

[[File:Blank Fork.png|thumb|Situations often arise wherein a decision must be made when the results of each possible choice are uncertain.]]
'''Uncertainty''' is a situation which involves imperfect or unknown [[information]]. It applies to predictions of future events, to physical measurements that are already made, or to the unknown. Uncertainty arises in [[partially observable]] and/or [[stochastic]] environments, as well as due to [[ignorance]], [[Laziness|indolence]], or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Peter Norvig]] |author2=[[Sebastian Thrun]] |work=[[Udacity]] |url=https://www.udacity.com/wiki/cs271/unit1_notes |title=Introduction to Artificial Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arises in any number of fields, including [[insurance]], [[philosophy]], [[physics]], [[statistics]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[engineering]], [[metrology]], [[meteorology]], [[ecology]] and [[information science]].

==Concepts==
{{section too long|date=November 2017}}
Although the terms are used in various ways among the general public, many specialists in [[decision theory]], [[statistics]] and other quantitative fields have defined uncertainty, risk, and their measurement as:
;Uncertainty: The lack of [[certainty]], a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state, a future outcome, or more than one possible outcome.{{cn|date=November 2017}}
;Measurement of uncertainty: A set of possible states or outcomes where [[probabilities]] are assigned to each possible state or outcome – this also includes the application of a [[probability density function]] to continuous variables.&lt;ref&gt; Kabir, H. D., Khosravi, A., Hosen, M. A., &amp; Nahavandi, S. (2018). Neural Network-based Uncertainty Quantification: A Survey of Methodologies and Applications. IEEE Access. Vol. 6, Pages 36218 - 36234, DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2836917 &lt;/ref&gt; 
;Second order uncertainty: In statistics and economics, second-order uncertainty is represented in probability density functions over (first-order) probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gärdenfors |first1=Peter |last2=Sahlin |first2=Nils-Eric |year=1982 |title=Unreliable probabilities, risk taking, and decision making |journal=Synthese |issue=3 |volume=53 |pages=361–386 |doi=10.1007/BF00486156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Sundgren and Alexander Karlsson.

;Knightian uncertainty: In economics, in 1921 [[Frank Knight]] distinguished uncertainty from risk with uncertainty being lack of knowledge which is immeasurable and impossible to calculate; this is now referred to as [[Knightian uncertainty]]:
{{quote|Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of risk, from which it has never been properly separated.... The essential fact is that 'risk' means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really present and operating.... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or 'risk' proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all.|author=[[Frank Knight]] (1885–1972)|source=''Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit'' (1921), [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=F.

 |quote=There are some things that you know to be true, and others that you know to be false; yet, despite this extensive knowledge that you have, there remain many things whose truth or falsity is not known to you. We say that you are uncertain about them. You are uncertain, to varying degrees, about everything in the future; much of the past is hidden from you; and there is a lot of the present about which you do not have full information.

For example, if it is unknown whether or not it will rain tomorrow, then there is a state of uncertainty. If probabilities are applied to the possible outcomes using weather forecasts or even just a [[calibrated probability assessment]], the uncertainty has been quantified. Suppose it is quantified as a 90% chance of sunshine. If there is a major, costly, outdoor event planned for tomorrow then there is a risk since there is a 10% chance of rain, and rain would be undesirable. Furthermore, if this is a business event and $100,000 would be lost if it rains, then the risk has been quantified (a 10% chance of losing $100,000). These situations can be made even more realistic by quantifying light rain vs. heavy rain, the cost of delays vs. outright cancellation, etc.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Some may represent the risk in this example as the "expected opportunity loss" (EOL) or the chance of the loss multiplied by the amount of the loss (10% × $100,000 = $10,000). That is useful if the organizer of the event is "risk neutral", which most people are not. Most would be willing to pay a premium to avoid the loss. An insurance company, for example, would compute an EOL as a minimum for any insurance coverage, then add onto that other operating costs and profit. Since many people are willing to buy insurance for many reasons, then clearly the EOL alone is not the perceived value of avoiding the risk.

Quantitative uses of the terms uncertainty and risk are fairly consistent from fields such as [[probability theory]], [[actuarial science]], and [[information theory]]. Some also create new terms without substantially changing the definitions of uncertainty or risk. For example, [[surprisal]] is a variation on uncertainty sometimes used in [[information theory]]. But outside of the more mathematical uses of the term, usage may vary widely. In [[cognitive psychology]], uncertainty can be real, or just a matter of perception, such as [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectations]], threats, etc.

[[Vagueness]] is a form of uncertainty where the analyst is unable to clearly differentiate between two different classes, such as 'person of average height.' and 'tall person'. This form of vagueness can be modelled by some variation on [[Lotfi A. Zadeh|Zadeh]]'s [[fuzzy logic]] or [[subjective logic]]. 

[[Ambiguity]] is a form of uncertainty where even the possible outcomes have unclear meanings and interpretations. The statement &lt;i&gt;"He returns from the bank"&lt;/i&gt; is ambiguous because its interpretation depends on whether the word 'bank' is meant as &lt;i&gt;"the side of a river"&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;"a financial institution"&lt;/i&gt;. Ambiguity typically arises in situations where multiple analysts or observers have different interpretations of the same statements.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Uncertainty may be a consequence of a lack of knowledge of obtainable facts. That is, there may be uncertainty about whether a new rocket design will work, but this uncertainty can be removed with further analysis and experimentation. 

At the subatomic level, uncertainty may be a fundamental and unavoidable property of the universe. In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] puts limits on how much an observer can ever know about the position and velocity of a particle. This may not just be ignorance of potentially obtainable facts but that there is no fact to be found. There is some controversy in physics as to whether such uncertainty is an irreducible property of nature or if there are "hidden variables" that would describe the state of a particle even more exactly than Heisenberg's uncertainty principle allows.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Measurements== &lt;!-- Heavily linked section: Standard uncertainty, Concise notation --&gt;
{{Main article|Measurement uncertainty}}
{{See also|Uncertainty quantification|Uncertainty propagation}}

The most commonly used procedure for calculating measurement uncertainty is described in the "Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement" (GUM) published by [[ISO]]. A derived work is for example the [[National Institute for Standards and Technology]] (NIST) Technical Note 1297, "Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results", and the Eurachem/Citac publication "Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement". The uncertainty of the result of a measurement generally consists of several components. The components are regarded as [[random variables]], and may be grouped into two categories according to the method used to estimate their numerical values:
* Type A, those evaluated by [[statistical]] methods
* Type B, those evaluated by other means, e.g., by assigning a [[probability distribution]]
By propagating the [[variance]]s of the components through a function relating the components to the measurement result, the combined measurement uncertainty is given as the square root of the resulting variance. The simplest form is the [[standard deviation]] of a repeated observation.

In [[metereology]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]], the uncertainty or [[margin of error]] of a measurement, when explicitly stated, is given by a range of values likely to enclose the true value. This may be denoted by [[error bar]]s on a graph, or by the following notations:{{cn|date=November 2017}}
* ''measured value'' ± ''uncertainty''
* ''measured value'' {{su|p=+uncertainty|b=−uncertainty}}
* ''measured value'' (''uncertainty'')

{{Anchor|Shortest help for uncertainty notation}} 
In the last notation, parentheses are the concise notation for the ± notation. For example, applying 10 {{frac|1|2}} meters in a scientific or engineering application, it could be written {{val|10.5|u=m}} or {{val|10.50|u=m}}, by convention meaning accurate to ''within'' one tenth of a meter, or one hundredth. The precision is symmetric around the last digit. In this case it's half a tenth up and half a tenth down, so 10.5 means between 10.45 and 10.55. Thus it is ''understood'' that 10.5 means {{val|10.5|.05}}, and 10.50 means {{val|10.50|.005}}, also written {{val|10.50|(5)}} and {{val|10.500|(5)}} respectively.  But if the accuracy is within two tenths, the uncertainty is ± one tenth, and it is ''required'' to be explicit: {{val|10.5|.1}} and {{val|10.50|.01}} or {{val|10.5|(1)}} and {{val|10.50|(1)}}.   The numbers in parentheses ''apply'' to the numeral left of themselves, and are not part of that number, but part of a notation of uncertainty. They apply to the [[significant figure|least significant digits]]. For instance, {{val|1.00794|(7)}} stands for {{val|1.00794|0.00007}}, while {{val|1.00794|(72)}} stands for {{val|1.00794|0.00072}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html|title=Standard Uncertainty and Relative Standard Uncertainty|work=[[CODATA]] reference|publisher=[[NIST]]|accessdate=26 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016021440/http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html|archivedate=16 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concise notation is used for example by [[IUPAC]] in stating the [[list of elements by atomic mass|atomic mass]] of [[chemical element|elements]].

The middle notation is used when the error is not symmetrical about the value – for example {{val|3.4|+0.3|-0.2}}. This can occur when using a logarithmic scale, for example.

Uncertainty of a measurement can be determined by repeating a measurement to arrive at an estimate of the standard deviation of the values. Then, any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation. However, if the values are averaged, then the mean measurement value has a much smaller uncertainty, equal to the [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements. This procedure neglects [[systematic error]]s, however.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

When the uncertainty represents the standard error of the measurement, then about 68.3% of the time, the true value of the measured quantity falls within the stated uncertainty range. For example, it is likely that for 31.7% of the atomic mass values given on the [[list of elements by atomic mass]], the true value lies outside of the stated range. If the width of the interval is doubled, then probably only 4.6% of the true values lie outside the doubled interval, and if the width is tripled, probably only 0.3% lie outside. These values follow from the properties of the [[normal distribution]], and they apply only if the measurement process produces normally distributed errors. In that case, the quoted [[standard error (statistics)|standard errors]] are easily converted to 68.3% ("one [[sigma]]"), 95.4% ("two sigma"), or 99.7% ("three sigma") [[confidence interval]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In this context, uncertainty depends on both the [[accuracy and precision]] of the measurement instrument. The lower the accuracy and precision of an instrument, the larger the measurement uncertainty is. Notice that precision is often determined as the standard deviation of the repeated measures of a given value, namely using the same method described above to assess measurement uncertainty. However, this method is correct only when the instrument is accurate. When it is inaccurate, the uncertainty is larger than the standard deviation of the repeated measures, and it appears evident that the uncertainty does not depend only on instrumental precision.

==Uncertainty and the media==
Uncertainty in science, and science in general, may be interpreted differently in the public sphere than in the scientific community.&lt;ref name=zehr&gt;Zehr, S. C. (1999). Scientists' representation of uncertainty. In Friedman, S.M., Dunwoody, S., &amp; Rogers, C. L. (Eds.), Communicating uncertainty: Media coverage of new and controversial science (3–21). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due in part to the diversity of the public audience, and the tendency for scientists to misunderstand lay audiences and therefore not communicate ideas clearly and effectively.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; One example is explained by the [[information deficit model]]. Also, in the public realm, there are often many scientific voices giving input on a single topic.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; For example, depending on how an issue is reported in the public sphere, discrepancies between outcomes of multiple scientific studies due to methodological differences could be interpreted by the public as a lack of consensus in a situation where a consensus does in fact exist.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; This interpretation may have even been intentionally promoted, as scientific uncertainty may be managed to reach certain goals.  For example, global warming contrarian activists took the advice of [[Frank Luntz]] to frame [[global warming]] as an issue of scientific uncertainty, which was a precursor to the conflict frame used by journalists when reporting the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbet |first=M. |last2=Scheufele |first2=D. A. |year=2009 |title=What's next for science communication? Promising directions and lingering distractions |journal=[[American Journal of Botany]] |volume=96 |issue=10 |pages=1767–1778 |doi=10.3732/ajb.0900041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Indeterminacy can be loosely said to apply to situations in which not all the parameters of the system and their interactions are fully known, whereas ignorance refers to situations in which it is not known what is not known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shackley |first=S. |last2=Wynne |first2=B. |year=1996 |title=Representing uncertainty in global climate change science and policy: Boundary-ordering devices and authority |journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=275–302 |doi=10.1177/016224399602100302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These unknowns, indeterminacy and ignorance, that exist in science are often "transformed" into uncertainty when reported to the public in order to make issues more manageable, since scientific indeterminacy and ignorance are difficult concepts for scientists to convey without losing credibility.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; Conversely, uncertainty is often interpreted by the public as ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Somerville |first=R. C. |last2=Hassol |first2=S. J. |year=2011 |title=Communicating the science of climate change |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume= 64|issue= |pages=48–53 | doi = 10.1063/pt.3.1296 |bibcode=2011PhT....64j..48S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation of indeterminacy and ignorance into uncertainty may be related to the public's misinterpretation of uncertainty as ignorance.

Journalists may inflate uncertainty (making the science seem more uncertain than it really is) or downplay uncertainty (making the science seem more certain than it really is).&lt;ref name=stocking&gt;{{cite book |last=Stocking |first=H. |year=1999 |chapter=How journalists deal with scientific uncertainty |editor1-last=Friedman |editor1-first=S. M. |editor2-last=Dunwoody |editor2-first=S. |editor3-last=Rogers |editor3-first=C. L. |title=Communicating Uncertainty: Media Coverage of New and Controversial Science |pages=23–41 |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |isbn=0-8058-2727-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way that journalists inflate uncertainty is by describing new research that contradicts past research without providing context for the change.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; Journalists may give scientists with minority views equal weight as scientists with majority views, without adequately describing or explaining the state of [[scientific consensus]] on the issue.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; In the same vein, journalists may give non-scientists the same amount of attention and importance as scientists.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt;

Journalists may downplay uncertainty by eliminating "scientists' carefully chosen tentative wording, and by losing these caveats the information is skewed and presented as more certain and conclusive than it really is".&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; Also, stories with a single source or without any context of previous research mean that the subject at hand is presented as more definitive and certain than it is in reality.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; There is often a "product over process" approach to [[science journalism]] that aids, too, in the downplaying of uncertainty.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; Finally, and most notably for this investigation, when science is framed by journalists as a triumphant quest, uncertainty is erroneously framed as "reducible and resolvable".&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt;

Some media routines and organizational factors affect the overstatement of uncertainty; other media routines and organizational factors help inflate the certainty of an issue. Because the general public (in the United States) generally trusts scientists, when science stories are covered without alarm-raising cues from special interest organizations (religious groups, environmental organizations, political factions, etc.) they are often covered in a business related sense, in an economic-development frame or a social progress frame.&lt;ref name=nisbet&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbet |first=M. |last2=Scheufele |first2=D. A. |year=2007 |title=The Future of Public Engagement |journal=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=38–44 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of these frames is to downplay or eliminate uncertainty, so when economic and scientific promise are focused on early in the issue cycle, as has happened with coverage of plant biotechnology and nanotechnology in the United States, the matter in question seems more definitive and certain.&lt;ref name=nisbet /&gt;

Sometimes, stockholders, owners, or advertising will pressure a media organization to promote the business aspects of a scientific issue, and therefore any uncertainty claims which may compromise the business interests are downplayed or eliminated.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt;

==Applications==
* Uncertainty is designed into [[game]]s, most notably in [[gambling]], where [[probability|chance]] is central to play.
* In [[scientific modelling]], in which the prediction of future events should be understood to have a range of expected values
* In [[optimization]], uncertainty permits one to describe situations where the user does not have full control on the final outcome of the optimization procedure, see [[scenario optimization]] and [[stochastic optimization]]. 
** In [[meteorology|weather forecasting]], it is now commonplace to include data on the degree of uncertainty in a [[weather forecast]].
* Uncertainty or [[error]] is used in science and engineering notation. Numerical values should only be expressed to those digits that are physically meaningful, which are referred to as [[significant figures]]. Uncertainty is involved in every measurement, such as measuring a distance, a temperature, etc., the degree depending upon the instrument or technique used to make the measurement. Similarly, uncertainty is propagated through calculations so that the calculated value has some degree of uncertainty depending upon the uncertainties of the measured values and the equation used in the calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=Kent J. |last2=Bibbo |first2=Giovanni |last3=Pattison |first3=John E. |year=2005 |title=A Standard Approach to Measurement Uncertainties for Scientists and Engineers in Medicine |journal=Australasian Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=131–139 |doi=10.1007/BF03178705 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[physics]], the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] forms the basis of modern [[quantum mechanics]].
* In [[metrology]], [[measurement uncertainty]] is a central concept quantifying the dispersion one may reasonably attribute to a measurement result. Such an uncertainty can also be referred to as a measurement [[error]]. In daily life, measurement uncertainty is often implicit ("He is 6 feet tall" give or take a few inches), while for any serious use an explicit statement of the measurement uncertainty is necessary. The expected measurement uncertainty of many [[measuring instruments]] (scales, oscilloscopes, force gages, rulers, thermometers, etc.) is often stated in the manufacturers' specifications.
* In [[engineering]], uncertainty can be used in the context of validation and verification of material modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Category:Uncertainty |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926183351/https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Category:Uncertainty |archivedate=2015-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uncertainty has been a common theme in art, both as a thematic device (see, for example, the indecision of [[Hamlet]]), and as a quandary for the artist (such as [[Martin Creed]]'s difficulty with deciding what artworks to make).
* Uncertainty is an important factor in [[economics]]. According to economist [[Frank Knight]], it is different from [[risk]], where there is a specific [[probability]] assigned to each outcome (as when flipping a fair coin). Knightian uncertainty involves a situation that has unknown probabilities.
** Investing in [[financial market]]s such as the stock market involves Knightian uncertainty when the probabiliy of a rare but catastrophic event is unknown.
** In [[entrepreneurship]]: New products, services, firms and even markets may be created in the absence of probability estimates. According to entrepreneurship research, expert entrepreneurs use{{since when|date=November 2017}} experience based [[heuristics]] called [[effectuation]] (as opposed to [[causality]]) to overcome uncertainty.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Name==
The term "buffalo" is sometimes considered to be a [[misnomer]] for this animal, as it is only distantly related to either of the two "true buffalo", the Asian [[water buffalo]] and the [[African buffalo]]. However, "[[bison]]" is a Greek word meaning [[ox]]-like animal, while "buffalo" originated with the French fur trappers who called these massive beasts {{lang|fr|bœufs}}, meaning ox or bullock—so both names, "bison" and "buffalo", have a similar meaning. Though the name "bison" might be considered to be more scientifically correct, as a result of standard usage the name "buffalo" is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison.  In reference to this animal, the term "buffalo" dates to 1635 in North American usage when the term was first recorded for the American mammal.  It thus has a much longer history than the term "bison", which was first recorded in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition&lt;/ref&gt; The American bison is very closely related to the wisent or [[European bison]].

==Morphology==
[[File:Buffalo in the Rain.JPG|thumb|left|Bull at [[North Carolina Zoo]]]]
In comparison to [[plains bison]] (the other surviving [[North America]]n subspecies/ecotype), wood bison is larger and heavier, with large males reaching {{convert|3.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long without {{convert|54|cm|ft|abbr=on}} tails and {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall at [[withers]] and {{convert|1179|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}} in weight, making it morphologically more similar to at least one of chronological subspecies of ancestral [[steppe bison]]s (''Bison priscus'' sp.)&lt;ref&gt;Gennady G.

The highest point of the wood bison is well ahead of its front legs, while the plains bison's highest point is directly above the front legs. Wood bison also have larger horn cores, darker and woollier pelages, and less hair on their forelegs and beards.&lt;ref name=RFLP/&gt;

On the other hand, plains bisons are capable of running faster and longer than bisons living in the forests and mountains.&lt;ref name=WWFRussia&gt;Semenov U.A. of [[WWF]]-Russia, 2014, "The Wisents of Karachay-Cherkessia", Proceedings of the [[Sochi National Park]] (8), pp.11, {{ISBN|978-5-87317-984-8}}, KMK Scientific Press&lt;/ref&gt;


==Conservation==
In addition to the loss of habitat and hunting, wood bison populations have also been in danger of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] with plains bison, therefore [[genetic pollution|polluting]] the genetic stock.

As with other bison, the wood bison's population was devastated by hunting and other factors. By the early 1900s, they were regarded as extremely rare or perhaps nearly extinct. However, a herd of about 200 was discovered in [[Alberta]], Canada, in 1957. This herd has since recovered to a total population around 2500, largely as a result of conservation efforts by Canadian government agencies. In 1988, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada &lt;!-- (COSEWIC) --&gt; changed the subspecies' conservation status from "endangered" to "[[Threatened species|threatened]]," where it remains.&lt;ref name=sara&gt;[http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=143 Species At Risk Registry: Wood Bison]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2008, 53 Canadian wood bison were transferred from [[Elk Island National Park]] in Alberta, Canada, to the [[Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center]] near [[Anchorage, Alaska]].&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/080709/0414211.html Canada Helps Restore Wood Bison to Alaska in International Conservation Effort to Recover a Threatened Species], Yahoo! Finance, July 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; There they were to be held in [[quarantine]] for two years, and then reintroduced to their native habitat in the Minto Flats area near [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], but this plan was still on hold&lt;ref name=adn&gt;[http://newsminer.com/bookmark/15090989-Release-of-bison-into-Alaska-wilderness-put-on-hold-again- Release of bison into Alaska wilderness put on hold again], Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, Aug 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskawildlife.org/animals/wood-bison/|title=Wood Bison - AWCC|website=www.alaskawildlife.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; until April 7, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/video/video-wood-bison-released-southwest-alaska Video], Alaska Dispatch News&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final rule allowing the reintroduction of a "non-essential experimental" population of wood bison into three areas of Alaska. The new regulation took effect June 6. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game introduced the first herd of 100 animals to the Innoko River area in western Alaska in spring 2015.

Currently, about 7000 wood bison remain in the wild, located in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta, and [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref name=adfg2&gt;[http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/_live/pages/wpPages/wood_bison.aspx Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources - Northwest Territories], Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources - Northwest Territories&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bisoncentre.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=135 |title= Wood Bison Recovery: Restoring Grazing Systems in Canada, Alaska and Eastern Siberia|author= Gates, Zimov, Stephenson, Chapin |work= |publisher= |accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diseases==
Publicly owned free-ranging herds in Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories comprise 90% of existing wood bison, although six smaller public and private captive-breeding herds with conservation objectives comprise roughly 10% of the total (''n'' ≈ 900). These captive herds and two large isolated free-ranging herds in the Yukon and Northwest Territories all derive from disease-free and morphologically representative founding stock from northern [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in northeastern Alberta and southern Northwest Territories. These captive herds are particularly important for conservation and recovery purposes, because the larger free-ranging herds in and around Wood Buffalo National Park were infected with bovine [[brucellosis]] and [[tuberculosis]] after 7,000 [[plains bison]] &lt;!-- (''Bison bison bison'') --&gt; were trans-shipped by barge from [[Buffalo National Park]] near [[Wainwright, Alberta]], in the 1920s.

Diseases including [[brucellosis]] and [[tuberculosis]] remain [[endemism|endemic]] in the free-ranging herds in and around Wood Buffalo National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Joly | first = D. O. | authorlink = |author2=Messier, F.  | title = Factors affecting apparent prevalence of tuberculosis and brucellosis nubs are amazing| journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 623–631 | publisher =  | location = | date = 2004-06-16 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118754826/HTMLSTART | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00836.x | accessdate = 2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diseases represent a serious management issue for governments, various local [[aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal groups]], and the [[cattle]] industry rapidly encroaching on the park's boundaries. Disease management strategies and initiatives began in the 1950s, and have yet to result in a reduction of the incidence of either disease despite considerable expenditure and increased public involvement.
