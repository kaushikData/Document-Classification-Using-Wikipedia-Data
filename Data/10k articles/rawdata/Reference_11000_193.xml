      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3810">'''''Academic American Encyclopedia''''' is a 21-volume general [[English language|English-language]] [[encyclopedia]] published in 1980. It was first produced by [[Arête |Arête Publishing]], the American subsidiary of the Dutch publishing company [[Nielsen Company|VNU]]&lt;ref name="Kister"&gt;''[[Kenneth Kister|Kister]]'s Best Encyclopedias'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; (later acquired by [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Media Research]] in 1999).

[[Grolier]] acquired the encyclopedia in 1982. It has also been published under the names ''Grolier Academic Encyclopedia'', ''Grolier International Encyclopedia'', ''Lexicon Universal Encyclopedia'', ''Macmillan Family Encyclopedia'', ''[[Barnes &amp; Noble]] New American Encyclopedia'', and ''Global International Encyclopedia''.&lt;ref name="Kister" /&gt;

An abridged version was known as the ''Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge''.&lt;ref name="Kister" /&gt;

The full text of the encyclopedia was available to 200 homes in [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1980, as part of an experiment sponsored by [[OCLC]]. A year later, the text was available to subscribers of ''[[The New York Times]]'' Information Bank, the [[Dow Jones News/Retrieval]] and [[CompuServe]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Arête Publishing's interactive version, including illustrations, video and audio stored on [[videodisc|videodisk]] was shown at the [[Frankfurt]] [[Frankfurt Book Fair|Book Fair]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mi1hy_DYW_kC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=arete+%22american+academic+encyclopedia%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3VF3Hk9fjr&amp;sig=JAWVf795yvXDAQIf2i-Hk-5Qd-M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result ''Information Technology and Its Impact on American Education'', Washington, D.C: Congress of the U.S., Office of Technology Assessment, 1982.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grolier]] published the text-only 1985 [[CD-ROM]] ''The Electronic Encyclopedia from Grolier'', based on the ''Academic American Encyclopedia'', which comprised 30,000 entries and 9 million words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=CD ROM Conference: Lured by 600 Megabytes on Disk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmtbry-ytXgC&amp;pg=PA42 |access-date=2016-11-19 |author-first=Craig L. |author-last=Stark |journal=[[PC Magazine]] |date=1986-04-29 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans_2004"&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Harold |author-last1=Evans |author-link1=Harold Evans |author-first2=Gail |author-last2=Buckland |author-first3=David |author-last3=Lefer |author-link3=David Lefer |year=2004 |title=They Made America: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine: Two Centuries of Innovators |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Co.]] |isbn=978-0-316-27766-2 |id={{ISBN|0-316-27766-5}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, when it was called ''The New Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia'' (1988–1991), still pictures were added.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/28/science/personal-computers-cd-rom-for-the-common-man.html Lewis, Peter H. "PERSONAL COMPUTERS; CD-ROM for the Common Man," ''The New York Times'', November 28, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt; This evolved into the 1992 ''The New Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia'', later named the ''[[Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name="Kister" /&gt;

The [[CD-ROM]] version features a search function and offers the complete text of the ''Academic American Encyclopedia'', including [[illustration]]s, [[photograph]]s, [[animation|animated]] [[map]]s, [[music]] and [[video]]s.

==Historic==
===Ancient Rome===
In the mid-[[Roman Republic|Republican period Rome]] phil-Hellenic and anti-Hellenic Roman intellectuals were involved in a conflict over Greek influence. One author explains, "the relationship of Romans to Greek culture was frequently ambiguous: they admired it as superior and adopted its criteria, while they remained skeptical of some aspects; hence they adapted it selectively according to their own purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manuwald|first1=Gesine|title=Roman Republican Theatre|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521110167|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anti-Hellenic movement emerged in reaction to the primacy of Greek led by the conservative and reactionary statesman [[Cato the Elder]] (234-149 BCE), who was the first to write a Roman history in Latin, and was prominent for his anti-Hellenic views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rochette|first=Buno|editor-last=Bakker|editor-first=Egbert J.|title=A Companion to the Ancient Greek Language|contribution=Greek and Latin Bilingualism|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=9781444317404|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Geoff W.|title=The Roman Emperor Gaius "Caligula" and His Hellenistic Aspirations|date=2007|publisher=BrownWalker Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9781599424231|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw Hellenism a threat to Roman culture, but did not find wide support, especially in the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bunson|first1=Matthew|authorlink1=Matthew Bunson|title=[[Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire]]|contribution=Hellenism|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438110271|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Erich S. Gruen]] argued that Cato's "anti-Greek 'pronouncements' reflect deliberate posturing and do not represent 'the core of Catonian though'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrichs|first1=Albert|title=Graecia Capta: Roman Views of Greek Culture|journal=[[Harvard Studies in Classical Philology]]|date=1995|volume=97|page=247|jstor=311309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prominent philosopher and politician [[Cicero]] (106–43 BCE) was "highly ambivalent" about Greeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaac|first=Benjamin|authorlink1=Benjamin Isaac|title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691125985|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practiced "anti-Greek slur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schott|first=Jeremy M.|title=Christianity, Empire, and the Making of Religion in Late Antiquity|date=2008|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0346-2|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first-second century poet [[Juvenal]] was another major anti-Hellenic figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Braund|editor1-first=Susanna|editor2-last=Osgood|editor2-first=Josiah|title=A Companion to Persius and Juvenal|date=2012|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1405199650|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Green (historian)|title=Alexander to Actium: The Hellenistic Age|date=1993|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=9780500277287|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin West===
Following the [[East–West Schism]] of 1054, anti-Greek sentiment became widespread in the [[Greek East and Latin West|Latin West]] (dominated by the [[Catholic Church]]). It reached its climax during the [[Fourth Crusade]] and the 1204 [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]], the Byzantine capital, and the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowe|first1=John Gordon|title=The Papacy and the Greeks (1122–1153)|journal=[[Church History (journal)|Church History: Studies in Christianity and Culture]]|date=1959|volume=28|issue=2|page=120|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/church-history/article/papacy-and-the-greeks-11221153/7BB57225F84DBAC97B8A2D4EA07C9295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern==
===Albania===
In the [[Interwar period]] (1918–39), the Albanian government closed down Greek schools as part of its policies of assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albania &gt; Greeks |url=http://www.minorityrights.org/1400/albania/greeks.html |publisher=[[Minority Rights Group International]] |accessdate=15 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115070035/http://www.minorityrights.org/1400/albania/greeks.html |archivedate=November 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist rule in Albania]] (1944–92), the government restricted the use of Greek language and Greek names by the [[Greeks in Albania|country's Greek minority]] in an attempt of forced assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levinson|first1=David|title=Ethnic Groups Worldwide: A Ready Reference Handbook|date=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9781573560191|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Greek sentiment dominated the thinking of [[Enver Hoxha]], the communist leader of Albania, during the [[Greek Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xhudo|first1=Gus|title=Tension among neighbors: Greek‐Albanian relations and their impact on regional security and stability|journal=Studies in Conflict and Terrorism|date=1995|volume=18|issue=2|p=120|doi=10.1080/10576109508435972|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10576109508435972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-Communist Albania, "there are no significant explicitly racist or chauvinist political parties", although, according to [[James Pettifer]], "there are many individual politicians who adhere to very strong anti-Greek views, which in turn affects the orientation of virtually all ethnic Albanian political parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pettifer|first1=James|authorlink1=James Pettifer|contribution=The Greek Minority in Albania: Ethnic Politics in Pre-National State|editor1-last=Stein|editor1-first=Jonathan P.|title=The Politics of National Minority Participation in Post-Communist Europe|date=2000|publisher=[[M. E. Sharpe]]|isbn=0-7656-0528-7|page=184|url=http://www.professorjamespettifer.com/uploads/files/pdf/The%20polotics%20of%20national%20minority%20participation.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112030244/http://www.professorjamespettifer.com/uploads/files/pdf/The%20polotics%20of%20national%20minority%20participation.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 poll in Albania, Greece topped the list of countries perceived to be a threat to Albania (18.5%), although the plurality of respondents (46.4%) agreed with the statement "No country is a threat to Albania".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cela |first1=Alba |last2=Lleshaj |first2=Sashenka |title=Albanian-Greek elations from the eyes of the Albanian public perceptions 2013 |url=http://www.fes-tirana.org/media/publications/pdf-files/2014/p-140401-albanian-greek-eng.pdf |website=[[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] |publisher=Albanian Institute for International Studies |location=Tirana |date=March 2014 |p=31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115063524/http://www.fes-tirana.org/media/publications/pdf-files/2014/p-140401-albanian-greek-eng.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[Greeks in Australia]] have been subject to discrimination. During World War I, due to King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]]'s pro-German sympathies, Greek immigrants were viewed with hostility and suspicion. Anti-Greek riots occurred in [[Perth]] in 1915 and in [[Kalgoorlie]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vassilopoulos|first1=James|title=Greek Australians: beyond the stereotypes|journal=[[Green Left Weekly]]|date=24 March 1999|url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/19942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yiannakis|first1=John N.|title=Kalgoorlie alchemy: xenophobia, patriotism and the 1916 anti-Greek riots|journal=[[Early Days (journal)|Early Days]]|date=1996|volume=11|issue=2|pages=199–211|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=980808282;res=IELAPA|publisher=[[Royal Western Australian Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "[[wog]]" is an ethnic slur used in Australia to refer to [[Southern Europe]]an and [[Middle East]]ern people of the [[Mediterranean region]], including Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aren’t you sick of being called a WOG?|url=http://au.greekreporter.com/2013/02/04/arent-you-sick-of-being-called-a-wog/|agency=[[Greek Reporter]]|date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wog|url=http://www.rsdb.org/slur/wog|website=rsdb.org|publisher=Racial Slur Database|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been adopted and used by Greek Australians to refer to themselves, including through the sitcom ''[[Acropolis Now]]'' (1989–92), the television spin-off of the 1987 play ''[[Wogs Out of Work]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wagg|editor1-first=Stephen|title=Because I Tell a Joke or Two: Comedy, Politics and Social Difference|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134794324|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2000 film ''[[The Wog Boy]]''.

===Bulgaria===
In 1906, during the [[Macedonian Struggle]], anti-Greek rallies and violent attacks took place in a number of Bulgarian cities. In [[Plovdiv]], Greek Orthodox churches and schools, Greek-owned properties were looted and plundered. In [[Pomorie]] (Anchialos) the Greek population was expelled after the city was set up on fire and up to 110 Greeks were killed. Pogroms also took place in [[Varna]], [[Burgas]] and other locations.&lt;ref&gt;Kotzabassi Maria, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20141115022236/http://kassiani.fhw.gr/blacksea/Forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=11520&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State= Persecution of Greek populations at the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea, 1906]", ''Encyclopaedia of the Hellenic World, Black Sea''&lt;/ref&gt; Following the pogroms, around 20,000 Greeks fled Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dragostinova|first=Theodora|title=Speaking National: Nationalizing the Greeks of Bulgaria, 1900-1939|journal=[[Slavic Review]]|date=2008|volume=67|issue=1|page=160|jstor=27652772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
On August 2–5, 1918, a [[1918 Toronto anti-Greek riot|three-day anti-Greek riot occurred in Toronto]]. "Mobs of up to 5,000 people, led by war veterans [[World War I|returned from Europe]], marched through the city's main streets waging pitched battles with law enforcement officers and destroying every Greek business they came across." The consequence was damages of $100,000 to Greek businesses and private property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=Thomas W.

The [[Macedonia naming dispute]] since the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] has given rise to anti-Greek sentiment in the [[Republic of Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karakatsanis|first1=Leonidas|title=Turkish-Greek Relations: Rapprochement, Civil Society and the Politics of Friendship|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317906230|page=79|quote=After persisting unresolved for ten years the 'name issue' has also been reflected in the growth of a mirroring nationalist anti-Greek movement in the Republic of Macedonia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one author, there was "considerable popular anti-Greek feeling in Macedonia" as of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=John|title=Macedonia: Warlords and Rebels in the Balkans|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=9780300102680|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, German diplomat Geert-Hinrich Ahrens ([[:de:Geert-Hinrich Ahrens|ger]]) wrote in 2007 that he "had never detected any anti-Greek manifestations" in the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahrens|first1=Geert-Hinrich|title=Diplomacy on the Edge: Containment of Ethnic Conflict and the Minorities Working Group of the Conferences on Yugoslavia|date=2007|publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Woodrow Wilson Center Press]]|isbn=978-0-8018-8557-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b3fLRcHYSVAC&amp;pg=PA385&amp;dq=i+had+never+detected+any+anti-greek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AURAVM6XDsK1sQSFkICADA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=i%20had%20never%20detected%20any%20anti-greek&amp;f=false 385]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main opposition party of the Republic of Macedonia, [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity]] (VMRO-DPMNE), founded in 1990, includes the name of [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]], a revolutionary movement active in the early 20th century, which is regarded by Greeks "a notorious anti-Greek terrorist organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danforth|first1=Loring M.|authorlink1=Loring Danforth|title=The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World|date=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691043562|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the party's First Congress, [[Ljubčo Georgievski]], first leader of the party, declared that "the next Congress will convene in Solun" ([[Thessaloniki]] in [[South Slavic languages]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Papavizas|first1=George Constantine|title=Claiming Macedonia: The Struggle for the Heritage, Territory and Name of the Historic Hellenic Land, 1862-2004|date=2006|publisher=Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc|isbn=0786423234|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Dimitar Bechev, a British-based international relations researcher, Macedonian Prime Minister [[Nikola Gruevski]] (the leader of VMRO-DPMNE) exploited "anti-Greek nationalism" during the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bechev|first1=Dimitar|title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia|date=2009|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=9780810862951|page=Ixxiii|quote=...Gruevski, riding the waves of anti-Greek nationalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Gruevski accused Greece of having waged "political genocide" against his country. Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Gregory Delavekouras responded that Gruevski's statements "stoke the systematic negative government propaganda that is aimed at turning public opinion in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia against Greece."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jakov Marusic|first1=Sinisa|title=Greece: Macedonia Waging 'Anti-Greek' Propaganda War|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/greece-macedonia-nurtures-anti-greek-propaganda|agency=[[Balkan Insight]]|publisher=BIRN|date=28 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
At its inception Romanian national historiography was heavily influenced by romanticism. This led to a reconsideration of the role played by the [[Phanariotes]] who ruled modern day Romania as emissaries of the Ottoman Empire. Romanian national poet [[Mihai Eminescu]] described Greeks as "the poison of the Orient, hypocritical people who crave to exploit others". The hellenophobic tendency in Romanian historiography was reversed through the work of historian [[Nicolae Iorga]].&lt;ref name=Romania/&gt;

During the course of the [[Macedonian Struggle]], Romania founded the [[Society of Macedono–Romanian Culture]] which conducted ethnographic expeditions to Macedonia, [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]]. The Society later took up the role of representing Romania interests in the region. The propagation of Romanian nationalist ideals among the [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] communities, created a rift between the two countries known as the [[Vlach Question]]. Another important issue was the status of the inheritances of [[Greeks in Romania]]. In 1892, Romania refused to hand over the property of the recently deceased Greek expatriate Konstantinos Zappas to the Greek state citing an article of the Romanian constitution forbidding foreign nationals from owning agricultural land. The Trikoupis government then recalled its ambassador in Bucharest, Romania followed suit thus severing diplomatic relations between the countries. Diplomatic relations were restored in July 1896, in response to a rise of Bulgarian [[komitadji]] activity in Macedonia. In 1905, the two countries exchanged accusations regarding the Vlach Question. Romania claimed that Greek armed bands targeted ethnic Romanians in Macedonia, whereas Greece accused Romania of trying to create a false equation between Aromanians and Romanians.&lt;ref name=Romania/&gt;

Hellenophobic articles began appearing in the Romanian press. On 2 August 1905, the Society of Macedono–Romanian Culture organized an anti–Greek protest in Bucharest, attended by army officers, student and Vlachs. After decrying Greek war crimes in Macedonia, the organizers called for a boycott of Greek products and services. Rioting was prevented by a large force of Romanian [[Gendarmerie (Romania)|gendarmerie]]. On the same day a Greek owned cafe in Bucharest was vandalized and its owner beaten. Several days later three editors of the Greek language newspaper Patris were expelled from the country for sedition. On 13 August, protesters burnt a Greek flag in [[Giurgiu]]. An official remonstrance by the Greek ambassador Tombazis was rebutted leading to a mutual withdrawal of embassies on 15 September. In November, the Romanian government allocated funding for the creation of armed Aromanian bands in Macedonia, a parallel motion closed numerous Greek schools in the country. In February 1906, six leading members of the Greek community were expelled from the country, citing their alleged funding of Greek bands in Macedonia. In July 1906, the Greek government officially severed diplomatic relations with Romania. In 1911, Greek prime minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] used the occasion of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] to improve relations with Bulgaria and Romania, restoring diplomatic relations with the latter.&lt;ref name=Romania&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Sfetas|first=Spyridon|date=2001|title=Το ιστορικό πλαίσιο των ελληνο-ρουμανικών πολιτικών σχέσεων (1866-1913)|trans-title=The Historical Context of Greco-Romanian political relations (1866-1913)|language=Greek|url=https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/makedonika/article/view/5839|journal=Makedonika|publisher=Society of Macedonian Studies|volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=23–48|doi=|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
Between 1919 and 1924 around 47,000 Greeks emigrated from Russia to Greece as a result of the official and unofficial anti-Greek sentiment in Russia, which in its turn was a result of the Greek intervention in the Black Sea region in the [[Russian Civil War]] against the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Olson|editor1-first=James S.|editor1-link=James S.

During and following World War I, almost all of the Greek population of Anatolia was either [[Greek genocide|exterminated by the Ottoman government]] or later transferred to Greece as part of a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]].

In the early 20th century [[Greeks in the United States]] were discriminated against in many ways. In 1904 Greek immigrants, unaware of labor conditions and largely inexperienced, served as [[strikebreaker]]s during a strike in Chicago diesel shops. This fueled anti-Greek sentiment among union members. Three Greek immigrants were killed during a riot in 1908 in [[McGill, Nevada]].&lt;ref name="LeMay"/&gt; On February 21, 1909 a major [[Greek Town Riot|anti-Greek riot]] took place in [[South Omaha, Nebraska]].

The '''''Book of Dede Korkut''''' or '''''Book of Korkut Ata''''' ({{lang-tr|Dede Korkut or Korkut Ata}}; {{lang-az|Dədə Qorqud}}, دده قورقود;  {{lang-tk|Gorkut Ata}}) is the most famous among the epic stories of the [[Oghuz Turks]]. The stories carry morals and values significant to the social lifestyle of the nomadic [[Turkic peoples]] and their [[Tengrism|pre-Islamic beliefs]]. The book's mythic narrative is part of the cultural heritage of [[Turkic countries]], including [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and to a lesser degree [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barthold|1962|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The epic tales of ''Dede Korkut'' are some of the best known Turkic [[dastan]]s from among a total of well over 1,000 recorded epics among the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolian]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language families.&lt;ref&gt;Rinchindorji. [http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/16ii/Rinchindorji.pdf "Mongolian-Turkic Epics: Typological Formation and Development"], Institute of Ethnic Literature, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Trans. by Naran Bilik, ''Oral Tradition'', 16/2, 2001, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and synopsis of the epic==
''Dede Korkut'' is a heroic [[dastan]] (legend), also known as ''Oghuz-nameh'' among the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz Turkic people]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050526183524/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/019/701.htm "Dastan". ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' (in 30 volumes), Third edition, Moscow, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; which starts out in [[Central Asia]], continues in Anatolia and [[Iran]], and centers most of its action in the Azerbaijani [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050525145131/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/061/550.htm ''Kitabi Dede Korkut''. ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' (in 30 volumes), Third edition, Moscow, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barthold, "it is not possible to surmise that this dastan could have been written anywhere but in the Caucasus".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barthold|1962|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Turkic peoples, especially people who identify themselves as Oghuz, it is the principal repository of ethnic identity, history, customs and the value systems of the Turkic peoples throughout history. It commemorates struggles for freedom at a time when the Oghuz Turks were a herding people, although "it is clear that the stories were put into their present form at a time when the Turks of Oghuz descent no longer thought of themselves as Oghuz."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1974|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-10th century on, the term 'Oghuz' was gradually supplanted among the Turks themselves by 'Turcoman' (Turkmen); this process was completed by the beginning of the 13th century. The Turcomans were those Turks, mostly but not exclusively Oghuz, who had embraced Islam and begun to lead a more sedentary life than their forefathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1974|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, a federation of Oghuz, or, as they were by this time termed, Turcoman tribesmen, who called themselves [[Aq Qoyunlu|Ak-koyunlu]] established a dynasty that ruled eastern Turkey, Azerbaijan, [[Iraq]] and western Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1974|p=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contents===
The twelve stories that comprise the bulk of the work were written down after the Turks converted to Islam, and the heroes are often portrayed as good Muslims while the villains are referred to as [[infidel]]s, but there are also many references to the Turks' pre-Islamic magic. The character Dede Korkut, i.e. "Grandfather Korkut", is a widely renowned soothsayer and bard, and serves to link the stories together, and the thirteenth chapter of the book compiles sayings attributed to him. "In the dastans, Dede Korkut appears as the ''aksakal'' [literally 'white-beard,' the respected elder], the advisor or sage, solving the difficulties faced by tribal members. ... Among the population, respected aksakals are wise and know how to solve problems; among ''ashiks'' [reciters of dastans] they are generally called ''dede'' [grandfather]. In the past, this term designated respected tribal elders, and now is used within families; in many localities of Azerbaijan, it replaces ''ata'' [ancestor or father]."&lt;ref name="aton.ttu.edu"&gt;[http://aton.ttu.edu/Introduction_to_DEDE_KORKUT.asp Prof. H.B.Paksoy (ed.), "Introduction to Dede Korkut"] (As Co-Editor), ''Soviet Anthropology and Archeology'', Vol. 29, No. 1. Summer 1990; and, "M. Dadashzade on the Ethnographic Information Concerning Azerbaijan Contained in the Dede Korkut dastan", ''Soviet Anthropology and Archeology'', Vol. 29, No. 1. Summer 1990. Reprinted in H. B. Paksoy (Ed.), ''Central Asia Reader: The Rediscovery of History'' (New York/London: M. E. Sharpe, 1994), {{ISBN|1-56324-201-X}} (Hardcover); {{ISBN|1-56324-202-8}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (d. 1318) says that Dede Korkut was a real person and lived for 295 years; that he appeared in the time of the Oghuz ruler Inal Syr Yavkuy Khan, by whom he was sent as ambassador to the [[Prophet]]; that he became [[Muslim]]; that he gave advice to the Great Khan of the Oghuz, attended the election of the Great Khan, and gave names to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1974|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tales tell of warriors and battles and are likely grounded in the conflicts between the Oghuz and the [[Pechenegs]] and [[Kipchaks]]. Many story elements are familiar to those versed in the Western literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;http://mbdincaslan.com/index.php/koseyazilari/item/448-karsilastirmalimitoloji&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the story of a monster named "Goggle-eye" [[Tepegoz]] bears enough resemblance to the encounter with the [[Cyclops]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' that it is believed to have been influenced by the Greek epic or to have one common ancient Anatolian root. The book also describes in great detail the various sports activities of the ancient Turkic peoples: "Dede Korkut (1000–1300) clearly referred to certain physical activities and games. In Dede Korkut's description, the athletic skills of Turks, both men and women, were described to be "first-rate," especially in horse-riding, archery, [[cirit]] (javelin throw), wrestling and polo, which are considered Turkish national sports."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesportjournal.org/2003Journal/Vol6-No3/turkey.asp Dr. Ergun Yurdadon, Chair of Recreation Management, United State Sports Academy, ''Sport In Turkey: The Pre-Islamic Period'', Volume 6, Number 3, Summer 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218015220/http://www.thesportjournal.org/2003Journal/Vol6-No3/turkey.asp |date=2007-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''The Wisdom of Dede Korkut''':

===Manuscript tradition===
Since the early 18th century, the ''Book of Dede Korkut'' has been translated into French, English, Russian and Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;Bentinck, Histoire Genealogique des Tatars, 2 vols. (Leiden, 1726).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abu Al Ghazi Bahadur, A History of the Turks, Moguls, and Tatars, Vulgarly called Tartars, Together with a Description of the Countries They Inhabit, 2 vols. (London, 1730)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until it caught the attention of H.F. Von Diez, who published a partial German translation of Dede Korkut in 1815, based on a manuscript found in the Royal Library of [[Dresden]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.slub-dresden.de/ppn280873166 Kitab-i Dedem Korkut – Mscr.Dresd.Ea.86 digital]&lt;/ref&gt; that ''Dede Korkut'' became widely known to the West. The only other manuscript of ''Dede Korkut'' was discovered in 1950 by Ettore Rossi in the [[Vatican Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.turc.102 Kitab-i Dedem Korkut – Vat. turc. 102 digital]&lt;/ref&gt; Until ''Dede Korkut'' was transcribed on paper, the events depicted therein survived in the oral tradition, at least from the 9th and 10th centuries. The "Bamsi Beyrek" chapter of ''Dede Korkut'' preserves almost verbatim the immensely popular Central Asian dastan [[Alpamysh]], dating from an even earlier time. The stories were written in prose, but peppered with poetic passages. Recent research by Turkish and Turkmen scholars revealed, that the Turkmen variant of the ''Book of Dede Korkut'' contains sixteen stories, which have been transcribed and published in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtad.humanity.ankara.edu.tr/II-4_Aralik2005/oz2-42005/2-4oz_59merdem.htm Prof. Melek Erdem, Ankara University, "On the Connection with the Manuscripts of Turkmenistan Variant of Dede Korkut Epics". ''Journal of Modern Turkish Studies'' (2005), 2/4:158-188]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating the composition===
The work originated as a series of epics orally told and transferred over the generations before being published in book form. There are numerous versions collected of the stories. It is thought that the first versions were in natural verse, since Turkish is an agglutinative language, but that they gradually transformed into combinations of verse and prose as the Islamic elements affected the narrative over time.

Various dates have been proposed for the first written copies. [[Geoffrey Lewis (Turkish scholar)|Geoffrey Lewis]] dates it fairly early in the 15th century,&lt;ref name="Kafadar"&gt;{{harvp|Kafadar|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two layers of text: a substratum of older oral traditions related to conflicts between the Oghuz and the [[Pechenegs|Pecheneks]] and [[Kipchaks]] and an outer covering of references to the 14th-century campaigns of the [[Ag Qoyunlu|Akkoyunlu Confederation]].&lt;ref name="Meeker"&gt;Michael E. Meeker, "The Dede Korkut Ethic", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug., 1992), 395–417. "According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond."&lt;/ref&gt; Cemal Kafadar agrees that it was no earlier than the 15th century since "the author is buttering up both the [[Akkoyunlu]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rulers".{{#tag:ref|"It was not earlier than the 15th century. Based on the fact that the author is buttering up both the Akkoyunlu and Ottoman rulers, it has been suggested that the composition belongs to someone living in the undefined border region lands between the two states during the reign of [[Uzun Hassan]] (1466–78). G. Lewis on the hand dates the composition 'fairly early in the 15th century at least'."&lt;ref name="Kafadar"/&gt;|group=Note}} However, in his history of the Ottoman Empire, [[Stanford J. Shaw|Stanford Jay Shaw]] (1977) dates it in the 14th century.{{#tag:ref|"The greatest folk product of the 14th century was the prose collection of Dede Korkut, the oldest surviving examples of Oghuz Turkmen epic. ''Dede Korkut'' relates the struggles of Turkmens with the [[Georgians]] and [[Abazas|Abkhaza Circassians]] in the Caucasia as well as with the Byzantine [[Empire of Trebizond]], adding stories of relationships and conflicts within Turkomen tribes."&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Jay Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', Cambridge University, 1977, pg 141.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Professor Michael E. Meeker argues for two dates, saying that the versions of the stories we have today originated as folk stories and songs no earlier than the 13th century and were written down no later than the early the 15th century.{{#tag:ref|"''The Book of Dede Korkut'' is an early record of oral [[Turkish Folklore|Turkic folktales]] in [[Anatolia]], and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the ''Book of Dede Korkut'' consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among [[Turkic peoples]] living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern [[Azerbaijan]]. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves "Turcoman" rather than "Oghuz," had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether."&lt;ref name="Meeker"/&gt;|group=Note}} At least one of the stories (Chapter 8) existed in writing at the beginning of the 14th century, from an unpublished [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[history]], Dawadari's ''Durar al-Tijan'', written in [[Egypt]] some time between 1309 and 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1974|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precise determination is impossible to come by due to the nomadic lifestyle of the early [[Turkic people]], in which epics such as Dede Korkut passed from generation to generation in an oral form. This is especially true of an epic book such as this, which is a product of a long series of narrators, any of whom could have made alterations and additions, right down to the two 16th-century scribes who authored the oldest extant manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1974|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of scholars of ancient Turkic epics and folk tales, such as Russian-Soviet academician [[Vasily Bartold]] and British scholar [[Geoffrey Lewis Lewis|Geoffrey Lewis]], believe that the ''Dede Korkut'' text "exhibits a number of features characteristic of [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], the Turkish dialect of Azerbaijan".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1974|pp=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet treatment==
The majority of the Turkic peoples and lands described in the ''Book of Dede Korkut'' were part of the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] from 1920 until 1991, and thus most of the research and interest originated there. The attitude towards the Book of Dede Korkut and other dastans related to the Turkic peoples was initially neutral.

[[Turkey|Turkish]] historian [[Hasan Bülent Paksoy]] argues that after [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] solidified his grip on power in the USSR, and especially in the early 1950s, a taboo on [[Turkology]] was firmly established. He observed that the first full-text Russian edition of the Book of Dede Korkut, by Azerbaijani academicians [[Hamid Arasly|Hamid Arasli]] and M.G.Tahmasib and based on the Barthold translation of the 1920s, was published on a limited basis only in 1939 and again in 1950.&lt;ref name="aton.ttu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barthold|1962|pp=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts, "Turkic scholars and literati (who raised the same issues) were lost to the Stalinist 'liquidations' or to the 'ideological assault' waged on all dastans in 1950–52."&lt;ref name="aton.ttu.edu"/&gt; According to Paksoy, this taboo of the early 1950s was also expressed in the "Trial of Alpamysh" (1952–1957), when "all dastans of Central Asia were officially condemned by the Soviet state apparatus".

Soviet authorities criticized ''Dede Korkut'' for promoting [[bourgeois nationalism]]. In a 1951 speech delivered at the 18th Congress of the [[Azerbaijani Communist Party]], Azerbaijani communist leader [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]] advocated expunging the epic from [[Azerbaijani literature]], calling it a "harmful" and "antipopular book" that "is shot through with the poison of nationalism, chiefly against the [[Georgians|Georgian]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] brother-peoples."&lt;ref&gt;"Report by Comrade M[ir] D[zhafar Abbasovich] Bagirov at 18th Congress of Azerbaidzhan Communist Party on the Work of the Azerbaidzhan Communist Party Central Committee," ''Current Digest of the Russian Press'' No. 24, Vol. 23 (July 28, 1951), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the publication of dastans did not wholly cease during that period, as editions of ''Alpamysh'' were published in 1957, 1958 and 1961,&lt;ref&gt;"Alpamysh" entry in ''Bol'shaya sovetskaya entsiklopediya'' (the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', third edition) [https://archive.is/20070808014724/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/021/110.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; as they had been in 1939, 1941, and 1949;&lt;ref&gt;''Alpamysh'' entry in ''Bol'shaya sovetskaya entsiklopediya'' (the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', second edition)&lt;/ref&gt; the entry on dastans in the second edition of the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' (volume 13, 1952) does not contain any "condemnation" either.&lt;ref&gt;"Dastan" in ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', second edition. See also "Dastan" [https://archive.is/20050526183524/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/019/701.htm] entry in the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', third edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the liberalization of the political climate after the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|denunciation of Stalinism]] by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in February 1956, the same "Barthold" edition of the ''Book of Dede Korkut'' was re-published only in 1962 and in 1977. Problems persisted all the way to [[perestroika]], when the last full edition in [[Azerbaijani language]] was sent for publication on July 11, 1985, but received permission for printing only on February 2, 1988.&lt;ref name="aton.ttu.edu"/&gt;

==UNESCO celebrations==

In 1998, the Republic of [[Azerbaijan]] and [[UNESCO]] nominated, and in 2000 celebrated, the "One thousand three hundredth anniversary of the epic Azerbaijani legend Kitab-i Dede Qorqud".&lt;ref&gt;[http://erc.unesco.org/cp/cp.asp?country=AZ&amp;language=E UNESCO website, accessed March 19, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406220508/http://erc.unesco.org/cp/cp.asp?country=AZ&amp;language=E |date=April 6, 2007 }} [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=18568&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Celebration of anniversaries with which UNESCO was associated since 1996, UNESCO website, accessed March 19, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the General Director of UNESCO remarked: "Epics – and I have in mind in particular that of the Turkish-speaking peoples attributed to ''Dede Korkut'', perpetuated by oral tradition up to the 15th century before being written down...are vectors of the historical, geographical, political, social, linguistic and literary references of the peoples whose history they relate. Although many of these epics have already been noted down, the oral and gestural skills of the storytellers and griots who keep them alive should also be immortalized without delay. The matter is urgent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://aton.ttu.edu/unesco_dede_korkut.asp UNESCO, Address by Mr Koichiro Matsuura, Director-General of UNESCO, on the occasion of the information meeting with the Permanent Delegations on the project "Proclamation of masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity".

'''Elizabeth Lindley Post''' (May 7, 1920 – April 24, 2010) was an [[etiquette]] writer, the granddaughter-in-law of [[Emily Post]].

Born the third child of Allen Ledyard Lindley and Elizabeth Ellsworth Lindley,&lt;ref name=PRN_obit&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elizabeth-lindley-post-etiquette-author-successor-to-emily-post-dies-at-89-92043844.html Elizabeth Lindley Post, Etiquette Author, Successor to Emily Post, Dies at 89] PR Newswire&lt;/ref&gt; she was the great-granddaughter of [[Cyrus Field]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2725">'''Eresbil''', the [[Basque people|Basque]] music archive, is located in [[Errenteria]] ([[Gipuzkoa]], Spain). Its principal aim is the collection, preservation, protection and dissemination of the Basque musical heritage and, especially, the output of Basque composers.

It emerged in 1974 as a result of the need to set the repertory for Musikaste, a week music festival in Renteria devoted to the spreading of Basque composers. Jose Luis Ansorena, within the Andra Mari Choir, the organizer of Musikaste since 1973, took the initiative to create a center to collect the works that could be spread by this festival. The collection of scores of Basque-navarre composers throughout the time began in 1974.

Nowadays, it contains over 200,000 documents, 93,997 of which are audiovisual documents and 74,441 are sheets. Other 16,810 documents complete the collection, including books, magazines and microforms, and also 15,669 copies of varied documentation, such as letters, photographs, programs and posters.

The archive consists of different sections:

* Basque composers: at the beginning, the score collection of Basque–navarre composers was carried out through queries in libraries and archives, purchase and collaboration with creatives. Since 2000, a score legal deposit copy is collected from the Basque Country Autonomous Community.
* Archives collections: documentary collections, archives and individual libraries, as well as institutional collections, began to arrive in 1978, either in terms of donation or as assignment on depot.
* Sound archives: this section stores the sound records of the works created by Basque composers. At present, the initial scope has been enlarged to include the entire musical production which is edited in the Basque Country, as well as the one concerning Basque musicians. Since 2000 a sound recording legal deposit copy is collected from the Basque Country Autonomous Community.
* Musical library: this section compiles the main printed sources for the musical research development, with an important presence of reference works. Furthermore, it collects European score collections to help musicians find and study repertory.
* Documentation: this section collects all kind of materials related to composers and music subjects in documents such as articles, press, letters and reports, and it also contains a poster collection, programs, photographs and iconography.

The '''Estonian Sovereignty Declaration''' ({{lang-et|suveräänsusdeklaratsioon}}), fully: '''Declaration on the Sovereignty of the Estonian SSR''' (''Deklaratsioon Eesti NSV suveräänsusest''), was issued on November 16, 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Legal reform in post-communist Europe |last=Frankowski |first=Stanisław |authorlink= |author2=Paul B.

The declaration asserted [[Estonia]]'s [[sovereignty]] and the supremacy of the Estonian laws over the laws of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dissolution |last=Walker |first=Edward |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location= |isbn=0-7425-2453-1 |page=63 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y06eqVKtfQgC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia's parliament also laid claim to the republic's natural resources: land, inland waters, forests, mineral deposits and to the means of industrial production, agriculture, construction, state banks, transportation, municipal services, etc. in the territory of Estonia's borders.&lt;ref name="DS"/&gt; November 16 is now celebrated annually as the "Day of Declaration of Sovereignty".

==Overview==
[[Estonia]] gained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]] and [[Estonian War of Independence]] (1918–1920). In 1940 as a consequence of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact]] and its [[s:Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact#Secret Additional Protocol|Secret Additional Protocol]] of August 1939 Estonia was [[Estonia in World War II#Soviet occupation|occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union]].

The [[State continuity of the Baltic states#List of recognition and non-recognition of annexation|majority of Western nations refused to recognize]] the incorporation of Estonia ''[[de jure]]'' by the Soviet Union and only recognized the government of the Estonian SSR ''de facto'' or not at all.&lt;ref name="RGIL"&gt;{{cite book |title=Recognition of Governments in International Law |last=Talmon |first=Stefan |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-19-826573-3 |pages=103 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scc8EboiJX8C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of International Law |last=Aust |first=Anthony |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press, |location= |isbn=0-521-82349-8 |pages=26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EqO9rKIcoQMC&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such countries recognized Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian diplomats and consuls who still functioned in the name of their former governments. These aging diplomats persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of Baltic independence.&lt;ref&gt;''Diplomats Without a Country: Baltic Diplomacy, International Law, and the Cold War'' by James T. McHugh, James S. Pacy, Page 2. {{ISBN|0-313-31878-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s new policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] were introduced and [[political repression in the Soviet Union]] came to an end. As a result, during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] a 20 August 1991 [[Estonian restoration of Independence|declaration proclaimed the reestablishment of the independent Estonian republic]] almost three years after the declaration was made, becoming the last of the Baltic republics to declare the reestablishment of independence (after Lithuania and Latvia in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of Estonia |last=Miljan |first=Toivo |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=0-8108-4904-6 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKWRct15XfkC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 1991, the Soviet Union recognized the independence of Estonia and the country was admitted to the [[United Nations|UN]] on September 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States 1999 |last=Europa Publications Limited |first= |year=1999 |publisher= |location= |isbn=1-85743-058-1 |page=333 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmN95fFocsMC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than three years of negotiations, on August 31, 1994, the armed forces of [[Russia]] withdrew from Estonia. The Russian Federation officially ended its military presence in Estonia after it relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in [[Paldiski]] in September 1995. Estonia joined the [[European Union]] in May 2004, shortly after it became a member of [[NATO]], and later joined the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in 2010.

'''Fanlore''' is a [[wiki]] created to preserve the history of transformative works, as well as that of [[Fan (person)|fans]], and [[fandoms]], with a focus on people and their activities rather than on fandom [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. The beta version of Fanlore launched in September 2008, and the wiki came out of beta in December 2010. As of June 2018, more than 45,000 pages have been created on Fanlore, with more than 780,000 edits made by more than 35,000 registered users.&lt;ref name="fandom1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.transformativeworks.org/fanlore/ |title=Fanlore |publisher=[[Organization for Transformative Works]] |access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanlore's focus is for fans to document their understandings of and experiences in fandom, past and present. The intent of its parent group, the non-profit [[Organization for Transformative Works]], is to preserve for future reference fandom occurrences, work done by fans, and their discussions and debates. The site's audiences include journalists, academics, and people new to fandom.&lt;ref name="fandom1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fandom2"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Digital Brands Inc |first=Amber |last=Brooks |date=May 15, 2017 |title=The Organization for Transformative Works: An Enthusiastic Community of Volunteers Preserves &amp; Celebrates Fanworks |url=https://archive.fo/afs2i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanlore is run by the Fanlore Committee within the Organization for Transformative Works. Additional volunteers termed Gardeners have extra editing access on the site, and they monitor recent edits to make sure all contributions are properly integrated. These volunteers also answer questions and provide help to fan contributors.

==Features and Culture==

Fanlore's major content categories include Fan Activities, Fan Communities, People, Fandoms, Perspectives on Fans, a Glossary, Tropes &amp; Genres, Fanworks and a Chronology.&lt;ref name="fandom2"/&gt;

Fanlore is guided by the Plural Point of View (PPOV) policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fanlore.org/wiki/Fanlore:Plural_Point_of_View |publisher=Fanlore |title=Fanlore:Plural Point of View |access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discussed by one of the Organization for Transformative Works' founders, Francesca Coppa:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fanlore is much much friendlier and more accepting and less confrontational than most wikis, which can be notoriously hostile places. We have a specific Plural Point of View philosophy and not just accept–but actively seek out–multiple viewpoints in all things.&lt;ref name="fanlore5"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://geekfeminism.org/2009/09/23/geek-feminism-interviews-the-otws-francesca-coppa/ |title=Geek Feminism interviews the OTW's Francesca Coppa |publisher=Geek Feminism |date=September 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801035536/https://geekfeminism.org/2009/09/23/geek-feminism-interviews-the-otws-francesca-coppa/ |archive-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the people who have been most active on Fanlore are older, more established fans interested in documenting fannish history prior to 2010, leading to a site with a particular focus on [[zines]] and fannish activities on [[LiveJournal]].&lt;ref name="fanlore5"/&gt; Fanlore continues to solicit contributions from fans with different experiences.

The site hosts regular editing challenges, such as the annual April Showers event and has its own social media outlets.&lt;ref name="fanlore3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fanlore.org/wiki/April_Showers_of_Fannish_History |publisher=Fanlore |title=April Showers of Fannish History |access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's creation and development largely by female fans has also meant a focus on fan history that reflects women's activities in fannish spaces.&lt;ref name="fanlore7"&gt;{{cite web |title=What We Believe |url=http://www.transformativeworks.org/what_we_believe/ |access-date=July 5, 2018 |publisher=[[Organization for Transformative Works]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

In May 2015, Fanlore announced that the site had been chosen by the [[American Folklife Center]], part of the [[U.S. Library of Congress]], for archiving as part of the Digital Culture Web Archive. The head of the American Folklife Center, Nicole Saylor, explained in 2016 that the site was selected because: "[F]an fiction and other kinds of fan works were identified as significant because fandom enacts so many of the key elements of folklore and vernacular culture. As a result, there are a range of fandom-focused sites that were selected for the collection. We were also interested in harvesting sites where communities had worked to synthesize, organize and collect examples of practice."&lt;ref name="fanlore27"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Organization for Transformative Works]] |title=OTW Guest Post: Nicole Saylor |first=Claudia |last=Rebaza |date=November 11, 2016 |url=http://www.transformativeworks.org/otw-guest-post-nicole-saylor/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210170515/http://www.transformativeworks.org/otw-guest-post-nicole-saylor/ |archive-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's content was captured from October 7, 2010 to August 5, 2016.&lt;ref name="fanlore28"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0010762/ |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |title=Fanlore |access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales''''', 548 U.S. 30 (2006), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case that considered Humberto Fernandez-Vargas, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] citizen who, after being [[deportation|deported]], [[illegal immigration|illegally reentered]] the United States in 1982, and remained undetected for over 20 years, fathering a son in 1989 and marrying the boy’s mother, a U.S. citizen, in 2001. He filed an application to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident, but the Government began proceedings to reinstate his 1981 deportation order under §241(a)(5), and deported him. 

Fernandez-Vargas argued that because he illegally reentered the country before [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996|IIRIRA]]'s effective date, §241(a)(5) did not bar his application for an adjustment of status, and that §241(a)(5) would be impermissibly retroactive if it did bar his adjustment application. The Court held that Section 241(a)(5) applies to those who reentered the U.S. before IIRIRA's effective date and does not retroactively affect any right of, or impose any burden on, the continuing violator of the INA now before this Court. {{Clarify|date=January 2011}}

'''''Griebens Reise-Bibliothek''''' (est.1853) was a series of German-language travel [[guide book]]s  to Europe, founded by Theobald Grieben of [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz23713.html |language=German |title= Carl Leopold Eberhard Theobald Grieben |work=[[Neue Deutsche Biographie]] |year=1966 |via=[[Deutsche Biographie]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some titles occasionally appeared in English or French language editions. Compared with its competitor ''[[Baedeker]]'', ''Griebens'' was "cheaper and less detailed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='What Ought to Be Seen': Tourists' Guidebooks and National Identities in Modern Germany and Europe |author= Rudy Koshar |journal= Journal of Contemporary History |volume= 33 |date=July 1998 |jstor=261119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1914 British reviewer judged it "informative and not bulky, going easily into the coat pocket."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Among the Books |work=[[T.P.'s Weekly]] |date=June 26, 1914 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=byXnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA814 |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers included [[Thomas Wolfe]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell2006"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Ted Mitchell|title=Thomas Wolfe: An Illustrated Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJvgQJOfigcC&amp;pg=PA186 |page=186 |year=2006|publisher=Pegasus |isbn=978-1-933648-10-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 publisher Albert Goldschmidt bought the series and continued it;&lt;ref name="jager2001"&gt;{{cite book |title= Geschichte des Deutschen Buchhandels im 19. und 20.

''[http://www.mnh.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/markland/history.html Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As some writers refer to all land beyond [[Greenland]] as Vinland, Helluland is sometimes considered a part of Vinland.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Etymology==
The name Helluland was given by [[Leif Erikson]] during his voyage to [[Vinland]] according to the [[Greenland Saga]] and means "Land of Flat Rocks" or "Land of Flat Stones" in the [[Old Norse language]].

== According to the sagas==
Helluland was said to be the first of three lands in North America visited by Eriksson.  He decided against trying to settle there because he found the land inhospitable. He continued south to ''[[Markland]]'' (probably [[Labrador]]) and ''[[Vinland]]'' (possibly [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is L'Anse aux Meadows Vinland? |work=L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site of Canada |publisher=[[Parks Canada]] |date=12 December 2003 |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/nl/meadows/natcul/vinland_e.asp |access-date=20 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522105216/http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/nl/meadows/natcul/vinland_e.asp |archive-date=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Saga of Erik the Red,'' 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They sailed away from land; then to the [[Western Settlement]] and to Bjarneyjar (the Bear Islands). Thence they sailed away from Bjarneyjar with northerly winds. They were out at sea two half-days. Then they came to land, and rowed along it in boats, and explored it, and found there flat stones, many and so great that two men might well lie on them stretched on their backs with heel to heel. Polar-foxes were there in abundance. This land they gave name to, and called it Helluland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en |title=The Saga of Erik the Red |work=The Icelandic Saga Database |publisher=Sveinbjörn Þórðarson |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [the land of flat stones]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Saga of Halfdan Eysteinsson ([[Hálfdanar saga Eysteinssonar]]), written no earlier than the mid-14th century a fragment says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hardman |first1=George L. |title=Hálfdanar saga Eysteinssonar |url=http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/HalfdanEysteinssonHardman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ragnar brought Helluland's obygdir under his sway and destroyed all the giants there..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Written in the last half of the 13th century an anonymous Icelandic ''[[fornaldarsaga]]'' , describes the attempts of [[Örvar-Oddr]] and his son Vignor to track down an enemy named Ogmund:&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{cite book |title=The Finding of Wineland the Good: The History of the Icelandic Discovery of America |first=Arthur Middleton |last=Reeves |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qt4_AQAAMAAJ |page=91 |publisher=[[H. Frowde]] |year=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hermann Palsson|first=Paul Edwards|title=Seven Viking Romances|year=1985|publisher=Penguin Books Canada Ltd|location=10 Alcorn Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4V 3B2|isbn=978-0-14-044474-2|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I will tell you where Ogmund has gone. He has gone into the [[Skuggifjord]] (Hudson Strait), it is in Helluland's Obygdir (unihabited regions)... he has gone there because he wishes to escape you. But now you may track him to his house if you wish and see what comes of it."

"Thereupon he (and his son Vignor in separate ships) sailed until they came into the Greenland Sea (which lay between Iceland and Greenland) when they turned south and sailed around the land and to the west... They sailed then until they came to Helluland and laid their course into the Skuggifjord..."

"When they reached the land (which they were seeking in the Skuggifjord) father and son went ashore and walked until they saw a fortified structure very strongly built..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In ancient Icelandic scholarship===
According to a footnote in Arthur Middleton Reeves's ''The Norse Discovery of America'' (1906), "the whole of the northern coast of America, west of Greenland, was called by the ancient Icelandic geographers Helluland it Mikla, or Great Helluland; and the island of Newfoundland simply Helluland, or Litla Helluland."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/nda/nda20.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current scholarly opinion===
[[Image:Baffin Island Northeast Coast 1997-08-07.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Coast of the [[Remote Peninsula]] in [[Sam Ford Fjord]], northeast [[Baffin Island]].]]
The Icelandic ''[[Saga of Erik the Red]]'' and the ''[[Greenland Saga]]'' characterized Helluland as a land of flat stones ([[Old Norse]]: ''hella''). Most scholars agree that Helluland corresponds to [[Baffin Island]] in the present-day [[Provinces and Territories of Canada|Canadian territory]] of [[Nunavut]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jónas Kristjánsson]] et al. (2012) "Falling into Vínland", ''[[Acta Archaeologica]]'' 83, pp. 145-177&lt;/ref&gt;

From the testimony of the sagas, the [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse explorers]] probably made contact with the native [[Dorset culture]] of the region, people whom the sagas term ''[[skræling]]s''.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Historians{{who|date=May 2012}} suggest the contact had no major cultural ramifications for either side.

[[Patricia Sutherland]] of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] originally found in the museum's collections yarn collected in archaeological digs on Baffin Island that corresponded to that found in Viking settlements in Greenland, which led her to explore in depth the potential that Vikings had settled on Baffin Island. Over a number of years searching in collections and digging at sites such as [[Tanfield Valley]], she found numerous artifacts, such as tally sticks, signs of iron and bronze metallurgy and [[sharpening stone|whetstone]]s used for sharpening metal tools, and European-style masonry and turf construction, which indicated to her that the Vikings had been on Baffin for an extended period and likely had an established trading relationship with the Dorset natives in the area.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sutherland's new findings further strengthen the case for a Viking camp on Baffin Island. "While her evidence was compelling before, I find it convincing now," said James Tuck, professor emeritus of archaeology, ... at Memorial University." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Heather |last=Pringle |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121019-viking-outpost-second-new-canada-science-sutherland/ |title=Evidence of Viking Outpost Found in Canada |newspaper=[[National Geographic magazine|National Geographic]] |date=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sutherland and the [[Helluland Archaeology Project]] among others have identified several potential pre-Columbian European archaeological sites including [[Tanfield Valley]], [[Avayalik]] at the far north of the [[Labrador Peninsula]], [[Willows Island]] at the southern part of Baffin Island, [[Pond Inlet]] (Nunguvik) in the far north of Baffin Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Helluland Archaeology Project |url=https://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/archeo/helluland/str0101e.shtml |publisher=[[Canadian Museum of History]] |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jason Wolkow Epstein''' (born August 25, 1928) is an American editor and publisher.

==Life and career==
Born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family on August 25, 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= Meyer |first=Eugene L.  |authorlink=   |title= Jason Epstein: Publishing Icon, Perennial Student  |publisher=Washington Independent Review of Books|date=April 17, 2012 |url=http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/index.php/features/jason-epstein-e2809949-publishing-icon-perennial-student |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts. An only child, he attended public schools in Milton, Massachusetts. He graduated from [[Columbia College of Columbia University]] in 1949 and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He received a Master of Arts degree from Columbia the following year and joined [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and Company as an editorial trainee.

At Doubleday, he saw the need for inexpensive, well made paperbacks of the kinds of books that his classmates, many of them veterans studying on the GI Bill, were reading but couldn't afford to own in their hardcover editions. With the support of Ken McCormick, Doubleday's chief editor, he launched [[Anchor Books]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishinghistory.com/anchor-books-doubleday.html Anchor Books (Doubleday) - Book Series List], publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 20 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the first so-called Quality Paperbacks, which quickly became the dominant paperback format. In 1954 Anchor Books won the Carey-Thomas Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Satterfield|first1=Jay|title=The World's Best Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbCKjNuBl64C&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=carey-thomas+award+publishers+weekly+%22anchor+books%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lx4L5Eeh-r&amp;sig=70WHibexqB5vz74EFe6TiNt5v5c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rJkZVZnFA-LjsATCrILoCQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=carey-thomas%20award%20publishers%20weekly%20%22anchor%20books%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1958 he left Doubleday to join Random House where he served as editorial director until his retirement in 1999. At Random House he edited such writers as [[Jane Jacobs]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Philip Roth]], [[Derek Jeter]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[E. L. Doctorow]], [[Michael Korda]] and [[Peter Matthiessen]]. During the New York newspaper strike of 1963 Epstein, his wife [[Barbara Epstein|Barbara]] and their friends [[Robert Lowell]] and [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]] created ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' and turned to their friend [[Robert B. Silvers|Robert Silvers]] to be its editor along with Epstein's wife Barbara.

In 1979 he took up and forwarded the critic [[Edmund Wilson's]] concept for the [[Library of America]], well-made, reliable editions of important American writers similar to the French Pleiade editions. With the support of the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, the first volumes were published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Mission|url=http://www.loa.org/page.jsp?id=201|publisher=The Library of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later published ''The Reader's Catalogue'' of 40,000 titles available by mail order, an analog precursor of online book selling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lehmann-Haupt|first1=Christopher|title=Books of the Times; A Catalogue as Reference and Revolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/books/books-of-the-times-a-book-catalogue-as-reference-and-revolution.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 2, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he co-founded On Demand Books, marketer of the [[Espresso Book Machine]], which reproduces a paperback book from a digital file in a few minutes. Epstein has predicted that the Espresso Book Machine will supplant the 500-year-old Gutenberg technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Jason|title=Book Business|date=January 2001|publisher=W.

'''Jure Grando Alilović''' or '''Giure Grando ''' (1579 – 1656) was a villager from the region of [[Istria]]  (in modern-day [[Croatia]]) who may have been the first real person described as a [[vampire]] in historical records.&lt;ref name="Peric"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ice.hr/davors/simotamo_BorisPeric.htm | language = Croatian | title = Intervju: Boris Perić |trans-title=Interview with Boris Perić | newspaper = [[Glas Istre]] | date = 2005-10-01 | accessdate = 2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was referred to as a ''strigoi'', ''štrigon'' or ''štrigun'', a local word for something resembling a vampire and a [[warlock]].&lt;ref name="Vinšćak-2005"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=8023&amp;lang=en | title = O štrigama, štrigunima i krsnicima u Istri |trans-title=On "Štrige", "Štriguni" and "Krsnici" on Istrian Peninsula | first = Tomo | last = Vinšćak | journal = Studia ethnologica Croatica | volume = 17 |date=December 2005 | issn = 1330-3627 | publisher = Department of Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology, [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb]] | accessdate = 2011-11-04 | format = PDF | page = 231 | quote = Drago Orlić je još prije dvadesetak godina (Orlić, 1986) prikupio i tiskao vrlo zanimljivo gradivo o ukorijenjenosti i životnosti tradicije vezane uz  štrige i štrigune u Istri.

== History ==
Jure Grando lived in [[Kringa]], a small town in the interior of the Istrian peninsula near [[Tinjan]]. He died in 1656 due to illness but according to legend, returned from the grave at night as a vampire (''štrigon'') and terrorised his village until his decapitation in 1672. Ana and Nikola Alilović, daughter and son of Jure, fled from Istria to Volterra, Italy at young ages.&lt;ref name="Giure"&gt;{{cite book |last=Caron|first=Richard|title=Ésotérisme, gnoses &amp; imaginaire symbolique: mélanges offerts à Antoine Faivre|year=2001|chapter=Dracula's Family Tree|pages=598 |publisher=Peteers, Bondgenotenlaan 153|location=Belgium|isbn=90-4290955--2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
The legend tells that, for 16 years after his death, Jure would arise from his grave by night and terrorise the village.&lt;ref name="Vampire"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wright |first= Dudley|title= The Book of Vampires|origyear= 1924|edition= 2nd|location= Mineola, New York|publisher= Dover Publications, Inc.|year= 2006|isbn= 0-486-44998-X |pages= 49–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The village priest, Giorgio, who had buried Jure sixteen years previously discovered that at night somebody would knock on the doors around the village, and on whichever door he knocked, someone from that house would die within the next few days.

Jure also appeared to his terrified widow in her bedroom, who described the corpse as looking as though he was smiling and gasping for breath, and would then sexually assault her.&lt;ref name="Croatian Dracula"&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-04-24-croatian-dracula-revived-to-lure-tourists Croatian Dracula Revived to Lure Tourists]&lt;/ref&gt; When Father Giorgio eventually came face to face with the vampire, he held out a cross in front of him and yelled "Behold Jesus Christ, you vampire! Stop tormenting us!"

The bravest of the villagers led by the prefect Miho Radetić chased and tried to kill the vampire by piercing his heart with a [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] stick, but failed because the stick just bounced off of his chest.&lt;ref name="Croatian Dracula" /&gt; One night later, nine people went to the graveyard, carrying a cross, lamps and a hawthorn stick. They dug up Jure's coffin, and found a perfectly preserved corpse with a smile on its face.&lt;ref name="Istria strigon"&gt;[http://boravak.hr/hr/full/istrazujemo/s/jure-grando-istarski-vampir-ili-ljudska-masta/56/ Jure Grando - Istarski vampir ili ljudska mašta?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217125732/http://boravak.hr/hr/full/istrazujemo/s/jure-grando-istarski-vampir-ili-ljudska-masta/56 |date=2010-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Father Giorgio said: "Look, ''štrigon'', there is Jesus Christ who saved us from hell and died for us. And you, ''štrigon'', you cannot have peace!"&lt;ref name="Istria strigon" /&gt; They then tried to pierce its heart again, but the stick could not penetrate its flesh.&lt;ref name="Giure" /&gt;

After some [[exorcism]] prayers, Stipan Milašić (one of the villagers), took a saw and sawed the head off the corpse. As soon as the saw tore his skin, the vampire screamed and blood started to flow from the cut. According to folklore, peace finally returned to the region after Jure's decapitation.

In [[Hinduism]], Khatushyam is a name and manifestation of '''Barbaric''', grandson of Bhima and son of Mata Ahilyavati (daughter of Basuki Naag).  This manifestation is especially popular in the [[India]]n state of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]]. The original Sanskrit name ''Barbarīka'' is often replaced in Rajasthan by the [[Hindi]] version, ''Barbarīk'', often written as ''Barbareek''.

In the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', '''Barbarika''', '''Baliyadev''' ([[IAST]] Barbarīka) was the son of [[Ghatotkacha]] and Maurvi ([[Ahilawati]]), daughter of Muru, a [[Yadu|Yadava]] king.&lt;ref name="Parmeshwaranand2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parmeshwaranand|first=Swami|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6F0ZIBIL2ZAC&amp;pg=PA155|year=2001|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-226-3|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though other references state he is a Warrior from the South. Barbarika was originally a [[yaksha]], and was reborn as a man. He was bound by his principle of always fighting on the losing side, which led him to stand witness to the battle of [[Mahabharata]] without taking part in it. In Nepali culture Kirata King [[Yalamber]] of [[Nepal]] is portrayed as Barbarika while Native of Kathmandu Valley portrait him as [[Akash Bhairav]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/02-13/features2739.htm |title={title} |access-date=17 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225033948/http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/02-13/features2739.htm |archive-date=25 February 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rajasthan]], he is worshiped as Khatushyamji, and In [[Gujarat]], he is worshiped as Baliyadev is believed to have been sacrificed before the Mahabharata war to ensure the victory of his grandfathers, the [[Pandavas]]. In return for his sacrifice, he was deified by a boon given by [[Krishna]].

==Barbarika (Belarsen) and his dialog with Krishna==
Barbarika alias Khatushyamji Baliyadev alias Shyam was a grandson of [[Bhima]] (second of the [[Pandava]] brothers), and the son of Ghatotkacha. [[Ghatotkacha]] was the son of [[Bhima]] and [[Hidimbi]]. Even in his childhood, Barbarika was a very brave warrior. He learnt the art of warfare from his mother. The gods (''ashtadeva'') gave him the three infallible arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&amp;lpg=PA431 |title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics |author=[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780226340555 |page=431 |access-date=28 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012600/https://books.google.ca/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&amp;lpg=PA431 |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Barbarika came to be known as "Bearer of Three Arrows".
When Barbarika learnt that battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas had become inevitable, he wanted to witness what was to be the Mahābhārata War. He promised his mother that if he felt the urge to participate in the battle, he would join the side which would be losing. He rode to the field on his Blue Horse equipped with his three arrows and bow.

Before the [[Mahabharata]] war began, Lord [[Krishna]] asked all the warriors how many days they would take to finish Mahabharata war alone. [[Bhishma]] answered that he would take 20 days to finish the war. [[Dronacharya]] replied that it would take him 25 days. When [[Karna]] was asked, he said he would take 24 days. [[Arjuna]] told Krishna it would take 28 days for him to complete the battle by himself. In this manner, Lord Krishna asked each warrior and received an answer.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Krishna disguised as a Brahmin, stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. When asked how many days he would take to finish the war alone, Barbarika answered that he could finish it in one minute. Krishna then asked Barbarika how he'd finish the great battle with just three arrows. Barbarika replied that a single arrow was enough to destroy all his opponents in the war, and it would then return to his quiver. He stated that, the first arrow is used to mark all the things that he wants to destroy. If he uses the second arrow, then the second arrow will mark all the things that he wants to save. On using the third arrow, it will destroy all the things that are not marked and then return to his quiver. In other words, with one arrow he can fix all his targets and with the other he can destroy them.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Krishna then challenged him to tie all the leaves of the Peepal tree under which he was standing, using his arrows. Barbarika Baliyadev accepts the challenge and starts meditating to release his arrow by closing his eyes. As Barbarika starts meditating, Krishna quietly plucks a leaf from the tree and hides it under his foot. When Barbarika releases his first arrow, it marks all the leaves of the tree and finally started hovering around the leg of Krishna. Krishna asks Barbarika why the arrow was hovering over his foot. Barbarika replies that there must be a leaf under his foot and the arrow was targeting his foot to mark the leaf that is hidden underneath. Barbarika advises Krishna to lift his leg, otherwise the arrow would mark the leaf by piercing Krishna's foot. Krishna then lifts his foot and the first arrow also marks the hidden leaf. The third arrow then collects all the leaves (including the hidden leaf ) and ties them together. By this Krishna concludes that the arrows are so powerful and infallible, that even if Barbarika is unaware of the whereabouts of his targets, his arrows can still navigate and trace his intended targets. The moral of this incident is that, in a real battle field, if Krishna wants to isolate someone (for example: the 5 Pandava brothers) and hide them elsewhere in order to prevent them from being Barbarika's victim, he would not be successful as the arrows could trace even the hidden targets and destroy them. So, nobody would be able to escape from these arrows. Thus Krishna gets a deeper insight about Barbarika's phenomenal power.

Krishna then asks the boy whom he would favour in the war. Barbarika reveals that he intends to fight for the side whichever is weak. As the Pandavas have only seven [[Akshauhini]] armies compared to the eleven of the Kauravas, he considers that the Pandavas to be relatively the weaker side and hence wants to support them. But Krishna asks him, if he had seriously given a thought about the consequences, before giving such a word to his mother (about supporting the weaker side). Barbarika assumes that his support, to the relatively weaker Pandava side, will make them victorious. But, Krishna reveals the actual consequences of his word to his mother:

Krishna tells that whichever side he supports will end up making the other side weaker due to his power. Nobody will be able to defeat him. Hence, as he will be forced switch sides to support the other side that has become weaker (due to his word to his mother). Thus, in an actual war, he will keep oscillating between two sides, thereby destroying the entire army of both sides and eventually only he would remain. Subsequently, none of the sides would become victorious and he would be the lone survivor. Hence, Krishna avoids his participation in the war by seeking his head in charity.

==Krishna's leg==
The other version of story tells that the first arrow indeed pierces Krishna's leg and marks the leaf that is hidden under Krishna's foot. This becomes a weak spot of Krishna. Prior to this event, lord Krishna also gets a boon from sage [[Durvasa]] that his entire body except his leg will be immune to all weapons. Hence, only his leg will be vulnerable. Later, in the Mausala parva, a hunter by name Jara, hits Krishna's foot with arrows, mistaking him for a deer. This leads to the death of Krishna. In other words, this weak spot on Krishna's foot was first created by Barbarika's arrow.

==The other interpretation of three arrows==
The three arrows are signs of three 'taapa's that a human being experiences. These include the physical, the mental and the emotional turmoils, conflicts and confusions that are found almost everywhere. These three 'taapa's are cleared with chanting of name of Shri Krishna. Thus, giving Barabarika the name "Shyaam", the Lord intended to remove the three 'taapa's of human life, symbolized by the three arrows, without which it might not be possible to destroy or overcome the 'taapa's.

One another legend says that the three arrows of Barabarika can be used as follows: First arrow to mark all the near and dear ones, relatives, etc., Second arrow to mark the people who are not part of the war or who are not taking any side in the war, and the third arrow to destroy everything that is not marked by first and second arrows. This was the speciality of Barbarika's three arrows.

==Act of charity==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Reengus Temple Art6.JPG|thumb|Barbarika donates his head to [[Krishna]].]]

Krishna then explained to him that before a battle, the head of the bravest Kshatriya needs to be sacrificed, in order to worship/sanctify the battlefield. Krishna said that he considered Barbarika to be the bravest among Kshatriyas, and was hence asking for his head in charity. In fulfillment of his promise, and in compliance with the Krishna's command, Barbarika gave his head to him in charity. This happened on the 12th day of the Shukla Paksha (bright half) of the month of Phaagun on Tuesday. Barbarika was a Yaksha in his previous birth. Once Lord [[Brahma]] and several other Devas came to [[Vaikuntha]] and complained to Lord [[Vishnu]] that the [[Adharma]] on Earth was increasing; it was not possible for them to bear the tortures causes by the wicked people. Hence they came to seek the help of Lord Vishnu to check them. Lord Vishnu told the Devas that he will soon be incarnated on Earth as a human being and destroy all the evil forces. Then, a Yaksha told the Devas that he alone is enough to kill all evil elements on the Earth, and it was not necessary for Lord Vishnu to descend to Earth. This hurt Lord Brahma very much. Lord Brahma cursed this Yaksha that whenever the time comes to eliminate all the evil forces on Earth, then Lord Vishnu will first kill him. Later, the [[Yaksha]] takes birth as Barbarika and Lord Krishna seeks his head in charity as a result of this curse.

==Bearing witness to the war==
Before decapitating himself, Barbarika told Krishna of his great desire to view the forthcoming battle and requested him to facilitate the same. Krishna agreed and placed the head on top of a hill overlooking the battlefield. From the hill, the head of Barbarika watched the entire battle.

At the end of the battle, the victorious Pandava brothers argued among themselves as to who was responsible for their victory. Krishna suggested that Barbarika's head, which had watched the whole battle should be allowed to judge. Barbarika's head suggested that it was Krishna alone who was responsible for the victory.
Barbarika replies, “All I could see were two things. One, a divine chakra spinning all around the battle field, killing all those who were not on the side of Dharma. The other was the [[Draupadi]] who has taken her original form of Goddess [[Mahakali]], who spread out her tongue on the battle field and consumed all the sinners as her sacrifice". Listening to this, [[Pandava|Pandavas]] realized that it was Lord [[Narayana]] and Goddess [[Parvati]] (Mahakali) who actually cleaned up the world from Adharma, and the Pandavas were mere instruments.

His other name is God Kamrunaag and is venerated as the preeminent deity in District Mandi, in Himachal Pradesh. A pond and a temple are situated in Kamru hill in Sundernagar, District Mandi. He witnessed the entire battle of Kurukshetra from the hill which is now known as [[Khatushyam Temple]], located in [[Khatu]] village in [[Sikar district|Sikar District]], [[Rajasthan]]. An impressive and especially sacred Temple of Baliyadev, Barbarik is situated at village [[Lambha]] in [[Ahmedabad District]], [[Gujarat]].
==Observances and festivals==
Barbarika is worshiped as Shyam, being Krishna himself. Therefore, the flavour of the festivities reflects the playful and vibrant nature of Krishna. The festivals of [[Krishna Janmaashtami]], ''Jhool Jhulani Ekadashi'', [[Holi]] and ''[[Vasant Panchami]]'' are celebrated with gusto in the temple. The ''Phalguna Mela'' detailed below is the principal annual festival.

Hundreds of devotees visit the temple every day. Newly married couples come to pay homage and newborn babies are brought to the temple for their ''mundan'' (the first hair-shaving) ceremony. An elaborate [[aarti]] is performed at the temple five times a day. These are:
* ''Mangala Aarti'': performed in the early morning, when temple is open.
* ''Shringaar Aarti'': performed at the time of make-up of Baba Shyam. The idol is grandly ornamented for this aarti.
* ''Bhog Aarti'': performed at noon when ''bhog'' ([[Prasadam]]) is served to the Lord.
* ''Sandhya Aarti'': performed in the evening, at sunset.

Two special hymns, the "Shri Shyam Aarti" and the "Shri Shyam Vinati," are chanted on all these occasions. The Shyam mantra is another litany of the Lord's names that is chanted by devotees.

Other particular observances include:

'''Shukla Ekadashi and Dwadashi:''' The 11th and 12th days of the bright half of every month in the Hindu calendar is of special significance to the temple. This is because Barbarika was born on the 11th day of the bright half of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]], and he donated his head (''Sheesh'') to Krishna on the 12th day of the bright half of the month of phaagun on Tuesday. ''Darshan'' on these two days is therefore considered auspicious and devotees come in their thousands every month. The temple remains open throughout the night that falls between these days. Night-long ''[[Bhajan]]'' sessions are organised since devotees traditionally pass the night in singing the praises of the Lord. Devotees organise Bhajan programmes and invite Bhajan singers to sing devotional songs.

'''Bathing in the Shyam Kund:''' This is the holy pond near the temple from which the idol was retrieved. It is believed that a dip in this pond cures a person from ailments and brings good health. Filled with devotional fervor, people take ritual dips in the ''Shyam Kund.'' They believe that this will relieve them of diseases and contagion. Bathing during the annual [[Phalguna Mela in Khatushyamji|Phalguna Mela]] festival is deemed specially salutary.

'''Nishan Yatra:''' It is believed that your wishes are granted if you offer a ''Nishan'' at the temple. A ''Nishan'' is a triangular flag of a particular size, made of cloth, which is hoisted on a bamboo stick. It is carried in one's hands while covering the route from the town of Ringas to Khatu (17&amp;nbsp;km) on (bare) foot. ''Nishans'' are offered in millions during the ''Phalguna Mela.''

'''[[Phalguna Mela]]:''' The most important festival associated with the temple is the [[Phalguna Mela in Khatushyamji|Phalguna Mela]] which occurs just 8–9 days before from the festival of [[Holi]]. Barbarika's head appeared on ''Phalguna Shuddha Ekadashi,'' the 11th day of the bright half of the Hindu month of [[Phalguna]]. Therefore, the fair is held from the 9th to the 12th of that month. The fair has now been extended to nearly 12–15 days of the bright half of the Phalguna Month.

[[File:Khatushyamji Rath1.JPG|thumb|200px|Khatushyamji Rath idol during [[Padayatra|Pad Yatra]] from [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]] to Khatushyamji in 2008 ]]

On this holy occasion pilgrims all over the country come here on foot with [[nishaan]]s (holy mark - [[flag]]s) in their hands. People enjoy their holy journey by singing ''[[Khatushyamji|shyam]] [[bhajan]]s'' and playing various musical instruments. They enjoy the journey by playing ''holi'' with [[gulal]]. Many Shyam [[Bhakta]]s supply food to pedestrians in the shade of tents. They encourage also to complete their journey with full enthusiasm. They enjoy this occasion as the marriage of Khatushyamji. People enjoy the [[mela]] by purchasing various things. On Dwadashi (= 12th day of month), [[Bhog]] is being prepared as Baba's [[Prasadi]] of [[Kheer]], [[Churama]].

Special arrangements for security are made to control the crowd. Around 500,000 people visit in three days of this holy mela in this small village. To briefly see Baba Shyam's idol, a very tight security is made  with the help of [[bamboo]] fence around {{convert|2|km}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3250">'''Kuterastan''' is the [[Creator_deity|creator]] in a creation myth of the [[Plains Apache|Kiowa Apache]] from the southern plains of [[North America]].  His name means One Who Lives Above.

The story of his creation tells that in the beginning, before there were earth or sky there was only darkness. Into it came a small and thin disc with yellow and white on its alternate sides, and inside it sat Kuterastan, a small bearded man no larger than a frog.  Kuterastan is described as awakening and rubbing his eyes.  When he peers above him into the darkness it filled with light and illuminated the darkness below.  When he looked east the light became tinged with the yellow of dawn, and when he looked west the light was shaded with the amber tones of dusk. As he glanced about himself clouds in different colors appeared. Then again Kuterastan rubbed his eyes and face, and as he flung the sweat from his hands another cloud appeared with a tiny little girl Stenatliha sitting on top.  Stenatliha's name translates as the Woman Without Parents.  Kuterastan and Stenatliha were puzzled where the other had come from, and where were the Earth and Sky.  After thinking for some time, Kuterastan again rubbed his eyes and face, then his hands together, and from the sweat flying as he opened hands first Chuganaai, the Sun, and then Hadintin Skhin, or Pollen Boy, appeared.  After the four sat a long time in silence on a single cloud, Kuterastan finally broke the silence to say, "What shall we do?" and started the creation.

The story describes the sequence, with Nacholecho, the [[Tarantula]], the first to be created. Kuterastan followed by making the [[Big Dipper]], the wind, lightning, and thunder, each given their characteristic tasks.  Finding the cloud a poor home, he then turned his attention to making the earth.  With the sweat of the four gods mixed together in Kuterastan's palms there emerged a small brown ball no bigger than a bean. This was expanded as the gods kicked the small brown ball. Then the wind went inside the ball and to inflate it. Tarantula attached to the ball a spun black cord and stretched it far to the east. Tarantula also attached one cord each of blue, yellow and white to the ball pulling one far to the south, another west, and the last to the north.  When Tarantula was finished, the earth was vast expanse of smooth brown plain.  Poles were placed at each corner to hold the earth in place. And at this Kuterastan sang a repeating refrain, "The world is now made and it sits still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Image Taker |chapter=Apache Creation Story |page=46 |last=Hausman |first=Gerald |year=2009 |publisher=World Wisdom Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilhawaii.net/~stony/lore34.html |title=Apache Creation Story |publisher=StoneE Producktions |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The North American Indian |last=Curtis |first=Edward S. |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2009 |isbn=0-559-12603-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnApr9HhrowC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Leyner''' (born 1956) is an American [[postmodern literature|postmodernist]] author.

==Career==
Leyner employs an intense and unconventional style in his works of [[fiction]]. His stories are generally humorous and absurd: In ''The Tetherballs of Bougainville'', Mark's father survives a lethal injection at the hands of the New Jersey penal system, and so is freed but must live the remainder of his life in fear of being executed, at New Jersey's discretion, in any situation and regardless of collateral damage. They frequently incorporate elements of [[metafiction|meta-fiction]]: In the same novel, an adolescent Mark produces a film adaptation of the story of his father's failed execution, although he reads a newspaper review of the movie to the prison's warden, and then dies, before even leaving the prison.  At the sentence level, Leyner uses sprawling imagery and an extravagant vocabulary, bordering on [[prose poetry]].

Leyner has also worked as a columnist for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' and ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'' magazines, and as a writer for the [[MTV]] program ''[[Liquid Television]]''. He also co-wrote and voiced a short-lived series of audio fiction called ''Wiretap''.

Leyner also studied with noted post-modern author [[Steve Katz (writer)|Steve Katz]] at the University of Colorado-Boulder.

==Life==
During the 1990s, Leyner was a resident of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], together with his dog Carmella.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/13/magazine/the-ridiculous-vision-of-mark-leyner.html?pagewanted=all "The Ridiculous Vision of Mark Leyner"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 13, 1992. Accessed February 6, 2013. "When Leyner says, 'Stop it, Carmella,' or 'Get over here,' the dog ignores him, and continues to sow chaos in her master's apartment in Hoboken, N.J."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-to-late 2000s, Leyner collaborated with Dr. [[Billy Goldberg (doctor)|Billy Goldberg]] on three humorous, though fact-based, books on medicine.

He is credited with co-authoring the screenplay of ''[[War, Inc.]]''

In 2012, Leyner published his first novel in fourteen years, ''[[The Sugar Frosted Nutsack]].''

The '''memorandum of association''' of a [[company (law)|company]] is an important corporate document in certain jurisdictions. It is often simply referred to as the '''memorandum'''.  In the UK, it has to be filed with the [[Registrar of Companies]] during the process of incorporating a company. It is the document that regulates the company’s external affairs,&lt;ref&gt;http://thelawstudies.blogspot.com/2017/01/memorandum-of-association-of-company.html&lt;/ref&gt; and complements the [[articles of association]] which cover  the company's internal constitution. It contains the fundamental conditions under which the company is allowed to operate. Until recently{{Where|date=November 2018}} it had to include the "objects clause" which let the shareholders, creditors and those dealing with the company know what is its permitted range of operation, although this was usually drafted very broadly. It also shows the company's initial capital. It is one of the documents required to incorporate a [[company (law)|company]] in [[India]], the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |  url = http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/memorandum-of-association/ | title = Memorandum of Association Law &amp; Legal definition | format = w  | accessdate = 2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Nigeria]], Nepal, [[Bangladesh]], Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and [[Tanzania]] and is also used in many of the [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mca.gov.in/SearchableActs/Schedule1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements: United Kingdom==
It is still a requirement to file a memorandum of association to incorporate a new company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |  url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/memorandum%20of%20association | title = Memorandum of association  | format = w  | accessdate = 2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it contains less information than was required before 1 October 2010. The [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/3014/pdfs/uksi_20083014_en.pdf Companies (Registration) Regulation 2008] included pro-forma Memoranda.

It is basically a statement that the subscribers wish to form a company under the Companies Act 2006, have agreed to become members and, in the case of a company that is to have a share capital, to take at least one share each. It is no longer required to state the name of the company, the type of company (such as public limited company or private company limited by shares), the location of its registered office, the objects of the company, and its authorised share capital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/companyRegistration.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Companies incorporated prior to 1 October 2009 are not required to amend their memorandum. Those details which are now required to appear in the Articles, such as the objects clause and details of the share capital, are deemed to form a part of the Articles.

==Capacities==
The memorandum no longer restricts the activities of a company.  Since 1 October 2009, if a company's constitution contains any restrictions on the objects at all, those restrictions will form part of the articles of association.

Historically, a company's memorandum of association contained an objects clause, which limited its capacity to act. When the first limited companies were incorporated, the objects clause had to be widely drafted so as not to restrict the board of directors in their day to day trading.  In the Companies Act 1989, the term "General Commercial Company" was introduced which meant that companies could undertake "any lawful or legal trade or business."

[[Image:1931 Hawkes Bay Earthquake - Minutes of First Meeting of the Hawkes Bay Earthquake Relief Fund Committee (24631618026).jpg|thumb|Minutes of First Meeting of the Hawkes Bay Earthquake Relief Fund Committee]]
'''Minutes''', also known as '''minutes of meeting''' (abbreviation '''MoM'''), '''protocols''' or, informally, '''notes''', are the instant written record of a [[meeting]] or [[hearing (law)|hearing]]. They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the issues considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the issues.

== Creation ==
Minutes may be created during the meeting by a [[typing|typist]] or [[court reporter]], who may use [[shorthand]] notation and then prepare the minutes and issue them to the participants afterwards. Alternatively, the meeting can be [[Sound recording|audio recorded]], [[Video recording|video recorded]], or a group's appointed or informally assigned [[secretary]] may take notes, with minutes prepared

== Purpose ==
Minutes are the official written record of the meetings of an organization or group. They are not [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcripts]] of those proceedings. Using [[Robert's Rules of Order|''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'']] (RONR), the minutes should contain mainly a record of what was ''done'' at the meeting, not what was ''said'' by the members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert III|2011|p = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization may have its own rules regarding the content of the minutes.

For most organizations or groups, it is important for the minutes to be terse and only include a summary of the decisions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#15|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 15)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-15|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] report (transcript) is typically not useful. Unless the organization's rules require it, a summary of the discussions in a meeting is neither necessary nor appropriate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The minutes of certain groups, such as a [[Corporation|corporate]] [[board of directors]], must be kept on file and are important legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.inc.com/articles/2000/06/19436.html|title = The Importance of Corporate Minutes|date = June 13, 2000|accessdate = 2015-12-16|website = Inc.com|publisher = [[Inc.

==Format==
The format of the minutes can vary depending on the standards established by an organization, although there are general guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nancysylvester.com/docs/Resources/articles/How_to_Write_and_Keep_Meeting_Minutes.html|title = How to Write and Keep Meeting Minutes|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-16|website = |publisher = Nancy Sylvester, MA, PRP, CPP-T|last = Sylvester|first = Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jimslaughter.com/Minutes-Article.cfm|title = Minutes Article|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-16|website = Parliamentarian &amp; Parliamentary Procedure Consultant|publisher = Jim Slaughter|last = Slaughter|first = Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/meeting-minutes-according-to-roberts-rules.html|title = Meeting Minutes According to Robert's Rules|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-16|website = [[For Dummies]]|publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|last = Jennings|first = C. Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' contains a sample set of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 472–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, minutes begin with the name of the body holding the meeting (e.g., a board) and may also include the place, date, list of people present, and the time that the [[Chairman|chair]] called the meeting to order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert III|2011|p = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the primary function of minutes is to record the decisions made, all official decisions must be included. If a formal [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] is proposed and seconded, then (regardless whether it passes) this is recorded.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert III|2011|p = 148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting [[Tally marks|tally]] may also be included.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert III|2011|p = 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of the minutes dealing with a routine motion might note merely that a particular motion was "moved by Ann and passed". It is not strictly necessary to include the name of the person who seconds a motion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Where a tally is included, it is sufficient to record the number of people voting for and against a motion,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; but requests by participants to note their votes by name may be allowed. If a decision is made by [[roll-call vote]], then all of the individual votes are recorded by name.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If it is made by [[general consent]] without a formal vote, then this fact may be recorded.

The minutes may end with a note of the time that the meeting was adjourned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|p = 470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert III|2011|p = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minutes are sometimes submitted by the person who is responsible for them (often the secretary) at a subsequent meeting for review. The traditional closing phrase is  "Respectfully submitted" (although this is no longer common), followed by the officer's signature, his or her typed (or printed) name, and his or her title.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, one of the first items in an [[order of business]] or an [[agenda (meeting)|agenda]] for a meeting is the reading and approval of the minutes from the previous meeting. If the members of the group agree (usually by [[unanimous consent]]) that the written minutes reflect what happened at the previous meeting, then they are approved, and the fact of their approval is recorded in the minutes of the current meeting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#16|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 16)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-15|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are significant errors or omissions, then the minutes may be redrafted and submitted again at a later date. Minor changes may be made immediately using the normal [[Amend (motion)|amendment]] procedures, and the amended minutes may be approved "as amended".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is normally appropriate to send a draft copy of the minutes to all the members in advance of the meeting so that the meeting is not delayed by a reading of the draft.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences''' ('''OEIS'''), also cited simply as '''Sloane's''', is an online database of [[integer sequence]]s. It was created and maintained by [[Neil Sloane]] while a researcher at [[AT&amp;T Labs]]. Foreseeing his retirement from AT&amp;T Labs in 2012 and the need for an independent foundation, Sloane agreed to transfer the [[intellectual property]] and hosting of the OEIS to the '''OEIS Foundation''' in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oeisf.org/index.html#IPXFER Transfer of IP in OEIS to The OEIS Foundation Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sloane continues to be involved in the OEIS in his role as President of the OEIS Foundation.

OEIS records information on integer sequences of interest to both professional [[mathematician]]s and [[recreational mathematics|amateurs]], and is widely cited. {{As of|2018|09|url=https://oeis.org/}} it contains over 300,000 sequences, making it the largest database of its kind.

Each entry contains the leading terms of the sequence, [[Keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s, mathematical motivations, literature links, and more, including the option to generate a [[Graph of a function|graph]] or play a [[Computer music|musical]] representation of the sequence. The database is [[Search engine (computing)|searchable]] by keyword and by [[subsequence]].

==History==
[[Neil Sloane]] started collecting integer sequences as a graduate student in 1965 to support his work in [[combinatorics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Gleick |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/27/science/in-a-random-world-he-collects-patterns.html |title=In a 'random world,' he collects patterns |newspaper=The New York Times |date= January 27, 1987 |page=C1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The database was at first stored on [[punched card]]s. He published selections from the database in book form twice:
#'''''A Handbook of Integer Sequences''''' (1973, {{isbn|0-12-648550-X}}), containing 2,372 sequences in [[Lexicographical order|lexicographic order]] and assigned numbers from 1 to 2372.
#'''''The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences''''' with [[Simon Plouffe]] (1995, {{isbn|0-12-558630-2}}), containing 5,488 sequences and assigned M-numbers from M0000 to M5487.  The Encyclopedia includes the references to the corresponding sequences (which may differ in their few initial terms) in ''A Handbook of Integer Sequences'' as N-numbers from N0001 to N2372 (instead of 1 to 2372.) The Encyclopedia includes the A-numbers that are used in the OEIS, whereas the Handbook did not.
These books were well received and, especially after the second publication, mathematicians supplied Sloane with a steady flow of new sequences. The collection became unmanageable in book form, and when the database had reached 16,000 entries Sloane decided to go online—first as an e-mail service (August 1994), and soon after as a web site (1996). As a spin-off from the database work, Sloane founded the ''[[Journal of Integer Sequences]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/ Journal of Integer Sequences]
 ({{ISSN|1530-7638}})&lt;/ref&gt;
The database continues to grow at a rate of some 10,000 entries a year.
Sloane has personally managed 'his' sequences for almost 40 years, but starting in 2002, a board of associate editors and volunteers has helped maintain the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = //oeis.org/wiki/Editorial_Board | title = Editorial Board | work = On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, Sloane celebrated the addition of the 100,000th sequence to the database, {{OEIS link|A100000}}, which counts the marks on the [[Ishango bone]]. In 2006, the user interface was overhauled and more advanced search capabilities were added. In 2010 an [//oeis.org/wiki/ OEIS wiki] at [//oeis.org/ OEIS.org] was created to simplify the collaboration of the OEIS editors and contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oeisf.org/announcementNov2010.txt | title = New version of OEIS | date = 2010-11-17 | author = Neil Sloane}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 200,000th sequence, {{OEIS link|A200000}}, was added to the database in November 2011; it was initially entered as A200715, and moved to A200000 after a week of discussion on the SeqFan mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://list.seqfan.eu/pipermail/seqfan/2011-November/015853.html|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[seqfan]&lt;/nowiki&gt; A200000|author=Neil J.

== Non-integers ==
Besides integer sequences, the OEIS also catalogs sequences of [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s, the digits of [[transcendental number]]s, [[complex number]]s and so on by transforming them into integer sequences.
Sequences of rationals are represented by two sequences (named with the keyword 'frac'): the sequence of numerators and the sequence of denominators. For example, the fifth order [[Farey sequence]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {1 \over 5}, {1 \over 4}, {1 \over 3}, {2 \over 5}, {1 \over 2}, {3 \over 5}, {2 \over 3}, {3 \over 4}, {4 \over 5}&lt;/math&gt;, is catalogued as the numerator sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4 ({{OEIS link|A006842}}) and the denominator sequence 5, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5 ({{OEIS link|A006843}}).
Important irrational numbers such as π = 3.1415926535897... are catalogued under representative integer sequences such as [[decimal]] expansions (here 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 7, 9, 5, 0, 2, 8, 8, ... ({{OEIS link|A000796}})), [[binary number|binary]] expansions (here 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, ... ({{OEIS link|A004601}})), or [[continued fraction]] expansions (here 3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 84, 2, 1, 1, ... ({{OEIS link|A001203}})).

== Conventions ==
The OEIS was limited to plain [[ASCII]] text until 2011, and it still uses a linear form of conventional mathematical notation (such as ''f''(''n'') for functions, ''n'' for running variables, etc.). [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] are usually represented by their full names, ''e.g.'', mu for μ, phi for φ.
Every sequence is identified by the letter A followed by six digits, almost always referred to with leading zeros, ''e.g.'', A000315 rather than A315.
Individual terms of sequences are separated by commas. Digit groups are not separated by commas, periods, or spaces.
In comments, formulas, etc., &lt;tt&gt;a(n)&lt;/tt&gt; represents the ''n''th term of the sequence.

=== Special meaning of zero ===
Zero is often used to represent non-existent sequence elements. For example, {{OEIS link|A104157}} enumerates the "smallest prime of ''n''² consecutive primes to form an ''n''×''n'' [[magic square]] of least magic constant, or 0 if no such magic square exists." The value of ''a''(1) (a 1×1 magic square) is 2; ''a''(3) is 1480028129. But there is no such 2×2 magic square, so ''a''(2) is 0.
This special usage has a solid mathematical basis in certain counting functions. For example, the [[totient]] valence function ''N''&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'') ({{OEIS link|A014197}}) counts the solutions of φ(''x'') = ''m''. There are 4 solutions for 4, but no solutions for 14, hence ''a''(14) of A014197 is 0—there are no solutions.
Occasionally −1 is used for this purpose instead, as in {{OEIS link|A094076}}.

=== Lexicographical ordering ===
The OEIS maintains the [[lexicographical order]] of the sequences, so each sequence has a predecessor and a successor (its "context").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome: Arrangement of the Sequences in Database|url=https://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Arrangement_of_the_Sequences_in_Database|website=OEIS Wiki|accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; OEIS normalizes the sequences for lexicographical ordering, (usually) ignoring all initial zeros and ones, and also the sign of each element. Sequences of [[weight distribution]] codes often omit periodically recurring zeros.&lt;!-- Unclear, please rephrase. --&gt;

For example, consider: the [[prime number]]s, the [[palindromic prime]]s, the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], the [[lazy caterer's sequence]], and the coefficients in the series expansion of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {{\zeta(n + 2)} \over {\zeta(n)}}&lt;/math&gt;. In OEIS lexicographic order, they are:
* Sequence #1: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, ... {{OEIS link|id=A000040}}
* Sequence #2: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929, ... {{OEIS link|id=A002385}}
* Sequence #3: {{bgcolor|lightpink|0, 1, 1,}} 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, ... {{OEIS link|id=A000045}}
* Sequence #4: {{bgcolor|lightpink|1,}} 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 56, 67, 79, 92, 106, 121, 137, 154, ... {{OEIS link|id=A000124}}
* Sequence #5: {{bgcolor|lightpink|1,}} {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}3, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}8, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}3, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}24, 24, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}48, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}3, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}8, 72, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}120, 24, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}168, 144, ... {{OEIS link|id=A046970}}
whereas unnormalized lexicographic ordering would order these sequences thus: #3, #5, #4, #1, #2.

==Self-referential sequences==&lt;!-- This section is linked from A053873 --&gt;
Very early in the history of the OEIS, sequences defined in terms of the numbering of sequences in the OEIS itself were proposed. "I resisted adding these sequences for a long time, partly out of a desire to maintain the dignity of the database, and partly because A22 was only known to 11 terms!", Sloane reminisced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = N. J. A. | last = Sloane | url = http://public.research.att.com/~njas/doc/sg.pdf | title = My favorite integer sequences | page = 10 | format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the earliest self-referential sequences Sloane accepted into the OEIS was {{OEIS link|A031135}} (later {{OEIS link|A091967}}) "''a''(''n'') = ''n''-th term of sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or -1 if A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has fewer than n terms". This sequence spurred progress on finding more terms of {{OEIS link|A000022}}. 
{{OEIS link|A100544}} lists the first term given in sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but it needs to be updated from time to time because of changing opinions on offsets. Listing instead term ''a''(1) of sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; might seem a good alternative if it weren't for the fact that some sequences have offsets of 2 and greater.
This line of thought leads to the question "Does sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; contain the number ''n'' ?" and the sequences {{OEIS link|A053873}}, "Numbers ''n'' such that OEIS sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; contains ''n''", and {{OEIS link|A053169}}, "''n'' is in this sequence if and only if ''n'' is not in sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;". Thus, the composite number 2808 is in A053873 because {{OEIS link|A002808}} is the sequence of composite numbers, while the non-prime 40 is in A053169 because it's not in {{OEIS link|id=A000040}}, the prime numbers. Each ''n'' is a member of exactly one of these two sequences, and in principle it can be determined ''which'' sequence each ''n'' belongs to, with two exceptions (related to the two sequences themselves):
*It cannot be determined whether 53873 is a member of A053873 or not. If it is in the sequence then by definition it should be; if it is not in the sequence then (again, by definition) it should not be. Nevertheless, either decision would be consistent, and would also resolve the question of whether 53873 is in A053169.
*It can be proved that 53169 [[principle of contradiction|both is and is not]] a member of A053169. If it is in the sequence then by definition it should not be; if it is not in the sequence then (again, by definition) it should be. This is a form of [[Russell's paradox]]. Hence it is also not possible to answer if 53169 is in A053873.

===Entry fields===
; ID number
: Every sequence in the OEIS has a [[serial number]], a six-digit positive integer, prefixed by A (and zero-padded on the left prior to November 2004). The letter "A" stands for "absolute". Numbers are either assigned by the editor(s) or by an A number dispenser, which is handy for when contributors wish to send in related sequences at once and be able to create cross-references. An A number from the dispenser expires a month from issue if not used. But as the following table of arbitrarily selected sequences show, the rough correspondence holds.

: Even for sequences in the book predecessors to the OEIS, the ID numbers are not the same. The 1973 ''Handbook of Integer Sequences'' contained about 2400 sequences, which were numbered by lexicographic order (the letter N plus 4 digits, zero-padded where necessary), and the 1995 ''Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences'' contained 5487 sequences, also numbered by lexicographic order (the letter M plus 4 digits, zero-padded where necessary). These old M and N numbers, as applicable, are contained in the ID number field in parentheses after the modern A number.
; Sequence data
: The sequence field lists the numbers themselves, or at least about four lines' worth. The sequence field makes no distinction between sequences that are finite but still too long to display and sequences that are infinite. To help make that determination, you need to look at the keywords field for "fini", "full", or "more". To determine to which ''n'' the values given correspond, see the offset field, which gives the ''n'' for the first term given.
; Name
: The name field usually contains the most common name for the sequence, and sometimes also the formula. For example, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, ({{OEIS link|A000578}}) is named "The cubes: a(n) = n^3.".
; Comments
: The comments field is for information about the sequence that doesn't quite fit in any of the other fields. The comments field often points out interesting relationships between different sequences and less obvious applications for a sequence. For example, Lekraj Beedassy in a comment to A000578 notes that the cube numbers also count the "total number of triangles resulting from criss-crossing [[Ceva's theorem|cevians]] within a triangle so that two of its sides are each n-partitioned," while Neil Sloane points out the unexpected relationship between centered hexagonal numbers ({{OEIS link|A003215}}) and second Bessel polynomials ({{OEIS link|A001498}}) in a comment to A003215.

; Program
: Originally [[Maple computer algebra system|Maple]] and [[Mathematica]] were the preferred programs for calculating sequences in the OEIS, and they both have their own field labels. {{As of|2016}}, Mathematica was the most popular choice with 100,000 Mathematica programs followed by 50,000 [[PARI/GP]] programs, 35,000 Maple programs, and 45,000 in other languages.
: As for any other part of the record, if there is no name given, the contribution (here: program) was written by the original submitter of the sequence.
; See also
: Sequence cross-references originated by the original submitter are usually denoted by "Cf."
: Except for new sequences, the see also field also includes information on the lexicographic order of the sequence (its "context") and provides links to sequences with close A numbers (A046967, A046968, A046969, A046971, A046972, A046973, in our example).

; Keyword
: The OEIS has its own standard set of mostly four-letter keywords that characterize each sequence:&lt;ref name="terms-explanation"&gt;{{cite web | url = //oeis.org/classic/eishelp2.html | work = On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences | title = Explanation of Terms Used in Reply From}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''base''' The results of the calculation depend on a specific positional base. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181 ... {{OEIS link|A002385}} are prime numbers regardless of base, but they are [[palindromic prime|palindromic]] specifically in base 10. Most of them are not palindromic in binary. Some sequences rate this keyword depending on how they're defined. For example, the [[Mersenne prime]]s 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, ... {{OEIS link|A000668}} does not rate "base" if defined as "primes of the form 2^n - 1". However, defined as "[[repunit]] primes in binary," the sequence would rate the keyword "base".
:* '''bref''' "sequence is too short to do any analysis with", for example, {{OEIS link|A079243}}, Number of isomorphism classes of associative non-commutative non-anti-associative anti-commutative closed binary operations on a set of order n.
:* '''cofr''' The sequence represents a [[continued fraction]], for example, continued fraction expansion of ''e'' ({{OEIS link|A003417}}) or π ({{OEIS link|A001203}}).
:* '''cons''' The sequence is a decimal expansion of a mathematical constant, like ''e'' ({{OEIS link|A001113}}) or π ({{OEIS link|A000796}}).
:* '''core''' A sequence that is of foundational importance to a branch of mathematics, such as the prime numbers ({{OEIS link|A000040}}), the Fibonacci sequence ({{OEIS link|A000045}}), etc.
:* '''dead''' This keyword used for erroneous sequences that have appeared in papers or books, or for duplicates of existing sequences. For example, {{OEIS link|A088552}} is the same as {{OEIS link|A000668}}.
:* '''dumb''' One of the more subjective keywords, for "unimportant sequences," which may or may not directly relate to mathematics. {{OEIS link|A001355}}, "Mix digits of pi and e." is one example of the former, and {{OEIS link|A082390}}, "Numbers on a computer numpad, read in a spiral." is an example of the latter.
:* '''easy''' The terms of the sequence can be easily calculated. Perhaps the sequence most deserving of this keyword is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... {{OEIS link|A000027}}, where each term is 1 more than the previous term. The keyword "easy" is sometimes given to sequences "primes of the form f(m)" where f(m) is an easily calculated function. (Though even if f(m) is easy to calculate for large m, it might be very difficult to determine if f(m) is prime).
:* '''eigen''' A sequence of [[eigenvalue]]s.
:* '''fini''' The sequence is finite, although it might still contain more terms than can be displayed. For example, the sequence field of {{OEIS link|A105417}} shows only about a quarter of all the terms, but a comment notes that the last term is 3888.
:* '''frac''' A sequence of either numerators or denominators of a sequence of fractions representing rational numbers. Any sequence with this keyword ought to be cross-referenced to its matching sequence of numerators or denominators, though this may be dispensed with for sequences of [[Egyptian fraction]]s, such as {{OEIS link|A069257}}, where the sequence of numerators would be {{OEIS link|A000012}}. This keyword should not be used for sequences of continued fractions, cofr should be used instead for that purpose.
:* '''full''' The sequence field displays the complete sequence. If a sequence has the keyword "full", it should also have the keyword "fini". One example of a finite sequence given in full is that of the [[Supersingular prime (moonshine theory)|supersingular prime]]s {{OEIS link|A002267}}, of which there are precisely fifteen.
:* '''hard''' The terms of the sequence cannot be easily calculated, even with raw number crunching power. This keyword is most often used for sequences corresponding to unsolved problems, such as "How many [[n-sphere|''n''-spheres]] can touch another ''n''-sphere of the same size?" {{OEIS link|A001116}} lists the first ten known solutions.
:* '''hear''' A sequence with a graph audio deemed to be "particularly interesting and/or beautiful".
:* '''less''' A "less interesting sequence".
:* '''look''' A sequence with a graph visual deemed to be "particularly interesting and/or beautiful".
:* '''more''' More terms of the sequence are wanted. Readers can submit an extension.
:* '''mult''' The sequence corresponds to a [[multiplicative function]]. Term a(1) should be 1, and term a(mn) can be calculated by multiplying a(m) by a(n) if m and n are coprime. For example, in {{OEIS link|A046970}}, a(12) = a(3)a(4) = -8 × -3.
:* '''new''' For sequences that were added in the last couple of weeks, or had a major extension recently. This keyword is not given a checkbox in the Web form for submitting new sequences, Sloane's program adds it by default where applicable.
:* '''nice''' Perhaps the most subjective keyword of all, for "exceptionally nice sequences."
:* '''nonn''' The sequence consists of nonnegative integers (it may include zeroes). No distinction is made between sequences that consist of nonnegative numbers only because of the chosen offset (e.g., ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the cubes, which are all positive from ''n'' = 0 forwards) and those that by definition are completely nonnegative (e.g., ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the squares).
:* '''obsc''' The sequence is considered obscure and needs a better definition.
:* '''sign''' Some (or all) of the values of the sequence are negative. The entry includes both a Signed field with the signs and a Sequence field consisting of all the values passed through the [[absolute value]] function.
:* '''tabf''' "An irregular (or funny-shaped) array of numbers made into a sequence by reading it row by row." For example, {{OEIS link|A071031}}, "Triangle read by rows giving successive states of cellular automaton generated by "rule 62."
:* '''tabl''' A sequence obtained by reading a geometric arrangement of numbers, such as a triangle or square, row by row. The quintessential example is [[Pascal's triangle]] read by rows, {{OEIS link|A007318}}.
:* '''uned''' The sequence has not been edited but it could be worth including in the OEIS. The sequence may contain computational or typographical errors. Contributors are encouraged to edit these sequences.
:* '''unkn''' "Little is known" about the sequence, not even the formula that produces it. For example, {{OEIS link|A072036}}, which was presented to the [[Internet Oracle]] to ponder.
:* '''walk''' "Counts walks (or self-avoiding paths)."
:* '''word''' Depends on the words of a specific language. For example, zero, one, two, three, four, five, etc. For example, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 6, 6, 8, 8, 7, 7, 9, 8, 8 ... {{OEIS link|A005589}}, "Number of letters in the English name of n, excluding spaces and hyphens."
: Some keywords are mutually exclusive, namely: core and dumb, easy and hard, full and more, less and nice, and nonn and sign.
; Offset
: The offset is the index of the first term given. For some sequences, the offset is obvious. For example, if we list the sequence of square numbers as 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 0; while if we list it as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 1. The default offset is 0, and most sequences in the OEIS have offset of either 0 or 1. Sequence {{OEIS link|A073502}}, the [[magic constant]] for ''n''×''n'' [[magic square]] with prime entries (regarding 1 as a prime) with smallest row sums, is an example of a sequence with offset 3, and {{OEIS link|A072171}}, "Number of stars of visual magnitude ''n''." is an example of a sequence with offset -1. Sometimes there can be disagreement over what the initial terms of the sequence are, and correspondingly what the offset should be. In the case of the [[lazy caterer's sequence]], the maximum number of pieces you can cut a pancake into with ''n'' cuts, the OEIS gives the sequence as 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... {{OEIS link|A000124}}, with offset 0, while [[Mathworld]] gives the sequence as 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... (implied offset 1). It can be argued that making no cuts to the pancake is technically a number of cuts, namely ''n'' = 0. But it can also be argued that an uncut pancake is irrelevant to the problem. Although the offset is a required field, some contributors don't bother to check if the default offset of 0 is appropriate to the sequence they are sending in. The internal format actually shows two numbers for the offset. The first is the number described above, while the second represents the index of the first entry (counting from 1) that has an absolute value greater than 1. This second value is used to speed up the process of searching for a sequence. Thus {{OEIS link|A000001}}, which starts 1, 1, 1, 2 with the first entry representing a(1) has '''1, 4''' as the internal value of the offset field.
; Author(s)
: The author(s) of the sequence is (are) the person(s) who submitted the sequence, even if the sequence has been known since ancient times. The name of the submitter(s) is given first name (spelled out in full), middle initial(s) (if applicable) and last name; this in contrast to the way names are written in the reference fields. The e-mail address of the submitter is also given, with the @ character replaced by "(AT)" with some exceptions such as for associate editors or if an e-mail address does not exist. For most sequences after A055000, the author field also includes the date the submitter sent in the sequence.
; Extension
: Names of people who extended (added more terms to) the sequence, followed by date of extension.

===Sloane's gap===
[[File:Sloanes gap.png|thumb|Plot of Sloane's Gap : number of occurrences (Y log scale) of each integer (X scale) in the OEIS database]]In 2009, the OEIS database was used by an amateur mathematician to measure the "importance" of each integer number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guglielmetti|first1=Philippe|title=Chasse aux nombres acratopèges|url=http://www.drgoulu.com/2008/08/24/nombres-acratopeges|website=Pourquoi Comment Combien}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result shown in the plot on the right shows a clear "gap" between two distinct point clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guglielmetti|first1=Philippe|title=La minéralisation des nombres|url=http://www.drgoulu.com/2009/04/18/nombres-mineralises|website=Pourquoi Comment Combien|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "uninteresting numbers" (blue dots) and the "interesting" numbers that occur comparatively more often in sequences from the OEIS. It contains essentially prime numbers (red), numbers of the form a^n (green) and [[highly composite number]]s (yellow). This phenomenon was studied by Nicolas Gauvrit, [[Jean-Paul Delahaye]] and Hector Zenil who explained the speed of the 2 clouds in terms of algorithmic complexity and the gap by social factors based on an artificial preference for sequences of primes, even numbers, geometric and Fibonacci-type sequences and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Gauvrit|first1=Nicolas|last2=Delahaye|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Zenil|first3=Hector|title=Sloane’s Gap.

{{cite  bailii|litigants='''Paul v Constance'''|year=1976|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=2}} / [1977] 1 W.L.R. 527 is an [[English trust law]] case. It sets out what will be sufficient to establish that someone has intended to create a trust, the first of the "three certainties". It is necessary that a [[settlor]]'s "words and actions ... show a clear intention to dispose of property ... so that someone else acquires a beneficial interest."&lt;ref&gt;''Paul v Constance'' [1977] 1 WLR 527 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Mr Constance’s marriage broke down, and he moved in with Ms Paul. After a workplace accident he received £950 in damages, and following discussions with a bank manager, paid it into a new joint account. They were unmarried, so the account was just put in Mr Constance’s sole name. He said repeatedly, ‘the money is as much yours as mine’. They paid in joint [[Bingo (Commonwealth)|bingo]] winnings too, and they made a £150 withdrawal, which they split. But 13 months after Mr Constance died without a will. Ms Paul claimed the account was hers. Mrs Constance reappeared and claimed the money was hers.

==Judgment==
The Court of Appeal held that the parties' words and conduct demonstrated that he wished for the money to be held on trust for Mr Constance and Ms Paul jointly. [[Leslie Scarman, Baron Scarman|Scarman LJ]] gave the first judgment.

{{quote|we are dealing with ... people, unaware of the subtleties of equity, but understanding very well indeed their own domestic situation. It is right that one should consider the various things that were said and done by the plaintiff and Mr Constance during their time together against their own background and in their own circumstances.

[...]

When one bears in mind the unsophisticated character of the deceased and his relationship with the plaintiff during the last few years or his life, Mr. Wilson submits that the words that he did use on more than one occasion, "This money is as much yours as mine," convey clearly a present declaration that the existing fund was as much the plaintiff’s as his own. The judge accepted that conclusion. I think that he was well justified in doing so and, indeed, I think that he was right to do so. There are, as Mr. Wilson reminded us, other features in the history of the relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased which support the interpretation of those words as an express declaration of trust. I have already described the interview with the bank manager when the account was opened. I have mentioned also the putting of the "bingo" winnings into the account and the one withdrawal for the benefit of both of them.}}

[[Nigel Bridge, Baron Bridge of Harwich|Bridge LJ]] concurred, and quoted ''[[Richards v Delbridge]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1874) 18 Equity Cases 11&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Sir George Jessel MR]] said, "It is true he need not use the words 'I declare myself a trustee,' but he must do something which is equivalent to it, and use expressions which have that meaning, for, however anxious the court may be to carry out a man’s intentions, it is not at liberty to construe words otherwise than according to their proper meaning."

[[David Arnold Scott Cairns|Cairns LJ]] also concurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24718">The '''phony soldiers controversy''' ensued when the media watchdog site Media Matters brought attention to the "phony soldiers" remark made by [[Rush Limbaugh]] during a conversation with a caller on his radio talk show.

In response to Limbaugh's comments, [[United States Senate]] [[United States Senate Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] sent a letter to [[Mark P.

==Overview==
===Lead up===
On September 21, 2007, the [[Associated Press]] released a story in which Doug Carver from the Office of the Inspector General of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] called individuals who never served in the military and attempted to defraud the government of veteran benefits "Phony War Heroes":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The '''phony war hero''' phenomenon ... tarnishes the service of thousands of veterans who have served honorably," -- Doug Carver&lt;ref name="phonysoldierscost"&gt;{{cite news

The story was about [[Jesse Macbeth]], who claimed at the onset of the [[Iraq War]] that he had witnessed attacks on [[Arabs]] in [[mosque]]s and abuses of civilians. In reality, he did not graduate from [[US Army|Army]] boot camp. He was also receiving veteran benefits after he made those claims. MacBeth was eventually sentenced to 5 months in prison.

On September 24, the [[ABC News]] program ''[[World News with Charles Gibson]]'' ran a segment on "phony heroes". The show's opening stated that "A famous recruiting slogan once touted the Army as a place to be all you can be. But increasingly, scam artists are posing as the war heroes they never were, claiming credit for acts of courage in Iraq and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===September 26 broadcast transcript===
On the September 26 radio broadcast of ''The Rush Limbaugh Show'', Limbaugh took a call from two listeners. The first, a man who claimed to be a Republican and former member of the military, expressed a desire for the US to withdraw from Iraq. The second, responding to the first caller, complained that the media never talked to "real soldiers".&lt;ref name="radiotranscript"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the caller saying "They pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and spout to the media", Limbaugh said "the phony soldiers". After the conversation, Limbaugh read aloud the Associated Press article about MacBeth.

The unedited transcript of the conversation is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thanks for taking my call.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LIMBAUGH: You bet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CALLER: I have a retort to Mike in Chicago, because I am serving in the American military, in the Army. I've been serving for 14 years, very proudly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LIMBAUGH: Thank you, sir.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CALLER: I'm one of the few that joined the Army to serve my country, I'm proud to say, not for the money or anything like that. What I would like to retort to is that, what these people don't understand, is if we pull out of Iraq right now, which is not possible because of all the stuff that's over there, it would take us at least a year to pull everything back out of Iraq, then Iraq itself would collapse and we'd have to go right back over there within a year or so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LIMBAUGH: There's a lot more than that that they don't understand. The next guy that calls here I'm going to ask them, "What is the imperative of pulling out? What's in it for the United States to pull out?" I don't think they have an answer for that other than, "When's he going to bring the troops home? Keep the troops safe," whatever.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;CALLER: Yeah.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LIMBAUGH: It's not possible intellectually to follow these people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CALLER: No, it's not. And what's really funny is they never talk to real soldiers. They pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and spout to the media.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LIMBAUGH: The phony soldiers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CALLER: Phony soldiers. If you talk to any real soldier and they're proud to serve, they want to be over in Iraq, they understand their sacrifice and they're willing to sacrifice for the country.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LIMBAUGH: They joined to be in Iraq.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CALLER: A lot of people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LIMBAUGH: You know where you're going these days, the last four years, if you sign up. The odds are you're going there or [[Afghanistan]], or somewhere.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CALLER: Exactly, sir. My other comment, my original comment, was a retort to Jill about the fact we didn't find any weapons of mass destruction. Actually, we have found weapons of mass destruction in chemical agents that terrorists have been using against us for a while now. I've done two tours in Iraq, I just got back in June, and there are many instances of insurgents not knowing what they're using in their [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. They're using mustard artillery rounds, VX artillery rounds in their IEDs. Because they didn't know what they were using, they didn't do it right, and so it didn't really hurt anybody. But those munitions are over there. It's a huge desert. If they bury it somewhere, we're never going to find it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LIMBAUGH: Well, that's a moot point for me right now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CALLER: Right. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LIMBAUGH: The weapons of mass destruction. We gotta get beyond that. We're there. We all know they were there, and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Mahmoud]] even admitted it in one of his speeches here talking about Saddam using the poison mustard gas or whatever it is on his own people. But that's moot. What's more important is all this is taking place now in the midst of the surge working, and all of these anti-war Democrats are getting even more hell-bent on pulling out of there, which means that success on the part of you and your colleagues over there is a great threat to them. It's frustrating and maddening, and why they must be kept in the minority. I want to thank you, Mike, for calling. I appreciate it very much.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here is a Morning Update that we did recently, talking about fake soldiers. This is a story of who the left props up as heroes. They have their celebrities and one of them was Army Ranger Jesse Macbeth. Now, he was a "corporal." I say in quotes. Twenty-three years old. What made Jesse Macbeth a hero to the anti-war crowd wasn't his [[Purple Heart]]; it wasn't his being affiliated with post-traumatic stress disorder from tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. No. What made Jesse Macbeth, Army Ranger, a hero to the left was his courage, in their view, off the battlefield, without regard to consequences. He told the world the abuses he had witnessed in Iraq, American soldiers killing unarmed civilians, hundreds of men, women, even children. In one gruesome account, translated into Arabic and spread widely across the Internet, Army Ranger Jesse Macbeth describes the horrors this way: "We would burn their bodies. We would hang their bodies from the rafters in the mosque."

Now, recently, Jesse Macbeth, poster boy for the anti-war left, had his day in court. And you know what? He was sentenced to five months in jail and three years probation for falsifying a Department of Veterans Affairs claim and his Army discharge record. He was in the Army. Jesse Macbeth was in the Army, folks, briefly. Forty-four days before he washed out of boot camp. Jesse Macbeth isn't an Army Ranger, never was. He isn't a corporal, never was. He never won the [[Purple Heart]], and he was never in combat to witness the horrors he claimed to have seen. You probably haven't even heard about this. And, if you have, you haven't heard much about it. This doesn't fit the narrative and the template in the Drive-By Media and the Democrat Party as to who is a genuine war hero. Don't look for any retractions, by the way. Not from the anti-war left, the anti-military Drive-By Media, or the Arabic websites that spread Jesse Macbeth's lies about our troops, because the truth for the left is fiction that serves their purpose. They have to lie about such atrocities because they can't find any that fit the template of the way they see the US military. In other words, for the American anti-war left, the greatest inconvenience they face is the truth.&lt;ref name="radiotranscript"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 28 Limbaugh published an edited audio and transcript versions of the September 26th exchange. Deleted from what he called the "entire transcript" was a one minute 35 seconds exchange. Limbaugh provided, according to Media Matters, no "notation or ellipsis to indicate that there is, in fact, a break in the transcript of the September 26 clip he used." Media Matters referred to the edits as being employed "selectively" in an attempt to "recast" the controversy while he "misrepresented" his comments.

touching off a series of rebukes from [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] demanding that Limbaugh apologize. [[John Kerry]] called Limbaugh's comment "a disgusting attack", and stated, "In a single moment on his show, Limbaugh managed to question the patriotism of men and women in uniform who have put their lives on the line and many who died for his right to sit safely in his air-conditioned studio peddling hate."&lt;ref name="jkerry"&gt;{{cite news

The Senate rebuke drew criticism from Congressional Republicans like Congressman [[Doug Lamborn]] of Colorado who said on the floor of the House of Representatives, "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the liberals' fraudulent attacks on Rush Limbaugh. Anyone who reads the widely available transcript, as I have done, sees that Mr. Limbaugh was appropriately referring to the pretenders who pose as medal winners, or who falsely claim to have committed atrocities in Iraq, when he used the phrase "phony soldiers." No, the real scandal here is that liberals in America and here in this Congress are willing to manipulate facts to smear those they disagree with. But there’s an even more insidious agenda by liberals going on, and that is to reinstitute the so-called [[Fairness Doctrine]], which is actually a way to silence conservatives on the radio waves. Mr. Limbaugh deserves mega kudos for being a forceful and effective voice on the side of common sense and for being an example of the First Amendment in action. After all, isn’t that what our country is supposed to be about?"&lt;ref name="dplamborn"&gt;{{cite news

In the days that followed Limbaugh stated on his radio program that when he referred to "phony soldiers" he was specifically referring to [[Jesse MacBeth]], whom he mentioned by name in the dialogue of his show, and those who never actually served.&lt;ref name="radiotranscript"&gt;{{cite web

===Composition===
On October 2, 2007, Harry Reid authored a two-page letter to [[Mark Mays]], CEO of Clear Channel Communications (the radio company which broadcasts the Rush Limbaugh show) requesting that he "publicly repudiate these comments and ask Mr. Limbaugh to apologize."&lt;ref name="reidletter"&gt;{{cite web
 | last =Reid

 | url =http://download.premiereradio.net/guest/rushlimb/pdf/RushLimbaughSmearLetter.pdf
 | format =PDF
 | accessdate = 2007-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty-one U.S. Senators, all of the Democratic Party, signed the letter, four of whom were running for the Democratic nomination for President: [[Joe Biden]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Chris Dodd]], and [[Barack Obama]]. The other signatories are [[Harry Reid]], [[Blanche Lincoln]], [[Dick Durbin|Richard Durbin]], [[Kent Conrad]], [[Bob Menendez]], [[Charles Schumer]], [[Barbara Mikulski]], [[Patty Murray]], [[Byron Dorgan]], [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]], [[Daniel Akaka]], [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[Max Baucus]], [[Tom Harkin]], [[Jack Reed (politician)|Jack Reed]], [[Daniel Inouye]], [[Jay Rockefeller]], [[Barbara Boxer]], [[Edward M. Kennedy]], [[Ken Salazar]], [[Sherrod Brown]], [[John Kerry]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Robert Byrd]], [[Amy Klobuchar]], [[Debbie Stabenow]], [[Benjamin Cardin]], [[Mary Landrieu]], [[Jon Tester]], [[Tom Carper]], [[Frank Lautenberg]], [[Jim Webb]], [[Robert P. Casey, Jr.|Bob Casey]], [[Patrick Leahy]], [[Sheldon Whitehouse]], [[Carl Levin]], and [[Ron Wyden]].

===Clear Channel response===
On October 2, 2007, Mark Mays sent a reply to Senator Reid stating, "I have carefully read the transcript from the episode in question. I hope you will appreciate that I can not speak with authority to whom exactly Mr. Limbaugh's comments were directed or what was his intent. Only Mr. Limbaugh can speak to those issues, which he has done." Mays goes on to explain to the Senate Majority leader that, "The first Amendment gives every American the right to voice his or her opinion, no matter how unpopular. That right is one I am sure you agree must be cherished and protected."&lt;ref name="maysletter"&gt;{{cite web

 | format =PDF
 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mays then turned the Reid letter over to Rush Limbaugh.

===Auction===
On October 11, 2007, on his "Rush to Excellence" tour in [[Philadelphia]], he announced that he would be putting the letter on eBay the following day to sell to the highest bidder, the resulting revenue to be turned over to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation, a charity which provides scholarships and assistance to the children of servicemen and police officers killed in the line of duty and an organization for which Limbaugh is a Director and one of the chief fundraisers.

On October 19, 2007, the letter sold for a record $2,100,100 to [[Betty Casey]], Director of the Eugene B. Casey Foundation. Limbaugh matched the donation with his own money bringing the total donation to the Foundation to $4,200,200. Betty Casey remarked, "The Eugene B. Casey Foundation believes freedom of speech is a basic right of every citizen of this country. Their purchase of the smear letter was to demonstrate their belief in this right and to support Rush Limbaugh, his views and his continued education of us."&lt;ref name="foxauction"&gt;{{cite web

===Conclusion===
Within an hour of the record-setting auction closing, Senator Reid addressed the issue again on the floor of the Senate stating, "I strongly believe when we can put our differences aside, even Harry Reid and Rush Limbaugh, we should do that and try to accomplish good things for the American people."&lt;ref name="globeauction"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferraro |first=Thomas |title=Reid-Limbaugh spat raises $2.1 million for children |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=2007-10-19 |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2007/10/19/reid_limbaugh_spat_raises_21_million_for_children/ |accessdate=2007-10-22 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polonization''' (or '''Polonisation'''; {{lang-pl|polonizacja}})&lt;ref name="Polszczenie"&gt;In Polish historiography, particularly pre-WWII (e.g., L. Wasilewski. As noted in Смалянчук А. Ф. (Smalyanchuk 2001) Паміж краёвасцю і нацыянальнай ідэяй. Польскі рух на беларускіх і літоўскіх землях. 1864–1917 г. / Пад рэд. С. Куль-Сяльверставай. – Гродна: ГрДУ, 2001. – 322 с. {{ISBN|978-5-94716-036-9}} (2004). Pp.24, 28.), an additional distinction between the Polonization ({{lang-pl|polonizacja}}) and self-Polonization ({{lang-pl|polszczenie się}}) has been being made, however, most modern Polish researchers don't use the term ''polszczenie się''.&lt;/ref&gt; was the acquisition or imposition of elements of [[Polish culture]], in particular the [[Polish language]]. This was experienced in some historic periods by the non-Polish populations of territories controlled or substantially under the influence of [[Poland]]. As with other examples of [[cultural assimilation]], it could either be voluntary or forced and is most visible in the case of territories where the Polish language or culture were dominant or where their adoption could result in increased prestige or social status, as was the case of the [[nobility]] of [[Ruthenia]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. To a certain extent Polonization was also administratively promoted by the authorities, particularly in the [[People's Republic of Poland|period following World War II]].

==Summary==
Polonization can be seen as an example of cultural assimilation. Such a view is widely considered applicable to the times of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569–1795) when the [[Ruthenian nobility|Ruthenian]] and [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuanian]] upper classes were drawn towards the more [[Western culture|Westernized]] Polish culture and the political and financial benefits of such a transition, as well as, sometimes, by the administrative pressure exerted on their own cultural institutions, primarily the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. The conversion to the Roman Catholic (and to a lesser extent, Protestant) faith was often the single most important part of the process. For Ruthenians of that time, being Polish culturally and Roman Catholic by religion was almost the same. This aspect of Polonization that led to the diminishing of the Orthodox Church was the part that was most resented by the Belarusian and Ukrainian masses. In contrast the Lithuanians, who were mostly Catholic, were in danger of losing their cultural identity as a nation, but that did not become evident for the wide masses of Lithuanians until the [[Lithuanian National Revival|Lithuanian national renaissance]] in the middle of the 19th century.

On the other hand, the Polonization policies of the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish government]] in the interwar years of the 20th century were again two-folded. Some of them were similar to the mostly forcible [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilationist]] policies, implemented by other European powers that have aspired to regional dominance (e.g., [[Germanization]], [[Russification]]), while others resembled policies carried out by countries aiming at increasing the role of their native language and culture in their own societies (e.g., [[Magyarization]], [[Rumanization]], [[Ukrainization]]). For Poles, it was a process of rebuilding Polish national identity and reclaiming Polish heritage, including the fields of education, religion, infrastructure and administration, that suffered under the prolonged periods of [[partitions of Poland|foreign occupation by the neighboring empires]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Prussia]], and [[Austria-Hungary]]. However, as a third of recreated Poland's population was ethnically non-Polish and many felt their own nationhood aspirations thwarted specifically by Poland, large segments of this population resisted to varying extents the policies intended to assimilate them. [[Endecja|Part of the country's leadership]] emphasized the need for the ethnic and cultural homogeneity of the state in the long term. However, the promotion of the Polish language in the administration, public life and, especially education, were perceived by some as an attempt at forcible homogenization. In areas inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians for example, actions of the Polish authorities seen as aiming at restricting the influence of the Orthodox and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] caused additional resentment, and were considered to be closely tied to religious Polonization.

Between the 12th and the 14th centuries many towns in [[Polish Crown|Poland]] adopted the so-called [[Magdeburg rights]] that promoted the towns' development and [[trade (profession)|trade]]. The rights were usually granted by the king on the occasion of the arrival of migrants. Some, integrated with the larger community, such as merchants who settled there, especially [[Greeks]] and [[Armenians]]. They adopted most aspects of Polish culture but kept their Orthodox faith. Since the Middle Ages, Polish culture, influenced by the West, in turn radiated East, beginning the long and uneasy process of [[cultural assimilation]].&lt;ref name="Mikos2"&gt;[[Michael J.

The Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Jogaila]] was offered the Polish crown and became [[Jogaila|Władysław II Jagiełło]] (reigned 1386–1434). This marked the beginning of the gradual, voluntary Polonization of the Lithuanian nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lane. ''Lithuania stepping westwards''.

The Ruthenian nobility was also freed from many payment obligations and their rights were equalized with those of the Polish nobility.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Under Jogaila successor as a king of Crown [[Władysław III of Poland|Władysław III of Varna]], who reigned in 1434–1444, Polonization attained a certain degree of subtlety.&lt;!-- original research removed --&gt; Władysław III introduced some liberal reforms. He expanded the privileges to all Ruthenian nobles irrespective of their religion, and in 1443 signed a bull equalizing the Orthodox church in rights with the Roman Catholicism thus alleviating the relationship with the Orthodox clergy. These policies continued under the next king [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]]. Still, the mostly cultural expansion of the Polish influence continued since the Ruthenian nobility were attracted by both the glamour of the Western culture and the Polish political order where the [[magnates]] became the unrestricted rulers of the lands and serfs in their vast estates.&lt;ref&gt;Ulčinaitė E., Jovaišas A., [https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081117/http://ualgiman.dtiltas.lt/vid..html#Hermanas_Vartbergietis_ "Lietuvių kalba ir literatūros istorija."

Some Ruthenian magnates like [[Sanguszko]], [[Wiśniowiecki]] and Kisiel, resisted the cultural Polonization for several generations, with the [[Ostrogski]] family being one of the most prominent examples. Remaining generally loyal to the Polish state, the magnates, like Ostrogskis, stood by the religion of their forefathers, and supported the Orthodox Church generously by opening schools, printing books in Ruthenian language (the first four printed [[Cyrillic]] books in the world were published in Cracow, in 1491&lt;ref name="Mikos"&gt;[[Michael J. Mikoś]], ''Polish Renaissance Literature: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael J. Mikoś.

However, their resistance was gradually waning with each subsequent generation as more and more of the Ruthenian elite turned towards Polish language and Catholicism. Still, with most of the educational system getting Polonized and the most generously funded institutions being to the west of Ruthenia, the Ruthenian indigenous culture further deteriorated. In the Polish Ruthenia the language of the administrative paperwork started to gradually shift towards Polish. By the 16th century the language of administrative paperwork in Ruthenia was a peculiar mix of the older [[Church Slavonic]] with the [[Ruthenian language]] of the commoners and the [[Polish language]]. With the Polish influence in the mix gradually increasing it soon became mostly like the Polish language superimposed on the Ruthenian phonetics. The total confluence of Ruthenia and Poland was seen coming.&lt;ref name=KostKhmeln/&gt;

As the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] [[Greek-Catholic]] Church originally created to accommodate the Ruthenian, initially Orthodox, nobility, ended up unnecessary to them as they converted directly into the [[Latin Rite]] Catholicism en masse, the Church largely became an hierarchy without followers. The Greek Catholic Church was then used as a tool aimed to split even the peasantry from their Ruthenian roots, still mostly unsuccessfully.&lt;ref name="EB_Unia"/&gt; The commoners, deprived of their native protectors, sought protection through the [[Cossacks]],&lt;ref name="EB_Unia"/&gt; who, being fiercely Orthodox, tended also to easily turn to violence against those they perceived as their enemies, particularly the Polish state and what they saw as its representatives, the Poles and generally the [[Catholic]]s, as well as the Jews.&lt;ref name=KostKhmeln&gt;"[[Nikolay Kostomarov]], ''[http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom36.htm Russian History in Biographies of its main figures.]'' "Little Russian Hetman Zinoviy-Bogdan Khmelnytsky." {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polonization took place in the early years of the [[Prussia]]n partition, where, as a reaction to the persecution of Roman Catholicism during the [[Kulturkampf]], German Catholics living in areas with a Polish majority voluntarily integrated themselves within Polish society, affecting approximately 100,000 Germans in the eastern provinces of Prussia.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

According to some scholars{{Who|date=June 2011}} the biggest successes in Polonization of the non-Polish lands of former Commonwealth were achieved after the Partitions, in times of persecution of Polishness (noted by [[Leon Wasilewski]] (1917&lt;ref&gt;Wasilewski L. (Wasilewski 1917) Kresy Wschodnie. – Warszawa: T-wo wydawnicze w Warszawie, 1917. p. VII as cited in (Smalyanchuk 2001), p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky]] (1926&lt;ref&gt;(Dovnar 1926) pp.290–291,298.&lt;/ref&gt;)). Paradoxically, the substantial eastward movement of the Polish ethnic territory (over these lands) and growth of the Polish ethnic regions were taking place exactly in the period of the strongest Russian attack on everything Polish in Lithuania and Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;"In times of Myravyov the Hanger", as noted in (Wasilewski 1917), p. VII as cited in (Smalyanchuk 2001), p.24. See also the note on treatment of Polonisation as self-Polonisation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general outline of causes for that is considered to include the activities of the [[Roman-Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;As noted in (Wasilewski 1917), p.42 as cited in (Smalyanchuk 2001), p.24. Also noted by Halina Turska in 1930s in "O powstaniu polskich obszarów językowych na Wileńszczyźnie", p.487 as cited in (Smalyanchuk 2001), p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the cultural influence exacted by the big cities ([[Vilna]], [[Kovno]]) on these lands,&lt;ref&gt;As noted in (Wasilewski 1917), p.42 as cited in (Smalyanchuk 2001), p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; the activities of the Vilna educational district in 19th century–1820s,&lt;ref&gt;(Dovnar 1926) pp.290–291,293–298.&lt;/ref&gt; the activities of the local administration, still controlled by the local Polish or already Polonized nobility up to the 1863–1864 [[January Uprising|January uprising]],&lt;ref name="Smal-28-Dov-26"&gt;(Smalyanchuk 2001), p.28, (Dovnar 1926), pp.303–315,319–320,328–331,388–389.&lt;/ref&gt; secret (Polish) schools in second half nineteenth to the beginning of the 20th century (''tajne komplety'')&lt;ref name="Smal-28-Dov-26" /&gt; and the influence of the land estates.&lt;ref name="Smal-28-Dov-26" /&gt;

Following the [[Partitions of Poland|demise of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the end of the 18th century, the Polonization trends initially continued in Lithuania, Belarus and Polish-dominated parts of Ukraine as the initially liberal policies of the Empire gave the Polish elite significant concessions in the local affairs. Dovnar-Zapolsky notes&lt;ref name="Dovnar"&gt;Довнар-Запольский М. В. ([[Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky]]) История Белоруссии. – 2-е изд. – Мн.: Беларусь, 2005. – 680 с. {{ISBN|985-01-0550-X}}, {{LCCN|2003500047}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Polonization actually intensified under the liberal rule{{citation needed|date=August 2007}} of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], particularly due to the efforts of Polish intellectuals who led the [[Vilnius University]] which was organized in 1802–1803 from the Academy in Vilna (''Schola Princeps Vilnensis''), vastly expanded and given the highest ''Imperial'' status under the new name [[Vilnius University|Vilna Imperial University]] (''Imperatoria Universitas Vilnensis'').&lt;ref name=Venc /&gt; By the Emperor's order, the Vilna education district overseen by [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski|Adam Czartoryski]], a personal friend of Alexander, was greatly expanded to include the vast territories in the West of the [[Russian Empire]] stretching to Kiev in south-east and much of the Polish territory and the development of the University, which had no rival in the whole district, received the highest priority of the Imperial authorities which granted it significant freedom and autonomy.&lt;ref name=Venc&gt;[[Tomas Venclova]], [http://www.lituanus.org/1981_2/81_2_01.htm Four Centuries of Enlightenment. A Historic View of the University of Vilnius, 1579–1979], ''Lituanus'', Volume 27, No.1 – Summer 1981&lt;/ref&gt; With the effort of Polish intellectuals who served the [[Rector (academia)|rectors]] of the University, Hieronim Strojnowski, [[Jan Śniadecki]], Szymon Malewski, as well as Czartoryski who oversaw them, the University became the center of Polish patriotism and culture; and as the only University of the district the center attracted the young nobility of all ethnicities from this extensive region.&lt;ref name=Venc /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yla&gt;Rev. Stasys Yla, [http://www.lituanus.org/1981_2/81_2_03.htm The Clash of Nationalities at the University of Vilnius], ''Lituanus'', Volume 27, No.1 – Summer 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

With time, the traditional [[Latin]] was fully eliminated from the University and by 1816 it was fully replaced by Polish and Russian. This change both affected and reflected a profound change in the Belarusian and Lithuanian secondary schools systems where Latin was also traditionally used as the University was the main source of the teachers for these schools. Additionally, the University was responsible for the textbooks selection and only Polish textbooks were approved for printing and usage.&lt;ref name=Yla /&gt;

Dovnar-Zapolsky notes that "the 1800s–1810s had seen the unprecedented prosperity of the Polish culture and language in the former Great Duchy of Lithuania lands" and "this era has seen the effective completion of the Polonization of the smallest nobility, with further reduction of the areal of use of the contemporary [[Belarusian language]].&lt;ref name=Dovnar290&gt;Dovnar-Zapolsky, pp.290–298.&lt;/ref&gt; also noting that the Polonization trend had been complemented with the (covert) anti-Russian and [[anti-Eastern Orthodox]] trends.&lt;ref name="Dovnar_p293"&gt;Dovnar-Zapolsky, pp.293–296.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of these trends are best reflected in the [[Ethnic history of the region of Vilnius|ethnic censuses]] in previously non-Polish territories.

Following the Polish [[November uprising]] aimed at breaking away from Russia, the Imperial policies finally changed abruptly. The University was forcibly closed in 1832 and the following years where characterized by the policies aimed at the assimilationist solution of the "Polish question", a trend that was further strengthened following another unsuccessful [[January Uprising|uprising]] (1863).{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the 19th century, the mostly unchallenged Polonization trend of the previous centuries had been met staunchly by then "[[anti-Polish]]" [[Russification]] policy, with temporary successes on both sides, like Polonization rises in mid-1850s and in 1880s and Russification strengthenings in 1830s and in 1860s.&lt;ref name="Dovnar_p303"&gt;Dovnar-Zapolsky, pp.303–315,319–320,328–331.&lt;/ref&gt; Any Polonization of the east and west territories (Russian and German partitions) occurred in the situation were Poles had steadily diminishing influence on the government. Partition of Poland posed a genuine threat to the continuation of Polish language-culture in those regions.&lt;ref name="Suss_Cubb" /&gt; As Polonization was centered around Polish culture, policies aimed at weakening and destroying it had a significant impact on weakening Polonization of those regions. This was particularly visible in Russian-occupied Poland, where the Polish culture fared worst, as Russian administration gradually became strongly [[anti-Polish]].&lt;ref name="Suss_Cubb" /&gt; After a brief and relatively liberal early period in the early 19th century, where Poland was allowed to retain some autonomy as the [[Congress Poland]] [[puppet state]],&lt;ref name="Harold Nicolson"&gt;[[Harold Nicolson]], ''The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity: 1812–1822 '', Grove Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8021-3744-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN080213744X&amp;id=qm5BNjqrGsUC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Congress+Poland+puppet&amp;sig=QeOuv98IrRQBMjDxV-SSShnqHlY Google Print, p.171]&lt;/ref&gt; the situation for Polish culture steadily worsened.

The issue of non-Polish minorities was a subject of intense debate within the Polish leadership. Two ideas of Polish policy clashed at the time: a more tolerant and less assimilationist approach advocated by [[Józef Piłsudski]],&lt;ref name="Brzez"&gt;[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in his introduction to Wacław Jędrzejewicz's "Pilsudski A Life For Poland" wrote: ''Pilsudski’s vision of Poland, paradoxically, was never attained. He contributed immensely to the creation of a modern Polish state, to the preservation of Poland from the Soviet invasion, yet he failed to create the kind of multinational commonwealth, based on principles of social justice and ethnic tolerance, to which he aspired in his youth. One may wonder how relevant was his image of such a Poland in the age of nationalism...''. Quoted from [http://members.lycos.co.uk/jozefpilsudski/index2.html members.lycos.co.uk].&lt;/ref&gt; and an assimilationist approach advocated by [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[Stanisław Grabski]].

Linguistic assimilation was considered by [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] to be a major factor for "unifying the state." For example, Grabski as Polish Minister for Religion and Public Education in 1923 and 1925–1926, wrote that "Poland may be preserved only as a state of Polish people. If it were a state of Poles, Jews, Germans, Rusyns, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Russians, it would lose its independence again"; and that "it is impossible to make a nation out of those who have no 'national self-identification,' who call themselves 'local' (''[[tutejszy]]'')."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Grabski also said that "the transformation of the state territory of the Republic into a Polish national territory is a necessary condition of maintaining our frontiers."&lt;ref name="Brub"&gt;Quoted in: [[Rogers Brubaker]], ''Nationalism Reframed: Nationhood and the National Question in the New Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-57649-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521576490&amp;id=O3Bfhfghi50C&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=stanislaw+grabski&amp;sig=pVgdkDsk1AeiVqF-Rl8QhQ_Pddw Google Print, p.100].&lt;/ref&gt;

In internal politics, Piłsudski's reign marked a much-needed stabilization and improvement in the situation of [[ethnic minorities]], which formed almost a third of the population of the Second Republic. Piłsudski replaced the [[National Democracy|National-Democratic]] "ethnic-assimilation" with a "state-assimilation" policy: citizens were judged by their loyalty to the state, not by their ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt; The years 1926–1935 were favourably viewed by many [[Polish Jews]], whose situation improved especially under the cabinet of Piłsudski's appointee [[Kazimierz Bartel]].&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"&gt;Feigue Cieplinski, ''Poles and Jews: The Quest For Self-Determination 1919–1934'', Binghamton Journal of History, Fall 2002, Last accessed on 2 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However a combination of various reasons, from the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt; through the Piłsudski's need for support from parties for the parliament's election&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt; to the [[vicious spiral]] of terrorist attacks by [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] and government pacifications&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies_GP2-407"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0231053525&amp;id=DMoPXktGwiUC&amp;pg=PA407&amp;lpg=PA407&amp;dq=Davies+OUN+terrorism&amp;sig=n2yftCtdccp3U4rPQL8OcBtH9_8 Davies, God's Playground, op.cit.]&lt;/ref&gt; meant that the situation continued to degenerate, despite Piłsudski's efforts.

However, Polonization also created a new educated class among the non-Polish minorities, a class of intellectuals aware of the importance of schooling, press, literature and theatre, who became instrumental in the development of their own ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenia Prokop-Janiec, "Polskie dziedzictwo kulturowe w nowej Europie.

The territories of [[Western Belarus]], western [[Ukraine]] and the [[Vilnius region]], were incorporated into interwar Poland in 1921 at the [[Treaty of Riga]] in which the Polish eastern frontiers had been first defined following the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919–1921.

The Treaty of Riga signed between sovereign Poland and the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] representing the [[Soviet Ukraine]] without any participation from Belarusian side assigned almost half of the modern-day [[Belarus]] (the western half of [[Soviet Belarus]]) to the [[Polish Second Republic]].

The Belarusian civil society resisted polonization and mass closure of Belarusian schools. The Belarusian Schools Society ({{lang-be|Таварыства беларускай школы}}), led by [[Branisłaŭ Taraškievič]] and other activists, was the main organization promoting education in Belarusian language in West Belarus in 1921–1937.

=====Resistance to polonization in West Belarus=====
Compared to the (larger) [[Ukrainian minority in Poland|Ukrainian minority]] living in Poland, Belarusians were much less politically aware and active. Nevertheless, according to Belarusian historians, the policies by the Polish government against the population of West Belarus increasingly provoked protests&lt;ref name=BarGU/&gt; and armed resistance. In the 1920s, Belarusian partisan units arose in many areas of West Belarus, mostly unorganized but sometimes led by activists of Belarusian left wing parties.&lt;ref name=BarGU/&gt; In the spring of 1922, several thousands Belarusian [[partisan (military)|partisans]] issued a demand to the Polish government to stop the violence, to liberate [[political prisoners]] and to grant autonomy to West Belarus.&lt;ref name=BarGU/&gt; Protests were held in various regions of West Belarus until mid 1930s.&lt;ref name=BarGU/&gt;

The largest Belarusian political organization, the ''[[Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union]]'' (or, the Hramada), which demanded a stop to the polonization and autonomy for West Belarus, grew more radicalized by the time. It received logistical help from the Soviet Union,&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"&gt;{vn|August 2016}{{cite web |url=http://kresy24.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Glos_znad_Niemna_7-2011.pdf |title=Białostocki ulubieniec Stalina |publisher=Głos znad Niemna (Voice of the Neman weekly), Nr 7 (60) |work=Ogólnokrajowy tygodnik SZ "Związek Polaków na Białorusi" (Association of Poles of Belarus) |date=June 2011 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |author=Andrzej Poczobut, Joanna Klimowicz |format=PDF file, direct download 1.79 MB |pages=6–7 of current document}} &lt;!-- kresy24 is an irredentist nationalist website, hardly a credible source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and financial aid from the [[Comintern]].&lt;ref name="Savchenko"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmld75blKCwC&amp;q=%22stated+goals+of+the+Hramada%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22stated%20goals%20of%20the%20Hramada%22&amp;f=false |title=Belarus: A Perpetual Borderland |publisher=BRILL |author=Dr Andrew Savchenko |year=2009 |pages=106–107 |isbn=9004174486}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927 ''Hramada''  was controlled entirely by agents from Moscow.&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt; It was banned by the Polish authorities,&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt; and further opposition to the Polish government was met with state-imposed sanctions once the connection between ''Hramada'' and the more radical pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Western Belarus]] was discovered.&lt;ref name="kresy24.pl"/&gt; The Polish policy was met with armed resistance.&lt;ref name="EtnoDictionary"&gt;''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires''.

Territories of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]] had different backgrounds, different recent histories and different dominant religions. Until the First World War, Galicia with its large Ukrainian [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] population in the east (around Lwów), and Polish [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] in the west (around Kraków), was controlled by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt; On the other hand, the Ukrainians of Volhynia, formerly of the [[Russian Empire]] (around Równe), were largely [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox by religion]], and were influenced by strong [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophile]] trends.&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt; Both "Polish officials and Ukrainian activists alike, distinguished between Galician and Volhynian Ukrainians" in their political aims.&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt; There was a much stronger national self-perception among the Galician Ukrainians increasingly influenced by OUN (Ukrainian nationalists).

===== Religion =====
{{See also|Recovery of Orthodox Churches in the Second Polish Republic}}
While the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] (UGCC), which functioned in [[Full communion|communion]] with the [[Latin Rite]] Catholicism, could have hoped to receive a better treatment in Poland where the leadership saw Catholicism as one of the main tools to unify the nation – the Poles under [[Stanisław Grabski]] saw the restless Galician Ukrainians as less reliable than the Orthodox Volhynian Ukrainians,&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt; seen as better candidates for gradual assimilation. That's why the Polish policy in Ukraine initially aimed at keeping Greek Catholic Galicians from further influencing Orthodox Volhynians by drawing the so-called "Sokalski line".&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;[[Timothy Snyder]], ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999'', Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-10586-X}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030010586X&amp;id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=stanislaw+grabski&amp;sig=5kSKOnXipwsTitk7w_hotRTooPQ No preview available.

Due to the region's history the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] attained a strong Ukrainian national character, and the Polish authorities sought to weaken it in various ways. In 1924, following a visit with the Ukrainian Catholic believers in North America and western Europe, the head of the UGCC was initially denied reentry to Lviv for a considerable amount of time. Polish priests led by their bishops began to undertake missionary work among Eastern Rite faithful, and the administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=Magosci&gt;{{cite book|author=Magosci, P. |title=Morality and Reality: the Life and Times of Andrei Sheptytsky|location=Edmonton, Alberta |publisher=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the Orthodox Ukrainian population in eastern Poland, the [[Polish government]] initially issued a decree defending the rights of the Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the [[Catholics]], also eager to strengthen their position, had official representation in the [[Sejm]] and the courts. Any accusation was strong enough for a particular church to be confiscated and handed over to the Roman Catholic Church. The goal of the two so called "[[Recovery of Orthodox Churches in the Second Polish Republic|revindication campaigns]]" was to deprive the Orthodox of those churches that had been Greek Catholic before Orthodoxy was imposed by the tsarist Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.

===== Education =====
The Polish administration closed many of the popular [[Prosvita]] Society reading rooms, an action which, combined with the devastation brought about during the war years, produced a marked decline in the number of reading rooms, from 2,879 in 1914 to only 843 in 1923.

As for the educational system, the provincial school administration from the Austrian era, which was based in L'viv and had separate Ukrainian representation, was abolished in January 1921. All decisions were subsequently to be made in Warsaw and to be implemented by administrators in local school districts.  Ukrainians now found themselves within six different school districts (L'viv, Volhynia, Polissia, Cracow, Lublin, and Bialystok), although at least initially the Ukrainian school system, especially at the elementary level, was left undisturbed.&lt;ref name="Magosci_History" /&gt;{{Rp|588}}

In 1924, the government of Prime Minister [[Władysław Grabski]] passed a law  (known as the lex Grabski),  over the objections of Ukrainian parliamentary representatives, which set up bilingual Ukrainian and Polish schools. The result was a rapid decline in the number of unilingual Ukrainian schools together with a sharp increase in Polish-Ukrainian bilingual schools in Galicia and Polish schools in Volhynia (1,459 in 1938).&lt;ref name="Magosci_History" /&gt;{{Rp|594}}

Since Ukrainians in Poland had only limited control over the formal education of their children, the [[Plast]]  scouting movement took up the challenge of inculcating youth with a Ukrainian national identity. Plast scouts came into being on the eve of World War I on Ukrainian lands in both the Russian and the Austro-Hungarian empires, but it was during the interwar years in western Ukraine (in particular Galicia and Transcarpathia)  that they had their greatest success. By 1930, the organization had over 6,000 male and female members in branches affiliated with secondary schools in Galicia and with Prosvita societies in western Volhynia.  Concerned by Plast's general popularity and the fact that many of its 'graduates' after age eighteen joined clandestine Ukrainian nationalist organizations, Poland's authorities increased restrictions on the movement until banning it entirely after 1930. It nonetheless continued to operate underground or through other organizations for the rest of the decade.

The principle of "numerus clausus" had been introduced following which the Ukrainians were discriminated when entering the [[Lviv University]] (not more than 15% of the applicants' total number, the Poles enjoying not less than the 50% quota at the same time).&lt;ref name="National University of L'viv"&gt;[http://www.lnu.edu.ua/general/about.htm Brief history of L'viv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513221016/http://www.lnu.edu.ua/general/about.htm|date=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Land reform =====
The land reform designed to favour the Poles in [[Volhynia]],&lt;ref name="Snyder146"&gt;Snyder, [[op cit]], [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030010586X&amp;id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;printsec=8&amp;vq=land+reform&amp;dq=stanislaw+grabski&amp;sig=uO4Yn_X9AzqyZUipRUXtEeDUZC8 Google Print, p.146]&lt;/ref&gt; where the land question was especially severe, and brought the alienation from the Polish state of even the Orthodox Volhynian population who tended to be much less radical than the Greek Catholic Galicians.&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;

Traditionally, Volhynian Ukrainian peasants had benefited from rights of use in the commons, which in Volhynia meant the right to collect wood from forests owned by nobles. When all land was treated as private property with defined owners, such traditional rights could not be enforced. Forests were cleared, and the lumber sold abroad. Volhynian peasants lost access to what had been a common ''good'', without profiting from its commercialization and sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868007863|title=Sketches from a secret war : a Polish artist's mission to liberate Soviet Ukraine|last=Timothy.|first=Snyder,|isbn=0300125992|location=New Haven|oclc=868007863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1938 nearly two million acres (some 800,000 hectares) had been redistributed within Ukrainian-inhabited areas. The redistribution did not necessarily help the local Ukrainian population,  however. For instance, as early as 1920, 39 percent of the newly allotted land in Volhynia and Polissia  (771,000 acres [312,000 hectares]) had been awarded as political patronage to veterans of Poland's 'war for independence,' and in eastern Galicia much land  (494,000 acres [200,000 hectares]) had been given to land-hungry Polish peasants from the western provinces of the country. This meant that by the 1930s the number of Poles living within contiguous Ukrainian ethnographic territory had increased by about 300,000.&lt;ref name="Magosci_History" /&gt;{{Rp|586}}

====Lithuanian lands====
During the [[interbellum|interwar period]] of the 20th century (1920–1939), [[Lithuanian–Polish relations]] were characterized by mutual enmity. As a consequence of the conflict over the city of [[Vilnius]], and the [[Polish–Lithuanian War]], both governments – in the era of nationalism which was sweeping through Europe – treated their respective minorities harshly.&lt;ref name="Żołędowski114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makowski244"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/LithuaniaRN1.3.pdf |title=Lithuania|accessdate=2007-06-18 |last= Fearon |first=James D. |author2=Laitin, David D. |year=2006 |format=pdf |publisher=Stanford University |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, after the staged mutiny of [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|Lucjan Żeligowski]], Lithuanian cultural activities in Polish controlled territories were limited and the closure of Lithuanian newspapers and the arrest of their editors occurred.&lt;ref name="Čepėnas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Čepėnas |first=Pranas |authorlink=Pranas Čepėnas | title=Naujųjų laikų Lietuvos istorija |year=1986 |publisher=Dr. Griniaus fondas |location=Chicago |pages=655, 656}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of them – [[Mykolas Biržiška]] was accused of state treason and sentenced to the death penalty and only the direct intervention by the [[League of Nations]] saved him from being executed. He was one of 32 Lithuanian and Belarusian cultural activists formally expelled from Vilnius on 20 September 1922 and deported to Lithuania.&lt;ref name="Čepėnas"/&gt; In 1927, as tensions between Lithuania and Poland increased, 48 additional Lithuanian schools were closed and another 11 Lithuanian activists were deported.&lt;ref name="Żołędowski114"&gt;Żołędowski, Cezary (2003).

Warszawa: ASPRA-JR. {{ISBN|8388766767}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski's]] death in 1935, the [[Lithuanian minority in Poland]] again became an object of Polonization policies with greater intensity. 266 Lithuanian schools were closed after 1936 and almost all Lithuanian organizations were banned. Further Polonization ensued as the government encouraged [[Osadnik|settlement of Polish army veterans]] in the disputed regions.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; About 400 Lithuanian reading rooms and libraries were closed in Poland between 1936 and 1938.&lt;ref name="Makowski244"&gt;Makowski, Bronisław (1986).

==Post–World War II==

During [[Operation Vistula]] of 1947, the Soviet-controlled Polish communist authorities removed the support base for the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] by forcibly resettling about 141,000 civilians residing around [[Bieszczady]] and [[Low Beskids]] to northern areas of the so-called [[Recovered Territories]] awarded by [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] to Poland in the post-war settlement. The farmers received financial help from the Polish government and took over homes and farms left behind by the displaced Germans, in most cases improving their living conditions due to increased size of the newly reassigned properties, brick buildings, and running water.&lt;ref name="Palski2008"/&gt; Dr Zbigniew Palski from IPN explains that identical operation was performed in Ukraine by the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic at exactly the same time. It was dubbed Operation West. Both operations were coordinated from Moscow; however, there was a shocking difference between their outcomes.&lt;ref name="Palski2008"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/download.php?s=1&amp;id=16410 | title=Operacja Wisła: komunistyczna akcja represyjna, czy obrona konieczna Rzeczypospolitej? | publisher=Nasz Dziennik, [[Institute of National Remembrance]] | work=Dodatek historyczny IPN Nr. 5/2008 (12) | date=30 May 2008 | accessdate=12 July 2015 | author=Dr Zbigniew Palski | at=pp. 6–7 (3–4 in PDF) | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229100110/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/download.php?s=1&amp;id=16410 | archivedate=29 December 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Operation Vistula was underway in south-western Poland, the Soviet NKVD deported over 114,000 mostly women and children from [[West Ukraine]] to [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] and Siberia during parallel Operation West.&lt;ref name="Palski2008"/&gt; Only 19,000 men were among the Soviet deportees,&lt;ref name="Palski2008"/&gt; most of them sent to coal mines and stone quarries in the north. None of the families deported by the NKVD received any farms or empty homes to live in. They were instantaneously forced into extreme poverty and hunger.&lt;ref name="Palski2008"/&gt; Dr Zbigniew Palski informs also that during Operation Vistula none of the three conditions of the [[United Nations Charter]] of 26 June 1945 about the possible struggle toward their own self-determination among the Polish deportees was broken at the time. Other international laws were already in effect.&lt;ref name="Palski2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8660">'''The Q Hall of Fame Canada''' is a national resource dedicated to house and commemorate the diverse history of the [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender]] community in [[Canada]]. They honour those that have been human rights pioneers and document the accomplishments and lives of these amazing people.  Headquartered in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], the Q Hall of Fame is an independently registered federal not for profit organization with the [[Minister of Industry (Canada)|Minister of Industry for Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporations.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/cs04522.html|title=Letters Patent (CCA)|publisher=Industry Canada|date=2010|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Q Hall of Fame Canada was created in 2009 by founder and chair, Paul Therien.  It was in response to what he perceived to be a lack of recognition for people who have greatly impacted the lives of LGBTQ Canadians through their dedication to human rights.&lt;ref name="WFP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/trudeau-named-to-queer-hall-of-fame-59930437.html|title=Trudeau named to Queer Hall of Fame|last=Theodore|first=Terri|date=20 September 2009|publisher=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an independent entity and is not associated directly with [[Qmunity]] in governance or management. At the inaugural induction ceremony for the Q Hall of Fame, known as Q Ball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/alternative-awards-q-ball|title=Alternative Lifestyle Awards|publisher=Trendhunter Social|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qmunity was the "selected beneficiary" of the 2009 proceeds and "a possible future home of the hall's memorabilia", however a recent shift in the mandate of the Hall of Fame has amended that.&lt;ref name="Perelle, 2009-09-24"&gt;{{cite news |title=QBall's lessons |first=Robin |last=Perelle |url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/Vancouver/QBalls_lessons-7554.aspx |newspaper=[[Xtra!]] |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Inductees for the Q Hall of Fame are selected through a public nomination process. Nominees are usually members of the LGBT community themselves, although heterosexual allies who have played prominent roles in the protection or advancement of LGBT equality rights in Canada — such as former Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] — may also be honoured. 

At the 2009 induction ceremony, entertainer Robert Kaiser (also known as Joan-E) was the first inductee into the Hall of Fame,&lt;ref name="Perelle, 2009-09-24"/&gt; and he was followed by Olympic [[gold medal]]ist [[Mark Tewksbury]], head of the Canadian Drag Court [[International Court System|Ted Northe]], author and bookseller [[Janine Fuller]]&lt;ref name="WFP" /&gt; and former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]], for his role in [[decriminalization|decriminalising]] [[homosexuality]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pierre Trudeau inducted into Queer Hall of Fame |first=Kevin |last=Jess |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/279496 |newspaper=DigitalJournal.com |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Held every two years, Q Ball was held in [[Vancouver]] in 2009, and again in 2011.  In 2013 Q Ball will be held in [[Toronto]], in keeping with the mandate that the event be accessible to all Canadians. All nominations are reviewed by an independent selection committee which comprises community members from across Canada. The identities of the members of the selection committee are kept strictly confidential to ensure that they remain as unbiased as possible when reviewing the nominations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3369">The '''Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House''' is responsible for the day-to-day running of the [[Tower of London]].

The [[Constable of the Tower]] is the most senior appointment at the Tower of London. Under the [[Queen's Regulations]] for the Army, the office of constable is conferred on a field marshal or retired general officer for a five-year term. At the conclusion of the Constable's installation ceremony, the [[Lord Chamberlain]] symbolically hands the palace over to the Constable. He in turn entrusts it to the Resident Governor.

The offices of ''Resident Governor of the Tower of London'' and  ''[[Master of the Jewel Office|Keeper of the Jewel House]]'' were amalgamated in 1967.&lt;ref name="HolmesSitwell1972"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Holmes|author2=Major-General H. D. W. Sitwell|title=The English Regalia: Rheir History, Custody and Display|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ8sAQAAIAAJ|year=1972|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-1167-0407-8|page=v|quote=It would perhaps be appropriate at this stage to mention that the in 1967 the Jewel House in the Tower and the staff was increased and reorganised. The Officer-in-Charge is now also the Resident Governor - the two posts having been merged under the title of Resident Governor and Keeper of the Jewel House. He is an officer of the Royal House hold and is responsible, only as far a custody of the Crown Jewels in the Tower is concerned, to the Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household who has had control of the Jewel House since 1782.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rights and Equality Party''' ({{lang-tr|Hak ve Eşitlik Partisi}}, '''HEPAR''') is a political party in [[Turkey]], founded on 4 September 2008 by [[Osman Pamukoğlu]], a former army general known for his military successes against the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] in the 1990s during the [[Turkey–PKK conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hakveesitlik.org.tr/osman-pamukoglu-kimdir.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229025604/http://www.hakveesitlik.org.tr/osman-pamukoglu-kimdir.html |date=December 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's main manifest is the setting sovereignty, own based economical development and peace for Turkish citizens. The party has 8,273 members as of 2014.&lt;ref name="hakveesitlik1"&gt;[http://www.hakveesitlik.org.tr/dosya/siyasal_ve_toplumsal_ilkelerimiz.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229015024/http://www.hakveesitlik.org.tr/dosya/siyasal_ve_toplumsal_ilkelerimiz.pdf |date=December 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party claims their ideology as being neither on the right nor left, above all with populist, nationalist aiming social justice for Turkish citizens. The party chairman Osman Pamukoğlu often mentions [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s quote as "Our target is being a merged society with no classes and privileges."&lt;ref name="hakveesitlik1"/&gt;

The party has gained 121,814 votes during the [[Turkish general election, 2011|2011 elections]], comprising 0.28% of the votes.

'''Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa''' (July 18, 1906 – February 27, 1992) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born American academic and politician of [[Japanese Americans|Japanese]] ancestry. A professor of [[English studies|English]], he served as president of [[San Francisco State University]],&lt;ref name=hwlret&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NM8RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VO0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3914%2C5372406 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=''(Los Angeles Times)'' |title=Hayakawa will retire |date=October 13, 1972 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then as [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[California]] from 1977 to 1983.&lt;ref name=ergobtlat&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zk9WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6777%2C6007646 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=''(Los Angeles Times)'' |title=S.I. Hayakawa, 85, dies; challenged '60s radicals |date=February 28, 1992 |page=7A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Hayakawa was educated in the public schools of [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], and received an undergraduate degree from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1927 and graduate degrees in English from [[McGill University]] in 1928 and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="thesis-hayakawa-1935"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/301811415/ |title=Oliver Wendell Holmes: Physician, poet, essayist |date=1935 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Hayakawa |first=Samuel I. |via=[[ProQuest]] |subscription=yes |oclc=51566055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Professionally, Hayakawa was a [[linguistics|linguist]], psychologist, [[semantics|semanticist]], teacher, and writer. He served as an instructor at the [[University of Wisconsin]] from 1936 to 1939 and at the Armour Institute of Technology (now [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]) from 1939 to 1948.

His first book on semantics, ''[[Language in Thought and Action]]'', was published in 1949 as an expansion of the earlier work, ''Language in Action'', written since 1938 and published in 1941 to be a [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] selection. It is currently in its fifth edition and has greatly helped to popularize [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]] and semantics in general, while semantics or theory of meaning was overwhelmed{{when|date=April 2018}} by [[mysticism]], [[propagandism]] and even [[scientism]].{{clarify|date=March 2017}} In the preface, Hayakawa cautioned:

{{quote|The original version of this book, ''Language in Action'', published in 1941, was in many respects a response to the dangers of propaganda, especially as exemplified in Adolf Hitler's success in persuading millions to share his maniacal and destructive views. It was the writer's conviction then, as it remains now, that everyone needs to have a habitually critical attitude towards language—his own as well as that of others—both for the sake of his personal well being and for his adequate functioning as a citizen. Hitler is gone, but if the majority of our fellow citizens are more susceptible to the slogans of fear and race hatred than to those of peaceful accommodation and mutual respect among human beings, our political liberties remain at the mercy of any eloquent and unscrupulous demagogue.}}

In addition to such motivation, he acknowledged his debt as follows:

{{quote|My deepest debt in this book is to the General Semantics ('non-Aristotelian system') of Alfred Korzybski. I have also drawn heavily upon the works of other contributors to semantic thought: especially C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards, Thorstein Veblen, Edward Sapir, Leonard Bloomfield, Karl R. Popper, Thurman Arnold, Jerome Frank, Jean Piaget, Charles Morris, Wendell Johnson, Irving J. Lee, Ernst Cassirer, Anatol Rapoport, Stuart Chase. I am also deeply indebted to the writings of numerous psychologists and psychiatrists with one or another of the dynamic points of view inspired by Sigmund Freud: Karl Menninger, Trigant Burrow, Carl Rogers, Kurt Lewin, N. R. F. Maier, Jurgen Ruesch, Gregory Bateson, Rudolf Dreikurs, Milton Rokeach. I have also found extremely helpful the writings of cultural anthropologists, especially those of Benjamin Lee Whorf, Ruth Benedict, Clyde Kluckhohn, Leslie A. White, Margaret Mead, Weston La Barre.}}

He was a lecturer at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1950 to 1955. During this time he presented a talk at the 1954 Conference of '''Activity Vector Analysts'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webava.com/home.asp |title=WebAVA |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Lake George, New York|Lake George]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in which he discussed a theory of personality from the semantic point of view. This was later published as ''The Semantic Barrier''. This was a definitive lecture as it discussed the [[Darwinism]] of the "survival of self" as contrasted with the "survival of [[self-concept]]". His ideas on general semantics influenced [[A. E. van Vogt]]'s Null-A novels, ''[[The World of Null-A]]'' and ''[[The Pawns of Null-A]]''. Van Vogt in ''The World of Null-A'' (i.e., non-Aristotelian) makes Hayakawa a character, introducing him as: "Professor Hayakawa is today's Mr. Null-A himself, the elected head of the International Society for General Semantics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Elton Van Vogt|title=The World of Null-A|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WtbAAAAMAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Berkley Books|location=New York|page=11|isbn=9780425054543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayakawa was an English professor at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]] (now San Francisco State University) from 1955 to 1968. In the early 1960s, he helped organize the ''Anti Digit Dialing League'', a San Francisco group that opposed the introduction of all-digit [[telephone exchange names]]. Among the students he trained were commune leader [[Stephen Gaskin]] and author [[Gerald Haslam]]. He was named acting president of San Francisco State College (now [[San Francisco State University]]) on November 26, 1968, when [[Ronald Reagan]] was [[governor of California]] and [[Joseph Alioto]] was [[mayor of San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="on strike"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpllweb.sfsu.edu/exhibits/strike/case3-text.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831043627/http://jpllweb.sfsu.edu/exhibits/strike/case3-text.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 31, 2016|title=Case 3: Prelude / Demands|work=On Strike!

Hayakawa wrote a column for the [[Register and Tribune Syndicate]] from 1970 to 1976. In 1973, Hayakawa changed his political affiliation from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and became president emeritus at what became San Francisco State University.&lt;ref name="OAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3199r7x0/admin/|title=Guide to the Samuel I.

===Student strike at San Francisco State College===
In 1968–69, there was a bitter student and [[Black Panthers]] strike at San Francisco State University in order to establish an [[ethnic studies]] program. It was a major news event at the time and chapter in the radical history of the [[United States]] and the Bay Area. The strike was led by the [[Third World Liberation Front]] supported by [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panthers]] and the countercultural community.

It proposed fifteen "non-negotiable demands", including a [[Black Studies]] department chaired by sociologist [[Nathan Hare]] independent of the university administration and open admission to all black students to "put an end to racism", and the unconditional, immediate end to the [[War in Vietnam]] and the university's involvement. It was threatened that if these demands were not immediately and completely satisfied the entire campus was to be forcibly shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayward|first=Steven|title=The Age of Reagan, Volume I|publisher=Crown Forum|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayakawa became popular with conservative voters in this period after he pulled the wires out from the loud speakers on a protesters' van at an outdoor rally.&lt;ref name=hwlret/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=James M.

==Political career==
Hayakawa won an unexpected victory in the 1976 Republican senate primary over three better-known career politicians including HEW Secretary [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]], long-time Congressman [[Alphonso Bell]], and California Lt. Governor [[John L. Harmer]]. Much like [[Jimmy Carter]], Hayakawa touted himself as a political outsider.
[[Image:1977 Hayakawa p15.jpg|thumb|160px|right|1977, ''Congressional Pictorial Directory'']]

On the Democratic side, incumbent Senator [[John V. Tunney|John Tunney]] faced a surprisingly strong challenge from another political outsider, [[Tom Hayden]].  Hayden's extremely liberal candidacy forced Tunney to run more to the left in the primary, which hurt him in the general election.

Nevertheless, Tunney was favored{{by whom|date=April 2018}} to easily win re-election. Comfortably ahead in the polls, Tunney did not aggressively campaign until the final weeks before the election. But Hayakawa's position as a political outsider was popular in the wake of the [[Watergate Scandal]]. In addition, Tunney had a high absenteeism rate while serving in the Senate and missed numerous votes. Hayakawa exploited this with a TV ad that showed an empty chair in the US Senate chamber.  Hayakawa gradually closed the gap with Tunney, and ultimately defeated him by just over three percentage points.

During his 1976 Senate campaign, he spoke about the proposal to transfer possession of the [[Panama Canal]] and [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] from the United States to [[Panama]]. Hayakawa said, "We should keep the Panama Canal. After all, we stole it fair and square."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anvari.org/fortune/Miscellaneous_Collections/416905_we-should-keep-the-panama-canal-after-all-we-stole-it-fair-and-square-s-i.html |title=We Should Keep The Panama Canal. After All, We Stole It Fair And Square. – S.I |publisher=Anvari.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1978 he helped win Senate approval of the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]], which transferred control of the zone and canal to Panama.&lt;ref name=LAT1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-28/news/mn-2960_1_state-college/2 |title=Ex-Sen. Hayakawa Dies; Unpredictable Iconoclast ...|first= |last=staff |date=February 28, 1992|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported a bill that led to the creation of the [[Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians]], which examined the causes and effects of the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|incarceration of Japanese Americans]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Robinson |first=Greg |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/S.I.%20Hayakawa/ |title=S.I. Hayakawa |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in the U.S. Senate, Hayakawa was one of three [[Japanese American]]s in the chamber, the other two being [[Daniel Inouye]] and [[Spark Matsunaga]], both of [[Hawaii]].

He planned to run for reelection in 1982 but trailed other Republican candidates badly in early polls and was short on money.  He dropped out of the race early in the year and was ultimately succeeded by Republican [[San Diego]] [[Mayor of San Diego|mayor]] [[Pete Wilson]].

Hayakawa founded the political lobbying organization [[U.S. English (organization)|U.S. English]], which is dedicated to making the [[English language]] the [[official language]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccis.ucsd.edu/PUBLICATIONS/wrkg141.pdf |title=Language politics and policy in the United States: Implications for the immigration debate*, Working Paper 141 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103095937/http://ccis.ucsd.edu/PUBLICATIONS/wrkg141.pdf |archivedate=November 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{confusing|date=November 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Achieving the Impossible Dream: How Japanese Americans Obtained Redress | first1= Mitchell Takeshi | last1= Maki | first2= Harry H.

== Personal life ==
Hayakawa was a resident of [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]], California, until his death in nearby [[Greenbrae, California|Greenbrae]], in 1992. He was also a member of the [[Bohemian Club]].{{citation needed|date= November 2014}} He had an abiding interest in [[traditional jazz]] and wrote extensively on that subject, including several erudite sets of album [[liner notes]]. Sometimes in his lectures on semantics, he was joined by the respected traditional [[jazz piano|jazz pianist]] [[Don Ewell]], whom Hayakawa employed to demonstrate various points in which he analyzed semantic and musical principles. Hayakawa was often favorite fodder for the news media reporters, every time he was found napping through important legislative voting.&lt;ref name=ergobtlat/&gt;&lt;!--{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}--&gt;

He was the nephew-in-law of [[Joseph Stalin]], in that his wife Margedant's brother [[William Wesley Peters]] was married to Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''SecureDrop''' is an [[open-source software]] platform for [[secure communication]] between [[journalist]]s and [[Source (journalism)|sources]] ([[whistleblower]]s).&lt;ref name=Guardian-SecureDrop-2014&gt;{{cite news|first1= James|last1=Ball|title= Guardian launches SecureDrop system for whistleblowers to share files|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/guardian-launches-securedrop-whistleblowers-documents|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally designed and developed by [[Aaron Swartz]] and [[Kevin Poulsen]] under the name ''DeadDrop''.&lt;ref name=kassner2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/aaron-swartz-legacy-lives-on-with-new-yorkers-strongbox-how-it-works/ |title=Aaron Swartz legacy lives on with New Yorker's Strongbox: How it works |last1=Kassner |first1=Michael |date=20 May 2013 |website=[[TechRepublic]] |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorker-StrongboxAaronSwartz-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poulsen|first1=Kevin|title=Strongbox and Aaron Swartz|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/strongbox-and-aaron-swartz|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=14 May 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Dolan (computer security expert)|James Dolan]] also co-created the software.&lt;ref name=FreedomPressFdn-Dolan-Obit-2018&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timm|first1=Trevor|title=A tribute to James Dolan, co-creator of SecureDrop, who has tragically passed away at age 36|url=https://freedom.press/news/tribute-james-dolan-co-creator-securedrop-who-has-tragically-passed-away-age-36/|work=[[Freedom of the Press Foundation]]|date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After Aaron Swartz's death, the first instance of the platform was launched under the name ''Strongbox'' by staff at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on 15 May 2013.&lt;ref name=davidson2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/05/introducing-strongbox-anonymous-document-sharing-tool.html |title=Introducing Strongbox |last1=Davidson |first1=Amy |authorlink1=Amy Davidson (author) |date=15 May 2013 |website=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=20 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]] took over development of DeadDrop under the name ''SecureDrop'', and has since assisted with its installation at several news organizations, including [[ProPublica]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Intercept]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="strongbox"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New Yorker|url=https://projects.newyorker.com/strongbox/ |title=Strongbox|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="luxembourg"&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1308.6768|last1=Biryukov|first1=Alex|title=Content and popularity analysis of Tor hidden services|last2=Pustogarov|first2=Ivan|last3=Thill|first3=Fabrice|last4=Weinmann|first4=Ralf-Philipp|class=cs.CR|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite news|author=Davidson, Amy|date=15 May 2013|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/05/introducing-strongbox-anonymous-document-sharing-tool.html |title=Introducing Strongbox|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==

SecureDrop uses the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] to facilitate communication between [[whistleblowers]], journalists, and news organizations. SecureDrop sites are therefore only accessible as hidden services in the Tor network. After a user visits a SecureDrop website, they are given a randomly generated code name.&lt;ref name= davidson2013/&gt; This code name is used to send information to a particular author or editor via uploading. [[Investigative journalist]]s can contact the whistleblower via SecureDrop messaging. Therefore, the whistleblower must take note of their random code name.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;

The system utilizes private, segregated [[server (computing)|servers]] that are in the possession of the news organization. Journalists use two [[USB flash drive]]s and two personal computers to access SecureDrop data.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;&lt;ref name= davidson2013/&gt; The first personal computer accesses SecureDrop via the Tor network, the journalist uses the first flash drive to download [[encrypted]] data from the Internet. The second personal computer does not connect to the Internet, and is wiped during each reboot.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;&lt;ref name= davidson2013/&gt; The second flash drive contains a [[decryption]] code. The first and second flash drives are inserted into the second personal computer, and the material becomes available to the journalist. The personal computer is shut down after each use.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;

Freedom of the Press Foundation has stated it will have the SecureDrop code and security environment audited by an independent third party before every major version release and then publish the results.&lt;ref name=second-audit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timm|first1=Trevor|title=SecureDrop Undergoes Second Security Audit|url=https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/01/securedrop-undergoes-second-security-audit|accessdate=13 July 2014|agency=Freedom of the Press Foundation|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first audit was conducted by University of Washington security researchers and [[Bruce Schneier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Czeskis|first1=Alexei|last2=Mah|first2=David|last3=Sandoval|first3=Omar|last4=Smith|first4=Ian|last5=Koscher|first5=Karl|last6=Appelbaum|first6=Jacob|last7=Kohno|first7=Tadayoshi|last8=Schneier|first8=Bruce|title=DeadDrop/StrongBox Security Assessment|url=http://www.czeskis.com/research/pubs/UW-CSE-13-08-02.PDF|publisher=University of Washington Department of Computer Science and Engineering|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second audit was conducted by [[Cure53]], a German security firm.&lt;ref name=second-audit/&gt;

SecureDrop suggests sources disable [[JavaScript]] to protect anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/source.html Source Guide] SecureDrop&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent organizations using SecureDrop==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3211">[[Image:serkland.jpg|thumb|'''srklant''' on the [[Tillinge Runestone]] raised in memory of a [[Varangians|Varangian]] who did not return from Serkland, at the church of Tillinge in [[Uppland]], [[Sweden]].]]

In [[Old Norse]] sources, such as [[saga]]s and [[runestone]]s, '''Serkland''' (also ''Særkland'', ''Srklant'', ''Sirklant'', ''Serklat'', etc.) was the "land of the ''Serkir''", usually identified with the [[Saracens]].

The exact etymology is disputed. ''Serk''- may derive from "Saracen"; from ''sericum'', Latin for "silk", implying a connection with the [[Silk Road]]; from the Khazar fortress of [[Sarkel]]; or from ''serkr'', shirt or gown, i.e., "land of the gown-wearers". In all cases it refers to a land in the East. Originally, it referred to the land south of the [[Caspian Sea]], but it gradually expanded to cover all Islamic lands, including in Africa (and possibly even [[Muslim Sicily]]).&lt;ref&gt;Judith Jesch, ''Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse'' (Boydell, 2001), p. 104ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Brink, "People and land in Early Scandinavia", in Ildar H. Garipzanov, Patrick Geary and Przemyslaw Urbanczyk (eds.), ''Franks, Northmen, and Slavs: Identities and State Formation in Early Medieval Europe'' (Brepols, 2008) p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably one of the [[Ingvar runestones]], the [[Ingvar runestones#Sö 179|Sö 179]], raised circa 1040 at [[Gripsholm Castle]], commemorates a [[Varangians|Varangian]] loss during an ill-fated raid in Serkland. The other remaining runestones that talk of Serkland are [[Ingvar runestones#Sö 131|Sö 131]], [[Ingvar runestones#Sö 279|Sö 279]], [[Ingvar runestones#Sö 281|Sö 281]], the [[Tillinge Runestone]] and probably the lost runestone [[Ingvar runestones#U 439|U 439]]. For a detailed account of such raids, see [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus']].

Several sagas mention Serkland: ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', ''[[Sörla saga sterka]]'', ''[[Sörla þáttr]]'', ''[[Saga Sigurðar Jórsalafara]]'' and ''[[Hjálmþés saga ok Ölvis]]''. It is also mentioned by the 11th century [[skald]] [[Þórgils Fiskimaðr]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://skaldic.arts.usyd.edu.au/db.php?table=verses&amp;id=4301 Þórgils fiskimaðr, Nordmand, 11 årh. (AI, 400-1, BI, 369).]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 12th century skald [[Þórarinn Stuttfeldr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skaldic.arts.usyd.edu.au/db.php?table=verses&amp;id=4627 Þórarinn stuttfeldr, Islandsk skjald, 12. årh. (AI, 489-92, BI, 461-4).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shipley Art Gallery''' is an art gallery in [[Gateshead]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[England]], located at the south end of Prince Consort Road.  It has a Designated Collection of national importance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/ne000029|title=Shipley Art Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=Culture24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Shipley Art Gallery opened to the public in 1917. This was made possible by a bequest from wealthy local solicitor and art collector, Joseph Ainsley Davidson Shipley (1822–1909).

Shipley was a rather enigmatic person about whom little is known. He was born in Gateshead, near High Street. He was a solicitor in the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] firm of Hoyle, Shipley and Hoyle. From 1884 until his death, he leased [[Saltwell Park]] House, now known as Saltwell Towers. Shipley’s main passion was art and collecting paintings. He bought his first painting when he was sixteen and by the time he died he had amassed a collection of some 2,500 paintings.

On his death, Shipley left £30,000 and all his pictures to the City of Newcastle, which was to build a new gallery to house the collection. This was to be known as "The Shipley Bequest". His will specifically excluded the [[Laing Art Gallery]] in Newcastle from benefiting from the bequest, and this clause became the subject of much public discussion, and eventually led to Newcastle's rejection of the bequest. It was only following this that Gateshead Municipal Council was offered the collection. As it was impossible to house all of the paintings, 359 of the pictures recommended by the executors of Shipley's will were selected. A further group was then added by the Gateshead Committee, bringing the total to 504.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/theatre-news/gallery-opens-doors-reveal-delights-1630079|title=Gallery opens the doors to reveal its delights|last=|first=|date=8 September 2004|work=Evening Chronicle|access-date=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, after the sale of the remaining paintings, work began on the new art gallery. The building, which was designed by Arthur Stockwell, M.S.A. of Newcastle, opened on 29 November 1917.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The stone entrance portico is ''[[distyle in antis]]'' – four Corinthian-style stone columns flanked by solid pilasters. These are surmounted by two sculptured figures, one representing the Arts and the other Industry and Learning, by [[William Birnie Rhind|W. Birnie Rhind]], [[Royal Scottish Academy|R.S.A]]. of [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xD9IAQAAIAAJ|title=Newcastle and Gateshead|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-300-12664-8|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pevsner described the art gallery as a "bold arrangement of a brick central block and lower wings containing galleries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjHcM_LXhjEC|title=County Durham|author1=Nikolaus Pevsner|author2=Elizabeth Williamson|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0-300-09599-9|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designated as [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II listed]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1248566|desc=Shipley Art Gallery|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present gallery==
The original 504 paintings represented all the main European schools from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. Since 1917, the collection has been added to, and now comprises some 10,000 items.

William C. Irving's painting, "Blaydon Races" captures the spirit of the traditional [[Blaydon Races]], and takes pride of place at the gallery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The gallery also holds a strong collection of 16th and 17th century Dutch and Flemish paintings, as well as 19th century British works, watercolours, prints, drawings and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shipleyartgallery.org.uk/collections/our-collections|title=Our collections|last=|first=|date=|website=Shipley Art Gallery|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977 the gallery has become established as a national centre for contemporary craftwork. It has built up one of the best collections outside London, which includes ceramics, wood, metal, glass, textiles and furniture.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shipleyartgallery.org.uk/about-us/about-the-shipley|title=About the Shipley|last=|first=|date=|website=Shipley Art Gallery|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Shipley opened its ''Designs for Life'' gallery which showcases the gallery's collections of contemporary craft and design. The Gallery also hosts a varied programme of temporary exhibitions and has a strong partnership with the [[V&amp;A Museum]] in London.

The Shipley Art Gallery is managed by [[Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums]] on behalf of [[Gateshead Council]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

'''Simanke v Liu''' (1994) 2 NZ ConvC 191,888 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding cancellation of a contract under the Contractual Remedies Act, any deposit in excess of a customary deposit, in this case 10%, is refundable to the purchaser.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Simanke agreed to sell a property to Liu for $650,000, with the sales agreement stating that a deposit of $300,000 be payable within 14 days.

The contract was later cancelled, and Siminake sued for the $300,000 deposit. Liu defended the claim by saying as under the Contractual Remedies At 1979, once a contract is cancelled, no party is obliged to perform any further on a contract. Simanke argued that the Act still requires the deposit to be paid.

==Held==
The court ruled that in New Zealand, the customary deposit is 10%, meaning in this case, $300,000 was not in the nature of a deposit, and so was not enforceable here. Furthermore, Simanke's claim was not helped either by the fact that the sales agreement had limited the forfeiture of deposit to be only 10% anyway. Simanke's claim was dismissed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2152">A '''sub-field dictionary''' is a [[specialized dictionary]] that has been designed and compiled to cover the terms of one (or possibly more) sub-fields of a particular subject field. It is therefore a sub-division of the class of dictionary called a [[single-field dictionary]]. Sub-field dictionaries should be contrasted with multi-field dictionaries and single-field dictionaries.

The typology consisting of these three dictionaries is important for a number of reasons. First of all a sub-field dictionary is an example of a very specialized dictionary in that it covers only a limited part of one single subject field. Examples of sub-field dictionaries are a dictionary of contract law (as opposed to the single-field dictionary of law) and a dictionary of fusion welding (as opposed to a dictionary of welding), or a dictionary of ethical philosophy (as opposed to a dictionary of philosophy).

The main advantage of sub-field dictionaries is that they can easily be [[maximizing dictionary|maximizing dictionaries]], i.e. deep rather than broad, attempting to cover as many terms of the sub-field as possible without expanding into several volumes. Consequently, sub-field dictionaries are ideal for extensive coverage of the linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within a particular subject field.

Secondly, if the lexicographers intend to make a bilingual, maximizing sub-field dictionary they will not run into the same problems with the space available for presenting the large amount of data that has to be included in the dictionary, cf. a [[multi-field dictionary]].

Consequently, the best coverage of linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within the subject field covered by a dictionary will be found in a sub-field dictionary. The best coverage of a subject field will then be to compile a number of sub-field dictionaries that together cover the entire subject.

{{refimprove|date=February 2014}}

A '''technical standard''' is an established [[norm (social)|norm]] or [[requirement]] in regard to technical [[system]]s. It is usually a formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods, processes, and practices. In contrast, a custom, [[Convention (norm)|convention]], company product, corporate standard, and so forth that becomes generally accepted and dominant is often called a [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]]. 

A technical standard may be developed privately or unilaterally, for example by a corporation, regulatory body, military, etc.  Standards can also be developed by groups such as trade unions and trade associations. [[Standards organizations]] often have more diverse input and usually develop voluntary standards: these might become mandatory if adopted by a government (i.e., through [[legislation]]), business contract, etc.

The [[standardization]] process may be by edict or may involve the formal consensus&lt;ref&gt;Example of [https://archive.is/20120913132347/http://www.tappi.org/s_tappi/doc.asp?CID=107&amp;DID=551843 TAPPI standards development regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; of technical experts.

==Types==
The primary types of technical standards are:
* A ''standard [[specification]]'' is an explicit set of requirements for an item, material, component, system or service. It is often used to formalize the technical aspects of a procurement agreement or [[contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Specifications|url=http://www.oregon.gov/odot/hwy/specs/pages/standard_specifications.aspx|website=Oregon.gov|publisher=Oregon.gov|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there may be a specification for a turbine blade for a jet engine that defines the exact material and performance requirements.
* A ''standard [[test method]]'' describes a definitive procedure that produces a test result.  It may involve making a careful personal observation or conducting a highly technical measurement. For example, a [[physical property]] of a material is often affected by the precise method of testing: any reference to the property should therefore reference the test method used.
* A ''standard practice'' or procedure gives a set of instructions for performing operations or functions. For example, there are detailed [[standard operating procedure]]s for operation of a nuclear power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operational Limits and Conditions and Operating Procedures for Nuclear Power Plants Safety Guide|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/books/IAEABooks/6064/Operational-Limits-and-Conditions-and-Operating-Procedures-for-Nuclear-Power-Plants-Safety-Guide|website=International Atomic Energy Association|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''standard guide'' is general information or options that do not require a specific course of action.
* A ''standard [[definition]]'' is formally established terminology.
* ''Standard [[units of measurement|units]]'', in [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], are commonly accepted measurements of physical quantities.

==Availability==
Technical standards may exist as:
* Public documents on the [[internet]], public library, etc. (Some technical standards may be found at a major central library or at the library of a good technical university)
* Published documents available for purchase
* Private documents owned by an organization or corporation, used and circulated as the owner determines necessary or useful
* Documents publicly available under [[intellectual property]] ([[copyright]], etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Example: [http://www.sae.org/about/copyright/ SAE International copyright policy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Closed or controlled documents that contain [[trade secret]]s or [[classified information]]

==Geographic levels==
When a geographically defined community must solve a community-wide [[coordination problem]], it can adopt an existing standard or produce a new one. The main geographic levels are:
* ''National standard'': by [[Standards organizations#National_standards_organizations|National standards organizations]].  For example, [[Telecommunications Industry Association]] standards.
* ''Regional standard'': see standards of the [[Standards organizations#Regional_standards_organizations|Regional standards organizations]]. For example, [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] standards.
* ''[[International standard]]'': see [[Standards organizations#International_standards_organizations|International standards organizations]] Example, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[ASTM International]].

National/Regional/International standards is one way of overcoming technical barriers in inter-local or inter-regional commerce caused by differences among technical regulations and standards developed independently and separately by each local, local [[standards organisation]], or local company. Technical barriers arise when different groups come together, each with a large user base, doing some well established thing that between them is mutually incompatible. Establishing national/regional/international standards is one way of preventing or overcoming this problem.

==Usage==
The existence of a published standard does not imply that it is always useful or correct. For example, if an item complies with a certain standard, there is not necessarily assurance that it is fit for any particular use. The people who use the item or service (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify it (building codes, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the available standards, specify the correct one, enforce compliance, and use the item correctly. [[Validation and verification|Validation]] of suitability is necessary.

Standards often get reviewed, revised and updated on a regular basis.  It is critical that the most current version of a published standard be used or referenced.  The originator or standard writing body often has the current versions listed on its web site. 

In [[social sciences]], including [[economics]], a standard is useful if it is a solution to a [[coordination problem]]: 
it emerges from situations in which all parties realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions.  '''Examples''': 
{| class="wikitable"
!Parties
!Mutual gains
!Problem
!Solution
|-
|[[Secondary sector of the economy|Mechanical industry]] companies
|[[Supply chain|Suppliers]] interchange, stock gains, etc.
|[[Screw#Thread_standards|Screw thread]] compatibility

|-
|[[Pharmaceutical industry]] and [[Medic|medic community]]

'''''The Songlines''''' is a [[1987 in literature|1987]] book written by [[Bruce Chatwin]], combining fiction and non-fiction. Chatwin describes a trip to Australia which he has taken for the express purpose of researching [[Songline|Aboriginal song]] and its connections to nomadic travel. Discussions with Australians, many of them [[Indigenous Australians]], yield insights into [[Outback]] culture, [[Australian Aboriginal culture|Aboriginal culture]] and religion, and the [[Native title|Aboriginal land rights]] movement.

==Synopsis==
Chatwin develops his thesis about the primordial nature of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] song.  The writing engages the hard conditions of life for present day indigenous Australians, while appreciating the art and culture of the people for whom the Songlines are the touchstone of [[the Real|reality]]. The book's first half chronicles the main character's travels through [[Outback Australia]] and his various encounters, while the second half is dedicated to his musings on the nature of man as nomad and settler.

===Thesis===
Chatwin asserts that language started as song, and in the aboriginal [[Dreamtime]], it sang the land into existence for the conscious mind and memory. As you sing the land, the tree, the rock, the path, they come to be, and the singers are one with them. Chatwin combines evidence from Aboriginal culture with modern ideas on human evolution, and argues that on the African [[Savannah]], we were a migratory species hunted by a dominant feline predator. Our wanderings spread "songlines" across the globe (generally from southwest to northeast), eventually reaching Australia, where they are now preserved in the world's oldest living culture.

==Reactions==
Sometimes defined as a travelogue, the text has been criticised for being [[masculist]], colonialist, simplistic and unreliable as both a source on [[European Australians]] and [[Aboriginal culture]]. Other critics have praised it, and Chatwin in the book is vehemently opposed to the image of the inferiority of the Aboriginals; others also see the author as a proponent of postmodern writing, challenging traditional forms of [[linear narrative]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Literary references==
The character Arkady refers to Australia as "the country of lost children".  This was used as the title for Peter Pierce's 1999 book ''The Country of Lost Children: An Australian Anxiety''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1128">In '''''Theron v The Master''''', an important case{{when|date=December 2013}} in the South African law of succession, Mr and Mrs Theron were married in community of property. Mr Theron died and left certain property to his grandson in a trust. Mr Theron’s son was appointed as the trustee,&lt;ref&gt;s 4A(3) of the Wills Act states that this is considered to be a benefit received.&lt;/ref&gt; and had signed the will as a witness. Mrs Theron sought an order declaring that their son could benefit from the will (i.e. be appointed the trustee) despite signing as a witness.

The court considered the facts and held that the testator was not defrauded or unduly influenced; therefore the deceased’s son was competent to be appointed as the trustee of the trust, despite having signed as a witness.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Time'''s List of the 100 Best Novels}}
'''''Time''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s List of the 100 Best Novels''' is an unranked list of the 100 best [[novel]]s—and ten best [[graphic novel]]s—published in the English language between 1923 and 2005. The list was compiled by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' critics [[Lev Grossman]] and [[Richard Lacayo]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/times-list-of-the-100-best-novels/#all |title=Time's List of the 100 Best Novels (1923–2005) |last=Kelly |first=James |author2=Lev Grossman |author3=Richard Lacayo |date=October 16, 2005 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list only includes works between 1923 (when ''Time'' was first published) and 2005 (when the list was compiled). As a result, notable books such as ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by James Joyce—published before 1923—were ineligible for inclusion.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lacayo, [http://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/ "How We Picked the List"], ''Time'', January 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Watchmen]]'' (1986) by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]] appears on both the 100 Best Novels and 10 Best Graphic Novels lists, giving the combined lists 109 entries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49489">The following is a '''timeline of events in the [[Canadian Afghan detainee issue]].''' This includes many specific dates and statements.

==2005-2006==
*On December 18, 2005, in the midst of a [[Canadian federal election, 2006|general election]] and while the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Paul Martin]] was still in power, [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of Defence Staff]] [[Rick Hillier]] signed an agreement between Canada's [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] and the [[Government of Afghanistan]] which did not include any explicit right of access by Canada to Afghan detainees, or any right of notification or veto if Afghanistan wanted to [[extraordinary rendition|transfer a detainee on to a third country]].
*Following the federal election on January 23, 2006, the arrangement is made public by the new Conservative government in March 2006.
*On April 5, 2006, during the first [[question period]] of the 39th Parliament [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) Defence Critic [[Dawn Black]] asked [[Gordon O'Connor]] to renegotiate the prisoner transfer agreement with the Afghan government. O'Connor refused saying "Mr. Speaker, we have no intention of redrafting the agreement. The Red Cross and the Red Crescent are charged with ensuring that prisoners are not abused. There is nothing in the agreement that prevents Canada from determining the fate of prisoners so there is no need to make any change in the agreement." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2155910#Int-1498695
|title=House of Commons Debates, Wednesday, April 5, 2006|publisher=Hansard|date=5 April 2006|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Later in April 2006, Defence Minister [[Gordon O'Connor]] explained that "the process is that if Canadian soldiers capture insurgents or terrorists they hand them over to the Afghan authorities and then the International Red Cross or Red Crescent supervise the detainees. If there is any problem, the Red Cross or Red Crescent would inform us and then we would become involved." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2162028&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1#Int-1502157
|title=House of Commons Debates, Tuesday, April 11, 2006|publisher=Hansard|date=11 April 2006|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Connor reiterated the same theme on May 31, 2006: "If there is something wrong with their treatment, the Red Cross or Red Crescent would inform us and we would take action." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2234500#Int-1558417|title=House of Commons Debates, Wednesday, May 31, 2006|publisher=Hansard|date=31 May 2006|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Cross however said that O'Connor was misunderstanding or misinterpreting their mandate, and it was the Canadians' responsibility.&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;Stein, Janice Gross. &amp; Eugene Lang.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007==
*In early February 2007, University of Ottawa (Canada) Law Professor, [[Amir Attaran]] produced documents he had received through an [[Access to Information Act|Access to Information]](Freedom of Information) request showing that three prisoners in the custody of Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day.  Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture on the part of the interrogator and should be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/02/06/military-probe.html|title=Military probes abuse allegations in Afghanistan|publisher=CBC|date=6 February 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, O'Connor stated that "the president of the Red Cross also said that basically our procedures are absolutely spotless, " O'Connor told reporters last month. "He's quite pleased with what we do with prisoners." &lt;ref name='macleans-20070309'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/homepage/features/article.jsp?content=20070309_132934_9028|title=O'Connor under fire|first=Kady|last=O'Malley|work=Macleans|date=9 March 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On February 26, the Military Police Complaints Commission announced it would be launching an investigation of the handling of detainees following a complaint filed by Amnesty International Canada and the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/26/military-probe.html|title=Civilian agency launches second probe into handling of Afghan detainees|publisher=CBC News|date=26 February 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed that there were allegations that the three prisoners had in fact been abused by Canadian soldiers.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;
*On March 8, 2007, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] stated, in contradiction to O'Connor's earlier words, that it had no role in monitoring the Canada-Afghanistan detainee-transfer agreement.  Its spokesman also indicated that following long-established operating procedure, the Red Cross would not reveal to any foreign government any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070308.wdetainees07/BNStory/National/home|first=Paul|last=Koring|title=Red Cross contradicts Ottawa on detainees|work=The Globe and Mail|date=8 March 2007|accessdate=2007-04-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310201558/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070308.wdetainees07/BNStory/National/home|archivedate=10 March 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Following the Red Cross statement, O'Connor was heavily criticised by the opposition following this revelation &lt;ref name='macleans-20070309'/&gt;  The same day, The Globe and Mail announced that it had discovered the three detainees discussed in the report had subsequently disappeared after being given into ANA custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070308.wdetainees0308/BNStory/National/home|first=Alex|last=Doborta|title=O'Connor issues about-face on detainees|work=The Globe and Mail|date=8 March 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On March 13, O'Connor traveled to [[Kandahar]] to meet with Abdul Noorzai of the [[Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission]].  He wanted to "look the man in the eyes", and gain assurances that detainees were being supervised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070313.woconnor0313/BNStory/Afghanistan/|first=Joe|last=Friesen|title=O'Connor fails to meet Afghan watchdog|work=The Globe and Mail|date=13 March 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27 }}{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On March 19, O'Connor apologised for previously misleading the House on the Red Cross issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/19/afghanaplogy.html|title=O'Connor sorry for misinforming House on Afghan detainees|publisher=CBC News|date=19 March 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On March 21, in response to continued criticism of O'Connor's earlier actions, Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] intervened in the issue, stating in the House that "I can understand the passion that the leader of the Opposition and members of his party feel for the Taliban prisoners... I just wish occasionally they would show the same passion for Canadian soldiers." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/21/harper-attack.html|title=Liberals furious at Harper's Taliban accusation|publisher=CBC News|date=21 March 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On April 23, 2007, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' published interviews with 30 men who claimed they were "beaten, starved, frozen and choked after they were handed over to Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070423.DETAINEE23/TPStory/?query=From+Canadian+custody+into+cruel+hands|title=From Canadian custody into cruel hands|first=Graeme|last=Smith|work=The Globe and Mail|date=23 April 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This prompted intense questioning by all opposition parties, including demands for a new agreement with Afghan authorities and unanimous demands for O'Connor's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/04/23/afghan-torture.html|title=Latest Afghan abuse claims spark cries for O'Connor to resign|publisher=CBC News|date=23 April 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/070423/n042329A.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723222932/http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/070423/n042329A.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 July 2012|title=Pressure mounts on Conservatives to change Afghan prisoner agreement|publisher=CBC News|date=23 April 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6581322,00.html|title=Canada to Probe Afghan Abuse Allegations|work=The Guardian|date=24 April 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27 | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On April 26, [[Michael Byers (Canadian professor)|Michael Byers]] and [[William Schabas]] announced they had issued a request to the [[International Criminal Court]] to investigate "possible war crimes" by Gordon O'Connor and General [[Rick Hillier]], Chief of the Defence Staff, over the detainee-transfer issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070426.DETAINEESUIT26/TPStory/TPInternational/Asia/|title=ICC urged to probe transfer|work=The Globe and Mail|first=Alan|last=Freeman|date=26 April 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Globe and Mail'' quoted an anonymous Conservative source about why Harper was not planning to dismiss O'Connor despite his mistakes with the file: "If it's interpreted as us wavering, or any weakening of resolve that somehow we're on the wrong course, those questions would get asked...

*In Parliament, Stephen Harper stated that there was "no evidence that access is blocked to the prisons" and said that Afghan authorities had agreed to "formalize that agreement so there is no potential misunderstanding", suggesting the agreement had yet to be settled.

*On April 30, [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] Secretary General [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] announced that the Afghan government was to launch an inquiry about the fate of detainees.  In Parliament, House Leader [[Peter Van Loan]] questioned the existence of torture, saying "we have yet to see one specific allegation of torture ...

*On October 6, 2009, the lawyer for Canadian diplomat, [[Richard Colvin (diplomat)|Richard Colvin]] (called to testify at a hearing into allegations of Afghan prison torture) said that the Conservative government was trying to keep her client silent. In a letter sent to the Canadian [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]] and obtained by [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]], lawyer Lori Bokenfohr said the government invoked the national security order in response to [[Richard Colvin (diplomat)|Richard Colvin]]'s decision to co-operate with the [[Military Police Complaints Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/10/06/diplomat-testimony-afghan.html|title= Government trying to muzzle diplomat: lawyer |date=October 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 18, 2009, allegations regarding the treatment of Taliban prisoners captured by Canadian forces in Afghanistan resurfaced in parliamentary testimony by [[Richard Colvin (Canadian)|Richard Colvin]], the second highest-ranked member of Canada’s diplomatic service in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2007. Liberal MPs demanded an independent public inquiry to get to the bottom of the torture scandal, "in order to restore Canada's human rights record and trust in government". "It's now clear that Canadian diplomat Richard Colvin was muzzled with every effort made to prevent him from documenting his findings or report them publicly – but the story on why this was covered up still has yet to be told", said Liberal Foreign Affairs Critic [[Bob Rae]]. Liberal MP [[Irwin Cotler]] said Canada "acted responsibly" when the previous Liberal government called an inquiry into the deportation and torture of [[Maher Arar]] in a Syrian prison: this Canadian citizen was passing through New York from a vacation in Tunisia seven years ago when U.S. officials held him, wrongly accused him of links with Al Qaeda and sent him to Syria, where he was jailed for months and regularly beaten. "Getting to the bottom of what happened to Mr. Arar was important to Canadians in order to restore their confidence in their government and the administration of justice. It was important to the international community to know that we would not be part of any cover up". Liberal Defence Critic [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] stated that the Conservatives' "complicity" undermines Canada's mission to bring democracy and respect for the rule of law to Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberal.ca/en/newsroom/media-releases/16938_public-inquiry-needed-to-get-to-bottom-of-afghan-torture-scandal "Public inquiry needed to get to bottom of Afghan torture scandal"] November 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 19, 2009, the Canadian government dismissed calls for a public inquiry. "There has not been a single, solitary proven allegation of abuse involving a transferred Taliban prisoner by Canadian forces" MacKay said in the House of Commons. MacKay painted Colvin as having been "duped" by the Taliban and suggested not to accept the word of prisoners "who throw acid in the face of schoolgirls". Also he said he did not know about Colvin's allegations. Ottawa University law professor [[Amir Attaran]] said MacKay had to explain how he could not have known about the 17 reports that Colvin wrote 17 reports with more than 70 cc's that he sent to colleagues in Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2009/11/19/afghanistan-torture-colvin-inquiry.html "Tories reject call for Afghan torture inquiry - No proof detainees were tortured, defence minister says"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 4, 2009, the Liberals accused the government to "stonewall" the requests for a public inquiry, despite mounting evidence that the Conservative government refused to act on warnings of torture:

: 1. The [[International Red Cross]] warned Canada of torture and complained of notification delays. In May and June 2006, Richard Colvin and at least two other Canadian officials were twice warned by the Red Cross that torture was a serious risk in Afghan prisons. The Red Cross also complained that it took up to two months for Canada to report prisoner transfers to them.

: 2. The government pressured soldiers to transfer detainees faster. Top Canadian commanders in Kandahar testified to the [[Military Police Complaints Commission]] that officials in Ottawa pressured them to transfer detainees before proper medical treatment or paperwork could be administered.

: 3. Afghan intelligence stopped accepting Canadian detainees due to a lack of evidence. Complaints about the quality of evidence provided by Canadian troops left Afghan prosecutors with little admissible evidence to use in judicial proceedings, and resulted in a halt of detainee transfers at their request.

: 4. Many Canadian transferred detainees were not high-value Taliban targets. A Canadian commander in Afghanistan told the Military Police Complaints Commission that they were "detaining the local yokels and handing them off".

: 5. In spring 2007, Richard Colvin told the Prime Minister’s advisor for Afghanistan, [[David Mulroney]], that the [[Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission]] charged with monitoring Canadian-transferred detainees had little or no access to the Kandahar prison run by the [[National Directorate of Security]] – contrary to assurances provided by then-Defence Minister [[Gordon O'Connor]].

: 6. [[Linda Garwood-Filbert]], a Corrections Canada official who visited Afghan prisons, did not consider the discovery of a braided electrical cable in the office of the director of Afghan investigations as evidence of torture.

: 7. The government only provided incomplete and redacted documents to members of the [[Canadian House of Commons Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan]], refusing to provide unredacted copies of Richard Colvin’s reports, detainee memos, and the annual human rights report of the Canadian Embassy in Afghanistan.

: 8. Canadian officials did not investigate torture allegations. Eight months after the new detainee agreement was put in place, Canadian official [[Kerry Buck]] said in a court document, "It is not our role to determine the credibility of the allegations, to determine the veracity of the allegations. We don't investigate those allegations."

: 9. The [[International Criminal Court]] would examine the treatment of Afghan prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberal.ca/en/newsroom/media-releases/17058_just-the-facts-this-weeks-afghan-detainee-revelations "Just the facts: This week's Afghan detainee revelations", December 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

* On December 5, 2009, Defense Minister Peter MacKay said Canada was "trying to change the culture" in Afghanistan. When asked why it took more than a year to act on allegations of torture, MacKay said to the press that the government moved as fast as they could. "We acted almost immediately. In fact, upon taking government it became quite clear there were deficiencies in the arrangement of how we transfer detainees".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paherald.sk.ca/News/Local/2009-12-05/article-206902/Building-human-rights-in-Afghanistan-takes-time:-MacKay/1 "Building human rights in Afghanistan takes time: MacKay"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 9, 2009, after the release of a letter signed by 23 ex-ambassadors that condemned Conservative attempts to discredit Colvin, the NDP demanded the resignation of Defence Minister Peter MacKay's, accusing him of misleading the House of Commons over what the government knew about the possible torture and what it did about the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/afghanmission/article/736373--mackay-has-to-go-ndp-says "MacKay has to go, NDP says - Ex-ambassadors' letter fuels furor over torture"]&lt;/ref&gt; That number later climbed to 125 retired ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2009/12/13/12140696-qmi.html "Politicians, civil servants in showdown"]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, 2009, after testifying the day prior that one particular abused detainee was never in Canadian Forces custody, General [[Walter Natynczyk]] corrected himself upon receiving new information showing the contrary.

* On December 23, 2009, Colvin accused [[David Mulroney]], his former superior at Foreign Affairs in Ottawa and presently Canada's ambassador to China, of misinforming the parliamentary committee and high-ranking defence officers of negligence in his written rebuttal of officials who testified against his allegations. He tabled his written response at a special House of Commons committee on the detainees affair to clarify "inaccurate or incomplete" evidence by top officials whose testimony has been cited by Defence Minister Peter MacKay to characterize him Colvin as a lone witness whose allegations "lack credibility". Mulroney called Colvin's allegations "speculation," denied that his entreaties about torture had been ignored at top levels in Ottawa and he told parliamentarians that Canadian reports from Afghanistan were edited only to remove opinion or non-fact-based information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/news/story.html?id=2349027 "Colvin says he was obligated to bring Afghan detainee torture to light"]&lt;/ref&gt;

If his motion is successful it could see the [[List of Sergeants-at-Arms of the Canadian House of Commons|Commons sergeant-at-arms]] using a never-before-exercised power to seize the documents which Parliament requested in December, 2009. He also wrote to the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] warning that she may need to wade into the fray if the government decides to keep flouting the December 2009 Parliamentary order to produce documents related to the treatment of Afghan detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/afghanmission/article/774225--battle-looms-over-afghan-files|title=Battle looms over Afghan files |author= Susan Delacourt|date=March 3, 2010 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 5, 2010, Justice Minister [[Rob Nicholson]]  announced to the House of Commons that former Supreme Court of Canada judge [[Frank Iacobucci]] was appointed to determine if any "injurious" effects would result from making the Afghan detainee documents public. The opposition expressed deep disappointment with the decision, saying that they did not doubt the competence of the former justice, but believed that it was nothing more than another way to delay the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/03/05/nat-detainee-review.html|title=Ottawa calls for review of detainee documents|date=March 5, 2010|work=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Evan Solomon]], Liberal and NDP defence critics [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] and [[Jack Harris (Newfoundland and Labrador politician)|Jack Harris]], respectively, repeated that Parliament has the constitutional right to review unredacted documents, and that there are systems in place to decide what is and is not appropriate to release to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video| people = [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] and [[Jack Harris (Newfoundland and Labrador politician)|Jack Harris]]  | title = ''[[Power &amp; Politics]]'' - [http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/News/TV_Shows/Power_&amp;_Politics_with_Evan_Solomon/ID=1433038988 Contempt of Parliament?] | medium = Television| publisher = [[CBC News]]  | date = 5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also on March 5, a second, more serious issue arose when the [[CBC News]] published the following statement "Until now, the controversy has centred on whether the government turned a blind eye to abuse of Afghan detainees. However, [ [[University of Ottawa]] law professor [[Amir Attaran]] ] said the full versions of the documents show that Canada went even further in intentionally handing over prisoners to torturers."&lt;ref name="If"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/03/05/afghan-attaran005.html|title=Canada wanted Afghan prisoners tortured: lawyer|date=March 5, 2010|work=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If the allegation is true, such actions would constitute a [[war crime]], said Attaran, who has been digging deep into the issue and told CBC News he has seen uncensored versions of government documents released last year."&lt;ref name="If"/&gt;
* On March 18, the three opposition parties united in a bid to force the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] to let them look at uncensored documents on the Afghan detainees affair or face parliamentary contempt proceedings. [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada]] [[Peter Milliken]] said he would rule on the potential breach of privilege after giving ministers a chance to respond. Toronto Liberal [[Derek Lee (politician)|Derek Lee]], an expert on parliamentary rights, said the request from Parliament was based on "340 years of bedrock constitutional history" in which Parliament has the right to keep the government accountable and to summon documents and witnesses to perform its functions. "There are no other persons who can come into this House to protect the constitutional foundations of this country, only the 308 persons here," Lee said, referring to MPs. "So if we do not stand up for our Parliament's role on behalf of Canadians, then there is no one else out there to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=Showdown looms over detainee documents; Tories ignore MPs' motion |author= Juliet O'Neill|date=March 19, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Canwest News Service]], The Province |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/opposition-asserts-supremacy-of-parliament-in-afghan-detainee-issue/article1505189/|title=Opposition asserts supremacy of Parliament in Afghan detainee issue  |author=Daniel Leblanc  |date=March 18–19, 2010 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was after ten all-party meetings (50 days) since the Speaker's April 27, 2010 ruling, and was 36 days after the Speaker's deadline. Even then, it was still not agreed to by all political parties: the NDP refused to endorse the deal.&lt;ref name = "Memo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The NDP defended itself against false accusations that it refused to submit to the agreement's provisions for national security: According to NDP MP [[Jack Harris (Newfoundland and Labrador politician)|Jack Harris]], the NDP was ready to sign an agreement that met the following conditions, as he states in this quote: "As I indicated in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the NDP was fully willing to sign an agreement that "provides for the protection of national security, provides for ensuring confidentiality, provides for an oath to be taken by members of the committee," as well as reporting and accountability." {{cite web |url=https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/letters/ready+sign/3169005/story.html |title=NDP ready to sign |author= [[Jack Harris (Newfoundland and Labrador politician)|Jack Harris]]|date= |work=Letters to the Editor |publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]] |accessdate=16 June 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also disagreement over whether the Speaker of the House had made unanimity a requirement in order for the deal to exist.

[[File:Tom Miller.jpg|thumb|right|Tom Miller (photographer: Jay Rochlin)]]

'''Tom Miller''' (born August 11, 1947 in [[Washington, D.C.]]) is an American author primarily known for [[travel literature]]. His ten books include ''The Panama Hat Trail'', ''On the Border'', ''Trading with the Enemy'', and ''Jack Ruby's Kitchen Sink'' (later rereleased as ''Revenge of the Saguaro''). He has written articles for the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|The Smithsonian]]'', ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Crawdaddy!|Crawdaddy]]'' and many other magazines.&lt;ref name="rolfpotts"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Miller's childhood was full of reading.&lt;ref name="globecorner"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.globecorner.com/a/1656.html
|author=Globe Corner Bookstore
|title=Tom Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family read three newspapers daily, and the bookshelves of his home were always full. His earliest travels were to [[Camp Catawba]], a summer boys' camp in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]]. He wrote for his high school newspaper, and by his fifth and final semester of college, was editor-in-chief of the school's weekly paper. But this was the late 1960s, and the [[Underground press|underground, anti-war press]] had for him a cultural and political appeal the college presses lacked. He continued through the early 1970s editing and writing underground pamphlets, papers, and flyers.&lt;ref name="rolfpotts"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1969 he moved to [[Tucson, Arizona]]. He tried working odd jobs—selling encyclopedias door-to-door and working as a janitor, both jobs lasting four weeks—but focused on living cheaply and writing for whatever money he could earn. In the late sixties and early 1970s Miller continued to write for underground and alternative periodicals such as the Austin Rag, the [[Washington Free Press]], [[Dallas Notes]], Dallas Iconoclast, the Albuquerque Current, Liberation News Service, the Liberated Guardian, and many other outlets. He soon wrote for “sea level” publications, as his colleague [[Andrew Kopkind]] called them – Fusion, Creem, [[Rolling Stone]], and the like.&lt;ref name="ago"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/uoa/UAMS377.xml;query=Tom%20miller;brand=default/
|author=Arizona Archives Online - Tom Miller
|title=Tom Miller papers}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first break would come after writing a short piece for ''SunDance'' magazine that an editor at ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' happened to read. He had been paid $15 to write the article; the editor suggested his magazine would have paid $750 for the same work. Soon he would find his first mainstream work with them.

In 1971 the Internal Security Division of the U.S. Justice Department probing the anti-Vietnam war protests, subpoenaed Miller to testify before a grand jury. He refused to enter the grand jury room, claiming First Amendment rights that as a journalist, even free-lance for the underground press, to testify in secret would place a cloak of suspicion over him and affect his ability to gather news. Many journalists wrote affidavits on his behalf. US District Court Judge William Frey ruled on Miller’s behalf,&lt;ref&gt;US District Court for the District of Arizona, in the matter of Thomas Lawrence Miller, Grand Jury witness, Misc. 154, August 26, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that Miller “appears to be a member of the group about which he reports rather than an objective reporter. He occupies a dual capacity. However…” The Justice Department appealed the decision and refused to state its reason for subpoenaing Miller. Eventually the grand jury expired and the case ended with Miller free and clear of its purpose.

An offbeat 1975 article Miller wrote for ''[[Crawdaddy!|Crawdaddy]]'' about the [[Kennedy Assassination]] was read by a literary agent who insisted it could be expanded into a full-length book.&lt;ref name="rolfpotts"/&gt; This became ''The Assassination Please Almanac'', his first book, whose cover blurb called it "a consumer's guide to conspiracy theories."

Life on the southern U.S. border inspired his first travel book: ''On the Border: Portraits of America's Southwestern Frontier.'' He travelled the full 2,000 mile length of the [[United States–Mexico border]] interviewing its denizens. The book was published in 1981. For approximately six years (1979-1985) Miller worked as a stringer for the National Desk of the New York Times, filing stories on conflict and culture in the Southwest borderlands.

His 1986 travelogue, ''The Panama Hat Trail'' follows the making and marketing of a (misnomered) [[Panama hat]] from the straw fields of [[Ecuador]] and its weaving by Indian peasants, to its finishing in a North American hat factory, and finally to a customer in a San Diego retail hat shop.

His book ''Jack Ruby’s Kitchen Sink: Offbeat Portraits of America’s Southwest'', won the 2000 [[Lowell Thomas]] Award for "Best Travel Book of the Year," given by the Society of American Travel Writers Foundation (The book was later retitled ''Revenge of the Saguaro'').

In 1987 he first visited [[Cuba]] and moved to that Caribbean Island for eight months in the summer of 1990. In 1992 his experiences there became the book, ''Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba.'' He wrote many articles about Cuba for a wide range of publications. As co-founder and co-director of Writers of the Americas (2000-2002) Miller arranged for approximately 15 American writers to mix with a like number of Cuban writers in Havana in somewhat of a literary détente. In 2008 he began leading annual one-week Literary Havana tours, introducing Americans to Cuba’s literary personalities and activities.&lt;ref name="travelerstales"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Travelers' Tales Cuba True Stories Edited by Tom Miller (review)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller conceived and edited the book ''How I Learned English: 55 Accomplished Latinos Recall Lessons in Language and Life,'' published simultaneously in Spanish in 2007.

He has also edited anthologies about Cuba and the Mexican border and was a major contributor to the 4-volume ''Encyclopedia Latina''. His collection of over 80 versions of [[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]] led to his Rhino Records compilation ''The Best of La Bamba''.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune"&gt;{{cite web

The [[University of Arizona]] Library acquired Miller's archives and in 2004 mounted a major exhibit of his papers.&lt;ref name="voiceedge"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://speccoll.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/voice-edge/
|author=Voice from the Edge
|title=http://speccoll.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/voice-edge}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as adjunct research associate at the University of Arizona’s Latin American Area Center since 1990,&lt;ref name="wkconline"&gt;{{cite web

In 2008 the City of [[Quito]], at a public ceremony in its Centro Historico, proclaimed Miller “Un Huésped Ilustre” (An Illustrious Guest) for his literary contributions to Ecuador. Miller is a member of the Thornton Wilder Society and the Cervantes Society of America, as well as The Authors Guild. One of Miller's siblings is [[Charles A. Miller (political scientist)|Charles A. Miller]] (1937), Professor Emeritus of Politics and American Studies, [[Lake Forest College]].

In 2015 he was a guest travel writing workshop leader at the Port Townsend (Washington) Writers Conference.

In 2016, the Cultural Ministry of Mexico selected ''Revenge of the Saguaro: Portraits of America’s Southwestern Frontier'' to be translated into Spanish by the Trilce Publishing Company.

In addition to leading land-based study tours of Cuba, in 2017 Miller was the on-board lecturer on the Sea Mist, a 200 passenger cruise ship that circumnavigated the island, stopping at various port cities during the ten day journey.

In the fall of 2017 a Festschrift (literary tribute) was published in Miller’s honor, with essays about his work and writing style.

Miller was the focus of a panel entitled “Tom Miller, Hot and Cold” at the 2018 Tucson Festival of Books.

==Quotes on Writing==
"Great travel writing consists of equal parts curiosity, vulnerability and vocabulary. It is not a terrain for know-it-alls or the indecisive. The best of the genre can simply be an elegant natural history essay, a nicely writ sports piece, or a well-turned profile of a bar band and its music. A well-grounded sense of place is the challenge for the writer. We observe, we calculate, we inquire, we look for a link between what we already know and what we're about to learn. The finest travel writing describes what's going on when nobody's looking." &lt;ref name="tucsonweekly"&gt;{{cite web

"No camera, no recording device, no laptop, none of this palm pilot nonsense or a cell phone. Paper and pencil, a book, maybe a bilingual dictionary. Anything beyond that (a) can be stolen, and (b) intimidates people you encounter. The more double-A batteries you carry, the more you distance yourself from the people you're writing about."&lt;ref name="rolfpotts"/&gt;

'''Western law''' refers to the [[Law|legal traditions]] of [[Western culture]].  Western culture has an idea of the importance of [[law]] which has its roots in both [[Roman law]] and [[canon law]].  As Western culture has a [[Graeco-Roman]] [[Classics|Classical]] and [[Renaissance]] cultural influence, so does its legal systems.

==History==
The rediscovery of the [[Roman law|Justinian Code]] in the early 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. Eventually, it was only in the [[Catholic]] or [[Franks|Frankish]] west, that [[Roman law]] became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based. Its influence can be traced to this day in all Western legal systems (although in different manners and to different extents in the [[common law|common]] (Anglo-American) and the [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] (continental European) legal traditions).  

The study of [[canon law]], the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis of the refounding of Western legal scholarship.   The ideas of [[civil rights]], [[social equality|equality]] before the [[law]], [[equality of women]],  [[procedural justice]], and [[democracy]] as the ideal form of [[society]], and were principles which formed the basis of modern [[Western culture]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Western legal culture==
Western [[legal culture]] is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include [[corporations]], [[contracts]], [[Estate (law)|estates]], rights and powers to name a few. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;J.C. Smith (1968) ‘The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law' The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;   

As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on [[language]] and [[symbols]] and any attempt to analyse non western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;  So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group's culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level. Basically the latter group represents primacy of prejudices, myths and taboo as viable means to conduct human society.

'''William Michael Rossetti''' (25 September 1829 &amp;ndash; 5 February 1919) was an English writer and critic.

==Biography==
Born in London, he was a son of immigrant Italian scholar [[Gabriele Rossetti]] and his wife [[Frances Polidori|Frances Rossetti ''née'' Polidori]], and the brother of [[Maria Francesca Rossetti]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Christina Rossetti|Christina Georgina Rossetti]].

He was one of the seven founder members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848, and became the movement's unofficial organizer and bibliographer. He edited the Brotherhood's literary magazine ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'' which published four issues in 1850 and wrote the poetry reviews for it.

It was William Michael Rossetti who recorded the aims of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood at their founding meeting in September 1848:

#To have genuine ideas to express;
#To study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
#To sympathize with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading and learned by rote;
#And most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.&lt;ref&gt;Rossetti, William Michael. &lt;em&gt;Dante Gabriel Rossetti. His Family-Letters with a Memoir&lt;/em&gt;. (London: Ellis, 1895), p. 135. (http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/pr5246.a43.rad.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rossetti worked full-time as a civil servant, he maintained a prolific output of criticism and biography across a range of interests from [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Algernon Swinburne]] to [[James McNeill Whistler]]. He edited the diaries of his maternal uncle [[John Polidori|John William Polidori]] (author of ''[[The Vampyre]]'' and physician to [[Lord Byron]]), a comprehensive biography of D. G. Rossetti, and edited the collected works of D. G. Rossetti and Christina Rossetti.

Rossetti edited the first British edition of the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]], which was published in 1868; however, this edition was [[bowdlerize]]d.&lt;ref name="leavesofgrassessays"&gt;{{Citation

In 1874 he married [[Lucy Madox Brown]], daughter of the painter [[Ford Madox Brown]]. They honeymooned in France and Italy. Their first child, [[Olivia Rossetti Agresti|Olivia Frances Madox]], was born in September 1875, and her birth was celebrated in an ode of Swinburne's. A son, Gabriel Arthur, was born in February 1877, followed by another daughter, Helen Maria, in November 1879, and twins, Mary Elizabeth and Michael Ford, in April 1881. Their son Michael died in infancy. Rossetti and his wife did not have the children baptized, nor were they raised in a Christian household. The children were schooled at home by their mother and governesses. In 1897, Olivia married an Italian anarchist refugee, Antonio Agresti. They later moved to Italy, where Olivia became a translator and writer. After she was widowed in 1926, she became an associate of [[Ezra Pound]], and the two corresponded frequently.

Gabriel Arthur, known as Arthur to the family, became a scientist, married Dora Lewis, and had several children. Helen became a painter of miniatures, and in 1903 married Gastone Angeli. He was in fragile health and died only a few months later. Helen gave birth to his posthumous daughter, Imogen Lucy, in 1904.

William Michael Rossetti was a major contributor to the 1911 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''; his contributions on artistic subjects were criticised by many reviewers at the time and since, as showing little evidence of having absorbed the mounting body of work by academic [[art historian]]s, mostly writing in German. Below is a quotation from his article on [[Fra Angelico]] demonstrating his literary and art-historical style.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "pietistic" quality of Fra Angelico's work is in fact its predominant characteristic. The faces of his figures have an air of rapt suavity, devotional fervency and beaming esoteric consciousness, which is intensely attractive to some minds ... the faces becoming sleek and prim, with a smirk of sexless religiosity which hardly eludes the artificial or even the hypocritical; because of this, there are some who are not moved by his work. Even so, Fra Angelico is a notable artist within his sphere... . &lt;ref&gt;Rossetti, William Michael. "Angelico, Fra". 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
