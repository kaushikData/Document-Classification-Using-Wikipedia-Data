'''Albert Ludvig Lindsay von Julin''' (2 August 1871 — 8 May 1944) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Julin was born in [[Pohja]] to an industrial family. After his studies he spent for few years gaining work experience in [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus]], after which he returned in Finland to manage his family business, the [[Fiskars]] company. Julin led the company for almost 40 years growing it one of the largest companies of Finland.

Julin had also a significant role at creating the Finnish [[employers' association]]s. He took part in the last [[Diet of Finland]] in 1904–1905 and in local politics in Pohja.

== Early life and studies ==
Julin was born in [[Fiskars, Finland|Fiskars]], [[Pohja]]; his parents were [[Emil Lindsay von Julin]], manager and co-owner of the local [[Fiskars]] [[ironworks]], and Hildur [[née]] Kistner. Julin family was an influential Finnish industrialist family. He graduated in 1890 in private Finland-Swedish [[Lyceum#Finland|reallyceum]] in [[Hamina]]. Julin went to study in Faculty of Chemistry in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Finnish Polytechnical Institute]] and he graduated [[engineer]] in 1894. He continued his studies in [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and graduated as mining engineer in 1895. Subsequently, Julin travelled around Europe visiting number of mining and engineering companies. He worked for [[Branobel]] in [[Baku]], [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus]] in 1896–1900.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

== Fiskars ==
Julin returned to Finland in 1900 and became engineer in Fiskars. In 1904 he was appointed managing director and in 1906 he became the company general director. Julin invested on the premises and took over a number of companies, such as Billnäs Bruks, Tyko Bruks, Inha Bruks and Finska Bult. The subsidiaries continued operation as independent units. By year 1920 Fiskars had regained its position as a significant company, being the tenth largest company of the newly independent Finland and the second largest [[engineering]] company after the [[VR Group|State Railways]] Engineering Works.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

Julin managed Fiskars for almost 40 years, until 1942. As a manager he was an old-school industrialist who was against [[labourism]]; however, he was respected as a manager and negotiation partner by his employees. Albert Lindsay von Julin was the last director of the company from the Julin family.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

== Organisational activities ==
Julin was founding member of the 1903 created Finnish Engineering Industry Employers' Association,&lt;!-- Suomen Metalliteollisuuden työnantajaliitto  --&gt; and he was one of the employers' leaders in the [[industrial action]]s which emerged in the early 20th century. In 1908 he took part in founding the Finnish Engineering Industry Bureau&lt;!-- Suomen Metalliteollisuuskonttori --&gt; and later the Finnish Industry Bureau. Julin was involved in creation of Finnish Engineering Industry Association&lt;!-- Suomen Metalliteollisuusyhdistys--&gt; and in 1921 formed Finnish Industry Federation;&lt;!-- Suomen Teollisuusliitto --&gt; he was a long-term member in the both organisations.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

== Political career ==
Julin was municipality council member in Pohja and supported the local folk college. He took part in the last [[Diet of Finland]] in 1905–1906 as member of the [[Finnish nobility|nobility]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Julin was married to Elin Constance née Blomberg. The couple had son Albert von Julin who died at young age during the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918 as a victim of [[Red Terror (Finland)|red terror]],&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt; and daughter Maggie.&lt;ref name="Zilliacus: s.63-81"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zilliacus |first=Benedict |year=1984 |chapter= »Appelassa» |title=Wilhelm Wahlforss |language=Finnish |others=Translated from Swedish by Riitta Valajärvi |location=Porvoo |publisher=Oy Wärtsilä Ab |pages=63–81 |isbn=951-99541-8-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julin is characterised as a warm and social person who had a large circle of friends. His social character led to increased alcohol intake which gave him nickname ''[[Punsch|Punschen]]''. By time Julin's drinking started to effect on his work as Fiskars manager.&lt;ref name="Zilliacus: s.63-81"/&gt;

==Organization==

ANAN was founded on 1 January 1979 and was incorporated on 28 September 1983. The Association was chartered on 25 August 1993 by Decree 76 of 1993.&lt;ref name=paccount20101118/&gt;
The governing council of ANAN is elected by its members.
It includes representatives of the Auditors General of the Federation, State and Local Government, and representatives of universities and polytechnics.&lt;ref name=cipfa201103/&gt;

Before being admitted to ANAN members must undertake academic studies, including one year at ANAN’s Nigerian College of Accountancy, followed by a two-year practical accountant-in-training program, leading to qualification as a [[Certified National Accountant]].
ANAN members must comply with its Professional Code of Conduct, which complies with [[International Federation of Accountants]] requirements.&lt;ref name=cipfa201103/&gt;
As of December 2007 ANAN had total membership of 10,260.&lt;ref name=paccount20101118/&gt;
By December 2010 membership had grown to 16,207.&lt;ref name=DChampion20110518/&gt;



ANAN was admitted as a member of the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria on 7 December 2010.&lt;ref name=DChampion20110518/&gt;
ANAN is also a member of the [[Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria]] (FRCN), which sets accounting standards for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Both ANAN and ICAN nominate two members to the NASB board.&lt;ref name=cipfa201103/&gt;

ANAN is an institutional member of the [[International Association for Accounting Education &amp; Research]] (IAAER).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Both ANAN and ICAN work with the [[United Kingdom]]-based [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy]] (CIPFA) to promote best practices in the profession.
As of March 2011, ANAN had applied to become a member of the [[Association of Accountancy Bodies in West Africa]] (ABWA).,&lt;ref name=cipfa201103/&gt; now listed as Council member of ABWA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abwa-online.org/council%20members ANAN listed as Council member of ABWA]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational activities==

Both ANAN and its rival ICAN, as well as the CITN ([[Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria]]), have been criticized for not providing enough training to members at subsidized rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However, ANAN operates a training school for accountants in [[Jos]], [[Plateau State]].&lt;ref name=Odiakose20091206/&gt;
At a ceremony in March 2006 the President of ANAN, Professor E. R. Iwok, laid the foundation stone of an ultra-modern auditorium for the [[Nigerian College of Accountancy]]. 
He said that ANAN planned to build the leading accountancy campus in Africa and to make Jos the Mecca of the accountancy profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As of March 2011 the college, which was attracting growing numbers of students from other countries in Africa, was still operating out of temporary facilities.
The only buildings completed at the permanent site were two large examination halls with capacity of 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Competing organizations==

In its charter, the government gave ANAN the authority needed to compete with ICAN. By 1994 the two organizations were fighting for control of the Chartered Accountants profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2002 ICAN applied to the courts to disqualify and/or bar Mr Clement Akpamgbo from representing ANAN, and the matter was referred to a lower court. ANAN appealed the decision, but the appeal was dismissed for lack of merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In November 2007 a Federal High Court in [[Lagos]] dismissed a suit by ICAN requesting the court to declare that the decree establishing ANAN was void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In March 2009, ANAN President Dr Samuel Nzekwe rejected an attempt by ICAN to set auditing standards for its members.
He said that the Nigerian Accounting Standards Board (NASB) Act 2003 said that only the board could set standards for the accounting profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In June 2010 Mr. Godson Nnadi, Executive Secretary of Nigeria Accounting Standards Board, spoke in favor of a new body to set accounting and auditing standards for Nigeria and other African nations. The new body would be independent of both ANAN and ICAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In May 2008 the House of Representatives rejected a bill to establish the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants of Nigeria (CIMA) as an alternative to both the ANAN and ICAN. The House was concerned about proliferation of accounting bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In December 2009 were delays in passage by the [[Senate of Nigeria|Senate]] of bills on the Institute of Chartered Public Accountants (CPA) and the Chartered Institute of Management and Cost Accountants (CIMCA).&lt;ref name=Odiakose20091206/&gt;
The bills had been approved by both houses during the administration of President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], but he had failed to sign them into law before the end of his term.  As a result, President [[Umaru Yar'Adua]] had to resubmit the bills when he took office in 2007.&lt;ref name=Odiakose20100311/&gt;
ANAN did not object to the new organizations but ICAN expressed concerns on the grounds of proliferation.&lt;ref name=Odiakose20091206/&gt;

In May 2012, ICAN President Prof. Francis Ojaide, has said the body and the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria have smoothed their relationship for the benefit of the nation’s economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==News events==

Speaking in August 2009, the ANAN President Chief (Mrs). Iyamide Gafar criticized the recent dismissal of the heads of five banks as being selective, with just five scapegoats. Saying that the problems were more widespread, she also advocated more frequent rotation of accountants and auditors between banks to prevent them from getting too close to management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In September 2009 it was alleged that the Comptroller General of the Nigerian Customs Service, Abdullahi Inde Dikko, had obtained a fake [[West African Examinations Council]] (WAEC) certificate dated 1980.
It was said that when ICAN discovered the fake, Dikko abandoned an attempt to become a fellow of ICAN and instead opted for ANAN membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The ANAN donated a research center to the [[Nasarawa State University]], [[Keffi]], which was opened in May 2011, possibly the first donation of this type in Nigeria.

'''Civilekonom''', literally "civil economist", is a professional title in [[Sweden]] (with corresponding titles in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], [[#See also|see below]]) which traditionally refers to an individual who holds either a [[Bachelor's degree]] or a [[Master's degree]] in business administration and economics (with a major in business administration and a minor in economics, or vice versa).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilekonomerna.se/portal/page?_pageid=34,8512339&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Civilekonomerna&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911142839/http://www.civilekonomerna.se/portal/page?_pageid=34%2C8512339&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |date=2007-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the English language usage, in Swedish, ''ekonomi'' ("economy") is commonly used as an umbrella designation for both business- and economics-related subjects.

As an academic title it was first introduced by the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] for the degree that the school offered, and was created in parallel to the already established engineering degree {{Interlanguage link multi|civilingenjör|sv}}, which etymologically is the same as the English expression [[civil engineer]].

Formally, the exam certificate for a ''civilekonom'' would say ''ekonomexamen'' ("degree in economy"), or be a general Bachelor's (''kandidat'') or Master's (''magister'') degree.

Although the title remains unprotected in Sweden and the aforementioned practice is still in use, as of 2007 a new academic degree called ''Civilekonomexamen'' (Master of Science in Business and Economics) has been introduced which can be awarded after four years of studies in business administration and economics by the following universities in Sweden:

* [[Gothenburg University]] ([[Gothenburg]])
* [[Linköping University]] ([[Linköping]])
* [[Luleå University of Technology]] ([[Luleå]])
* [[Lund University]] ([[Lund]])
* [[Stockholm University]] ([[Stockholm]])

'''Consumer privacy''' is a form of [[information privacy]] concerned with the [[legal]] and [[political]] issues arising from the interaction of the public's [[expectation of privacy]] with the collection and dissemination of [[data]] by [[Business|businesses]] or [[Merchant|merchants]]. [[Consumer]] privacy concerns date back to the first commercial [[courier]]s and bankers who enforced strong measures to protect customer privacy. In modern times, the [[ethical code]]s of most professions specify measures to protect customer privacy, including [[medical privacy]], [[client confidentiality]], and [[national security]]. Since most organizations have a competitive incentive to retain exclusive access to customer data, and since customer trust is usually a priority, many companies adopt [[security engineering]] measures to protect customer privacy.

'''Consumer privacy protection''' is the use of laws and regulations to protect individuals from privacy loss due to the failures and limitations of corporate customer privacy measures.  Corporations may be inclined to share data for commercial advantage and fail to officially recognize it as sensitive to avoid [[legal liability]] in the chance that lapses of security may occur. Modern consumer privacy law originated from telecom regulation when it was recognized that a [[telephone company]] had access to unprecedented levels of information. Customer privacy measures were seen as deficient to deal with the many hazards of corporate [[data sharing]], [[Mergers and acquisitions|corporate mergers]], [[employee turnover]], and theft of data storage devices (e.g., [[hard drives]]) that could store a large amount of data in a portable location.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
Consumer privacy concerns date back{{When|date=June 2017}} to the first commercial [[courier]]s and [[bank]]ers who enforced strong measures to protect customer privacy.{{Where|date=June 2017}} Harsh punitive measures were passed as the result of failing to keep a customer's information private. In modern times, the [[ethical code]]s of most professions specify privacy measures for the consumer of any service, including [[medical privacy]], [[client confidentiality]], and [[national security]]. These codes are particularly important in a [[carceral state]], where no privacy in any form nor limits on [[State (polity)|state]] oversight or data use exists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Modern concerns ===
'''Corporate customer privacy practices''' are approaches taken by commercial organizations to ensure that confidential customer data is not stolen or abused.  Since most organizations have strong competitive incentives to retain exclusive access to these data, and since customer trust is usually a high priority, most companies take some [[security engineering]] measures to protect customer privacy. There is also a concern that companies may sell consumer data if they have to declare bankruptcy, although it often violates their own privacy policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siam|first=Kayla|date=2017|title=Coming to a Retailer near You: Consumer Privacy Protection in Retail Bankruptcies|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=1014a1d6-916f-4c56-8b6e-a7bc3d603ba2%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#db=bth&amp;AN=124102448|journal=Emory Bankruptcy Developments Journal|volume=33|pages=487-521|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vary in effectiveness, and would not typically meet the much higher standards of [[client confidentiality]] applied by [[ethical code]]s or [[legal code]]s in [[banking]] or [[law]], nor [[patient privacy]] measures in medicine, nor rigorous [[national security]] measures in military and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence organizations]].

Since they operate for-profit, commercial organizations also cannot spend unlimited funds on precautions while remaining competitive; a commercial context tends to limit privacy measures and to motivate organizations to share data when working in partnership. The damage done by privacy loss is not measurable, nor can it be undone, and commercial organizations have little or no interest in taking unprofitable measures to drastically increase the privacy of customers. Corporations may be inclined to share data for commercial advantage and fail to officially recognize it as sensitive to avoid legal liability in the chance that lapses of security may occur. This has led to many [[moral hazard]]s and customer privacy violation incidents.

Some services—notably [[telecommunications]], including [[Internet]]—require collecting a vast array of information about users’ activities in the course of business, and may also require consultation of these data to prepare [[Invoice|bills]]. In the US and Canada, telecom data must be kept for seven years to permit dispute and consultation about phone charges. These sensitivities have led telecom regulation to be a leader in consumer privacy regulation, enforcing a high level of confidentiality on the sensitive customer communication records.

Focusing on telecom has been outmoded to some degree as other industries also gather sensitive data. Such common commercial measures as software-based [[customer relationship management]], rewards programs, and [[target market]]ing tend to drastically increase the amount of information gathered (and sometimes shared).  These very drastically increase privacy risks and have accelerated the shift to regulation, rather than relying on the corporate desire to preserve goodwill.

== Legal protection ==
 {{chronological|date=June 2017}}

Concerns have led to consumer privacy laws in most countries, especially in the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]]. Notably, among developed countries, the [[United States]] has no such law and relies on corporate customer privacy disclosed in privacy policies to ensure consumer privacy in general. Modern privacy law and regulation may be compared to parts of the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which includes a requirement for doctors to avoid mentioning the ills of patients to others—not only to protect them, but to protect their families— and also recognizes that innocent third parties can be harmed by the loss of control of sensitive personal information.

Modern consumer privacy law originated from telecom regulation when it was recognized that a [[telephone company]]—especially a [[monopoly]] (known in many nations as a [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service|PTT]])—had access to unprecedented levels of information: the direct customer's communication habits and correspondents and the data of those who shared the household. Telephone operators could frequently hear conversations—inadvertently or deliberately—and their job required them to dial the exact numbers. The data gathering required for the process of billing began to become a privacy risk as well.  Accordingly, strong rules on operator behaviour, customer confidentiality, records keeping and destruction were enforced on telephone companies in every country. Typically only police and military authorities had legal powers to [[wiretap]] or see records.  Even stricter requirements emerged for various banks' electronic records In some countries, [[financial privacy]] is a major focus of the economy, with severe criminal penalties for violating it.

==1970s==
Through the 1970s many other organizations in [[developed nation]]s began to acquire sensitive data, but there were few or no regulations in place to prevent them from sharing or abusing the data.  Customer trust and goodwill were generally thought to be sufficient in first-world countries, notably the [[United States]], to ensure the protection of truly sensitive data;  ''[[caveat emptor]]'' was applied in these situations.  But in the 1980s, smaller organizations also began to get access to computer hardware and software, and these simply did not have the procedures or personnel or expertise, nor less the time, to take rigorous measures to protect their customers.  Meanwhile, via [[target marketing]] and [[rewards programs]], companies were acquiring ever more data.

Gradually, customer privacy measures were seen as deficient to deal with the many hazards of corporate data sharing, corporate mergers, employee turnover, and theft of data storage devices (e.g., [[hard drives]]) that could store a large amount of data in a portable location. Explicit regulation of consumer privacy gained further support, especially in the [[European Union]], where each nation had laws that were incompatible (e.g., some restricted the [[Data collection|collection]], some the [[Data compilation|compilation]], and some the [[Data dissemination|dissemination of data]]); it was possible to violate privacy within the EU simply doing these things from different places in the [[European Common Market]] as it existed before 1992.

==1990s==
Through the 1990s, the proliferation of [[mobile telecom]], the introduction of [[customer relationship management]], and the use of the [[Internet]] in [[developed nation]]s brought the situation to the forefront, and most countries had to implement strong consumer privacy laws, often over the objections of business. The [[European Union]] and [[New Zealand]] passed particularly strong laws that were used as a template for more limited laws in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] and some states of the [[United States]] (where no federal law for consumer privacy exists, although there are requirements specific to banking and telecom privacy). In [[Austria]] around the 1990s, the mere mention of a client's name in a semi-public social setting was enough to earn a junior bank executive a stiff jail sentence.

==2001==
After the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks|terrorist attacks]] against the [[United States]] on [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks|September 11, 2001,]] privacy took a back-seat to [[national security]] in legislators' minds.  Accordingly, concerns of consumer privacy in the [[United States]] have tended to go unheard of as questions of citizen privacy versus the state, and the development of a [[police state]] or [[carceral state]], have occupied advocates of strong privacy measures. Whereas it may have appeared prior to 2002 that commercial organizations and the consumer data they gathered were of primary concern, it has appeared since then in most [[developed nation]]s to be much less of a concern than [[political privacy]] and [[medical privacy]] (e.g., as violated by [[biometrics]]).  Indeed, people have recently been [[No Fly List|stopped at airports]] solely due to their political views, and there appears{{Weasel inline|date=June 2017}} to be minimal public will to stop practices of this nature.

A '''corporate recovery''' is a rescue undertaken by  professional [[accountant]]s, who are trained to assist the management of a company in financial and other difficulties. This work is usually undertaken at the behest of the directors of the company and is normally undertaken by licensed [[insolvency]] practitioners.

McCormick (1808-1883) was an industrialist and inventor of the first commercially successful reaper, a horse-drawn machine to harvest wheat. He was born at the family farm (Walnut Grove) in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]] on February 15, 1809. His father experimented with a design for a mechanical reaper from around the time of Cyrus' birth. | publisher= [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070905065855/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/libraryarchives/ihc/cyrus.asp | archivedate= September 5, 2007 | deadurl= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, he and many members of his [[McCormick family|family]] became prominent residents of Chicago.

McCormick has been simplistically credited as the single inventor of the [[Reaper#Mechanical reapers in the U.S.|mechanical reaper]]. However, he was one of several designing engineers who produced successful models in the 1830s. His efforts built on more than two decades of work by his father [[Robert McCormick (Virginia)|Robert McCormick Jr.]], as well as the aid of Jo Anderson, a slave held by his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jo Anderson|url=http://www.richmond.com/special-section/black-history/article_277b0072-700a-11e2-bb3d-001a4bcf6878.html|accessdate=22 April 2015|newspaper=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also successfully developed a modern [[company]], with [[manufacturing]], [[marketing]], and a [[sales]] force to market his products.&lt;ref name="McCormick_1931"&gt;{{Harvnb|McCormick|1931}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Cyrus McCormick was born on February 15, 1809 in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia. He was the eldest of eight children born to inventor [[Robert McCormick (Virginia)|Robert McCormick Jr.]] (1780–1846) and Mary Ann "Polly" Hall (1780–1853). As Cyrus' father saw the potential of the design for a mechanical reaper, he applied for a patent to claim it as his own invention. He worked for 28 years on a horse-drawn mechanical [[reaper]] to harvest grain; however, he was never able to reproduce a reliable version.

Cyrus took up the project.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Daniel Gross]] |author2= [[Forbes|''Forbes'' Magazine]]  Staff|date=August 1997 |title=Greatest Business Stories of All Time |edition=First |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |pages= 24–32  |isbn=0-471-19653-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was aided by Jo Anderson, an [[slavery|enslaved]] African American on the McCormick [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Sluby"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patricia Carter Sluby |title= The Inventive Spirit of African Americans: Patented Ingenuity |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz-DTSXeLRYC&amp;pg=PA282 |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-96674-4 |page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few machines based on a design of [[Patrick Bell]] of Scotland (which had not been patented) were available in the United States in these years. The Bell machine was pushed by horses. The McCormick design was pulled by horses and cut the grain to one side of the team.

Cyrus McCormick held one of his first demonstrations of mechanical reaping at the nearby village of [[Steeles Tavern, Virginia]] in 1831. He claimed to have developed a final version of the reaper in 18 months. The young McCormick was granted a patent on the reaper on June 21, 1834,&lt;ref name="iles"&gt;{{Cite book |author= George Iles |year = 1912 |edition= 2nd |title = Leading American Inventors |place =New York |publisher = Henry Holt and Company| url = https://archive.org/details/leadingamericani00ilesrich |pages=276–314 |chapter= Cyrus H. McCormick }}&lt;/ref&gt; two years after having been granted a patent for a self-sharpening plow.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.com"&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Cyrus_Hall_McCormick.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; However, none were sold, because the machine could not handle varying conditions.

The McCormick family also worked together in a blacksmith/metal smelting business. The [[panic of 1837]] almost caused the family to go into bankruptcy when a partner pulled out. In 1839 McCormick started doing more public demonstrations of the reaper, but local farmers still thought the machine was unreliable. He did sell one in 1840, but none for 1841.

Using the endorsement of his father's first customer for a machine built by McPhetrich, Cyrus continuously attempted to improve the design. He finally sold seven reapers in 1842, 29 in 1843, and 50 in 1844. They were all built manually in the family farm shop. 
He received a second patent for reaper improvements on January 31, 1845.&lt;ref name="iles"/&gt;
[[File:McCormick Reaper, 1845.jpg|thumb|right |Sketch of 1845 model reaper]]

As word spread about the reaper, McCormick noticed orders arriving from farther west, where farms tended to be larger and the land flatter. While he was in Washington, DC to get his 1845 patent, he heard about a factory in [[Brockport, New York]], where he contracted to have the machines mass-produced. He also licensed several others across the country to build the reaper, but their quality often proved poor, which hurt the product's reputation.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.com"/&gt;

==Move to Chicago==
In 1847, after their father's death, Cyrus and his brother [[Leander J. McCormick|Leander]] (1819–1900) moved to Chicago, where they established a factory to build their machines. At the time, other cities in the [[midwestern United States]], such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], were more established and prosperous. Chicago had no paved streets at the time, but the city had the best water transportation from the east over the [[Great Lakes]] for his raw materials, as well as railroad connections to the farther west where his customers would be.&lt;ref name="Casson_1909"&gt;{{Harvnb|Casson|1909}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When McCormick tried to renew his patent in 1848, the [[US Patent Office]] noted that a similar machine had already been patented by [[Obed Hussey]] a few months earlier. McCormick claimed he had really invented his machine in 1831, but the renewal was denied.&lt;ref name="cheap"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Follet L. Greeno | year=1912 | title=Obed Hussey: Who, of All Inventors, Made Bread Cheap |publisher= The Rochester Herald publishing Company |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eMhHAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Manning of [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] had also received a patent for his reaper in May 1831, but at the time, Manning was evidently not defending his patent.&lt;ref name="iles"/&gt;

McCormick's brother [[William Sanderson McCormick|William]] (1815–1865) moved to Chicago in 1849, and joined the company to take care of financial affairs. The McCormick reaper sold well, partially as a result of savvy and innovative business practices.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; Their products came onto the market just as the development of railroads offered wide distribution to distant markets. McCormick developed marketing and sales techniques, developing a wide network of salesmen trained to demonstrate operation of the machines in the field, as well as to get parts quickly and repair machines in the field if necessary during crucial times in the farm year.

A company advertisement was a take-off of the ''[[Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way]]'' mural by [[Emanuel Leutze]]; it added to the title: "with McCormick Reapers in the Van."&lt;ref name="Michael Adas 2006 79"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Adas |title= Dominance by design: technological imperatives and America's civilizing mission  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yHh6gwshyKIC&amp;pg=PA79 |year=2006 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-674-01867-9 |page= 79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, McCormick traveled to London to display a reaper at the [[The Great Exhibition|Crystal Palace Exhibition]]. After his machine successfully harvested a field of green wheat while the Hussey machine failed, he won a gold medal and was admitted to the Legion of Honor. His celebration was short-lived after he learned that he had lost a court challenge to Hussey's patent.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |title= England: Closing of the Great Exhibition—The Ballon Hoax—Egyptian Railroad—Mr. McCormick's Reaping Machine |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1851/11/05/297732542.pdf |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date= November 5, 1851 |accessdate= January 18, 2011| format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal controversies and success==
Another McCormick Company competitor was [[John Henry Manny]] of [[Rockford, Illinois]].  After the [[Manny Reaper]] beat the McCormick version at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris Exposition]] of 1855, McCormick filed a lawsuit against Manny for patent infringement.&lt;ref name="lincoln"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Lincoln and the McCormick-Manny Case |author= Sarah-Eva Carlson |work= Illinois History Magazine |date= February 1995 |url= http://www.lib.niu.edu/1995/ihy950230.html |accessdate= December 26, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110316021114/http://www.lib.niu.edu/1995/ihy950230.html |archive-date= March 16, 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; McCormick demanded that Manny stop producing reapers, and pay McCormick $400,000.

The trial, originally scheduled for Chicago in September 1855, featured prominent lawyers on both sides. McCormick hired the former US Attorney General [[Reverdy Johnson]] and New York patent attorney Edward Nicholl Dickerson. Manny hired George Harding and [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. Because the trial was set to take place in Illinois, Harding hired the local Illinois lawyer [[Abraham Lincoln]]. However, the trial was moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. Manny won the case, with an opinion by the State Supreme Court Judge [[John McLean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Reports of cases argued and decided in the circuit court, Volume 6 |chapter= Cyrus H. McCormick v. John H. Manny and Others |publisher= H. W.

Stanton had objected to Lincoln's presence, referring to him as "that damned long armed ape."&lt;ref name="Goodwin"/&gt; After later being elected President, Lincoln chose Stanton as his [[Secretary of War]].&lt;ref name="Goodwin"&gt;{{cite book |author=Doris Kearns Goodwin |title=Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqjBCWV6Eu4C&amp;pg=PA173 |year=2005 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-82490-1 |pages=173–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McCormick Twine Binder 1884.jpg|thumb|McCormick [[reaper-binder|reaper and twine binder]] in 1884]]
In 1856, McCormick's factory was producing more than 4000 reapers each year, mostly sold in the Midwest and West. However, in 1861, Hussey's patent was extended but McCormick's was not. McCormick's outspoken opposition to Lincoln and the anti-slavery Republican party may not have helped his cause. McCormick decided to seek help from the US Congress to protect his patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The McCormick Reaper Patent |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/06/news/the-mccormick-reaper-patent.html |newspaper=The New York Times | date= July 6, 1861  |accessdate= January 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the factory burned down in the [[Great Chicago Fire]], but McCormick heeded his wife's advice to rebuild, and it reopened in 1873 even as McCormick's health declined, so she took a greater role in the family's business as well as philanthropic affairs. In 1879, brother Leander changed the company's name from "Cyrus H. McCormick and Brothers" to "McCormick Harvesting Machine Company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The McCormick Family and their Mechanical Reaper |url= http://www.astro.virginia.edu/research/observatories/26inch/history/reaper.php |publisher= Leander McCormick Observatory Museum |accessdate= December 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to acknowledge the contributions of others in the family to the reaper "invention" and company, especially their father.&lt;ref name="Sluby"/&gt;

==Family relationships==

 {{McCormick Chicago family tree}}

==Activism==
McCormick had always been a devout [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian]], as well as advocate of [[Christianity|Christian]] unity. He also valued and demonstrated in his life the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] traits of self-denial, sobriety, thriftiness, efficiency, and morality. He believed feeding the world, made easier by the reaper, was part of his religious mission in life.

A lifelong Democrat, before the [[American Civil War]], McCormick had published editorials in his newspapers, ''[[The Chicago Times]]'' and ''[[Chicago Herald (1881–95)|Herald]]'', calling for reconciliation between the national sections. His views, however, were unpopular in his adopted home town. Although his invention helped feed Union troops, McCormick believed the Confederacy would not be defeated and he and his wife traveled extensively in Europe during the war. McCormick unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Democrat with a peace-now platform in 1864, and was soundly defeated. He also proposed a peace plan to include a Board of Arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Casson |first1=Herbert Newton |title=Cyrus Hall McCormick His Life and Work |date=2005 |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |isbn=9781596051201 |page=167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oultaqE-vUC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, McCormick helped found the Mississippi Valley Society, with a mission to promoted New Orleans and Mississippi ports for European trade. He also supported efforts to annex Santa Domingo into the United States. Beginning in 1872, McCormick served a four-year term on the Illinois Democratic Party's Central Committee.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.jrank.org"/&gt; McCormick later proposed an international mechanism to control food production and distribution.

McCormick also became the principal benefactor and a trustee of what had been the Theological Seminary of the Northwest, which moved to Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood in 1859, a year in which he endowed four professorships. The institution was renamed [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] in 1886, after his death, although it moved to Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood in 1975 and began sharing facilities with the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago]].

In 1869, McCormick donated $10,000 to help [[Dwight L. Moody]] start the [[YMCA|Young Men's Christian Association]], and his son Cyrus Jr. would become the first president of the [[Moody Bible Institute]].&lt;ref name="liberty-virtue-independence.blogspot.com"/&gt;

McCormick and later his widow, Nettie Day McCormick, also donated significant sums to [[Tusculum College]], a Presbyterian institution in Tennessee, as well as to establish churches and Sunday Schools in the South after the war, even though that region was slow to adopt his farm machinery and improved practices. Also, in 1872, McCormick purchased a religious newspaper, the ''Interior'', which he renamed the ''Continent'' and became a leading Presbyterian periodical.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.jrank.org"/&gt;

For the last 20 years of his life, McCormick was a benefactor and member of the board of trustees at [[Washington and Lee University]] in his native Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Historical Benefactions Support Washington and Lee University |url= http://www.wlu.edu/x51099.xml |publisher= Washington and Lee University |accessdate= December 31, 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120218101417/http://www.wlu.edu/x51099.xml |archivedate= February 18, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Leander also donated funds to build an observatory on [[Mount Jefferson (Virginia)|Mount Jefferson]], operated by the [[University of Virginia]] and named the [[McCormick Observatory]].

==Later life and death==
During the last four years of his life, McCormick became an invalid, after a stroke paralyzed his legs; he was unable to walk during his final two years. He died at home in Chicago on May 13, 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Cyrus H. McCormick Dead |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/05/14/106278925.pdf | newspaper=The New York Times | date= May 14, 1884 | accessdate= 2007-08-21 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[Graceland Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Hutchinson_1935"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hutchinson|1935}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his widow, Nettie, who continued his Christian and charitable activities, within the United States and abroad, between 1890 and her death in 1923, donating $8 million (over $160 million in modern equivalents) to hospitals, disaster and relief agencies, churches, youth activities and educational institutions, and becoming the leading benefactress of Presbyterian Church activities in that era.&lt;ref name="liberty-virtue-independence.blogspot.com"/&gt;

Official leadership of the company passed to his eldest son [[Cyrus McCormick Jr.|Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr.]], but his grandson Cyrus McCormick III ran the company. Four years later, the company's labor practices (paying workers $9 per week) led to the [[Haymarket riots]]. Ultimately Cyrus Jr. teamed with J.P. Morgan to create the International Harvester Corporation in 1902. After Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr., [[Harold Fowler McCormick]] ran International Harvester. Various members of the [[McCormick family]] continued involvement with the corporation until [[Brooks McCormick]], who died in 2006.

==Legacy and honors==

Numerous prizes and medals were awarded McCormick for his reaper, which reduced human labor on farms while increasing productivity. Thus, it contributed to the industrialization of agriculture as well as migration of labor to cities in numerous wheat-growing countries (36 by McCormick's death). The French government named McCormick an Officier de la Légion d'honneur in 1851, and he was elected a corresponding member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1878 "as having done more for the cause of agriculture than any other living man."&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.com"/&gt;

The [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] holds Cyrus McCormick's papers.&lt;ref name="whs"/&gt;

*The [[Cyrus McCormick Farm]], operated by other family members after Cyrus and Leander moved to Chicago, was ultimately donated to [[Virginia Tech]] which operates the core of the property as a free museum, and other sections as an experimental farm. A marker memorializing Cyrus McCormick's contribution to agriculture had been erected near the main house in 1928.
*A statue of McCormick was erected on the front campus of [[Washington and Lee University]], at [[Lexington, Virginia]].

'''Dallas City Hall''' is the seat of Dallas municipal government, located at 1500 Marilla in the [[Government District, Dallas|Government District]] of [[downtown Dallas|downtown]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]). The current building, the city's fifth city hall, was completed in 1978 and replaced the [[Dallas Municipal Building]].

==History==
[[Image:DallasMunicipalCenterPlan1946.jpg|thumb|150px|left|City plans from 1946 called for a grand [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] municipal center in Downtown Dallas]]

The City of Dallas' idea for a centralized municipal center began when city planning consultants Harland Bartholomew &amp; Associates presented their ideas in 1944. The idea was to relocate from the current [[Dallas Municipal Building]] to a grand [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] complex of city and federal offices, a convention center and cultural facilities. Two sites downtown were possible contenders: one north centered on Federal Street and Akard, and one south centered on Young Street.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/fatguyinalittlecoat/3054060248/in/photostream/&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans proceeded until cost estimates shocked city leaders and the plan was shelved, although land at the southern site was acquired by the city for future use.

The 1963 [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]] turned the world against the city, as Dallas became known as the "City of Hate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Marking Kennedy Assassination, Dallas Still On 'Eggshells'|date=November 21, 2013|work=[[All Things Considered]]|author= [[Wade Goodwyn]] |publisher=NPR|quote=In the 1960s — after the president's murder — Dallas became known around the world as "The City of Hate." And it was a hotbed of right-wing politics, a magnet for the extremes of the conservative movement at the time.|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/11/21/246580954/marking-kennedy-assassination-dallas-still-on-egg-shells}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dallas Mayor [[J. Erik Jonsson|Erik Jonsson]] made it a priority to reinvent the city's image, and the "Goals for Dallas" program was enacted to accomplish this. One of goals, Design of the City, was summarized by the statement, "We demand a city of beauty and functional fitness that embraces the quality of life for all its people." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/0729/building_2-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; This was the start of the movement to create a new modern City Hall and municipal center.

Planning for the Dallas Municipal Center commenced in 1964 when the Dallas City Council appointeda Citizen's City Hall Site Committee to select an appropriate location for new municipal administration offices.&lt;ref name="dallascityhall.com"&gt;http://www.dallascityhall.com/html/dallas_city_hall.html&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor was closely involved with the project, and a committee of prominent citizens settled on I.M. Pei to design the new facility.

Construction began on June 26, 1972 under the direction of contractor Robert E. McKee and Pei. The project was completed in three phases. The City accepted the garage parking areas in November 1974; the Park Plaza in May 1976; and the building in December 1977. The cost of design and construction of the building, the Park Plaza and the garage was over $70 million. Controversies arose over cost overruns (the original estimated cost was $42.2 million) and aesthetic issues (was the building too avant-garde?), though most problems were addressed and work moved on to completion.&lt;ref name="dallascityhall.com"/&gt;

The first Dallas City Council meeting was held in the building's City Council Chamber on February 1, 1978, and the entire facility was formally opened and dedicated on March 12, 1978.

==Design==
&lt;blockquote&gt;When you do a city hall, it has to convey an image of the people, and this had to represent the people of Dallas ... The people I met &amp;ndash; rich and poor, powerful and not so powerful &amp;ndash; were all very proud of their city. They felt that Dallas was the greatest city there was, and I could not disappoint them.
&amp;ndash; I.M. Pei&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/dallascityhall/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[I.M. Pei]]'s [[modern architecture|modernist]] inverted [[pyramid]] design is a result of space requirements from city government. Public areas and citizen services required much less space than offices that ran the government and overhanging the upper floors allowed them to be larger than the public spaces below. The building slopes at a 34° angle, with each of the 7 above-grade floors being 9½ feet wider than the one below. This inclined façade interacts with the buildings it faces downtown and provides protection from the weather and Texas sun.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/texas/dallas/cityhall/pei.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation and basement levels are considerably wider than the apparent footprint of the structure, extending out beneath the inclined facade. The [[cantilever]]ed roof is 200 feet (61 meters) wide, the ground floor is 126 feet (38.4 meters) wide, and the basement 230 feet (70.1 meters) wide.&lt;ref name="architectureweek.com"&gt;http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/0729/building_2-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;
When Mayor Jonsson reacted to the apparent top-heaviness of the building's shape, 3 cylindrical pillars that appear the hold up the structure were created. These contain stairwells that had originally been concealed within the design. These pillars only provide visual support and do not bear the load of the building.&lt;ref name="architectureweek.com"/&gt;

Pei also persuaded the city to acquire an additional 6 acres in front of the building as a plaza and buffer zone for his grand public structure. A 1,325 car parking garage was built beneath the plaza, and the extra income helped supplement the funding of the building.

A buff-colored concrete was chosen for the main building material; its color resembled local earth tones. Since concrete was both the primary structural and finish material, close attention was paid to every aspect of its mix and placement.&lt;ref name="architectureweek.com"/&gt;

The design of Dallas City Hall inspired the [[J. Erik Jonsson Central Library]] building located across the street &amp;ndash; whereas the upper floors of City Hall are oriented ''toward'' Marilla Street, the upper floors of the Central Library are oriented ''away from'' Marilla (and, in a form of symmetry, away from City Hall).

The building features in the ''[[Robocop]]'' movies of the 1980s, as the Headquarters of the OCP company; special effects were employed to make the building appear taller than it is.&lt;ref&gt;http://texaspopculture.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/robocop-visits-city-hall.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasfilmcommission.com/robocop-dallas-locations-then-now/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
*City Hall contained 1,400 workstations when it opened in 1978. It had few floor-to-ceiling walls, using instead five-, six-, and seven-foot-high partitions to create separate offices. The absence of walls allowed employees and visitors to have window views from all areas.
*The second floor of Dallas City Hall is referred to as the Great Court because of its {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} length and the uninterrupted height to the vaulted ceiling approximately {{convert|100|ft|m}} above.
*The Park Plaza is two blocks long and one block wide and is bounded by Young, Ervay, Marilla and Akard streets. The Plaza includes a {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}}-diameter reflecting pool, a variable-height fountain, park benches and three distinctive {{convert|84|ft|m|adj=on}}-high flagpoles. The Plaza is landscaped with trees native to Texas: live oaks and red oaks. The reflective pool contains large floating sculptures designed by artist [[Marta Pan]].
*A {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}}-high by {{convert|24|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide, three-piece sculpture titled "The Dallas Piece" was designed by [[Henry Moore]] for the plaza and resembles vertebrae.
*A state-of-the-art Conference Center that includes a 156-seat auditorium and three conference rooms was recently added to Dallas City Hall.
*A tunnel and station for future rail transit was constructed in the third level basement beneath the parking garage and Marilla Street. This tunnel has remained unused but has been considered for [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART's]] second light rail route through downtown Dallas.

'''Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC''' ('''DCI''') is a joint venture of major motion picture studios, formed to establish a standard [[systems architecture|architecture]] for [[digital cinema]] systems.

The organization was formed in March 2002 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]],{{Efn | [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] withdrew as a member of DCI in May 2005, prior to the release of the DCI Specification.}} [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Universal Studios]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Warner Bros.]]

The primary purpose of DCI is to establish and document specifications for an [[open architecture]] for digital cinema that ensures a uniform and high level of technical performance, reliability and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DCI | type = home page | url = http://www.dcimovies.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By establishing a common set of content requirements, [[film distributor|distributors]], [[production company|studios]], [[movie theater|exhibitors]], d-cinema manufacturers and vendors can be assured of interoperability and compatibility. Because of the relationship of DCI to many of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s key studios, conformance to DCI's specifications is considered a requirement by [[software developers]] or equipment manufacturers targeting the digital cinema market.

==Specification==
On July 20, 2005, DCI released Version 1.0 of its "Digital Cinema System Specification", commonly referred to as the "DCI Specification". The document describes overall system requirements and specifications for digital cinema. Between March 28, 2006, and March 21, 2007, DCI issued 148 errata to Version 1.0.

DCI released Version 1.1 of the DCI Specification on April 12, 2007, incorporating the previous 148 errata into the DCI Specification. On April 15, 2007, at the annual NAB Digital Cinema Summit, DCI announced the new version, as well as some future plans. They released a "Stereoscopic Digital Cinema Addendum"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Stereoscopic DC | type = addendum | publisher = DCI | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url = http://www.dcimovies.com/DCI_Stereoscopic_DC_Addendum.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to begin to establish 3-D technical specifications in response to the popularity of [[3-D film|3-D stereoscopic films]]. It was also announced "which studios would take over the leadership roles in DCI after the current leadership term expires at the end of September."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/markets-festivals/dci-announces-digital-3-d-specs-1117963138/|title=DCI announces digital, 3-D specs|last=Cohen|first=David S|date=2007-04-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-10|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, between August 27, 2007, and February 1, 2008, DCI issued 100 errata to Version 1.1. So, DCI released Version 1.2 of the DCI Specification on March 7, 2008, again incorporating the previous 100 errata into the specification document. An additional 96 errata were issued by August 30, 2012, so a revised Version 1.2 incorporating those additional errata was approved on October 10, 2012. DCI approved DCI Specification Version 1.3 on June 27, 2018, integrating the 45 errata issued to the previous version into a new document. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DCSS Version 1.3 | date = 2018-06-27 | publisher = DCI | url = http://dcimovies.com/specification/DCI_DCSS_Ver1-3_2018-0627.pdf | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous versions are also archived on the DCI web site.

Based on many [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] and [[International Standards Organization|ISO]] standards, such as [[JPEG 2000]]-compressed image and "broadcast wave" [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]]/[[WAV]] sound, it explains the route to create an entire [[Digital Cinema Package]] (DCP) from a raw collection of files known as the Digital Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM), as well as the specifics of its content protection, [[encryption]], and [[forensic identification|forensic marking]].

The specification also establishes standards for the decoder requirements and the presentation environment itself, such as ambient light levels, [[pixel]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect]] and shape, image [[luminance]], [[white point]] [[chromaticity]], and those [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerances]] to be kept.

Even though it specifies what kind of information is required, the DCI Specification does not include specific information about how data within a distribution package is to be formatted. Formatting of this information is defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) digital cinema standards and related documents.{{Efn | As of 1 January 2018, the following fifty-six SMPTE engineering guidelines, recommended practices, registered disclosure documents and standards had been adopted and published:  • EG 432-1 Digital Source Processing - Color Processing for D-Cinema • EG 432-2 Digital Source Processing - D-Cinema Low Frequency Effects (LFE) Channel Audio Characteristics • RDD 20 Cinelink 2 Specification • RP 200 Relative and Absolute Sound Pressure Levels for Motion-Picture Multichannel Sound Systems - Applicable for Analog Photographic Film Audio, Digital Photographic Film Audio and D-Cinema • RP 428-4 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Audio File Format and Delivery Constraints • RP 428-5 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Mapping of Images into Constrained Tag Image File • RP 428-6 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Digital Leader • RP 431-2 D-Cinema Quality - Reference Projector and Environment • ST 336 Data Encoding Protocol Using Key-Length-Value • ST 337-1 Material Exchange Format (MXF) - File Format Specification • ST 377-4 MXF Multichannel Audio Labeling Framework • ST 379-1 Material Exchange Format (MXF) - MXF Generic Container • ST 379-2 For Television - Material Exchange Format (MXF) - MXF Constrained Generic Container • ST 382 Material Exchange Format - Mapping AES3 and Broadcast Wave Audio into the MXF Generic Container • ST 390 Material Exchange Format (MXF) - Specialized Operational Pattern ''OP-Atom'' (Simplified Representation of a Single Item) • ST 400 SMPTE Labels Structure • ST 410 Material Exchange Format - Generic Stream Partition • ST 422 Material Exchange Format - Mapping JPEG 2000 Codestreams into the MXF Generic Container • ST 427 Link Encryption for 1.5 Gb/s Serial Digital Interface • ST 428-1 D-Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM) - Image Characteristics • ST 428-2 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Audio Characteristics • ST 428-7 Digital Cinema Distribution Master - Subtitle • ST 428-9 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Image Pixel Structure Level 3 - Serial Digital Interface Signal Formatting • ST 428-10 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Closed Caption and Closed Subtitle • ST 428-11 Additional Frame Rates for D-Cinema • ST 428-12 D-Cinema Distribution Master Common Audio Channels and Soundfield Groups • ST 428-19 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Additional Frame Rates Level AFR2 and Level AFR4 - Serial Digital Interface Signal Formatting • ST 428-21 Archive Frame Rates for D-Cinema • ST 429-2 D-Cinema Packaging - DCP Operational Constraints • ST 429-3 D-Cinema Packaging - Sound and Picture Track File • ST 429-4 D-Cinema Packaging - MXF JPEG 2000 Application • ST 429-5 D-Cinema Packaging - Timed Text Track File • ST 429-6 D-Cinema Packaging - MXF Track File Essence Encryption • ST 429-7 D-Cinema Packaging - Composition Playlist • ST 429-8 D-Cinema Packaging - Packing List • ST 429-9 D-Cinema Packaging - Asset Mapping and File Segmentation • ST 429-10 D-Cinema Packaging - Stereoscopic Picture Track File • ST 429-12 D-Cinema Packaging - Caption and Closed Subtitle • ST 429-13 D-Cinema Packaging - DCP Operational Constraints for Additional Frame Rates • ST 429-14 D-Cinema Packaging - Aux Data Track File • ST 429-16 Additional Composition Metadata and Guidelines • ST 430-1 D-Cinema Operations - Key Delivery Message • ST 430-2 D-Cinema Operations - Digital Certificate • ST 430-3 D-Cinema Operations - Generic Extra-Theater Message Format • ST 430-4 D-Cinema Operations - Log Record Format Specification • ST 430-5 D-Cinema Packaging - Security Log Event Class and Constraints • ST 430-6 D-Cinema Operations - Auditorium Security Messages for Intra-Theater Communications • ST 430-9 D-Cinema Operations - Key Delivery Bundle • ST 430-10 D-Cinema Operations - Auxiliary Content Synchronization Protocol • ST 430-11 D-Cinema Operations - Auxiliary Resource Presentation List • ST 430-12 D-Cinema Operations - FSK Synchronization Signal • ST 430-14 D-Cinema Operations - Digital Sync Signal and Aux Data Transfer Protocol • ST 430-15 D-Cinema Operations - Facility List Message Exchange Protocol • ST 430-16 D-Cinema Operations - Extended Facility List Message • ST 431-1 D-Cinema Quality - Screen Luminance Level, Chromaticity and Uniformity • ST 433 D-Cinema - XML Data Types}}

The maximum compressed bit rate for support of all proposed frame rates should be 500 Mbit/s.

==Related information==
The idea for DCI was originally mooted in late 1999 by [[Tom McGrath (media executive)|Tom McGrath]], then COO of [[Paramount Pictures]], who applied to the U.S. Department of Justice for anti-trust waivers to allow the joint cooperation of all seven major motion picture studios.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Universal Pictures]] made one of the first feature-length DCPs created to DCI specifications, using their film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DCinemaToday | url = http://www.dcinematoday.com/dc/pr.aspx?newsID=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not distributed theatrically, it had one public screening on November 7, 2005, at the USC Entertainment Technology Center's Digital Cinema Laboratory in the Pacific Theatre, Hollywood. ''[[Inside Man]]'' was Universal's first DCP commercial release, and, in addition to 35mm film distribution, was delivered via hard drive to 20 theatres in the [[United States]] along with two [[trailer (film)|trailers]].

The Academy Film Archive houses the Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC Collection, which includes film and digital elements from DCI’s Standard Evaluation Material (StEM), a 12-minute production shot on 35mm and 65mm film, created for vendors and standards organizations to test and evaluate image compression and digital projection technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC Collection|url=http://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/digital-cinema-initiatives-llc|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''détournement''' ({{IPA-fr|detuʁnəmɑ̃|lang}}), meaning "rerouting, hijacking" in [[French language|French]], is a technique developed in the 1950s by the [[Letterist International]],&lt;ref name="nues8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sami.is.free.fr/Oeuvres/debord_wolman_mode_emploi_detournement.html |title=Mode d'emploi du détournement |last1=Debord |first1=Guy-Ernest |last2=Wolman |first2=Gil J. |date=May 1956 |language=French |publisher=biblioteque-virtuelle |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later adapted by the [[Situationist International]] (SI),&lt;ref name="ReportManifesto57"&gt;''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI58"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline///si/is1.html |journal=Situationist International |number=1 |title=Definitions |date=June 1958 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was defined in the SI's inaugural 1958 journal as "[t]he integration of present or past artistic productions into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of those means. In a more elementary sense, ''détournement'' within the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method which reveals the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres."&lt;ref name="SI58" /&gt;&lt;ref name="si58french"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ubumexico.centro.org.mx/text/si/Internationale_situationniste_1.pdf |journal=internationale situationiste |title=Définitions |language=French |quote=Intégration de productions actuelles ou passées des arts dans une construction supérieure du milieu. Dans ce sens il ne peut y avoir de peinture ou de musique situationniste, mais un usage situationniste de ces moyens. Dans un sens plus primitif, le détournement à l'intérieur des sphères culturelles anciennes est une méthode de propagande, qui témoigne de l'usure et de la perte d'importance de ces sphères. |page=13 |number=1 |date=June 1958 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It has been defined elsewhere as "turning expressions of the capitalist system and its [[media culture]] against itself"&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"&gt;Douglas B. Holt: Cultural Strategy Using Innovative Ideologies to Build Breakthrough Brands, Oxford University Press 2010, p.252&lt;/ref&gt;—as when slogans and logos are turned against their advertisers or the political status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kaste [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=141526467 ''Exploring Occupy Wall Street's 'Adbuster' Origins''], ''NPR'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Détournement was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called [[situationist prank]] that was reprised by the [[punk movement]] in the late 1970s&lt;ref name="Marrone05"&gt;Marrone, Gianfranco (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0jluoyGktKsC&amp;pg=PT43 ''Sensi alterati: droghe, musica, immagini''], p.45, quote: "...gioco al complotto, alla manipolazione dei media, alla beffa, alla "grande truffa," o al ''detournement'' – inventato dai situazionisti e ripreso dai punk – che appunto del situazionismo sono talvolta concreti continuatori. Pensiamo in questo senso al fin troppo noto caso, esagerato dai media, ma paradigmatico, del manager dei Sex Pistols, [[Malcolm McLaren]], a partire dal quale, nell'estate del 1977, si scatenò, con grande scandalo, il lancio del gruppo dei Pistols in pieno Giubileo della regina, e l'interesse della stampa per la nascente scena punk. Tuttavia, anche in questo caso non si tratta, come invece è stato spesso sostenuto, di freddo "gioco a tavolino", di cinismo, di furbo lancio di un prodotto da parte di chi aveva studiato i media e lavorava sulla guerriglia semiologica (cfr. Fabbri P. 2002, p.40), di una tattica che sarebbe poi stata facilmente sfruttata e fatta propria da quel momento in avanti dall'industria culturale ''mainstream''."&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired the [[culture jamming]] movement in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt;

Its opposite is [[recuperation (politics)|recuperation]], in which radical ideas or the social image of people who are viewed negatively are twisted, commodified, and absorbed in a more socially acceptable context.

==Definition==
In general it can be defined as a variation on previous work, in which the newly created work has a meaning that is antagonistic or antithetical to the original. The original media work that is ''détourned''&lt;!-- must check if détourned is syntactically correct --&gt; must be somewhat familiar to the target audience, so that it can appreciate the opposition of the new message. The artist or commentator making the variation can reuse only some of the characteristic elements of the originating work.

Détournement is similar to [[satire|satirical]] [[parody]], but employs more direct reuse or faithful [[mimicry]] of the original works rather than constructing a new work which merely alludes strongly to the original.  It may be contrasted with [[recuperation (sociology)|recuperation]], in which originally subversive works and ideas are themselves [[cultural appropriation|appropriated]] by mainstream media.

One could view détournement as forming the opposite side of the coin to '[[recuperation (politics)|recuperation]]' (where radical ideas and images become safe and commodified), in that images produced by the spectacle get altered and subverted so that rather than supporting the ''status quo'', their meaning becomes changed in order to put across a more radical or oppositional message.

[[Guy Debord]] and [[Gil J Wolman]] categorized détourned elements into two types: ''minor détournements'' and ''deceptive détournements''. Minor détournements are détournements of elements that in themselves are of no real importance such as a snapshot, a press clipping, an everyday object which draw all their meaning from being placed in a new context. Deceptive détournements are when already significant elements such as a major political or philosophical text, great artwork or work of literature take on new meanings or scope by being placed in a new context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/detourn.htm A User's Guide To Détournement May 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

Détournement is the integration of past or present artistic production into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of these means. In a more primitive sense, détournement with the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method that testifies to the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres.&lt;ref name="SI58" /&gt;&lt;ref name="si58french"/&gt;

== Examples after the Situationist International ==
In the United States, [[Frank Discussion]] is widely known for his use of détournement in his works dating from the late 1970s through the present, particularly with the [[Feederz]]. The use of détournement by [[Barbara Kruger]] familiarised many with the technique, and it was extensively and effectively used as part of the early [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|HIV/AIDS activism]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Crimp, Douglas.  ''AIDS Demographics''. Bay Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of contemporary detournement include [[Adbusters]]' "[[subvertising|subvertisements]]" and other instances of [[culture jamming]], as well as poems composed collaboratively by [[Marlene Mountain]], [[Paul Conneally]], and others, in which quotations from such famous sources as the [[Ten Commandments]] and quotations by [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]] are combined with haiku-like phrases to produce a larger work intended to subvert the original source.  The comic artist [[Brad Neely]]'s reinterpretation of [[Harry Potter]], ''[[Wizard People, Dear Reader|Wizard People]],'' took Warner Brother's first Harry Potter film, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|The Sorcerer's Stone]],'' and substituted the original soundtrack with a narration that casts the hero as a [[Nietzschean]] [[Übermensch|superman]].

The concept of détournement has had a popular influence amongst contemporary radicals, and the technique can be seen in action in the present day when looking at the work of [[Culture Jammer]]s including the [[Cacophony Society]], [[Billboard Liberation Front]], [[monochrom]], Occupy Movements&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JD8jNCQ2gw Détournement of Bronzed Historical Icons adorns imaginary John Harvard with a Guy Fawkes mask]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adbusters]], whose 'subvertisements' 'detourn' [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] adverts, for example. In this case, the original advertisement's imagery is altered in order to draw attention to said company's policy of shifting their production base to cheap-labour third-world '[[free trade zone]]s'. However, the line between 'recuperation' and 'détournement' can become thin (or at least very fuzzy) at times, as [[Naomi Klein]] points out in her book ''[[No Logo]]''. Here she details how [[corporation]]s such as Nike, [[Pepsi]] or Diesel have approached Culture Jammers and Adbusters and offered them lucrative contracts in return for partaking in 'ironic' promotional campaigns. She points out further irony by drawing attention to merchandising produced in order to promote Adbusters' [[Buy Nothing Day]], an example of the recuperation of détournement if ever there was one.

Klein's arguments about irony [[wikt:reify|reifying]] rather than breaking down power structures are echoed by [[Slavoj Žižek]]. Žižek argues that the kind of distance opened up by détournement is the condition of possibility for ideology to operate: by attacking and distancing oneself from the sign-systems of capital, the subject creates a fantasy of transgression that "covers up" his/her actual complicity with capitalism as an overarching system. In contrast, scholars are very fond of pointing out the differences between [[hypergraphics]], 'detournement', the [[postmodern]] idea of [[cultural appropriation|appropriation]] and the [[Neoist]] use of [[plagiarism]] as the use of different and similar techniques used for different and similar means, effects and causes.

The [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] has a long history of aggressive détournement of extreme political ideologies, as do several [[industrial music|industrial music groups]], such as [[Die Krupps]], [[Nitzer Ebb]], [[KMFDM]], and [[Front 242]].

[[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] uses détournement and [[culture jamming]] extensively in his work, particularly in the British television series ''[[The Day Today]]'' and ''[[Brass Eye]]''.

The [[Istanbul]]-based platform InEnArt, on the occasion of the [[Istanbul Biennial|13th Istanbul Biennial]] 2013, launched  a forum titled Urban Voices focusing on phenomena that are turning expressions of the system and its media culture against itself. The authors of InEnArt are regularly publishing different phenomenas of détournement and invite the online community to participate by uploading similar examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Public Space as a Political Forum|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?page_id=11121|work=InEnArt|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erwin Leonard Guy Abel''' (23 October 1911 – 1 May 1995) was a New Zealand grocer, businessman, athlete and racehorse owner. He was born in [[Ohakune]], [[Rotorua/Taupo]], [[New Zealand]] on 23 October 1911.&lt;ref name="DNZB Abel"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Erwin Leonard Guy Abel|first= Lynette J.|last= Williams|id=5a1|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onthey opened Abel opened New Zealand's first shopping mall, The Big A Plaza, at [[Glenview, New Zealand|Glenview, Hamilton]] in October 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mp.natlib.govt.nz/detail/?id=41793 |title=Object 41793 Detail |publisher=National Library of New Zealand |access-date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early Life &amp; career===
On 23 October 1911, Erwin Leonard Guy Abel was born in Ohakune to a farm worker and bush contractor named Leonard Guy Abel, and his wife Rosa Hunt. He was the second of four children and was known as, Wynn. Abel grew up [[Waikato Region|Waikato]] and the [[King Country]], both regions in North-Western New Zealand; he did live for a few months on [[Banks Peninsula]]. In Cambridge, Abel worked as a grocery assistant at the Farmer's Trading Company store; he was fourteen and finished with school, he would work for eight years there.

On 16 March 1933, Abel married Jean Winifred Keene in [[Auckland]]. The couple would have five children together: Four daughters and one son. It was soon after Abel's wedding that he would get a promotion at the grocery store: Able was transferred to the [[Whangarei]] branch of farmers where he was to manage the grocery department of the store.

Abel was a very precocious young man who was constantly driven by self-improvement: He studied bookkeeping, grocery retailing and business management until he was well versed in all three subjects. In fact, Abel took up a second job, for some extra money, selling correspondence classes. In 1936, Abel had received a diploma from the London-based Fern Business Institute for management. It was soon after receiving this academic accolade that he purchased his own grocery business, the Wellworth While stores; it was located in central Whangarei.

Abel found success with his grocery business in central Whangarei, credit is likely due to his business philosophy: Combining the lowest prices with the highest quality and standards of personal services, both helping to ensure quality customers that had loyalty. His business had a catch phrase that it advertised to customers: "If Abels hasn’t got it … nobody has!". This catch phrase had really captured the essence of Abel's dedication to customer service and what his business was all about.

During the [[Second World War]] Abel and his family provided and packaged its own products at his grocery store; these products included pickled onions, bottled jam, and cream biscuits. By the 1950s, Abel purchased a second store in Whangarei and had his only son—Len—manage it.

Able was truly an innovative businessman, especially for the grocery industry; he claimed to be the first grocer to take the backs out of their shop windows at the store to allow for the customers to provide themselves with self-service.

===Mid-life and career===
In 1953, Abel had won a research trip to Europe and North America to study grocery retailing, wholesaling plus the new and wildly popular supermarkets. When Abel returned from his research trip he decided to open his own supermarket with his son. On 29 November 1961, Abel and his son had chosen [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] as the site for their new supermarket; it opened in the Hamilton suburb of [[Hillcrest, Waikato|Hillcrest]]. It was Hamilton's first supermarket and in turn was one of New Zealand's first supermarkets. The supermarket venture became a huge success: They very next year the Abels built four new adjoining supermarkets.

On 8 October 1969, Abel and his son opened their "Big 'A' Plaza" at [[Glenview, New Zealand|Glenview]]; at the time a fast developing suburb in Hamilton. The "Big 'A' Plaza" was the first shopping mall for New Zealand: The shopping mall was another new concept in retailing during that time. The Abels had opened three new shops at the Plaza in Glenview: A juvenile boutique, an electric appliance store, and a supermarket.

The Abels continued to purchase, sell and develop business after creating the "Big 'A' Plaza" shopping mall. The family company soon became composed of Erwin Abel, his wife Jean Abel, and his son Len Abel. The new Abel team would start with the purchase of the supermarket in [[Tauranga]]. The other purchases would soon expand to two discount grocery stores, properties in Hamilton and [[Rotorua]], and the acquisition of company to manufacture household cleansers and hardware goods.

From 1958 to 1961, Abel had served on the board of directors for [[Foodstuffs|Foodstuffs Limited]], a New Zealand grocery and liquor retailer—Abel had served on the Board in Auckland. After Abel was a consultant for [[Pak'nSave|Pak n' Save]]'s development—a New Zealand retail grocery warehouse chain that provides discount goods—he was considered highly influential and the Foodstuffs Limited board of directors became re-interested and impressed with Abel; the Directors asked him to rejoined the board of directors at Foodstuffs Limited starting in 1970 and ending in 1982.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Abel and his wife decided to move from their home in Hillcrest to a new property ranging 26 acres in [[Tamahere]]; the property was called Malabar Farm. One of the appeals of their new residence was that the land could support the breeding and raising of race horses. It was at this farm that the Abels would start to breed thoroughbred race horses and raised a number of winners; the most notable was Van Der Hum whom, in 1976, won the [[Melbourne Cup]].

Abel had a serious interest in athletics and in his older years became quite an accomplished athlete. His main focus and interests in athletics lied in [[Cross country running|cross-country running]] and [[Marathon|marathon running]]. In 1965, Abel ran his first marathon. In 1981, at the New Zealand [[World Masters Athletics Championships|Veteran's Championships]], Abel—at the age of 70—had competed and won in four different events: The over 400 meter run, the over 800 meter run, the over 1500 meter run, and the over 5000 meter run. In 1983, at the All-American Championships in [[Texas]], Abel had won the gold medal for the 1500 meter in the 70 – 74 age group.

In 1982, the Abel's had finally sold their last two businesses: The supermarkets in Glenview and Hillcrest. The family decision was made on a couple of factors, however, the most important reasoning was that their son, Len, died that year due to poor health; this left the Abel couple to run two businesses past their ages of retirement, a grossly unwanted burden during their time of mourning.

===Retirement &amp; death===
In Abel's retirement he maintained his athletic endeavours (i.e. competitive cross-country running and marathon running). Both him and his wife, Jean, also continued to breed, raise, and race thoroughbreds. In addition to Abel's other activities, he enjoyed growing and maintaining an organic vegetable garden; he served as a member of the [[Soil &amp; Health Association of New Zealand|Soil and Health Association of New Zealand]]. Abel even took up practising [[yoga]] for relaxation and to sustain mental vitality.

In 1989, Abel and his wife, Jean, sold their home—Malabar Farm—and bought a more suitable property for their senior years; they moved to the Alandale Retirement Village, just outside Hamilton, by purchasing one of its villas. On 1 April 1995, Erwin Abel died at the Waikato Hospital in Hamilton. He had suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] for twelve years before finally succumbing to the condition. Abel was survived by his wife, Jean (whom died in 1997), and his three daughters.

[[File:Morrisons' Distribution Centre, Eurocentral Business Park, Mossend, 18 September 2011.jpg|thumb|Morrisons' distribution centre]]
'''Eurocentral''' is one of the largest industrial estates in Scotland situated on the edge of Holytown and Mossend, [[North Lanarkshire]], just off the A8/M8 motorway, about {{convert|12|mi|km}} east of [[Glasgow]] city centre and {{convert|34|mi|km}} west of [[Edinburgh]]. The nearest communities to the estate are Holytown, Mossend, Chapelhall, Calderbank and Carnbroe. The closest major towns are Bellshill {{convert|4|mi|km}}, Motherwell {{convert|4|mi|km}}, Coatbridge {{convert|4|mi|km}} and Airdrie {{convert|4.5|mi|km}}.

[[File:The Big Heids, Eurocentral (geograph 2584498).jpg|thumb|"The Big Heids" sculpture]]
There is a bus link to and from Glasgow city centre and Livingston, West Lothian. Eurocentral has warehouse distribution centres, factories, call centres, a railfreight centre which links with Grangemouth docks {{convert|28|mi|km}} to the north east, England to the south and beyond to mainland Europe. The estate also has a large modern hotel/restaurant (Dakota). One of the landmarks of the Eurocentral are the so-called "Big Heids" which are three red upturned shipping containers with tubes making the shape of human heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scottish fact of the day: M8 motorway sculptures |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/scottish-fact-of-the-day-m8-motorway-sculptures-1-3621566 |accessdate=31 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maxim Office Park is a recent addition opening in March 2010. With 10 buildings totalling over {{convert|756000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Built in a single phase, Maxim is also the UK’s largest speculatively built office park.

==Eurocentral factory==
Eurocentral was the name given to a former factory near [[Holytown]] in [[North Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]] operated by the Taiwanese television parts manufacturer Chunghwa Picture Tubes (中華映管). The building is sometimes referred to as ''The Chunghwa Factory''. The factory is infamous because it was built using large amounts of taxpayers’ money but was demolished within 10 years.

Originally designed as a factory to produce [[cathode ray tube]]s for use in television sets and monitors, the rapid rise in popularity of LCD and plasma televisions contributed to the huge losses made by the Chunghwa company. It is also reported that a huge water bill from [[West of Scotland Water]] also helped contribute to the eventual demise of the site. Opening in 1996 the factory was expected to create 3,000 local jobs. However employment never rose above 1,200 and the factory was empty by 2003. The company was forced to repay £8 million of the £20 million it received from the government.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The factory was demolished and the site developed into a mixed use commercial and business park.

==Maxim Park==
The £330 million park is the UK’s largest speculative office park development, comprising 10 buildings, totalling {{convert|756000|sqft}} of high quality space. The entire park was completed in March 2010. As well as Grade A office accommodation and a wide range of shops and leisure facilities the park also houses one of Scotland's largest nurseries, Papillon Nursery and one of the [[Dakota Hotels]] (although not part of the Maxim estate it is very close by and built in keeping with the park's image).

The park currently has a shuttle bus service provided by Castle Cars of Uddingston.

Current tenants include: Proact IT, Papillon Nursery, [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]], REGUS, Currie &amp; Brown, Vaillant, Berits &amp; Brown, Peppery Horse, ACS Clothing and Sure Thing Insurance, a newly incorporated insurance intermediary.

In June 2014, planning permission was granted for the addition of a sports pavilion.

{{trade bloc}}
'''Government procurement''' or '''public procurement''' is the [[procurement]] of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]] and [[construction]] on behalf of a public authority, such as a [[government]] agency. With 10 to 20% of [[GDP]], government procurement accounts for a substantial part of the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/govpro.html Global Trade Negotiations Home Page] at [[Harvard University]], accessed 18 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent [[fraud]], [[waste]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], or local [[protectionism]], the laws of most countries regulate government procurement to some extent. Laws usually require the procuring authority to issue public [[Call for bids|tenders]] if the value of the procurement exceeds a certain threshold.

Government procurement is also the subject of the [[Agreement on Government Procurement]] (GPA), a [[plurilateral]] international treaty under the auspices of the [[WTO]].

==Overview==

=== Need for government procurement ===
Government procurement is necessary because governments cannot produce all the inputs for the goods they provide themselves. Governments usually provide [[public good]]s, e.g. national defense or public infrastructure. Public goods are non-rival and non-excludable, which means that one individual's consumption does not diminish the quantity or quality of the commodity available to others, and individuals cannot be prevented from freely consuming the commodity, or [[Free-rider problem|"free-riding"]]. Consequently, private markets cannot provide public goods. Instead the government provides those goods and finances them by raising taxes from all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/712588185|title=Economics|last=Mankiw|first=Nicholas Gregory|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|others=Taylor, Mark P. 1958-|year=|isbn=9781844808700|edition= 2nd|location=Andover|pages=223–226|oclc=712588185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public goods, governments often also provide [[merit good]]s, such as education or health care. Merit goods are [[private good]]s which are rival and excludable and are therefore provided by private markets. Nevertheless, governments also provide merit goods because of reasons of [[Equity (economics)|equity]] and fairness and because they have [[Externality|positive externalities]] for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39485400|title=Economics of the Public Sector|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph|date=2000|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=|isbn=0393966518|edition= 3rd|location=New York|pages=86–88|oclc=39485400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to provide public and merit goods, the government has to buy input factors from private companies, e.g. police cars, school buildings, uniforms etc. This process is called government or public procurement.

=== Problems ===
Government procurement involves a high risk of [[corruption]] because of the great size of financial turnover and the complexitiy of many procurement processes in which businesses interact very closely with politicians and civil servants. Often the personal interests of the public officials are not the same as the interests of the public. Such a conflict of interest problem, known as the [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent-problem]], increases the risk of corruption. According to [[OECD]], the highest percentage of bribery cases occur in the area of public procurement to influence the awarding of public contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/Corruption-Public-Procurement-Brochure.pdf|title=Preventing Corruption in Public Procurement|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=OECD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption in public procurement causes inefficiencies and high costs to the public. In order to prevent corruption and to ensure transparency and competition among suppliers, public procurement is subject to legal regulation.

===Scope===
Government procurement regulations normally cover all [[public works]], services and supply contracts entered into by a public authority. However, there may be exceptions. These most notably cover [[military acquisition]]s, which account for large parts of government expenditures. The GPA and EU procurement law allow of exceptions where public tendering would violate a country's essential security interests. Additionally, certain politically or economically sensitive sectors, such as public health, energy supply or public transport, may also be treated differently.&lt;ref name="Prieß: Global Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prieß|first=Hans-Joachim|author2=Harvey, Diana|author3=Friton, Pascal|title=Global Overview|journal=Prieß (2012)|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
The procedure of government procurement in Brazil is regulated for a lot of different laws with different procedures depending on the importance and the value of the procurement. The most important law about government procurement which contains basic rules of public procurements and administrative contracts is the Law nº 8.666, 21 june 1993, which contains rules for public tenders and for restricted tenders. There are other different rules to regulate procurement public services, as Law nº 8.987, 13 february 1995 (Concession and Permission of Public Services); Law nº 12.462, 4 august 2011 (Differentiated Procurement - RDC in portuguese) and Law nº 10.520, 17 july 2002, with deal with presential auction. In the internet field (e-procurement) there are executive orders (Decretos) which regulate public procurement as Decree nº 5.450, 31 may 2005 and Decree nº 7.982, 23 january 2013. This latter regulates the procedure of specific situations of sharing acquisitions of goods or under portioned deliverings.&lt;ref&gt;All information can be found in https://www.comprasgovernamentais.gov.br/index.php/legislacao&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Public procurement in Canada is regulated on various governmental levels (federal, provincial, municipal). Most federal procurement is organized by the [[Public Services and Procurement Canada]] (PSPC) agency and is governed by their Code of Conduct of Procurement in combination with principles laid out in the Federal Accountability Act and in the Financial Administration Act. Public procurement is guided by the principles of fairness, transparency, openness, and non-discrimination and complies with all international agreements that Canada is a member of (WTO [[Agreement on Government Procurement|Government Procurement Agreement]] [GPA], [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]], and various bilateral FTAs). Foreign suppliers from member nations to these agreements can bid on Canadian government procurements and are treated the same as domestic suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html|title=Code of Conduct for Procurement.

The principal statutory provisions regulating government procurement are:

*Department of Public Works and Government Services Act (1996)
*Financial Administration Act (1985) and the Government Contracts Regulations &lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html Government Contracts Regulations], accessed 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
*Defence Production Act 1985 (consolidated version published 2011) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207971 Defence Production Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. D-1) (consolidated version of January 30, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, bids must be solicited by the procuring department unless estimated expenditure does not exceed $25,000, or $100,000 "where the contract is for the acquisition of architectural, engineering and other services required in respect of the planning, design, preparation or supervision of the construction, repair, renovation or restoration of a work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/page-2.html#docCont Government Contracts Regulation 6b], accessed 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; For contracts above $25,000, tenders are published on the transparent Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS). A non-competitive procurement process is only used in certain special circumstances. One such area of exception are security-related procurements. In that case the Defence Production Act applies, which allows using a special process and favouring domestic suppliers in acquiring defence supplies and conducting defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://buyandsell.gc.ca/for-businesses/selling-to-the-government-of-canada/the-procurement-process|title=The Procurement Process|last=Engagement|first=Government of Canada, Public Works and Government Services Canada, Acquisitions Branch, Office of Small and Medium Enterprises and Strategic|website=buyandsell.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Timor===
The Ministry of Finance in [[East Timor]] or Timor-Leste is responsible for the oversight of government procurement.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Finance, [https://www.mof.gov.tl/government-procurement/?lang=en Procurement], accessed 13 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Government uses the Timor-Leste eProcurement Portal  for purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eprocurement.gov.tl/public/indexeprtl?&amp;lang=en Timor-Leste eProcurement Portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopia===
Government procurement in [[Ethiopia]] is governed by the Ethiopian Federal Government Procurement and Property Administration Proclamation No.649/2009,&lt;ref name=Eth&gt;[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4f0l6J9WQrBYzNmZmJiZjEtYjkyYS00NjhiLWFkMmEtOTA5NjdjMTdkNGEz/view Ethiopian Federal Government Procurement and Property Administration Proclamation], 9 September 2009, accessed 6 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the proclamation on Procedures of Public Procurement and Establishing its Supervisory Agency, Proclamation No. 430/2005. The Public Procurement
and Property Administration Agency advises the federal government on "on all public procurement and property administration policies, principles and implementation" and provides "technical assistance to the regional governments and city administrations".&lt;ref name=Eth /&gt;

===European Union===
{{Main|Government procurement in the European Union}}
Government procurement in the European Union accounts for more than EUR 2.2 trillion, or 14% of the EU GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement_en|title=Public Procurement - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been regulated and harmonized by [[European Union law|community law]] since the 1970s in order to guarantee transparency and non-discrimination of EU companies in government procurement in all member states. EU laws apply only to tenders that exceed certain thresholds in value. These thresholds vary depending on the area the contract is for and if the procurement is done by a central government or by other public authorities (e.g. municipal government). National laws are applied for tenders below these threshold values.&lt;ref name="Rules &amp; procedures"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/public-tenders/rules-procedures/index_en.htm|title=Rules &amp; procedures|website=Your Europe - Business|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant EU Directives regarding government procurement currently in force are [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1415011920358&amp;uri=CELEX:32009L0081 Directive 2009/81], [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014L0024 Directive 2014/24], and [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014L0025 Directive 2014/25].

There are five different procedures for public procurement:&lt;ref name="Rules &amp; procedures"/&gt;

*Open procedure: any company is allowed to submit a tender
*Restricted procedure: only companies that have been preselected are allowed to submit a tender
*Negotiated procedure: there are direct negotiations with at least three companies
*Competitive dialogue: if it is not possible to define technical specifications at the beginning, a competitive dialogue with at least three companies is started after which tenders can be submitted. This procedure is applied for complex procurements.
*Electronic auctions: companies that pass a pre-evaluation process can bid in electronic auctions for public contracts

The European Commission is working on further improving efficiency and transparency in government procurement in the EU with its current public procurement strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/strategy_en|title=Public procurement strategy - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Austria====
Government procurement in [[Austria]] is regulated by the Federal Procurement Act 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Stalzer, J., [https://www.schoenherr.eu/publications/publication-detail/austria-imminent-implementation-of-public-procurement-directives/ Austria: Imminent implementation of public procurement directives], accessed 14 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium|Belgian]] legislation on public procurement is set out in the Act of 17 June 2016 implementing the 2014 EU procurement directives.&lt;ref&gt;International Comparative Legal Guide, [https://iclg.com/practice-areas/public-procurement-laws-and-regulations/belgium Public Procurement 2018: Belgium], accessed 27 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws of 17 June 2016 on public procurement and on concession contracts, and the Law of 16 February 2017 on remedies, failed to meet the EU's transposition deadline (18 April 2016). [[Royal order (Belgium)|Royal Decree]]s issued on 18 April 2017 for general public procurement, 18 June 2017 for procurement in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors, 22 June 2017 containing new rules on the performance of public works contracts and concession contracts for public works and 25 June 2017, for the award and performance of concession contracts, have augmented the earlier laws.&lt;ref name=vbb&gt;Van Bael and Bellis, [https://www.vbb.com/media/Insights_Articles/VBB_Memorandum_Public_Procurement_27_07_2017.pd.pdf New Belgian Regulatory Framework Governing Public Procurement – Overview of Main Novelties], accessed 29 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 51 of the Royal Decree of 18 April 2017 includes a "revolving door mechanism", which targets the situation where a person previously working for a contracting authority is now being employed by an economic operator involved in a public procurement procedure established by that contracting authority. In this type of situation the person would be presumed to have a [[conflict of interest]] for a two-year period following the termination of his/her employment with the contracting authority.&lt;ref name=vbb /&gt;

====Bulgaria====
Government procurement in Bulgaria is a critical area in corruption risk. Public procurement contracts have been awarded to a handful of companies amid widespread irregularities, procedure violations and tailor-made selection or award criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/bg.pdf|title=Public procurement in Bulgaria|work=Study on administrative capacity in the EU|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian public procurement portal reported in September 2016 that since the beginning of 2016, "a total of 15,105 contracts were signed on the basis of public procurement orders".&lt;ref&gt;Sofia News Agency, [http://www.novinite.com/articles/176510/15%2C105+Public+Procurement+Contracts+Signed+So+Far+in+2016 15,105 Public Procurement Contracts Signed So Far in 2016], accessed 1 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2015, the [[Bulgarian government]] announced a 130-kilometer extension to the barbed wire [[Bulgarian border barrier|border fence]] along its border with [[Turkey]] in order to completely secure the land border.

Under [[Croatian law]], procurement procedures must be carried out by authorised representatives of the contracting authority, of whom at least one must hold a valid procurement certificate.

====Cyprus====
The Public Procurement Directorate of the Treasury of the [[Republic of Cyprus]] is responsible for procurement policy.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury of the Republic, [http://www.treasury.gov.cy/treasury/PublicPro/ppro.nsf/dmlindex_en/dmlindex_en Public Procurement], accessed 24 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Government procurement in the [[Czech Republic]] is regulated by Act No. 134/2016 Coll., on Public Contracts, signed by the [[President of the Czech Republic|President of the Republic]] on 22 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Zeman, M., [http://law.vozab.com/czech-en/168-new-act-no-134-2016-coll-on-public-procurement New act no. 134/2016 Coll. on public procurement], Vozáb &amp; Co., accessed 16 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
[[Economic operator]]s who are dissatisfied with the conduct of public procurement activity in [[Denmark]] may complain to the Klagenævnet for Udbud (Public Procurement Complaints Board).

====Estonia====
The [[Estonia]]n [[Ministry of Finance (Estonia)|Ministry of Finance]] is responsible for public procurement policy, drafting the law, providing supervision and consultancy, and maintains a central Public Procurement Register.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Finance, [https://riigihanked.riik.ee/register/ E-Procurement Estonia: Procurement Register], accessed 14 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The current legislation is the Public Procurement Act of 2017, which came into effect on 1 September 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Riigi Teataja, [https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/505092017003/consolide Public Procurement Act 2017], accessed 14 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and which operates in conjunction with the Public Information Act of 2000, which regulates the publication of "information concerning public procurements which are being organised or have been organised by the state or local governments".&lt;ref&gt;Riigi Teataja, [https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/514112013001/consolide Public Information Act 2000], section 28(1)(20)&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes are handled by the Public Procurements Appeal Committee.

Defence procurement for the Defence Forces, [[Ministry of Defence (Estonia)|Ministry of Defence]], [[Estonian Defence League|Defence League]], Defence Resources Agency and Estonian War Museum is organised by the Estonian Centre for Defence Investment, whose purpose is "to carry out procurement activities through ... professional-quality procurement and to use dedicated funds sparingly and prudently".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaitseministeerium.ee/en/organisation-contacts/centre-defence-investments/defence-procurement Defence Procurement], accessed 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre for Defence Investment was established by the decree of the Minister of Defence on 9 November 2015 and became operational on 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaitseministeerium.ee/en/organisation-contacts/centre-defence-investment Centre for Defence Investment], accessed 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
In [[Finland]] the following legislation applies to government procurement:
*Act on Public Contracts and Concession Contracts (Act no. 1397 of 2016, effective 1 January 2017) &lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, [http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2016/en20161397.pdf Act on Public Procurement and Concession Contracts], accessed 31 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

A Government Decree on Public Contracts was also in force until 2017.&lt;ref name=Finland /&gt;

The [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (Finland)|Ministry of Employment and the Economy]] is responsible for the preparation of legislation concerning public procurement. The Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (FCCA) oversees public procurement: section 139 of the Act on Public Procurement and Concession Contracts mandates the FCCA to supervise compliance with public contracts legislation and to provide 'administrative guidance' or if necessary to issue a caution to a non-compliant public authority.&lt;ref&gt;FCCA, [https://www.kkv.fi/en/current-issues/press-releases/2018/26.6.2018-fcca-reprimands-riihimaki-and-vaasa-for-failing-to-invite-tenders-for-procurement-contracts/ FCCA reprimands Riihimäki and Vaasa for failing to invite tenders for procurement contracts], published 6 June 2018, accessed 31 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Market Court operates as a specialist court handling public procurement cases. The Market Court's rulings in public procurement cases can be appealed to the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Finland]].&lt;ref name=Finland /&gt;

The Act on Electronic Auctions and Dynamic Purchasing Systems of 17 June 2011, which entered into force on 1 October 2011, introduced new procurement procedures, whereby documents relating to procurement would be sent and received exclusively online. This legislation included the use of [[Eauction|eAuction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2014-06/eGov%20in%20FI%20-%20May%202014%20-%2016.0.pdf eGovernment in Finland, May 2014], accessed 31 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic procurement is now covered within the 2016 Act on Public Contracts.

Transposition of the 2014 EU public procurement directive into Finnish law was delayed after the deadline (18 April 2016) with the consequence that some aspects of the directive were directly applicable from April 2016 until the new Finnish legislation was in place from 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Merilampi, [http://www.merilampi.com/the-reform-of-the-act-on-public-contracts-the-finnish-legislation-is-delayed/?lang=en The reform of the Act on Public Contracts – the Finnish legislation is delayed], published 28 April 2016, accessed 27 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
In France, the Department of Legal Affairs (DAJ) of the [[French Ministry for the Economy and Finance|Ministry for the Economy and Finance]] ([[French language|French]]: ''Ministère de l'Économie et des Finances'') is responsible for establishing regulations regarding public procurement (''la commande publique''). All currently relevant EU directives have been implemented into national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economie.gouv.fr/daj/commande-publique|title=Commande publique|work=Le portail des ministères économiques et financiers|access-date=2018-06-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
In Germany, the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie'', abbreviated BMWi) is responsible for defining laws and principles regarding public procurement. In 2016 Germany transposed the new EU Directives of 2014 into domestic law. Thereby, processes and contracts in public procurement have become easier and more flexible. The Act against Restraints of Competition - Part IV (German: ''[[:de:Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen|Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen]]'', abbreviated GWB) and the Ordinance on the Award of Public Contracts (German: [[:de:Vergabeverordnung|V''erordnung über die Vergabe öffentlicher Aufträge'']], abbreviated VgV) regulate procurement above EU thresholds. Detailed procedures are specified in further regulations, e.g. the Procurement Regulation for Public Works (German abbreviation: [[:de:Vergabe- und Vertragsordnung für Bauleistungen|VOB]]), the Procurement Regulation for Public Supplies and Services ([[:de:Vergabe- und Vertragsordnung für Leistungen|VOL]]), and the Procurement Regulation for Professional Services ([[:de:Vergabeordnung für freiberufliche Leistungen|VOF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Dossier/public-procurement.html|title=Public Procurement|last=|first=|date=|website=Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many contracts electronic procurement is made possible via an [https://www.evergabe-online.de/start.html?0 online platform].

For public procurement below the EU thresholds there are different regulations. At the federal level national budgetary law applies while the 16 federal German states and some municipalities have their own public procurement laws and regulations. This decentralized system reflects the political decentralization in Germany. However, sub-national level procurement regulations often take national regulations as examples and also ensure competition, non-discrimination, and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/de.pdf|title=Public Procurement - Germany Country Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government procurement in [[Gibraltar]] is managed by the Procurement Office, an independent office of [[Her Majesty's Government of Gibraltar|Her Majesty's Government of Gibraltar]] which reports directly to the Financial Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Gibraltar, [https://gibraltar.gov.gi/new/procurement-office Procurement Office], accessed 5 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
Law 4412/2016 on public procurement and Law 4413/2016 on concessions are the main instruments of [[Greece|Greek]] legislation governing public procurement. These two laws of 2016, along with earlier reforms introduced under Law 4281/2014 on public procurement law, have radically simplified the previously complex legal regime, repealing numerous previous laws.&lt;ref&gt;International Comparative Legal Guides, [https://iclg.com/practice-areas/public-procurement-laws-and-regulations/greece Public Procurement 2018: Greece], published 26 January 2018, accessed 6 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission's profile for [[Greece]] in its study of administrative capacity in the EU had described the public procurement system in the country as "singularly complex, ... being dispersed among as many as 400 laws, regulations, and presidential decrees".&lt;ref name=profile&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/el.pdf Public procurement – Study on administrative capacity in the EU: Greece Country Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Public contract notices are published in the Central Electronic Registry for Public Procurement (KIMDIS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/WorkingGroups/workinggroup4/2016-August-22-24/Contributions_NV/Greece_EN.pdf Hellenic Single Public Procurement Authority], accessed 6 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The Public Procurement Monitoring Unit (PPMU), established in 1997, part of the Centre of International and European Economic Law in [[Thessaloniki]], provides Greek contracting authorities with "specialised and prompt legal advisory support on awarding public works and technical services contracts falling within the scope of EU Law on Public Procurement".&lt;ref name=profile /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mopadis.cieel.gr/index.jsp?extLang=LG Public Procurement Monitoring Unit: Welcome], accessed 6 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====
The [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Public Procurement Authority was established by Act XL of 1995 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kozbeszerzes.hu/english/ Public Procurement Authority of Hungary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the current Public Procurement Act (Act CXLIII of 2015) entered into force on November 1, 2015, implementing the 2014 EU procurement directives.&lt;ref name=cxliii&gt;[https://www.procurementinet.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Public-Procurement-Act-Hungary.pdf Act CXLIII of 2015 on Public Procurement], accessed 13 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the 2015 legislation are:
*to secure transparency and public control of the effective use of public funds;
*to establish conditions of fair competition in public procurement;
*to enhance the access of local small and medium-sized enterprises to procurement procedures; and
*to promote environmental protection and the social considerations of the State.&lt;ref name=cxliii /&gt;
Concession award procedures are also covered within the same legislation, and the fundamental principles set out in Act V of 2013 on the [[Civil Code]], the "ultimate instrument relating to the operation of civil persons and economic organizations", also apply to public procurement.&lt;ref&gt;Borsy Association of Lawyers, [http://borsyugyveditarsulas.hu/en/magyar-az-uj-polgari-torvenykonyvrol/ The New Civil Code of Hungary], accessed 13 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
Public procurement in [[Italy]] is primarily regulated by the Public Contracts Code, which is administered by the [[Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport (Italy)|Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: Ministero delle infrastrutture e dei trasporti).

===Rwanda===
In [[Rwanda]], the public procurement process is managed on daily basis by an autonomous organ, the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA),&lt;ref&gt;Law N°25/2011 of 30/06/2011 establishing the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) and determining its mission, organization and Functioning&lt;/ref&gt; which operates under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN). Public procurement is regulated by the Law N°12/2007 of 27/03/2007 on public procurement &lt;ref&gt;Published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda, N°8 of 15/04/2007&lt;/ref&gt; which was modified and complemented by the Law N°05/20013 of 13/02/2013.&lt;ref&gt;Published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda, N°16 of 22/04/2013&lt;/ref&gt; The law is implemented by a Ministerial Order N°001/14/10/TC of 19/02/2014 establishing Regulations on Public Procurement, Standard Bidding Documents and Standard Contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda, N°10 of 10/03/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Rwanda has a decentralized public procurement system whereby procuring entities (central government organs, local government entities, government projects, commissions, public institutions, parastatals, agencies or any other government entity charged by the Chief Budget Manager to manage public funds) have the power to conduct directly their public procurement process. The main mission of RPPA is (1) to process the establishment and improvement of public procurement legal framework, (2) provide public procurement legal advisory services, (3) conduct audit and monitoring of public procurement activities carried out by procuring entities(tender award and contract management) and (4) build the capacity of public officials involved in public procurement activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rppa.gov.rw Rwanda Public Procurement Authority]&lt;/ref&gt;

The public procurement system in Rwanda is governed by 6 fundamental principles namely (1) transparency, (2) competition,(3) economy, (4) efficiency, (5) fairness and (6) accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 of the Law N°12/2007 of 27/03/2207 on public procurement as modified and complemented to date&lt;/ref&gt; In the national system, bidders have the right to appeal against public procurement procedures they may think were not conducted appropriately. In that connection, the legal framework provides for the Independent Review Panels at National Level (National Independent Review Panel) and at District Level (Independent Review Panel at District Level).&lt;ref&gt;Article 14 of the Law N°05/2013 OF 13/02/2013 modifying and complementing the Law N°12/2007 of 27/03/2007 on public procurement&lt;/ref&gt; The Independent Review Panels are composed of members from the Private Sector, Civil Society and the Public Sector, and the members from the Public Sector cannot form the majority of members of the Panel. The Independent Review Panel at National Level is under the supervision of the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning whereas the Independent Review Panel at District Level is under the supervision of the District Council.

In order to make the procurement sector a profession in Rwanda, there is an Association of Procurement Professionals which was established by the Law N°011/2016 of 02/05/2016.&lt;ref&gt;Published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda, N°21 of 23/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Rwanda introduced an e-procurement system in 2016. For more information about Rwanda's e-procurement system please visit [http://www.umucyo.gov.rw www.umucyo.gov.rw]; for more information about public procurement in Rwanda in general, please visit [http://www.rppa.gov.rw www.rppa.gov.rw].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3916">The '''Hotel Elysée''' is a [[New York City]] hotel situated on 60 East [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] between [[Madison Avenue|Madison]] and [[Park Avenue]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. The hotel was founded in 1926 as a [[Europe]]an-style hotel for the carriage trade by [[Swiss people|Swiss]]-born Max Haering.

==History==
Hotel Elysée was founded in 1926 as a [[Europe]]an-style hotel for the carriage trade by [[Swiss people|Swiss]]-born [[Max Haering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Jean Nathan |publication-date=December 18, 1994 |title=Monkey Business |work= [[New York Times]] |page=662 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/magazine/monkey-business.html |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York's leading hatcheck concessionaire, Mayer Quain, purchased the hotel out of bankruptcy in 1937. After the War, his children eclectically designed every room so that no two rooms were alike. In lieu of traditional numbers, the rooms were named to reflect their personality, such as the "Sayonara" suite assigned to [[Marlon Brando]] after his starring role in ''Teahouse of the August Moon''. [[Tennessee Williams]] lived in the hotel for fifteen years and died in the "Sunset" suite.

Columnist [[Jimmy Breslin]], who regards the Elysée as "a great hotel, a genuine New York landmark," succeeded Ruark as the hotel's unofficial chronicler. Upon Tennessee Williams's death at the Elysée in February 1983, Breslin recalled the story of a transient guest who called the front desk at 5:00 am complaining that someone in the next suite was keeping her awake by typing all night. "They knew right away who the culprit was, but they couldn't very well ask Mr. Williams to stop playwriting, so we simply moved the guest to another room."

In November 1948, Tallulah Bankhead celebrated President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s stunning victory over [[Thomas E. Dewey]] by throwing a noisy party at the hotel that ran non-stop for five days and nights.

==The Monkey Bar==
The Elysée is known for the Monkey Bar, a [[piano bar]] just off the lobby. Opened in the 1940s, it became known to the cognoscenti as "the place to go where jokes die," especially off-color jokes and double-entendre songs spun by such performers as [[Johnny Payne (musician)|Johnny Payne]] (1934-1964), Marion Page (1950-1965) and [[Mel Martin]] (1945-1983). Johnny Andrews played the piano at cocktail hour for over 50 years (1936-1990).

Starting out as just another dimly lit hotel piano bar with mirrored paneling, the tiny room was expanded in the early 1950s when the mirrors were replaced by wraparound hand-painted [[mural]] by [[caricaturist]] Charlie Vella . Eight more monkeys were added to the bar mural in 1984 by artist Diana Voyentzie "to remind customers of their behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Elizabeth Quinn Brown |publication-date=August 2013 |title=New York's Narrative |work= [[Quest (lifestyle magazine)|Quest]] |page=141 |url=http://issuu.com/questmag/docs/quest_aug2013 |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publication-date=2013 |title=Mizner Palm Beach Bricktops |work =dianevoyentziemonkeys.com|url=http://dianevoyentziemonkeys.com/aboutthemonkeys.html |accessdate= January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, when the bar was redesigned by the architect David Rockwell, all of the monkeys were unified by Voyentzie with more monkeys and palm trees and foliage. The monkeys in the mural depict decidedly human features riding [[elephant]]s, crouching under a Christmas tree, mixing up [[banana daiquiri]]s for tough-looking monkey-like customers, etc. In successive years, other artists have added to the tableau.

'''Héctor Horacio Magnetto''' (born July 9, 1944) is an Argentine executive [[CEO]] of the [[Grupo Clarín|Clarín Group]], the country's largest media company.

==Life and career==
Magnetto was born in [[Chivilcoy]] in 1944, and enrolled at the [[University of La Plata]], where he earned a degree in [[accountancy]] with high honors.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://www.grupoclarin.com/content/dir_magnetto_01.html Grupo Clarín: Héctor Magnetto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608070940/http://www.grupoclarin.com/content/dir_magnetto_01.html# |date=2011-06-08 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became affiliated with the pro-industry political party, the [[Integration and Development Movement]] (MID), and on March 2, 1972, was hired as an advisor to [[Ernestina Herrera de Noble]], the director and majority owner of ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', the most widely circulated newspaper in Latin America.&lt;ref name=funding&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Grupo-Clariacute;n-SA-Company-History.html Funding Universe: Grupo Clarín]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its large circulation, ''Clarín'' suffered financial difficulties when Mrs. Noble inherited the director's post from its founder, [[Roberto Noble]], as his widow. She turned to one of the latter's most prominent allies, economist and wholesaler [[Rogelio Julio Frigerio]], who lent ''Clarín'' US$10 million in 1971. The paper continued to endorse Frigerio's centrist MID platform, which centered on government support for infrastructure investment and [[import substitution industrialization]]. On Frigerio's advice, Mrs. Noble brought in Magnetto, who took later charge of the newspaper's finances.&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

The young accountant persuaded Mrs. Noble to shed superfluous assets, such as a company helicopter, and to begin negotiations with the Mitre, Paz, and Peralta Ramos families (owners of ''[[La Nación (Buenos Aires)|La Nación]]'', ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'' and ''[[La Razón (Buenos Aires)|La Razón]]'', respectively) to take part in a federally sponsored establishment of a [[newsprint]] manufacturer. The plan, which would cut costs by eliminating the need for imported newsprint, ultimately resulted in the inaugural of the ''[[Papel Prensa]]'' newsprint facility in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1007629 ''La Nación'': Más que un hombre de negocios] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetto served as CEO of Papel Prensa, on an alternating basis with the director of ''La Nación'', during subsequent years. He displaced most of his fellow MID-oriented colleagues at the newspaper in 1981, and afterwards became President and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artepolitica.com/comunidad/jorge-asis-sobre-clarin/ Arte Política: Jorge Asís sobre Clarín] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keen to political trends, Magnetto spearheaded Clarín's vocal opposition to the administration of the populist-turned-conservative President, [[Carlos Menem]], after the latter's re-election in 1995. He nevertheless maintained cordial relations with the runner-up of that campaign, [[Justicialist Party]] Governor [[Eduardo Duhalde]], who was appointed President by the [[Argentine Congress]] following the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]] that led to his predecessor's ([[Fernando De la Rua]]) resignation. Magnetto was able to parlay this understanding into Duhalde's support for a "Law of Preservation of Cultural Patrimony," which limited foreign ownership of local media to 30%, and thus protected the Clarín Group's core businesses. The group had suffered steep losses during the [[Argentine economic crisis|1999-2002 crisis]], and the bill (passed in July 2003, and dubbed the "Clarín Law" by detractors), helped solidify its finances.&lt;ref name=que&gt;[http://www.queescomunicacion.com.ar/Noticias/NoticiaMuestra.asp?Id=1386 ''Qué es Comunicación'': Radiocomunicación o teledifusión] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025173546/http://www.queescomunicacion.com.ar/Noticias/NoticiaMuestra.asp?Id=1386# |date=2008-10-25 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company recovered alongside the [[Argentine economy]] in subsequent years, and by 2006, had acquired Cablevisión, its Multicanal cable unit's leading competitor.&lt;ref name=que/&gt; Magnetto, however, was beset by worsening health problems, chief among them a dignosis of [[esophageal cancer]] in early 2007, which for a time led to speculation as to his continuity as CEO of the Clarín group, as well as to a possible dispute over his 30% share in the company. Magnetto reacted positively to treatment, and underwent subsequent [[speech therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revista-noticias.com.ar/comun/nota.php?art=406&amp;ed=1587|title=La enfermedad que sacude al poder|publisher=''Noticias''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was on hand for the October 22, 2007, Clarín [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] in the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]], and continued to preside over the group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/10/22/um/m-01524573.htm ''Clarín'' (22 Oct 2007)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former President [[Néstor Kirchner]] alleged that, during the [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector]], Magnetto offered a supportive spin on the administration's case for higher export [[tariff]]s, in exchange for an amenable treatment of the media group's acquisition of a significant stake in [[Telecom Argentina]] (a potential [[anti-trust law]] violation); the hitherto cordial relations between [[Kirchnerism]] and the Clarín Group [[Controversies between Clarín and Kirchnerism|soured during the conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/news/stock-alert/grcnl_-argentina-ex-president-clarin-offered-spin-for-telephone-co-725534.html Trading Markets: Argentina Ex-President: Clarín Offered Spin For Telephone Co]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Magnetto was one of 200 individuals investigated by the government for [[money laundering]], mainly related to [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticadigital.com/index.php?secc=nota&amp;nid=21260 ''Crítica de la Argentina'': Los 200 investigados por lavado de dinero en la República Argentina] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618142815/http://www.criticadigital.com/index.php?secc=nota&amp;nid=21260# |date=2009-06-18 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetto was named in a 2010 testimony by Lidia Papaleo, whose husband [[David Graiver]] owned Papel Prensa from 1973 until his death in 1976, as a key instigator of her torture by the police in 1977; Papaleo cited this incident as the cause for her sale at the time of her shares in ''[[La Opinión (Argentina)|La Opinión]]'' and Papel Prensa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agenciapacourondo.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=952:carta-de-lidia-papaleo-la-verdad-de-papel-prensa&amp;catid=42:derechos-humanos-y-memoria-&amp;Itemid=63|title=Carta de Lidia Papaleo (La verdad de Papel Prensa)|publisher=Agencia Paco Urondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper Clarin published that Papaleo "recanted her testimony,"  violating every ethical standard of journalism. In fact, Papaleo confirmed that she and her family were under great psychological pressure and forced to sell Papel Prensa in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Papaleo-Justicia-venta-Papel-Prensa_0_323967818.html|title=Papaleo declaró en la Justicia que estaba libre cuando vendió Papel Prensa|publisher=''Clarín''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetto was declared innocent in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1967747-papel-prensa-sobreseyeron-a-bartolome-mitre-hector-magnetto-y-ernestina-herrera-de-noble|title= Papel Prensa: sobreseyeron a Bartolomé Mitre, Héctor Magnetto y Ernestina Herrera de Noble|trans-title=|language= Spanish|author= |date= December 16, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leo Wainstein''' (4 January 1883 – 13 March 1978) was an [[Ukrainian Jewish]] [[jurist]] and businessman who lived most part of his life in [[Finland]].

Wainstein was born in [[Yalta]] to a Jewish peasant family. He graduated as jurist in [[Odessa University]] in 1910 and worked in the field until 1916, when he got involved into [[wool]] business through his marriage to Regina née Tilling. After the [[October Revolution]] the couple moved to Finland, where Wainstein made a successful career in textile industry. His business started to decline in the 1950s, and after this he changed to hat industry for a few years before his retirement.

Wainstein had [[Italian citizenship]], and he died in Rome on 13 March 1978.

== Early life and career in Russian Empire ==
Wainstein was born in [[Yalta]], [[Russian Empire]] to a Jewish family. His parents were farmer Josef Wainstein and Lia née Rabinowicz. The father died when Waintein was young and faced had difficulties at completing his studies. Eventually, Wainstein completed his upper secondary studies in 1906 and continued in Odessa University, where he graduated as jurist in 1910.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

Following to his graduation, Wainstein worked as jurist first in [[Odessa]] and later in Moscow. There he met Regina Trilling, who was a daughter of a [[Polish Jew]] wool trader Elias Trilling. Leo and Regina got married in 1915 and in the following year Leo Wainstein started working for his father-in-law's wool company. Wainstein learned wool business thoroughly and his work took him to the [[Nordic Countries]], UK, [[Belgium]], France, Italy and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

== Wool manufacturing in Finland ==
Wainstein's wool business came to end after the [[October Revolution]] and at late 1918 the couple decided to move to newly independent [[Finland]].

In 1919 Wainstein became owner and manager of wool company Ab Nordiska Ullkompaniet Oy. The Finnish textile industry was in trouble – in addition to the local market, the Finnish companies had sold large share of their production in Russia, and now this market area was closed. Despite of the difficulties, Wainstein developed the business determinedly.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

In 1924 Waintein took over Turun Verkatehdas Oy (''[[Turku]] Baize Factory'') from young businessman [[Wilhelm Wahlforss]], who had led the company unsuccessfully. At the time the company employed just 65 people, but Wainstein increased the production capacity of [[worsted yarn]] and woolen fabric by 45%, and the number of [[Spindle (textiles)|spindles]] was increased from 3,400 up to nearly 30,000. Waintein owned a German, [[Berlin]]-based subsidiary Nordische Woll GmbH.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

The company did well following the [[Second World War]] and upswing in economy, and the headcount in Turun Verkatehdas reached nearly 2,000 in the turn of the 1950s. Soon after this the situation turned worse: shortly after the company had bought a large stock of wool, the government started wool [[price regulation]]. Consequently, the raw material price dropped and the final products had to be priced accordingly. At the early 1950s the wool price dropped to one third of the previous peak level, and the company fell into trouble.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

Wainstein and the main financing bank [[Pohjoismaiden Yhdyspankki]] (PYP) started to seek a way out from the difficult situation. PYP continued funding the Turku baize factory partly because of Wainstein's good relationship to the bank's main director [[Rainer von Fieandt]], and partly because the company collapse would have meant a victory to another local competitor Barker-Littoinen Oy and its financier and [[Kansallis-Osake-Pankki]] (KOP), which was the main competitor of PYP. Waintein realised that the future did not look bright, and moved 51% of the company ownership to a foundation he had founded in 1952. The foundation board members were Wainstein, Fieandt and [[Sakari Tuomioja]], the director of [[Bank of Finland]]. The setup was tactically selected – after this the company was on a stable basis. Wainstein left his position as chairman in 1953 and Fieandt left in 1955. Turun Verkatehdas was merged to Villayhtymä Oy in 1960.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

== Hat business ==
Since the 1920s Wainstein had been involved in [[hatmaking]], being a board member of Oy Silfverbergin &amp; Wecksellin Yhdistetyt Hattutehtaat ("Silfverberg's &amp; Wecksell's United Hat Factories Ltd"). After leaving baize manufacturing, Wainstein got involved into [[Kristinestad]] located hat producer Oy M. Kotschack Ab together with his son Michael. Wainstein retired at the end of the 1960s, after which Leo and Regina Wainstein moved to Rome for the rest of their lives; Wainstein had had Italian citizenship since 1919.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wainstein's favourite hobbies were gardening, music and arts. He was great friend of Italy and worked as Italian [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Helsinki in 1919–1923. During 1949–1968 he was Italian Honorary Consul General. Wainstein contributed trade between the two countries as member of the Finnish–Italian [[Chamber of Commerce]]. Wainstein also took part in the Helsinki Jewish Congregation.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

== Leo and Regina Wainstein foundation ==
In 1928 Leo and Regina Wainstein founded foundation ''Leo ja Regina Wainsteinin säätiö'' to celebrate their tenth anniversary in Finland and as a gratitude to their new home country. The foundation had a significant amount of capital and it shared grants and funded a number of pieces of sculpture in Turku, Helsinki and [[Gothenburg]]. The foundation was ended in 2003&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt; after which it became part of the [[Finnish Cultural Foundation]] as Leo and Regina Wainstein Fund.&lt;ref name="SKR: Leo ja Regina Wainsteinin rahasto"/&gt;

[[Image:Lavazza 0002782 m.jpg|thumb|300px|Advertising for Lavazza, Transport of coffee in Indochina, ca 1900]]
'''Luigi Lavazza''' (24 April 1859 – 16 August 1949) was an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman.  In 1895, he founded the [[Lavazza]] coffee company in [[Turin]].

==Biography==
Lavazza was born in [[Murisengo]], a small city in the [[province of Turin]] ([[Piedmont]]).

The origins of the Lavazza firm go back to 1895, when Luigi Lavazza purchased a little [[grocery]] store, Paissa Olivero, in the old commercial section of [[Turin]] (Northern [[Italy]]). The purchase was made for 26,000 Italian Lire, or about US$20.

In those times such stores operated as both [[retail]] and production outlets. The [[coffee]], sold among thousands of other products, was bought raw, and then [[Coffee roasting|roasted]] and blended according to very personal [[recipe]]s depending on the customers' requests. This activity soon attracted the interest of Luigi Lavazza, who had already demonstrated considerable knowledge and skills in the processing of blends, including both the quantities of the ingredients and the degree of roasting. The firm's expansion from retailing to [[wholesale]] trade (1910), the joining of Luigi's three sons Mario, Beppe and Pericle (during the [[First World War]]), and the progressive narrowing of the production range marked the first steps of an irresistible commercial growth, which enabled the Firm to acquire a notable position at regional level. The little grocery store became in 1927 the modern Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. that, after the forced stop caused by the [[League of Nations|League of Nations']] [[economic sanction]]s, by the prohibition on the importation of coffee, and by the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], finally came to specialize in the production of coffee. The first Lavazza [[logo]] was then created and the annual production reached 1,000 tons.

In 1936 Luigi Lavazza retired and left the company to his children. He died in 1949.

Since his death his family, from generation to generation, has devoted its energy to coffee and today [[Lavazza]] is claimed to be the market leader of [[espresso]] in Italy (with almost 45% of the total coffee market in 2004) and is present in over 60 countries. It is still based in Turin and is controlled by the fourth generation of Lavazza's descendants.

Pierre married twice, first to Marie-Joséphine Sanout and later to Marie Thami. The Bissonnet were landowners in [[Gonaïves]], [[Saint-Domingue]] (currently Haiti) and had to flee amid a [[1804 Haiti Massacre|massacre against whites]] to [[San José de las Matas]], in the then-[[Era de Francia|French-administered Santo Domingo]] (currently the Dominican Republic).

'''Merck Millipore''' was the brand used for [[Merck KGaA|Merck]]'s global life science business until 2015 when the company re-branded. It was originally formed when Merck acquired the Millipore Corporation in 2010. Merck is a supplier to the life science industry. The '''Millipore Corporation''' was founded in 1954, and listed among the [[S&amp;P 500]] since the early 1990s, as an international [[bioscience]]s company, known widely for its [[micrometre|micrometer]] pore-size filters and tests. In 2015, Merck acquired [[Sigma-Aldrich]] and merged it with Merck Millipore. In the United States and Canada, the life science business is now known as MilliporeSigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Customer Letter|date=2014|publisher=EMD Millipore|url=http://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/about-us/news-media-room/customer-letter/h2qb.qB.D88AAAFIGctSpp69,nav|last1=Batra|first1=Udit|access-date=2016-07-13}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation===
{{POV section|date=September 2015}}
In the early 1950s Lovell Corporation won a contract from the U.S. Army Chemical Engineers to develop and manufacture membrane filtering devices and systems used to separate the molecular components of fluid samples. When the membranes were declassified in 1953 and offered for commercial use, Jack Bush, a Lovell employee, bought the company’s right to the technology for $200,000 and established the Millipore Filter Company which later changed its name to Millipore Corporation to reflect its growing range of products. In 2010, [[Merck KGaA]] the world's oldest chemical and pharmaceutical company- acquired Millipore Corporation to form EMD Millipore.

===Filters===
By 1959, Millipore made porous membrane filters of [[cellulose]] [[ester]]s or other materials which resembled paper in sheet form, and were brittle when dry but [[friable]] when wet.&lt;ref name="bassett"&gt;Bassett (1959). "''Peripheral Nerve and Spinal Cord Regeneration: Factors Leading to Success of a Tubulation Technique Employing Millipore''". Experimental Neurology 1: 386–406&lt;/ref&gt; Filters consisted of [[nitrocellulose]] or [[polycarbonate]] [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membrane]] [[nucleopore filter]]s ranging from [[Porosity|pore]] size of 0.2 μm ([[micrometre|micrometer]]) to 20&amp;nbsp;µm. Modern filter are [[Polyvinylidene fluoride]] and/or [[Polypropylene]] based.

===Growth===
By 1970, Millipore had established subsidiaries in seven countries. The company opened manufacturing plants in [[Jaffrey, New Hampshire]]; [[Molsheim]], France; [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland; and several other locations. Millipore’s 2006 acquisition of Serologicals Corporation improved the company's position in high-growth markets such as drug discovery products and services, antibodies, cell biology reagents, and stem cell research. As of the late 2000s, Millipore was the only company providing both upstream cell culture and downstream separations offerings for biopharmaceutical production{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

'''Microsoft Office PerformancePoint Server''' is a [[business intelligence]] [[Computer software|software]] product released in 2007 by [[Microsoft]].  The product was generally an integration of the acquisitions from [[ProClarity Corporation|ProClarity]] - the Planning Server and Monitoring Server - into Microsoft's SharePoint server product line.  Although discontinued in 2009, the dashboard, scorecard, and analytics capabilities of PerformancePoint Server were incorporated into [[Sharepoint 2010|SharePoint 2010]] and later versions.

PerformancePoint Server also provided a planning and budgeting component directly integrated with Excel.

==History==

Microsoft offered preview releases of PerformancePoint Server starting in mid-2006. Previews of the product were formed from Business Scorecard Manager 2005 and the Planning Server component. Acquisitions [[ProClarity Corporation|ProClarity]] and [[Great Plains Software|Great Plains]] brought additional analytics and planning/reporting capabilities, as well as companion products ProClarity 6.3 and [[Microsoft FRx|FRx]].

PerformancePoint Server was officially released in November 2007.

Microsoft discontinued PerformancePoint Server as an independent product in 2009 and folded its dashboard, scorecard and analytics capabilities into PerformancePoint Services in SharePoint Server 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/business_intelligence/analytics/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212902915&amp;subSection=Business+Intelligence |title=Microsoft Makes Sweeping Changes To BI Software Strategy |date=January 27, 2009 |last=Weier |first=Mary Hayes |work=[[InformationWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring Server Component==
Business monitoring capabilities, including dashboards, scorecards &amp; key performance indicators, navigable reports for deeper analysis, strategy maps, and linked filtering, are provided by PerformancePoint's Monitoring Server component. A Dashboard Designer application that is distributed from Monitoring Server enables business analysts or IT Administrators to:

* create &amp; test data source connections
* create views that use those data connections
* assemble the views into a dashboard
* deploy the dashboard as a [[SharePoint]] page

Dashboard Designer saved content and security information back to the Monitoring Server. Data source connections, such as OLAP cubes or relational tables, were also made through Monitoring Server.
 
After a dashboard has been published to the Monitoring Server database, it would be deployed as a SharePoint page and shared with other users as such. When the pages were opened in a web browser, Monitoring Server updated the data in the views by connecting back to the original data sources.

==Planning Server Component==
PerformancePoint's Planning Server component supported maintenance of logical business models, budget &amp; approval workflows, enterprise data sources, and it followed [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]].

Planning Server made use of Excel for input and line-of-business reporting, as well as SQL Server for storing and processing business models.

==Management Reporter Component==
The Management Reporter component was designed to perform financial reporting and can read PerformancePoint Planning models directly. A development kit was also available to allow this component to read other models .{{which|date=August 2013}}

'''Nicholas Negroponte''' (born December 1, 1943) is a [[Greek American]] architect.  He is the founder and Chairman Emeritus of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]], and also founded the [[One Laptop per Child]] Association (OLPC).

==Early life==
Negroponte was born to {{Interlanguage link multi|Dimitri John|el|3=Δημήτριος Νεγρεπόντης}} ({{lang-el|Νεγροπόντης}}), a Greek shipping magnate and alpine skier, and grew up in New York City's [[Upper East Side]]. He is the younger brother of [[John Negroponte]], former [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]]. Another brother [[Michel Negroponte]] is an [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[filmmaker]], and his other brother, George Negroponte, is an [[artist]] and was President of [[the Drawing Center]] from 2002-2007.

Negroponte joined the faculty of [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT]] in 1966. For several years thereafter he divided his teaching time between [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT]] and several visiting professorships at [[Yale University|Yale]], [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

In 1967, Negroponte founded [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT]]'s Architecture Machine Group, a combination lab and think tank which studied new approaches to [[human-computer interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[MIT Press]]| isbn = 0-262-64010-4| last = Negroponte| first = Nicholas| title = The Architecture Machine: Towards a More Human Environment| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Negroponte created the [[MIT Media Lab]] with [[Jerome B. Wiesner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 13| last = Schrage| first = Michael| title = An MIT Lab Tinkers With the Future of Personal Computers| work = [[The Washington Post]]| date = 1985-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he developed the lab into the pre-eminent computer science laboratory for new media and a high-tech playground for investigating the human-computer interface. Negroponte also became a proponent of [[intelligent agent]]s and personalized [[Online newspaper|electronic newspapers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn =0036-8733| volume = 265| issue = 3| pages = 76–83| last = Negroponte| first = Nicholas| title = Products and Services for Computer Networks| journal = [[Scientific American]]| year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he popularized the term the [[Daily Me]].

===''Wired''===
In 1992, Negroponte became involved in the creation of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' as the first investor. From 1993 to 1998, he contributed a monthly column to the magazine in which he reiterated a basic theme: "Move bits, not atoms."

Negroponte expanded many of the ideas from his ''Wired'' columns into a bestselling book ''[[Being Digital]]'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Knopf| isbn = 0-679-76290-6| last = Negroponte| first = Nicholas| title = Being Digital| location = New York| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made famous his forecasts on how the interactive world, the entertainment world and the information world would eventually merge. ''Being Digital'' was a bestseller and was translated into some twenty languages. Negroponte is a digital optimist who believed that computers would make life better for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Hirst, Martin and Harrison, John (2007) Communication and New Media, Oxford University Press, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  However, critics such as [[Cass Sunstein]]&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, C.R. (2001) Republic.com Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; have criticised his [[techno-utopianism|techno-utopian]] ideas for failing to consider the historical, political and cultural realities with which new technologies should be viewed.

In the 1980s Negroponte predicted that wired technologies such as telephones would become unwired by using airwaves instead of wires or fiber optics, and that unwired technologies such as televisions would become wired—a prediction commonly referred to as the [[Negroponte switch]].&lt;ref&gt;Speaking at a Northern Telecom meeting in the mid-80s with [[George Gilder]].  Negroponte called it "trading places" Gilder called it "The Negroponte Switch".  From ''Being Digital'', 1995, Negroponte, N.  {{ISBN|0-340-64930-5}} p 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
In 2000, Negroponte stepped down as director of the [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]] as [[Walter Bender]] took over as Executive Director. However, Negroponte retained the role of laboratory Chairman. When [[Frank Moss (technologist)|Frank Moss]] was appointed director of the lab in 2006, Negroponte stepped down as lab chairman to focus more fully on his work with [[The Children's Machine|One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) although he retains his appointment as professor at MIT.

[[Image:Kaye negroponte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mary Lou Jepsen]], [[Alan Kay]] and Nicholas Negroponte unveil the [[$100 laptop]] in November 2005.]]
In November 2005, at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] held in [[Tunis]], Negroponte unveiled the concept of a $100 laptop computer, [[The Children's Machine]], designed for students in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Kirkpatrick| first= David| date=2005-11-28| accessdate = 2010-12-12 | work=Fortune| url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/11/28/8361971/index.htm | title=I'd Like to Teach the World to Type}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price has increased to US$180, however. The project is part of a broader program by One Laptop Per Child, a non-profit organisation started by Negroponte and other [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]] faculty, to extend [[Internet]] access in developing countries.

Negroponte is an active [[angel investor]] and has invested in over 30 startup companies over the last 30 years, including [[Zagats]], [[Wired magazine|Wired]], [[Ambient Devices]], [[Skype]] and [[Velti]]. He has sat on several boards, including [[Motorola]] (listed on the New York Stock Exchange) and [[Velti]] (listed on the NASDAQ and formerly on the London Stock Exchange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Velti Announces Date of AIM Delisting|url=http://investors.velti.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=558800|accessdate=27 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305193039/http://investors.velti.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=558800|archivedate=5 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). He is also on the advisory board of [[TTI/Vanguard]]. In August 2007, he was appointed to a five-member special committee with the objective of assuring the continued journalistic and editorial integrity and independence of the [[Wall Street Journal]] and other [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] publications and services.  The committee was formed as part of the merger of Dow Jones with [[News Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wall Street Journal]], August 1, 2007.  "Text of Dow Jones Editorial Agreement". [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118598565803884843 Online edition] retrieved on October 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Negroponte's fellow founding committee members are [[Louis Boccardi]], [[Thomas Bray (writer)|Thomas Bray]], [[Jack Fuller (publisher)|Jack Fuller]], and the late former Congresswoman [[Jennifer Dunn (politician)|Jennifer Dunn]].

Negroponte has influenced modern day futurists, such as [[David Houle (futurist)|David Houle]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''One Sansome Street''', also known as '''Citigroup Center''', is an office [[skyscraper]] located at the intersection of Sutter and Sansome Streets in the [[Financial District (San Francisco)|Financial District]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]] near [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]]. The {{convert|168|m|abbr=on}}, 41 [[Storey|floor]],  {{convert|587,473|sqft|abbr=on}} office tower was completed in 1984.&lt;ref name="cbre-facts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbre.us/o/sanfrancisco/AssetLibrary/OneSansomeBrochure.pdf | title=One Sansome Street - Brochure | publisher=[[CBRE Group]] | accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The One Sansome Street tower is built adjacent to the site of the ornate Anglo and London Paris National Bank, which was completed in 1910.&lt;ref name="cbre-history"&gt;{{cite web | title= One Sansome Street – The Beginning | url=http://www.cbre.us/o/sanfrancisco/properties/one-sansome-street/Pages/project-history.aspx | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205190620/http://www.cbre.us/o/sanfrancisco/properties/one-sansome-street/Pages/project-history.aspx | archivedate=February 5, 2017 | publisher=[[CBRE Group]] | accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed by architect [[Albert Pissis]], the bank building was granite clad with {{convert|38|ft|abbr=on}} high [[Doric order|Doric columns]].  The historic architecture of the bank building serves as a conservatory for the skyscraper today.&lt;ref name="cbre-history"/&gt;

One Sansome Street was acquired by [[Beacon Capital Partners]] LLC from [[BayernLB]] in 2005 for $217 million or $394.55 per ft² ($4,247.32 per m²).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jillian Ambroz | title=Beacon Shopping Assets in Third Fund | url=http://www.costar.com/News/Article.aspx?id=29755D425CA00ECF52C946635C724731 | publisher=CoStar Group | date=January 19, 2007 | accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BayernLB bought the building in 1999 from subsidiaries of [[Citigroup]] and [[Dai-ichi Life|Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co.]] for between $170–175 million, or $310–320 per ft² ($3,337-3,445 per m²).&lt;ref name="CoStar"&gt;{{cite news | author=Lizette Wilson | title=Citicorp Center could fetch over $200 mil from hungry buyers | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2004/10/04/newscolumn6.html?page=2 | work=San Francisco Business Times | date=October 1, 2004 | accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, it was owned by Broadway Partners Fund Manager, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Portfolio | url=http://www.bwaypartners.com/portfolio.php | publisher=Broadway Partners Fund Manager, LLC | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, a partnership between Barker Pacific Group and Prudential Real Estate Investors took ownership of the building.&lt;ref name="citigroup lease"&gt;{{cite news | author=J.K.

{{original synthesis|article|date=March 2016}}

The '''open-source model''' is a decentralized [[software development]] model that encourages [[open collaboration]].&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Levine, Sheen S., &amp; Prietula, M. J. (2013). [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1096442 Open Collaboration for Innovation: Principles and Performance].

Raymond}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A main principle of [[open-source software development]] is [[peer production]], with products such as source code, [[blueprint]]s, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in [[open-source appropriate technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology |journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability |volume=14 |issue= 3|pages=425–431 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1517361|last1=Pearce |first1=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source drug discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/sreelatha-menon-researchers-sans-borders/00/19/350429/ "Science 2.0 is here as CSIR resorts to open-source drug research for TB" Business Standard, 1 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openwetware.org/wiki/OSDDMalaria:GSK_Arylpyrrole_Series:Story_so_far "Open Source Drug Discovery for Malaria Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;

Open source promotes universal access via an [[open-source license|open-source]] or [[free license]] to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakhani|first=K.R.|last2=von Hippel|first2=E.|year=June 2003|title=How Open Source Software Works: Free User to User Assistance|url=

''Open source'' gained hold with the rise of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2004}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[open-source software movement]] arose to clarify [[copyright]], [[License|licensing]], [[Domain name|domain]], and consumer issues.

Generally, open source refers to a [[computer program]] in which the [[source code]] is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a [[software license]]. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.

Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source movement, including the [[Apache Software Foundation]], which supports community projects such as the open-source framework [[Apache Hadoop]] and the open-source [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] server [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache HTTP]].

==History==
{{main|History of free and open-source software}}The sharing of technical information predates the [[Internet]] and the personal computer considerably. For instance, in the early years of automobile development a group of capital [[monopoly|monopolists]] owned the rights to a [[2 cycle|2-cycle]] gasoline-engine patent originally filed by [[George B. Selden]].&lt;ref name="carculture"&gt;{{cite book |author=James J. Flink |title=The Car Culture |publisher=MIT Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-262-56015-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By controlling this patent, they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands, or risk a lawsuit.

In 1911, independent automaker [[Henry Ford]] won a challenge to the Selden patent. The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association (which would eventually become the [[Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association]]) was formed.&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt; The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US automotive manufacturers: although each company would develop technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money among all the manufacturers.&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt; By the time the US entered [[World War II]], 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared among these manufacturers, without any exchange of money (or lawsuits).&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt;

Early instances of the free sharing of source code include [[IBM]]'s source releases of its [[operating system]]s and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s, and the [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software.&lt;ref name="autogenerated172"&gt;{{cite book|title=IBM and the U.S. Data Processing Industry: An Economic History|last=Fisher|first=Franklin M.|publisher=Praeger|year=1983|isbn=978-0-03-063059-0|pages=172–9|author2=James W. McKie|author3=Richard B. Mancke}} IBM unbundled (began charging for) software 23 June 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/ibm7090.html Dave Pitts' IBM 7090 support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827134534/http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/ibm7090.html |date=2015-08-27 }}{{spaced ndash}}An example of distributed source: Page contains a link to [[IBM 7090/94 IBSYS]] source, including [[COBOL]] and [[FORTRAN]] compilers.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1960s, [[ARPANET]] researchers used an open "[[Request for Comments]]" (RFC) process to encourage feedback in early telecommunication network protocols. This led to the birth of the early Internet in 1969.

The sharing of source code on the Internet began when the Internet was relatively primitive, with software distributed via [[UUCP]], [[Usenet]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]. [[BSD]], for example, was first widely distributed by posts to comp.os.linux on the Usenet, which is also where its development was discussed. [[Linux]] followed in this model.

The term "open source" was first proposed by a group of people in the [[free software movement]] who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = Stanford University| last = O'Mahony| first = Siobhan Clare| title = The emergence of a new commercial actor: Community managed software projects| location = Stanford, CA| date = 2002|pages=34–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ambiguity of the term "free software" was seen as discouraging business adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |quote=The problem with it is twofold. First, ... the term "free" is very ambiguous ... Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous.|author=[[Eric S. Raymond]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infoworld1983"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;f=false |website=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-23|title=Free software - Free software is a junkyard of software spare parts |quote=''"In contrast to commercial software is a large and growing body of free software that exists in the public domain.

The group included [[Christine Peterson]], [[Todd Anderson]], [[Larry Augustin]], [[Jon Hall (programmer)|Jon Hall]], [[Sam Ockman]], [[Michael Tiemann]] and [[Eric S. Raymond]]. Peterson suggested "open source" at a meeting&lt;ref name=osihistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI |date=19 September 2006 |first=Michael |last=Tiemann |authorlink=Michael Tiemann |publisher=[[Open Source Initiative]] |accessdate=23 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001164015/http://www.opensource.org/docs/history.php |archivedate=1 October 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; held at [[Palo Alto, California]], in reaction to [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]]'s announcement in January 1998 of a source code release for [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]]. [[Linus Torvalds]] gave his support the following day, and Phil Hughes backed the term in ''[[Linux Journal]]''. [[Richard Stallman]], the founder of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind.&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="rmsdissent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |publisher=fsf.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape released its source code under the [[Netscape Public License]] and later under the [[Mozilla Public License]].&lt;ref name="Muffatto000"&gt;{{cite book  | title = Open Source: A Multidisciplinary Approach  | first = Moreno  | last = Muffatto  | publisher = Imperial College Press  | year = 2006  | isbn = 978-1-86094-665-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term. He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998.&lt;ref name="raymondCall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, he founded The [[Open Source Initiative]] in collaboration with [[Bruce Perens]].&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt;

The term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]]. Originally titled the "Freeware Summit" and later known as the "Open Source Summit",&lt;ref name=opensourcesummit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |title=Open Source Summit |website=Linux Gazette |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2015-02-07 |first=Guido |last=van Rossum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229053622/http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |archivedate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, [[Larry Wall]], [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Eric Allman]], [[Guido van Rossum]], [[Michael Tiemann]], [[Paul Vixie]], [[Jamie Zawinski]], and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, alternatives to the term "free software" were discussed. Tiemann argued for "sourceware" as a new term, while Raymond argued for "open source". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening.&lt;ref name=opensourcesummit /&gt;

"Open source" has never managed to entirely supersede the older term "free software", giving rise to the combined term [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS).

==Economics==
{{main|Open-source economics}}
Some economists agree that open-source is an [[information good]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The economics and management of intellectual property : towards intellectual capitalism|last=Granstrand|first=Ove|publisher=E. Elgar|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85898-967-9|location=Cheltenham, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "knowledge good" with original work involving a significant amount of time, money, and effort. The cost of reproducing the work is low enough that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost{{spaced ndash}}this is referred to as the [[marginal cost]] of a product. [[Copyright]] creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production. This allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work. Copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost. Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a [[derivative work]]—such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature, or a [[remix]] of a song—but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so.

Being organized as effectively a "[[consumers' cooperative]]", open source eliminates some of the access costs of consumers and creators of derivative works by reducing the restrictions of copyright. Basic economic theory predicts that lower costs would lead to higher consumption and also more frequent creation of derivative works.  Organizations such as [[Creative Commons]] host websites where individuals can file for alternative "licenses", or levels of restriction, for their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/ |title=About The Licenses |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These self-made protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement.

Others argue that since consumers do not pay for their copies, creators are unable to recoup the initial cost of production and thus have little economic incentive to create in the first place. By this argument, consumers would lose out because some of the goods they would otherwise purchase would not be available. In practice, content producers can choose whether to adopt a proprietary license and charge for copies, or an open license. Some goods which require large amounts of professional research and development, such as the [[pharmaceutical industry]] (which depends largely on [[patent]]s, not copyright for intellectual property protection) are almost exclusively proprietary, although increasingly sophisticated technologies are being developed on open-source principles.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, ''[[Open-Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab]]: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs'', Elsevier, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that open-source development creates enormous value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/02/02/3d-printed-open-hardware-syringe-pump-value-800m/ 3D Printed Open Hardware Syringe Yields $800M Value, Study Finds]- ''3D Printing Industry'' 2-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the context of [[open-source hardware]] design, digital designs are shared for free and anyone with access to digital manufacturing technologies (e.g. [[RepRap]] 3D printers) can replicate the product for the cost of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittbrodt | first1 = B.T. | last2 = Glover | first2 = A.G. | last3 = Laureto | first3 = J. | last4 = Anzalone | first4 = G.C. | last5 = Oppliger | first5 = D. | last6 = Irwin | first6 = J.L. | last7 = Pearce | first7 = J.M. | year = 2013 | title = Life-cycle economic analysis of distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printers | url = | journal = Mechatronics | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 713–726 | doi = 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.06.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sharer may receive feedback and potentially improvements on the original design from the [[peer production]] community.

===Licensing alternatives===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Smart phones.jpg|thumb|125px|Google Android operating system]] --&gt;
Alternative arrangements have also been shown to result in good creation outside of the proprietary license model. Examples include:{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

*[[File:Wikipedia-logo-en-big.png|thumb|125px|Wikipedia is an example of a global application of the open source model.]]Creation for its own sake – For example, [[Wikipedia]] editors add content for recreation. Artists have a drive to create. Both communities benefit from free starting material.
* Voluntary after-the-fact donations – used by [[shareware]], [[street performer]]s, and [[public broadcasting]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Patron – For example, [[open access]] publishing relies on institutional and government funding of research faculty, who also have a professional incentive to publish for reputation and career advancement. Works of the U.S. federal government are automatically released into the [[public domain]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* [[Freemium]] – Give away a limited version for free and charge for a premium version (potentially using a [[dual license]]).
* Give away the product and charge something related – Charge for support of open-source [[enterprise software]], give away music but charge for concert admission.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Give away work in order to gain market share – Used by artists, in corporate software to spoil a dominant competitor (for example in the [[browser wars]] and the [[Android operating system]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* For own use – Businesses or individual software developers often create software to solve a problem, bearing the full cost of initial creation. They will then open source the solution, and benefit from the improvements others make for their own needs. Communalizing the maintenance burden distributes the cost across more users; [[free rider problem|free riders]] can also benefit without undermining the creation process.

==Open-source applications==
[[File:121212 2 OpenSwissKnife.png|thumb|Open-source model application domains]]
Social and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source. Advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields. But [[Eric Raymond]] and other founders of the [[open-source movement]] have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software, saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story may be less compelling. The broader impact of the open-source movement, and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures, remain to be seen.

The [[open-source movement]] has inspired increased [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and liberty in [[biotechnology]] research, for example by [http://Therapoid.net/ open therapeutics] and [[CAMBIA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/470.html |title='Open-Source Practices for Biotechnology' — Cambia — Enabling Innovation |publisher=Cambia |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the research methodologies themselves can benefit from the application of open-source principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Joshua M.|title=Open Source Research in Sustainability|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=1 August 2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=238–243|doi=10.1089/sus.2012.9944}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also given rise to the rapidly-expanding [[open-source hardware]] movement.

[[Open-source hardware]] is hardware which initial specification, usually in a software format, is published and made available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify and redistribute the hardware and source code without paying royalties or fees. Open-source hardware evolves through community cooperation. These communities are composed of individual hardware/software developers, hobbyists, as well as very large companies. Examples of open-source hardware initiatives are:
* [[Openmoko]]: a family of open-source [[mobile phone]]s, including the hardware specification and the [[operating system]].
* [[OpenRISC]]: an open-source microprocessor family, with architecture specification licensed under [[GNU GPL]] and implementation under [[LGPL]].

* Open-content projects organized by the Wikimedia Foundation – Sites such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary have embraced the open-content [[Creative Commons]] content licenses. These licenses were designed to adhere to principles similar to various open-source software development licenses. Many of these licenses ensure that content remains free for re-use, that source documents are made readily available to interested parties, and that changes to content are accepted easily back into the system. Important sites embracing open-source-like ideals are [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ |title=Project Gutenberg — free ebooks |publisher=Gutenberg.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wikisource]], both of which post many books on which the copyright has expired and are thus in the [[public domain]], ensuring that anyone has free, unlimited access to that content.

An example of this application is the use of open-source 3D printers like the [[RepRap]] to manufacture appropriate technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.M. Pearce |author2=C.

* [[Open-source learning|Teaching]] – which involves applying the concepts of open source to instruction using a shared web space as a platform to improve upon learning, organizational, and management challenges. An example of an Open-source courseware is the Java Education &amp; Development Initiative (JEDI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kenai.com/projects/jedi |title=JEDI: The Open Source {{not a typo|Curricullum}} — Project Kenai |publisher=Kenai.com |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include [[Khan Academy]] and [[wikiversity]].

* There are few examples of business information (methodologies, advice, guidance, practices) using the open-source model, although this is another case where the potential is enormous. [[ITIL]] is close to open source.

==Society and culture==
{{disputed section|date=December 2016}}
The rise of open-source culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve require access to content that is often [[copyright]]ed, and restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content. The two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright (particularly in the [[United States]]) and penalties, such as those articulated in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), placed on attempts to circumvent anti-piracy technologies.&lt;ref name="copyright1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf |title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 |format=PDF |date = December 1998|author = US Copyright Office |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although artistic appropriation is often permitted under [[fair use|fair-use]] doctrines, the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners. Also, the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a "[[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]]" among cultural practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/ |title=Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |publisher=Chillingeffects.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an "open-source" culture runs parallel to "[[Free Culture movement|Free Culture]]," but is substantively different. ''Free culture'' is a term derived from the [[free software movement]], and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers. Yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought. Instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes, an argument for OSC takes into account diverse goods (as in "the Good life") and ends.

Sites such as [[ccMixter]] offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a [[Creative Commons]] license. The resulting cultural product is then available to download free (generally accessible) to anyone with an Internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Open source software development – Just another case of collective invention?|url=http://ccmixter.org/about|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fccmixter.org%2Fabout&amp;date=2011-12-22|archivedate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older analog technologies such as the [[telephone]] or [[television]] have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have.

Through various technologies such as [[peer-to-peer]] networks and [[blogs]], cultural producers can take advantage of vast [[social networks]] to distribute their products. As opposed to traditional media distribution, redistributing digital media on the Internet can be virtually costless. Technologies such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[Gnutella]] take advantage of various characteristics of the Internet protocol ([[TCP/IP]]) in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution.

{{further|Open-source software movement}}

===Government===
* [[Open politics]] (sometimes known as ''Open-source politics'') is a political process that uses Internet technologies such as blogs, email and polling to provide for a rapid feedback mechanism between political organizations and their supporters. There is also an alternative conception of the term ''Open-source politics'' which relates to the development of public policy under a set of rules and processes similar to the open-source software movement.
* [[Open-source governance]] is similar to open-source politics, but it applies more to the democratic process and promotes the freedom of information.
* The [[South Korean government]] wants to increase its use of free and open-source software, in order to decrease its dependence on proprietary software solutions. It plans to make open standards a requirement, to allow the government to choose between multiple operating systems and web browsers. Korea's Ministry of Science, ICT &amp; Future Planning is also preparing ten pilots on using open-source software distributions.&lt;ref&gt;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/south-korean-government-switch-open-source&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Open-source ethics is split into two strands:
* Open-source ethics as an ethical school – Charles Ess and David Berry are researching whether ethics can learn anything from an open-source approach. Ess famously even defined the [[Association of Internet Researchers|AoIR]] Research Guidelines as an example of open-source ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flosshub.org/sites/flosshub.org/files/berry2.pdf Berry (2004) Internet Ethics: Privacy, Ethics and Alienation{{spaced ndash}}An Open Source Approach.] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open-source ethics as a professional body of rules – This is based principally on the computer ethics school, studying the questions of ethics and professionalism in the computer industry in general and software development in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=El-Emam, K |title=Ethics and Open Source |journal=Empirical Software Engineering |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=2001 |url=http://springerlink.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=hf0bld3qlk0unn8f8x2m&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,2,12;journal,14,33;linkingpublicationresults,1:100262,1#ContactOfAuthor1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Irish philosopher Richard Kearney has used the term "open-source Hinduism" to refer to the way historical figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda worked upon this ancient tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Kearney |title=Anatheism: Returning to God After God |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRiTJ_6JFYYC&amp;pg=PR13 |year=2011 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-14789-7 |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
[[Open-source journalism]] formerly referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking, reflecting ''[[open-source intelligence]]'', a similar term used in military intelligence circles. Now, ''open-source journalism'' commonly refers to forms of innovative publishing of [[online journalism]], rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist. In the 25 December 2006 issue of TIME magazine this is referred to as [[user generated content|user created content]] and listed alongside more traditional open-source projects such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Linux]].

[[Blog|Weblogs]], or blogs, are another significant platform for open-source culture. Blogs consist of periodic, reverse chronologically ordered posts, using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design, code, or [[file transfer]] required. While corporations, political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information, many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression, political organizing, and socializing. Some, such as [[LiveJournal]] or [[WordPress]], utilize open-source software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes. Whether the code is open or not, this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and re-present culture; whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate, the mutability of blogs makes "open sourcing" even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere.

[[Messageboards]] are another platform for open-source culture. Messageboards (also known as discussion boards or forums), are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to. Messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are [[spamming|spammers]]. Other common board features are private messages (where users can send messages to one another) as well as chat (a way to have a real time conversation online) and image uploading. Some messageboards use [[phpBB]], which is a free open-source package. Where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors, messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly. Messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life—for instance, instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising, one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product, movie or CD. By removing the cultural middlemen, messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas.

[[OpenDocument]] is an [[open format|open]] [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), [[spreadsheet]]s, charts, and presentations. Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as OpenDocument avoid being [[Vendor lock-in|locked into]] a single software vendor, leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business, raises their prices, changes their software, or changes their [[software license|licensing]] terms to something less favorable.

[[Open-source film|Open-source movie production]] is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production, a system in which the end result is made available for re-use by others or in which exclusively open-source products are used in the production. The 2006 movie [[Elephants Dream]] is said to be the "world's first open movie",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantsdream.org/ |title=Elephants Dream |publisher=Elephants Dream |date=2006-08-13 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; created entirely using [[open-source technology]].

An open-source documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material [[footage]], and other filmic elements, both in unedited and edited form, similar to crowdsourcing. By doing so, on-line contributors become part of the process of creating the film, helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary, as well as its thematic development. The first open-source documentary film is the non-profit "[[The American Revolution]]", which went into development in 2006, and will examine the role media played in the cultural, social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station WBCN-FM in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;"Web Power to the People," The Boston Herald, 29 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Glory Days of the Rock of Boston," Boston Globe, Op-Ed, 18 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'BCN Documentary Looks for Archival Contributors," Boston Herald, 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"WBCN and The American Revolution," The Huffington Post, 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the non-profit Filmmakers Collaborative. Open Source Cinema is a website to create Basement Tapes, a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age, co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca |title=Watch Documentaries and Animated Films Online |publisher=NFB.ca |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Open-source film|Open-source film-making]] refers to a form of film-making that takes a method of idea formation from open-source software, but in this case the 'source' for a filmmaker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code. It can also refer to a method of film-making where the process of creation is 'open' i.e. a disparate group of contributors, at different times contribute to the final piece.

[[Open-IPTV]] is [[IPTV]] that is not limited to one recording studio, production studio, or cast. Open-IPTV uses the Internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show.

===Education===
[[File:Global Open Educational Resources Logo.svg|thumb|125px|[[Open Educational Resources]] logo]]
Within the academic community, there is discussion about expanding what could be called the "intellectual commons" (analogous to the [[Creative Commons]]). Proponents of this view have hailed the [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]] Project at [[Rice University]], [[MIT OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare]] project at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Eugene Thacker]]'s article on "open-source DNA", the "Open Source Cultural Database", [[Salman Khan (educator)|Salman Khan]]'s [[Khan Academy]] and [[Wikipedia]] as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software.

[[Open-source curriculum|Open-source curricula]] are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used, distributed and modified.

Another strand to the academic community is in the area of research. Many funded research projects produce software as part of their work. There is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an open-source license. In the UK the [[Jisc|Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)]] has developed a policy on open-source software. JISC also funds a development service called [[OSS Watch]] which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use, contribute to and develop open-source software.

On 30 March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which included $2 billion over four years to fund the [[TAACCCT|TAACCCT program]], which is described as "the largest OER (open education resources) initiative in the world and uniquely focused on creating curricula in partnership with industry for credentials in vocational industry sectors like manufacturing, health, energy, transportation, and IT".&lt;ref&gt;http://openeducation2013.sched.org/event/23553161b01967fd7ff58eea22ce24b2#.U_qxw2Mpft8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation communities===
The principle of sharing pre-dates the open-source movement; for example, the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century. Open-source principles have always been part of the scientific community. The sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] described the four basic elements of the community—universal ism (an international perspective), communal ism (sharing information), disinterestedness (removing one's personal views from the scientific inquiry) and organized skepticism (requirements of proof and review) that accurately describe the scientific community today.

These principles are, in part, complemented by US law's focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves. There is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary. One of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been [[Open access (publishing)|open access]]—the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public. There are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online, however most journals do charge a fee (either to users or libraries for access). The [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the Internet.

The [[National Institutes of Health]] has recently proposed a policy on "Enhanced Public Access to NIH Research Information". This policy would provide a free, searchable resource of NIH-funded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication. The NIH's move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research. Many of the questions have yet to be answered—the balancing of profit vs. public access, and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access.

Farmavita.Net is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of open-source pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmavita.net/content/view/336/84/ |title=Pharmaceutical Licensing Network — Open Source Pharmaceuticals — New Business Model |publisher=Farmavita.Net |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is targeted to development and sharing of know-how for manufacture of essential and life-saving medicines. It is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs. It will be limited to generic (off-patent) medicines with established use. By definition, a medicinal product has a "well-established use" if is used for at least 15 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In that event, the expensive clinical test and trial results could be replaced by appropriate scientific literature.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] was an early contributor eventually donating all his inventions including the [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals]], and the [[lightning rod]] to the public domain.

New NGO communities are starting to use the open-source technology as a tool. One example is the Open Source Youth Network started in 2007 in Lisboa by ISCA members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319051530/http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork|date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Open innovation]] is also a new emerging concept which advocate putting R&amp;D in a common pool. The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] platform is openly presenting itself as an Open innovation network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/membersminutes/20070920MembersMeeting/07.09.12-Eclipse-Open-Innovation.pdf |title=Eclipse|publisher=Eclipse.org|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and recreation===
Copyright protection is used in the performing arts and even in athletic activities. Some groups have attempted to remove copyright from such practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogaunity.org |title=Open Source Yoga Unity — Home |publisher=Yogaunity.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Russian music composer, scientist and [[Russian Pirate Party]] member Victor Argonov presented detailed raw files of his electronic opera "2032"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argonov.ru/2032.html |title=Техно-опера "2032: Легенда о несбывшемся грядущем" |publisher=Argonov.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; under free license [[Creative Commons license|CC-BY-NC 3.0]]. This opera was originally composed and published in 2007 by Russian label [[MC Entertainment]] as a commercial product, but then the author changed its status to free. In his blog [http://argonov.livejournal.com] he said that he decided to open raw files (including wav, midi and other used formats) to the public in order to support worldwide pirate actions against [[SOPA]] and [[Personal Information Protection Act|PIPA]]. Several Internet resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muznews.rockzvuk.com/news/pervaja_v_mire_muzykalnaja_opera_s_otkrytymi_iskhodnikami/2012-01-25-202 |title=Первая в мире музыкальная опера с открытыми исходниками — 25 Января 2012 — Новости музыки и шоубизнеса |publisher=Muznews.rockzvuk.com |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/talks/7294092 |title=Музыкальная опера "2032" становится opensource — Talks — Форум|publisher=Linux.org.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netskop.ru/kulmztura/news_2012-01-19-16-40-02-974.html |title=Первая в мире музыкальная опера с открытыми исходниками |publisher=Netskop.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; called "2032" the first open-source musical opera in history.

The following are events and applications that have been developed via the open source community, and echo the ideologies of the open source movement.&lt;ref name="ref_e_TnL"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ757139&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ757139|title=The case for open source: Open source has made significant leaps in recent years. what does it have to offer education?|year=2007|journal= Technology &amp; Learning|volume= 27|issue=7|page= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[OpenCourseWare|Open Education Consortium]]'''&amp;nbsp;— an organization composed of various colleges that support open source and share some of their material online. This organization, headed by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], was established to aid in the exchange of open source educational materials.

'''Synthetic Biology'''- This new technology is potentially important because it promises to enable cheap, lifesaving new drugs as well as helping to yield biofuels that may help to solve our energy problem. Although synthetic biology has not yet come out of its "lab" stage, it has potential to become industrialized in the near future. In order to industrialize open source science, there are some scientists who are trying to build their own brand of it.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Center. (2009).

Wislson On Demand Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ideologically-related movements ===
The [[open access|open-access movement]] is a movement that is similar in ideology to the open source movement. Members of this movement maintain that academic material should be readily available to provide help with “future research, assist in teaching and aid in academic purposes.” The Open access movement aims to eliminate subscription fees and licensing restrictions of academic materials&lt;ref name="ref_a4"&gt;Harnad, S.

The [[free-culture movement]] is a movement that seeks to achieve a culture that engages in collective freedom via freedom of expression, free public access to knowledge and information, full demonstration of creativity and innovation in various arenas and promotion of citizen liberties.&lt;ref name="FreeCulture"&gt;Students For Free Culture. (2009). [http://freeculture.org/ Main Page]. Retrieved 22 November 2009, from free culture.org&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Creative Commons]] is an organization that “develops, supports, and stewards legal and technical infrastructure that maximizes digital creativity, sharing, and innovation.” It encourages the use of protected properties online for research, education, and creative purposes in pursuit of a universal access.  Creative Commons provides an infrastructure through a set of copyright licenses and tools that creates a better balance within the realm of “all rights reserved” properties.&lt;ref name="Creative Commons"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/|title=Creative Commons Organization|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Creative Commons license offers a slightly more lenient alternative to “all rights reserved” copyrights for those who do not wish to exclude the use of their material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to find Creative Commons images on Flickr|url=http://www.newmediarights.org/open_source/licensing/creative_commons/how_find_creative_commons_images_flickr|website=New Media Rights|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Zeitgeist Movement]] is an international social movement that advocates a transition into a [[sustainability|sustainable]] "resource-based economy" based on [[collaboration]] in which monetary incentives are replaced by commons-based ones with everyone [[sharing economy|having access]] to everything (from code to products) as in "open source everything".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dostaler|first1=Kim|title=The Zeitgeist Movement: Getting to the Root of the Problem|url=http://truththeory.com/2012/07/19/the-zeitgeist-movement-getting-to-the-root-of-the-problem/|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dobson|first1=Stuart|title=Forget the Class War, How to Win the Fight Against the Elite|url=http://blog.thezeitgeistmovement.com/blog/stuart-dobson/forget-class-war-how-win-fight-against-elite|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=27 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611154722/http://blog.thezeitgeistmovement.com/blog/stuart-dobson/forget-class-war-how-win-fight-against-elite|archivedate=11 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While its activism and events are typically focused on media and education, TZM is a major supporter of open source projects worldwide since they allow for uninhibited advancement of science and technology, independent of constraints posed by institutions of patenting and capitalist investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Source Ecology - Zeitgeist movement|url=http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Zeitgeist_movement|publisher=[[Open Source Ecology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[P2P Foundation]] is an “international organization focused on studying, researching, documenting and promoting [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer to peer practices]] in a very broad sense”. Its objectives incorporate those of the open source movement, whose principles are integrated in a larger socio-economic model.&lt;ref name="P2P Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://p2pfoundation.net/P2P_Foundation:About/|title=P2P Foundation:About|publisher=P2P Foundation|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paying public domain''' ({{lang-fr|Domaine public payant}}, {{lang-es|dominio público pagante}}) is a [[copyright]] regime where copies, presentations or performances of a work that has entered the [[public domain]] are still subject to royalties, which are payable to the state or to an authors' association.
The principle is that revenue from the work of long-dead artists should be used to support creativity of living artists.
It may apply only to certain types of work, such as folklore or traditional cultural expressions.
However, communities that wish to control their traditional knowledge or cultural expressions may perceive the royalties as an unwelcome tax.
Paying public domain regimes have been introduced and withdrawn in several countries. 
They are still in place in several countries in South America and Africa.

==Origins==

[[Victor Hugo]], who also played an important role in developing the [[Berne Convention]], was one of the earlier supporters of the concept of ''domaine public payant'', under which a nominal fee would be charged for copying or performing works in the public domain, and this would go into a common fund dedicated to helping artists, especially young people.
At this time, copyright in France was weak. 
There was no post-mortem protection of works, but only a period of exploitation that started from the date of publication and could expire during the author's lifetime.{{sfn|Jomunsi|2018}}

==Definition==

A 1949 UNESCO report said that the normal sense of the term was that "after the expiration of the normal period of protection, that is, when the work falls into the public domain, the work cannot be freely used, as it could in the case of normal free public domain. Instead, the user must pay a royalty, generally to the authors' societies, who utilize such funds for cultural purposes or to aid needy authors or their families. In some cases, the state also participates in such fees."{{sfn|UNESCO|1949|p=1}}
A 2010 WIPO report said that under these regimes "a fee is imposed for the use of works in the public domain. Generally, the system works like a compulsory license: the use is conditioned on payment of the prescribed fee but not upon the securing of a prior authorization."{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=2}}

Fees payable to the state and/or the authors' society vary from country to country.{{sfn|UNESCO|1949|p=2}}
The user must pay the fee, but does not have to obtain prior authorization.
The fee may only be applicable to commercial exploitation of the material.
It usually applies only to works that have entered the public domain because their copyright has expired, but in some countries it applies to expressions of folklore.{{sfn|WIPO Secretariat|2010|p=11}}
Usually the fees are used to fund young or struggling creators, or to promote creative works, but in Algeria they are used to preserve the public domain itself.
The cost of administration may absorb much of the money, but if the fees are to high they may discourage use of public domain materials.{{sfn|WIPO Secretariat|2010|p=12}}

The concept has been proposed as a way to protect traditional cultural expressions, but may not be suitable for communities more interested in control over traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions than in compensation.{{sfn|WIPO Secretariat|2010|p=12}}
It might be difficult to establish the true owners and the types of work to which it would apply, and it could be seen simply as a form of taxation.{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=4}}

==Countries==
The 1949 UNESCO report said there were only five countries that had laws that adopted this system: Uruguay (since 1937), Bulgaria (since 1939), Italy (since 1941), Rumania [sic] (since 1946) and Yugoslavia (since 1946).
The report thought that some form of ''domaine public payant'' might also apply in Russia.
In Bulgaria, Uruguay and Yugoslavia, the rule applied to any sort of public domain work.
In Italy it was limited to presentation of works intended for public showing and musical works, and to books.
In Rumania it applied to publication and representation of literary and dramatic works.
In Bulgaria the duration lasted for 20 years after the work entered the public domain, but in the other countries it was perpetual.{{sfn|UNESCO|1949|p=1}}

In the past Brazil (1973–83), Italy (1882–1925 and 1941–96), France (1956–76) and Mexico (1963–93) had paying public domain regimes, but have since abolished them.{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=5}}
A 1984 article listed Argentina, Italy, Mexico and the USSR among the countries that had adopted some form of the system.{{sfn|Mouchet|1983–1984|p=137}}
A 2017 article noted that in Argentina and Uruguay a fee was payable to the state for almost every use of works in the public domain, whether or not for commercial purposes, including reproduction, publication, performance and broadcasting.{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=1}}

The 2010 WIPO report noted the paying public domain was still in force in Algeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire and Paraguay. 
It explained that the Bangui Agreement of the OAPI ([[Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle]]) and its Annex on literary and artistic property provided for such a regime for exploitation of expressions of folklore and works or productions that have fallen into the public domain.{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=3}}
A similar system, called "Community Intellectual Rights", has been proposed in Latin America, inspired in part by Peru's Law No. 27811.
The concept is that "traditional knowledge should stay in the public domain for anyone to use, but originators should share in the benefits when it is used for commercial purposes. Furthermore, these rights should not be subject to time limits.{{sfn|Busch|2015|p=267}}

There have been proposals to introduce a ''domaine public payant'' system across Europe, but as of 2001 the idea had not gained much support.{{harv|Stokes|2001|p=63}}
The German Writers Union has proposed a modern version on the grounds that ''droit de suite'' and ''domaine public payant'' should be linked, since ''droit de suite'' usually benefits the distant heirs of dead artists rather than being used to encourage living artists.
A proposal discussed and rejected for the 1993 Term Directive was that the last 20 years of ''post mortem auctoris'' fees should be used to benefit living artists rather than the artist's heirs.{{sfn|Stokes|2001|p=64}}

==Sample laws==
Under Algeria's 19 July 2003 Copyrights and Related Rights Act, works of  traditional cultural heritage and national works considered as public
property are granted special protection [Article 8].
The National Bureau of Copyrights and Neighboring Rights protects these works [Article 139].
Their use is subject to a license from the Bureau, and if the use is profitable a royalty is payable to the Bureau [Article 140].{{sfn|Algeria|2003}}

Burundi Act 1/021 2005 Article 25 says:
*Works in the public domain shall be placed under the protection of the State, represented by the Ministry in charge of culture.
*The public representation or performance or the direct or indirect fixation of works in the public domain and of works exclusively composed of elements borrowed from works that have fallen into the public domain, with a view to exploitation for profit, are subject to regulations on royalties under conditions that shall be determined by an order of the Ministry in charge of culture.  
*The revenue from the collection of royalties for the use of works in the public domain shall be devoted to social and cultural purposes.{{sfn|Act No. 1/021 of December 30, 2005 ... Burundi|loc=Art 25}}

Cape Verde ''Decree-Law No. 1/2009'' of April 27, 2009 says "The use and exploitation, for financial gain, of works in the public domain shall be free as long as such use is subordinate to absolute respect for the moral rights, on the previous authorization of the member of Government responsible for culture and the payment of a fee to be set by the members of Government responsible for culture and finance, with the purpose of promotion and cultural development and social assistance to Cape Verdean authors."{{sfn|Cape Verde|2009|loc=Article.34(4)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1903">'''Qualimetry''' is a scientific discipline which concerns itself with the methods and problems of quantification of the quality of any object: things or processes, whether natural or man-made, products of labour or nature, whether living or inanimate,  etc.&lt;ref&gt;Azgaldov, G. G. (1982), Theory and Practice of Product  Quality Assessment: Fundamentals of Qualimetry, Ekonomika,  Moscow (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a scientific theory of the quantitative determination of quality developed in the former USSR by G.G.Azgaldov&lt;ref&gt;Azgaldov, G.G. (1981), "Development of the theoretical basis of qualimetry", doctoral dissertation, Kuibyshev Military Engineering Academy, Moscow (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; and currently used in development of Russian standards&lt;ref&gt;Product Quality (1979), Product Quality: Terms and Definitions. -  GOST 15467 – 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[GOST]]),  etc.

==Discussion==
"The term qualimetry (from the Latin [[quale]], “of what kind”), which designates a scientific discipline studying the methodology and problems of quantitative assessment of the quality of any kind of object (primarily, products), was first used in 1968.  That this initiative was timely and justifiable was borne out by a series of international scholarly conferences fully or partly devoted to issues of qualimetry, e.g., in [[Moscow]], [[Oslo]], [[Varna]], [[Yerevan]], [[Madrid]] or [[Tallinn]]. 
The term qualimetry is being gradually admitted into the scientific and engineering vocabularies of many countries. According to Google, tens of thousands of references to publications in 32 languages contain this term. " &lt;ref&gt;Azgaldov, G.G. and Kostin, A.V. (2011), "Applied Qualimetry: its Origins, Errors and Misconceptions", Benchmarking: An International Journal, Vol. 18 Iss: 3, pp.428 – 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silicon Fen''' (sometimes known as the '''Cambridge Cluster''') is the name given to the region around [[Cambridge]], [[England]], which is home to a large [[business cluster|cluster]] of [[high-tech]] [[businesses]] focusing on [[software]], [[electronics]] and [[biotechnology]].  Many of these businesses have connections with the [[University of Cambridge]], and the area is now one of the most important technology centres in [[Europe]].

It is called "Silicon Fen" by analogy with [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]], because it lies at the southern tip of the [[The Fens|English Fenland]]. The interest in technology in the area started with [[Acorn Computers]].&lt;ref name="zdnet cambridge"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/it-strategy/1998/12/01/us-report-old-cambridge-targets-high-tech-success-2070082/ | title=US Report: Old Cambridge targets high-tech success | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=1 December 1998 | accessdate=15 December 2011 | author=Jones, Kevin | quote=The focus on technology in the so-called Silicon Fen started two decades ago with Acorn Computer PLC, which became the U.K.'s leading personal computer maker until the advent of Windows.

==Business growth==
More than 1000 high-technology companies established offices in the area during the five years preceding 1998.&lt;ref name="nytimes Ibrahim 1998"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/010498cambridge.html | title=In Old England a Silicon Fen: Cambridge as a High-Tech Outpost | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=4 January 1998 | accessdate=13 June 2012 | author=Ibrahim, Youseff M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early successful businesses were [[Advanced RISC Machines]] and [[Cambridge Display Technology]].&lt;ref name="zdnet cambridge" /&gt; In 2004, 24% of all UK [[venture capital]] (8% of all the EU's) was received by Silicon Fen companies, according to the Cambridge Cluster Report 2004 produced by [[Library House]] and [[Grant Thornton]].

The so-called ''Cambridge phenomenon'', giving rise to start-up companies in a town previously only having a little light industry in the [[electrical engineering|electrical sector]], is usually dated to the founding of the [[Cambridge Science Park]] in 1970: this was an initiative of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College, Cambridge University]] and moved away from a traditional low-development policy for Cambridge.

The characteristic of Cambridge is small companies (as few as three people, in some cases) in sectors such as [[computer-aided design]]. Over time the number of companies has grown; it has not proved easy to count them, but recent estimates have placed the number anywhere between 1,000 and 3,500 companies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} They are spread over an area defined perhaps by the CB [[postcode]] or 01223 [[telephone]] [[area code]], or more generously in an area bounded by [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], [[Saffron Walden]], [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] and [[Huntingdon]].

In 2000, then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] set up a research partnership between [[MIT]] and Cambridge University, the [[Cambridge–MIT Institute]], in order to increase international collaboration between the two universities and to strengthen the economic success of Silicon Fen.

In February 2006, the [[Judge Business School|Judge Business School, Cambridge University]] reported estimates that suggested that at that time, there were around 250 active start-ups directly linked to the University, valued at around US$6 billion.  Only a tiny proportion of these companies have so far grown into [[multinational corporation|multinational]]s: [[ARM Ltd|ARM]], [[Autonomy Corporation]] and [[AVEVA]] are the most obvious examples, and more recently [[Cambridge Silicon Radio|CSR]] has seen rapid growth due to the uptake of [[Bluetooth]].

It was found in 2012 that strong employment growth was hampered due to the concentration on [[research and development]]. This was because of limited competition in manufacturing capability and its consequent cost.&lt;ref name="hbs andersen 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Andersen|first=Christian|author2=Bailey, Jonathan|author3=Heal, Adam|author4=Munn, Oliver|author5=O'Connell, Bryan|title=IT Hardware cluster: Cambridge, United Kingdom|url=http://www.isc.hbs.edu/pdf/Student_Projects/2012%20MOC%20Papers/20120504%20MOC%20UK%20Cambridge%20IT%20hardware%20cluster%20-%20Final%20project%20paper.pdf|work=Final Paper; Microeconomics of Competitiveness, Harvard Business School|publisher=[[Harvard Business School]]|accessdate=18 June 2012|date=4 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619111115/http://www.isc.hbs.edu/pdf/Student_Projects/2012%20MOC%20Papers/20120504%20MOC%20UK%20Cambridge%20IT%20hardware%20cluster%20-%20Final%20project%20paper.pdf|archivedate=19 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work by [http://www.cambridgeahead.co.uk Cambridge Ahead], the business and academic membership organisation dedicated to the successful growth of the city region in the long-term, has shown that in 2015-16, growth of Cambridge companies continued at around 7% on a one, three and five-year view. Global turnover of Cambridge companies increased by 7.6% to £35.7bn, up from £33bn the previous year, and global employment grew by 7.6% to 210,292. The number of companies with their home base within 20 miles of Cambridge has grown from 22,017 to 24,580.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeahead.co.uk/2017/01/latest-data-cambridge-ahead-reveals-unabated-growth-cambridge-companies/|title=Latest data from Cambridge Ahead reveals unabated growth of Cambridge companies|last=|first=|date=2017-01-24|website=www.cambridgeahead.co.uk|publisher=Cambridge Ahead|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is striking about the data is that 2015-16 was just another typical 7% growth year for Cambridge. Over the past five years (2010-11 to 2015-16) the turnover of Cambridge companies has grown by 7.5% per annum, and employment by 6.6% per annum.

The growth of Silicon Fen is best revealed by the [http://www.camclustermap.com Cambridge Cluster Map], a new data tool that accurately maps the growth of the Cambridge sub-region over time and reveals the true extent of the success of the ‘Cambridge Phenomenon’. The map was created and launched in July 2016 by Cambridge Ahead in partnership with Barclays, working with the Centre for Business Research (CBR) at the University of Cambridge, and is an updated version of the previous Cluster Map covering the Tech sector launched in 2012.

The new dataset identifies and locates companies and certain research facilities that are active within a 20-mile radius of the centre of the city and shows three types of organisations: Cambridge-based companies, Cambridge-active companies, and Non-corporate Knowledge-intensive (KI) organisations.

==Area characteristics==
The region has one of the most flexible job markets in the technology sector, and people are often employed by other companies after a start-up fails. Although everyone wants their company to succeed, failures are tolerated, indeed almost expected.

One reason for the area's success is that after some time such an employment market is self-sustaining, since employees are willing to move to an area that promises a future beyond any one company. Another factor is the high degree of 'networking', enabling people across the region to find partners, jobs, funding, and know-how. Organisations have sprung up to facilitate this process, for example the [[Cambridge Network]].

Another factor is the academic pre-eminence of [[Cambridge University]], which is one of the top 5 universities in the world, a high [[standard of living]] available in the county, and good transport links, for example to London and with [[Cambridge Airport]]  having a full service business jet centre.  Many graduates from the university choose to stay on in the area, giving local companies a rich pool of talent to draw upon {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. The high-technology industry has little by way of competition, unlike say in [[Oxfordshire]] where many other competing industries exist. Because Cambridgeshire was not until recently a high-technology centre, commercial rents were generally lower than in other parts of the UK, giving companies a head-start on those situated in other more expensive regions; this has, however, recently changed and Cambridgeshire now has one of the highest costs of living in the UK outside London.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

[[File:Silvio Denz Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Silvio Werner Denz]]

'''Silvio Werner Denz''' (born 14 September 1956 in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]) is a Swiss entrepreneur and collector of wine and art, currently living in Switzerland. He worked for various companies in Switzerland and the United States in finance, retail and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Valli Marie-Pierre. [http://www.lemonde.fr/journalelectronique/donnees/libre/20140411/index.html?cahier=LIV  "Silvio Denz épouse son temps"], ''[[Le Monde]]'', Paris, 2014-04-11 2014. Retrieved 2014-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt; He now operates mainly in the fields of luxury goods and wine. The Swiss business magazine ''Bilanz'' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bilanz.ch/people/300-reichste&lt;/ref&gt; ranks him among the 300 wealthiest Swiss citizens and, more recently, among the 100 most important figures of the Swiss economy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bilanz.ch/people/luxus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneur==

===Perfume, cosmetics===
In 1980 Silvio Denz took over the management of [[Zurich]]-based Alrodo AG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kolesnikov-Jessop Sonia |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/business/international/covering-the-skill-basics-at-big-companies.html?_r=0 |title=Covering the Skill Basics at Big Companies |publisher=International New York Times |date=2014-09-01 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time was owned by his father and uncle. Initially with eight employees, the company purchased perfumes and cosmetics for imported perfumery retailers. After acquiring all the equity in Alrodo in 1984, he built up the company over the next 20 years to become Switzerland's largest perfumery chain, with 120 branches. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of employees rose from 8 to 800. In 2000 Denz sold Alrodo to the French perfumery chain Marionnaud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carole Bellemare |url= http://www.lefigaro.fr/decideurs/nomination/2015/10/21/33002-20151021ARTFIG00429-silvio-denz-l-esthete-et-epicurienqui-redonne-du-lustre-a-lalique.php |title=Silvio Denz, l'esthète et épicurienqui redonne du lustre à Lalique |publisher=Le Figaro |date=2015-10-21 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he founded Lalique Group (formerly known as Art &amp; Fragrance) specializing in the creation, production and marketing of perfume and cosmetic brands such as Perfumes [[Alain Delon]], [[Parfums Grès]], Perfumes Lalique, Jaguar Fragrances, Bentley Fragrances and Ultrasun.&lt;ref&gt;Bilanz 31 May 2005; "Silvio Denz: Rastloser Schlossherr"; by Corinne Amacher&lt;/ref&gt; The company has been listed on the stock exchange since 2007. It was first listed on the BX Berne eXchange and since June 2018 the Group has been listed on SIX Swiss Exchange.
===Luxury===
Silvio Denz accumulated the world's largest private collection of vintage perfume bottles designed by [[René Lalique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samantha Brooks |url= http://robbreport.com/Art-Collectibles/Crystal-Revelations |title= Crystal revelations |publisher=Robb Report |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sonia Kolesnikov-Jessop |url= http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/998924/the-collector-silvio-denz-and-his-lalique-glass-menagerie |title= The Collector: Silvio Denz and his Lalique Glass Menagerie |publisher=Blouinartinfo.com |date=2014-01-03 |accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising over 650 original pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Watch Your Time, supplément Montres du Monde, page 15, 11 April 2014, Marie-Pierre Valli&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the company acquired the French crystalware house Lalique S.A. The group became profitable again after being restructured, with branding focused on art, decorative items, interior design, jewellery, perfume and hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;Le Point, 1st January 2015, Marine de la Horie, „L’art et la matière“&lt;/ref&gt; Co-branding projects were developed between Lalique and various other luxury brands (including [[Bentley]], [[The Macallan]] and [[Steinway &amp; Sons]]). Collaborations were also signed with artists such as [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Damien Hirst]], and [[Elton John]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Adams |url= http://issuu.com/runwildmedia/docs/mayf_nov_15 |title= The Butterfly Effect |publisher=The Mayfair Magazine |date=2015-11-01 |accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in collections for the company, in some cases. In 2011, the Lalique museum in Wingen-sur-Moder ([[Alsace]]) opened to display more than 650 pieces designed by [[René Lalique]] and his successors, including jewellery, crystal and decorative glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eve M.

===Wine===
In 1994 Silvio Denz, along with Franz Wermuth and five other partners, founded Les Grand Vins Wermuth S.A., now split into Denz Weine (distribution) and Wermuth Auktionen AG (auctions)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wermuth.ch |title=Les Grands Vins Wermuth SA, Weinhandel, Weinauktionen |publisher=Wermuth.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Zurich. In 1998, acting with the same partners, he bought the Clos d'Agon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closdagon.com |title=Clos d'Agon |publisher=Closdagon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; estate on the [[Costa Brava]], which is overseen by the oenologist [[Peter Sisseck]] ([[Dominio Pingus]]).

In 2005, on the recommendation of his friend Count Stephan von Neipperg ([[Château Canon-la-Gaffelière]] and [[La Mondotte]]), Denz bought the Château Faugères estate, six kilometers east of [[Saint Emilion]]. Faugères, which has 30 employees,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.châteaufaugeres.com{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises three vineyards: Château Faugères, Château Péby Faugères, both lying in the Saint-Emilion appellation, and Château Cap-de-Faugères in Côtes de Castillion. In 2010, he and Peter Sisseck took over the vineyard of Château Rocheyron in Saint-Emilion. The estates in [[Bordeaux]] cover a total of 120 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizerische Weinzeitung; Ausgabe 3 März 2012;"Silvio Denz: Unternehmer und leidenschaftlicher Sammler von Weingütern"&lt;/ref&gt; Silvio Denz also owns the Montepeloso winery in Italy (which he acquired with Fabio Chiarelotto in 2007).

The '''South Street Seaport''' is a historic area in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]], centered where [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton Street]] meets the [[East River]], and adjacent to the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]]. The Seaport is a [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan below 14th Street#Historic Districts|designated historic district]], and is distinct from the neighboring Financial District. It is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 1]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], and is bounded by the Financial District to the west, southwest, and north; the East River to the southeast; and [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]] to the northeast.

It features some of the oldest architecture in downtown Manhattan, and includes the largest concentration of restored early 19th-century commercial buildings in the city. This includes renovated original mercantile buildings, renovated sailing ships, the former [[Fulton Fish Market]], and modern tourist malls featuring food, shopping, and nightlife.

==History==

===As port===
The first pier in the area appeared in 1625, when the [[Dutch West India Company]] founded an outpost here.&lt;ref name="report "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/SOUTH_STREET_SEAPORT_HISTORIC_DISTRICT.pdf |title=South Street Seaport Historic District DesignationReport |publisher=nyc.gov |date=1977 |accessdate=May 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gk10Ndoa?url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/SOUTH_STREET_SEAPORT_HISTORIC_DISTRICT.pdf |archivedate=May 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the influx of the first settlers, the area was quickly developed. One of the first and busiest streets in the area was today's  [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]], so named for a variety of coastal pearl shells.&lt;ref name=encnyc&gt;{{cite encnyc}}, pp. 1214–1215&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its location, Pearl Street quickly gained popularity among traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Linda S. Cordell |title=Archaeology in America: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arfWRW5OFVgC |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2008 |page=123 |isbn=0313021899|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/nyregion/south-street-seaport-has-begun-storm-recovery.html?_r=0 |title=Water and Land, Past and Present |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author=Sarah Harrison Smith |date=January 11, 2013 |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gk10weBW?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/nyregion/south-street-seaport-has-begun-storm-recovery.html?_r=1&amp; |archivedate=May 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The East River was eventually narrowed. By the second half of the 17th century, the pier was extended to Water Street, then to [[Lower Manhattan|Front Street]], and by the beginning of the 19th century, to  [[South Street (Manhattan)|South Street]].&lt;ref name = "report" /&gt; The pier was well reputed, as it was protected from westerly winds and ice of the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name=encnyc/&gt;

In 1728, the [[Schermerhorn|Schermerhorn Family]] established trade with the city of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Subsequently, [[rice]] and  [[Indigofera tinctoria|indigo]] came from Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;Kroessler 2002, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the port was also the focal point of delivery of goods from [[England]]. In 1776, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British occupied the port, adversely affecting port trade for eight years. In 1783, many traders returned to England, and most port enterprises collapsed.&lt;ref name = "report" /&gt; The port quickly recovered from the post-war crisis. From 1797 until the middle of 19th century, New York had the country's largest system of maritime trade.&lt;ref name = "report" /&gt; From 1815 to 1860 the port was called the Port of New York.

On February 22, 1784, the ''[[Empress of China (1783)|Empress of China]]'' sailed from the port to [[Guangzhou]] and returned to [[Philadelphia]] on May 15, 1785,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Berube |first1=Claude G. |last2=Rodgaard |first2=John A. |title=A Call To The Sea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6F90OzIaMEC |publisher=Potomac Books |date=2005 |page=7 |isbn=1612342299}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing along, in its cargo,  [[green tea|green]] and [[black tea]]s, [[porcelain]], and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jyh-Ming Yang |title=Lost in Transliteration: The Tolerance of Unintelligibility in Chinese Bibliographic Records in Western Libraries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAktDoGM_iMC |work=The University of Wisconsin -Madison |publisher=ProQuest |year=2008 |page=61 |isbn=0549801332}}&lt;/ref&gt; This operation marked the beginning of trade relations between the newly formed United States and the [[Qing Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Kroessler 2002, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 1818, the 424-ton transatlantic packet ''[[Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet)|James Monroe]]'' sailed from [[Liverpool]], opening the first regular trans-Atlantic voyage route, the Black Ball Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Patrick Bunyan |title=All Around the Town: Amazing Manhattan Facts and Curiosities, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytpzn0EfA-YC |edition=2 |publisher=Fordham Univ Press |year=2010 |series=Empire State Editions Series |pages=52–53 |isbn=0823231747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipping on this route continued until 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Kroessler 2002, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially successful transatlantic traffic has led to the creation of many competing companies, including the [[Red Star Line]] in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;McKay 1969, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Business History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dGig0fYlj8C |author=Charles R.

One of the largest companies in the South Street Seaport area was the [[Fulton Fish Market]], opened in 1822. In 2005, it was moved to the area of [[Hunts Point, Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2012/05/15/vintage_photos_of_the_fulton_fish_market_in_its_glory_days.php |title=Vintage Photos of the Fulton Fish Market in its Glory Days |publisher=Curbed NY |author=Jessica Dailey |date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/nyregion/11cnd-fish.html?_r=0 |title=On Fish Market's Last Day, Tough Guys and Moist Eyes |publisher=The New York Times |author=Andrew Jacobs |date=November 11, 2005 |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1825, the [[Erie Canal]], located upstate, was opened.&lt;ref&gt;Kroessler 2002, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The canal, connecting New York to the [[western United States]], facilitated the economic development of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Howard B.

Buttenwieser |title=Manhattan Water-bound: Manhattan's Waterfront from the Seventeenth Century to the Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KB2MsihpwRQC |edition=2 |work=Syracuse University Press |year=1999 |series=New York City History and Culture Series |page=41 |isbn=0815628013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of December 17, 1835 a large fire in New York City destroyed 17 blocks,&lt;ref&gt;Kroessler 2002, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; and many buildings in the South Street Seaport burned to the ground. Nevertheless, by the 1840s, the port recovered, and by 1850, it reached its heyday:&lt;ref name = "report" /&gt;

{{quote|1= Looking east, was seen in the distance on the long river front from [[Coenties Slip]] to Catharine Street {{sic}}, innumerable masts of the many Californian clippers and London and Liverpool packets, with their long bowsprits extending way over South Street, reaching nearly to the opposite side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Floyd-Jones |title=Backward glances: reminiscences of an old New-Yorker |url=https://archive.org/stream/backwardglancesr00floy |publisher=Unionist Gazette Association |year=1914 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At its peak, the port hosted many commercial enterprises, institutions, ship-chandlers, workshops, boarding houses, saloons, and brothels. However, by the 1880s, the port began to be depleted of resources, space for the development of these businesses was diminishing, and the port became too shallow for newer ships. By the 1930s, most of the piers no longer functioned, and cargo ships docked mainly on ports on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] and in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]].&lt;ref name=encnyc/&gt; By the late 1950s, the old [[Ward Line]] docks, comprising Piers 15, 16, and part of 17, were mostly vacant.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The '''South Street Seaport Museum''' was founded in 1967 by Peter and Norma Stanford. When originally opened as a museum, the focus of the Seaport Museum conservation was to be an educational historic site, with shops mostly operating as reproductions of working environments found during the Seaport's heyday.

In 1982, redevelopment began to turn the museum into a greater [[tourist attraction]] via development of modern shopping areas. The project was undertaken by the prominent developer [[James Rouse]] and modeled on the concept of a "[[festival marketplace]]," a leading revitalization strategy throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_at_l/special_programs/honors_program/seaportproject/rest/development.html |title=Fordham College at Lincoln Center |author=Fordham |publisher= |accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of Fulton Street from Schermerhorn Row, the main Fulton Fish Market building, which had become a large plain garage-type structure, was rebuilt as an upscale [[shopping mall]].  Pier 17's old platforms were demolished and a new glass shopping pavilion raised in its place, which opened in August 1983.

The original intent of the Seaport development was the preservation of the block of buildings known as [[Schermerhorn Row Block|Schermerhorn Row]] on the southwest side of Fulton Street, which were threatened with neglect or future development, at a time when the history of New York City's sailing ship industry was not valued, except by some [[antiquarian]]s. Early historic preservation efforts focused on these buildings and the acquisition of several sailing ships.  Almost all buildings and the entire Seaport neighborhood are meant to transport the visitor back in time to New York's mid-19th century, to demonstrate what life in the commercial maritime trade was like. Docked at the Seaport are a few historical sailing vessels, including the [[Wavertree (ship)|''Wavertree'']]. A section of nearby Fulton Street is preserved as cobblestone and lined with shops, bars, and restaurants. The [[Bridge Cafe]], which claims to be "The Oldest Drinking Establishment in New York" is in a building that formerly housed a brothel.

In 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] heavily damaged the Seaport; tidal floods (seven feet deep in places) inundated much of the Seaport causing extensive damage that forced an end to plans to restore the Museum's fortunes by merging it into the [[Museum of the City of New York]].&lt;ref name=Pogrebim&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pogrebin |first1=Robin |title=Susan Henshaw Jones to Leave Museum of the City of New York |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/arts/design/susan-henshaw-jones-to-leave-museum-of-the-city-of-new-york.html |accessdate=16 April 2015 |publisher=New York Times |date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the businesses closed, and the remaining businesses suffered from a severe drop in business after the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121102/south-street-seaport/south-street-seaport-businesses-struggle-recover-from-sandy-flooding |title=South Street Seaport Businesses Struggle to Recover from Sandy Flooding |work=DNAinfo New York |accessdate=March 14, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923225203/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121102/south-street-seaport/south-street-seaport-businesses-struggle-recover-from-sandy-flooding |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The South Street Seaport Museum re-opened in December 2012.  [[The Howard Hughes Corporation]], the Seaport's owner, announced that it would tear down the Seaport's most prominent shopping area, Pier 17, as part of a broader redevelopment of the neighborhood. The new pier, containing retail, restaurants, and a rooftop performance venue, is set to open in summer 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ny.curbed.com/2018/2/27/17058526/pier-17-south-street-seaport-april-2018-opening|title=South Street Seaport's Pier 17 will start opening this April|work=Curbed NY|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubbed as the godfather of [[Arabs|Arab]] [[accounting]], Abu-Ghazaleh has also been credited for promoting the significance of [[Intellectual Property]] in the [[Arabs|Arab]] [[region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/power100/profile/1044?clr=2&amp;sort=rank|title=Talal Abu-Ghazaleh|date=April 2009|author=arabianbusiness.com}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born on April 22, 1938 in [[Jaffa]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], Abu-Ghazaleh eventually moved to the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] village of [[Ghaziyeh]].

Whilst still an [[undergraduate]], he worked as a [[teacher]] and [[translator]]. His first job after graduating was at [[Saba &amp; Co. IP]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tag-publication.com/UploadFiles/Azaidan/Chairman/Book/Blankets_Become_Jackets.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, upon hearing a speech on [[intellectual property]] (IP) at a Time-Warner conference in [[San Francisco]], USA, Abu-Ghazaleh decided to launch a career in the fields of [[Intellectual property|Intellectual property rights]] (IPRs) and accounting.

In 1972, two [[business entity|firms]] - Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Company (TAGCO) and Abu-Ghazaleh Intellectual Property (AGIP) - were set up, specializing in the fields of accounting and IP respectively. Since then, Abu-Ghazaleh founded a total of 140 professional service firms specialized in various sector fields such as [[management]], [[Consultant|consulting]], [[legal services]], IT and much more.

'''Tori Richard''' is a [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]-based [[company]] which produces men's and women's resort wear. In its nearly 60-year history, the Tori Richard line has gone from exclusively women's [[fashion]]s (featured in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], [[Harper's Bazaar|Harper’s Bazaar]], [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]], [[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]], [[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]], [[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and other national publications)&lt;ref name="Fujii2006a"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a line of upscale [[Resort wear|resort apparel]], including sport shirts, [[Aloha shirt]]s, tropical dresses, [[swimwear]], separates, [[handbag]]s, interior accents and a range of fashion and lifestyle accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tori Richard resort wear targets those who enjoy art, [[travel]] and a casually upscale lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections are introduced biannually in showrooms on the east and west coasts.

Founder Mort Feldman, an avid collector of Japanese [[antiques]] and screens, translated his passion into the [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] fabric prints that remain the Tori Richard signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Textile print as an art form still defines the brand, as do fabrication, construction and attention to detail.

[[CEO]] Josh Feldman, Mort Feldman's son, leads the locally owned [[family business]] as it approaches its 60th year.&lt;ref name="themohs"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Meyers | first = Aviva | title = Tori Richard | url = http://www.themohs.org/Tori_Richard.html | publisher =  | year = 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In two generations, the company has gone from designing primarily women's wear to becoming an international brand. Through its 10 retail stores, website and 2,500 wholesale accounts, Tori Richard is sold in all [[United states|50 states]], [[Mexico]], [[Puerto rico|Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[Caribbean Sea|the Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Rath | first = Paula | title = Flashback | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Apr/26/il/FP604260302.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 26 April 2006 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The newest Tori Richard concept stores, primarily women's stores, are in Honolulu's Kahala Hotel &amp; Resort and Mashpee Cape Cod, Massachusetts. More than 80 percent of Tori Richard sales are [[Continental United States#Hawaii|U.S. mainland-driven]].&lt;ref name="hawaiibusiness"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Ro | first = Lisa | title = Patterns of Success | url = http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/July-2006/Patterns-of-Success/ | publisher = Hawaii Business | date = July 2006 | accessdate = 12 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prints==

[[File:Tori Richard Store in Waikiki.png|thumb|Tori Richard Store in Waikiki]]As many as 100 hours may be required to conceive, design and colorize the design and make each new design printable.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tori Richard gathers concept art year-round from company artists, [[studio]]s, art collections, trade shows, retail outlets and private collections throughout [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[United states|U.S.]]&lt;ref name="Fujii2006" /&gt; An in-house art and design team at the Honolulu [[headquarters]] expands on the concepts to create original Tori Richard resort prints.&lt;ref name="hawaiibusiness" /&gt; They adhere to specific criteria in design, color and placement, aiming for proportion, visual balance, and originality of the final design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When finalized, each TR print is copyrighted, named, and remains the exclusive property of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 400 new prints are added annually to the TR archive, now numbering at least 25,000 designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 42, 64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tori Richard Truck.png|thumb|Tori Richard Truck]]Vital to each print is the number of color screens required.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006" /&gt; Printing a design on silk may require up to 22 screens, and for [[viscose]], 17. Patterns are repeated every 24 to 30 inches, while in the larger “engineered” prints, a single image can take up an entire 60-inch panel.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006" /&gt; Designs range from tightly patterned images to broad, painterly, artistic motifs in both printed and, in the men's Hawaiian shirts, embroidered images. Various visual elements—palette, proportion, mood, message, soft or hard edges—affect the image selection and final print design.

The motifs range from bold geometric prints to botanical, nature-inspired and lifestyle-inspired images. Past designs of Tori Richard's apparel include images of maps, ocean sports, Kiplingesque animals and abstract designs, as well as crisp paisleys and tapa motifs in various fabrications. Variations of popular designs from past collections are sometimes brought back by popular demand. From the beginning, the Japanese aesthetic—stylized waves, water, cranes, fans, chrysanthemum petals, bamboo, textures and brushstrokes—has been prominent in the line.&lt;ref name="themohs" /&gt;

Tori Richard has recently released its vintage-inspired 56 series, with its own signature themes, fabrications and a more tapered cut. Emblematic of 56 is the cotton, treated for the vintage-washed effect aimed towards the younger demographic. The Tori Richard line also includes seasonal themes in high-end fabrics, with embroidered, engineered designs in heavyweight silks.

Tori Richard pioneered the matched [[pocket]]s and fronts, now an industry standard. This feature matches the print so there is no interruption in design at the pocket or front seams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fabrications and Styles==
Tori Richard fabrics include [[silk]]s, silk blends, [[Pima cotton]], cotton blends, [[linen]] and linen blends, [[tencel|Tencel©]], cotton jacquard and spun viscose, as well as a fine proprietary Egyptian cotton called cotton lawn, giving a finish exclusive to Tori Richard.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_a"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Rath | first = Paula | title = Resort Style | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/Aug/07/il/hawaii908070318.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 7 August 2009 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-end silks, such as silk jacquard, also appear in single, bold embroidered patterns comprising the more luxurious end of the men's line. Some of the fabrics are made in Japan, unusual among retailers today.

==Details and Workmanship==
The details of a Tori Richard shirt include laser-etched [[Mother of pearl|mother-of-pearl]] [[Button (clothing)|button]]s, French [[Seam (sewing)|seams]] (raw edges turned in, sewn and invisible), matched pockets, and [[Collar (clothing)|collars]] with interlining, an extra layer of fabric fused to the inside of the collar to add crispness and prevent droop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Fashion==
[[File:The Tori Richard store in the Hilton Hawaiian Village.png|thumb|The exterior of the Tori Richard store in the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii]]Tori Richard's women's line includes dresses, [[capris]], tops, [[tunic]]s, peplum tanks, beach cover-ups, [[sarong]]-style and asymmetrical skirts, as well as shorts and modernized caftans in black, exotic prints and casual geometrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colors are inspired by the dunes of Marrakech, the deserts of Africa, autumn in the northeast, nature and deep ocean. The women's resort wear goes from day to evening and from beach to dinner, casual to elegant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 86–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Styles range from off-shoulder, one-shoulder, strapless and spaghetti-strap dresses to skinny, shirred and dolman-sleeved tops paired with skinny pants in all lengths and contemporary cuts.

Fabrics include cotton, cotton [[crape|crepe]], [[rayon]], [[jersey knit]] blends, cotton-spandex [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]], and silk and silk blends, selected for drape, comfort and versatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Rath | first = Paula | title = Fashion News | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/May/15/il/hawaii905150325.html | date = 15 May 2009| accessdate = 16 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prints for the women's line range from tapa-inspired tribal prints, botanical motifs, abstract geometricals and art-inspired motifs for a global resort market.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_a" /&gt;

==History==
While known for its resort wear and Hawaiian shirts, Tori Richard got its beginnings in women's wear.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_b"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Nakaso | first = Dan | title = Mortimer Feldman | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/Aug/16/ln/hawaii908160318.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 16 August 2009 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founder Mort Feldman, an apparel manufacturer from Chicago, flew to the Territory of Hawaii in 1953 on [[Pan American Airways|Pan American's]] [[China Clipper]], intending to retire.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_b" /&gt;   He established the company in 1956.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_b" /&gt;   With partners Janice Moody, formerly a sportswear designer for Catalina, and Mitsue Aka, Moody's pattern maker, he formed Tori Richard with one sewing machine and practically no capital.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_b" /&gt;  They named the company after Victoria (Tori, Moody's daughter) and Richard, Feldman's oldest son.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;

Their first office, at Pier 7 in Honolulu, was known to have floorboards that became damp from the tide rising in [[Honolulu harbor|Honolulu Harbor]].&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;  Among its early offices were a [[Quonset hut]] and the historic [[Primo Brewing &amp; Malting Company|Primo Brewery]], damaged by fire in 1973 and rebuilt to remain the company headquarters for 17 more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Gordon | first = Mike | title = Mort Feldman of Tori Richard | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Nov/12/ln/ln59p.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 12 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after its 1956 launch, Tori Richard became nationally known for the unfussy [[Silhouettes#Fashion and fitness|silhouettes]], bright colors and dramatic prints of the dresses, culottes, beachwear, caftans and lounge wear of its high-fashion resort women's line, made largely of imported European fabrics at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Offices in key mainland markets—[[New York (state)|New York]], [[California]], [[Florida]], [[Dallas]] and [[Chicago]]—attracted attention from high-end retailers, such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord &amp; Taylor, Bergdorf Goodman, Gimbel's, I. Magnin, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Best &amp; Co. and Marshall Field.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006a" /&gt;

[[File:The interior of the Tori Richard store in the Hyatt Regency Waikiki.png|thumb|The interior of the Tori Richard store in the Hyatt Regency Waikiki]]In the 1960s and ‘70s, [[Fifth avenue#Shopping|Fifth Avenue]] windows and top national fashion magazines featured Tori Richard in features and ads, many of them photographed on location in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006b"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the leisure life was the zeitgeist of the era, the Tori Richard fashions—tunics, harem pants, hostess sets, shifts, caftans, culottes, sarong swimsuits and Capri pants—catered to the cocktail, beach and patio parties that were popular at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The esthetics—streamlined and dramatic—departed from the tropical “aloha wear” for which Hawaii was known.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006b" /&gt;  Customers ranged from [[Lucille ball|Lucille Ball]] to the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] to department store customers across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Mort Feldman and a fellow Hawaii fashion executive, Howard Hope, lobbied the [[Hawaii Legislature|Hawaii State Legislature]] to establish “Aloha Friday” as a state-sanctioned island practice.&lt;ref name="themohs" /&gt;  The effort succeeded, and businesses throughout the state wear aloha attire on Fridays, and, increasingly, on the other days of the week.

The company grew during the boom years of Hawaii [[tourism]]. From the early 1960s, soon after [[Hawaii statehood|statehood]] in 1959 and the introduction of jet travel to Hawaii, fashion emerged as the third largest export of the state, with Tori Richard as one of the biggest fashion exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =  | first =  | title = Hawaii's Glamour Garments | journal = Beacon | volume =  | issue = April | year = 1962 | pages = 8  | postscript =  &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[File:Joshua Feldman.png|thumb|Joshua Feldman, CEO of Tori Richard and son of founder Mortimer Feldman.]]Cotton lawn, now a staple of the company with its proprietary finish, debuted in the 1970s and became a mainstay of the men's line.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006c"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, menswear eclipsed women's wear in the Tori Richard line.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;  In 1983, Mort Feldman retired to New Zealand, to return to the U. S. three years later. His son, Josh, a graduate of [[Punahou School]] and the [[UC San Diego|University of California at San Diego]], with a degree in art and a degree in political science, dropped his ambitions for [[law school]] and joined Tori Richard in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Kam | first = Nadine | title = Tori Five-O: The clothing company Tori Richard recaptures its storied early success | publisher = Honolulu Star-Bulletin | date = 5 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the younger Feldman's leadership, the company grew by over 600 percent.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006c" /&gt;

Upon his return in 1994, Josh Feldman managed the print and product division of the company. He re-introduced the engineered print to the product line in 1995 and redoubled efforts to identify Tori Richard as a print house.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;

In 2002, the women's line was relaunched, and a year later, the first Tori Richard retail store opened at the [[Hyatt|Hyatt Regency Waikīkī]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = One To Watch: Tori Richard's new womenswear designer brings a fresh feel to the iconic island brand | url = http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Shops-Waikiki/June-2012/One-To-Watch/ | publisher = Honolulu Magazine | date = June 2012 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today there are Tori Richard shops at [[Ala Moana Center]], The Shops at Wailea, [[Royal Hawaiian Hotel]], [[Hilton Hawaiian Village]] and Whaler's Village in Ka‘anapali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Tori Richard | first =  | title = Find A Store | url = http://www.toririchard.com/page.cfm/LOCATIONS.html | publisher = Tori Richard | date =  | accessdate = 8 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The year 2006 saw the company's 50th anniversary and was also the year Tori Richard received the “Resort Retailer of the Year” award from Retail Merchants Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Advertiser Staff | first =  | title = Jeans Warehouse wins Retailer of Year | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Oct/28/bz/FP610280329.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 28 October 2006 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2012, the readers of the ''[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]'' voted Tori Richard “Best of the Best” in the aloha shirt category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Hawaii's Best 2012 | url = http://www.staradvertiser.com/specialprojects/2012/hawaiisbest2012/hawaiisbest2012.html?id=171852751 | publisher = Honolulu Star-Advertiser | date = 24 June 2012 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yaron Kanner''' is an Israeli social entrepreneur and lawyer, director of the [https://merkazhinam.wixsite.com/hinam-center-wix-en Hinam Center] for Social Tolerance.

== Biography ==
Yaron Kanner was born in Tel Aviv in 1968. He studied at the Netiv Meir High School in Jerusalem and later at Yeshivat Ateret Cohanim (today known as Yeshivat Ateret Yerushalayim). He served in the "Shimshon" undercover unit in the IDF during the First Intifada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/533129|title=ירון קנר: "אין תחליף להיכרות עם האחר" {{!}} ישראל היום|work=ישראל היום|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnews.co.il/stories/5113|title="יגאל עמיר הביט בי בחשדנות ושאל: "מי אתה? מאיפה אתה בא?"|website=www.mnews.co.il|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, he served as a correspondent for Israel Radio's Channel 2 network and, among others, was the first reporter to broadcast live on Israel Radio that shots were fired at then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Later he broadcast a documentary program on television, mainly during "The Diary" on the IBA’s First Channel. He was also a reporter for Yedioth Ahronoth, writing for the "7 Days" supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnews.co.il/stories/5113|title="יגאל עמיר הביט בי בחשדנות ושאל: "מי אתה? מאיפה אתה בא?"|website=www.mnews.co.il|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working as a journalist, he began to study social law. As a lawyer, he served as the director of the Legal Department of the Tebeka Association and led legal battles against the private and institutional discrimination of members of the Ethiopian community. Among others, he was one of the leaders of the legal struggle in the affair of the "Nezer Etzion" school in Petach Tikvah, whose students (except one) were members of the Ethiopian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.walla.co.il/item/1856479|title=דעה: סגירת בית הספר נר עציון רצף של טעויות - וואלה! חדשות|work=וואלה! חדשות|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he-IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000723886#utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=facebook|title=עו"ד ירון קנר מונה למנכ"ל החדש של רדיו קול ברמה|last=ברק|first=רועי|website=גלובס|language=he|access-date=2018-09-15|date=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a Journalist ==
The investigative reports that Kanner published in Yedioth Ahronoth were characterized by an active approach, in which the journalist is not satisfied with presenting the evidence alone to prove the subject of his investigation, but is actively involved in the investigation itself. This way Kanner tried to produce articles that benefitted from high credibility.

About two months before the assassination of then Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Kanner entered the Eyal organization, where Yigal Amir was a member. During his recruitment to the organization, Avishai Raviv visited his home, and after that Kanner held meetings with Yigal Amir and Hagai Amir in Hebron and was due to join the organization as a weapons instructor. The purpose of the debriefing was to examine the intentions of the organization and its members, in light of their public threats against Yitzhak Rabin. The investigative report, which was planned to continue for several months, was interrupted by Rabin's assassination. Kanner immediately published a series of articles about his meetings with Yigal Amir and the other members of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.news1.co.il/ArticlePage.aspx%3fdocid%3d106912%26subjectid%3d3%26TransID%3d0%26AfterAdd%3d1|title=לא חשבתי אחרת|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner served, at the time, as a reporter for the Israel Radio network. On November 4, 1995, he was sent by the radio network to cover the "Yes to Peace, No to Violence" rally held at Malkhei Yisrael Square (today Rabin Square in Tel Aviv). As stated, Kanner was the first reporter to report that shots were fired at Yitzhak Rabin as he descended the back stairs of the stage toward his car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=yaron kanner|title=רצח רבין - הדיווח הראשון|date=2008-08-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amybp7tRGnA&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.10.tv/documentary/132387|title=לא חשבתי שהוא יצחק - הסרט המלא|website=ערוץ עשר|language=he|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Kanner conducted an investigation into forced psychiatric hospitalization, in which he managed to bring about his own hospitalization at the [http://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%96_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%90%D7%99_%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A9_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%9C Abarbanel Psychiatric Hospital] for four days, following fictitious letters of complaint he sent to the Tel Aviv District Psychiatrist. In this, Kanner proved that the district psychiatrist was not conducting the necessary tests before ordering forced hospitalization. Following a series of articles published on the subject, an investigation committee was set up by the Ministry of Health, and some of the legal requirements relating to forced hospitalization were changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shemtov1.com/lor/tag/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%A8-%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%95%D7%98-%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%94-5-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%9C/|title=ירון קנר סיוט במחלקה 5 בית חולים אברבנל – לורי שם טוב מידעו"ס ומשפטפטת|website=shemtov1.com|language=he-IL|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://isra-health.blogspot.com/2014/12/Yaron-Kaner.html|title=פסיכיאטריה: משוגע בעל כורחו - ירון קנר - ידיעות אחרונות - 16.8.1996|website=פסיכיאטריה|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://social2017blog.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%A8-%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%96-%D7%90%D7%AA-%D7%A2%D7%A6%D7%9E%D7%95-%D7%91%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%9B%D7%93%D7%99-%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%93/amp/|title=ירון קנר אשפז את עצמו ב'אברבנאל' כדי לבדוק מה קורה בחדרי החדרים של המוסד|date=2014-12-11|work=חדשות רווחה|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he-IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://social2017blog.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%95%D7%98-%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%94-5-%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%A8-7-%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%97%D7%A8/amp/|title=סיוט במחלקה 5 – ירון קנר – 7 ימים – ידיעות אחרונות – 23.08.1996|date=2014-12-11|work=חדשות רווחה|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he-IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://alaxon.co.il/article/%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A9-%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91-%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%90%D7%94/|title=ציפור הנפש שוב כלואה – אלכסון|website=alaxon.co.il|language=he-IL|access-date=2018-09-15|date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/mlbdebate1/home/4/yaron-kenrer|title=ירון קנר - MLB Debate|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His journalistic approach aroused controversy over the extent of the journalist's proper involvement in the subject of his investigation, as well as ethical questions related to the legitimacy of impersonation and misrepresentation of the authorities in order to expose information of public importance.

== In the World of Tolerance ==
Kanner advocates promoting a tolerant society through a long and meaningful acquaintance with the other.  The Hinam Center that he founded applies this approach through in-depth journeys into the Israeli society where participants live "the lives of others" and spend extended periods of time  in various communities in Israeli society (ultra-Orthodox, Arabs, settlers, Ethiopians, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/an-alternative-schedule-for-vp-pence/|title=An alternative schedule for VP Pence|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jewishlinknj.com/community-news/bergen/25129-yi-of-teaneck-hosts-mk-glick-hinam-s-kanner|title=YI of Teaneck Hosts MK Glick, Hinam’s Kanner|last=Staff|first=JLNJ|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jewishfed.org/2014/03/03/gvanim-10-1|title=Jewish Pluralism, Bay Area Style: Israeli Gvanim Fellows Travel to the Bay for Cultural Exchange|work=Jewish Community Federation|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/2018/09/07/a-lesson-in-co-existence/?platform=hootsuite|title=A lesson in co-existence - Israel Hayom|date=2018-09-07|work=Israel Hayom|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/533129|title=ירון קנר: "אין תחליף להיכרות עם האחר" {{!}} ישראל היום|work=ישראל היום|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5013783,00.html|title=הינם כאן|last=חבוט|first=אילנית סולומונוביץ'|date=2017-08-09|work=Ynet|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zsa Zsa Gabor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʒ|ɑː|ʒ|ɑː|_|ˈ|g|ɑː|b|ɔr|,_|-|g|ə|ˈ|b|ɔr}} {{respell|ZHAH|zhah|_|GAH|bor|,_-|gə|BOR}}; {{IPA-hu|ˈʒɒʒɒ ˈɡaːbor|lang}}; born '''Sári Gábor''' {{IPA-hu|ˈʃaːri ˈɡaːbor|}}; February 6, 1917&amp;nbsp;– December 18, 2016) was a [[Hungarian Americans|Hungarian-American]] actress and socialite. Her sisters were actresses [[Eva Gabor|Eva]] and [[Magda Gabor]].

Gabor began her stage career in [[Vienna]] and was crowned [[Miss Hungary]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hischak, Thomas S. ''The Oxford Companion to the American Musical: Theatre, Film, and Television'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2008, p.271&lt;/ref&gt; She emigrated from [[Hungary]] to the United States in 1941.  Becoming a sought-after actress with "European flair and style", she was considered to have a personality that "exuded charm and grace".&lt;ref&gt;Barris, George. ''Barris Cars of the Stars'', MBI Publishing (2008), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Her first film role was a supporting role in ''[[Lovely to Look At]]''. She later acted in ''[[We're Not Married!]]'' and played one of her few leading roles in the [[John Huston]]-directed film, ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (1952).  Huston would later describe her as a "creditable" actress.&lt;ref&gt;Huston, John. ''John Huton: Interviews'', Univ. Press of Mississippi (2001), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside her acting career, Gabor was known for her extravagant Hollywood lifestyle, her glamorous personality, and her many marriages.  In total, Gabor had nine husbands, including hotel magnate [[Conrad Hilton]] and actor [[George Sanders]]. She once stated, "Men have always liked me and I have always liked men. But I like a mannish man, a man who knows how to talk to and treat a woman—not just a man with muscles."&lt;ref&gt;"Love Hints from Zsa Zsa", ''Life Magazine'', October 15, 1951 (cover story).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and ancestry==
Zsa Zsa Gabor was born Sári Gábor on February 6, 1917&lt;ref name="yearofbirth"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret Is Out: Zsa Zsa is 72|publisher=News Archive|date=November 3, 1989|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/The-Secret-Is-Out-Zsa-Zsa-is-72/id-7137f427bd21050bce56707127104950|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Budapest]], [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungary]], then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].&lt;ref name="yearofbirth" /&gt; The middle of three daughters, her parents were Vilmos, a soldier, and [[Jolie Gabor]] (née Janka Tilleman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/29/Zsa-Zsa-Gabor.html|title=Zsa Zsa Gabor profile at|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolie Gabor's date of birth was September 30, 1896, although most sources cite September 29, but September 30 date and her name at birth as "Janka" not "Jansci" are supported by her birth certificate.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were both of [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] ancestry. While her mother escaped Hungary during the same time period of the Nazi occupation of Budapest, Gabor left the country in 1941, three years prior to the takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.jpost.com/Not-Just-News/Trending-Now/Jewish-born-Hollywood-star-Zsa-Zsa-Gabor-dies-at-age-99-475820#article=6019RjVENTY3RjI3NTRBMUE3MDE5MDdFNzc4MzdDQzhERTQ= |title=Jewish-born Hollywood star Zsa Zsa Gabor dies at age 99 |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=December 19, 2016 |accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/auf-wiedersehen-darling-a-tribute-to-the-inimitable-zsa-zsa-gabor/a-36821518 "'Auf Wiedersehen, Darling': A tribute to the inimitable Zsa Zsa Gabor"], ''Deutsche Welle'' (DW), December 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cindy.

Gabor's elder sister, [[Magda Gabor|Magda]], eventually became an American socialite and her younger sister, [[Eva Gabor|Eva]], became an American actress and businesswoman. The Gabor sisters were first cousins of Annette Lantos, wife of California Congressman [[Tom Lantos]] (D-CA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/press/2007/holocaust-helped-shape-lantos|title=Holocaust helped shape Lantos' path|work=raoulwallenberg.net|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
According to Gabor, she was discovered by operatic tenor [[Richard Tauber]] on a trip to [[Vienna]] in 1934, following her time as a student at a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] boarding school. Tauber invited Gabor to sing the [[soubrette]] role in his new [[operetta]], ''Der singende Traum'' (''The Singing Dream''), at the [[Theater an der Wien]].  This would mark her first stage appearance. In 1936, she was crowned Miss Hungary.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/18/movies/zsa-zsa-gabor-often-married-actress-known-for-glamour-dies.html "Zsa Zsa Gabor, Often-Married Actress Known for Glamour, Dies at 99"], ''The New York Times'', December 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Zsa Zsa Gabor - Ray - 1953.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dancing with director [[Nicholas Ray]] (1953)]]
In 1944, she co-wrote a novel with writer Victoria Wolf entitled ''Every Man For Himself''.  According to Gabor, the fictional story was derived, in a small part, from Gabor's life experiences.  The book was subsequently bought by an American magazine.&lt;ref name="Novel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/iowa/waterloo/waterloo-daily-courier/1944/02-23/page-8?tag=zsa+zsa+hilton&amp;rtserp=tags/?pep=zsa-zsa-hilton|title=Zsa Zsa Hilton|publisher=Waterloo Daily Courier|date=February 23, 1944|accessdate=May 28, 2016|author=Parsons, Louella|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Gabor declined an offer to play the leading role in a film version of the classic book ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''.  According to an article written the Cedar Rapids Gazette in 1949, she turned down the role of Lady Chatterley due to the story's controversial theme.&lt;ref name="Chatterley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/iowa/cedar-rapids/cedar-rapids-gazette/1949/11-28/page-22?tag=zsa+zsa+gabor&amp;rtserp=tags/?pep=zsa-zsa-gabor&amp;ndt=by&amp;py=1940&amp;pey=1949|title=Snapshots of Hollywood|publisher=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=November 28, 1949|accessdate=May 28, 2016|author=Parsons, Louella|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her more serious film acting credits include ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'', ''[[Lovely to Look At]]'' and ''[[We're Not Married!]]'', all from 1952, and 1953’s ''[[Lili]]''. In 1958, she ran the gamut of moviemaking, from ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958) to the camp oddity ''[[Queen of Outer Space]]'' (1958).

Author [[Gerold Frank]], who helped Gabor write her autobiography in 1960, described his impressions of her:&lt;blockquote&gt;Zsa Zsa is unique.

In his autobiography, television host [[Merv Griffin]], who was known to spend time with Gabor's younger sister Eva socially, wrote of the Gabor sisters' initial presence in New York and Hollywood: "All these years later, it's hard to describe the phenomenon of the three glamorous Gabor girls and their ubiquitous mother. They burst onto the [[Society reporting|society pages]] and into the gossip columns so suddenly, and with such force, it was as if they'd been dropped out of the sky."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Merv.

Gabor was married nine times. She was divorced seven times, and one marriage was [[annulment|annulled]]. "All in all&amp;nbsp;— I love being married", she wrote in her autobiography. "I love the companionship, I love cooking for a man (simple things like chicken soup and my special Dracula's goulash from Hungary), and spending all my time with a man.

Gabor's divorces inspired her to make numerous quotable puns and innuendos about her marital (and extramarital) history. She commented: "I am a marvelous housekeeper: Every time I leave a man I keep his house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovalbooks.com/xeno/Hungarians.html|title=Xenophobe's guide to the Hungarians|publisher=Ovalbooks.com|accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabor later claimed to have had a sexual encounter with her stepson, [[Conrad Hilton, Jr.|Nicky]].&lt;ref name=Bennetts /&gt;

In 1970, Gabor purchased a nearly 9,000-square-foot [[Hollywood Regency]]-style home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]], which once belonged to [[Elvis Presley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2436988/inside-zsa-zsa-gabors-opulent-26-room-mansion-that-was-once-home-to-elvis-presley/|title=Inside Zsa Zsa Gabor's opulent 26-room mansion that was once home to Elvis Presley|date=2016-12-19|work=The Sun|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where the Beatles visited him in 1965.

However, the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]], Santa Monica, threw out the case due to Gabor's failure to appear in court or to sign an [[affidavit]] that she indeed was a [[Plaintiff|co-plaintiff]] on the original lawsuit filed by her husband, Frédéric von Anhalt.

Gabor and her last husband, [[Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt]], adopted at least ten adult males who paid them a fee of up to $2,000,000 to become descendants by adoption of [[Princess Marie-Auguste of Anhalt]].

On June 14, 1989, in [[Beverly Hills, California]], Gabor was accused of slapping the face of Beverly Hills police officer Paul Kramer when he stopped her for a traffic violation at 8551 [[Olympic Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Olympic Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mugshots.net/zsa_zsa_gabor Profile], Mugshots.net {{webarchive| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603074355/http://www.mugshots.net/zsa_zsa_gabor| date=June 3, 2004}}; retrieved April 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  At trial three months later, a jury convicted her of slapping Kramer.  They also found her guilty of driving without a license and possessing an open container of alcohol&amp;nbsp;— a flask of [[Jack Daniel's]]&amp;nbsp;— in her $215,000 [[Rolls-Royce]], but acquitted her of the charge of disobeying Kramer when she drove away from the traffic stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-30/news/mn-168_1_zsa-zsa-gabor|title='I Can't Believe It', She Says: Zsa Zsa Gabor Convicted of Slapping Police Officer|author=David Ferrell and Edmund Newton|website=Los Angeles Times|date=September 30, 1989|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 25, 1989, Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles G.

Gabor had a long-running feud with German-born actress [[Elke Sommer]] that began in 1984 when both appeared on ''[[Circus of the Stars]]'' and escalated into a multimillion-dollar [[libel]] suit by 1993.  The suit resulted in an order for Gabor and her husband to pay Sommer $3.3 million in general and punitive damages.&lt;ref name="pool1993"&gt;Pool, Bob.

On January 25, 2009, the [[Associated Press]] reported that her attorney stated that [[forensic accountant]]s determined that Gabor may have lost as much as $10 million [[Madoff investment scandal|invested in]] [[Bernard Madoff|Bernie Madoff's]] company, possibly through a third-party money manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5590788.ece "Gabor's Husband Says They Lost $10 Million Due to Madoff"], ''The Times Online'', January 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life and health===
On November 27, 2002, Gabor was a front seat passenger in an automobile crash on [[Sunset Boulevard]], Los Angeles, from which she remained partially paralyzed and reliant on a wheelchair for mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2002/11/29/zsa-zsa-gabor-seriously-hurt-after-car-crash.html|title=Zsa Zsa Gabor Seriously Hurt After Car Crash|date=29 November 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/gabor-get-2-million-car-crash-wbna7093685|title=Gabor to get $2 million for car crash|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She survived strokes in 2005 and 2007 and underwent surgeries.
