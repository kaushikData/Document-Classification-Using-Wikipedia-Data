'''Airsynergy''' is a privately owned [[renewable energy]] product development and licensing company, which was founded in 2008 by Jim Smyth, Andrew Smyth, Gerard Smyth, Peter Smyth, David Smyth and Adrian Kelly.  Airsynergy produces cleantech products which generate an affordable, secure and reliable power supply. The company is based in [[Granard]], county [[Longford]], [[Ireland]], with other offices based in Dublin, Ireland.

== Products ==
'''Total Energy Solution (TES)'''

Airsynergy’s TES is a small-scale wind turbine which has been built to maximise power production. The TES is a two-in-one turbine which contains not only a standard rotor and blades, but also a multi-bladed duct augmenter. This augmenter concentrates and amplifies air from the inside out, increasing the speed of the wind flowing past the two-bladed rotor system. This means that the system can cut in at significantly lower wind speeds compared to conventional wind turbines, and provide double the power production (AEP) of similarly rated turbines.

The TES has the ability to generate €4,000 plus worth of electricity per year, and offers fixed power prices for up to 30 years.

'''Renewable Power Unit (RPU)'''

Airsynergy’s RPU is a hybrid wind and solar powered streetlight which contains both a solar panel and a small, duct augmented wind turbine, which together generate enough energy to provide street lighting. The duct augmented turbine is able to accelerate the surrounding air, increasing the total blade revolutions per minute.

The RPU is the most powerful hybrid solution on the market – as it provides approximately 1200kWh annual energy production at 5&amp;nbsp;m/s. This [[solution]] also contains a turbine which can ‘cut in’ sooner and increase the power output when there are low wind speeds – a critical feature which ensures reliable and powerful lighting. The energy produced from the RPU can also be used to provide power for CCTV security cameras, Wi-Fi at bus stops, phone-charging and other micro-power needs.

== onesynergy ==
onesynergy, founded in 2008, is the sister company of Airsynergy, and it is a company which invents, designs and builds Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning products (HVAC). These HVAC products are ideal components for a variety of commercial, industrial and agricultural buildings as well as residential properties.

'''PAVEL'''

PAVEL is onesynergy’s aerodynamic air extraction unit which halves the total energy consumption of a building, cutting both carbon emissions and energy bills. This extraction unit contains patented technology which means that it can achieve optimum air flow efficiency via the gradual deceleration of air and its gentle diffusion into the air at low velocity.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The PAVEL has already received third party verification for its performance. Moore Environmental, an independent commissioning and validation engineering company, have certified the PAVEL’s volume flow rate against power. The PAVEL unit offers approximately 55 per cent power savings in comparison to a standard extraction unit or exhaust cowl.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

== Partners ==
'''Aris Renewables Energy, LLC'''

In 2013, Airsynergy entered into an exclusive license agreement in the United States with New York-based Aris Renewables Energy, LLC. Airsynergy has granted Aris a royalty bearing patent license (up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW) to develop, manufacture and sell wind turbines and wind powered street-lights utilising Airsynergy’s patented enhancement technologies. The license covers the United States and the Caribbean. Aris is also acting as an agent for Airsynergy to secure other licensees in South America.

'''Fairhaven H&amp;V Services'''

Fairhaven H&amp;V Services are a stockist and distributor of ventilation and air movement products, supplying to the construction and industrial trade sectors.[[# ftn2|[2]]]

'''Ariston Thermo SpA''' is an Italian corporation that produces heating systems and related products, marketed mainly under the Ariston, Chaffoteaux, Elco, Racold, Atag, NTI, HTP, Cuenod, Ecoflam and Thermowatt brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ariston.com/corporate/en/brand|title=Our brands|publisher=Ariston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1930, Aristide Merloni founded Industrie Merloni in the [[Marche]]s and began producing scales. The production of electric water heaters dates back to 1960, with the appearance of the Ariston brand, which would propel the Group to leader status in this sector in Italy with the dawn of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museodelmarchioitaliano.com/route1/ariston.php|title=Ariston|publisher=Museo del marchio italiano|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103172958/http://www.museodelmarchioitaliano.com/route1/ariston.php|archivedate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of Ariston [[water heating|heaters]], in the 1980s the company decided to enter the space heating sector and started manufacturing boilers.

During the 1990s the company opened its first branches in Eastern Europe and Asia. In the same years Ariston Thermo acquired Racold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19990422/ibu22183.html|title=MTS group to invest Rs 30 cr in Chakan plant|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023085500/http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19990422/ibu22183.html|archive-date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's largest water heaters' manufacturer, and opened its first wholly owned plant in China.

The early 21st century saw the acquisition in 2001 of several historical companies and brands in the heating and burner sectors, namely: Chaffoteaux, Elco, Cuenod and Rendamax.

Over the two-year period 2004–2005, new plants were inaugurated in [[Hanoi]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]], while the acquisition of Ecoflam was completed, the latter among Italy's leading companies for heating systems; in 2008, after the acquisition of Termogamma SA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soldionline.it/notizie/azioni-italia/mts-group-acquisisce-la-svizzera-termogamma-sa|title=MTS Group acquisisce la svizzera Termogamma SA|language=Italian|publisher=Soldionline}}&lt;/ref&gt; specialised in the production of heat pumps, the company opened its European centre of excellence for solar heating systems in Italy, in [[Serra de' Conti]].
In 2009, the company (until then part of MTS Group) changed its name to Ariston Thermo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milanofinanza.it/news/mts-group-cambia-nome-in-ariston-thermo-group-200903021416001110|publisher=Milano Finanza|title=Mts Group: cambia nome in Ariston Thermo Group|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ariston Thermo acquired in 2011 Cipag SA and Domotec AG, leaders in Switzerland for the production, distribution and maintenance of water heating systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/marche/2011/07/11/visualizza_new.html_787057524.html Ansa – Ariston Thermo acquires Cipag and Domotec&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 saw the acquisition of DhE, an Italian company specialised in heating elements for commercial and industrial applications, and the set up of a joint venture for the production and commercialisation in [[Uzbekistan]] of domestic heating systems.

In 2014, the company entered the South African market directly through the acquisition of Heat Tech Geysers, the country's second player for water heaters, and inaugurated an electric water heater factory in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=262489759|title=Company Overview of Heat Tech Geysers (Pty) Ltd|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnambreakingnews.com/2014/04/italian-water-heating-firm-opens-18mn-plant-in-vietnam/|title=Italian water heating firm opens $18mn plant in Vietnam|publisher=Vietnam Breaking News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same year it also strengthened its presence in mature markets with the acquisition of ATAG Heating, a Dutch high-end brand in the heating industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buildersmerchantsnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9895/Ariston_Thermo_acquires_ATAG_Heating.html Ariston Thermo acquires ATAG Heating&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.verwarming.nl/nieuws/ATAG+Heating+wordt+onderdeel+van+Ariston+Thermo.html?contentID=6130 ATAG Heating, een belangrijke speler op de Benelux verwarmingsmarkt, wordt onderdeel van Ariston Thermo, een wereldspeler op het gebied van verwarming en warmwaterbereiding&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, signed the acquisition of Gastech-Energi A/S, a leading company in the field of domestic and industrial heating in [[Denmark]], announced during the inauguration in Russia of a new logistics center of approximately 10,000 m² in the production site of [[Vsevolozhsk]], nearby St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anecta.se/Ariston-Thermo-f%C3%B6rv%C3%A4rvar-marknadsledande-v%C3%A4rmeinstallat%C3%B6r.aspx Tramslink advises Ariston Thermo in acquisition in Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Ariston Thermo announced the acquisition of the majority stake in NY Thermal Inc., a company based in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John (Canada)]], operating in the domestic and commercial NTI branded condensing boilers in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilgiornaledeltermoidraulico.it/ariston-thermo-entra-nel-mercato-nord-americano-con-lacquisizione-di-nti/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcinews.it/2016/09/26/ariston-thermo-entra-nel-mercato-nord-americano-con-lacquisizione-di-nti-leader-nel-riscaldamento-idronico-a-condensazione/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commercioidrotermosanitario.it/ariston-thermo-entra-nel-mercato-nord-americano-lacquisizione-nti/&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2017 the Group completed two further acquisitions, one in the United States of America, where in August Ariston Thermo acquired HTP,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/impresa-e-territori/2017-08-01/dopo-canada-usa-ariston-thermo-cresce-america-nord-174355.shtml?uuid=AEXYmD7B/&lt;/ref&gt; a leading company in this market for thermal comfort solutions, and the other in Israel in October acquiring ATMOR Group,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/impresa-e-territori/2017-09-28/ariston-thermo-cresce-all-estero-e-investe-israele-175524.shtml?uuid=AEFpSSbC/&lt;/ref&gt; a leading company in the technology of electric instantaneous water heaters.

Also in 2017 two Ariston products - the instant electric water heater Aures Luxury Round and the brand new Lydos Hybrid, the first Class A hybrid electric water heater - were won the GOOD DESIGN ™ awards in the "Bath &amp; Accessories" and "Building materials" categories”.&lt;ref&gt;http://good-designawards.com/award-details.html?award=31322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://good-designawards.com/award-details.html?award=31449&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 Ariston’s victories follow the one archived in 2016 with the state-of-the-art gas boiler Alteas,&lt;ref&gt;https://chi-athenaeum.org/building-products/materials-2016/2016/12/03/new-ariston-wall-hung-boilers-(alteas-and-genus)-2015/&lt;/ref&gt; awarded due to its innovative silhouette and its fine materials, impeccable details and user-friendliness

[[File:Bibf hot air balloon.jpg|thumb|A hot air balloon in flight.]]
[[File:Breitling Orbiter 3 aloft.jpg|thumb|In 1999, [[Bertrand Piccard]] and [[Brian Jones (aeronaut)|Brian Jones]] achieved the first non-stop balloon [[circumnavigation]] in ''[[Breitling Orbiter 3]]''.]]

In [[aeronautics]], a '''balloon''' is an unpowered [[aerostat]], which remains aloft or floats due to its [[buoyancy]]. A balloon may be free, moving with the wind, or [[Moored balloon|tethered]] to a fixed point. It is distinct from an [[airship]], which is a powered [[aerostat]] that can propel itself through the air in a controlled manner.

{{Anchor|Gondola}}Many balloons have a [[basket]], [[gondola (airship)|gondola]], or capsule suspended beneath the main envelope for carrying people or equipment (including cameras and [[telescope]]s, and flight-control mechanisms).

==Principles==
A [[balloon]] is conceptually the simplest of all flying machines. The balloon is a fabric envelope filled with a gas that is [[lighter than air|lighter than the surrounding atmosphere]]. As the entire balloon is less [[density|dense]] than its surroundings, it rises, taking along with it a basket, attached underneath, which carries passengers or payload.  Although a balloon has no propulsion system, a degree of directional control is possible through making the balloon rise or sink in altitude to find favorable wind directions.

There are three main types of balloon:
*The [[hot air balloon]] or ''Montgolfière'' obtains its buoyancy by heating the air inside the balloon; it has become the most common type.
*The [[gas balloon]] or ''Charlière'' is inflated with a gas of lower [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] than the ambient atmosphere; most gas balloons operate with the internal pressure of the gas the same as the [[atmospheric pressure|pressure of the surrounding atmosphere]]; a [[superpressure balloon]] can operate with the [[lifting gas]] at pressure that exceeds that of the surrounding air, with the objective of limiting or eliminating the loss of gas from day-time heating; gas balloons are filled with gases such as:
**[[hydrogen]] – originally used extensively but, since the [[Hindenburg disaster]], is now seldom used due to its high flammability;
**[[coal gas]] – although giving around half the lift of hydrogen,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Richard (2013). ''Falling Upwards''. London: Collins. {{ISBN|978-0-00-738692-5}}. p.57&lt;/ref&gt; extensively used during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, since it was cheaper than hydrogen and readily available;
**[[helium]] – used today for all airships and most manned gas balloons;
**other gases have included [[ammonia]] and [[methane]], but these have poor lifting capacity and other safety defects and have never been widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/lift.html
| title = Balloon Lift with Lighter than Air Gases: Methane
| publisher=UH Manoa Chemistry Department
| accessdate = 2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Rozière balloon|Rozière]]'' type has both heated and unheated lifting gases in separate gasbags. This type of balloon is sometimes used for long-distance record flights, such as the [[Circumnavigation#Notable aerial circumnavigations|recent circumnavigations]], but is not otherwise in use.

Both the hot air, or Montgolfière, balloon and the gas balloon are still in common use. Montgolfière balloons are relatively inexpensive, as they do not require high-grade materials for their envelopes, and they are popular for balloonist sport activity.

===Hot air balloons===
{{main|Hot air balloon}}
[[File:Luftballong.jpg|right|thumb|Hot air balloons, San Diego]]
[[File:Ballon.ogv|thumb|Hot air balloon taking off]]

The first balloon which carried passengers used hot air to obtain buoyancy and was built by the brothers [[Montgolfier brothers|Josef and Etienne Montgolfier]] in [[Annonay]], France in 1783: the first passenger flight was 19 September 1783, carrying a sheep, a duck, and a rooster.

The first tethered manned balloon flight was by a larger Montgolfier balloon, probably on 15 October 1783.  The first free balloon flight was by the same Montgolfier balloon on 21 November 1783.

When heated, air expands, so a given volume of space contains less air. This makes it lighter and, if its lifting power is greater than the weight of the balloon containing it, it will lift the balloon upwards. A hot air balloon can only stay up while it has fuel for its burner, to keep the air hot enough.

The Montgolfiers' early hot air balloons used a solid-fuel brazier which proved less practical than the hydrogen balloons that had followed almost immediately, and hot air ballooning soon died out.

In the 1950s, the convenience and low cost of bottled gas burners led to a revival of hot air ballooning for sport and leisure.

The height or altitude of a hot air balloon is controlled by turning the burner up or down as needed, unlike a gas balloon where ballast weights are often carried so that they can be dropped if the balloon gets too low, and in order to land some lifting gas must be vented through a valve.

===Gas balloons===
{{main|Gas balloon}}
A man-carrying balloon using the light gas hydrogen for buoyancy was made by Professor [[Jacques Charles]] and flown less than a month after the Montgolfier flight, on 1 December 1783. Gas balloons have greater [[lift (force)|lift]] for a given volume, so they do not need to be so large, and they can also stay up for much longer than hot air, so gas balloons dominated ballooning for the next 200 years. In the 19th century, it was common to use [[town gas]] to fill balloons; this was not as light as pure hydrogen gas, having about half the lifting power, but it was much cheaper and readily available.

[[File:GasballoonsABQ.jpg|thumb|left|Gas balloons at the [[Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta]]]]
Light gas balloons are predominant in scientific applications, as they are capable of reaching much higher altitudes for much longer periods of time. They are generally filled with helium. Although hydrogen has more lifting power, it is explosive in an atmosphere rich in [[oxygen]]. With a few exceptions, scientific balloon missions are unmanned.

There are two types of light-gas balloons: zero-pressure and superpressure. Zero-pressure balloons are the traditional form of light-gas balloon. They are partially inflated with the light gas before launch, with the gas pressure the same both inside and outside the balloon. As the zero-pressure balloon rises, its gas expands to maintain the zero pressure difference, and the balloon's envelope swells.

At night, the gas in a zero-pressure balloon cools and contracts, causing the balloon to sink. A zero-pressure balloon can only maintain altitude by releasing gas when it goes too high, where the expanding gas can threaten to rupture the envelope, or releasing ballast when it sinks too low. Loss of gas and ballast limits the endurance of zero-pressure balloons to a few days.

A [[superpressure balloon]], in contrast, has a tough and inelastic envelope that is filled with light gas to pressure higher than that of the external atmosphere, and then sealed. The superpressure balloon cannot change size greatly, and so maintains a generally constant volume. The superpressure balloon maintains an altitude of constant density in the atmosphere, and can maintain flight until gas leakage gradually brings it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Successful_Flight_Of_NASA_Prototype_Super_Pressure_Balloon_In_Antarctica_999.html |title=Successful Flight Of NASA Prototype Super-Pressure Balloon In Antarctica |publisher=Space-travel.com |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Superpressure balloons offer flight endurance of months, rather than days. In fact, in typical operation an Earth-based superpressure balloon mission is ended by a command from ground control to open the envelope, rather than by natural leakage of gas.

[[High-altitude balloon]]s are used as high flying vessels to carry scientific instruments (like [[weather balloon]]s), or reach near-space altitudes to take footage or photos of the earth. These balloons can fly over 100,000 feet (30.5&amp;nbsp;km) into the air, and are designed to burst at a set altitude where the parachute will deploy to safely carry the payload back to earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Von Glahn|first=Rick|title=What we Do|url=http://www.eoss.org/pubs/eossinfo.htm#2|work=Edge of Space Sciences|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cluster ballooning]] uses many smaller gas-filled balloons for flight (see [http://www.clusterballoon.org/intro/intro.html An Introduction to Cluster Ballooning]).

===Combination balloons===
Early hot air balloons could not stay up for very long because they used a lot of fuel, while early hydrogen balloons were difficult to take higher or lower as desired because the aeronaut could only vent the gas or drop off ballast a limited number of times. [[Pilâtre de Rozier]] realised that for a long-distance flight such as crossing the  [[English Channel]], the aeronaut would need to make use of the differing wind directions at different altitudes. It would be essential therefore to have good control of altitude while still able to stay up for a long time. He developed a combination balloon having two gas bags, the [[Rozier balloon]]. The upper one held hydrogen and provided most of the steady lift. The lower one held hot air and could be quickly heated or cooled to provide the varying lift for good altitude control.

In 1785 Pilâtre de Rozier took off in an attempt to fly across the Channel, but shortly into the flight the hydrogen gas bag caught fire and de Rozier did not survive the ensuing accident. This earned de Rozier the title "The First to Fly and the First to Die".

It wasn't until the 1980s that technology was developed to allow safe operation of the Rozier type, for example by using non-flammable helium as the lifting gas, and several designs have successfully undertaken long-distance flights.

===Tethering and kite balloons===
{{main|Kite balloon}}

As an alternative to free flight, a balloon may be [[Tethered balloon|tethered]] to allow reliable take off and landing at the same location. Some of the earliest balloon flights were tethered for safety, and since then balloons have been tethered for many purposes, including military observation and aerial barrage, meteorological and commercial uses.

The natural spherical shape of a balloon is unstable in high winds. Tethered balloons for use in windy conditions are often stabilised by aerodynamic shaping and connecting to the tether by a halter arrangement. These are called [[kite balloon]]s.

A kite balloon is distinct from a [[kytoon]], which obtains a portion of its lift aerodynamically.

Unmanned hot air balloons are popular in Chinese history. [[Zhuge Liang]] of the [[Shu Han]] kingdom, in the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (220–280 AD) used airborne lanterns for military signaling. These lanterns are known as [[Kongming lantern]]s (孔明灯).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ssO_19TRQ9AC&amp;pg=PA113 Ancient Chinese Inventions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/23062/balloon.html The Ten Thousand Infallible Arts of the Prince of Huai-Nan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105935/http://library.thinkquest.org/23062/balloon.html |date=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongolian army studied [[Kongming lantern]]s from Chinese and used it in  [[Battle of Legnica]] during Mongol invasion of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham (1965).

Taipei: Caves Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first time balloon was known by western world.
In 1709 the Portuguese cleric [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão]] made a balloon filled with heated air rise inside a room in [[Lisbon]]. He is also claimed to have built a balloon named ''{{lang|pt|Passarola}}'' (''Big bird'') and attempted to lift himself from Saint George Castle in Lisbon, landing about one kilometre away.&lt;ref&gt;AMEIDA, L.

===The first modern balloons===
[[File:Montgolfier Balloon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A model of the [[Montgolfier brothers]] balloon at the [[London Science Museum]]]]
Following [[Henry Cavendish]]'s 1766 work on [[hydrogen]], [[Joseph Black]] proposed that a balloon filled with hydrogen would be able to rise in the air.

The first recorded manned flight was made in a hot air balloon built by the [[Montgolfier brothers]] on 21 November 1783.&lt;ref name = FAI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 1 December 1783, Professor [[Jacques Charles]] and the [[Robert brothers]] made the first gas balloon flight, also from Paris. Their [[Robert brothers#First manned hydrogen balloon flight|hydrogen-filled balloon]] flew to almost &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;2,000&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;(600&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/span&gt;, stayed aloft for over 2 hours and covered a distance of &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;27&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(43&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt;, landing in the small town of [[Nesles-la-Vallée]].

The first Italian balloon ascent was made by Count [[Paolo Andreani]] and two other passengers in a balloon designed and constructed by the three Gerli brothers, on 25 February 1784.  A public demonstration occurred in [[Brugherio]] a few days later, on 13 March 1784, when the vehicle flew to a height of 1,537 metres (5,043&amp;nbsp;ft) and a distance of 8 kilometres (5.0&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerostati.it/andreani.htm"Grandi personaggi Paolo Andreani (1763–1823)",  Aerostati.it  On line (in Italian).]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 March Andreani received a standing ovation at [[La Scala]], and later a medal from [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]].

De Rozier, together with [[Joseph Proust]], took part in a further flight on 23 June 1784, in a modified version of the Montgolfiers' first balloon christened La [[Marie-Antoinette]] after the Queen. They took off in front of the King of France and King [[Gustav III]] of Sweden. The balloon flew north at an altitude of approximately 3,000 metres, above the clouds, travelling 52&amp;nbsp;km in 45 minutes before cold and turbulence forced them to descend past [[Luzarches]], between [[Coye]] et [[Orry-la-Ville]], near the Chantilly forest.

The first balloon ascent in Britain was made by [[James Tytler]] on 25 August 1784 at [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, in a [[hot air balloon]].

The first aircraft disaster occurred in May 1785 when the town of [[Tullamore]], [[County Offaly]], Ireland was seriously damaged when the crash of a balloon resulted in a fire that burned down about 100 houses, making the town home to the world's first [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation disaster]]. To this day, the town shield depicts a [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] rising from the ashes.

[[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] went on to make the first manned flight of a balloon in America on 9 January 1793, after touring Europe to set the record for the first balloon flight in countries including the [[Austrian Netherlands]], Germany, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Poland]]. His hydrogen filled balloon took off from a prison yard in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. The flight reached &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;5,800&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;(1,770&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/span&gt; and landed in [[Gloucester County, New Jersey]]. President [[George Washington]] was among the guests observing the takeoff.

On 29 September 1804, Abraham Hopman became the first Dutchman to make a successful balloon flight in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Nabben | first=Han | year=2011 | publisher=BDU Boeken | location=Barneveld, Netherlands | isbn=978-90-8788-151-1 | title=Lichter dan Lucht, los van de aarde | url=http://ballonboek.nl | accessdate=2011-11-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904062620/http://www.ballonboek.nl/ | archivedate=4 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas balloons became the most common type from the 1790s until the 1960s. The French military [[observation balloon]] ''[[L'Intrépide]]'' of 1795 is the oldest preserved aircraft in Europe; it is on display in the ''[[Heeresgeschichtliches Museum]]'' in Vienna. [[Jules Verne]] wrote a short, non-fiction story, published in 1852, about being stranded aboard a hydrogen balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manybooks.net/titles/vernejul16081608516085-8.html |title=A Voyage in a Balloon by Jules Verne – Free eBook |publisher=Manybooks.net |date=2005-06-18 |accessdate=2011-06-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723203520/http://www.manybooks.net/titles/vernejul16081608516085-8.html| archivedate= 23 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest successful balloon flight recorded in Australia was by William Dean in 1858. His balloon was gas-filled and travelled 30&amp;nbsp;km with two people aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dreamers, experimenters and balloonists|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/aviation/dreamers/index.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 January, 1870, T. Gale, made an ascent from the Domain in Sydney. His balloon was 17 metres in length by 31 metres in circumference and his ascent, with him seated on the netting, took him about a mile before he landed in Glebe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63619918 GALE'S BALLOON ASCENT].

[[Henri Giffard]] also developed a tethered balloon for passengers in 1878 in the [[Tuileries Garden]] in Paris. The first tethered balloon in modern times was made in France at Chantilly Castle in 1994 by [[Aerophile SA]].

===Military use===
{{Main|History of military ballooning}}
{{See also|Observation balloon}}
The first military use of a balloon was at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] in 1794, when ''L'Entreprenant'' was used by the [[French Aerostatic Corps]] to watch the movements of the enemy. On 2 April 1794, an aeronauts corps was created in the French army; however, given the logistical problems linked with the production of hydrogen on the battlefield (it required constructing ovens and pouring water on white-hot iron), the corps was disbanded in 1799.

The first major use of balloons in the military occurred during the [[American Civil War]] with the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]] established in 1861.

[[File:World War I Observation Balloon HD-SN-99-02269.JPEG|thumb|upright|right|Close-up view of an American major in the basket of an [[observation balloon]] flying over territory near front lines during World War I.]]

During the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864–70), observation balloons were used by the [[Brazilian Army]].

Balloons were used by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Royal Engineers]] in 1885 for reconnaissance and observation purposes during the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland Expedition]] and the [[Nile Expedition|Sudan Expedition]]. Although experiments in Britain had been conducted as early as 1863, a [[School of Ballooning]] was not established at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham, Medway, Kent]] until 1888. During the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]] (1899–1902), use was made of observation balloons. A {{convert|11500|ft3}} balloon was kept inflated for 22 days and marched 165 miles into the Transvaal with the British forces.&lt;ref name="Bruce-8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Eric Stuart|title=Aircraft in war|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=London|year=1914|page=8|url=https://archive.org/stream/aircraftinwar00brucuoft#page/8/mode/1up|accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen-filled balloons were widely used during [[World War I]] (1914–1918) to detect enemy troop movements and to direct artillery fire. Observers phoned their reports to officers on the ground who then relayed the information to those who needed it. Balloons were frequently targets of opposing aircraft. Planes assigned to attack enemy balloons were often equipped with [[incendiary bullet]]s, for the purpose of igniting the hydrogen.

The [[Aeronaut Badge]] was established by the [[United States Army]] in World War I to denote service members who were qualified balloon pilots. Observation balloons were retained well after the Great War, being used in the Russo-Finnish Wars, the [[Winter War]] of 1939–40, and the [[Continuation War]] of 1941–45.

During [[World War II]] the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] launched thousands of hydrogen "[[fire balloon]]s" against the United States and Canada. In [[Operation Outward]] the British used balloons to carry incendiaries to [[Nazi Germany]]. During 2018, [[Incendiary balloon]]s and [[incendiary kite|kites]] were launched from Gaza at Israel, burning some 12,000 dunams (3,000 acres) in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5305847,00.html IN PHOTOS: Damages caused by the Gaza fire terrorism], YNET, 7 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Large helium balloons [[Balloon campaigns in Korea|are used by the South Korean government]] and private activists advocating freedom in [[North Korea]]. They float hundreds of kilometers across the border carrying news from the outside world, illegal radios, foreign currency and gifts of personal hygiene supplies. A North Korean military official has described it as "psychological warfare" and threatened to attack South Korea if their release continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20180-balloon-launches-breach-north-koreas-bubble.html |title=Balloon launches breach North Korea's bubble – science-in-society – 01 March 2011 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-05-31/world/south.korea.message_1_north-koreans-defectors-south-korean-warship |title=Helium balloons float propaganda into North Korea |publisher=CNN  |date=2010-05-31 |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hot air returns===
[[Ed Yost]] redesigned the hot air balloon in the late 1950s using rip-stop nylon fabrics and high-powered [[propane]] burners to create the modern hot air balloon. His first flight of such a balloon, lasting 25 minutes and covering &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;3&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(5&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt;, occurred on 22 October 1960 in [[Bruning, Nebraska]]. Yost's improved design for hot air balloons triggered the modern sport balloon movement. Today, hot air balloons are much more common than gas balloons.

In the late 1970s the British hot air balloonist [[Julian Nott (balloonist)|Julian Nott]] constructed a hot air balloon using technologies he believed would have been available to the [[Nazca culture]] of [[Peru]] some 1500 to 2000 years earlier, and demonstrated that it could fly.&lt;ref name=Nott&gt;{{cite web

Tethered gas balloons have been installed as [[List of amusement rides|amusement rides]] in Paris since 1999, in Berlin since 2000, in [[Disneyland Paris]] since 2005, in the San Diego Wild Animal Park since 2005, in [[Walt Disney World]] in Orlando since 2009, and the [[DHL Balloon]] in Singapore in 2006. Modern tethered gas balloons are made by [[Aerophile SAS]].

Hot air balloons used in sport flying are sometimes made in special designs to advertise a company or product, such as the Chubb [[fire extinguisher]] illustrated.

===Astronautics===

====Balloon satellites====
{{main|Balloon satellite}}

A balloon in space uses internal gas pressure only to maintain its shape.

The [[Echo satellite]] was a [[balloon satellite]] launched into Earth orbit in 1960 and used for passive relay of radio communication. [[PAGEOS]] was launched in 1966 for worldwide satellite triangulation, allowing for greater precision in the calculation of different locations on the planet's surface.

On 27 May 1931, [[Auguste Piccard]] and Paul Kipfer became the first to reach the [[stratosphere]] in a balloon.&lt;ref&gt;Tripod&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Abruzzo was the first man to cross the Pacific Ocean in a hot air balloon.

On 31 August 1933, [[Alexander Dahl]] took the first picture of the Earth's curvature in an open hydrogen gas balloon.

The helium-filled [[Stratobowl|''Explorer II'']] balloon, piloted by [[US Army Air Corps]] officers Capt. Orvil A. Anderson, Maj. William E. Kepner and Capt. Albert W. Stevens, reached a new record height of 22,066 m (72,395&amp;nbsp;ft) on 11 November 1935. This followed the same crew's previous near-fatal plunge in July 1934 in a predecessor craft, ''Explorer'', after its canopy ruptured just 190&amp;nbsp;m (624&amp;nbsp;ft) short (it transpired) of the then-current altitude record of 22,000 m (72,178&amp;nbsp;ft) set by the Soviet balloon ''[[Osoaviakhim-1]]''.

In 1976, [[Ed Yost]] set 13 aviation world’s records for distance traveled and amount of time aloft in his attempt to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] —solo— by balloon (3.938&amp;nbsp;km, 107:37 h).

The current absolute altitude record for manned balloon flight was set at 34,668 m (113,739&amp;nbsp;ft) on 4 May 1961 by [[Malcolm Ross (balloonist)|Malcolm Ross]] and [[Victor Prather]] in the [[Project Strato-Lab|Strato-Lab V]] balloon payload launched from the deck of the [[USS Antietam (CV-36)|USS ''Antietam'']] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].{{efn|name=FAIAbsoluteAltitute|The 4 May 1961 FAI Absolute Altitude (#2325) record for balloon flight set by [[Malcolm Ross (balloonist)|Malcolm Ross]] and [[Victor Prather]] is still current, as it requires the balloonist to descend with the balloon.

On 1 March 1999 [[Bertrand Piccard]] and [[Brian Jones (aeronaut)|Brian Jones]] set off in the [[balloon]] [[Breitling Orbiter|Breitling Orbiter 3]] from [[Château d'Oex]] in Switzerland on the first non-stop balloon [[circumnavigation]] around the globe. They landed in [[Egypt]] after a 40,814&amp;nbsp;km (25,361&amp;nbsp;mi) flight lasting 19 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes.
 
The altitude record for an unmanned balloon is 53.0 kilometres (173,882&amp;nbsp;ft), reached with a volume of 60,000 cubic metres. The balloon was launched by [[JAXA]] on 25 May 2002 from [[Iwate Prefecture]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/special/2003/yamagami/ |title=Research on Balloons to Float Over 50km Altitude |publisher=Isas.jaxa.jp |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the greatest height ever obtained by an atmospheric vehicle. Only [[rocket]]s, [[rocket plane]]s, and [[ballistics|ballistic]] projectiles have flown higher.

In 2015, the two pilots Leonid Tiukhtyaev and Troy Bradley arrived safely in [[Baja California]], Mexico after a journey of 10,711&amp;nbsp;km. The two men, originally from Russia and the United States of America respectively, started in Japan and flew with a helium balloon over the Pacific. In 160 hours, the balloon named "Two Eagles" arrived in Mexico, which is new distance and duration records for straight gas balloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Botelho |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/31/world/transpacific-balloon-flight/ |title=Research on Balloons to Float Over 50km Altitude |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
John Ingram is a very successful oil-field firefighter and a family man.  All is going so well, he's even bought his own oil well in hope of striking it rich.  His greatest fears are realized, however, when a man, William Ramey, from his secret past sees Ingram in a newsreel and shows up looking for a job.

Ramey attempts to blackmail Ingram, who had run from a chain gang years ago and started a new life under an assumed name.  After a shady deal is made, Ingram is tricked and Ramey turns him into authorities, who return him to a chain gang.  Ramey subsequently becomes a very rich man.

When Ingram finds out about the success of the man who betrayed him, he plans a daring escape in an attempt to return home and get revenge.

'''''Building Safer Communities. Risk Governance, Spatial Planning and Responses to Natural Hazards''''' is a 2009 book edited by Urbano Fra Paleo, published by [[IOS Press]].

This textbook examines the central principles of enhanced [[risk governance]], whose implementation might help to mitigate the increasing losses caused by [[natural hazards]]. It promotes the adoption of [[proactive]], preventive approaches in [[public policies]], particularly through [[land use planning]], by influencing on the occupation of hazard-prone areas.
It serves both as a comprehensive introduction to the formulation and implementation at the strategic level of policies that address [[risk]], and as an advancement in the integration of current practices, including [[emergency management]], [[environmental management]], [[community development]] and [[spatial planning]]. 
The authors study and construe solutions that review integrated strategies of the various levels of government considering:
* The central role of [[local government]] in planning for [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]],
* The integration of mitigation with other social, economic and environmental goals,
* The engagement of all [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in mitigation planning,
* The avoidance of disruption of [[Natural environment|environmental]] functions,
* The need of integrating mandates of higher level government with cooperative planning in order to both secure local government participation and make planning [[sustainable]],
* [[Participatory decision-making]] processes need to be improved by differentiating among their types and applications, in order to effectively respond in [[risk management]],
* People [[perception]] of and response to risk must be part of the planning process,
* Processes of human exposure to natural hazards should be fully understood in order to prevent further exposure,
* The [[precautionary principle]] needs to be integrated in risk management, although under comprehensible [[regulation]] in order to promote action,
* Urban risk governance can only be understood within the framework of regional and biophysical systems,
* [[Social impact assessment]] is a tool that helps to better identify the social and [[community]] dimensions of risk,
* Planning should be considered more as a process than as a result, and
* Post-[[disaster]] recovery also provides opportunities for mitigation and community improvement.&lt;ref name=auth&gt;[http://www.iospress.nl/loadtop/load.php?isbn=9781607500469  Building Safer Communities.

Canna [[Canna (plant)|achira]] and Canna [[Canna (plant)|edulis]] (Latin: eatable) are generic terms used in South America to describe the cannas that have been selectively bred for agricultural purposes, normally derived from [[Canna discolor|C. ''discolor'']].&lt;ref name=Tanaka2&gt;[[Nobuyuki Tanaka|Tanaka, N.]] 2001.

[[Image:Canna Edulis 2003072001 0014.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''Canna'' (Agriculture Group) 'Edulis Dark']]
Many more traditional varieties exist worldwide, they have all involved human selection and so are classified as agricultural cultivars. Folk lore states that [[Canna indica|''Canna edulis'' Ker-Gawl.]] is the variety grown for food in South America, but there is no scientific evidence to substantiate the name as a separate species. It is probable that this is simply a synonym of C. ''discolor'', which is grown for agricultural purposes throughout South America and Asia.&lt;ref name=Tanaka2/&gt; 

In the Andes, the rhizome can be harvested within 6 months from planting out and the yields range from 13 - 85 tonnes per hectare, with 22 - 50 tonnes being average, though larger yields are obtained after 8 – 10 months. In Queensland, Australia they are able to obtain a yield of 5-10 tons of C. 'Queensland Arrowroot' tubers per acre.&lt;ref name=Arrowroot&gt;[http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/MV009 Arrowroot, James M. Stephens, University of Florida]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cultivated forms do not produce fertile seed. There are also sterile triploid forms, these contain a significantly higher proportion of starch, though their cropping potential is not known.&lt;ref name=Khoshoo&gt;Khoshoo, T.N. &amp; Guha, I. - Origin and Evolution of Cultivated Cannas.

==Animal fodder==
The rhizomes and leaves are good [[fodder]] for cattle and pigs and it is grown for this purpose in Tropical Africa and [[Hawaii]], where it is harvested 4–8 months after planting.&lt;ref name=Kew&gt;[https://archive.is/20130223095849/http://www.aluka.org/action/showMetadata?doi=10.5555/AL.AP.UPWTA.1_615&amp;pgs=&amp;cookieSet=1 Burkill, H.M. 1985.

==Human consumption==
Canna is still grown for human consumption in the [[Andes]] and also in [[Vietnam]] and southern [[China]], where the starch is used to make [[cellophane noodles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cipotato.org/market/PgmRprts/pr97-98/50canna.pdf Reappraisal of Edible Canna as a High-Value Starch Crop in Vietnam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117191611/http://www.cipotato.org/market/PgmRprts/pr97-98/50canna.pdf |date=2006-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanaka3&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ffcr.or.jp/zaidan/FFCRHOME.nsf/7bd44c20b0dc562649256502001b65e9/cb71f616e311cc9549257177000afed8/$FILE/211(4)4.pdf |title=Nobuyuki Tanaka, Naoyoshi Inouch, and Tetsuo Koyama.

'''Rootstock''' - actually a rhizome, this can be eaten either raw or cooked. It is the source of ''canna starch'' which is used as a substitute for [[arrowroot]]. The starch is obtained by rasping the rhizome to a pulp, then washing and straining to get rid of the fibres. This starch is very digestible. The very young rhizomes can also be eaten cooked, they are sweet but fibrous. The rhizome can be very large, sometimes as long as a person's forearm. In Peru the rhizomes are baked for up to 12 hours by which time they become a white, translucent, fibrous and somewhat mucilaginous mass with a sweetish taste. The starch is in very large grains, about three times the size of [[potato starch]] grains, and can be seen with the naked eye. This starch is easily separated from the fibre of the rhizome.

'''Young shoots''' - these can be cooked and eaten as a green vegetable and are quite nutritious, containing at least 10% protein.&lt;ref name=Future1&gt;[http://www.pfaf.org/database/plants.php?Canna+edulis Plants for a Future - Canna Edulis]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7287">In [[electronics]], '''cathode bias''' (also known as self-bias, or automatic bias) is a technique used with [[vacuum tube]]s to make the direct current (dc) cathode voltage positive in relation to the negative side of the plate voltage supply by an amount equal to the magnitude of the desired [[grid bias]] voltage.&lt;ref name="Cruft"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n303 Cruft Electronics Staff, ''Electronic Circuits and Tubes'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1947, pp. 280-281, 334-336]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The most common cathode bias implementation passes the cathode current through a resistor connected between the cathode and the negative side of the plate voltage supply.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/RadioPhysicsCourseGhirardi/Radio%20Physics%20Course%20-%20Ghirardi#page/n491 Ghirardi, Alfred A. (1932). Radio Physics Course (2nd ed.). New York: Rinehart Books. p. 480]&lt;/ref&gt; The cathode current through this resistor causes the desired voltage drop across the resistor and places the cathode at a positive dc voltage equal in magnitude to the negative grid bias voltage required. The grid circuit puts the grid at zero volts dc relative to negative side of the plate voltage supply, causing the grid voltage to be negative with respect to the cathode by the required amount.&lt;ref name="Orr_1962"/&gt; Directly heated cathode circuits connect the cathode bias resistor to the center tap of the filament transformer secondary or to the center tap of a low resistance connected across the filament.&lt;ref name="Ghirardi_1932"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/RadioPhysicsCourseGhirardi/Radio%20Physics%20Course%20-%20Ghirardi#page/n485 Ghirardi, Alfred A. (1932). Radio Physics Course (2nd ed.). New York: Rinehart Books. p. 475]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
To find the correct resistor value, first the tube operating point is determined. The plate current, the grid voltage relative to the cathode and the screen current (if applicable) are noted for the operating point. The cathode bias resistor value is found by dividing the absolute value of the operating point grid voltage by the operating point cathode current (plate current plus screen current).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/RadioPhysicsCourseGhirardi/Radio%20Physics%20Course%20-%20Ghirardi#page/n487 Ghirardi (1932) p. 476]&lt;/ref&gt; The power dissipated by the cathode bias resistor is the product of the square of the cathode current and the resistance in ohms.

Any signal frequency effect of the cathode resistor may be minimized by providing a suitable capacitor in parallel with the resistor. In general, the capacitor value is selected such that the time constant of the capacitor and bias resistor is an order of magnitude greater than the period of the lowest frequency to be amplified. The capacitor makes the gain of the stage, at the signal frequencies, essentially the same as if the cathode was connected directly to the circuit return.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n357 Cruft Electronics Staff, ''Electronic Circuits and Tubes'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1947, p. 335]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some designs, the degenerative (negative) feedback caused by the cathode resistor may be desirable. In this case, all or a portion of the cathode resistance is not bypassed by a capacitor.&lt;ref name="Veley_1994"/&gt;

In class A push-pull circuits a pair of tubes driven by identical signals 180 degrees out of phase may share a common unbypassed cathode resistor. Degeneration will not occur because, if the grid voltage versus plate current characteristics of the two tubes are matched, the current through the cathode resistor will not vary during the 360 degrees of the signal cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/RadioPhysicsCourseGhirardi/Radio%20Physics%20Course%20-%20Ghirardi#page/n681 Ghirardi (1932) p. 670]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application considerations==
* The voltage gain of the stage is reduced by the cathode resistor. The cathode resistor appears in series with the plate load impedance in the voltage gain equation.&lt;ref name="Veley_1994"/&gt;
* Local negative feedback (''cathode degeneration'') is caused by the cathode resistor.&lt;ref name="Veley_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n437 Cruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 416]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "B" or plate supply voltage available to the tube is, in effect, reduced by the magnitude of the bias voltage.&lt;ref name="Ghirardi_1932"/&gt;

==Comparison with fixed bias==
Cathode bias, as a solution, is often the alternative to using [[fixed bias]].&lt;ref name="Tomer_1960"/&gt; Robert Tomer, in his 1960 book about vacuum tubes, which mainly concerned itself with strategies for improving tube lifespan, condemned fixed bias designs in favor of cathode bias. He said that fixed bias, unlike cathode bias, does not provide a margin for error that protects the system from inevitable differences between vacuum tubes nor does it protect against run-away conditions caused by tube or circuit malfunctions.&lt;ref name="Tomer_1960"/&gt; He also asserted that most tube specialists consider fixed bias operation to be dangerous.&lt;ref name="Tomer_1960"/&gt; Despite this stance, fixed bias is commonly used in tube amplifiers today. Tomer identified the trend toward fixed bias designs in 1960 but was not certain about the reasons for it.&lt;ref name="Tomer_1960"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30925">'''Combinatorial chemistry''' comprises [[chemical synthesis|chemical synthetic methods]] that make it possible to prepare a large number (tens to thousands or even millions) of compounds in a single process. These [[compound library|compound libraries]] can be made as mixtures, sets of individual compounds or chemical structures generated by computer software.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Combinatorial chemistry can be used for the synthesis of small molecules and for peptides.

Strategies that allow identification of useful components of the libraries are also part of combinatorial chemistry. The methods used in combinatorial chemistry are applied outside chemistry, too.

==Introduction==
Synthesis of molecules in a [[combinatorial]] fashion can quickly lead to large numbers of molecules.  For example, a molecule with three points of diversity (''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can generate &lt;math&gt;N_{R_1} \times N_{R_2} \times N_{R_3}&lt;/math&gt; possible structures, where &lt;math&gt;N_{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;N_{R_3}&lt;/math&gt; are the numbers of different substituents utilized. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare [[compound library|libraries]] of very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries.

Although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at [[Rockefeller University]], [[Bruce Merrifield]], started investigating the [[solid-phase synthesis]] of [[peptide]]s.

In its modern form, combinatorial chemistry has probably had its biggest impact in the [[pharmaceutical]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/tcaw/11/i01/html/01lesney.html|title=Concocting combinatorials: Chemistry in drug development|last=Lesney|first=Mark S.|date=2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers attempting to optimize the activity profile of a compound create a '[[chemical library|library]]' of many different but related compounds. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Advances in [[robotics]] have led to an industrial approach to combinatorial synthesis, enabling companies to routinely produce over 100,000 new and unique compounds per year.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In order to handle the vast number of structural possibilities, researchers often create a 'virtual library', a computational enumeration of all possible structures of a given [[pharmacophore]] with all available [[reactant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;E. V.Gordeeva et al. "COMPASS program - an original semi-empirical approach to computer-assisted synthesis" [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0040-4020(01)92270-7 Tetrahedron, 48 (1992) 3789].&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a library can consist of thousands to millions of 'virtual' compounds.  The researcher will select a subset of the 'virtual library' for actual synthesis, based upon various calculations and criteria (see [[ADME]], [[computational chemistry]], and [[Quantitative structure–activity relationship|QSAR]]).

==Combinatorial synthesis – peptides==
[[File:Cycle 3,4 vágott.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Peptides forming in cycles 3 and 4]]
The combinatorial "split-mix synthesis"&lt;ref&gt;Á. Furka, F. Sebestyen, M. Asgedom, G. Dibo, General method for rapid synthesis of multicomponent peptide mixtures. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 1991, 37, 487-493.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the [[solid phase synthesis]] developed by Merrifield.&lt;ref&gt;Merrifield RB, 1963 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85, 2149.&lt;/ref&gt; If a combinatorial peptide library is synthesized using 20 [[amino acid]]s (or other kinds of building blocks) the bead form solid support is divided into 20 equal portions. This is followed by coupling a different amino acid to each portion. The third step is mixing of all portions. These three steps comprise a cycle. Elongation of the peptide chains can be realized by simply repeating the steps of the cycle.
[[File:Split-mix synthesis.jpg|thumb|left |200px|Flow diagram of the split-mix combinatorial synthesis]]

The procedure is illustrated by the synthesis of a dipeptide library using the same three amino acids as building blocks in both cycles. Each component of this library contains two amino acids arranged in different orders. The amino acids used in couplings are represented by yellow, blue and red circles in the figure. Divergent arrows show dividing solid support resin (green circles) into equal portions, vertical arrows mean coupling and convergent arrows represent mixing and homogenizing the portions of the support.

The figure shows that in the two synthetic cycles 9 dipeptides are formed. In a third and fourth cycles 27 tripeptides and 81 tetrapeptides would form, respectively.

The "split-mix synthesis" has several outstanding features:

* It is highly efficient. As the figure demonstrates the number of peptides formed in the synthetic process (3, 9, 27, 81) increases exponentially with the number of executed cycles. Using 20 amino acids in each synthetic cycle the number of formed peptides are: 400, 8,000, 160,000 and 3,200,000, respectively. This means that the number of peptides increases exponentially with the number of the executed cycles.
* All peptide sequences are formed in the process that can be deduced by combination of the amino acids used in the cycles.
* Portioning of the support into equal samples assures formation of the components of the library in nearly equal molar quantities.
* Only a single peptide forms on each bead of the support. This is the consequence of using only one amino acid in the coupling steps. It is completely unknown, however, which is the peptide that occupies a selected bead.
* The split-mix method can be used for the synthesis of organic or any other kind of library that can be prepared from its building blocks in a stepwise process.

In 1990 three groups described methods for preparing peptide libraries by biological methods&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Scott and G. P. Smith Science 1990, 249, 404.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Cwirla, E. A. Peters, R. W. Barrett and W. J. Dower Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1990, 87, 6378.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Devlin, L. C. Panganiban and P. E. Devlin Science 1990, 249, 404.&lt;/ref&gt; and one year later Fodor et al. published a remarkable method for synthesis of peptide arrays on small glass slides.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor SP, Read JL, Pirrung MC, Stryer L, Lu AT, Solas D, 1991. Light-directed, spatially addressable parallel chemical synthesis. ''Science'' 251, 767-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "parallel synthesis" method was developed by Mario Geysen and his colleagues for preparation of peptide arrays.&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Geysen, R. H. Meloen, S. J. Barteling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1984, 81, 3998.&lt;/ref&gt; They synthesized 96 peptides on plastic rods (pins) coated at their ends with the solid support. The pins were immersed into the solution of reagents placed in the wells of a [[microtiter plate]]. The method is widely applied particularly by using automatic parallel synthesizers. Although the parallel method is much slower than the real combinatorial one, its advantage is that it is exactly known which peptide or other compound forms on each pin.

Further procedures were developed to combine the advantages of both split-mix and the parallel synthesis. In the method described by two groups&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Moran, S. Sarshar, J. F. Cargill, M. Shahbaz, A Lio, A. M. M. Mjalli, R. W. Armstrong J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 10787.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. C. Nicolaou, X –Y. Xiao, Z. Parandoosh, A. Senyei, M. P. Nova Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 36, 2289.&lt;/ref&gt; the solid support was enclosed into permeable plastic capsules together with a radiofrequency tag that carried the code of the compound to be formed in the capsule. The procedure was carried out similar to the split-mix method. In the split step, however, the capsules were distributed among the reaction vessels according to the codes read from the radiofrequency tags of the capsules.
 
A different method for the same purpose was developed by Furka et al.&lt;ref&gt;Á. Furka, J. W. Christensen, E. Healy, H. R. Tanner, H. Saneii J. Comb. Chem. 2000, 2, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; is named "string synthesis". In this method the capsules carried no code. They are stringed like the pearls in a necklace and placed into the reaction vessels in stringed form. The identity of the capsules, as well as their contents, are stored by their position occupied on the strings. After each coupling step the capsules are redistributed among new strings according to definite rules.

==Combinatorial synthesis – solid-phase==
{{Review|section|date=July 2018}}
In the drug discovery process, the synthesis and biological evaluation of small molecules of interest has typically been a long and laborious process. Combinatorial chemistry has emerged in recent decades as an approach to quickly and efficiently synthesize large numbers of potential
small molecule drug candidates. In a typical synthesis, only a single target molecule is produced at the end of a synthetic scheme, with each step in a synthesis producing only a single product. In a [[combinatorial synthesis]], when using only single starting material, it is possible to synthesize a large library of molecules using identical reaction conditions that can then be screened for their biological activity. This pool of products is then split into three equal portions containing each of the three products, and then each of the three individual pools is then reacted with another unit of reagent B, C, or D, producing 9 unique compounds from the previous 3. This process is then repeated until the desired number of building blocks is added, generating many compounds. When synthesizing a library of compounds by a multi-step synthesis, efficient reaction methods must be employed, and if traditional purification methods are used after each reaction step, yields and efficiency will suffer.

Solid-phase synthesis offers potential solutions to obviate the need for typical quenching and purification steps often used in synthetic chemistry. In general, a starting molecule is adhered to a solid support (typically an [[insoluble polymer]]), then additional reactions are performed, and the final product is purified and then cleaved from the solid support. Since the molecules of interest are attached to a solid support, it is possible to reduce the purification after each reaction to a single filtration/wash step, eliminating the need for tedious liquid-liquid extraction and solvent evaporation steps that most synthetic chemistry involves. Furthermore, by using heterogeneous reactants, excess reagents can be used to drive sluggish reactions to completion, which can further improve yields. Excess reagents can simply be washed away without the need for additional purification steps such as [[chromatography]].

Over the years, a variety of methods have been developed to refine the use of solid-phase organic synthesis in combinatorial chemistry, including efforts to increase the ease of synthesis and purification, as well as non-traditional methods to characterize intermediate products. Although
the majority of the examples described here will employ heterogeneous reaction media in every reaction step, Booth and Hodges provide an early example of using solid-supported reagents only during the purification step of traditional solution-phase syntheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Booth |first=R. John |last2=Hodges |first2=John C. |year=1999-2001 |title=Solid-Supported Reagent Strategies for Rapid Purification of Combinatorial Synthesis Products |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar970311n |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |language=en |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=18–26 |doi=10.1021/ar970311n |issn=0001-4842}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view,
solution-phase chemistry offers the advantages of avoiding attachment and cleavage reactions necessary to anchor and remove molecules to resins as well as eliminating the need to recreate solid-phase analogues of established solution-phase reactions.

The single purification step at the end of a synthesis allows one or more impurities to be removed, assuming the chemical structure of the offending impurity is known. While the use of solid-supported reagents greatly simplifies the synthesis of compounds, many combinatorial syntheses require multiple steps, each of which still requires some form of purification. Armstrong, et al. describe a one-pot method for generating combinatorial libraries, called multiple-component condensations (MCCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Armstrong |first=Robert W. |last2=Combs |first2=Andrew P. |last3=Tempest |first3=Paul A. |last4=Brown |first4=S. David |last5=Keating |first5=Thomas A. |year=1996-2001 |title=Multiple-Component Condensation Strategies for Combinatorial Library Synthesis |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar9502083 |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |language=en |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=123–131 |doi=10.1021/ar9502083 |issn=0001-4842}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this scheme, three or more reagents react such that each reagent is incorporated into the final product in a single step, eliminating the need for a multi-step synthesis that involves many purification steps. In MCCs, there is no deconvolution required to determine which compounds are biologically-active because each synthesis in an array has only a single product, thus the identity of the compound should be unequivocally known.

In another array synthesis, Still generated a large library of [[oligopeptides]] by split synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Still |first=W. Clark |year=1996-2001 |title=Discovery of Sequence-Selective Peptide Binding by Synthetic Receptors Using Encoded Combinatorial Libraries |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar950166i?journalCode=achre4 |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |language=en |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=155–163 |doi=10.1021/ar950166i |issn=0001-4842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawback to making many thousands of compounds is that it is difficult to determine the structure of the formed compounds. Their solution is to use molecular tags, where a tiny amount (1 pmol/bead) of a dye is attached to the beads, and the identity of a certain bead can be determined by analyzing which tags are present on the bead. Despite how easy attaching tags makes identification of receptors, it would be quite impossible to individually screen each compound for its receptor binding ability, so a dye was attached to each receptor, such that only those receptors that bind to their substrate produce a color change.

When many reactions need to be run in an array (such as the 96 reactions described in one of Armstrong's MCC arrays), some of the more tedious aspects of synthesis can be automated to improve efficiency. DeWitt and Czarnik detail a method called the "[[DIVERSOMER method]]," in which many miniaturized versions of chemical reactions are all run simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=DeWitt |first=Sheila Hobbs |last2=Czarnik |first2=Anthony W. |year=1996-2001 |title=Combinatorial Organic Synthesis Using Parke-Davis's DIVERSOMER Method |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar950209v |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |language=en |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=114–122 |doi=10.1021/ar950209v |issn=0001-4842}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method uses a device that automates the resin loading and wash cycles, as well as the reaction cycle monitoring and purification, and demonstrate the feasibility of their method and apparatus by using it to synthesize a variety of molecule classes, such as [[hydantoins]] and [[benzodiazepines]], running 40 individual reactions in most cases.

Oftentimes, it is not possible to use expensive equipment, and Schwabacher, et al. describe a simple method of combining parallel synthesis of library members and evaluation of entire libraries of compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schwabacher |first=Alan W. |last2=Shen |first2=Yixing |last3=Johnson |first3=Christopher W. |year=1999-2009 |title=Fourier Transform Combinatorial Chemistry |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja991452i?journalCode=jacsat |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |language=en |volume=121 |issue=37 |pages=8669–8670 |doi=10.1021/ja991452i |issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their method, a thread that is partitioned into different regions is wrapped around a cylinder, where a different reagent is then coupled to each region which bears only a single species. The thread is then re-divided and wrapped around a cylinder of a different size, and this process is then repeated. The beauty of this method is that the identity of each product can be known simply by its location along the thread, and the corresponding biological activity is identified by [[Fourier transformation of fluorescence signals]].

In most of the syntheses described here, it is necessary to attach and remove the starting reagent to/from a solid support. This can lead to generation of a hydroxyl group, which can potentially affect the biological activity of a target compound. Ellman uses solid phase supports in a multi-step synthesis scheme to obtain 192 individual 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, which are well-known therapeutic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ellman |first=Jonathan A. |year=1996-2001 |title=Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Small-Molecule Libraries |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar950190w |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |language=en |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=132–143 |doi=10.1021/ar950190w |issn=0001-4842}}&lt;/ref&gt; To eliminate the possibility of potential hydroxyl group interference, a novel method using silyl-aryl chemistry is used to link the molecules to the solid support which cleaves from the support and leaves no trace of the linker.

When anchoring a molecule to a solid support, intermediates cannot be isolated from one another without cleaving the molecule from the resin. Since many of the traditional characterization techniques used to track reaction progress and confirm product structure are solution-based,
different techniques must be used. Gel-phase 13 C NMR spectroscopy, MALDI mass spectrometry, and IR spectroscopy have been used to confirm structure and monitor the progress of solid-phase reactions.&lt;ref name=accounts&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gordon |first=E.

The authors demonstrate the use of fast 13 C gel phase NMR spectroscopy and magic angle spinning 1 H NMR spectroscopy to monitor the progress of reactions and showed that most imines could be formed in as little as 10 minutes at room temperature when trimethyl orthoformate was used as the solvent. The formed imines were then derivatized to generate 4-thiazolidinones, B-lactams, and pyrrolidines.

The use of solid-phase supports greatly simplifies the synthesis of large combinatorial libraries of compounds. This is done by anchoring a starting material to a solid support and then running subsequent reactions until a sufficiently large library is built, after which the products are cleaved from the support. The use of solid-phase purification has also been demonstrated for use in solution-phase synthesis schemes in conjunction with standard liquid-liquid extraction purification techniques.

==Deconvolution and screening==
The synthesized molecules of a combinatorial library are 'cleaved' from the solid support and mixed into solution. In such solution, millions of different compounds may be found. When this synthetic method was developed, it first seemed impossible to identify the molecules, and to find molecules with useful properties. Strategies of purification, identification, and screening were developed, however, to solve the problem. All these strategies are based on synthesis and testing of partial libraries.

The earliest strategy, the "Iteration method" is described in the above-mentioned document of Furka notarized in 1982. Identification of the sequence of the active peptide involves removal of samples after each coupling step of the synthesis before mixing. These samples are used in the step-by-step identification by testing and coupling starting at the [[N-terminus]].

The "Positional scanning" method&lt;ref&gt;Á. Furka, F. Sebestyén WO 93/24517.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on synthesis and testing of a series of sub-libraries in which a certain sequence position in all components is occupied by the same amino acid.

"Omission libraries"&lt;ref&gt;T. Carell, E. A. Winter, J. Rebek Jr. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994, 33, 2061.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Câmpian, M. Peterson, H. H. Saneii, Á. Furka Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Letters 1998, 8, 2357.&lt;/ref&gt;  in which a certain amino acid is missing from all peptides of the mixture as well as "amino acid tester libraries"&lt;ref&gt;E. Câmpian, J. Chou, M. L. Peterson, H. H. Saneii, Á. Furka, R. Ramage, R. Epton (Eds) In Peptides 1996, 1998, Mayflower Scientific Ltd. England, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; that contain those peptides that are missing from the omission libraries can also be used in the deconvolution process.

If the peptides are not cleaved from the solid support we deal with a mixture of beads, each bead containing a single peptide. Smith and his colleagues&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Smith J. G. R. Hurrel, S. J. Leach Immunochemistry 1977, 14, 565.&lt;/ref&gt; showed earlier that peptides could be tested in tethered form, too. This approach was also used in screening peptide libraries.&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Lam, S. E. Salmon, E. M. Hersh, V. J. Hruby, W. M. Kazmierski, R. J. Knapp Nature 1991, 354, 82; and its correction: K. S. Lam, S. E. Salmon, E. M. Hersh, V. J. Hruby, W. M. Kazmierski, R. J. Knapp Nature 1992, 360, 768.&lt;/ref&gt; The tethered peptide library was tested with a dissolved target protein. The beads to which the protein was attached were picked out, removed the protein from the bead then the tethered peptide was identified by [[sequencing]].

A somewhat different approach was followed by Taylor and Morken.&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Taylor, J. P. Morken Science 1998, 280, 267.&lt;/ref&gt; They used [[thermography|infrared thermography]] to identify [[catalysis|catalysts]] in non-peptide tethered libraries. When the beads were immersed into a solution of a [[enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate.]] the catalyst containing beads were glowing because of the heat evolved in them and could be picked out.

The components of combinatorial libraries can also be tested one by one after cleaving them from the individual beads.

If we deal with a non-peptide [[organic compound|organic libraries library]] it is not as simple to determine of the identity of the content of a bead as in the case of a peptide one. In order to circumvent this difficulty methods were developed to attach to the beads, in parallel with the synthesis of the library, molecules that encode the identity of the compound formed in the bead. The attached molecules may form peptide&lt;ref name="J. Nielsen, S. Brenner 1993"&gt;J. Nielsen, S. Brenner, K. D. Janda J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 9812.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Nikolaiev, A.

==Materials science==
[[Materials science]] has applied the techniques of combinatorial chemistry to the discovery of new materials. This work was pioneered by [[Peter G. Schultz|P.G. Schultz]] et al. in the mid nineties&lt;ref&gt;X. -D. Xiang et al. "A Combinatorial Approach to Materials Discovery" [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/268/5218/1738 Science 268 (1995) 1738]&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of luminescent materials obtained by co-deposition of elements on a silicon substrate. His work was preceded by J. J. Hanak in 1970&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Hanak, J. Mater. Sci, 1970, 5, 964-971&lt;/ref&gt; but the computer and robotics tools were not available for the method to spread at the time.  Work has been continued by several academic groups&lt;ref&gt;Combinatorial methods for development of sensing materials, Springer, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-387-73712-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. M.

The technique has been used extensively for catalysis,&lt;ref&gt;Applied Catalysis A, Volume 254, Issue 1, Pages 1-170 (10 November 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; coatings,&lt;ref&gt;J. N.

==Diversity-oriented libraries==
Even though combinatorial chemistry has been an essential part of early drug discovery for more than two decades, so far only one de novo combinatorial chemistry-synthesized chemical has been approved for clinical use by FDA ([[sorafenib]], a multikinase inhibitor indicated for advanced renal cancer).&lt;ref&gt;D. Newman and G. Cragg "Natural Products as Sources of New Drugs over the Last 25 Years" [https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/np068054v J Nat Prod 70 (2007) 461]&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of poor success rate of the approach has been suggested to connect with the rather limited [[chemical space]] covered by products of combinatorial chemistry.&lt;ref name="pubs.acs.org"&gt;M. Feher and J. M. Schmidt "Property Distributions: Differences between Drugs, Natural Products, and Molecules from Combinatorial Chemistry" [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ci0200467 J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci., 43 (2003) 218]&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing the properties of compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries to those of approved drugs and natural products, Feher and Schmidt&lt;ref name="pubs.acs.org"/&gt;  noted that combinatorial chemistry libraries suffer particularly from the lack of [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], as well as structure rigidity, both of which are widely regarded as drug-like properties. Even though natural product [[drug discovery]] has not probably been the most fashionable trend in pharmaceutical industry in recent times,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} a large proportion of new chemical entities still are nature-derived compounds,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and thus, it has been suggested that effectiveness of combinatorial chemistry could be improved by enhancing the chemical diversity of screening libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Su QB, Beeler AB, Lobkovsky E, Porco JA, Panek JS "Stereochemical diversity through cyclodimerization: Synthesis of polyketide-like macrodiolides." Org Lett 2003, 5:2149-2152.&lt;/ref&gt; As chirality and rigidity are the two most important features distinguishing approved drugs and natural products from compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries, these are the two issues emphasized in so-called diversity oriented libraries, i.e. compound collections that aim at coverage of the chemical space, instead of just huge numbers of compounds.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Patent classification subclass ==
In the 8th edition of the [[International Patent Classification]] (IPC), which entered into force on January 1, 2006, a special subclass has been created for [[patent application]]s and [[patent]]s related to [[invention]]s in the domain of combinatorial chemistry: "C40B".

An assessment of permanent or temporary changes in a nuclear power plant is performed to evaluate if such changes are within risk criteria. For example, the probability of core (severe) damage may increase while replacing a component, but the probability would be even ''higher'' if that component were to fail because it wasn't replaced.&lt;ref name="INL_CCDP" /&gt; Risk measures, such as core damage frequency and large early release frequency (LERF), determine the risk criteria for such changes.

This risk analysis allows decision making of any changes within a nuclear power plant in accordance with legislation, safety margins and performance strategies.

A 2003 study commissioned by the [[European Commission]] remarked that "core damage frequencies of 5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [per reactor-year] are a common result" or in other words, one core damage incident in 20,000 reactor years.&lt;ref name = "CE"&gt;{{Cite journal

Assuming there are 500 reactors in use in the world, the above CDF estimates mean that, statistically, one core damage incident would be expected to occur somewhere in the world every 40 years for the 2003 [[European Commission]] estimated average accident rate or every 100 years for the 2008 [[Electric Power Research Institute]] estimated average accident rate.

According to a 2011 report by the National Resources Defense Council, about 14,400 reactor years of commercial power operation have been accrued worldwide for 582 reactors. Of these 582 reactors, 11 have suffered from serious core damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Reassessing the frequency of partial core melt accidents | date = April 27, 2011 | author = Thomas B. Cochran | publisher = National Resources Defense Council | url = http://www.energypolicyblog.com/2011/04/27/reassessing-the-frequency-of-partial-core-melt-accidents/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This historical data results in a 1954 to 2011 era average accident rate of 1 in every 1,309 reactor years (7.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; per reactor year CDF). In five of these accidents, the damage was light enough that the reactor was repaired and restarted.

During the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 earthquake and resultant 15+ meter tsunami on the east coast of Japan]], the [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima I nuclear power plant]] suffered core damages at three of its six reactors after the emergency core cooling systems failed due to the extreme [[BDBE|beyond design basis]] conditions. That is, the Fukushima plants did not consider a tsuanmi above 3.1 meters in their original design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Fukushima Was Preventable | date = March 2012 | author = James M.

However, all of these types of plants have varying designs due to regulations, individual utility preferences, and construction location. In 1995, Sandia National Laboratories estimated that the individual [[Boiling water reactor#First series of production BWRs (BWR/1–BWR/6)|BWR-3 and BWR-4]] reactors in the United States have a core damage frequency between 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/205567-BJIEKT/webviewable/205567.pdf | title = Core damage frequency perspectives for BWR 3/4 and Westinghouse 4-loop plants based on IPE results | author = Susan Dingman | publisher = US NRC | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to many applications of leaf springs in automotive suspension designs, this type does not use the spring as a locating link. While this suspension type is most notably associated with several generations of the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] the design has been used in other production [[General Motors]] cars, as well as vehicles from [[Volvo Cars]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]]. [[Fiat]] produced cars with a similar configuration, using a multi-leaf steel spring in place of the FRP mono-leaf spring.

== Design ==
[[File:leafs2.jpg|right|thumb|The C5 Corvette's rear suspension]]

The leaf-spring suspension configuration is [[independent suspension|independent]], because the movement of one wheel is not determined by the position of the other.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; [[Control arm]]s are utilized to define the motion of the wheel as the suspension is compressed. The usual coil springs are replaced with a single FRP spring, which spans the width of the car. As in independent suspension systems using coil springs, and unlike the common leaf-spring supported Hotchkiss rear axle, the suspension [[kinematics]] are defined only by the control arms.

As in a coil-spring suspension design, the FRP mono-leaf spring supports the weight of the vehicle. However, the FRP leaf springs differ from steel coils and traditional steel multi-leaf springs in a number of significant ways. The FRP plastic springs have 4.3–5.5 times the [[strain energy]] storage per weight, compared to steel.&lt;ref name=Yu&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yu |first1=W.J. |last2=Kim |first2=H.C. |title=Double tapered FRP beam for automotive suspension leaf spring |journal=Composite Structures |year=1988 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=279–300 |doi=10.1016/0263-8223(88)90049-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a lighter spring for a given application. The single FRP mono-leaf front spring used on the fourth-generation Corvette is 33&amp;nbsp;percent of the weight of an equivalent set of coil springs.&lt;ref name=Lamm&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lamm |first1=Michael |title=The Newest Corvette. Corvette from A to Z-15 |url=http://www.carbibles.com/images/fibreglass_spring.gif |date=1983 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219190009/http://www.carbibles.com/images/fibreglass_spring.gif |page=44 |edition=1st |publisher=Lamm-Morada Publishing |isbn=978-0932128041 |archive-date=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing FRP to conventional steel leaf springs in similar applications, the weight saved is even greater. The third-generation Corvette offered an optional FRP mono-leaf spring as an alternative to the standard multi-leaf steel spring, the {{convert|48|lb|kg|0|order=flip|adj=on}} steel spring being replaced by a {{convert|7|lb|kg|0|order=flip|adj=on}} FRP spring.&lt;ref name=McLellan&gt;{{cite book |last1=McLellan |first1=Dave |title=Corvette from the Inside |date=2002 |publisher=Bentley Publishers |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-8376-0859-7 |pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volvo claims a weight savings of {{convert|10|lb|kg|0|order=flip}} by using a FRP spring in the rear suspension of its second-generation [[Volvo XC90|XC90]], compared to designs using coil springs.&lt;ref name=Volvo&gt;{{cite web |title=Benteler-SGL mass-produces composite leaf springs for the new Volvo XC90 using Loctite Matrix resin from Henkel |url=http://compositesindustrynews.com/fullnews.php?ids=1298 |website=Composites Industry News |publisher=FRP Today |access-date=2015-07-30}}{{dead link|date=November 2016|reason=not at archive.org (as of May 2017)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the reduction in vehicle weight, the weight of the spring is partly [[unsprung mass]].&lt;ref name=CompWorld/&gt;

The relative sliding movement of the leaves of a multi-leaf steel spring results in stiction-based hysteresis with respect to spring compression. This stiction reduces suspension compliance and can compromise both ride quality and handling.&lt;ref name=Knowles&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knowles |first1=Don |title=Today's Technician: Automotive Suspension &amp; Steering |date=2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking individual leaves, the mono-leaf spring avoids stiction.&lt;ref name=Lamm/&gt;

FRP springs are advertised as having exceptional cycle life and corrosion resistance.&lt;ref name =Lamm/&gt; A GM test comparing the third-generation Corvette springs found that failure of the multi-leaf steel springs was likely after 200,000 full-travel cycles. The replacement FRP leaf spring showed no loss of performance after two million full cycles.&lt;ref name=McLellan/&gt;

Packaging is cited as both an advantage and disadvantage of the transverse FRP leaf spring, as compared to coil springs, depending on the application. The FRP spring is typically set low in the suspension, resulting in a low center of gravity. It also allows manufacturers to avoid tall spring mounts, thus resulting in a flatter load floor about the suspension.&lt;ref name=Volvo/&gt; James Schefter reports that, as used on the C5 and later Corvettes, the use of OEM coilover damper springs would have forced the chassis engineers to either vertically raise the shock towers or move them inward. In the rear this would have reduced trunk space. In the front this would have interfered with engine packaging. The use of the leaf spring allowed the spring to be placed under the chassis, out of the way, while keeping the diameter of the shock-absorber assembly to that of just the damper, rather than damper and spring.&lt;ref name=Schefter&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schefter |first1=James |title=All Corvettes Are Red |date=1998 |publisher=Gallery Books |isbn=978-0671685010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other applications, such as race car designs, the need to span the width of the vehicle resulted in significant design limitations. Coil and torsion springs present better packaging options for racing applications. FRP springs also have limited availability and selection as compared to coil springs.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Carroll |title=Engineer to Win |date=1984 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=9780879381868 |page=207 |quote=If I were involved in the design of a new passenger vehicle, however, I would give serious consideration to the use of a transverse composite single leaf spring of unidirectional glass or carbon filament in an epoxy matrix. This would be the lightest practical spring configuration and, although space constraints would seem to limit its use in racing, it should be perfectly feasible on road-going vehicles, from large trucks to small commuter cars. (Since I wrote this paragraph the new-generation Corvette has come out with just such a spring to control its independent suspension systems-at both end of the car.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher cost has also been cited as a disadvantage, when comparing FRP springs to coil springs on production road cars.&lt;ref name="Edmunds-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Edmunds |first1=Dan |title=2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Z51 Suspension Walkaround |url=http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/track-tests/2014-chevrolet-corvette-stingray-z51-suspension-walkaround.html |website=Edmunds |access-date=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
[[File:Deformed spring model iso and plane.JPG|thumbnail|[[Finite element analysis|FEA]] model of a leaf spring under load. The initial, unbent shape of the spring is shown as a silhouette box. An upward deflection on the right side of the spring results in a smaller upward movement on the left side.]]

A notable advantage of the FRP transverse leaf springs—when supported with widely spaced, pivotable mounts—is the ability to supplement or replace the anti-roll bar. Typically springs that provide a sufficient [[Suspension (vehicle)#Wheel rate|ride rate]] need a supplemental spring (the [[anti-roll bar]]) to increase the suspension [[Suspension (vehicle)#Roll rate|roll rate]]. The coupling of the two sides of the transverse leaf spring across the vehicle results in an anti-roll bar like behavior. Corvette engineers have cited this property as enabling the use of a lighter anti-roll bar,&lt;ref name=McLellan/&gt; and even eliminating the rear anti-roll bar on some versions of the seventh generation Corvette.&lt;ref name=Automobile&gt;{{cite news |last1=Noordeloos |first1=Marc |title=Vette Engineering Manager Explains the C7 Chassis |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/2014-corvette-engineering-manager-dishes-on-the-c7s-chassis-206465/ |access-date=2015-08-01 |work=Automobile Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When either wheel is deflected upward, the center span of the spring (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward at the same time (for example, when hitting a bump in the road) the center section bends uniformly between the pivot mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side.&lt;ref name =Lamm/&gt;&lt;ref name=McLellan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity.&lt;ref name =Lamm/&gt;

[[File:Rigid central mount transverse leaf spring.JPG|thumbnail|A transverse leaf spring with a central rigid mount. The two spring halves are effectively isolated. Movements of one half of the spring do not affect the other half.]]

A simplified flat, rectangular spring illustrates this principle. Deflecting the right side of the spring results in the left side rising. By comparison, a rigid central mount (2nd and 3rd generation Corvettes and other cars) shows no movement on one side when the other is deflected.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt;

== Recent patents and related research ==
Several automotive companies have filed patents for suspension designs using a transverse composite leaf-spring supported in a fashion similar to that of the Corvette.

* Porsche AG, 2000, patent # 6029987, ''Front Axle for a Motor Vehicle''. Describes a strut suspension system supported by a transverse leaf-spring system largely the same as that used by the Corvette. The Porsche patent mentions the beneficial stabilizing effects of this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=1gkEAAAAEBAJ&amp;zoom=4&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Patent US6029987 – Front axle for a motor vehicle |publisher=Google |date=1997-05-26 |access-date=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">In [[chemistry]], a '''dangling bond''' is an unsatisfied [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] on an immobilized [[atom]]. An atom with a dangling bond is also referred to as an '''immobilized free radical''' or an '''immobilized radical''', a reference to its structural and chemical similarity to a [[free radical]].

==Definition and properties==
In order to gain enough electrons to fill their valence shells (see also [[octet rule]]), many atoms will form [[covalent bond]]s with other atoms. In the simplest case, that of a [[single bond]], two atoms each contribute one unpaired electron, and the resulting pair of electrons is shared between them. Atoms which possess too few bonding partners to satisfy their valences and which possess unpaired electrons are termed "[[free radical]]s"; so, often, are molecules containing such atoms. When a free radical exists in an immobilized environment (for example, a solid), it is referred to as an "immobilized free radical" or a "dangling bond".

Both free and immobilized radicals display very different chemical characteristics from atoms and molecules containing only complete bonds. Generally, they are extremely [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]]. Immobilized free radicals, like their mobile counterparts, are highly unstable, but they gain some kinetic stability because of limited mobility and [[steric hindrance]]. While free radicals are usually short lived, immobilized free radicals often exhibit a longer [[Exponential decay#Mean lifetime|lifetime]] because of this reduction in reactivity.

==Dangling bonds in semiconductors==
Some [[Allotropy|allotropes]] of silicon, such as [[amorphous silicon]], display a high concentration of dangling bonds. Besides being of fundamental interest, these dangling bonds are important in modern [[semiconductor device]] operation. Hydrogen introduced to the silicon during the synthesis process is well known to replace dangling bonds, as are other elements such as oxygen.

==Computational chemistry==
In [[computational chemistry]], a dangling bond generally represents an [[error]] in structure creation, in which an atom is inadvertently drawn with too few bonding partners, or a bond is mistakenly drawn with an atom at only one end.

The '''Debye frequency''' (Symbol: &lt;math&gt; \omega_{Debye} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \omega_D &lt;/math&gt;) is a parameter in the [[Debye model]]. It refers to a cut-off [[angular frequency]] for [[wave]]s a harmonic chain of masses, used to describe the movement of [[ion]]s in a [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]] and more specifically, to correctly predict the [[heat capacity]] in such crystals to be constant for high temperatures ([[Dulong-Petit law]]). The term was first introduced by [[Peter Debye]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debye|first=P.|author-link=Peter Debye|date=|title=Zur Theorie der spezifischen Wärmen|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/andp.19123441404/full|journal=Annalen der Physik|language=en|volume=344|issue=14|pages=|doi=10.1002/andp.19123441404/full|issn=1521-3889|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this whole article [[periodic boundary conditions]] are assumed.

== Definition ==
Assuming the [[dispersion relation]] is

:&lt;math&gt; \omega = v_s |\mathbf k| &lt;/math&gt;,

with &lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of sound]] in the crystal; and '''k''' the wave vector, the value of the Debye frequency is as follows:

For a one dimensional monatomic chain the Debye frequency is equal to&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openphysicslums.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/latticevibrations.pdf|title=The one dimensional monatomic solid|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D = v_s \pi / a = v_s \pi N / L = v_s \pi \lambda &lt;/math&gt;,

with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the distance between two neighbouring atoms in the chain when the system is in its [[ground state]] (in this case that means that none of the atoms are moving with respect to each other); &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the total amount of atoms in the chain; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; the size (volume) of the system (length of the chain); and &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the [[linear density|linear number density]]. Where the following relation holds: &lt;math&gt;L = N a&lt;/math&gt;.

For a two dimensional monatomic square lattice the Debye frequency is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D^2 = \frac {4 \pi}{a^2} v_s^2 = \frac {4 \pi N}{A} v_s^2 \equiv 4 \pi \sigma v_s^2 &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; are the same as before; &lt;math&gt; A \equiv L^{2} {{=}} N a^{2} &lt;/math&gt; is the size (area) of the surface; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; the [[surface density|surface number density]].

For a three dimensional monatomic [[cubic crystal system|primitive cubic crystal]], the Debye frequency is equal to&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/sm1/lectures/node71.html|title=Specific heats of solids|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Richard|date=2006|website=Richard Fitzpatrick [[University of Texas at Austin]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D^3 = \frac {6 \pi^2}{a^3} v_s^3 = \frac {6 \pi^2 N}{V} v_s^3 \equiv 6 \pi^2 \rho v_s^3 &lt;/math&gt;,

The speed of sound in the crystal could depend on (among others) the mass of the atoms, the strength of their interaction, the [[pressure]] on the system, and/or the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the wave (longitudinal or transverse), but in the following we will first assume the speed of sound to be the same for any polarization (this assumption however does not render far-reaching implications).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/859577633|title=The Oxford Solid State Basics|last=Simon|first=Steven H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199680764|edition= First|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=859577633|author-link=Steven H. Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumed [[dispersion relation]] is easily proven wrong for a one-dimensional chain of masses, but in [[Debye model|Debye’s model]] this didn’t prove to be problematic.

== Relation to Debye's temperature ==
The Debye temperature &lt;math&gt; \theta_D &lt;/math&gt;, another parameter in Debye model, is related to the Debye frequency by the relation&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; \theta_D=\frac{\hbar}{k_B}\omega_D, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math&gt; \hbar &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]] and &lt;math&gt; k_B &lt;/math&gt;is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

==Debye's Derivation==
===Three dimensional crystal===
In Debye’s derivation of the [[heat capacity]] he sums over all possible modes of the system. That is: including different directions and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]s. He assumed the total amount of modes per polarization to be &lt;math&gt;3N&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the amount of masses in the system), or in mathematical language&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{modes}3=3 N&lt;/math&gt;,

where the &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; on both sides is because of the three polarizations, so the sum runs over all modes for one specific polarization. Debye made this assumption because he knew from [[classical mechanics]] that the amount of modes per polarization in a chain of masses should always be equal to the amount of masses in the chain.

The left hand side is now to be made explicit to show how it depends on the Debye frequency (here simply introduced as a cut-off frequency, that is: higher frequencies than the Debye frequency can’t exist), so that an expression for it could be found.

First of all, by assuming &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to be very large (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;&gt;&gt;1, with &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; the size of the system in any of the three directions) the smallest wave vector in any direction could be approximated by: &lt;math&gt; d k_i = 2 \pi / L &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;i = x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;. Smaller wave vectors can't exist because of the [[periodic boundary conditions]]. Thus the summation would become [https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/oxford-solid-state-basics 4]

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{modes}3=\frac {3 V}{(2 \pi)^3} \iiint d \mathbf k&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf k \equiv (k_x, k_y, k_z) &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; V \equiv L^3 &lt;/math&gt; is the size of the system; and the integral is (as the summation) over all possible modes, which is assumed to be an finite region (bounded by the cut-off frequency).

The triple integral could be rewritten as a single integral over all possible values of the absolute value of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf k &lt;/math&gt; (see: [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian for spherical coordinates]]). The result is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {3 V}{(2 \pi)^3} \iiint d \mathbf k = \frac {3 V}{2 \pi^2} \int_0^{k_D} |\mathbf k|^2 d \mathbf k &lt;/math&gt;,

with &lt;math&gt;k_D&lt;/math&gt; the absolute value of the wave vector corresponding with the Debye frequency, so &lt;math&gt;k_D = \omega_D/v_s&lt;/math&gt;.

Since we know the dispersion relation to be &lt;math&gt;\omega =v_s|\mathbf k|&lt;/math&gt;, this can be written as an integral over all possible &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {3 V}{2 \pi^2} \int_0^{k_D} |\mathbf k|^2 d \mathbf k = \frac {3 V}{2 \pi^2 v_s^3} \int_0^{\omega_D} \omega^2 d \omega &lt;/math&gt;,

After solving the integral it is again equated to &lt;math&gt;3 N&lt;/math&gt; to find

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {V}{2 \pi^2 v_s^3} \omega_D^3 = 3 N &lt;/math&gt;.

Conclusion:

:&lt;math&gt;  \omega_D^3 =\frac {6 \pi^2 N}{V} v_s^3 &lt;/math&gt;.

===One dimensional chain===
The same derivation could be done for a one dimensional chain of atoms. The amount of modes remains unchanged, because there are still three polarizations. So

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{modes}3=3 N&lt;/math&gt;.

The rest of the derivation is analogous to the previous, so again the left hand side is rewritten

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{modes}3=\frac {3 L}{2 \pi} \int_{-k_D}^{k_D}d k = \frac {3 L}{\pi v_s} \int_{0}^{\omega_D}d \omega&lt;/math&gt;.

In the last step the multiplication by two is because &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; runs negative, but &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; doesn’t.

We continue

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {3 L}{\pi v_s} \int_{0}^{\omega_D}d \omega = \frac {3 L}{\pi v_s} \omega_D = 3 N &lt;/math&gt;.

Conclusion:

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D = \frac {\pi v_s N}{L} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Two dimensional crystal===
The same derivation could be done for a two dimensional crystal. Again, the amount of modes remains unchanged, because there are still three polarizations. The derivation is analogous to the previous two. We start with the same equation,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{modes}3=3 N&lt;/math&gt;.

And then the left hand side is rewritten and equated to &lt;math&gt;3N&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{modes}3=\frac {3 A}{(2 \pi)^2} \iint d \mathbf k = \frac {3 A}{2 \pi v_s^2} \int_{0}^{\omega_D} \omega d \omega = \frac {3 A \omega_D^2}{4 \pi v_s^2} = 3 N &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; A \equiv L^2&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the system.

Conclusion

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D^2 = \frac {4 \pi N}{A} v_s^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

==Allowing polarization to make a difference==
As mentioned in the introduction: in general, longitudinal waves have a different wave velocity than transverse waves. For clarity they were first assumed to be equal, but now we drop that assumption.

The dispersion relation becomes &lt;math&gt; \omega_i = v_{s,i}|\mathbf k|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; i = 1, 2, 3 &lt;/math&gt;, which correspond to the three polarizations. The cut-off frequency (Debye frequency) however does not depend on &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. And we can write the total amount of modes as &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i}\sum_{modes} 1 &lt;/math&gt;, which is again equal to &lt;math&gt;3 N&lt;/math&gt;. Here the summation over the modes is (although not explicitly stated) dependent on &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

===One dimension===
Once again the summation over the modes is rewritten

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i}\sum_{modes} 1 = \sum_i \frac {L}{\pi v_{s,i}} \int_0^{\omega_D} d \omega_i = 3 N &lt;/math&gt;.

The result is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {L \omega_D}{\pi} (\frac {1}{v_{s,1}} + \frac {1}{v_{s,2}} + \frac {1}{v_{s,3}}) = 3 N &lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the Debye frequency is found

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D = \frac {3 \pi N}{L} \frac {v_{s,1} v_{s,2} v_{s,3}}{v_{s,2} v_{s,3} + v_{s,1} v_{s,3} + v_{s,1} v_{s,2}} &lt;/math&gt;.

Or by assuming the two transverse polarizations to be the same (to have the same phase speed and frequency)

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D = \frac {3 \pi N}{L} \frac {v_{s,t}^2 v_{s,l}}{2 v_{s,t} v_{s,l} + v_{s,t}^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

One can check this relation is equivalent to the one found earlier (when polarization didn't make a difference) by setting &lt;math&gt; v_{s,t} = v_{s,l} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Two dimensions===
The same derivation can be done for a two dimensional crystal to find (the derivation is analogous to previous derivations)

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D^2 = \frac {12 \pi N}{A} \frac {(v_{s,1} v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^2}{(v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^2 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,3})^2 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,2})^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Or by assuming the two transverse polarizations are equal (although for two dimensions it would be more logical if all polarizations would be different):

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D^2 = \frac {12 \pi N}{A} \frac {(v_{s,t}^2 v_{s,l})^2}{2 (v_{s,t} v_{s,l})^2 + v_{s,t}^4} &lt;/math&gt;.

Again, one can check this relation is equivalent to the one found earlier by setting &lt;math&gt; v_{s,t} = v_{s,l} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Three dimensions===
The same derivation can be done for a three dimensional crystal to find (the derivation is analogous to previous derivations)

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D^3 = \frac {18 \pi^2 N}{V} \frac {(v_{s,1} v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^3}{(v_{s,2} v_{s,3})^3 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,3})^3 + (v_{s,1} v_{s,2})^3} &lt;/math&gt;.

Or by assuming the two transverse polarizations are equal (although for three dimensions it would be more logical when all polarizations would be the same):

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_D^3 = \frac {18 \pi^2 N}{V} \frac {(v_{s,t}^2 v_{s,l})^3}{2 (v_{s,t} v_{s,l})^3 + v_{s,t}^6} &lt;/math&gt;.

Again, one can check this relation is equivalent to the one found earlier by setting &lt;math&gt; v_{s,t} = v_{s,l} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Derivation with the actual dispersion relation==
[[File:phonon k 3k.gif|right|thumb|250px|Because only the [[Discretization|discretized]] points matter two different waves could render the same physical manifestation (see [[Phonon]]).]]
This problem could be made more insightful by making it more complex. Instead of using the dispersion relation &lt;math&gt; \omega = v_s k &lt;/math&gt;, the correct dispersion relation is now going to be assumed. From classical mechanics it is known that for an equidistant chain of masses which interact harmonically with each other the dispersion relation reads as follows&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \omega (k) = 2 \sqrt {\frac {\kappa}{m}}|\sin(\frac {k a}{2})| &lt;/math&gt;.

After plotting this relation, it is clear that Debye’s estimation of the cut-off wavelength was right after all. Because for every wavenumber bigger than &lt;math&gt;\pi / a &lt;/math&gt; (that is: &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; is smaller than &lt;math&gt;2 a&lt;/math&gt;) a wavenumber that is smaller than &lt;math&gt;\pi / a&lt;/math&gt; could be found with the same angular frequency. This means the resulting physical manifestation for the mode with the larger wavenumber is indistinguishable from the one with the smaller wavenumber. This is possible because of the fact that the system consists of [[Discretization|discretized]] points, as is demonstrated in the gif. Dividing the dispersion relation by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and inserting &lt;math&gt;\pi / a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, we find the speed of a wave with &lt;math&gt;k = \pi / a&lt;/math&gt; to be

&lt;math&gt; v_s(k = \pi / a) = \frac {2 a}{\pi} \sqrt {\frac {\kappa}{m}} &lt;/math&gt;.

By simply inserting &lt;math&gt;k = \pi/a&lt;/math&gt; in the original dispersion relation we find

&lt;math&gt; \omega(k = \pi / a) = 2 \sqrt {\frac {\kappa}{m}} = \omega_D &lt;/math&gt;.

Combining these results the same result is once again found

&lt;math&gt; \omega_D = \frac {\pi v_s}{a} &lt;/math&gt;.

However, for diatomic chains (and more complex chains) the associated cut-off frequency (and wavelength) is not very accurate, since the cut-off wavelength is twice as big and the dispersion relation exists of two branches (for a diatomic chain). It is also not certain from this whether for more dimensional systems the cut-off frequency was accurately predicted by Debye.

==Alternative Derivation==
[[File:CPT-sound-nyquist-thereom-1.5percycle.svg|thumb|250px|The physical result of two waves can be identical when at least one of them has a wavelength that is bigger than twice the initial distance between the masses (taken from [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]]).]]

For a one dimensional chain this result could also be reproduced using theory on aliasing. The [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]] is used in the following derivation; the main difference being that in the following derivation the discretization is not in time, but in space. If we use the correct dispersion relation from last paragraph, it will be clear in another insightful way why the cut-off frequency has the value previously (twice) derived. So again,

&lt;math&gt; \omega (k) = 2 \sqrt {\frac {\kappa}{m}}|\sin(\frac {k a}{2})| &lt;/math&gt;

is assumed.

This derivation is completely equivalent to the previous one, that is: the same assumptions are made to retrieve the result. It is not more or less accurate, it is just a different approach.

To determine where the cut-off frequency should be, it is useful to first determine where the cut-off of the wavelength should be. From the dispersion relation we know that for &lt;math&gt; k &gt; \pi / a &lt;/math&gt; every mode is repeated, so the cut-off wavelength would be at &lt;math&gt; \lambda_D = 2 a &lt;/math&gt;. From this and the periodic boundary conditions you can immediately see that the total amount of modes per polarization would be &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. As seen in the gif of the previous paragraph this is because every wave with a wavelength shorter than &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt; could be replaced by a wave with a wavelength longer than &lt;math&gt; 2a &lt;/math&gt; to regain the same physical result.

However, the dispersion relation from previous paragraph (the correct one) isn't even necessary in reasoning as to why the cut-off should be at &lt;math&gt; \lambda = 2a &lt;/math&gt;. Because, as is depicted, only waves with a longer wavelength than &lt;math&gt; 2a &lt;/math&gt; could render the same physical result as another one. So this is another way to correctly predict the cut-off wavelength without using the correct dispersion relation (or even knowledge from classical mechanics as Debye did). However, using the wrong dispersion relation which Debye assumed, waves with a smaller wavelength would have a higher frequency, but the relative movement of the masses would be the same, so this doesn't render new modes.

This results again in &lt;math&gt; k_D = \pi / a &lt;/math&gt;, rendering

&lt;math&gt; \omega_D = \frac {\pi v_s}{a} &lt;/math&gt;.

Also here it doesn't matter which dispersion relation is used (the correct one or the one Debye used), the same cut-off frequency would be found.

Unfortunately, the same method could not be used (as easily) for a two- or three-dimensional crystal, because diagonal waves would have a larger cut-off wavelength, which are also difficult to predict.

It has been shown that including [[magnetic monopole]] in [[Maxwell's equations]] introduces a singularity. The only way to avoid the singularity is including a second four-vector potential, called dual photon, in addition to the usual four-vector potential, photon.&lt;ref name="singleton"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it was found that the standard Lagrangian of electromagnetism is not dual symmetric that causes dual-asymmetric problems of the energy–momentum, spin and orbital angular-momentum tensors. To resolve this issue, a dual-symmetric Lagrangian of electromagnetism has been proposed,&lt;ref name="bliokh" /&gt; which has a self-consistent separation of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The Poincaré symmetries imply that the dual electromagnetism naturally makes self-consistent conservation laws.&lt;ref name="bliokh" /&gt;

==Dual electromagnetism==

The free [[Electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field]] is described by a covariant [[antisymmetric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; of rank 2 by

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha \beta} \, = \, \partial_{\alpha} A_{\beta} \, - \, \partial_{\beta} A_{\alpha} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the electromagnetic potential.

The dual electromagnetic field &lt;math&gt;\star F_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\star F_{\alpha \beta} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\mu\nu}{}^{\sigma\lambda} F_{\sigma\lambda} .&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Hodge dual]], and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{\mu\nu\sigma\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita tensor]]

For both the electromagnetic field and its dual field, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\alpha} F^{\alpha \beta} \, = \, 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\alpha} \star F^{\alpha \beta} \, = \, 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for a given gauge field &lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, the dual configuration &lt;math&gt;\star A_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;ref name="bakas" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \star F^{\alpha \beta}(A) \, = \, F^{\alpha \beta} (\star A),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \star F^{\alpha \beta}(\star A) \, = \, -F^{\alpha \beta} (A).&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\star A_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the field potential of the dual photon, and non-locally linked to the original field potential &lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

==p-form electrodynamics==

A p-form generalization of Maxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]] is described by a [[gauge invariant]] [[2-form]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=d\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

which satisfies the equation of motion

:&lt;math&gt;d\star\mathbf{F}=\star\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hodge dual]].

This implies the following [[action (physics)|action]] in the [[spacetime]] [[manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="henneaux1"&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int_M \left[\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{F}\wedge \star\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{A} \wedge \star\mathbf{J}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\star\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the dual of the [[gauge invariant]] [[2-form]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; for the [[Electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field]].

==Dark photon==
[[File:Dark Photons.png|left|thumb|This artist's impression shows the [[dark photon]] ''A''' decays into a pair of electron and positron.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite press |date=10 November 2014 |title=Viewpoint: New Light Shed on Dark Photons|url=https://physics.aps.org/articles/v7/115/ |publisher=[[American Physical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[dark photon]] is a spin-1 [[boson]] associated with a U(1) [[gauge field]], which could be massless&lt;ref name=carroll&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Dark photons|url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2008/10/29/dark-photons/|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and behaves like [[electromagnetism]]. But, it could be unstable and massive, quickly decays into [[electron]]-[[positron]] pairs, and interact with [[electron]]s.

The dark photon was first suggested in 2008 by Lotty Ackerman, Matthew R. Buckley, [[Sean M. Carroll]], and [[Marc Kamionkowski]] to explain the [[Anomalous magnetic dipole moment|'g–2 anomaly']] in experiment E821 at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Final report of the E821 muon anomalous magnetic moment measurement at BNL|url = http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.73.072003|journal = [[Physical Review D]]|date = 2006-04-07|pages = 072003|volume = 73|issue = 7|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.73.072003|first1 = G.

In 2015, the [[ATOMKI|Hungarian Academy of Sciences's Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Debrecen]], Hungary, suggested the existence of a new, light spin-1 [[boson]], 34 times heavier than the electron&lt;ref name="Cartlidge2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cartlidge|first=Edwin|title=Has a Hungarian physics lab found a fifth force of nature?|url=http://www.nature.com/news/has-a-hungarian-physics-lab-found-a-fifth-force-of-nature-1.19957|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19957}}&lt;/ref&gt; that decays into a pair of electron and positron with a combined energy of 17 MeV. In 2016, it was proposed that it is a X-boson with a mass of 16.7&amp;nbsp;MeV that explains [[Anomalous magnetic dipole moment#Muon|m-2 muon anomaly]].&lt;ref name="Cartlidge2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="feng1"&gt;

'''Equivalent series inductance''' ('''ESL''') is an effective [[inductance]] that is used to describe the inductive part of the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of certain electrical components.

==Overview== 
The theoretical treatment of devices such as [[capacitor]]s and [[resistor]]s tends to assume they are ''ideal'' or "perfect" devices, contributing only capacitance or resistance to the [[electrical circuit|circuit]]. However, all physical devices are connected to a circuit through conductive leads and paths, which contain inherent, usually unwanted, inductance. This means that physical components contain some inductance in addition to their other properties.

An easy way to deal with these inherent inductances in circuit analysis is by using a [[lumped element model]] to express each physical component as a combination of an ideal component and a small [[inductor]] in [[series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], the inductor having a value equal to the inductance present in the non-ideal, physical device.

==Effects==
Ideally, the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of a [[capacitor]] falls with increasing frequency at 20 dB/decade. However, due partly to the inductive properties of the connections, and partly to non-ideal characteristics of the capacitor material, real capacitors also have inductive properties whose impedance ''rises'' with frequency at 20 dB/decade. At the ''resonance frequency'' the sum of both is minimal, above it the [[parasitic inductance|parasitic series inductance]] of the capacitor dominates.

The '''Fiat Palio''' is a [[supermini car]] which was produced by the Italian manufacturer [[Fiat]] since 1996 until 2017. It is a [[world car]], developed by [[Fiat Automóveis]] and aimed at [[developing countries]]. It has been produced in various countries worldwide, and its platform was also used in the [[Fiat Siena|Siena]] sedan, the Palio Weekend station wagon, the Palio Adventure crossover and the [[Fiat Strada|Strada]] light pick-up truck.

==Origins of the Palio badge==
The Palio badge originated on the Mark II [[Fiat 127]], of 1977, where it was a trim designation rather than an actual model.  The 127 Palio featured alloy wheels, a more luxurious interior, and a metallic paint finish as found on the 127 Sport. The Palio designation was also used on other Fiat models throughout the 1980s and 1990s in various markets.

===1996–2000===
[[File:Fiat Palio 2000 first generation 5door.jpg|thumb|left|Fiat Palio (Italy)]]
Launched in 1996 in Brazil, as part of Fiat's "Project 178", the Palio was Fiat's first attempt to build a [[No frills#No-frills automobiles|world car]], the same basic design being produced in numerous nations around the globe. Four principal models were produced: hatchback, sedan, pickup, and station wagon, with different versions being built for different markets. The powerplants, both diesel and petrol, also varied from region to region depending on local production capability, legislation, and market requirements.

The basic chassis was a development of the European [[Fiat Uno]] but little remained unchanged. The entire structure was significantly stronger to be suitable on the rougher roads found in some of the markets for which it was intended. The suspension layout, as on the Uno, consisted of MacPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam at the rear, even though the Weekend (station wagon) version had the fully independent trailing arms rear end from the [[Fiat Punto#First generation|Fiat Punto]] instead. The body was a completely new design by the [[I.DE.A Institute]] of [[Turin]], which also designed the new interior. Some engines were also coming from other Fiat models, such as the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] and the [[Fiat Bravo and Brava|Bravo]].

Production began in 1996 in Brazil and was followed later that year by a plant in [[Argentina]]. In 1997,  production started in [[Venezuela]], [[Poland]] for the European market, and [[Morocco]] (at the Somaca plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somaca.e-monsite.com/ |title=Somaca Casablanca |publisher=Somaca.e-monsite.com |date= |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) whilst [[Turkey]] started building the same car in 1998. In [[India]], assembly was at Pune in the new Fiat-[[Tata Motors]] factory and in [[South Africa]]  by [[Nissan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://car-cat.com/firm-1379.html |title=Fiat. Fiat In South Africa |publisher=Car-cat.com |date= |accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; together the pickup version called [[Fiat Strada]]. Production in India and South Africa began in 1999, in Egypt in 2001, and in [[China]] in 2002. The Palio Weekend station wagon was launched in 1996 in Brazil and later in Europe. The station wagon is the version most commonly sold in Europe.

===2001–2003===
[[File:2002 Fiat Palio Weekend.JPG|thumb|left|2001 Fiat Palio Weekend (Europe)]]
In 2001, the model had its first facelift. The new design was made by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[automobile design]]er [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. This facelift included new front and rear fasciae and a brand new interior. Also, new engines came for the Palio: the [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|Fire]] 16-valve 1.0-L and 1.2-L and the Sporting, a 1.6-L 16-valve engine with 120&amp;nbsp;hp made in Turkey. The 2001 Palio was the first Fiat to be made in China, by [[Nanjing Automobile]]. In some markets, this generation included a [[Continuously variable transmission|Speedgear]] semiautomatic option. The Palio 2001 facelift is the ultimate version sold in Italy. In 2001, Fiat introduced for the South American market the [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] version, called Palio Adventure and based on the Palio Weekend. In Europe, the Palio Weekend was succeeded in 2003 by the [[Fiat Idea]] MPV.

====Nanjing Fiat Palio====
In November 2001, the Chinese Fiat Palio debuted, with either the {{convert|60|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.2-L or the {{convert|85|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.5-L. The [[Fiat Siena|Siena]] sedan was added in November 2002, followed by the Palio Weekend in June 2003. The Palio Weekend were not available with the smaller engine. A 1.6-L 72kW weekend was planned but never been sold.&lt;ref name=WOC&gt;{{cite book | title = World of Cars 2006·2007 | publisher = Media Connection Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 236 | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safety rating====
A [[Fiat Albea]], the [[sedan (car)|sedan]] version of the Palio, was tested in [[Russia]] according to the [[Euro NCAP]] latest standard (offset frontal crash at 64&amp;nbsp;km/h). The Albea scored 8,5 points in the frontal test, equivalent to three stars. The tested vehicle was equipped with standard driver airbag and regular seatbelts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoreview.ru/archive/2007/08/crash_albea "Albea Crash Results"]. AutoReview Magazine, Russia. No 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fiat Perla, the Chinese version of the Albea, was tested in [[China]] by China-NCAP in three different tests: 100% front crash test with a wall (similar to the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] test), a 40% offset test (similar to Euro NCAP), and a side crash test.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Perla scored 8.06 points in the 100% frontal crash test, equivalent to three stars; 12.02 pts in the 40% offset crash test, equivalent to four stars, and 10,96 pts in the side crash test, equivalent to three stars;{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} with an average result of 31 points and three stars. The tested vehicle was equipped with standard driver and passenger airbags and regular seatbelts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China-NCap results|url=http://www.c-ncap.org/content/pzjg/Alcyc/pailang.htm|publisher=C-NCAP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304002025/http://www.c-ncap.org/content/pzjg/Alcyc/pailang.htm|archivedate=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–2006===
[[File:Fiat Palio Stile Multijet Diesel-edit1.jpg|thumb|left|2004 Fiat Palio (India)]]
The third revision was released in 2004, designed again by Giorgetto Giugiaro. It is basically a facelift from the previous models. The 2004 Palio was the first Brazilian model in the B-segment available with four [[airbag]]s (two front airbags and two side airbags), parking assistance, and light and rain sensor. In Europe, the new model featured a redesigned front fascia and interior with rear fascia similar to Palio 2001 version. It has also a sport version called the Palio 1.8R' which has a new version of the General Motors 1.8-L [[GM Family 1 engine#GM do Brazil|X18XE Powertrain]] engine rated at 115&amp;nbsp;hp (ethanol) and 112&amp;nbsp;hp (gasoline), lowered suspension, new 14-inch alloy wheels, new seats, and other sporting features. The third generation of the Palio had huge sales numbers, even getting higher sales in some months than the [[VW Golf]], the Brazilian best-selling car for over 24 years. It is currently sold as the Palio Fire Economy as a cheaper alternative to its posterior facelift, with alterations derived from the [[Fiat Uno|Uno Mille Fire Economy]] model. The top model is still Weekend Adventure version; it is equipped with a 1.8-L Powertrain Flex fuel engine with 112&amp;nbsp;hp (petrol/gasoline) and 114&amp;nbsp;hp (ethanol) at 5500 rpm, all-terrain Pirelli Citynet tires, and a higher/reinforced suspension kit but still with 4x2 drive.

Fiat India is manufacturing the 2004 Palio, with 2001-version interiors, at the Ranjangaon plant along with the [[Fiat Grande Punto|Grande Punto]] and [[Fiat Linea|Linea]]. After entering into a partnership with Tata Motors, the Palio has been relaunched as the Palio Stile, with the 1.1-L Fire, 1.6-L Torque, and 1.3-L [[Multijet]] engines. Sales have been low at hardly 200 units per month.{{Clear left}}

===2007–2016===
[[File:Fiat-palio20084.jpg|thumb|left|2007 Fiat Palio]]
[[File:Fiatpalioadventure2010.jpg|thumb|right|2010 Fiat Palio Adventure]]
The last Palio facelift was launched in 2007, in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], Brazil. The design of the body was inspired by the new version of the Grande Punto, which was launched in Brazil in the first quarter of 2008.

This fourth facelift included new front, rear, and side designs, but it kept the original chassis from the 1996 model, being marketed as the New Palio. It also has a minor change in the instrument panel with differences between the two variants sold.

The trims for this new Palio are ELX with the 1.0- or the 1.4-L Fire engines, both flex (ethanol and petrol) and the "sporty"  version 1.8R with the current revision of the [[GM Family 1 engine#GM do Brazil|1.8-L 8-valve engine]] from GM, also flexible. The new Torque engines were added to the Palio after the launch of the Grande Punto. The Palio Adventure introduced the new [[limited slip differential]] and new suspension for off road with front-wheel drive.

In 2015 the station-wagon variant has been renamed as ''Fiat Weekend'', dropping the Palio name.{{Clear}}

An all-new generation of Palio was revealed in October 2011, at the annual Fiat dealers' meeting in [[Mykonos]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotivebusiness.com.br/noticia/11870/Fiat%20j%C3%A1%20apresentou%20novo%20Palio%20em%20Mykonos |title=Fiat já apresentou novo Palio em Mykonos |publisher=Automotivebusiness.com.br |date=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official launch, however, took place on 4 November 2011, in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br/novo-palio-2012-fiat-apresenta-seu-mais-novo-compacto-que-chega-a-partir-de-r30-990/ |title=Novo Palio 2012 |publisher=Noticiasautomotivas.com.br |date=4 November 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first total remodeling since launch in 1996. The project, code named 326, was anticipated by the success of the new [[Fiat Uno]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat Palio 326 series specification|url=http://autoblog.com.ar/2011/11/desde-brasil-el-nuevo-fiat-palio-llegara-a-la-argentina-en-marzo/|publisher=Autoblog.com.ar|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the new versions will be the Sporting, a trim level known for the sporty versions of the [[Fiat Siena|Siena]], [[Fiat Uno|Uno]], [[Fiat Idea|Idea]], [[Fiat Bravo (2007)|Bravo]], and [[Fiat Strada|Strada]]. In late 2017, the Fiat Palio assembly line stopped in Argentina, due to Fiat plans to start assembling the new Fiat [[Fiat Cronos|Cronos]], the [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] version of Fiat [[Fiat Argo|Argo]], as well as a basic version of Argo without [[UConnect]] multimedia system, making the Palio officially discontinued worldwide after 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autossegredos.com.br/mercado/obituario-fiat-palio-e-palio-fire-e-way-ja-nao-sao-mais-produzidos/|title=Obituário: Primeira e segunda gerações do Fiat Palio deixam de ser produzidas|last=Vidal|first=Marlos Ney|date=27 November 2017|work=Autos Segredos|access-date=30 November 2017|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric versions==
[[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] is joining utility companies [[Cemig]] and [[Itaipu (company)|Itaipu]] to develop new electric vehicles for Brazil, with an initial batch of Fiat Palio cars scheduled to start testing later 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Viknesh&amp;nbsp;Vijayenthiran |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/fiat-launching-electric-cars-in-brazil.html |title=Fiat launching electric cars in Brazil |publisher=MotorAuthority |date=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motorsport==
Several competition and [[homologation|homologated]] versions of the Palio have been produced, such as the A6 class rally car, multiple Brazilian and South American champion of the A6 class with Brazilian Luis Tedesco as driver, and the Turkish Fiat Rally Team-created Palio [[Super 1600]] [[Abarth]] rally car, with a 215-hp 1.6-L 16-valve engine and a six-speed sequential transmission. Turkey also boasts an N2 Palio.

==Safety==
The first generation design of Fiat Palio, that suffered very few structural changes from 1997, has been rated as highly unsafe by Latin NCAP in 2010, scoring only one star for adult occupants and two stars for children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinncap.com/data/pdf/fiat-palio-elx-en.pdf Latin NCAP report] Fiat Palio - without airbags&lt;/ref&gt; Its air bag-equipped version scored three stars, although it is a vast minority in the sales mix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinncap.com/data/pdf/fiat-palio-elx-airbag-en.pdf Latin NCAP report] Fiat Palio - with airbags&lt;/ref&gt; This changed with the Brazilian law requiring dual front airbags from 2014 on.&lt;ref name="ncappress"&gt;[http://www.latinncap.com/en/?pg=press_item&amp;id=84ece77d0129d2 Press release] Latin America’s top selling cars not safe enough says Latin NCAP&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">A '''fluoroanion''' is an [[anion]] that contains an element and fluorine atoms. They are also known as '''complex fluorides'''. They can occur in salts, or in solution, but not as pure acids. They often contain elements in higher oxidation states. They mostly can be considered as fluorometalates which are a subclass of halometalates.

'''Ground reinforcement''' is a reinforcing element placed on a flat surface in order to increase accessibility for [[vehicle]]s and ensure proper rainwater drainage in addition to protection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reinforcement Grids for Walkways, Pathways, Car Parks|url=http://www.matsgrids.co.uk/5-ground-reinforcement|website=www.matsgrids.co.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reinforcing element, usually in the form of grids, is used beneath [[grass]], [[asphalt]], [[concrete]] in [[roads]], [[parking lots]], [[driveways]] and [[Sidewalk|paths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIY Guide: How To Lay A Gravel Driveway|url=https://www.littlehouseonthecorner.com/lay-a-gravel-driveway/|website=www.littlehouseonthecorner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
The materials used for ground reinforcement include [[iron]], [[plywood]] and [[recycled plastic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gridforce.co.uk/grass-protection-grids&lt;/ref&gt; [[Recycled plastic]] possesses the desirable properties of water resistance and recycling opportunities, in addition to the [[sustainability]].

==Installation==
Iron plates, being heavy, are generally installed using a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] while [[plywood]] and [[plastic]] reinforcements are placed by hand.

'''HTR-10''' is a 10 MWt prototype [[pebble bed reactor]] at [[Tsinghua University]] in [[China]]. Construction began in 1995, achieving its first criticality in December 2000, and was operated in full power condition in January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = HTR-10 | url = http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/ineten/5696/index.html | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2013-02-25	}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two HTR-PM units, scaled up versions of the HTR with 250-MWt capacity, are under construction at the [[Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant]] near the city of [[Rongcheng, Shandong|Rongcheng]] in [[Shandong|Shandong Province]].

[[File:IED Baghdad from munitions.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Ammunition rigged for an IED discovered by [[Iraqi police]] in Baghdad in November 2005]]

An '''improvised explosive device''' ('''IED''') is a [[bomb]] constructed and deployed in ways other than in [[conventional warfare|conventional]] [[military]] action. It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such as an artillery shell, attached to a detonating mechanism. IEDs are commonly used as '''roadside bombs'''.

IEDs are generally seen in heavy [[terrorist]] actions or in [[asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] [[unconventional warfare]] by [[insurgent]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s or [[commando]] forces in a [[theater (warfare)|theatre of operations]]. In the second [[Iraq War]], IEDs were used extensively against US-led invasion forces and by the end of 2007 they had become responsible for approximately 63% of coalition deaths in Iraq.&lt;ref name="icasualties" /&gt; They are also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and have caused over 66% of coalition casualties in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001–present Afghanistan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=National&amp;ArticleID=news/capfeed/national/n102529A.xml |title=home.mytelus.com |publisher=home.mytelus.com |accessdate=2012-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314021502/http://home.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=National&amp;ArticleID=news%2Fcapfeed%2Fnational%2Fn102529A.xml |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IEDs were also used extensively by cadres of the rebel [[Tamil Tiger]] (LTTE) organisation against military targets in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/srilanka/globalthreat.html |title=Suicide Terrorism: A Global Threat |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/04/13/stories/2006041304711500.htm |title=13 killed in blasts, arson in Sri Lanka |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2006-04-13 |accessdate=2009-10-18 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
An IED is a bomb fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, [[pyrotechnic]], or [[incendiary device|incendiary]] [[chemical industry|chemicals]] and designed to destroy or incapacitate personnel or vehicles. In some cases, IEDs are used to distract, disrupt, or delay an opposing force, facilitating another type of attack.&lt;ref name="AAP-6"&gt;{{cite book | title = NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions (AAP-6) | year = 2010 | publisher = [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] | url = http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/doctrine/other/aap6.pdf | format = PDF | page = 2–1–2 | access-date = 2012-11-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151017194022/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/doctrine/other/aap6.pdf | archive-date = 2015-10-17 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; IEDs may incorporate [[military]] or commercially sourced explosives, and often combine both types, or they may otherwise be made with homemade explosives (HME). An HME lab refers to a Homemade Explosive Lab, or the physical location where the devices are crafted.

An IED has five components: a switch (activator), an initiator (fuse), container (body), charge (explosive), and a power source (battery). An IED designed for use against armoured targets such as personnel carriers or tanks will be designed for armour penetration, by using a [[shaped charge]] that creates an [[explosively formed penetrator]].  IEDs are extremely diverse in design and may contain many types of initiators, detonators, penetrators, and explosive loads.

Antipersonnel IEDs typically also contain fragmentation-generating objects such as nails, ball bearings or even small rocks to cause wounds at greater distances than blast pressure alone could. In the conflicts of the [[21st century]], anti-personnel improvised explosive devices (IED) have partially replaced conventional or military [[landmines]] as the source of injury to dismounted ([[pedestrian]]) soldiers and civilians. These injuries were recently reported in [[BMJ Open]] to be far worse with IEDs than with [[landmines]] resulting in multiple limb [[amputation]]s and lower body mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Smith S et al.|date= 2017|title= Injury profile suffered by targets of antipersonnel improvised explosive devices: prospective cohort study|journal= BMJ Open|volume= 7|issue= 7|page= e014697|doi= 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014697|pmc= 5691184|pmid= 28835410}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of injuries has been given the name "Dismounted Complex Blast Injury" and is thought to be the worst survivable injury ever seen in [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Cannon JW et al.|date= 2016|title= Dismounted Complex Blast Injuries: A Comprehensive Review of the Modern Combat Experience.|url= http://www.journalacs.org/article/S1072-7515(16)30689-5/fulltext|journal= J Am Coll Surg|volume= 223|issue= 4|pages= 652–664|doi= 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2016.07.009|pmc= |pmid= 27481095|access-date= 28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IEDs are triggered by various methods, including remote control, infrared or magnetic triggers, pressure-sensitive bars or trip wires (victim-operated). In some cases, multiple IEDs are wired together in a [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] to attack a convoy of vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83P4pNkl7C4&amp;t=4s|title=Insane IED Daisy Chain Attack in Syria|last=genel bakış|date=30 May 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; spread out along a roadway.

IEDs made by inexperienced designers or with substandard materials may fail to [[detonation|detonate]], and in some cases, they actually detonate on either the maker or the placer of the device. Some groups, however, have been known to produce sophisticated devices constructed with components scavenged from conventional [[munition]]s and standard consumer [[electronics]] components, such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[Family Radio Service|consumer-grade two-way radios]], washing machine timers, pagers, or garage door openers. The sophistication of an IED depends on the training of the designer and the tools and materials available.

IEDs may use artillery shells or conventional [[explosive material|high-explosive]] charges as their explosive load as well as homemade explosives. However, the threat exists that toxic [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], or radioactive ([[dirty bomb]]) material may be added to a device, thereby creating other life-threatening effects beyond the shrapnel, concussive blasts and fire normally associated with bombs. [[Chlorine]] liquid has been [[Chlorine bombings in Iraq|added to IEDs in Iraq]], producing clouds of chlorine gas.

A '''vehicle-borne IED''', or '''VBIED''', is a military term for a [[car bomb]] or truck bomb but can be any type of transportation such as a bicycle, motorcycle, donkey ({{vanchor|DBIED}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Afghanistan|series=Country Travel Guide Series|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|first=Paul|last=Clammer|year=2007|p=171|isbn=9781740596428|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjhP76JaVgkC&amp;pg=PA71}}
&lt;/ref&gt;), etc. They are typically employed by [[insurgent]]s in particular [[ISIS]], and can carry a relatively large payload. They can also be detonated from a remote location. VBIEDs can create additional shrapnel through the destruction of the vehicle itself and use vehicle fuel as an [[incendiary weapon]]. The act of a person's being in this vehicle and detonating it is known as an SVBIED [[Suicide attack|suicide]].

Of increasing popularity among insurgent forces in Iraq is the house-borne IED, or HBIED from the common military practice of clearing houses; insurgents rig an entire house to detonate and collapse shortly after a clearing squad has entered.

==Blast wave PTSD research==
In addition to known [[posttraumatic stress]] disorder (PTSD) risk factors experienced by both civilians and military personnel in combat areas; in early 2018, it was reported by ''[[60 Minutes]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brian-mancini-brain-how-ieds-may-be-physically-causing-ptsd/ Pelley, Scott] "How IEDs may be physically causing PTSD"; ''60 Minutes'', 1 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; that neuropathology specialist Dr. [[Daniel Perl|Daniel "Dan" Perl]] had conducted research on brain tissue exposed to [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), discovering a cause-and-effect relationship between IED [[blast wave]]s and PTSD. Dr. Perl was recruited to the faculty of the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] as a Professor of Pathology and to establish the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine mandated by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usuhs.edu/cnrm USUHS] Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine; Uniformed Services University; Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical use==
The [[Fougasse (weapon)|fougasse]] was improvised for centuries, eventually inspiring factory-made [[land mine]]s. [[Ernst Jünger]] mentions in his war memoir the systematic use of IEDs and [[booby trap]]s to cover the retreat of German troops at the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] region during the [[First World War]]. Another early example of coordinated large-scale use of IEDs was the [[Operation Bagration#Operations Rail War and Concert|Belarusian Rail War]] launched by Belarusian guerrillas against the Germans during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Afghanistan===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:3rd Battalion 3rd Marines controlled detonation.jpg|thumb|alt=Marines beside a mud wall as an explosion goes off behind it|U.S. Marines with Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) destroy an improvised explosive device cache in southern [[Afghanistan]] in June 2010.]]

Starting six months before the [[Soviet–Afghan War|invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]] by the [[USSR]] on 27 December 1979, the Afghan [[Mujahideen]] were supplied by the CIA, among others, with large quantities of military supplies. Among those supplies were many types of [[anti-tank mine]]s. The insurgents often removed the explosives from several foreign anti-tank mines, and combined the explosives in tin cooking-oil cans for a more powerful blast. By combining the explosives from several mines and placing them in tin cans, the insurgents made them more powerful, but sometimes also easier to detect by Soviet sappers using [[mine detector]]s. After an IED was detonated, the insurgents often used direct-fire weapons such as machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to continue the attack.

Afghan insurgents operating far from the border with [[Pakistan]] did not have a ready supply of foreign anti-tank mines. They preferred to make IEDs from Soviet unexploded ordnance. The devices were rarely triggered by pressure fuses. They were almost always remotely detonated. Since the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[Taliban]] and its supporters have used IEDs against [[NATO]] and Afghan military and civilian vehicles. This has become the most common method of attack against NATO forces, with IED attacks increasing consistently year on year.

According to a report by the [[Homeland Security Market Research]] in the US, the number of IEDs used in Afghanistan had increased by 400 percent since 2007 and the number of troops killed by them by 400 percent, and those wounded by 700 percent. It has been reported that IEDs are the number one cause of death among NATO troops in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afghanistan.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/06/combating-the-no-1-killer-of-troops-in-afghanistan/ |title=Combating the No. 1 killer of troops in Afghanistan |publisher=CNN |date=2010-05-06|accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brigade commander said that [[sniffer dogs]] are the most reliable way of detecting IEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/taliban-make-undetectable-bombs-out-of-wood-1863353.html |title=Taliban make 'undetectable' bombs out of wood |work=Independent |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, statistical evidence gathered by the US Army Maneuver Support Center at Fort Leonard Wood, MO shows that the dogs are not the most effective means of detecting IEDs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division was the first unit to introduce explosive detection dogs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriotdog.com/bomb-dog-services.html|title=Reliable Explosives Detection Dogs - Patriot K-9|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in southern Afghanistan. In less than two years the dogs discovered 15 tons of illegal munitions, IED's, and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;government contract GSO7F-5391P&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012 it was reported that "sticky bombs", magnetically adhesive IED's that were prevalent in the [[Iraq War]], showed up in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/afghanistan/sticky-bombs-like-those-used-in-iraq-now-appearing-in-afghanistan-1.183623|title=Sticky bombs, like those used in Iraq, now appearing in Afghanistan|work=Stars and Stripes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2012/07/23/Sticky-bombs-showing-up-in-Afghanistan/UPI-78641343049102/|title=Sticky bombs showing up in Afghanistan|publisher=UPI|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAF troops stationed in Afghanistan and other IED prone areas of operation would commonly "BIP" (blow in place) IED's and other explosives that were considered too dangerous to defuse.

===Iraq===
[[File:Size0-army mil-44434-2009-07-10-090719.jpg|thumb|A [[Stryker]] lies on its side following a buried IED blast in [[Iraq]]. (2007)]]
In the 2003–2011 [[Iraq War]], IEDs have been used extensively against [[Coalition force]]s and by the end of 2007 they have been responsible for at least 64% of Coalition deaths in Iraq.&lt;ref name="icasualties" /&gt;

Beginning in July 2003, the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]] used IEDs to target invading coalition vehicles. According to the [[Washington Post]], 64% of U.S. deaths in Iraq occurred due to IEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Post |date=September 30, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2007/09/28/GR2007092802161.html |title=More Attacks, Mounting Casualties |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French study&lt;ref name="Steinhofer"&gt;Jean-Pierre Steinhoffer :  " Irak :  les pertes de la Coalition par EEI ", in ''le Casoar'' January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  showed that in Iraq, from March 2003 to November 2006, on a global {{formatnum:3070}} deaths in the US-led invading coalition soldiers, {{formatnum:1257}} were caused by IEDs, i.e. 41%. That is to say more than in the "normal fights" (1027 dead, 34%). Insurgents now use the bombs to target not only invading coalition vehicles but Iraqi police as well.

Common locations for placing these bombs on the ground include animal [[Carrion|carcasses]], [[soft drink can]]s, and [[box]]es.  Typically they explode underneath or to the side of the vehicle to cause the maximum amount of damage; however, as [[vehicle armour]] was improved on military vehicles, insurgents began placing IEDs in elevated positions such as on [[traffic sign|road signs]], utility poles, or [[tree]]s, in order to hit less protected areas.

IEDs in Iraq may be made with [[artillery]] or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] [[projectile|shell]]s or with varying amounts of bulk or homemade [[explosive]]s.  Early during the Iraq war, the bulk explosives were often obtained from stored munitions bunkers to include stripping landmines of their explosives.

Despite the increased [[armor]], IEDs are killing military personnel and civilians with greater frequency. May 2007 was the deadliest month for IED attacks thus far, with a reported 89 of the 129 invading coalition casualties coming from an IED attack.&lt;ref name="icasualties"&gt;[http://icasualties.org/oif/IED.aspx iCasualties: OIF - Deaths by IED&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113201909/http://icasualties.org/oif/IED.aspx |date=January 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Pentagon, 250,000 tons (out of 650,000 tons total) of Iraqi heavy ordnance were looted, providing a large supply of ammunition for the insurgents.

In October 2005, the UK government charged that [[Iran]] was supplying insurgents with the technological know-how to make [[shaped charge]] IEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4312516.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Iran 'behind attacks on British' |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-10-05 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Iranian and Iraqi government officials denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4315924.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Blair warns Iran over Iraq bombs |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyjtimes.com/cover/11-11-05/IranWarnedNotToMeddle.htm |title=British Official Warns Iran Not to Meddle in Iraq |publisher=Nyjtimes.com |date=2004-06-08 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom/Republic of Ireland===
[[File:Home-made explosives packed in oil drums being dealt with by EOD Operator. MOD 45159058.jpg |thumb|left|Oil-drum roadside IED removed from culvert in 1984]]

Throughout [[The Troubles]], the [[Provisional IRA]] made extensive use of IEDs in their [[Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign|1969–97 campaign]]. They used [[barrack buster]] mortars and remote controlled IEDs. Members of the IRA developed and counter-developed devices and tactics. IRA bombs became highly sophisticated, featuring [[anti-handling device]]s such as a [[mercury switch|mercury tilt switch]] or [[microswitch]]es. These devices would [[detonate]] the bomb if it was moved in any way. Typically, the safety-arming device used was a clockwork [[Memopark timer]], which armed the bomb up to 60 minutes after it was placed&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Gareth; Pallister, David. ''Timer clue to Brighton bombing'', ''[[The Guardian]]''; 10 May 10, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; by completing an electrical circuit supplying power to the anti-handling device. Depending on the particular design (e.g., [[boobytrap]]ped [[briefcase]] or [[car bomb]]) an independent electrical circuit supplied power to a conventional timer set for the intended time delay, e.g. 40 minutes. However, some electronic delays developed by IRA technicians could be set to accurately detonate a bomb weeks after it was hidden, which is what happened in the [[Brighton hotel bombing|Brighton hotel bomb attack]] of 1984. Initially, bombs were detonated either by timer or by simple command wire. Later, bombs could be detonated by radio control. Initially, simple servos from [[radio-controlled aircraft]] were used to close the electrical circuit and supply power to the detonator. After the British developed jammers, IRA technicians introduced devices that required a sequence of [[Selective calling|pulsed radio codes]] to arm and detonate them. These were harder to jam.

Roadside bombs were extensively used by the IRA. Typically, a roadside bomb was placed in a drain or culvert along a rural road and detonated by remote control when British security forces vehicles were passing. As a result of the use of these bombs, the British military stopped transport by road in areas such as South Armagh, and used [[helicopter]] transport instead to avoid the danger.

Most IEDs used commercial or homemade explosives, although the use of [[Semtex]]-H smuggled in from [[Libya]] in the 1980s was also common from the mid-1980s onward. [[Bomb Disposal]] teams from [[321 EOD]] manned by [[Ammunition Technicians]] were deployed in those areas to deal with the IED threat. The IRA also used secondary devices to catch British reinforcements sent in after an initial blast as occurred in the [[Warrenpoint Ambush]]. Between 1970 and 2005, the IRA detonated 19,000 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the Northern Ireland and Britain, an average of one every 17 hours for three and a half decades, arguably making it "the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.ipcprintservices.com/display_article.php?id=177490|title=IRA TECHNOLOGY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, at the height of the IRA campaign, the [[British Army]] unit tasked with rendering safe IEDs, 321 EOD, sustained significant casualties while engaged in bomb disposal operations. This mortality rate was far higher than other high risk occupations such as deep sea diving, and a careful review was made of how men were selected for [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] operations. The review recommended bringing in [[psychometric]] testing of soldiers to ensure those chosen had the correct mental preparation for high risk bomb disposal duties.

The IRA came up with ever more sophisticated designs and deployments of IEDs. [[Booby Trap]] or Victim Operated IEDs (VOIEDs), became commonplace. The IRA engaged in an ongoing battle to gain the upper hand in electronic warfare with remote controlled devices. The rapid changes in development led 321 EOD to employ specialists from [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency|DERA]] (now [[Dstl]], an agency of the MOD), the [[Royal Signals]], and [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Military Intelligence]]. This approach by the British army to fighting the IRA in Northern Ireland led to the development and use of most of the modern weapons, equipment and techniques now used by EOD Operators throughout the rest of the world today.

The [[bomb disposal]] operations were led by [[Ammunition Technician]]s and [[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s from 321 EOD, and were trained at the [[Felix Centre]] at the [[Army School of Ammunition]].

===Lebanon===
The [[Lebanese National Resistance Front]], the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], other resistance groups in Lebanon, and later [[Hezbollah]], made extensive use of IEDs to resist [[Israel]]i forces after Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel withdrew from Beirut, Northern Lebanon, and Mount Lebanon in 1985, whilst maintaining its occupation of Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah frequently used IEDs to attack Israeli military forces in this area up until the Israeli withdrawal, and the liberation of Lebanon in May 2000.

One such bomb killed Israeli [[Brigadier General]] Erez Gerstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Essence of Longing: General Erez Gerstein and the War in Lebanon|publisher=Miskal&amp;nbsp;— Yedioth Ahronoth Books and Chemed Books|date=May 2007|first=Ehud|last=Eiran|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; on February 28, 1999, the highest-ranking Israeli to die in Lebanon since [[Yekutiel Adam]]'s death in 1982.

Also in the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 War in Lebanon]], a [[Merkava]] Mark II [[tank]] was hit by a pre-positioned [[Hezbollah]] IED, killing all 4 [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] servicemen on board,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Arkin  | first = William M.  | authorlink = William Arkin  | title = Divine Victory for Whom?

===Nepal===
IEDs were also widely used in the 10-years long civil war of the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoists]] in [[Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal|Nepal]], ranging from those bought from illicit groups in India and China, to self-made devices. Typically used devices were [[pressure cooker bomb]]s, socket bombs, pipe bombs, bucket bombs, etc. The devices were used more for the act of terrorizing the urban population rather than for fatal causes, placed in front of governmental offices, street corners or road sides. Mainly, the home-made IEDs were responsible for destruction of majority of structures targeted by the Maoists and assisted greatly in spreading terror among the public.

===United States===
In the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], [[Timothy McVeigh]] and [[Terry Nichols]] built an IED with [[ammonium nitrate|ammonium nitrate fertilizer]], [[nitromethane]], and stolen commercial explosives in a rental truck, with [[sandbag]]s used to concentrate the explosive force in the desired direction. McVeigh detonated it next to the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]], killing 168 people, 19 of whom were children.

In August 28, 2003, [[Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong]], and three people plotted to make [[Murder of Brian Wells|Brian Wells]] wear a fake collar bomb and rob a bank. What Wells did not know was that the plot was for him to wear a real bomb. When he met with the conspirators and was armed with the device, Wells stated that the bomb looked real and Diehl-Armstrong responded telling him it was. Wells tried to escape, but was recaptured by his accomplices. He was forced to go to the bank, where he demanded money, receiving only $8,702. Wells was arrestd by the police outside the bank and handcuffed, Wells said that he had a bomb on him, about 30 minutes later, 3 minutes before the bomb squad arrived Brian Wells was pronounced dead, from the explosive device he carried.

In January 2011, a [[2011 Spokane bombing attempt|shaped pipe bomb was discovered]] and defused at a [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] memorial march in [[Spokane, Washington]]. The FBI said that the bomb was specifically designed to cause maximum harm as the explosive device was, according to the ''Los Angeles Times'', packed with fishing weights covered in rat poison, and may have been racially motivated. No one was injured during the event.

On April 15, 2013, as the annual [[Boston Marathon]] race was concluding, two bombs were [[Boston Marathon bombing|detonated]] seconds apart close to the finish line. Initial FBI response indicated suspicion of IED [[pressure cooker bomb]]s.

On September 17–19, 2016, [[2016 New York and New Jersey bombings|several explosions]] occurred in [[Manhattan]] and [[New Jersey]]. The sources of the explosions were all found to be IEDs of various types, such as pressure cooker bombs and [[pipe bomb]]s.

Many IED-related arrests are made each year in circumstances where the plot was foiled before the device was deployed, or the device exploded but no one was injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/13/557629826/suspect-in-would-be-airport-bombing-nabbed-with-help-from-rei|title=Suspect In Would-Be Airport Bombing Nabbed With Help From REI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Grenade in a Can'' was a simple and effective [[booby trap]]. A [[hand grenade]] with the safety pin removed and safety lever compressed was placed into a container such as a tin can, with a length of string or [[tripwire]] attached to the grenade.  The can was fixed in place and the string was stretched across a path or doorway opening and firmly tied down.  In alternative fashion, the string could be attached to the moving portion of a door or gate. When the grenade was pulled out of the can by a person or vehicle placing tension on the string, the spring-loaded safety lever would release and the grenade would explode.

The ''rubber band grenade'' was another booby trap. To make this device, a Viet Cong guerrilla would wrap a strong [[rubber band]] around the spring-loaded safety lever of a hand grenade and remove the pin. The grenade was then hidden in a hut. American and [[South Vietnam]]ese soldiers would burn huts regularly to prevent them from being inhabited again, or to expose [[Defensive fighting position|foxholes]] and [[tunnel]] entrances, which were frequently concealed within these structures.  When a hut with the booby trap was torched, the rubber band on the grenade would melt, releasing the safety lever and blowing up the hut. This would often wound the soldiers with burning bamboo and metal fragments. This booby trap was also used to destroy vehicles when the modified grenade was placed in the fuel tank. The rubber band would be eaten away by the chemical action of the fuel, releasing the safety lever and detonating the grenade.

Another variant was the ''[[Antique fruit jar|Mason jar]] grenade.''  The safety pin of hand grenades would be pulled and the grenades would be placed in glass Ball Mason jars, which would hold back the safety lever.  The safety lever would release upon the shattering of the jar and the grenade would detonate.  This particular variant was popular with helicopter warfare, and were used as improvised anti-personnel cluster bombs during air raids.  They were easy to dump out of the flight door over a target, and the thick Ball Mason glass was resistant to premature shattering.  They could also be partially filled with gasoline or jellied gasoline, [[Napalm]], to add to their destructive nature.

===By warhead===
The ''Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms'' (JCS Pub 1-02) includes two definitions for improvised devices: improvised explosive devices (IED) and [[improvised nuclear device]] (IND).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |title=JP 1-02 Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123014953/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions address the ''Nuclear'' and ''Explosive'' in ''CBRNe''. That leaves chemical, biological and radiological undefined. Four definitions have been created to build on the structure of the JCS definition. Terms have been created to standardize the language of first responders and members of the military and to correlate the operational picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrneworld.com/images/CBRNe_WORLD.pdf |title=CBRNe World pages |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325102212/http://www.cbrneworld.com/images/CBRNe_WORLD.pdf |archivedate=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Explosive====
A device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It may incorporate military stores, but is normally devised from non-military components.&lt;ref name="AAP-6"/&gt;

====Explosively formed penetrator/projectiles (EFPs)====
[[File:Improvised explosive device explosively formed penetrator Iraq.jpg|thumb|upright|Improvised explosive device in Iraq. The [[wiktionary:Concave|concave]] [[copper]] shape on top defines an [[Explosively formed penetrator|explosively]] formed penetrator/projectile]]

IEDs have been deployed in the form of [[Explosively formed penetrator|explosively formed projectile]]s (EFP), a special type of [[shaped charge]] that is effective at long standoffs from the target (50 meters or more), however they are not accurate at long distances.  This is because of how they are produced.  The large "slug" projected from the explosion has no stabilization because it has no tail fins and it does not spin like a bullet from a rifle.  Without this stabilization the trajectory can not be accurately determined beyond 50 meters.  An EFP is essentially a cylindrical shaped charge with a machined concave metal disc (often copper) in front, pointed inward. The force of the shaped charge turns the disc into a high velocity slug, capable of penetrating the armor of most vehicles in Iraq.

====Directionally focused charges====
Directionally focused charges (also known as directionally focused fragmentary charges depending on the construction) are very similar to EFPs, with the main difference being that the top plate is usually flat and not concave. It also is not made with machined copper but much cheaper cast or cut metal. When made for fragmentation, the contents of the charge is usually nuts, bolts, ball bearings and other similar shrapnel products and explosive. If it only consists of the flat metal plate, it is known as a platter charge, serving a similar role as an EFP with reduced effect but easier construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FM 20-32 Chapter 13|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/20-32/chap13b.html|website=Global Security}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superbomb Mystery: The Herrhaussen Assassination|website=WIRED|publisher=https://www.wired.com/2008/07/the-assassinati/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chemical====
A device incorporating the toxic attributes of chemical materials designed to result in the dispersal of these toxic chemical materials for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon.

====Biological====
A device incorporating biological materials designed to result in the dispersal of vector borne biological material for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices are fabricated in a completely improvised manner.

====Incendiary====
A device making use of exothermic chemical reactions designed to result in the rapid spread of fire for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population or it may be used with the intent of gaining a tactical advantage. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon. A common type of this is the [[Molotov cocktail]].

====Radiological====
A speculative device incorporating radioactive materials designed to result in the dispersal of radioactive material for the purpose of area denial and economic damage, and/or for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing nuclear weapon. Also called a Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD) or "[[dirty bomb]]".

====Nuclear====
[[Improvised nuclear device]] of most likely [[Gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] or [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion-type]].

[[Nanotechnology]] can theoretically be used to develop miniaturised laser-triggered [[pure fusion weapon]] that will be easier to produce than conventional nuclear weapons and could be used in terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/17/mini-nukes-and-inspect-bot-weapons-being-primed-for-future-warfare.html|title=Mini-nukes and mosquito-like robot weapons being primed for future warfare|first=Jeff|last=Daniels|date=17 March 2017|website=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By delivery mechanism===

====Car====
{{Main|Car bomb}}
[[File:Iraq carbomb.jpg|thumb|[[Artillery shell]]s and [[gasoline]] cans discovered in the back of a pick-up truck in Iraq]]

A vehicle may be laden with explosives, set to explode by remote control or by a passenger/driver, commonly known as a [[car bombs|car bomb]] or vehicle-borne IED (VBIED, pronounced ''vee-bid''). On occasion the driver of the car bomb may have been coerced into delivery of the vehicle under duress, a situation known as a [[proxy bomb]]. Distinguishing features are low-riding vehicles with excessive weight, vehicles with only one passenger, and ones where the interior of the vehicles look as if they have been stripped down and built back up. Car bombs can carry thousands of pounds of explosives and may be augmented with [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] to increase fragmentation.  The U.S. State Department has published a guide on car bomb awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/When_broken_down_vehicles_go_boom!|title=When broken down vehicles go boom! - WikiLeaks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ISIS]] has used truck bombs with devastating effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW_F2ntQOcQ|title=Drone View Of New ISIS Car Bombs In The Battle For Mosul|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGIiD-uG4oE|title=ISIS Using Suicide Trucks To Destroy Iraqi Tanks (Mosul Battlefield)|first=|last=Non Mirage Truth Vision|date=22 November 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Havj9wD_-w|title=+18 - "Islamic State" jihadists' VBIED attacks - March 2017 - Mosul, Iraq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Boat====
Boats laden with explosives can be used against ships and areas connected to water. An early example of this type was the Japanese [[Shinyo (suicide boat)|Shinyo]] suicide boats during [[World War II]]. The boats were laden with explosives and attempted to ram Allied ships, sometimes successfully, having sunk or severely damaged several American ships by war's end. Suicide bombers used a boat-borne IED to attack the [[USS Cole bombing|USS Cole]], US and UK troops have also been killed by boat-borne IEDs in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Steinhofer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6146844.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Iraq boat attack personnel named |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animal====
{{Main|Animal-borne bomb attacks}}

Monkeys and [[war pig]]s were used as incendiaries around 1000 AD. More famously the "[[anti-tank dog]]" and "[[bat bomb]]" were developed during World War II. In recent times, a two-year-old child and seven other people were killed by explosives strapped to a horse in the town of Chita in [[Colombia]]&lt;ref name="horsebomb"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3098746.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; 'Horse bomb' hits Colombia town |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-09-11 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carcasses of certain animals were also used to conceal explosive devices by the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/ied-iraq.htm Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) -Iraq] GlobalSecurity.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collar====
IEDs strapped to the necks of farmers have been used on at least three occasions by guerrillas in Colombia, as a way of extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3036664.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Experts defuse necklace bomb |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-07-01 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/751237.stm |title=AMERICAS &amp;#124; 'Necklace' bomb halts Colombia talks |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-05-16 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[pizza delivery]] man [[Brian Douglas Wells]] was killed in 2003 by an explosive fastened to his neck, purportedly under duress from the maker of the bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =John | last =Caniglia | authorlink = | date =July 11, 2007 | title ="Brian Wells" Erie bombing 'victim' was in on bank robbery | journal =Plain Dealer | volume = | issue = | pages = | id = | url = http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2007/07/man_forced_to_rob_bank_with_a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a schoolgirl in Sydney, Australia had a [[Mosman bomb hoax|suspected collar bomb attached to her]] by an attacker in her home. The device was removed by police after a ten-hour operation and proved to be a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bomb-device-attached-to-mosman-schoolgirl-was-a-very-very-elaborate-hoax-20110804-1icbe.html|title='Bomb' device attached to Mosman schoolgirl was a 'very, very elaborate hoax'|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=4 August 2011|date=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suicide====
[[Suicide bombing]] usually refers to an individual wearing explosives and detonating them in order to kill others including themselves, a technique pioneered by [[LTTE]] (Tamil Tigers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acd.iiss.org/armedconflict/Mainpages/dsp_ConflictBackground.asp?ConflictID=174 |title=IISS Armed Conflict Database |publisher=Acd.iiss.org |accessdate=2009-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112100340/http://acd.iiss.org/armedconflict/Mainpages/dsp_ConflictBackground.asp?ConflictID=174 |archivedate=2009-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bomber will conceal explosives on and around their person, commonly using a vest (or possibly a prosthetic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DHS Warns Of Pregnant Prosthetic Belly Bombings|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=9a4_1202868059}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and will use a timer or some other trigger to detonate the explosives. The logic behind such attacks is the belief that an IED delivered by a human has a greater chance of achieving success than any other method of attack. In addition, there is the psychological impact of fighters prepared to deliberately sacrifice themselves for their cause.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;

=====Surgically implanted=====
{{Main|Surgically implanted explosive device}}
In May 2012 American [[counter-terrorism]] officials leaked their acquisition of documents describing the preparation and use of surgically implanted improvised explosive devices.&lt;ref name=DailyBeast2012-05-14&gt;

====Robot====
Robots can be used to carry explosives.

====Improvised Rocket====
{{Main|Lob bomb}}

In 2008, rocket-propelled IEDs, dubbed ''Improvised Rocket Assisted Munitions'', ''Improvised Rocket Assisted Mortars'' and ''(IRAM)'' by the military, came to be employed in numbers against U.S. forces in Iraq. They have been described as [[propane]] tanks packed with explosives and powered by [[List of artillery by type#Rocket artillery|107 mm rockets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Troops in Iraq Face A Powerful New Weapon: Use of Rocket-Propelled Bombs Spreads|first=Ernesto|last=Londoño|publisher=Washington Post|date=July 10, 2008|page=A01|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/09/AR2008070902396_pf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to some Provisional IRA [[barrack buster]] mortars.

Improvised mortar has been used by many insurgent groups including during civil war in Syria and Boko Haram insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wEEovjWZZk|title=Syria: Innovations for freedom #3  more DIY trebuchets, pipe weapons and vehicles|first=|last=lisa ann|date=4 May 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRA used improvised mortars called [[barrack buster]]s.

==== Improvised Artillery ====
Improvised artillery including ''[[hell cannon]]s'' are used by rebel forces during Syrian Civil War.

===By trigger mechanism===

====Wire====
Command-wire improvised, explosive devices (CWIED) use an electrical firing cable that affords the user complete control over the device right up until the moment of initiation.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunter | first = Major Chris | authorlink =  | title = Eight Lives Down | publisher = Corgi Books | year = 2008 | location = London | isbn = 978-0-552-15571-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radio====
The trigger for a [[Radio control|radio-controlled]] improvised explosive device (RCIED) is controlled by radio link. The device is constructed so that the receiver is connected to an electrical firing circuit and the transmitter operated by the perpetrator at a distance. A signal from the transmitter causes the receiver to trigger a firing pulse that operates the switch. Usually the switch fires an initiator; however, the output may also be used to remotely arm an explosive circuit. Often the transmitter and receiver operate on a matched [[Selective calling|coding system]] that prevents the RCIED from being initiated by spurious radio frequency signals or [[Radio jamming|jamming]].&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt; An RCIED can be triggered from any number of different mechanisms including car alarms, wireless door bells, cell phones, [[pager]]s and encrypted [[General Mobile Radio Service|GMRS radios]].&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;

====Mobile phone====
A radio-controlled IED (RCIED) incorporating a [[mobile phone]] that is modified and connected to an electrical firing circuit. Mobile phones operate in the UHF band in line of sight with [[base transceiver station]] (BTS) antennae sites. In the common scenario, receipt of a paging signal by phone is sufficient to initiate the IED firing circuit.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;

====Victim-operated====
Victim-operated improvised explosive devices (VOIED), also known as [[booby trap]]s, are designed to function upon contact with a victim. VOIED switches are often well hidden from the victim or disguised as innocuous everyday objects. They are operated by means of movement. Switching methods include tripwire, pressure mats, spring-loaded release, push, pull or tilt. Common forms of VOIED include the under-vehicle IED (UVIED), improvised [[landmine]]s, and [[Letter bomb|mail bombs]].&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;

====Infrared====
The British accused Iran and [[Hezbollah]] of teaching Iraqi fighters to use [[infrared]] light beams to trigger IEDs. As the occupation forces became more sophisticated in interrupting radio signals around their convoys, the insurgents adapted their triggering methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2007/June/BombMakingSkills.htm "Bomb Making Skills Spread Globally", ''National Defense'' magazine, June 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814021913/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2007/June/BombMakingSkills.htm |date=August 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, when a more advanced method was disrupted, the insurgents regressed to using uninterruptible means, such as hard wires from the IED to detonator; however, this method is much harder to effectively conceal. It later emerged however, that these "advanced" IEDs were actually old [[Provisional IRA|IRA]] technology. The infrared beam method was perfected by the IRA in the early '90s after it acquired the technology from a botched undercover British Army operation. Many of the IEDs being used against the invading coalition forces in [[Iraq]] were originally developed by the British Army who unintentionally passed the information on to the IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/ulster/article320004.ece | title=Revealed: IRA bombs killed eight British soldiers in Iraq, '&amp;#39;This Britain'&amp;#39;, UK&amp;nbsp;— Independent.co.uk | publisher=News.independent.co.uk | date=2005-10-16 | accessdate=2009-10-18 | location=London | first1=Greg | last1=Harkin | first2=Francis | last2=Elliott | first3=Raymond | last3=Whitaker | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709005403/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/ulster/article320004.ece | archivedate=2008-07-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA taught their techniques to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the knowledge spread to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Independent.ie |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-death-of-the-tank-took-place-around-crossmaglen-2131116.html |title=independent.ie |publisher=independent.ie |date= 2010-04-09|accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Counter-IED efforts}}
Counter-IED efforts are done primarily by military, law enforcement, diplomatic, financial, and intelligence communities and involve a comprehensive approach to countering the threat networks that employ IEDs, not just efforts to defeat the devices themselves.

===Detection and disarmament===
Because the components of these devices are being used in a manner not intended by their manufacturer, and because the method of producing the explosion is limited only by the science and imagination of the perpetrator, it is not possible to follow a step-by-step guide to detect and disarm a device that an individual has only recently developed. As such, [[bomb disposal|explosive ordnance disposal]] (IEDD) operators must be able to fall back on their extensive knowledge of the first principles of [[explosives]] and [[ammunition]], to try and deduce what the perpetrator has done, and only then to [[render safe procedure|render it safe]] and dispose of or exploit the device. Beyond this, as the stakes increase and IEDs are emplaced not only to achieve the direct effect, but to deliberately target IEDD operators and cordon personnel, the IEDD operator needs to have a deep understanding of tactics to ensure he is neither setting up any of his team or the cordon troops for an attack, nor walking into one himself. The presence of [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], [[radioactivity|radiological]], or [[radioactivity|nuclear]] ([[CBRN]]) material in an IED requires additional precautions. As with other missions, the EOD operator provides the area commander with an assessment of the situation and of support needed to complete the mission.

Military and law enforcement personnel from around the world have developed a number of [[render safe procedure|render-safe procedure]]s (RSPs) to deal with IEDs.  RSPs may be developed as a result of direct experience with devices or by applied research designed to counter the threat. The supposed effectiveness of IED jamming systems, including vehicle- and [[Thor III|personally-mounted]] systems, has caused IED technology to essentially regress to command-wire detonation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/an-vlq-9.htm |title=Warlock Green / Warlock Red / AN/VLQ -9 or -10 SHORTSTOP Countermeasure |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are physical connections between the detonator and explosive device and cannot be jammed. However, these types of IEDs are more difficult to emplace quickly, and are more readily detected.

Military forces and law enforcement from [[India]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Spain]], and the [[United States]] are at the forefront of counter-IED efforts, as all have direct experience in dealing with IEDs used against them in conflict or terrorist attacks. From the research and development side, programs such as the new Canadian Unmanned Systems Challenge will bring student groups together to invent an unmanned device to both locate IEDs and pinpoint the insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unlimitedmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=504&amp;ed=15&amp;cat=14 |title=Messenger, Scott (2009-03-01).

[[File:KestrelTrustSeal.png|right|170px|The Kestrel Trust]]

Founded in 1970, the '''Kestrel Land Trust''' is a land [[Conservation movement|conservation]] organization based in Amherst which works to conserve farmland, forests, fields and rivers from development in the [[Pioneer Valley]] of Western [[Massachusetts]]. Like most [[land trust]]s, the Kestrel Land Trust depends on private donors to leverage state money. By working with landowners, town conservation commissions, state agencies, and other land trusts Kestrel has conserved thousands of [[acres]] in the region they serve.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

==Merger with Valley Land Fund==

In the Spring of 2011, Kestrel merged with the Valley Land Fund, another land trust based in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. As part of the merger, Kestrel expanded its service area range from nine to nineteen towns in order to include those areas served by Valley Land Fund.

==5K Run for Farmland==

The Kestrel Land Trust annually hosts a 5K run and 2 Mile walk in late October to fundraise for land conservation. Racers begin on the Hadley Commons area and then run a fast, flat course through historic Hadley farmland before ending once again on the Commons. Prizes donated by local businesses are given to the overall male and female winners, as well as the winners of each age group. 

In 2011, the event was expanded to include a farmer's market and festival following the race. Approximately 10 local farmers and artisans set up booths and sold their goods, while local Irish-music band Banish Misfortune played. Additionally, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] presented their family-friendly Watershed on Wheels educational exhibit and Tom Ricardi showed rehabilitated birds. Over 500 people ran or shopped at the 2011 5K for Farmland and Farmer's Market Festival.

==Brushy Mountain Conservation Restriction==

On December 23, 2011, [[Massachusetts Energy and Environmental Affairs]](EEA) Secretary Richard K. Sullivan Jr. announced that 3,486 acres owned by W.D. Cowls, Inc. would be protected through a conservation restriction. This land conservation deal, arranged by the Kestrel Land Trust with partners Department of Fish and Game (DFG), Franklin Land Trust, and W.D. Cowls, Inc. is the largest land protection deal done in Massachusetts since the 1920s and the largest conservation restriction ever done in the state. This Conservation Restriction will guarantee public access for recreation, conserve wildlife habitat, and promote sustainable forestry.

With a rated power of 1400MW, the '''Kii Channel HVDC system''' in [[Japan]] is, as of 2012, the highest-capacity [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) [[submarine power cable]] system in the world to use a single bipole.  The [[HVDC Cross-Channel|cross channel]] system between England and France has a larger total capacity, but uses two bipoles rated at 1000MW each.

The [[Kii Channel]] HVDC system connects the Anan [[static inverter plant]], located south of Tachibana Power Plant, at {{coord|33|49|40|N|134|38|14|E|type:landmark_region:JP|display=inline|name=Anan Static Inverter Plant}} on the [[Japanese Home Islands|Japanese Home Island]] of [[Shikoku]], with the inverter plant at [[Kihoku, Mie|Kihoku]] ( coordinates: {{coord|34|12|50|N|135|30|07|E|type:landmark_region:JP|display=inline|name=Kihoku Static Inverter Plant}}) on the largest of the Home Islands,  [[Honshu]].

== History ==
The first stage of this project went in service in the year 2000 with a bipolar voltage of 250 [[kilovolt]]s (kV) and rated to carry 1400 [[megawatt]]s (MW). A second-stage upgrade to 500kV has been planned from the outset and the HV cable, DC switchgear and DC reactor are already rated for the higher voltage, but as of 2012 the upgrade has not been put into effect.

The project contained several "firsts" when it was originally built, including:&lt;ref&gt;Shimato, T., Hashimoto, T. Sampei, M., The Kii Channel HVDC Link in Japan. CIGRE.  Paris, 2002, Paper 14-106.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Kii Channel HVDC system was the first HVDC project to use Gas-Insulated Switchgear (GIS) on the HVDC side
* The thyristor valves, built by [[Hitachi]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Mitsubishi]], used 150mm diameter [[thyristor#Light triggered thyristor|light triggered thyristor]]s.  At the time these were the largest thyristors ever made, and it was another 10 years thyristors of such large diameter were used again, in the Lingbao 2 and Xiangjiaba - Shanghai HVDC projects in [[China]].

The first 50 kilometers of the transmission line run north from the Anan inverter station as an undersea cable. At Yura ( coordinates: {{coord|33|58|37|N|135|05|20|E|type:landmark_region:JP|display=inline|name=Yura Switching Station}} ) there is a switching station, and from there the HVDC line runs for another 50&amp;nbsp;km as an [[overhead power line]].

'''AB Lietuvos dujos''' was a [[natural gas]] company in [[Lithuania]]. It was established in 1961 as an integrated gas company for import, transmission, distribution and sales of natural gas. After privatization in 1990s, its major shareholders became [[Gazprom]] and [[E.ON Ruhrgas]]. In 2013, its transmission business was spin-off into a separate company [[Amber Grid]]. In 2014, Gazprom and E.ON sold their stakes to the state-owned energy company [[Lietuvos Energija]]. On 1 January 2016, Lietuvos Dujos was merged into [[Energijos Skirstymo Operatorius]].&lt;ref name=delfi310816&gt;

The '''March 18–20, 1956 nor'easter''' was a significant [[winter storm]] in the [[United States]] that affected the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] and southern [[New England]]. The storm ranked as Category 1, or "notable", on the [[Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale]].&lt;ref name="NESIS"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=The Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS)|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 18, 2010|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/nesis.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[high-pressure area]] north of [[New York State]], developing in the wake of another system on March 15–16, provided cold air for the snowfall.&lt;ref name="Kocin"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; It was among a series of snowstorms to affect the region during the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Conrad P. Mook and Kenneth S. Norquest|title=The Heavy Snowstorm of March 18–19, 1956|year=March 1956|publisher=U.S. Weather Bureau|url=ftp://ftp.library.noaa.gov/docs.lib/htdocs/rescue/mwr/084/mwr-084-03-0116.pdf|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial low pressure center moved southeastward into the [[Ohio Valley]] as a weak cyclone between March and March 17. As it approached the [[U.S. East Coast]], a secondary low formed over [[Virginia]] on March 18 and gradually intensified. The primary storm dissipated shortly thereafter, and the new low emerged over the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] as it drifted northeastward. It intensified to reach a minimum barometric pressure of 1000 [[millibars]] before moving out of the region.&lt;ref name="Kocin"/&gt;

Precipitation began late on March 18 and ended across southern New England late the next day. Areas of northern [[New Jersey]], southern [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Massachusetts]] received snowfall totals exceeding {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}}.

==Travels==
Enrico Fermi built the first nuclear reactor ([[Chicago Pile-1]]) in an abandoned squash court at the [[University of Chicago]]. He ran the historic experiment for 28 minutes. In April 2009 artist Matthew Day Jackson invited Olivia to participate in a ceremonial game of squash. Jackson and the younger Fermi’s game tied “the physics of a squash ball to the physics of the first nuclear reactor”;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Snodgrass, [http://www.lamonitor.com/content/fermi-descendant-visits-filming “Fermi Descendant Visits for Filming”], “The Los Alamos Monitor Online”, 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was filmed in Los Alamos, New Mexico and displayed in a 28–minute video loop at the [[List Visual Arts Center|M.I.T. List Visual Arts Center]] and the [[Contemporary Arts Museum Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Britt, [http://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Review-Artist-explores-human-consciousness-1704916.php “Artist Explores Human Consciousness”], ‘’Houston Chronicle’’, 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
Jackson also filmed Olivia’s visit to [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] in Southern New Mexico, location of the first atomic bomb test on July 16, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Snodgrass,[http://www.lamonitor.com/content/fermi-descendant-visits-filming “Fermi Descendant Visits for Filming”], ‘’The Los Alamos Monitor Online’’, 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2011, for the 110th anniversary of Enrico Fermi’s birth, she visited her grandfather's former lab at [[Via Panisperna boys|Via Panisperna]] in Rome, where Enrico conducted his Nobel Prize–winning research.&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Schaeffer,[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2011/43/News%20Articles/1391734?ln=en “A F(e)rmidable Family”] ‘’The Bulletin’’, 24 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the site of Centro Fermi: Enrico Fermi Historical Museum of Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centro Fermi: Enrico Fermi Historical Museum of Physics and Study and Research Centre|url=http://www.centrofermi.it/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 Olivia visited [[CERN]] in Geneva, Switzerland. She toured various key experimental areas including the CERN Control Centre, [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], the SM18 magnet test facility, and [[On-Line Isotope Mass Separator|ISOLDE]]; met with [[Nobel prize in physics|Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist and former director of CERN [[Carlo Rubbia]]; and joined in a discussion with CERN’s ConCERNed for Humanity Club founders and guests.&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Schaeffer,[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2011/43/News%20Articles/1391734?ln=en “A F(e)rmidable Family”] ‘’The Bulletin’’, 24 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Her visit to Richland, WA in 2012 drew the interest of scientists, students and environmental activists who came to her talk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation looks at key questions from Nuclear Age|url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/hanford/article32085657.html|website=Tri-City Herald|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and workshops. She travelled to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in November 2014 extending her dialogue project to speaking with atomic bomb survivors including Toshiko Tanaka and artist who promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanazaki|first1=Yumi|title=Granddaughter of scientist involved in developing atomic bombs visits Hiroshima and Nagasaki|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/?p=38245|website=Chugoku Shimbun: Hiroshima Peace Media Center|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public events==
Fermi has given Neutron Trail talks in the US, Canada and Europe. On Jan 19, 2012, she gave a talk sponsored by the [[United Nations Association in Canada]] titled “Positioning Change and Global Nuclear Disarmament.” She presented personal stories of activists, images and timelines of individuals championing the nuclear disarmament movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unavancouver.wordpress.com/tag/olivia-fermi/ “On the Neutron Trail: Positioning Change and Global Nuclear Disarmament”], ‘’United Nations Association –Vancouver’’, 23 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[TED (conference)|TEDx]] Transmedia Talk in Rome on September 30, 2011 entitled “Becoming the Inspiration We Seek – The Alchemy of Opposites.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c4d59w4eZY “TEDxTransmedia 2011 – Olivia Fermi – Becoming the inspiration we seek”], ‘’TEDx YouTube Channel’’, 18 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; is about the power of embracing contradictions, especially those inherent in our nuclear legacy, such as the thrill of discovery commingled with the pride and shame of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings]]. It includes a photograph of her grandfather Enrico Fermi, with physicist [[Edward Teller]], holding an image of the Hiroshima bomb cloud.

On March 21, 2011, [[BBC World Service|BBC World Radio]] contacted Fermi to give an interview regarding the crisis — then taking place — at the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima 1 Nuclear Power Plant]] in Japan. During the five-minute interview, she spoke about her position on nuclear energy and the Neutron Trail.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Damon, [http://neutrontrail.com/2011/03/bbc-world-radio-interview-with-olivia-fermi/ “BBC World Radio Interview”], 21 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
On April 15, 2011, Olivia was the keynote speaker for the Society of Italian Researchers and Professionals of Western Canada’s inaugural meeting. This Neutron Trail talk was about her grandparents’ lives with personal anecdotes and archival images. During the question and answer period, she offered her opinions on the Fukushima Daiichi disaster: “Today we need nuclear power, and the challenge is to make it safe.”&lt;ref&gt;Nigel S. Lockyer, [http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/04/15/olivia-fermi-talks-on-the-neutron-trail/ “Quantum Diaries”], 15 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Windpark Egmond aan Zee''' (OWEZ) is the first large scale offshore [[wind farm]] built off the Dutch [[North Sea]] coast. It consists of 36&amp;nbsp;[[Vestas V90-3MW]] [[wind turbine]]s, each with [[nameplate capacity]] of 3&amp;nbsp;MW. In total the farm has a capacity of 108&amp;nbsp;MW. Together these are scaled to provide energy for a maximum of 100,000&amp;nbsp;households.

==Location and size==
The wind farm is located {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the coasts of [[Egmond aan Zee]] and is visible from the shore. Size of the farm is a projected {{convert|27|km²|sqmi}}. It was built by a consortium of [[Ballast Nedam]] and wind turbine manufacturers [[Vestas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oilvoice.com/n/Shell_Begins_Construction_at_Egmond_aan_Zee_Offshore_Wind_Farm/f2f5e37a.aspx Shell Begins Construction at Egmond aan Zee Offshore Wind Farm] Oil Voice, 20 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oreichthys''''' is a [[genus]] of tropical [[Barb (fish)|barbs]] found in [[Thailand]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma|Myanmar (Burma)]], northern [[Malay Peninsula]], and the [[Mekong]] basin in [[Laos]]. They are found in ditches, ponds, streams (both highland and lowland) and canals.&lt;ref name="Rahman, A.K.A. 1989"&gt;Rahman, A.K.A. (1989): Freshwater fishes of Bangladesh. [[Zoological Society of Bangladesh]]. Department of Zoology, University of Dhaka. 364 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The genus ''Oreichthys'' (Smith 1933) was originally established to receive little fish collected in a small brook on Kao Sabap, an extensive mountain range near [[Chantaban]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;The Freshwater fishes of Siam, or Thailand by Hugh M. Smith. United States National Museum Bulletin 188. 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==
There are currently 7 recognized species in this genus:
* ''[[Oreichthys andrewi]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[J. D. Marcus Knight|Knight]], 2014&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name=Knight2014&gt;Knight, J.D.M.

* ''[[Oreichthys parvus]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[Hugh McCormick Smith|H. M. Smith]], 1933&lt;/small&gt;

==Physical description==
All ''Oreichthys'', with the exception of ''O. crenuchoides'', possess a triangular-looking body, with the face being pointed. In ''O. crenuchoides'', the body and face are more rounded. The last simple dorsal ray is flexible and smooth. Scale count is 23 in the lengthwise series and 7 in the transverse series. The tube-bearing scales of the lateral line are restricted to the first 6 or 7 scales anteriorly. The head is marked by numerous fine rows of pores, mostly in parallel  groups on the snout, cheeks, interorbital space, and operuclar bones. Barbels are absent.

==Distribution==
Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar (Burma), northern Malay Peninsula, and the Mekong basin in Laos.

==Habitat==
''Oreichthys'' are found in ditches, ponds, streams (both highland and lowland) and canals.&lt;ref name="Rahman, A.K.A. 1989"/&gt;

==Aquarium Maintenance==
All ''Oreichthys'' species are easily maintained in aquaria. They are generally peaceful towards conspecifics and tankmates, even where the other fish may be smaller than they are. They appear to prefer cooler water temperatures, with 76&amp;nbsp;°F appearing to be the short-term upper limit unless auxiliary aeration is provided. They will feed on flake food, micro-pellets, frozen bloodworms, frozen mysis shrimp, and gelatin diet. All in all they are not fussy feeders, and adapt readily to captivity.
pH should range from neutral to slightly alkaline with moderate water hardness.

The '''orthobaric density''' of a compound is the [[density]] of coexisting [[phase (matter)|phases]] ([[liquid]], [[gas]], or [[solid]]) at a given [[temperature]].  

==Liquid - Gas Equilibrium==
For any temperature below the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], the density of the gas will be less than that of the liquid.  At the critical point, the density of the liquid and gas phases are identical and the compound becomes a [[supercritical fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;McQuarrie, Donald A. and Siman, John D., ''Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach''.

'''Pinolenic acid''' (often misspelled as '''pinoleic acid''') is a [[fatty acid]] contained in [[Siberian Pine]] nuts, [[Korean Pine]] nuts and the [[seed]]s of other pines ([[Pinus]] species). The highest percentage of pinolenic acid is found in Siberian [[pine nut]]s and the [[Vegetable fats and oils|oil]] produced from them.

Pinolenic acid is formally designated as ''all-cis-5,9,12-18:3''.&lt;ref name=cyberlipid&gt;{{cite web

Pinolenic acid is an [[isomer]] of [[gamma-linolenic acid]] (GLA).  GLA is an ω-6 [[essential fatty acid]] (EFA) but pinolenic acid is not.  However, like the EFAs, it forms biologically active [[Metabolomics|metabolites]] in the presence of [[cyclooxygenase]] or [[lipoxygenase]].

[[File:Pyrography The White Horse.jpg|thumb|300px|The White Horse, pyrography on [[Populus|poplar]].]]
'''Pyrography''' or '''pyrogravure''' is the art of decorating wood or other materials with burn marks resulting from the controlled application of a heated object such as a [[Fireplace poker|poker]]. It is also known as '''pokerwork''' or '''wood burning'''.

The term means "writing with fire", from the Greek ''pur'' (fire) and ''graphos'' (writing).&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Podgorski; ''Before You Pick Up That Nib: Wood Burning 101'', p7 {{ISBN|978-0-557-05114-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be practiced using specialized modern pyrography tools, or using a metal implement heated in a fire, or even sunlight concentrated with a magnifying [[lens (optics)|lens]].  "Pyrography dates from the 17th century and reached its highest standard in the 19th century. In its crude form it is pokerwork." &lt;ref&gt;"Pyrography." Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. London: Chambers Harrap, 2012. Credo Reference. Web. 2 Mar 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large range of tones and shades can be achieved. Varying the type of tip used, the temperature, or the way the iron is applied to the material all create different effects. After the design is burned in, wooden objects are often coloured. Light-coloured [[hardwoods]] such as [[sycamore]], [[basswood]], [[beech]] and [[birch]] are most commonly used, as their fine [[grain]] is not obtrusive. However, other woods, such as maple, [[pine]] or [[oak]], are also used. Pyrography is also applied to leather items, using the same hot-iron technique. [[Leather]] lends itself to bold designs, and also allows very subtle shading to be achieved. Specialist vegetable-tanned leather must be used for pyrography (as modern [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] methods leave chemicals in the leather which are [[toxic]] when burned), typically in light colours for good contrast.

Pyrography is also popular among [[gourd]] crafters and artists, where designs are burned onto the exterior of a dried hard-shell gourd.

== History ==
[[File:The Tawny Eagle.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Tawny Eagle. Davide Della Noce pyrography.]]
The process has been practiced by a number of cultures including the [[Egypt]]ians and some [[Africa]]n tribes since the dawn of recorded history. Pyrographer Robert Boyer hypothesises that the art form dates back to prehistory, when early humans created designs using the charred remains of their fires.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, R; ''The Amazing Art of Pyrography'', Evanston 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-879260-12-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known in China from the time of the [[Han dynasty]], where it was known as "Fire Needle Embroidery".&lt;ref&gt;[http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions1930.html China Culture - pyrography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906032848/http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions1930.html |date=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Victorian era]], the invention of pyrography machines sparked a widespread interest in the craft, and it was at this time that the term "pyrography" was coined (previously the name "pokerwork" had been most widely used)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkaboutcrafts.com/crafttopics/crafts/pyrography.htm Walkabout Crafts - pyrography]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, a [[Melbourne]] [[architect]] by the name of [[Alfred Smart]] discovered that water-based [[paint]] could be applied hot to wood by pumping [[benzoline]] fumes through a heated hollow [[platinum]] [[pencil]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Julie; ''With Mellow Shades and Character Made: The Richness of Australian Pokerwork'' in ''Carter's Antiques and Collectables Magazine'', Sept 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This improved the pokerwork process by allowing the addition of tinting and [[shading]] that were previously impossible. In the early 20th century, the development of the electric pyrographic hot wire wood etching machine further automated the pokerwork process, and [[Art Nouveau]] pyrographic gloveboxes and other works were popular in that era. Pyrography is a traditional folk art in many parts of Europe, including [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and [[Flanders]], as well as [[Argentina]] and other areas in [[South America]].

==Equipment==
Traditional pyrography can be performed using any heated metal implement. Modern pyrography machines exist, and can be divided into three main categories.

===Solid-point burners===
Solid-point burners are similar in design to a [[soldering iron]]. They have a solid brass tip which is heated by an electrical element, and operate at a fixed temperature.

===Wire-nib burners===
Wire-nib burners have variable temperature controls. The writing nib is heated by an electric current passing directly through it. Some models have interchangeable nibs to allow for different effects.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, S; ''Pyrography Workbook: A Complete Guide to the Art of Woodburning'' Fox Chapel 2005 p13-14 {{ISBN|978-1-56523-258-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser cutters===
[[Laser cutter]]s can be set to scorch the material instead of cutting all the way through it.  Many laser cutters provide software facilities to import image files and transfer them onto a sheet of wood.  Some laser systems are sufficiently sensitive to perform pyrography on thin card or even paper.

=== Woods === 
Woods differ in hardness, grain, figure, texture, color, and other physical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Nanette. "Woodburning Project &amp; Pattern Treasury: Create Your Own Pyrography Art With 70 Mix-And-Match Designs." Library Journal 137.4 (2012): 96. Academic Search Complete. Web. 2 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Hardness:''' All woods can be classified into hard or soft. Usually softwoods are from coniferous (needle-leaved) trees. You may be aware of a little bit of resin oozing and also, a slight turpentine smell when you burn on softwood. 

Hardwoods are from broad-leaved trees. These hardwood trees can be classified into two distinct growing seasons each year (hot and cold season or a wet and dry season) such as:
* Earlywood: normally lighter in color and weight and only moderately strong
* Latewood: usually heavier, darker, and stronger. 

Softwood will burn faster than a hardwood does. It does not require as hot a pen to burn as do the hardwoods. 

'''Grain:''' Grain is the direction of the fibrous elements of the wood cells. This is important to sand with the grain. Also the grain can cause deviation from its intended path with use of woodturning pen unless you apply more pressure and burn slower on the grain.

'''Figure:''' This is the natural design, or pattern, that you can see on the cut surface of the wood. The figure present on the wood should always be taken into consideration when you are planning your woodburned design. 

'''Texture:''' There is a texture on the surface of that wood that feels either coarse of fine, even or uneven. 

As a beginning woodburner, avoid using very fine or intricate designs on uneven, coarse-textured wood. Softwoods are more apt to be fine or moderately coarse-textured. With some textures it may mean that you will have to compensate when burning it – going slower on the harder summerwood, faster and with a lighter touch on the softer springwood to create an even burn overall.

'''Color:''' Woodburning should be mainly used to enhance the natural beauty of a wooden project, so do not always hide a beautiful figure, grain, luster, or color if it is present.

== Safety ==
The main hazard to be wary of is the extremely fine wood dust when sanding the wood or in some cases the pitch/sap or resin that emits harmful fumes when burning. All wood dust is hazardous &amp; can cause respiratory problems if you do not wear a mask, some more than others &amp; should be avoided. You should always wear a quality dust mask/respirator while power carving, and use a good dust collection system to avoid a lifetime injury to your lungs. These recommendations really are not just for power carving or sanding, but they should be used for burning as well. Remember:
* '''DO NOT''' burn on pressure-treated wood. It is treated with chemicals that, although safely bound in the wood fibers for construction purposes, are inherently dangerous to woodworkers and woodburners.
* '''DO NOT''' burn on any type of treated wood: Chemically treated, stained, painted, sealed with a finish, etc.  If you  must use this type of wood be sure that you have thoroughly sanded it to remove all traces and are burning on '''bare''' wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pyrography Materials and Safety Precautions|url = http://www.sawdustconnection.com/Pyrography-101-Tutorial-Pyrography-Safety.htm|website = www.sawdustconnection.com|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prepared Wood, Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF), man made boards and plywood should never really ever be burned on for several reasons. Prepared wood usually has been chemically treated and burning on it will release toxins into the air. MDF is made out of toxic materials and may cause cancer and other health issues. Man-made boards and such also have layers of glue that releases toxins that may not cause immediate harm but impact one later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lesson 2: A word about safety in Pyrography|url = http://hippiescreations.com/a-word-about-safety-in-pyrography/|website = The Art of Handmade|accessdate = 2015-10-19|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox ruthenium|phase=solid}}

'''Ruthenium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ru''' and [[atomic number]] 44. It is a rare [[transition metal]] belonging to the [[platinum group]] of the [[periodic table]]. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals. Russian-born scientist of Baltic-German ancestry [[Karl Ernst Claus]] discovered the element in 1844 at [[Kazan State University]] and named it after the Latin name of his homeland, ''[[Ruthenia]]''. Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of [[platinum]] ores; the annual production has risen from about 19 [[tonne]]s in 2009 &lt;ref name=JMM&gt;[http://www.platinum.matthey.com/services/market-research/market-review-archive/platinum-2009 Summary. Ruthenium]. platinum.matthey.com, p. 9 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; to some 35.5 tonnes in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.platinum.matthey.com/services/market-research/pgm-market-reports PGM Market Report.] platinum.matthey.com, p. 30 (May 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum [[alloy]]s and as a chemistry [[Catalysis|catalyst]]. A new application of ruthenium is as the capping layer for extreme ultraviolet photomasks. Ruthenium is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the [[Ural Mountains]] and in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]. Small but commercially important quantities are also found in [[pentlandite]] extracted from [[Sudbury, Ontario]] and in [[pyroxenite]] deposits in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Platinum-Geological_Survey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/platinum/platimcs07.pdf |format=PDF |title=Platinum&amp;ndash;Group Metals |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries |date=January 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
[[File:Ruthenium crystals.jpg|thumb|left|Gas phase grown crystals of ruthenium metal.]]

A [[Valence (chemistry)#Common valences|polyvalent]] hard white metal. Ruthenium is a member of the [[platinum group]] and is in [[group 8 element|group 8]] of the periodic table:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
![[Atomic number|Z]] !! [[Chemical element|Element]] !! [[Electron shell|No. of electrons/shell]]
|-
| 26 || [[iron]] || 2, 8, 14, 2
|-
| 44 || ruthenium || 2, 8, 18, 15, 1
|-
| 76 || [[osmium]] || 2, 8, 18, 32, 14, 2
|-
| 108 || [[hassium]] || 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 14, 2
|}

Whereas all other group 8 elements have 2 electrons in the outermost shell, in ruthenium, the outermost shell has only one electron (the final electron is in a lower shell). This anomaly is observed in the neighboring metals [[niobium]] (41), [[molybdenum]] (42), and [[rhodium]] (45).

Ruthenium has four crystal modifications and does not tarnish unless subject to high temperatures. Ruthenium dissolves in fused alkalis to give ruthenates ({{chem|RuO|4|2-}}), is not attacked by acids (even [[aqua regia]]) but is attacked by [[halogen]]s at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; Indeed, ruthenium is most readily attacked by oxidizing agents.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1076&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1076&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of ruthenium can increase the hardness of [[platinum]] and [[palladium]]. The [[corrosion]] resistance of [[titanium]] is increased markedly by the addition of a small amount of ruthenium.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Hamond, C.R. "The elements", in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal can be plated by [[electroplating]] and by thermal decomposition. A ruthenium-[[molybdenum]] alloy is known to be [[superconductivity|superconductive]] at temperatures below 10.6 [[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; Ruthenium is the last of the 4d transition metals that can assume the group oxidation state +8, and even then it is less stable there than the heavier congener osmium: this is the first group from the left of the table where the second and third-row transition metals display notable differences in chemical behavior. Like iron but unlike osmium, ruthenium can form aqueous cations in its lower oxidation states of +2 and +3.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1078&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1078&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruthenium is the first in a downward trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at [[molybdenum]], because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. ([[Technetium]], the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled [Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a [Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as [[manganese]] in the 3d transition series.)&lt;ref name=Greenwood1075&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1075&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is [[paramagnetic]] at room temperature, as iron also is above its [[Curie point]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1074/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of ruthenium}}
Naturally occurring ruthenium is composed of seven stable [[isotope]]s. Additionally, 34 [[radioactive isotopes]] have been discovered. Of these [[radioisotope]]s, the most stable are &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Ru with a [[half-life]] of 373.59 days, &lt;sup&gt;103&lt;/sup&gt;Ru with a half-life of 39.26 days and &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Ru with a half-life of 2.9 days.&lt;ref name=n1/&gt;&lt;ref name=n2/&gt;

Fifteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with [[atomic weight]]s ranging from 89.93 [[unified atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Ru) to 114.928 u (&lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;Ru). Most of these have half-lives that are less than five minutes except &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Ru (half-life: 1.643 hours) and &lt;sup&gt;105&lt;/sup&gt;Ru (half-life: 4.44 hours).&lt;ref name=n1/&gt;&lt;ref name=n2/&gt;

The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant isotope, &lt;sup&gt;102&lt;/sup&gt;Ru, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta emission]]. The primary [[decay product]] before &lt;sup&gt;102&lt;/sup&gt;Ru is [[technetium]] and the primary decay product after is [[rhodium]].&lt;ref name=n1&gt;{{RubberBible86th}} Section 11, Table of the Isotopes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=n2&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://amdc.in2p3.fr/web/nubase_en.html |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|title=The Nubase evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|issue=1|date=2003|page=3|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last1=Audi|first1=G.|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A.

Small but commercially important quantities are also found in [[pentlandite]] extracted from [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], and in [[pyroxenite]] deposits in [[South Africa]].

==Production==
Roughly 12 tonnes of ruthenium are mined each year with world reserves estimated at 5,000 tonnes.&lt;ref name="Emsley"/&gt; The composition of the mined [[platinum group metal]] (PGM) mixtures varies widely, depending on the geochemical formation. For example, the PGMs mined in South Africa contain on average 11% ruthenium while the PGMs mined in the former USSR contain only 2% (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wm6QMRaX9C4C&amp;pg=PA69|page =69|isbn = 978-0-87335-100-3|editor = Hartman, H.

Ruthenium, like the other platinum group metals, is obtained commercially as a by-product from [[nickel]], and [[copper]], and platinum metals ore processing. During [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|electrorefining of copper]] and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold, and the platinum group metals precipitate as ''anode mud'', the [[feedstock]] for the extraction.&lt;ref name="USGS-YB-2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS-CS-2008" /&gt; The metals are converted to ionized solutes by any of several methods, depending on the composition of the feedstock.  One representative method is fusion with [[sodium peroxide]] followed by dissolution in [[aqua regia]], and solution in a mixture of [[chlorine]] with [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name="ullmann-pt"&gt;{{cite book |author=Renner, H.|author2=Schlamp, G.|author3=Kleinwächter, I.|author4=Drost, E.|author5=Lüschow, H.

==Chemical compounds==
{{See also|Category:Ruthenium compounds}}
The [[oxidation state]]s of ruthenium range from 0 to +8, and −2. The properties of ruthenium and osmium [[Chemical compound|compounds]] are often similar. The +2, +3, and +4 states are the most common. The most prevalent precursor is [[ruthenium trichloride]], a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile synthetically.&lt;ref name=cotton/&gt;

===Oxides and chalcogenides===
Ruthenium can be [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[ruthenium(IV) oxide]] (RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, oxidation state +4) which can in turn be oxidized by sodium metaperiodate to the volatile yellow tetrahedral [[ruthenium tetroxide]], RuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, an aggressive, strong oxidizing agent with structure and properties analogous to [[osmium tetroxide]]. Like osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide is a potent fixative and stain for electron microscopy of organic materials, and is mostly used to reveal the structure of polymer samples.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0032-3861(96)00962-7|title=New method for the characterization of domain morphology of polymer blends using ruthenium tetroxide staining and low voltage scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM)|journal=Polymer|volume=38|issue=15|pages=3937|year=1997|last1=Brown|first1=G.M.|last2=Butler|first2=J.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dipotassium ruthenate (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, +6), and potassium perruthenate (KRuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, +7) are also known.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). ''Chemistry of the Elements'' (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide is less stable and is strong enough as an oxidising agent to oxidise dilute [[hydrochloric acid]] and organic solvents like [[ethanol]] at room temperature, and is easily reduced to ruthenate ({{chem|RuO|4|2-}}) in aqueous alkaline solutions; it decomposes to form the dioxide above 100&amp;nbsp;°C. Unlike iron but like osmium, ruthenium does not form oxides in its lower +2 and +3 oxidation states.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1080&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1080–1&lt;/ref&gt; Ruthenium forms dichalcogenides only when reacted directly with the [[chalcogen]]s, which are diamagnetic semiconductors crystallizing in the [[pyrite]] structure and thus must contain ruthenium(II).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1080/&gt;

Like iron, ruthenium does not readily form oxoanions, and prefers to achieve high coordination numbers with hydroxide ions instead. Ruthenium tetroxide is reduced by cold dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] to form black potassium perruthenate, KRuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, with ruthenium in the +7 oxidation state.  Potassium perruthenate can also be produced by oxidising potassium ruthenate, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, with chlorine gas. The perruthenate ion is unstable and is reduced by water to form the orange ruthenate. Potassium ruthenate may be synthesized by reacting ruthenium metal with potassium hydroxide and [[potassium nitrate]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1082&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1082&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mixed oxides are also known, such as M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Ru&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Na{{su|b=2}}Ru{{su|p=V|b=2}}O{{su|b=7}}, and M{{su|p=II|b=2}}Ln{{su|p=III}}Ru{{su|p=V}}O{{su|b=6}}.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1082" /&gt;

===Halides and oxyhalides===
The highest known ruthenium halide is the [[ruthenium hexafluoride|hexafluoride]], a dark brown solid that melts at 54&amp;nbsp;°C. It hydrolyzes violently upon contact with water and easily disproportionates to form a mixture of lower ruthenium fluorides, releasing fluorine gas. [[Ruthenium pentafluoride]] is a tetrameric dark green solid that is also readily hydrolyzed, melting at 86.5&amp;nbsp;°C. The yellow [[ruthenium tetrafluoride]] is probably also polymeric and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with [[iodine]]. Among the binary compounds of ruthenium, these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and fluorides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1083&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1083&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruthenium trichloride]] is a well-known compound, existing in a black α-form and a dark brown β-form: the trihydrate is red.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1084&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1084&lt;/ref&gt; Of the known trihalides, trifluoride is dark brown and decomposes above 650&amp;nbsp;°C, tetrabromide is dark-brown and decomposes above 400&amp;nbsp;°C, and triiodide is black.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1083/&gt; Of the dihalides, difluoride is not known, dichloride is brown, dibromide is black, and diiodide is blue.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1083/&gt; The only known oxyhalide is the pale green ruthenium(VI) oxyfluoride, RuOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1084/&gt;

===Coordination and organometallic complexes===

[[File:Grubbs catalyst Gen2.svg|alt=Skeletal formula of Grubbs' catalyst.|thumb|220x220px|Grubbs' catalyst, which earned a Nobel Prize for its inventor, is used in [[alkene metathesis]] reactions.]]
Ruthenium forms a variety of coordination complexes. Examples are the many pentammine derivatives [Ru(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;L]&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; that often exist for both Ru(II) and Ru(III). Derivatives of [[bipyridine]] and [[terpyridine]] are numerous, best known being the [[luminescence|luminescent]] [[tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride]].

Ruthenium forms a wide range compounds with carbon-ruthenium bonds. [[Grubbs' catalyst]] is used for alkene metathesis.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. ''Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis'', University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|1-891389-53-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruthenocene]] is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid [[ruthenium pentacarbonyl]] converts in the absence of CO pressure to the dark red solid [[triruthenium dodecacarbonyl]]. [[Ruthenium(III) chloride|Ruthenium trichloride]] reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Ru(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Roper's complex]]). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with [[triphenylphosphine]] gives [[tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride]] (RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=cotton/&gt;

==History==
Though naturally occurring platinum alloys containing all six [[platinum-group metal]]s were used for a long time by [[pre-Columbian]] Americans and known as a material to European chemists from the mid-16th century, not until the mid-18th century was platinum identified as a pure element. That natural platinum contained palladium, rhodium, osmium and iridium was discovered in the first decade of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Weeks8"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1017|title = The discovery of the elements.

It is possible that the [[Poland|Polish]] chemist [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]] isolated element 44 (which he called "vestium" after the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] discovered shortly before) from South American platinum ores in 1807. He published an announcement of his discovery in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jędrzej Śniadecki | title = Rosprawa o nowym metallu w surowey platynie odkrytym | language = Polish | year = 1808 | publisher = Nakł. i Drukiem J.

[[Jöns Berzelius]] and [[Gottfried Osann]] nearly discovered ruthenium in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=x57C3yhRPUAC&amp;pg=PA391|pages = 391–392|title = New Metals in the Uralian Platina|volume = 2|issue = 11|date = 1827| journal = The Philosophical Magazine|doi=10.1080/14786442708674516}}&lt;/ref&gt; They examined residues that were left after dissolving crude platinum from the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[aqua regia]]. Berzelius did not find any unusual metals, but Osann thought he found three new metals, which he called pluranium, ruthenium, and polinium. This discrepancy led to a long-standing controversy between Berzelius and Osann about the composition of the residues.&lt;ref name="DiscoRu"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Discovery of Ruthenium| first = V.

In 1844, [[Karl Ernst Claus]], a Russian scientist of [[Baltic German]] descent, showed that the compounds prepared by Gottfried Osann contained small amounts of ruthenium, which Claus had [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] the same year.&lt;ref name="Weeks8"/&gt; Claus isolated ruthenium from the platinum residues of rouble production while he was working in [[Kazan University]], [[Kazan]],&lt;ref name="DiscoRu"/&gt; the same way its heavier congener osmium had been discovered four decades earlier.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1071/&gt; Claus showed that ruthenium oxide contained a new metal and obtained 6&amp;nbsp;grams of ruthenium from the part of crude platinum that is insoluble in [[aqua regia]].&lt;ref name="DiscoRu"/&gt; Choosing the name for the new element, Claus stated: "I named the new body, in honour of my Motherland, ruthenium.

===Catalysis===
Many ruthenium-containing compounds exhibit useful catalytic properties.  The catalysts are conveniently divided into those that are soluble in the reaction medium, [[homogeneous catalyst]]s, and those that are not, which are called [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s.

====Homogeneous catalysis====

Such catalysts are used commercially for the production of polynorbornene for example.&lt;ref name=KO&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|authors=Lionel Delaude, Alfred F.

Ruthenium complexes are highly active catalyst for [[transfer hydrogenation]]s (sometimes referred to as "borrowing hydrogen" reactions).  This process is employed for the [[asymmetric hydrogenation|enantioselective hydrogenation]] of [[ketone]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[imine]]s. This reaction exploits using [[chiral]] ruthenium complexes introduced by [[Ryoji Noyori]].&lt;ref name="citation 21"&gt;{{citation |author1=Noyori, R. |author2=Ohkuma, T. |author3=Kitamura, M. |author4=Takaya, H. |author5=Sayo, N. |author6=Kumobayashi, H. |author7=Akutagawa, S. |journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]|title=Asymmetric hydrogenation of .beta.-keto carboxylic esters.

A [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was awarded in 2001 to [[Ryōji Noyori]] for contributions to the field of [[asymmetric hydrogenation]].

In 2012, Masaaki Kitano (and 9 co-authors), working with an organic ruthenium catalyst, demonstrated "Ammonia Synthesis Using a Stable Electride as an Electron Donor and Reversible Hydrogen Store"&lt;ref&gt;{doi = 10.1038/nchem.1476}&lt;/ref&gt;.

By depositing a layer of ruthenium on the TaN barrier layer, copper adhesion would be improved and deposition of a copper seed layer would not be necessary.

There are also other suggested uses. In 1990, [[IBM]] scientists discovered that a thin layer of ruthenium atoms created a strong anti-parallel coupling between adjacent [[ferromagnetic]] layers, stronger than any other nonmagnetic spacer-layer element. Such a ruthenium layer was used in the first [[Giant magnetoresistance|giant magnetoresistive]] read element for [[hard disk drive]]s. In 2001, IBM announced a three-atom-thick layer of the element ruthenium, informally referred to as "pixie dust", which would allow a quadrupling of the data density of current hard disk drive media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hayes, Brian |title=Terabyte Territory|journal=American Scientist|volume= 90|issue=3|year=2002|page=212|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/terabyte-territory|doi=10.1511/2002.9.3287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In July 2013, the government of Rwanda contracted with GigaWatt Global, a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] firm, to develop an 8.5 Megawatt solar power plant in Rwamagana District, Eastern Province, for a contract price of US$23 million (RwF:15 billion). GigaWatt Global would finance, build, own and operate the facility for 25 years, with the power produced sold to Rwanda Energy, the national electricity utility.&lt;ref name="Sign"/&gt;

In February 2014, GigaWatt Global was able to reach financial closure, allowing construction to begin. Interconnection to the national electricity grid was achieved in July 2014, and by September 2014, the power plant was producing at maximum capacity. The power station consists of 28,360 individual photovoltaic panels spread out on a {{convert|50|acre|ha}} field. The final construction price, including the cost to access the national grid came to US$23.7 million. Funding came from multiple sources, including (a) [[Netherlands Development Finance Company]] (b) Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund and (c) [[Norfund]]. The United States [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] and Finland's Energy and Environment Partnership provided grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwa.one/2015/07/19/in-rwanda-israelis-and-americans-launch-east-africas-first-commercial-solar-field/|title=In Rwanda, Israelis And Americans Launch East Africa's First Commercial Solar Field|last=Administrator|first=.|publisher=Rwa.one|date=19 July 2015|accessdate=24 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724205059/http://www.rwa.one/2015/07/19/in-rwanda-israelis-and-americans-launch-east-africas-first-commercial-solar-field/|archivedate=24 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shellite''' (known as '''Tridite''' in US service&lt;ref&gt;Meyer ''et al'', p.417&lt;/ref&gt;) is an explosive mixture of [[picric acid]] and [[dinitrophenol]] or picric acid and [[hexanitrodiphenylamine]] in a ratio of 70/30. It was typically used as a filling in [[Royal Navy]] armour-piercing shells during the early part of the 20th century.

== History ==
Shellite originated after [[World War I]] as a development of lyddite (picric acid). During the war, lyddite-filled, [[armour-piercing]] [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] had been found to be shock-sensitive, with a tendency to prematurely detonate upon impact rather than after penetrating the target's armour plate.&lt;ref&gt;Preston et al, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Shellite was less sensitive, and also had the advantage of a low [[melting point]], that allowed it to be easily melted and poured into shell casings during manufacture.&lt;ref name="Zukas"&gt;Zukas et al, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The first trials of shellite took place in 1921, when the British [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] {{HMS|Terror|I03|6}} experimentally fired different types of [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15 inch shell]] at {{convert|500|yd|m|adj=on}}, point-blank range against the surrendered German ship [[SMS Baden]].&lt;ref name="Zukas" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], Shellite continued to be used in naval shells. It was used in the British [[Disney bomb]], a type of concrete-piercing bomb.

==Legacy==
Shellite-filled munitions may still be encountered in the [[shipwreck|wrecks]] of sunken [[warships]]. They are considered hazardous as, over time, picric acid will react to form [[crystal]]s of metal [[picrate]]s, such as [[iron picrate]]. These crystals are extremely shock sensitive and it is recommended that wrecks that contain shellite [[munition]]s not be disturbed in any way.&lt;ref name="allbright78"&gt;Albright, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; The hazard may reduce when the shells become corroded enough to admit [[seawater]] as these materials are [[water-soluble]].&lt;ref name="allbright78" /&gt;

'''Standard wind tunnel models''', also known as reference models, calibration models ({{lang-fr|maquettes d'étalonnage}}) or test check-standards are objects of relatively simple and precisely defined shapes, having known  aerodynamic characteristics, that are tested in [[wind tunnel]]s. Standard models are used in order to verify, by comparison of wind tunnel test results with previously published results, the complete measurement chain in a wind tunnel, including wind tunnel structure, quality of the airstream, model positioning, [[transducer]]s and force balances, [[data acquisition]] system and [[data reduction]] software.&lt;ref name="ReedPope"&gt;Reed T.D., Pope T.C., Coksey T.M., [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19780007115.pdf "Calibration of Transonic and Supersonic Wind Tunnels"], NASA CR 2920, NASA, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AG54"&gt;Pope A., [http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public/PubFullText/AGARD/AG/AGARD-AG-54/AGARD-AG-54.pdf "Wind Tunnel Calibration Techniques"], AGARDograph 54, AGARD, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, standard wind tunnel models are used for:

*confirmation of the reliability of the data from a new wind tunnel by comparison with results from other wind tunnel facilities;
*providing baselines for correlation of results from different wind tunnels;
*checkouts of data [[repeatability]] over time;
*checkouts of data repeatability after repairs or modifications of the wind tunnel structure;
*assessment of the wall interference effects;
*identification of problems and faults in the operation of a wind tunnel;
*verification of new measurement techniques or devices;
*training of wind tunnel personnel.

Besides, results from wind tunnel tests of standard models are used as test cases for verification of computational-fluid-dynamics  ([[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]]) computer codes.

In most wind tunnels, standard models are tested during the commissioning and [[calibration]]&lt;ref name="ReedPope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AG54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="recpracal"&gt;"Recommended Practice: Calibration of Subsonic and Transonic Wind Tunnels", AIAA-R093-2003, AIAA, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; of the facility. 
This sometimes has an unfortunate effect that the test results are not as good as they can be,
because the wind tunnel and its measurement system have not yet been optimally tuned at the time of the test.&lt;ref name="Hills"&gt;Hills R., [http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFullText/AGARD/AG/AGARD-AG-64/AGARD-AG-64.pdf "A review of measurements on AGARD Calibration Models"], 
AGARDograph 64, Aircraft Research Association Bedford, England, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, some laboratories
have adopted the practice of periodical testing of a standard model
every couple of years in order to provide a continued confidence in the 
reliability of measurements in their wind tunnels 
.&lt;ref name="Hemsch"&gt;Hemsch M., Grubb J., Krieger W., Cler D.,

Standard wind tunnel models are usually (but not always) intended for one of the basic wind tunnel
measurement types, such as the [[Wind tunnel#measurement of aerodynamic forces|measurement of forces and moments]] with force balances or measurements of [[pressure distribution]]. Results of wind tunnel tests of these models  are generally published in the form of nondimensional [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)#aerodynamic coefficients|aerodynamic coefficients]] (thus being made independent of model size) and made
available to the wind-tunnel community, often in review reports containing inter-facility comparisons of data,&lt;ref name="Hills"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agard38"&gt;Damljanoviċ D., Vitiċ A, Vukovic Ð., Isakoviċ J.,

As the majority of wind tunnel tests is related to [[aeronautics]], most
standard wind tunnel models resemble simplified forms of [[wing]]s, [[airplane]]s or [[missile]]s.  
Such are, for static tests:  [[NACA 0012 airfoil|'''NACA 0012''']] and [[Clark Y|'''CLARK Y''']]
(2D wing-segment models with typical [[airfoil]]s), [[AGARD-B wind tunnel model|'''AGARD-B / AGARD-C''']] 
(generic [[delta-wing]]-airplane shapes), 
'''[[ONERA]]-M''' (a generic transport-airplane shape), '''[[HB-2]]''' (Hypervelocity ballistic model 2, a shape similar to a [[atmospheric entry|reentry-body]]). For dynamic tests, the often-used standard models are: '''SDM''' (Standard dynamic model, a generic fighter-like airplane shape somewhat similar to [[F-16]])), 
'''BFM''' (Basic finner model, a generic conical-cylindrical missile with four fins at the rear end) and '''MBFM''' (Modified basic finner model&lt;ref name="majapartg"&gt;Samardžić M., Anastasijević Z., Marinkovski D., Isaković J., Tančić Lj., [http://pig.sagepub.com/content/226/11/1401 "Measurement of pitch- and roll-damping derivatives using the semiconductor five-component strain gauge balance"], [http://pig.sagepub.com Proc ImechE Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering], Vol.228 no. 11, November 2012, pp.1401-1411&lt;/ref&gt;). A number of other standard models exists as well.

With the increased use of wind tunnels in the testing of road vehicles, several standard
models of generic car shapes were defined.,&lt;ref name="refcars"&gt;LeGood G, Gerry, K. [http://papers.sae.org/2004-01-1308 "On the Use of Reference Models in Automotive Aerodynamics,"][http://papers.sae.org SAE Technical Paper] 2004-01-1308, 2004, doi:10.4271/2004-01-1308&lt;/ref&gt; such as the

Some wind tunnel laboratories perform periodical checkouts using internally defined standard models
that are selected from the repository of models previously tested in the facility&lt;ref name="UPWT"&gt;

Geometry of a standard wind tunnel model is defined relative to some easily identified
parameter ([[:Image:AGARD-B standard model geometry.png|see figure]]), e.g. body diameter or [[Chord (aeronautics)|wing chord]].&lt;ref name="Agardspec"/&gt; The geometry is published by the institution proposing the model. Beside the model itself, a standard model support, such as a [[sting (fixture)|sting]], to be used with the model, is usually defined. An actual model is built to a size suitable for the size of a specific wind tunnel test section, in particular taking care that the frontal blockage of the model (the ratio of the model cross-section area to wind tunnel test section area) is kept well below 1% (except for wall-interference research where the models may be larger).

In order to eliminate the effects of production differences between models in inter-facility comparisons, sometimes the same physical standard model is tested in several wind tunnels &lt;ref name="Agard38"/&gt;

'''''Switch''''' is a documentary film on global energy directed by Harry Lynch, produced and distributed by [[Arcos Films]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcosfilms.com/Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and featuring  [[Scott W. Tinker]], a geologist and energy researcher who runs the Bureau of Economic Geology, a 200-person research unit of The [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beg.utexas.edu/Tinker/tinker_about.php University of Texas, Bureau of Economic Geology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113190743/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/Tinker/tinker_about.php |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a professor at the [[Jackson School of Geosciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/ Jackson School of Geosciences]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is part of a larger energy education and efficiency project, which also includes the Switch Energy Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.switchenergyproject.com/ Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; website, with additional video content&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.switchenergyproject.com/topics/alltopics Switch Energy Project]&lt;/ref&gt; and educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.switchenergyproject.com/education.php#energyeducationprogram Switch Energy Project]&lt;/ref&gt; The website includes interviews with some of the world's leading energy policy analysts. Interviews including [[Ernest Moniz|Ernie Moniz]], former Under Secretary of Energy, [[Steven E. Koonin]], Deputy Executive Director of the [[International Energy Agency]], [[Richard Jones (U.S. diplomat)|Richard Jones]] and physicist [[Richard A. Muller]]. 

The film aims to be a [[nonpartisan]], scientifically based exploration of the [[energy transition]] from the traditional energies of coal and oil to future energies. It has been accepted by many environmental groups, government agencies, fossil and [[renewable energy]] companies and academic institutions. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.switchenergyproject.com/screenings.php Switch Energy Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Switch'' premiered at the 2012 Environmental Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcenvironmentalfilmfest.org/films/show/742 DC Environmental Film Fest]&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington DC to positive reviews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcfilmreview.com/DC_Film_Review/Reviews/Entries/2012/9/11_Switch__Its_All_in_the_Numbers.html DC Film Review]&lt;/ref&gt; then played at 12 other international festivals, most of them environmentally focused, and at 6 international geology conferences, before opening in theaters in New York in September 2012.

==Synopsis==
''Switch'' begins in Norway, where Dr. Tinker explores an electricity system built on renewable [[hydropower]]. There, he asks the central question of the film: what will the energy transition look like for the rest of us. Over the next 90 minutes, he travels the world to find out. His first step is to calculate how much energy the average person uses in a year, including all the energy embodied in the food and products we consume, the roads and public buildings we share. He uses that figure to measure and compare each energy type he visits.

Tinker starts with the big conventional energies, coal and oil, trying to determine their futures. Can coal be clean? Will we keep using it? Will oil price keep rising? Will we run out of it? He then examines the energies that may replace them. For oil, those are biofuels, natural gas and electricity. For coal, they are geothermal, solar, wind, natural gas and nuclear. 

With each type, he visits some of the world’s leading facilities, talks to top experts in the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], universities and within each industry, and gives a concise and objective analysis of each resource’s major pros and cons. The expertise of the interviewees and the access to restricted energy sites is unparalleled in other energy films.

After his journey, he assembles his findings to map out the likely energy future. While coal and oil will continue to play a large role especially in developing countries, a global transition to where their alternatives become dominant will happen in about 50 years. Renewables see by far the largest growth rate, while natural gas makes up the largest portion of the replacement, with nuclear approximately equal in share to renewables.

Tinker ends by emphasizing that [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], including personal [[energy conservation]], will play a vital and growing role in a successful energy future: “The most important thing is to change the way we think about energy, so we can change the way we use it.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.switchenergyproject.com/topics/efficiency Switch Energy Project Efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
"''Switch'' is refreshingly free of hot air. It’s almost shocking in the way it sidesteps the kind of issue advocacy made commonplace by filmmakers [[Michael Moore]], [[Davis Guggenheim]] and the like. Lynch’s film tries (and largely succeeds) in taking a scrupulously neutral tack between extremes." - ''The Washington Post''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/switch,1225679/critic-review.html#reviewNum1 Review in ''The Washington Post'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Sidestepping the usual eco-docu strategy, ''Switch'' takes a far less hysterical route. Lynch’s method gives a rational evaluation of where the world is heading. It’s considerably more honest, and manages to be quite effective. Tech credits are tops, particularly the seamless editing and the often beautiful photography.” - ''Variety''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948696/ Review in ''Variety'']&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tinker comes across as affable, reasonable, and unfailingly curious. His interview 
subjects are technicians, business executives, scientists, government officials. It insures a tone of dispassionate seriousness and good will." - ''Boston Globe''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2012/09/11/switch-drill-maybe-drill/ALdFPmpnxYAls2ZVxALadP/story.html Review in ''Boston Globe'']&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tinker takes us along for this beautifully shot ride, excellent in its details, and mixes a kind of gee-whiz wonderment at the way energy is produced with pithy, on-the-mark observations about the realities of those sources. He foresees the increasing use of renewables, natural gas and nuclear power in the US. But he also offers a sobering forecast of why we’re unlikely to shake coal and oil for a long time." - ''Austin American-Statesman''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/movies/films-with-austin-ties-aim-to-take-open-minded-loo/nSm6R/ Review in Austin American Statesman]&lt;/ref&gt;

"There's no one solution to solving the energy crisis, but that's where Switch provides a valuable resource. In addition to the film, the Switch Energy Project also provides a deep video archive of the many interviews Dr. Tinker captured and used throughout the film." - ''[[TreeHugger]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/energy-policy/Switch-Energy-Project-Expert-Interviews.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
As of 2013, ''Switch'' is currently screening at university campuses as part of an energy awareness and efficiency program sponsored by the [[Geological Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/switch/ The GSA Switch Energy Awareness &amp; Efficiency Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.switchenergyproject.com/education.php#universityenergyprogram Switch Energy Project University Energy Awareness &amp; Efficiency Program]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The website mentions an upcoming primary education program being co-developed with the [[American Geosciences Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.switchenergyproject.com/education.php#energyeducationprogram Switch Energy Project Energy Education Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heissluft-luftschiff 2011-1.jpg|thumb|300px|Hot air airship made by Gefa-Flug]]

A '''thermal airship''' is an [[airship]] that generates [[buoyancy]] by heating air in a large chamber or [[airship#Envelope|envelope]].  The lower density of interior hot air compared to cool ambient air causes an upward force on the envelope.  This is very similar to a [[hot air balloon]], with the notable exception that an airship has a powered means of propulsion, whilst a hot air balloon relies on winds for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/07/airships|title=The Difference Engine: Not all hot air|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An airship that uses [[steam]] would also qualify as a thermal airship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyingkettle.com/jbfa.htm Steam Balloon JBFA Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of airships use a gas that is [[lighter than air]] at ambient temperature, such as [[helium]], as a [[lifting gas]].

Some airship designs that use a lighter-than-air lifting gas heat a portion of the gas, which is usually  maintained in enclosed cells to gain additional lift. Heating the lifting gas causes expansion of the gas in order to further lower the density of the lifting gas, which results in greater lift.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Thermal airships have the advantage of being much less expensive than [[helium]]-based airships.  They are also routinely deflated after each flight and can be readily packed for storage and/or transport, making them [[blimp| blimps]] rather than rigid airships.

Hot air craft produce much less uplift per unit volume than [[helium]]- or [[hydrogen]]-filled craft (about 30% depending on air conditions).  This necessitates lighter construction, with fewer controls and hence more difficulty in maneuvering. This leads to:
*lower [[airspeed]]s
*difficulty in handling on the ground if the ground wind is above 5 knots
*difficulty in steering, particularly at low air speeds
*lack of elevator (pitch) control, causing the airship to pitch up or down in response to changes in the throttle setting (a motion called 'porpoising')

In recent years, the steering of these ships has improved somewhat.  The most successful approach has been to use higher pressure in the tail fin structures than in the rest of the envelope, or to use an internal structure (see below).

==History==
[[File:Skyacht personal blimp first flight.jpg|thumb|Skyacht Personal Blimp - another type of thermal airship]]

The first public flight of a hot air airship was made by Don Cameron (UK) in a [[Cameron D-96]] at the Icicle Meet in January 1973. The aircraft reportedly took 3 years to develop.

==Envelope structures==
Most thermal airships are non-rigid.  Some are pressurized.  In some cases, the pressurized air is taken from a duct located behind the propeller.  In other cases, the pressurized air comes from a separate fan.

In 2006, a new type of envelope employing a [[tensile membrane structure]] was developed by [[Skyacht Aircraft]].  This design uses an unpressurized envelope and an internal structure that uses ribs made of [[aluminium]] to keep the envelope in shape.  When not in use, the structure folds up in a manner similar to an umbrella.  The structure also permits the mounting of a steerable engine/propeller on the tail of the aircraft.  The tail-mounted propeller provides for [[vectored thrust]] steering, allowing tight turns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRMaX0s_cRg Youtube video of Skyacht]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

Like hot air balloons, thermal airships are first inflated partially with cold (ambient temperature) air.  Once the envelopes are sufficiently full, a [[propane]] burner is ignited and the inflation is completed using heated air.

Schubert |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|volume=56|pages=2891–2907|accessdate=2009-12-23|year=1999|issn=0022-4928|issue=16|bibcode = 1999JAtS...56.2891N }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] situated in upper-level (at about 200 hPa) [[tropics]]. Its formation is usually caused by the intrusion of energy and wind from the mid-latitudes into the tropics. It can also develop from the inverted trough adjacent to an upper level anticyclone. TUTTs are different from mid-latitude troughs in the sense that they are maintained by subsidence warming near the [[tropopause]] which balances radiational cooling.  When strong, they can present a significant vertical [[wind shear]] to the tropics and subdue [[tropical cyclogenesis]].  When [[Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex|upper cold lows]] break off from their base, they tend to retrograde and force the development, or enhance, surface troughs and tropical waves to their east.  Under special circumstances, they can induce thunderstorm activity and lead to the formation of [[tropical cyclone]]s.

==Location==
The TUTT is elongated from east-northeast to west-southwest across oceans of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and west-northwest to east-southeast across oceans of the [[Southern Hemisphere]].  In the South Pacific, it stretches from near the equator at the [[175th meridian west]] to the east-southeast near 30N 105W, offshore the western [[South America]]n coast.  In the South Atlantic, the TUTT extends from near the equator at the [[75th meridian west]] east-southeast to 30N 15W, offshore the western coast of southern [[Africa]].  In the North Atlantic, the TUTT is oriented from 35N 30W (south of the [[Azores]]) to 22N 95W (the southern [[Gulf of Mexico]]).  In the North Pacific, it stretches from 35N 145W (offshore western [[North America]]) to 22N 135E, offshore the northeast coast of the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="KingTUTT"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uZvIuDv6A4gC&amp;pg=PA515&amp;dq=typhoon+origins+northwest+Pacific#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=519|title=Synoptic and dynamic climatology|author1=Roger Graham Barry  |author2=Andrew Mark Carleton |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-03115-8|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects within the tropics==
TUTTs sometimes brings a large amount of vertical wind shear over tropical disturbances in the deep tropics and cyclones and thus hinder their development.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn White. [http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/noor/tutt.htm Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough—July 2001.] Retrieved on 2008-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are cases that TUTTs assist the [[tropical cyclogenesis|genesis and intensification of tropical cyclones]] by providing additional forced ascent near the storm center and an efficient outflow channel in the upper [[troposphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=James C. Sadler|title=A Role of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough in Early Season Typhoon Development|journal=Monthly Weather Review|pages=1266–1278|volume=104|issue=10|date=October 1976|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1976)104&lt;1266:AROTTU&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1976MWRv..104.1266S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is most likely near its most westward and equatorward periphery.&lt;ref name="KingTUTT"/&gt;

==Upper lows pinching off from their base==
{{Main|Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex}}
Under specific circumstances, upper cold lows can break off from the base of the TUTT.  These upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices usually move slowly from east-northeast to west-southwest, and generally do not extend below 20,000 feet in altitude. A weak inverted wave in the easterlies is generally found underneath them, and they may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds. Downward development results in an increase of [[cumulus clouds]] and the appearance of a surface vortex. In rare cases, they become warm-core, resulting in the vortex becoming a [[tropical cyclone]].  Upper cyclones and upper troughs which trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification process.   Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone.&lt;ref name="CLARK"&gt;{{cite web | author = Clark Evans |url = http://flhurricane.com/cyclone/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Number=64429&amp;an=0&amp;page=0 | title = Favorable trough interactions on tropical cyclones | publisher = Flhurricane.com | date = January 5, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMSPAPER"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deborah Hanley |author2=John Molinari |author3=Daniel Keyser  |last-author-amp=yes | title = A Composite Study of the Interactions between Tropical Cyclones and Upper-Tropospheric Troughs |date=October 2001 | journal = [[Monthly Weather Review]] | volume = 129 | issue = 10 | pages = 2570–84 | doi = 10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129&lt;2570:ACSOTI&gt;2.0.CO;2 | bibcode=2001MWRv..129.2570H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid dynamics]], '''turbulence kinetic energy''' ('''TKE''') is the mean [[kinetic energy]] per unit mass associated with [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] in [[turbulent flow]]. Physically, the turbulence kinetic energy is characterised by measured [[root-mean-square]] (RMS) velocity fluctuations.

In [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes equations]], the turbulence kinetic energy can be calculated based on the closure method, i.e. a [[Turbulence modeling|turbulence model]]. Generally, the TKE can be quantified by the mean of the turbulence normal stresses:

:&lt;math&gt; k = \frac12 \left(\, \overline{(u')^2} + \overline{(v')^2} + \overline{(w')^2} \,\right). &lt;/math&gt;

TKE can be produced by fluid shear, friction or buoyancy, or through external forcing at low-frequency eddy scales(integral scale). Turbulence kinetic energy is then transferred down the turbulence [[energy cascade]], and is dissipated by viscous forces at the [[Kolmogorov microscales|Kolmogorov scale]]. This process of production, transport and dissipation can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{Dk}{Dt} + \nabla \cdot T' = P - \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;

where:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pope|first=S. B.|date=2000|title=Turbulent Flows|location=Cambridge|pages=122–134|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}{{missing ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{mvar|{{sfrac|Dk|Dt}}}} is the mean-flow [[material derivative]] of TKE;
* {{math|∇ · ''T′''}} is the turbulence transport of TKE;
* {{mvar|P}} is the production of TKE, and
* {{mvar|ε}} is the TKE dissipation.

Assuming density and viscosity both constant, the full form of the TKE equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\underbrace{ \frac{\partial k}{\partial t}}_{ \begin{smallmatrix}\text{Local}\\\text{derivative}\end{smallmatrix}}
+
\underbrace{\overline{u}_j \frac{\partial k}{\partial x_j}}_{ \begin{smallmatrix}\text{Advection}\end{smallmatrix}}
= - 
\underbrace{ \frac{1}{\rho_o} \frac{\partial \overline{u'_i p'}}{\partial x_i} 	} _{ \begin{smallmatrix}\text{Pressure}\\\text{diffusion}\end{smallmatrix}}
-  
\underbrace{ \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial \overline{u_j' u_j' u_i'}}{\partial x_i} 	}_{ \begin{smallmatrix}										\text{Turbulent}\\											\text{transport} \\											\mathcal{T}											\end{smallmatrix}}
	+ \underbrace{ \nu\frac{\partial^2 k}{\partial x^2_j} 						}_{\begin{smallmatrix}										\text{Molecular}\\										\text{viscous}\\										\text{transport}											\end{smallmatrix}}
	\underbrace{ - \overline{u'_i u'_j}\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} 		}_{\begin{smallmatrix}										\text{Production}\\											\mathcal{P}												\end{smallmatrix}}
	- \underbrace{ \nu \overline{\frac{\partial u'_i}{\partial  x_j}\frac{\partial u'_i}{\partial x_j}} 											}_{\begin{smallmatrix}												\text{Dissipation}\\													\varepsilon_k													\end{smallmatrix}}
	- \underbrace{ \frac{g}{\rho_o} \overline{\rho' u'_i}\delta_{i3}				}_{\begin{smallmatrix}													\text{Buoyancy flux}\\													b													\end{smallmatrix}}
&lt;/math&gt;

By examining these phenomena, the turbulence kinetic energy budget for a particular flow can be found.&lt;ref&gt;Baldocchi, D. (2005), ''[http://nature.berkeley.edu/biometlab/espm129/notes/Lecture%2016%20Wind%20and%20Turbulence%20Part%201%20Surface%20Boundary%20Layer%20Theory%20and%20Principles%20notes.pdf Lecture 16, Wind and Turbulence, Part 1, Surface Boundary Layer: Theory and Principles ]'', Ecosystem Science Division, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, CA: USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational fluid dynamics==

In [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), it is impossible to numerically simulate turbulence without discretizing the flow-field as far as the [[Kolmogorov microscales]], which is called [[direct numerical simulation]] (DNS). Because DNS simulations are exorbitantly expensive due to memory, computational and storage overheads, turbulence models are used to simulate the effects of turbulence. A variety of models are used, but generally TKE is a fundamental flow property which must be calculated in order for fluid turbulence to be modelled.

===Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations===
[[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes]] (RANS) simulations use the Boussinesq [[eddy viscosity]] hypothesis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Joseph Valentin Boussinesq|last=Boussinesq|first=J. V.|date=1877|title=Théorie de l’Écoulement Tourbillant|journal=Mem. Présentés par Divers Savants Acad. Sci. Inst. Fr.|volume=23|pages=46–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; to calculate the [[Reynolds stress]] that results from the averaging procedure:

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{u'_i u'_j} = \frac23 k \delta_{ij} - \nu_t \left( \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial \overline{u_j}}{\partial x_i} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \nu_t = c \cdot \sqrt{k} \cdot l_m. &lt;/math&gt;

The exact method of resolving TKE depends upon the turbulence model used; ''[[k-ε turbulence model|{{mvar|k}}–{{mvar|ε}}]]'' (k–epsilon) models assume isotropy of turbulence whereby the normal stresses are equal:

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{(u')^2} = \overline{(v')^2} = \overline{(w')^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This assumption makes modelling of turbulence quantities ({{mvar|k}} and {{mvar|ε}}) simpler, but will not be accurate in scenarios where anisotropic behaviour of turbulence stresses dominates, and the implications of this in the production of turbulence also leads to over-prediction since the production depends on the mean rate of strain, and not the difference between the normal stresses (as they are, by assumption, equal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurence|first=D. |date=2002 |contribution=Applications of Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equations to Industrial Flows |editor-last=van Beeck |editor-first=J. P. A. J. |editor2-last=Benocci |editor2-first=C. |title=Introduction to Turbulence Modelling, Held March 18–22, 2002 at Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics |location=[[Sint-Genesius-Rode]] |publisher=[[Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reynolds stresses|Reynolds-stress]] models (RSM) use a different method to close the Reynolds stresses, whereby the normal stresses are not assumed isotropic, so the issue with TKE production is avoided.

===Initial conditions===
Accurate prescription of TKE as initial conditions in CFD simulations are important to accurately predict flows, especially in high Reynolds-number simulations. A smooth duct example is given below.

:&lt;math&gt; k = \frac32 ( U I )^2, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|I}} is the initial turbulence intensity [%] given below, and {{mvar|U}} is the initial velocity magnitude;

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = {c_\mu}^\frac34 k^\frac32 l^{-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{mvar|l}} is the turbulence or eddy length scale, given below, and {{mvar|c&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a {{mvar|k}}–{{mvar|ε}} model parameter whose value is typically given as 0.09;

:&lt;math&gt; I = 0.16 Re^{-\frac18}. &lt;/math&gt;

The turbulent length scale can be ''estimated'' as

:&lt;math&gt; l = 0.07L, &lt;/math&gt;

with {{mvar|L}} a characteristic length.  For internal flows this may take the value of the inlet duct (or pipe) width (or diameter) or the hydraulic diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flórez Orrego |displayauthors=etal |date=2012 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gumvHDQmJD0C&amp;pg=PA302&amp;lpg=PA302&amp;dq=Experimental+and+CFD+study+of+a+single+phase+cone-shaped+helical+coiled+heat+exchanger%3A+an+empirical+correlation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c7N1itAiOI&amp;sig=-nydeNk9hXSTt8CMYSMB0hsVRlg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iTF_UfKXE6vH0AHRiYGgCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Experimental%20and%20CFD%20study%20of%20a%20single%20phase%20cone-shaped%20helical%20coiled%20heat%20exchanger%3A%20an%20empirical%20correlation&amp;f=false |chapter=Experimental and CFD study of a single phase cone-shaped helical coiled heat exchanger: an empirical correlation |title=Proceedings of ECOS 2012 – The 25th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems, June 26–29, 2012, Perugia, Italy |ISBN=978-88-6655-322-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Undergrounding''' is the replacement of [[overhead cable]]s providing [[electric power|electrical power]] or [[telecommunications]], with underground cables. This is typically performed for fire prevention and to make the power lines less susceptible to outages during high wind thunderstorms or heavy snow or ice storms. An added benefit of undergrounding is the aesthetic quality of the landscape without the powerlines. Undergrounding can increase the initial costs of electric power transmission and distribution but may decrease operational costs over the lifetime of the cables.

==History==
The first uses of undergrounding had a basis in the detonation of mining explosives and undersea telegraph cables. Power cables were used in Russia to detonate mining explosives in 1812, and to carry telegraph signals across the English Channel in 1850. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6545260/|title=History of underground power cables - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the spread of early electrical power systems, undergrounding began to increase as well. Thomas Edison used underground DC “street pipes” in his early distribution networks; they were insulated first with [[jute]] in 1880, before progressing to rubber insulation in 1882. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Subsequent developments occurred in both insulation and fabrication techniques: &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* 1925: Pressurized paper insulation used on cables
* 1903: PVC insulation used on cables
* 1942: Polyethylene insulation first used on cables
* 1962: Ethylene propylene rubber-insulated cables become commercial available 
* 1963: Preformed cable accessories become available
* 1970s: Shrinkable cable accessories become available

== Comparison ==

The aerial cables that carry [[High voltage|high-voltage]] [[electricity]] and are supported by large [[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s are generally considered an unattractive feature of the countryside. Underground cables can transmit power across densely populated areas or areas where land is costly or environmentally or aesthetically sensitive.  Underground and underwater crossings may be a practical alternative for crossing rivers.

=== Advantages ===
* Less subject to damage from severe weather conditions (mainly [[lightning]], hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons, tornados, other winds, and freezing)
* Decreased risk of fire. Overhead power lines can draw high fault currents from vegetation-to-conductor, conductor-to-conductor, or conductor-to-ground contact, which result in large, hot arcs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wildfiremitigation.tees.tamus.edu/faqs/how-power-lines-cause-wildfires|title=How Do Power Lines Cause Wildfires?|date=2014-02-13|work=Texas Wildfire Mitigation Project|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduced range of [[electromagnetic fields]] (EMF) emission, into the surrounding area. However, depending on the depth of the underground cable; greater EMF may be experienced on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emfs.info/Sources+of+EMFs/Underground/&lt;/ref&gt;    The electric current in the cable conductor produces a magnetic field, but the closer grouping of underground power cables reduces the resultant external magnetic field and further magnetic shielding may be provided. ''See [[Electromagnetic radiation and health]]''.
* Underground cables need a narrower surrounding strip of about 1–10 meters to install (up to 30 m for 400 kV cables during construction), whereas an overhead line requires a surrounding strip of about 20–200 meters wide to be kept permanently clear for safety, maintenance and repair.
* Underground cables pose no hazard to low flying aircraft or to wildlife.
* Underground cables have much less danger of conductor theft, illegal connections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To curb power theft, Maharashtra explores underground supply network across state|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-to-curb-power-theft-maharashtra-explores-underground-supply-network-across-state-2084774|website=DNA India|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; sabotage, and damage from armed conflict.
* Burying utility lines makes room for more large trees on sidewalks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestate.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article41203599.html&lt;/ref&gt; the trees conveying environmental benefits and increase of property values. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanforests.org/our-programs/urbanforests/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages ===
[[File:Bogenbach bei Baerndorf Pfahl1.JPG|thumb|right|An underground cable marker. Markers are put at regular intervals to show the route and warn of the hazard of digging into the cable.]]
*Undergrounding is more expensive, since the cost of burying cables at transmission voltages is several times greater than overhead power lines, and the life-cycle cost of an underground power cable is two to four times the cost of an overhead power line.  Above ground lines cost around $10 per foot and underground lines cost in the range of $20 to $40 per foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eei.org/ourissues/electricitydistribution/Documents/UnderVSOver.pdf Edison Electric Institute - Underground Vs. Overhead Distribution Wires: Issues to Consider]&lt;/ref&gt; In highly urbanized areas the cost of underground transmission can be 10–14 times as expensive as overhead.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power System Development Division cost estimate data&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these calculations may neglect the cost of power interruptions. The lifetime cost difference is smaller for lower-voltage distribution networks, on the range of 12-28% higher than overhead lines of equivalent voltage. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim, Kim, Cho, Song, Kweon, Chung, Choi|first=Jae-Han, Ju-Yong, Jin-Tae, Il-Keun, Bo-Min, Il-Yop, Joon-Ho|date=20 March 2014|title=Comparison between Underground Cable and Overhead Line for a Low-Voltage Direct Current Distribution Network Serving Communication Repeater|url=|journal=energies|volume=7|pages=1656-1672|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Whereas finding and repairing overhead wire breaks can be accomplished in hours, underground repairs can take days or weeks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entergy.com/2008_hurricanes/Underground-lines.pdf Should Power Lines be Underground?]&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason redundant lines are run.
*Underground cable locations are not always obvious, which can lead to unwary diggers damaging cables or being electrocuted.
*Operations are more difficult since the high [[reactive power]] of underground cables produces large charging currents and so makes voltage control more difficult.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
*Whereas overhead lines can easily be uprated by modifying line clearances and power poles to carry more power, underground cables cannot be uprated and must be supplemented or replaced to increase capacity. Transmission and distribution companies generally future-proof underground lines by installing the highest-rated cables while being still cost-effective.
*Underground cables are more subject to damage by ground movement. The [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]] in New Zealand caused damage to {{convert|360|km}} of high voltage underground cables and subsequently cut power to large parts of Christchurch city, whereas only a few kilometres of overhead lines were damaged, largely due to pole foundations being compromised by [[liquefaction]].
*An overloaded cable could melt its plastic jacket, causing flammable vapors to accumulate. The cable could then ignite the vapors.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The advantages can in some cases outweigh the disadvantages of the higher investment cost, and more expensive maintenance and management.

==Japan==
Most electrical power in Japan is still provided by aerial cables. In [[Special wards of Tokyo|Tokyo's 23 wards]], according to Japan's Construction and Transport Ministry, just 7.3 percent of cables were laid underground as of March 2008

==Europe==
The UK regulator [[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets]] (OFGEM) permits transmission companies to recoup the cost of some undergrounding in their prices to consumers. The undergrounding must be in National Parks or designated [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) to qualify. The most visually intrusive overhead cables of the core transmission network are excluded from the scheme.  Some undergrounding projects are funded by the proceeds of national lottery.

All low and medium voltage electrical power (&lt;50 kV) in the Netherlands is now supplied underground.

In Germany, 73% of the medium voltage cables are underground and 87% of low voltage cables are underground. The high fraction of underground cables contributes to the very high grid reliability (SAIDI &lt; 20). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_38837-544-1-30.pdf?140919123212&lt;/ref&gt;. In comparison, the SAIDI value (minutes without electricity per year) in the Netherlands is about 30, and in the UK it is about 70.

==California==
In the United States, the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] (CPUC) Rule 20 permits the undergrounding of electrical power cables under certain situations. Rule 20A projects are paid for by all customers of the utility companies. Rule 20B projects are partially funded this way and cover the cost of an equivalent overhead system. Rule 20C projects enable property owners to fund the undergrounding.

==Variants==
A compromise between undergrounding and using overhead lines is installing air cables. [[Aerial cable]]s are insulated cables spun between poles and used for power transmission or telecommunication services. An advantage of aerial cables is that their insulation removes the danger of electric shock (unless the cables are damaged). Another advantage is that they forgo the costs—particularly high in rocky areas—of burying. The disadvantages of aerial cables are that they have the same aesthetic issues as standard overhead lines and that they can be affected by storms. However if the insulation is not destroyed during pylon failure or when hit by a tree, there is no interruption of service. Electrical hazards are minimised and re-hanging the cables may be possible without power interruption.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2427">An '''upgrader''' is a facility that upgrades [[bitumen]] (extra heavy oil) into [[synthetic crude]] oil.  Upgrader plants are typically located close to [[oil sands]] production, for example, the [[Athabasca oil sands]] in  [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] or the [[Orinoco tar sands]] in [[Venezuela]].

==Processes==
Upgrading means using [[fractional distillation]] and/or chemical treatment to convert bitumen so it can be handled by oil refineries.  At a minimum, this means reducing its viscosity so that it can be pumped through pipelines (bitumen is 1000x more viscous than light crude oil). However this process often also includes separating out heavy fractions and reducing sulfur, nitrogen and metals like nickel and vanadium.

Upgrading may involve multiple processes:

*[[Vacuum distillation]] to separate lighter fractions, leaving behind a residue with molecular weights over 400.
*[[De-asphalter|De-asphalting]] the vacuum distillation residue to remove the highest molecular weight [[alicyclic]] compounds, which precipitate as black/brown [[asphaltene]]s when the mixture is dissolved in C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; [[alkane]]s, leaving "de-asphalted oil" (DAO) in solution. A mixture of propane and butane will remove metallic compounds that would interfere with hydrotreating.&lt;ref name="EPA_1992"&gt;{{cite book |page=107 |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastetypes/wasteid/petroleum/study_p3.pdf |date=August 1996 |title=Study of Selected Petroleum Refining Residuals |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cracking (chemistry)|Cracking]] to break long chain molecules in the DAO into shorter ones.
*[[Hydrodesulfurization|Hydrotreating]] may also be employed to remove sulfur and reduce the level of nitrogen.

Research into using [[biotechnology]] to perform some of these processes at lower temperatures and cost is ongoing.

'''Xylophagy''' is a term used in [[ecology]] to describe the habits of an [[herbivorous]] animal whose diet consists primarily (often solely) of [[wood]]. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ξυλοφάγος'' (''xulophagos'') "eating wood", from ''ξύλον'' (''xulon'') "wood" and ''φαγεῖν'' (''phagein'') "to eat", an ancient Greek name for a kind of a worm-eating bird. Animals feeding only on [[Coarse woody debris|dead wood]] are called '''[[saprophagous|sapro]]-xylophagous''' or '''saproxylic'''.

==Xylophagous insects==
Most such animals are [[arthropod]]s, primarily [[insect]]s of various kinds, in which the behavior is quite common, and found in many different [[order (biology)|orders]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ulyshen|first=Michael D.|date=2016-02-01|title=Wood decomposition as influenced by invertebrates|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12158/abstract|journal=Biological Reviews|language=en|volume=91|issue=1|pages=70–85|doi=10.1111/brv.12158|issn=1469-185X|pmid=25424353}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for insects to specialize to various degrees; in some cases, they limit themselves to certain plant groups (a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] specialization), and in others, it is the physical characteristics of the wood itself (e.g., state of decay, hardness, whether the wood is alive or dead, or the choice of [[heartwood]] versus [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] versus [[Bark (botany)|bark]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many xylophagous insects have [[symbiotic]] [[protozoa]] and/or [[bacteria]] in their [[digestive system]] which assist in the breakdown of [[cellulose]]; others (e.g., the [[termite]] family [[Termitidae]]) possess their own [[cellulase]]. Others, especially among the groups feeding on decaying wood, apparently derive much of their nutrition from the digestion of various [[fungi]] that are growing amidst the wood fibers. Such insects often carry the [[spore]]s of the fungi in special structures on their bodies (called "[[mycangium|mycangia]]"), and infect the host tree themselves when they are laying their eggs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Zeus system.jpg|300px|right|thumb|ZEUS-HLONS]]
The '''HLONS ([[HMMWV]] [[Laser]] Ordnance Neutralization System)''', commonly known as '''ZEUS''', is a [[Solid-state laser|solid-state]] [[laser weapon]] which is used by the [[U.S. military]] in order to neutralize surface [[land mines]] and [[unexploded ordnance]]. The ZEUS-HLONS system was a co-operative effort between [[Sparta Inc]] and NAVEODTECHDIV (Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division) to demonstrate that a moderate-power commercial [[solid state laser]] (SSL) and beam control system could be integrated onto a [[Humvee]] (HMMWV) and used to clear surface mines, [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs), or [[unexploded ordnance]] from supply routes and minefields.

== Features ==
[[Image:ZEUS engagement.jpg|right|thumb|ZEUS-HLONS engaging unexploded ordnance]]

ZEUS uses a 10 [[kilowatt|kW]] solid-state heat capacity (SSHC) laser beam to heat target ordnance to the point of causing the explosive filler to ignite and start to burn. Therefore, it does not depend on the type of fusing the specific ordnance uses. The resulting neutralization causes a low-level explosion that minimizes collateral damage.

It has demonstrated the capability to engage targets from 25 to 300 meters away, as long as they are in line of sight. The Zeus system can be fired up to 2,000 times a day.

The ZEUS-HLONS system offers a roll-on roll-off capability that is [[C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] and [[C-130]] transportable. It is also [[helicopter]] sling certified.

== History ==

===Development===
The two main people behind the project are Gerald Wilson (Directed Energy division of the U.S. Army [[Space and Missile Defense Command]] (SMDC)) and Owen Hofer (U.S. engineering firm SPARTA), which designed and built the system.

Prior to the ZEUS-HLONS system, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel would have to approach such munitions (either manually, or by robotic platform), place an explosive charge near it, and then detonate the charge to destroy the munitions - something they still have to do until laser neutralizing systems are commonplace. Using ZEUS is cheaper (a few cents per laser shot) and safer than the traditional method.

Lasers were theoretically evaluated for use in causing detonations of explosives in 1986 and laboratory demonstrations were done in 1987 with a 30&amp;nbsp;kW [[carbon dioxide laser|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser]].

By 1991 demonstrations were done on landmines using a 0.3&amp;nbsp;kW [[Nd:YAG]] laser and 0.8&amp;nbsp;kW CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser.

The concept of laser neutralization of ordnance was demonstrated in 1994 with the design, development and live field testing of the Mobile Ordnance Disrupter System (MODS). MODS used an [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]]A2 armored personnel carrier that supported an 1100 watt arc lamp-pumped laser system. The program was funded by the [[U.S. Air Force]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]] (Florida). This was then moved to fitting the system into a Humvee.

ZEUS is therefore the 2nd generation of this concept. Its development started in 1996 and was still undergoing upgrades and military demonstrations at the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility (HELSTF) at [[White Sands Missile Range]], New Mexico, in 2002 when it was requested to be deployed to [[Afghanistan]] (in December 2002 by General John M. Keane, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army 1999-2003).

In early 2004 the system was upgraded to a 1-kilowatt laser and then by late 2004 to a 2-kilowatt Yb:glass fibre-laser that is diode-pumped and operates in quasi-CW mode. This significantly reduced the overall system weight (removing about 2,000 pounds) and provided increased output beam power, which equates to extended range.

In January 2005, at the IQPC's Directed Energy Weapons conference in London, Gerald Wilson said the system takes between 5 seconds and 4 minutes (typically 30 seconds) to destroy a mine, resulting in a clearance rate of up to 25 explosives per hour when equipped with a 0.5&amp;nbsp;kW laser.

===Deployment===
Over its test and deployment history, ZEUS has eliminated more than 1,600 ordnance items of 40 different types with more than a 98% success rate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In March 2003, ZEUS was deployed to Afghanistan for 6 months to demonstrate its counter-mine capabilities in a combat environment ([[Operation Enduring Freedom]]). It was used at [[Bagram Air Base]] and neutralized more than 200 munitions (including 51 in one 100 minute period) of 10 different types. At the time, the ZEUS-HLONS system was a 1/2 kilowatt laser.

On March 16, 2005, ZEUS was deployed to [[Iraq]] to assist in explosive ordnance disposal activities there as part of a three-vehicle convoy protection concept.  The Zeus laser was tested and used in Iraq along MSR Tampa by a team of EOD soldiers from the 319th Ord Co (EOD), Tacoma, Washington in February and March 2005. The HLONS(Zeus) was added into the Hunter/Killer Project in an attempt to integrate EOD and Engineer resources. The project illustrated the shortcomings of the system with Counter IED (C-IED) operations. Chief among the limitations of the system was the inability to penetrate concealment materials to heat the explosives inside the ordnance, and the tendency of non EOD personnel to utilize the HLONS on all ordnance even if doing so created a more dangerous situation.

It is currently being used in Iraq by the U.S. military, in the first battlefield use of any laser weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman |first=Andrew |url=http://www.bermanpost.com/2008/11/directed-energy-weapon-zeus-now-being.html |title=Directed Energy Weapon "Zeus" Now Being Deployed |publisher=Berman Post |date=2008-11-26 |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tierney |first=John |url=http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/sci-fi-ray-gun-debuts-in-iraq/?hp |title=Sci-Fi Ray Gun Debuts in Iraq - TierneyLab Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
