{{Nihongo|'''''Ace Combat: Assault Horizon'''''|エースコンバット アサルト・ホライゾン|Ēsu Konbatto Asaruto Horaizon}} is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] installment of the ''[[Ace Combat]]'' [[Arcade game|arcade]] combat flight [[video game]] series. It was developed by [[Namco|Project Aces]] and published by [[Namco Bandai Games]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] platforms in October 2011.&lt;ref name="Announcement Trailer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6272780.html |title=Ace Combat Assault Horizon prepares for takeoff |author=Brendan Sinclair |date=August 9, 2010 |work= |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=August 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100815080639/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6272780.html| archivedate= 15 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was later released on [[Microsoft Windows]] in January 2013 through [[Steam (software)|Steam]]&lt;ref name="pcrelease" /&gt; and [[Games for Windows – Live]], with the latter notably being the final retail release for the platform shortly before its discontinuation.

The major new gameplay feature is a system called "Dogfighting mode" (DFM), which aims to increase the intensity and bring the action closer to the player. The game features two modes of control, named "Optimum"", which prevents the player from doing full rolls, and  "Original", which gives the players full control of the aircraft. Co-operative missions and free-for-all Deathmatch have returned, but two new modes named "Capital Conquest" and "Domination" were added to the game. This is also the first ''Ace Combat'' title with a plot mostly written by non-Japanese writers, with noted author Jim DeFelice at the helm. Set in 2015-2016, the game's story mainly focuses on members of the [[United Nations]]' 108th Task Force, a joint NATO-Russia military organization primarily assigned to quell a rebellion spreading over East Africa.

Announced in August 2010, ''Assault Horizon'' continued the trend of ''Ace Combat'' games set in the real Earth rather than on "Strangereal", the setting for most Ace Combat games. As a result, the game takes place in various regions, including Miami, East Africa, Moscow, and Dubai. The game received a generally positive reception upon release, with critics praising the game's settings, graphics and the soundtrack. However, some critics criticized the game for having repetitive gameplay and being overly-scripted. More than 1.07 million copies were sold worldwide upon release.

==Gameplay==

The major new gameplay feature is a system called "Close-Range Assault" (CRA), which aims to increase the intensity and bring the action closer to the player, without the feeling of "shooting at faraway dots" commonly seen in flight games. In the game, it is named "Dogfight Mode" (DFM) for air-to-air battles and "Air Strike Mode" (ASM) for air-to-ground targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acecombatassaulthorizon.namcobandaigames.eu/section/game/environnements/ |title=GAMEPLAY |author=Namco Bandai Games EU |year=2011 |work= |publisher=Namco Bandai Games EU |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not optional, as certain planes and ground targets cannot be destroyed without CRA. To initiate DFM, the player taps LB+RB on the Xbox 360 or L2+R2 on the PS3 when they have gotten close enough to the plane they are targeting. ASM is initiated by pressing the same buttons at specific points around the map. Players will also pilot other aircraft types and assume other combat aviation functions; the game introduces the B-1 and B-2 strategic bombers and the AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters as player-flyable vehicles. Certain missions may call for players to act as Black Hawk door gunners or weapons officers aboard the [[AC-130 Spectre]] gunship. Dogfight Mode  has received numerous criticisms primarily from those who have played previous Ace Combat games, saying that it has ruined the core gameplay of the game and eliminating freedom of style.

===Multiplayer===
''Assault Horizon's'' multiplayer has been improved since ''[[Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation]]''. Co-operative missions and free-for-all Deathmatch have returned, but two new modes have been added as well: "Capital Conquest" and "Domination". In Capital Conquest, two teams of 4v4 or 8v8 each take control of their own headquarters, and must destroy the other team's headquarters. First, the transmission base in the center of the map must come under one team's control; once that's accomplished, the team's multiroles and attackers (and bombers, given the right conditions) can initiate Air Strike Mode to damage the other team's HQ. The first team to destroy the other's HQ wins; if the time limit is reached before an HQ could be destroyed, then the team with the most HQ health remaining wins. On the ''Ace Combat'' website, players can join an online faction (one for each capital city featured in Capital Conquest), and any points they receive individually while playing in a certain city will go towards that player's faction's control of that city. Every six weeks, the faction with the most global control wins.

In Domination, two teams of 4v4 or 8v8 battle it out to take control of three different bases in one single city. Taking control of a base is similar to the "King of the Hill" mode in other games; when a base is neutral, one team must stay inside it for a certain amount of time to take it over. The opposing team must destroy the ground targets that now pop up around that base, and then they must stay inside for a certain amount of time to take it over. Every 60 seconds, points are awarded to each team, 1 for each base they control at the time. The team with the most points wins.

===Controls===
There are two control schemes in the game: "Optimum" and "Original."
* The new "Optimum" control scheme prevents the player from doing full rolls, to gain the stability needed to get the best of the new Close Range Assault system. This is the default mode that has been used in most of the game's media, and hasn't been seen in the series.
* The "Original" control scheme is similar to the controls in the previous titles under "Expert." It gives the players full control of the aircraft, with the left stick making it roll instead of turn.

In addition to these settings, there are many options to tweak the controls and adapt to the player's style. It includes the choice of normal or reverse settings for the Pitch Control, Camera Control, Throttle, and Yaw. High-G turns return from ''Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation'', as well as Auto Pilot if both shoulder buttons are held down. Lastly, the Flight Assistance provides opportunities to players such as Auto-leveling, Automatic Collision Prevention, Automatic Stall Prevention, Sight Assist, and Automatic Forward Target Selection. Flight Assistance can be turned on or off. On the Xbox 360, the game supports the Ace Edge Joysticks released with ''Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation''.

==Plot==

===Setting===
Unlike other games in the ''Ace Combat'' series, ''Assault Horizon'' takes place in real world locations. The story itself takes place between 2015-2016, in locations within [[East Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]].

===Characters===
The game's protagonists are mostly members of the United Nations' 108th Task Force, a joint [[NATO]]-Russian military organization primarily assigned to quell a rebellion spreading over East Africa. Players primarily assume the role of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] William Bishop, head of the [[United States Air Force]]'s Warwolf Squadron. He is assisted by wingman José "Guts" Gutierrez, NATO General Pierre La Pointe and pilots of the 108th's Nomad, Shooter, and Spooky squadrons. The antagonists are Russian General Ivan Stagleishov, and [[Russian Air Force]] pilots Andrei Markov and Maj. Sergei Illyich, who are members of a Russian criminal syndicate called the Blatnoi.

===Story===
In the prologue, USAF Lt Colonel William Bishop leads an American defense of [[Miami]] against Russian forces, but is shot down by a mysterious plane with a "shark mouth" motif; the entire sequence is revealed to be a nightmare. He later awakes and sees the survivors of a helicopter raid on an insurgent stronghold in East Africa being rushed in for treatment. Their force is wiped out after a large explosive device is set off on the stronghold by the SRN rebel group. The 108th regroups to rescue Maj. Sergei Illich, a Russian officer serving with the task force who was shot down in an earlier operation. The SRN's use of the powerful explosive leads the 108th to an SRN cave hideout near the archaeological ruins of Mogadiyu, but the 108th's Russian co-commander, General Stagleishov, holds back his forces from joining the attack and even launch their fighters. On the way back, Warwolf receives a distress call from a city under rebel attack but they are intercepted by the Russians. In the course of the battle, Bishop is shot down by Andrei Markov, a highly skilled Russian pilot who flies the same plane from Bishop's nightmare. The Russians withdraw and the rebels detonate a more powerful version of the mysterious explosive on the 108th's base just as Warwolf lands.

The 108th identifies the new weapon as "Trinity," a [[thermobaric weapon|conventional explosive]] with the power of a [[tactical nuclear weapon]] and designed for various weapon platforms such as cruise missiles. The 108th's survivors head to [[Dubai]] to defend the city from elements of the Russian criminal organization Blatnoi aiming to use the weapon on the city and intercept rebel cargo ships in hopes of finding Trinity weapons. However, this buys the Blatnoi time to launch a [[coup d'état]] in Russia with massive support from the Russian military. Under Stagleishov's command, the so-called New Russian Federation quickly takes control of [[Moscow]] and its surrounding areas, while the 108th joins other loyalist Russian units to take on the coup forces. Illich, who was one of the Russian pilots to leave East Africa, assists in the counteroffensive but disappears as the 108th successfully shoot down a Trinity [[cruise missile]] and an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] targeted for the United States. A Trinity missile destroys much of the 108th's strike force heading to Moscow and Bishop leads Warwolf in shooting down a Russian bomber squadron bearing down on the capital; he also takes out Markov's personal plane and the pilot ejects. Seeing the futility of resistance, Stagleishov negotiates the NRF's surrender by exchanging the final Trinity missile for political immunity, but Markov kills him and steals the weapon. It is revealed that Markov planned everything as revenge against the US for an airstrike during the [[Bosnian War]] that killed his wife, with the coup as a decoy to lure many American forces out of the homeland and weaken its defenses.

Illich is revealed as Markov's sleeper agent and betrays the 108th by joining his forces bound for the U.S. from bases in South America. The 108th and several American combat units reinforce and defend Miami against an onslaught by Markov's forces. Bishop's earlier nightmare comes to life but Guts is able to protect him and the Trinity missile on Markov's plane is damaged in the process. Bishop then chases after an escaping Markov and Illich and encounters them in midst of a [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale#Category 5|Category 5 hurricane]], Markov escapes while Illich covers his retreat, after a long and difficult battle Bishop finally overcomes Illich. The 108th recovers and assists in the defense of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]] against a larger Russian attack. In a final showdown, Bishop finally eliminates Markov and shoots down his Trinity missile aimed at the White House. Upon landing his plane at [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan National Airport]], Bishop is given a hero's welcome while Guts is safely rescued.

==Development==
The game was first hinted at by a trademark filing by Namco Bandai in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/04/26/ace-combat-assault-horizon-soaring-to-consoles/ |title=Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Soaring To Consoles? |author=Spencer |date=April 26, 2010 |website=Siliconera |accessdate=August 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704054616/http://www.siliconera.com/2010/04/26/ace-combat-assault-horizon-soaring-to-consoles/| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially announced along with a gameplay trailer on August 9, 2010. Gameplay has been expanded to include the use of helicopters and gunships as well. The trailer showed the player using an [[AH-64D]] Apache Longbow gunship, and occupying the gunner's position on the [[UH-60]] Black Hawk while attacking a desert village. In the trailer the [[US Air Force]] is engaged in dogfighting with Russian fighters over [[Miami]]. The player is in an [[F-22]] engaging and destroying several enemies before being shot down himself. Pierre La Pointe, the French commander of the 108th Task Force, briefs the Task Force on an Ace leading the attack on Miami named Col. Markov who has been nicknamed [[wikt:акула|Akula]] (Russian for shark) because of the design on the nose of his plane. Russian involvement in the conflict has been described as "advisers and mercenaries" in the E3 Trailer. Another scene showed a US [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]] attacking a fleet of naval ships.&lt;ref name="Announcement Trailer"/&gt; The extended trailer had additional scenes of air battles with the player flying an [[F-35]] and an [[F-16]] over [[Dubai]] and an attack on a desert oil facility. It is also revealed that the time is sometime in 2015 and will also take place in East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.dengeki.com/elem/000/000/334/334439/|title= 瞬間が生死を分けるドッグファイト！ 『エースコンバット アサルト・ホライゾン』 |author=Dengeki Online |date=March 2, 2011 |work= |website=Dengeki Online |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ace Combat: Assault Horizon'' continues the trend of ''Ace Combat'' games set in the real Earth rather than on "Strangereal", the setting for most ''Ace Combat'' games. The game takes place over a number of locations, including: [[Miami]], [[East Africa]], [[Dubai]] and the [[Middle East]], Russia ([[Derbent]], the [[Black Sea]], [[Caucasus]], and [[Moscow]] specifically), and [[Washington, D.C.]]. Fictional towns and cities were also used, including Mogadiyu, Carruth, and Belyi Base (believed to be based on [[Belaya (air base)|Belaya]]). The developers used satellite imagery to accurately render the real-life locations, making it possible for players to pick out actual buildings and locations while playing the game. Miami, East Africa, Dubai, Moscow, and Washington, D.C. are available in multiple multiplayer modes alongside [[Paris]]. [[Honolulu]] and [[Tokyo]] were added as downloadable maps.

A demo was released on September 13, 2011. All PlayStation 3 players could download it for free; however, Xbox 360 players needed to have Xbox LIVE Gold for the first week in order to download it; it then migrated to Xbox LIVE Silver as well. The demo included Mission 1 and Mission 3, with the iconic nightmare air battle over Miami from the trailers and the attack helicopter rescue operation in Africa, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/222865/two-mission-ace-combat-assault-horizon-demo-out-today|title=Two-Mission Ace Combat Assault Horizon Demo Out Today|author=GamePro|date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=September 16, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/222865/two-mission-ace-combat-assault-horizon-demo-out-today&amp;date=2011-11-30+19:05:40|archivedate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has since been removed and no longer able for other players to download.

[[Macross]] creator Shouji Kawamori designed a fictional plane for the game, the "ASF-X Shinden II", which was released on October 25, 2011 and is currently being offered as downloadable content. It can be purchased in the PlayStation Store for $7.99 USD or in the Xbox Marketplace for 640 MS Points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2011/06/20/macross_ace_combat_jet/ |title=First Look: Macross Creator's Ace Combat Jet |author=Anoop Gantayat |date=June 20, 2011 |work= |website=AndriaSang |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630223727/http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2011/06/20/macross_ace_combat_jet/ |archivedate=June 30, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PC version is available through retailers as well as [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[Games for Windows Marketplace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamersyndrome.com/2012/ps3/ace-combat-assault-horizon-coming-pc-in-2013/|title=Ace Combat Assault Horizonn Coming to PC in Q1 2013|author=joar|date=2012-11-28|website=Gamersyndrome|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603061122/http://gamersyndrome.com/2012/ps3/ace-combat-assault-horizon-coming-pc-in-2013/|archivedate=2013-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has garnered mixed to positive reviews. [[Metacritic]] gives the game a 78 out of 100 (based on 71 reviews) for the Xbox 360 release,&lt;ref name="MCXbox"/&gt; a 77 out of 100 (based on 28 reviews) for the PlayStation 3 release,&lt;ref name="MCPS3"/&gt; and a 77/100 for the Enhanced Edition on PC.&lt;ref name = "MCPC"/&gt;

Critics praised the real-world settings, graphics and the soundtrack, but criticized the game for being repetitive and overly scripted. Critics also praised the voice-acting of the characters. Reception from the audience has also been positive; users on Metacritic give a 6.8/10 for the Xbox 360 and a 7.2/10 for the PS3, with some gamers feeling that the new gameplay elements kept the series "fresh and exciting". IGN gave Assault Horizon a 7.5/10, praising the game for keeping the arcade-like controls to make it easy to jump into. The editor noted that this was more like a spin-off than an actual part of the series, especially since it didn't have a number; however, it was again criticized for its repetition in the new Close Range Assault systems.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; GameSpot gave the game a 5.5/10&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; and 1UP gave it a D+,&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt; finding some of these criticized features to be what ruined the game's potential, and comparing the game to the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series.

In response to the initial mostly positive response, Namco Bandai Games created a special "Accolades Trailer" one month after the game's release, in which many of the positive comments from well-known reviewers are featured alongside gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=November 17, 2011 |title=ACE COMBAT® ASSAULT HORIZON ACCOLADES TRAILER |type=Trailer |publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfdDsmNtmmg}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 8, 2012, the game has sold 1.07 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/dark-souls-sells-119-million-6375675 |title=Dark Souls sells 1.19 million |author=Brendan Sinclair |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=May 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alive II''''' is the second [[live album]] (and eighth overall) by American [[hard rock]] band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], released on October 14, 1977 by [[Casablanca Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kissonline.com/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had released three albums (''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'', ''[[Rock and Roll Over]]'', and ''[[Love Gun]]'') since the previous live outing, the  1975 release ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Alive!]]'', and the band drew upon the variety of new tracks, with [[Eddie Kramer]] producing.

==Album information==
The origins of ''Alive II'' go back to early 1977 when the band's manager [[Bill Aucoin]] suggested that Kramer record a live album during the evening show at [[Budokan Hall]] in Tokyo, Japan on April 2, 1977. The plan was to release a live album to give Kiss some much deserved time off before recording the album that would become ''[[Love Gun]]'' later that autumn. Kramer finished work on the album, but Casablanca and Kiss deemed it unusable, and the band forged ahead with their ''Love Gun'' sessions.

Most of the live tracks on ''Alive II'' were recorded during the band's August 26–28 shows at the [[Great Western Forum|Forum]] while on their [[Love Gun Tour]]. The 3 p.m. soundchecks at the August 26 and 27 shows were recorded, and later used on the album (i.e. "I Stole Your Love") with crowd noise being dubbed in later. "[[Beth (song)|Beth]]" and "I Want You" were lifted from the aborted Japanese live album and used on the finished ''Alive II''. As the band did not want to duplicate songs included on ''Alive!'', the songs chosen for the three live sides of the album were all drawn from Kiss' three preceding studio albums: ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'', ''[[Rock and Roll Over]]'' and ''[[Love Gun]]''.

On the original double album, the songs on side 4 (tracks 6–10 on the second CD) are studio tracks recorded September 13–16, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kiss Alive! 1975-2000]] cd liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Ace Frehley]] was originally credited for lead guitar on the studio tracks, the remastered version released in 1997 confirmed what had been speculated by Kiss fans for years: [[Bob Kulick]] actually played lead guitar on three tracks ("All American Man", "Rockin' in the U.S.A." and "Larger Than Life"), not Frehley. Frehley's sole involvement for the studio songs was "[[Rocket Ride (song)|Rocket Ride]]" (originally written for a solo album&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/kissaliveacts.htm |title=No Life 'til Metal – CD Gallery – Alive Facts! |publisher=Nolifetilmetal.com |date=1977-10-24 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;), on which he sang lead vocals and played both guitar and bass guitar. [[Paul Stanley]] played all guitars on "[[Any Way You Want It (The Dave Clark Five song)|Any Way You Want It]]", which was originally recorded by the [[Dave Clark Five]] in 1964.

Several early copies of the album's cover featured a rare misprint of three additional songs ("Take Me", "Hooligan" and "Do You Love Me?") with a slightly altered song order. None of these additional songs appeared on the LP. On the misprint, "Take Me" is after "[[Detroit Rock City]]", with "King of the Night Time World" appearing after "Ladies Room" on Side 1. Side two features "Hooligan" after "[[Shock Me]]", which is placed after "Hard Luck Woman". On Side 3, "Do You Love Me?" appears after "God of Thunder", with "Beth" sandwiched between "I Want You" and "[[Shout It Out Loud (Kiss song)|Shout It Out Loud]]". "Hooligan" and "Take Me" were performed on the 1977 ''Love Gun'' tour, and "Do You Love Me?" was performed on the Japanese tour that same year, making their consideration for inclusion with the second live album possible.

==Promotional items==
The original vinyl issue of ''Alive II'' was a 2-LP set with a gatefold cover and picture inner sleeves. Continuing the Kiss tradition of including promotional items with their albums, ''Alive II'' was packaged with a full-color booklet titled "The Evolution of Kiss" and a set of temporary transfer tattoos in a cartoon style. The tattoos depicted the band logo, Kiss Army logo, band member heads, member signatures and symbols. The symbols were meant to represent the four personas of the group and included a [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]] for [[Gene Simmons]], a rose and star with eye for Stanley, a [[Saturn]]-like planet and block print-style "ACE" for Frehley, and a drum and cat's head for [[Peter Criss]]. The rose and "ACE" are copies of Stanley and Frehley's actual tattoos, respectively. A merchandise order form was also included with the album, listing an array of official Kiss merchandise as well as a chance to "enlist" in the Kiss Army. The inner sleeves depicted crazed Kiss fans in a confetti storm and the band's album discography to date.

==Re-release==
''Alive II'' was originally reissued as a double-CD set in what has now become known as a "fatboy" 2CD case. When the Kiss back catalog was remastered, it was housed in a slimline 2CD case and, in keeping with the rest of the reissue program, had the artwork restored. This included the set of tattoos. The booklet "The Evolution of Kiss"' and the picture inner sleeves were incorporated as part of the CD booklet. ''Alive II'' was re-released in 2006 as part of ''[[Kiss Alive! 1975-2000]]''. It included "[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]" (single edit version) as a bonus track. The short running time of ''Alive II'' allowed for a single CD edition in the latest release.

==Reception==
Coming off of a period of extensive touring, ''Alive II'' received a huge fan response and critical acclaim, reaching the No. 7 spot on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. The album has received praise from several critics. In a retrospective review, critic Greg Parto of [[AllMusic]] remarked that several tracks such as "Detroit Rock City", "Shock Me" and "Shout It Out Loud" featured an "adrenaline-charged" vibe. He lauded the album for showing the group in its element as an "exciting live band".&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

'''Amir Hossain Babu''' was a Bangladeshi dancer and choreographer. He earned [[Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Choreography]] a record two times : in 1992 for [[Beparoya]] and in 2001 for [[Meghla Akash]].

==Career==
Babu was the first who discovered actor [[Ferdous Ahmed]]. In 1997, following the death of [[Salman Shah]], he scheluded to make a dance based film named ''Nach Moyuri Nach''. Since, Shah was dead untimely, he needed a new hero. So, he auditioned for a new hero and chose Ferdous for the role. The shooting began initially, but the film was shelved. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daily-sun.com/home/printnews/225598|title=Ferdous Ahmed got his first break from Amir Hossain Babu|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anywhere Festival''' is an annual [[Brisbane]] based [[festival]] for [[performance]] anywhere but traditional theatre spaces. The first anywhere-but-in-a-traditional-theatre concept was brought to Brisbane in 2011 by creative director Paul Osuch and his partner, [[Ally McTavish]]. Their theory is that we need to take traditional story-telling out of theatre buildings and back to where life really takes place, in the community.&lt;ref name="crikey1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cotes |first=Alison |url=http://dailyreview.crikey.com.au/anywhere-theatre-festival-brisbane/6047 |title=Anywhere Theatre Festival reviews (Brisbane) &amp;#124; Daily Review: film, stage and music reviews, interviews and more |publisher=Dailyreview.crikey.com.au |date=2014-05-12 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival – which holds performances anywhere but in a traditional theatre – began in 2011 with 4000 attendees and 31 productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natalie Bochenski |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/going-anywhere-festivals-future-in-doubt-20130507-2j5ls.html |title=Going anywhere? Festival's future in doubt |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2014-10-30 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since it began, the Anywhere Festival (they dropped the "Theatre" in 2015) has grown in size and popularity as it inhabited the nooks and crannies of this city of ours &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2014/03/the-anywhere-theatre-festvial-takes-over-brisbane.html?site=brisbane&amp;program=612_drive |title=The Anywhere Theatre Festvial takes over Brisbane - ABC Queensland - Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |publisher=Blogs.abc.net.au |date=2014-03-11 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea behind Anywhere is that the art of theatre should not be constrained by, well, a theatre nor by a time frame of two plus hours with interval, or even a genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mustdobrisbane.com/archives/anywhere-theatre-festival-2014-brisbane |title=Anywhere Theatre Festival 2014 Brisbane |publisher=Must do Brisbane |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea behind Anywhere Festival is that you don't - you shouldn't - have to go to a traditional theatre space to see theatre. You shouldn't have to pay a lot of money for tickets, and artists shouldn't be limited by space or cost or time. For 10 days this month, you can see exciting theatre in parks, backyards, bedrooms, lifts, trains and even on Twitter, not just in Brisbane but as far away as Toowoomba to the west, and Yandina to the north.&lt;ref name="couriermail1"&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/all-the-worlds-a-stage-for-festival/story-fn6ck8la-1226347510552] {{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The festival is about theatre anywhere but in a theatre," explains Paul Osuch, the mastermind behind the festival. He started Anywhere with his wife, Alex McTavish. "I could see people wanted exciting theatre that didn't have to happen in a theatre," he says. "What kicked it over the line was when English actor Ian McKellen couldn't find a theatre space in Brisbane to bring his acclaimed Waiting for Godot. I figured that if he had trouble getting into a Brisbane theatre there were probably a lot of less-well-known theatre producers with the same problem." &lt;ref name="couriermail1"/&gt;

It wasn't just a lack of available theatre venues that prompted him to act. Osuch says he found many traditional theatre spaces were restrictive, both for audiences and artists, and smothered in an air of "elitism" that was turning people away.&lt;ref name="couriermail1"/&gt;

"I find that most performances in a theatre space are just a little sterile. And parking's difficult, the drinks are generally overpriced and, as someone over the height of six foot, I'm not a big fan of theatre seating where I have to watch a show through the gap in my knees," he says. "I feel that the traditional theatre spaces stop more people going to experience it than it regularly attracts.

The '''Australian Script Centre''' has been selectively collecting, promoting and distributing contemporary [[Australian play]]s in [[manuscript]] form since 1979. It is recognised by the [[Australia Council]] for the Arts as a Key Organisation providing essential infrastructure services to the [[theatre]] sector. The Centre's work supports playwrights in particular by filling the gap left by the very small number of Australian plays that achieve commercial publication. Its [[ecommerce]] website, '''australianplays.org''', gives playwrights a global distribution and marketing network for their work as well as giving producers everywhere a simple access point for professionally written and production-ready Australian plays.

The ASC is a [[non-profit]] association with a membership base comprising a diverse community of theatre makers, including many [[playwright]]s, [[drama]] educators, students, theatre companies and producers.

The Australian Script Centre is the only national arts organisation based in [[Tasmania]]. It grew out of an initiative of Barbara Manning and the Salamanca Theatre Company, called the Salamanca National Script Resource Centre. Initially the centre was a distribution service for playwrights writing for theatre-in-education. It ran successfully throughout the 1980s and in 1993 separated from the Salamanca Theatre Company to become the Australian Script Centre. The centre's collection rapidly grew as it began to incorporate all styles of play and radio scripts. It now houses the largest and most comprehensive collection of unpublished contemporary Australian playscripts in the world. This represents a significant cultural and historical resource.

{{nihongo|'''''Azumi'''''|あずみ|lead=yes}} is a [[manga]] series created by [[Yū Koyama]] in 1994. Its story concerns the title character, a young woman brought up as part of a team of [[Assassination|assassins]], charged with killing the [[warlord]]s that threaten the uneasy peace in [[Feudal Japan]] in the aftermath of its long [[Sengoku period|Sengoku]] civil war period.

''Azumi'' was originally published by [[Shogakukan]] and serialized in ''[[Big Comic Superior]]'', and received an Excellence Prize at the 1997 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] and the [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="ShogakukanAward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |script-title=ja:小学館漫画賞: 歴代受賞者 |publisher=Shogakukan |language=Japanese |accessdate=2007-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094941/http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manga was later adapted to two feature films starring [[Aya Ueto]] (2003's ''[[Azumi (film)|Azumi]]'' and 2005's ''[[Azumi 2: Death or Love]]''), and a video game and a stage play in 2005.

== Plot ==
''Azumi'' focuses upon the life of the titular young female assassin. The manga begins an indeterminate number of years after the [[Battle of Sekigahara]]. As Azumi begins her duty, the manga introduces its characters into mainstream history. Many of the early missions that Azumi undertakes are the assassinations of the prominent supporters and generals of the [[Toyotomi clan]], against whom [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] expected to again go to war. The manga "reveals" that many of the Toyotomi leaders who conveniently died of diseases or accidents prior to the final confrontation between the Toyotomi and Tokugawa were actually victims of assassinations by Azumi and her comrades, thus indicating to the reader when the events were taking place.

Azumi is raised by an old man known as Jiji (Grandfather), whose name is later revealed to be Gensai Obata, as the only girl among ten students. They are secluded from the society in a tiny valley called Kiridani (Fog Valley) to such an extent that they do not know the difference between men and women, what a baby is, or customs like marriage. Early in the manga, as part of their training, Azumi and her comrades are ordered to go to Shimotani, a hidden community of ninja who became farmers, to learn the basics of [[ninjutsu]]. The manga sets a very chilling tone early on. The 10 ''erabareta senshi'' (chosen warriors), who are all young children (Azumi has her first period well after her first missions, so she appears to be somewhere between 10–12 years of age at the onset of the manga) are told by Jiji that they have completed their training. For their first mission, they are to form a pair with whomever among the 10 that they feel the closest. Azumi pairs with Nachi, and all others pair with their closest friends. Having formed the pairs, Jiji tells them their first mission is to kill their partner—whoever is too weak to kill their partner is too weak to fulfill their life's missions, and will not be allowed to survive. The ten children each fight their respective duels, and Azumi slays Nachi, an event which appears to deeply traumatize Azumi, but she hides her feelings, as do the others. Then, their second mission was to massacre all 53 residents of the peaceful ninja village, including their teacher, women and children, as they know of the group's existence. Azumi slays three men and four teenagers but is unable to kill a woman with baby, a task which one of her comrades quickly accomplishes.

The remaining five warriors proceed to go on assassination missions of the various important supporters of the Toyotomi faction. As the manga proceeds, it evokes various moral concepts such as the morality of assassinations (and killing in general), the dehumanization effect of politics, as well as leading the reader to question basic assumptions of right and wrong. For example, throughout much of the middle volumes of the manga (Vol. 8-19), Azumi frequently fights and kills many bandits—many of whom are depicted robbing, murdering, and raping innocent victims. Azumi does not question that her killing such bandits is right, and few readers probably question her righteousness. Later on in the manga, the political background to the reason for the banditry is revealed. The Tokugawa ruling family deposed and ended many previously prominent ''[[daimyō]]'' feudal lords who opposed them leaving the samurai and mercenaries in their employ without work or any means to live—therefore they resorted to banditry. Azumi questions whether it was right for her to have killed so many men who had been driven to banditry not by their own choice.

A consistent recurring theme is the contrast between Azumi and other prominent characters. Azumi is compared to a bodhisattva—a kind of enlightened being. This is indicative of the theme in Azumi where characters around Azumi are motivated by a variety of obsessions. Some are motivated by a kind of blind idealism, others by religion, others by a lust for battle, greed, or even normally sanctified motivations like honor. Not all the forces (particularly those motivated by more noble incentives, like a pair of ninja assassins whom Azumi kills, who are participating in the planning of a revolt as the only way for a ninja community to survive) are depicted as if their single-minded drive towards their goals are somehow evil. However, nonetheless, in each case, those who are attached intensely to something in the world are killed by Azumi, while she, who seemingly has little attachment to the earthly world and few personal desires, survives.

'''''Battleship''''' is a 2012 American [[military science fiction]] [[action film]] loosely based on the [[board game]] [[Battleship (game)|of the same name]]. The film was directed by [[Peter Berg]] and starred [[Taylor Kitsch]], [[Brooklyn Decker]], [[Rihanna]], [[Tadanobu Asano]], [[Alexander Skarsgård]], and [[Liam Neeson]]. Filming took place in [[Hawaii]] and on {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}. In the film, a fleet of ships are forced to do battle with an armada of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin in order to thwart their destructive goals.

''Battleship'' premiered in Tokyo on April 3, 2012 and received a wide release by [[Universal Pictures]] on May 18. It received mixed to negative reviews and underperformed at the box office, making only $65 million in North America against its total gross of $303 million worldwide.

==Plot==

In 2005, the distant [[Gliese 581|Gliese planetary system]] is discovered to have a potentially [[Habitable zone|habitable planet]] and a communications array is built by [[NASA]] in [[Hawaii]] to send a transmission to contact any [[Extraterrestrial life|intelligent life]]. Meanwhile, Alex Hopper is arrested while attempting to impress Sam Shane. His brother, naval officer Stone, forces Alex to join the [[U.S. Navy]] in order to improve his life.

In 2012, Alex and Sam are in a relationship; Alex serves as a Tactical Actions Officer as a [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] aboard {{USS|John Paul Jones|DDG-53|6}} while Stone is the commander aboard {{USS|Sampson|DDG-102|6}}, but Alex is in danger of receiving a disciplinary [[military discharge|discharge]]. During the [[Exercise RIMPAC#RIMPAC 2012|2012 RIMPAC exercise]], five alien spacecraft arrive. Their communications ship collides with a satellite and crashes in [[Hong Kong]] while the other four land in the waters off Hawaii. ''Sampson'', ''John Paul Jones'', and their Japanese sister ship [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JDS]] {{ship|JDS|Myōkō||2}} are ordered by Admiral Terrance Shane to investigate, and they discover a floating structure. When it is touched by Alex it generates a [[force shield|force field]] that encloses the Hawaiian Islands and separates the three ships from the fleet. Three alien warships surface and commence to engage both the ''Sampson'' and ''Myōkō'' which are destroyed, resulting in Stone's death, while the command crew of ''John Paul Jones'' are killed. With Alex assuming command as the ranking officer, they recover the survivors from ''Myōkō'' including its commanding officer, Captain Yugi Nagata. The aliens also launch drones to attack Hawaii which cause heavy damage.

On Oahu, Sam is accompanying retired [[U.S. Army]] Colonel and double amputee Mick Canales on a mountain hike. After becoming aware of the aliens' presence, they encounter scientist Cal Zapata who informs them the aliens have taken over the communications array, and Mick determines that they are planning to use it to re-establish military communications with their home planet. Aboard ''John Paul Jones'', naval personnel capture a semi-conscious alien. The alien forms a telepathic link with Alex, showing him their history of destroying worlds. Other aliens arrive and retrieve their comrade, but are prevented from sabotaging the ship. Examination of the captured alien's helmet reveals the aliens are sensitive to sunlight. Ashore, Sam, Nick and Zapata recover his [[spectrum analyzer]] from the aliens and they use it to radio ''John Paul Jones'' to inform them the aliens intend military telecommunication with their home planet in four hours.

Captain Nagata suggests to use [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[tsunami warning system|tsunami warning buoys]] around Hawaii to track the alien warships. This allows ''John Paul Jones'' to destroy two of them. At dawn, they lure the remaining warship eastwards as Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows, blinding its crew and allowing ''John Paul Jones'' to destroy it, but ''John Paul Jones'' is subsequently sunk by alien drones.

The survivors return to Pearl Harbor and commandeer the previously decommissioned World War II [[battleship]] {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} with the aid of the retired veterans preserving her, restoring her to battle readiness and confronting the floating structure, revealed to be a giant mothership. ''Missouri'' is able to severely damage the mothership and disable the force field, while Admiral Shane scrambles a flight of [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|Boeing F/A-18]] fighter jets from aircraft carrier {{USS|Ronald Reagan|CVN-76|6}}. Meanwhile, Sam, Mick and Cal attempt to stall the aliens at the communications array. As the mothership rallies against ''Missouri'', Alex uses their last shell to destroy the communications array. All hope is lost for ''Missouri'' and those onboard until the Australian fighter jets arrive in time and destroy the mothership, saving ''Missouri'' and eliminating the alien threat.

A ceremony is held to honor the military personnel, where Alex is promoted to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] and presented with both a [[Silver Star]] and his brother's posthumous [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]. After the ceremony, Alex asks Sam's father Admiral Shane for her hand in marriage. The admiral initially refuses, but then invites Alex to lunch to discuss the matter.

In a [[post-credits scene]], three teenagers and a [[handyman]] in Scotland discover a crashed alien pod. When they open it, an alien hand reaches out, and they run off in terror.

The film marks the reunion between former co-stars Kitsch and Jesse Plemons, who previously worked together on Berg's TV series ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]''. Berg said he loves working with friends and explained he knew how comfortable Kitsch was with Plemons, "I know that he’s really good for Taylor and he makes Taylor better. So, I wrote that whole part for Jesse." He added, "I never thought of it as a ''Friday Night Lights'' reunion. I thought of it as protection, bringing a trusted family member in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Radish|first=Christina|title=Brooklyn Decker and Director Peter Berg Talk BATTLESHIP, Naval Warfare and the Design of the Aliens at WonderCon|url=http://collider.com/brooklyn-decker-peter-berg-battleship-interview/153633/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=April 15, 2012|date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his success with the ''[[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]'' franchise, composer [[Steve Jablonsky]] was chosen to score the official soundtrack. The soundtrack features original compositions from Jablonsky and features rock guitarist [[Tom Morello]] from [[Rage Against The Machine]]. Director Peter Berg stated:

{{quote|Working with composers often is a really frustrating experience because you speak a different language and, oftentimes, they take two or three jobs, at the same time. They're difficult and pretentious and they're tormented artists. I'm not going to name names, but most of them are. One guy who isn't is [[Hans Zimmer]], who taught Steve Jablonsky. We had a couple of meetings and I came up with this idea. The day I met with him, I had had an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] for my neck, and they make that really scary sound. I was like, 'I just had this MRI, and when I was in there, I was thinking about the aliens, and it was really scary.' And he was like, 'Oh, that's awesome!' He went and recorded MRIs and made music out of MRIs, and that's the theme of the aliens in our film. He is no drama, and just goes and gets it done. The score is big and awesome and scary and driving. At times, it's very simple and acoustic and touching and emotional. He's the best I've ever worked with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/brooklyn-decker-peter-berg-battleship-interview/153633/ |title=Brooklyn Decker and Director Peter Berg Talk BATTLESHIP, Naval Warfare and the Design of the Aliens at WonderCon |publisher=Collider |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Critical reception===
[[Metacritic]] has given the film an average score of 41 out of 100 based on 39 reviews meaning "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/battleship |title=Battleship |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate= January 14, 2014 | quote = Mixed or average reviews }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 34% based on reviews from 217 critics, with a rating average of 4.6/10. The site's consensus reads: "It may offer energetic escapism for less demanding filmgoers, but ''Battleship'' is too loud, poorly written, and formulaic to justify its expense -- and a lot less fun than its source material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/battleship/ |title=Battleship  |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]  |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many reviews criticised the "based on a board game" concept driving the film, although some, such as Jason Di Rosso from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[Radio National]], claimed the ridiculousness of the setup is "either sheer joy or pure hell – depending on how seriously you take it", while de Semlyen "had to admire [the film's creators] jumping through hoops to engineer a sequence that replicates the board game."&lt;ref name=deSemlyen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hardie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/movietime/battleship/3946780 |title=Battleship |last=Di Rosso |first=Jason |date=April 12, 2012 |work=MovieTime|publisher=[[Radio National]] ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several compared the film to [[Michael Bay]]'s ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' film series in terms of quality and cinematic style, with Giles Hardie of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' claiming that the movie "finds the same balance between action-packed imagination and not taking the premise seriously that made Michael Bay's original ''Transformers'' such a joyride."&lt;ref name=Lehmann/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hardie&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/realism-sinks-without-a-trace-but-guns-aliens-and-rihanna-triumph-20120411-1ws3c.html |title=Battleship movie review |last=Hardie |first=Giles |date=April 12, 2012 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Harrison of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine called the film "crushingly stupid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.qthemusic.com/2012/04/film_review_-_battleship_this.html|accessdate=April 30, 2012|date=April 11, 2012|title=Film review – Battleship: This brainless Rihanna vehicle deserves to be scuttled without delay|author=Andrew Harrison|publisher=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419205145/http://news.qthemusic.com/2012/04/film_review_-_battleship_this.html|archivedate=April 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Kenneth Turan, in a review written for the ''Los Angeles Times'', also expressed disappointment, criticizing the film's "humanoid aliens", stating that they are "as ungainly as the movie itself, clunking around in awkward, protective suits." He called the content "all very earnest", but added "it's not a whole lot of fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=Movie review: Aliens can have this 'Battleship'|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-battleship-20120518,0,6752668.story|publisher=L.A. Times|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film one out of four stars, and he comment "Battleship is all noise and crashing metal, sinking to the shallows of Michael Bay's Armageddon and then digging to the brain-extinction level of the Transformers trilogy."

Other critics were less harsh for ''Battleship'': Writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Steven James Snyder was somewhat positive because he had low expectations of the film. He wrote, "The creative team behind this ocean-bound thriller decided to fill the narrative black hole with a few ingredients all but absent from today’s summer tent poles – namely mystery, nostalgia and a healthy dose of humility" and described it as "an unlikely mix of ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battleship: More Fun Than a Board Game Blockbuster Has Any Right to Be|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/17/battleship-more-fun-than-a-board-game-blockbuster-has-any-right-to-be/#ixzz1vA22YnP7|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=May 18, 2012|author=Steven James Snyder|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving it a B+ grade, Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''  said, "For every line of howler dialogue that should have been sunk, there's a nice little scene in which humans have to make a difficult decision.

'''William Thomas "Billy" Murray''' (May 25, 1877 – August 17, 1954) was one of the most popular singers in the United States in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|title=Billy Murray|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-murray-p375938|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he received star billing in [[vaudeville]], he was best known for his prolific work in the recording studio, making records for almost every [[record label]] of the era.

==Life and career==
Billy Murray was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] to Patrick and Julia (Kelleher) Murray, immigrants from [[County Kerry]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;US Census, 1880, 24th Ward, District 21, Philadelphia, PA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Murray: A Biography|url=http://www.denvernightingale.com/biography.html|work=The Official Website of Billy Murray (1877-1954)|publisher=Phonostalgia |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents moved to [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1882, where he grew up. He became fascinated with the theater and joined a traveling vaudeville troupe in 1893. He also performed in [[minstrel show]]s early in his career. In 1897 Murray made his first recordings for Peter Bacigalupi, the owner of a phonograph company in San Francisco. As of 2010 none of Murray's cylinder records with Bacigalupi are known to have survived.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt; In 1903, he started recording regularly in New York City and [[New Jersey]] area, where major record companies in the U.S. as well as the [[Tin Pan Alley]] music industry were concentrated.

In 1906, he recorded the first of his popular duets with [[Ada Jones]]. He also performed with [[Aileen Stanley]], the [[Haydn Quartet (vocal ensemble)|Haydn Quartet]], the [[American Quartet (ensemble)|American Quartet]] (also known as the Premier Quartet), and [[Elsie Baker]] as well as performed solo work.

Nicknamed "The Denver Nightingale", Murray had a strong [[tenor]] voice with excellent enunciation and a conversational delivery compared with [[bel canto]] singers of the era. On comic songs, he often deliberately sang slightly flat, which he felt helped the comic effect. Although he often performed romantic numbers and ballads which sold well, his comedy and [[novelty song]] recordings continue to be popular with later generations of record collectors.
[[File:BillyMurrayEmerson1919.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Billy Murray newspaper ad from 1919]]
Murray was a devoted baseball fan, and he is said to have played with the [[New York Yankees|New York Highlanders (Yankees)]] in exhibition games. He also supposedly sometimes called in sick to recording sessions in order to go to the ballpark. Murray recorded "Tessie, You Are the Only, Only, Only", which became the unofficial theme of the [[1903 World Series]], when the words were changed from "Tessie, you know I love you madly" to "[[Honus Wagner|Honus]], why do you hit so badly?"

Murray's popularity faded as public taste changed and recording technology advanced; the rise of the electric [[microphone]] in the mid-1920s coincided with the era of the [[crooner]]s. His "hammering" style, as he called it, essentially yelling the song into an acoustic recording horn, did not work in the electrical era, and he had to learn to soften his voice.

Though his singing style was less in demand, he continued to find recording work. By the late 1920s and early 1930s, the music from his early days was considered nostalgic, and Murray was in demand again. He did voices for [[animated cartoon]]s, especially the popular "follow the bouncing ball" sing-along cartoons and the [[Fleischer Studios]] character [[Bimbo (Fleischer)|Bimbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Murray made his last recordings for Beacon Records on February 11, 1943 with Jewish dialect comedian [[Monroe Silver]]. He retired the next year to [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]], [[Long Island]], New York because of heart problems. He died at nearby [[Jones Beach State Park|Jones Beach]] of a heart attack in 1954 at the age of 77. Murray had married three times, the first two ending in divorce. He was survived by his third wife, Madeleine, and is buried in the [[Cemetery of the Holy Rood]] in [[Westbury, New York]].&lt;ref name=biography /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Decades later, "You're a Grand Old Rag", and "Shine On, Harvest Moon", two of his songs would be heard in [[BioShock Infinite]]. the former being heard faintly in one of the reveal trailers, and the latter being heard in The Fellow Traveller Pub.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''''C.O.P. The Recruit''''' is a video game published by [[Ubisoft]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. The game was announced at [[E3 2009]] at the [[Nintendo]] conference.&lt;ref name="C.O.P: The Recruit Announced"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ahearn | first=Nate | date=June 2, 2009 | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/02/e3-2009-cop-the-recruit-announced | title=E3 2009: C.O.P.: The Recruit Announced | publisher=[[IGN]] 
| accessdate=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was originally registered under numerous names, one of which being ''Driver: The Recruit''.&lt;ref name="Driver: The Recruit Registered"&gt;{{cite web | last=Feeney | first=Richard | date=June 2, 2009 | url=http://www.onelastcontinue.com/7966/e3-2009-cop-the-recruit-drivers-little-brother | title=E3 2009: C.O.P.

==Plot==
The game follows Dan Miles, a former street racer who becomes a new recruit in the Criminal Overturn Program (C.O.P.). Under the terms of the C.O.P., Dan becomes a detective working to protect the citizens of [[New York City]] against large-scale threats. Working with his mentor, Detective Brad Winter, Dan is investigating a series of terrorist attacks in the city when Brad is falsely arrested, putting the investigation on hold. While trying to uncover the truth behind Brad's arrest, Dan goes undercover and returns to his life on the streets. Little by little he gets wrapped up in a deadly, widespread conspiracy and must work to prevent a potentially catastrophic attack on the city.&lt;ref name="E3 2009 C.O.P: The Recruit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/games/cop-the-recruit/nds-14344025 | title=C.O.P.: The Recruit - Nintendo DS | publisher=IGN | accessdate=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game is a third person shooter and a driving game, in a New York City with the same map layout and environment as ''[[Driver: Parallel Lines]]'' (confirming its relation with the [[Driver (series)|Driver series]]), however due to memory constraints lacking the island of [[Bronx]]. Also it has most of the sound effects from Driver: Parallel Lines recycled in game along with most of the cars. The game has around 51 missions with over 20 hours of gameplay. It's also possible, using the DS system's microphone (and the in-game PDA), to call the S.W.A.T. team, create barricades, road blocks, call an ambulance and access the city's camera system.&lt;ref name="E3 2009 C.O.P: The Recruit" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7428">The '''Camargo Society''' was a London society which created and produced ballet between 1930 and 1933, giving opportunity to British musicians, choreographers, designers and dancers.&lt;ref name="LEEPER1945"&gt; Janet Leeper (1945). ''English Ballet'', King Penguin  &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}  Its influence was disproportionate to its short life.  [[Dame Ninette de Valois]], founder of [[The Royal Ballet]], saw it as "having done much for the cause of English ballet",&lt;ref&gt; Ninette de Valois (1937). ''Invitation to the ballet'', The Bodley Head&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}} and [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] credits it with "keeping ballet alive in England during the early 1930s".&lt;ref&gt;http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90469/Camargo-Society&lt;/ref&gt; The society was named after the eighteenth-century French dancer [[Marie Anne de Cupis de Camargo]].&lt;ref name="Zimring2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zimring|first=Rishona|title=Social Dance and the Modernist Imagination in Interwar Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sba145B2WXUC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1-4094-5576-9|page=125|chapter=How Bloomsbury Danced}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The scene in 1930==
[[Ballets Russes]] had held a London season most years but when [[Sergei Diaghilev]] died in 1929 the company collapsed, heavily in debt.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Haskell (1935). ''Diaghileff'', Gollancz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lifar (1940). ''Diaghilev'', Putnam&lt;/ref&gt;  Its successor company had not yet been formed.  Pavlova's company had given its last London season ever, as it was to die with Pavlova herself in January 1931.  Marie Rambert only started the small scale [[Ballet Club]] (later Ballet Rambert) in the autumn of 1930 with its first performance in 1931,&lt;ref&gt; Lionel Bradley (1946). ''Sixteen Years of Ballet Rambert'', Hinrichsen Edition Ltd &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} and [[Ninette de Valois]] was to found the [[Vic-Wells]] (later the Royal Ballet) in 1931 with 6 salaried dancers. &lt;ref name=And&gt; Zoe Anderson (2006). ''The Royal Ballet - 75 years'', Faber and Faber 
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}  [[International Ballet]] and the [[Festival Ballet]] were years away.  Britain's best known dancers [[Alicia Markova]] and [[Anton Dolin]] had been in England since the collapse of Ballets Russes but had no large scale company to dance for.  In 1930 serious professional ballet in London was at a low point and in the rest of the country was non-existent.  

==Formation==
The Camargo Society was conceived by [[Arnold Haskell]] (ballet critic and prolific author) and Philip Richardson (editor of ''Dancing Times''), and named after the 18th century ballerina [[Marie Camargo]] who first shortened her skirts and wore dancing slippers without heels.  Its aim was "to perpetuate the principles on which Diaghilev had run the Ballets Russes, as a fusion of dance, music and decor",&lt;ref name=Kav/&gt;{{rp|134}} encouraging British talent to create ballet on a scale that could not be attempted by the Ballet Club or the fledgling Vic-Wells.  The society intended to put on several Sunday evening and Monday afternoon performances each season at a West End theatre, commissioning the choreography and decor for each ballet and hiring an orchestra for each performance.&lt;ref name=And/&gt;{{rp|20}}  The necessary funds would be provided by a subscription audience. The committee included the young composer [[Constant Lambert]] as resident conductor, the semi-retired ballerina [[Lydia Lopokova]] as choreographic advisor and her husband the eminent economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] as treasurer.&lt;ref name=Kav/&gt;{{rp|114}}  Haskell himself described the society as “a management without a company”. &lt;ref name=And/&gt;{{rp|20}}  

==Productions==
The society's first performance, at the Cambridge Theatre in October 1930, was a mixed programme of one-act ballets.  The one received best was ''Pomona'' by the rising choreographer [[Frederick Ashton]],&lt;ref name=Kav&gt; Julie Kavanagh (1996). ''Secret Muses: the life of Frederick Ashton''. Faber and Faber &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} in which Anton Dolin partnered the American ballerina Anna Ludmila in the lead roles. Ashton also created pieces for the December performance at the Arts Theatre Club; ''Job, A Masque of Poetry and Music'', of which the critics did not know what to make,&lt;ref name="LEEPER1945"/&gt;{{rp|21}} and a series of tableaux illustrating Shakespeare's narrative poem ''A Lover's Complaint'' in which Lopokova herself took a part.&lt;ref name=Kav/&gt;{{rp|121}} In total the Camargo Society produced 16 new one-act ballets.&lt;ref name="LEEPER1945"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

''[[Façade (ballet)|Façade]]'', also by Ashton to [[William Walton]]'s existing score of the same name, is the one that lived longest and is still remembered today.&lt;ref name="LEEPER1945"/&gt;{{rp|19}} It later went into the repertoires of both the Ballet Club and the Vic-Wells, but the Vic-Wells lost their ''Façade'' sets and costumes when they fled Holland in May 1940 hours ahead of the German occupation.&lt;ref name=And/&gt;{{rp|72}} 

After several more modest ventures the society hired the Savoy Theatre in 1932 for an ambitious four week summer season, in which [[Olga Spessivtseva]] danced the lead parts in shortened versions of ''[[Giselle]]'' and ''[[Swan Lake]]''. &lt;ref name=And&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} This enterprise put the society seriously in debt. Its debts were cleared with two gala performances of ''[[Coppélia]]'' at the Royal Opera House in June 1933 when the major stars Markova, Dolin and Lopokova danced to full houses, including the then Queen, members of the government and a visiting international conference of economists. &lt;ref name=And/&gt;{{rp|21}}

==The end of the society==
This however was the society's last venture.  Ninette de Valois' company was now firmly established and tackling larger productions than the Ballet Club could, and to the Vic-Wells the society bequeathed all its sets and productions except ''Façade''. &lt;ref name=And/&gt;{{rp|21}} [[Constant Lambert]] went to the Vic-Wells as musical director and stayed until he died in 1951.  [[Frederick Ashton]] went as resident choreographer and stayed to become Director when de Valois retired, as well as a choreographer of world repute.  [[Alicia Markova]] and [[Anton Dolin]] went there as principal dancers.  They only stayed 2 years, but by the time they moved on to form their own company [[Robert Helpmann]] and [[Harold Turner (dancer)|Harold Turner]] and the 16-year-old [[Margot Fonteyn]] were able to take on their roles.&lt;ref&gt; P.W.Manchester (1947). ''Vic-Wells: a Ballet Progress'', Gollancz &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27-29}}  The Vic-Wells would perhaps have grown to the stature of the Royal Ballet without the Camargo Society, but there is no doubt that the Camargo Society helped the Vic Wells considerably in its formative phase.&lt;ref name="LEEPER1945"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

The ''Brotherhood of Centurions'' is a [[Club (organization)|club]] for which [[Racewalking|racewalkers]] are eligible who have completed a distance of 100 [[mile|international miles]] (160.9&amp;nbsp;km) in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] within 24 hours.  Its name derives from a popular title from those competitors achieving the feat in the 19th century British long-distance walking sport, called [[Pedestrianism]].

Pedestrianism was to be a popular spectator sport during the 18th and 19th centuries, as [[equestrianism]] still is, and [[bicycle racing]] became afterwards. Among the most famous professional pedestrians of that time was [[Robert Barclay Allardice]], who completed one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) in each of 1000 sequential hours.

In 1911, the Centurion title was set up as an award for amateur racewalkers. The first number was awarded to James Edwin Fowler-Dixon for a performance in [[London]] in 1877, and who was also elected the first president. Each successful Centurion earns the next number in sequence. That number belonging to the recipient in perpetuity. Since 1902, 100 mile (160.9 km) racewalks have been performed on a regular basis, with 94 held as of 2017. Centurion qualifying races are held annually in the [[United Kingdom]], including the [[Isle of Man]]. In addition to the British Centurions, Centurion clubs with their own qualifying races exist in [[the Netherlands]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. The club in [[Malaysia]] is currently inactive. Each club worldwide holds the same high standard. Members must walk a distance of 100 miles (160.9 km) within 24 hours. 

The most successful competitor in Centurion is [[Sandra Brown (ultradistance athlete)|Sandra Brown]] with 25 wins of the category for ladies. Some Centurions known primarily for their achievements in other distances are [[Brian_Adams_(race_walker)|Brian Adams]], [[Bill_Brown_(racewalker)|William Brown]], [[John_Kelly_(racewalker)|John Kelly]], [[Daniel_King_(racewalker)|Daniel]] and [[Dominic_King_(racewalker)|Dominic King]], [[Yiannis Kouros]], [[Shaul Ladany]], [[Frank O'Reilly]], [[Ian_Richards_(racewalker)|Ian Richards]], [[Don_Thompson_(racewalker)|Don Thompson]], and [[Rex Whitlock]].

'''Dance in Rotuma''' refers to the traditional and modern dance styles performed by the people of the island of [[Rotuma]], which became a dependency of [[Fiji]] in 1881. Despite Rotuma's political and historical links with [[Fiji]], the island's culture shows strong [[Polynesia]]n influences, particularly from [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]], which, along with Fiji, feature strongly in the history and traditions of the [[Rotumans|Rotuman people]].

Situated approximately {{Convert|465|km|abbr=on}} north of Fiji, Rotuma's relatively remote position ensures that the island still maintains major linguistic, historical, and cultural distinctions from its neighbours. However, the main styles of Rotuman dance, the [[Tautoga]], the [[Mak Sa'moa]] and the [[Mak Rarotoga]], show clearer influence from neighbouring cultures than most facets of the culture.

'''''Deus''''' is a [[1996 in video gaming|1996]] survival [[simulation game]] developed by [[Silmarils (company)|Silmarils]] and published by [[ReadySoft]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Robinson's Requiem]]''.

==Story==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
The player again assumes the role of ''Robinson's Requiem'' protagonist Officer Trepliev, who has become a bounty hunter for the Alien World Exploration department&lt;ref name=pcgamerus&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991115221047/http://www.pcgamer.com/reviews/342.html | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/reviews/342.html | title=''Deus'' | last=Wolf | first=Scott | date=April 1997 | work=[[PC Gamer US]] | archivedate=November 15, 1999 | accessdate=October 14, 2010 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has to save a scientific research station from a group of terrorists called the New Crusaders.&lt;ref name=pcgamerus /&gt;&lt;ref name=cgw&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816005148/http://www.gamespot.com/action/deus/review_cgw.html | url=http://www.gamespot.com/action/deus/review_cgw.html | title=Tedious Survival | last=Nguyen | first=Thierry | date=June 1, 1997 | work=[[Computer Gaming World]] | archivedate=August 16, 2000 | accessdate=October 14, 2010 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Like ''Robinson's Requiem'', the game features complex health monitoring and surgery systems; however, the game now contains an optional "action mode", which removes these systems.

== Release ==
Prior to its release on DOS and Windows, the game was originally in development for the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] under the working title ''Deus Ex Machina'' and was planned to be published around the fourth quarter of 1995, however, this early version was never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/CD%20Consoles/cdconsoles_numero05/Page%20077.jpg|title=Dossier - Ils Arrivent Sur Jaguar - Deus/Jaguar CD|magazine=CD Consoles|issue=5|publisher=Pressimage|date=March 1995|page=77|lang=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/jeo/archive.htm|title=Atari Explorer Online - Volume 4, Issue 4|website=atarihq.com|date=March 28, 1995|accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/ST%20Magazine/stmagazine_numero093/st%20magazine%20-%20N93%20-%20avril%201995%20-%20page058%20et%20059.jpg|title=Cahier loisirs / Avant première - Exclusif: Silmarils Et Le Jaguar|magazine=[[:fr:ST Magazine|ST Magazine]]|issue=93|publisher=Pressimage|date=April 1995|page=59|lang=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MANIAC.N020.1995.06/MANIAC.N020.1995.06-DURiAN_Searchable#page/n39/mode/1up|title=Feature - XT Generation Report - Atari Jaguar|magazine=[[:de:M!

==Reception==
''Deus''{{'}} critical reception was mixed. ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' found the realism of the simulation mode to be overwhelming, and described the game's action mode as "dull".&lt;ref name=cgw /&gt; ''[[PC Gamer US]]''{{'}}s Scott Wolf said that the game's "[i]rritations [...] outweigh any enjoyment you might find".&lt;ref name=pcgamerus /&gt; ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' offered a dissenting opinion; despite calling the initial learning curve "alpine", the reviewer wrote, "After a while [...] Deus suddenly starts being fun. You begin to get the hang of the interface, and start to get into the plot".&lt;ref name=pcgameruk&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020316021556/http://www.pcgamer.co.uk/games/gamefile_review_page.asp?item_id=321 | url=http://www.pcgamer.co.uk/games/gamefile_review_page.asp?item_id=321 | title=''Deus'' | work=[[PC Gamer UK]] | archivedate=March 16, 2002 | accessdate=October 14, 2010 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dyrehavsbakken''' ("The Animal Park's Hill"), commonly referred to as '''Bakken''' ("The Hill"), is an [[amusement park]] near [[Klampenborg]] ([[Gentofte|Gentofte municipality]]), but which belongs under [[Lyngby-Taarbæk Kommune]], [[Denmark]], about 10&amp;nbsp;km north of central [[Copenhagen]].
It opened in 1583&lt;ref name=bakken&gt;{{cite web | title= The history of Bakken | url= http://www.bakken.dk/english/bakken-the-worlds-oldest-amusement-park| work= | publisher= | date=2015-03-08 | accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the world's oldest operating amusement park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Oldest amusement park in operation| url= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-amusement-park-in-operation/ | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 2.5-2.7 million visitors per year, it is the second most popular attraction in Denmark, after the more widely known [[Tivoli Gardens]] amusement park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Top 25 Attractions in Denmark| url= http://www.visitdenmark.com/usa/en-us/menu/turist/turistinformation/attraktioner/top25attraktioner.htm| work= | publisher= | date= 2009-02-25| accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dyrehavsbakken, c. 1825.jpg|thumb|200px|Dyrehavsbakken in c. 1825]]
[[File:Dyrehavsbakken 1849.jpg|thumb|200px|Dyrehavsbakken in 1840]]
[[Image:Dyrehavsbakken i 1800-tallet.png|right|thumb|200px|Dyrehavsbakken in the 19th century]]
The origins of Dyrehavsbakken can be traced back to 1583 when Kirsten Piil discovered a natural spring in what is now known as [[Jægersborg Dyrehave]] or Dyrehaven, a large forest park north of [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name=bakken /&gt; Residents of Copenhagen were attracted to the spring water due to the poor water quality in central Copenhagen during this period. Many believed the natural spring to have curative properties, and therefore Piil's discovery drew large crowds, especially in the springtime.&lt;ref name=bakken /&gt; These large crowds attracted entertainers and hawkers, whose presence are the origins of the [[amusement parks|amusement park]] today.

For a period the area that the spring was located on, was not open to the public due to it being on royal hunting grounds.&lt;ref name=bakken /&gt; In 1669, [[Frederick III of Denmark|King Frederick III]] decided to set up an animal park in the area and his son, [[Christian V]], extended the size of the park by 3-4 times after he became king in 1670. The area was named [[Jægersborg Dyrehave]], its present name, in 1671. The park was off-limits to the general public under Christian V and this did not change until 1756, under [[Frederick V of Denmark|Frederick V]].

Open to the general public once again, Dyrehavsbakken began to flourish. The entertainers, hawkers, and innkeepers returned to the area, and Bakken's growing reputation throughout Europe attracted other entertainers and artists, including [[Pierrot|Pjerrot]], the clown who still is a fixture at the park today.&lt;ref name=bakken /&gt; Bakken continued to grow even throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Its popularity was later aided by easier accessibility due to the development of steamships (1820) and railroads (1864), as well as good publicity from poets and authors.&lt;ref name=bakken /&gt;

As the popularity of Bakken grew, its conditions worsened. As a result, some of the business owners, or "tent owners" as they are still called today, created the Dyrehavsbakken Tent Owners’ Association of 1885.&lt;ref name=bakken /&gt; The association improved garbage collection, restroom facilities, water supply, publicity, and helped bring electricity to the park. The association is still around today, and all businesses operating in the park are required to join.

The entertainment options also improved over time. [[Cabarets]] such as Sansouci, which opened in 1866, and Bakkens Hvile, which opened in 1877, became increasingly popular.&lt;ref name=bakken /&gt; The 20th century brought other popular ventures, such as the Circus Revue and automated moving rides.&lt;ref name=bakken /&gt; Over time, more modern rides and entertainment options have been introduced.

==Rides==
[[Image:Rutschebanen roller coaster.jpg|right|thumb|216px|Rutschebanen roller coaster]]
Bakken may have started as a place to get clean spring water, but today it is a thriving amusement park filled with modern rides and amenities. Bakken is home to six [[roller coasters]], the most famous of which is ''Rutschebanen'' (Danish for "The Roller Coaster"), a [[wooden roller coaster]] open since 1932. ''Rutschebanen'' has been deemed an [[American Coaster Enthusiasts]] Coaster Classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= ACE Coaster Classic  Awards| url= http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/?type=1| work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is also home to dozens of other [[amusement rides|amusements]] and smaller rides suited for all ages.

Several forms of gambling are legal in the U.S. state of [[Massachusetts]].

==Horse and dog racing==
[[Parimutuel wagering]] on horse racing is allowed at the state's two active racetracks, [[Plainridge Racecourse]] and [[Suffolk Downs]]. [[Off-track betting|Simulcast wagering]] on horse and dog races is also offered at [[Raynham Park]], which previously operated as a dog racing track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Horse wagering may be allowed to continue at Suffolk Downs via broadcast after live racing ends|newspaper=The Republican|location=Springfield, MA|author=Michael Norton|date=December 31, 2014|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/boston/index.ssf/2014/12/horse_wagering_may_be_allowed.html|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betting on horse and dog racing was legalized in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acts and Resolves passed by the General Court|publisher=Massachusetts General Court|date=1934|chapter=Chapter 374: An act authorizing the licensing of horse and dog races on which the pari-mutuel system of betting shall be permitted|url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1934/1934acts0374.pdf|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the major tracks, wagering was also conducted on horse and dog races at [[agricultural fair]]s around the state, including the [[Northampton Fair (race track)|Northampton Fair]], [[Marshfield Fair]], [[Great Barrington Fair]], [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]] Fair, Berkshire County Fair (at [[Berkshire Downs (racetrack)|Berkshire Downs]]), [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]] Fair, and [[Topsfield, Massachusetts|Topsfield]] Fair.&lt;ref name=finley&gt;{{cite news|title=Thanks for the memories|newspaper=ESPN Horse Racing|author=Bill Finley|date=December 21, 2005|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/horse/columns/story?id=2267707|accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racing is big business at Massachusetts fairs|newspaper=Billboard|date=December 20, 1952|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;ots=99itwcT4s5&amp;pg=PA54|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Match fixing|Race fixing]] was notoriously common at these meets.&lt;ref name=finley /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My $50,000 Year at the Races|author=Andrew Beyer|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=1980|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jXCQlsfmn4C&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;ots=3bP7l060fQ&amp;pg=PA107|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fair circuit came to an end when the last remaining venue, Northampton, held its final racing meet in 2005.&lt;ref name=finley /&gt;

==Casinos==
{{main|List of casinos in Massachusetts}}
===Indian casinos===
Both of the state's [[federally recognized tribes]] have worked for several years to open gaming facilities on tribal lands, under the federal [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]]. The [[Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe]] hopes to open a casino on land in [[Taunton]]. The [[Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah)]] plans a small gaming facility in [[Aquinnah, Massachusetts|Aquinnah]], on [[Martha's Vineyard]].

The Mashpee tribe gained federal recognition in 2007. Their casino, referred to as Project First Light, would be located in what is currently an industrial park, which they have applied to the federal government to take into trust, making it sovereign tribal land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mashpee tribe waits on federal decision|newspaper=Boston Globe|author=Philip Marcelo|agency=AP|date=December 24, 2014|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/12/24/mashpee-tribe-hoping-for-reservation-build-casino/39pzmhEx9eQthH7qr5AafP/story.html|accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aquinnah tribe announced plans in 2013 for their [[Class II gaming|Class II]] gaming facility in an unfinished community center on their reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribe claims approval for Martha’s Vineyard casino, reviving fight|newspaper=New York Times|author=Katharine Q.

The tribe argues that this agreement was superseded by the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State files lawsuit to block Martha's Vineyard casino|newspaper=Boston Globe|author=Mark Arsenault|date=December 2, 2013|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/02/state-files-suit-block-martha-vineyard-casino/8W88DeMuoK5EB90iTsv6FK/story.html|accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Expanded Gaming Act, passed in 2011, as many as three casino resorts and one slot parlor can be opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expanded Gaming Act|publisher=Massachusetts Gaming Commission|url=http://massgaming.com/about/expanded-gaming-act/|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slot parlor opened at [[Plainridge Park Casino]] in June 2015, and a casino resort, [[MGM Springfield]], opened in 2018. Another casino resort, [[Encore Boston Harbor]], is under development as of 2018 and scheduled to open in 2019. One more casino license may be issued for the southeastern part of the state, but the process has been delayed due to uncertainty about potential competition from the planned Mashpee Wampanoag casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mass.

Born '''Edward George Wright''', Lashwood was known as "the [[Beau Brummell]] of the music halls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Clark |url=http://www.musichallcds.co.uk/cdr10_page.htm |title=George Lashwood - What a Don! |publisher=Musichallcds.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lashwood was born in [[Birmingham]], England, the son of a local builder. He made his first provincial appearance in 1883 and his London début at The Middlesex Music Hall in [[Drury Lane]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O85122/caricature-cooke-george/ |title=Caricature &amp;#124; Cooke, George |publisher=Collections.vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He performed at the Plaza Music Hall in New York in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A12F63D5412738DDDAE0894DA415B898CF1D3 |title=George Lashwood Appears. - English Singer Interrupts His Lyrics with a Patter to Audience |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Lashwood's songs became among the earliest hits of the [[phonograph|gramophone]] era and included such numbers as "Riding on Top of the Car", "Send for a Policeman", "[[Goodbye, Dolly Gray]]" and "Oh! Blow The Scenery on the Railway".  He was also noted for singing numerous patriotic songs during [[World War I]], which became popular with troops and the population at home.

Lashwood married twice.  His first wife was Charlotte Williams.  His second wife, Edith Fink, was an actress, singer and comedienne.

He died on 20 January 1942 at [[Droitwich Spa]] in [[Worcestershire]], and is buried in the churchyard of St Mary de Wyche, [[Wychbold]], Worcestershire.&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt;

SEE FOOTNOTE--&gt; [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].{{ref|1|1}} It is the sequel to 2008's ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' and 2010's ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the seventh film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Shane Black]] from a screenplay he co-wrote with [[Drew Pearce]], and stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]], alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Guy Pearce]], [[Rebecca Hall]], [[Stéphanie Szostak]], [[James Badge Dale]], [[Jon Favreau]], and [[Ben Kingsley]]. In ''Iron Man 3'', Tony Stark deals with the stress and trauma caused by the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', while investigating a string of terrorist attacks led by the mysterious [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], and comes into a conflict with an old enemy: [[Aldrich Killian]].

After the release of ''Iron Man 2'' in May 2010, Favreau, who served as director, decided not to return, and in February 2011 Black was hired to write and direct the film. Black and Pearce opted to make the script more character-centric and focused on thriller elements, which also uses concepts from the "[[Extremis]]" story arc by [[Warren Ellis]]. Throughout April and May 2012, the film's supporting cast was filled out, with Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall brought in to portray key roles. Filming began on May 23, and lasted through December 17, 2012, primarily at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. Additional shooting took place at various locations around [[North Carolina]], as well as [[Florida]], [[China]], and [[Los Angeles]]. The visual effects were handled by 17 companies, including [[Scanline VFX]], [[Digital Domain]], and [[Weta Digital]]. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.

''Iron Man 3'' premiered at the [[Grand Rex]] in Paris on April 14, 2013, and released in the United States on May 3. The film received praise for its performances, visual effects, action sequences, humor, story, and [[Brian Tyler]]'s musical score, while reception to its plot twist was mixed. It was a huge box office success, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the [[2013 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 2013]] overall, and the second-highest-grossing film released in 2013 in the United States and Canada. It became the sixteenth film to gross over $1 billion and the [[List of highest-grossing films|&lt;!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!--&gt;fifth&lt;!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!--&gt;-highest-grossing film of all time]], with its opening weekend ranking as the [[List of highest-grossing openings for films|sixth-highest-grossing opening of all time]]. The film received a nomination for the [[Academy Award]] in the category of Best Visual Effects, and received another nomination for the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] in the same category.

==Plot==
&lt;!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 to 700 words ONLY.--&gt;
At a [[New Year's Eve]] party in 1999, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] meets scientist [[Maya Hansen]], the inventor of experimental regenerative treatment [[Extremis]] that allows recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist [[Aldrich Killian]] offers them a place in his company [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]], but Stark rejects him. In 2013,&lt;!-- Confirmed in the film from various characters and a newspaper that reads December 23, 2013 --&gt; Stark is having panic attacks due to his experiences during the alien invasion and subsequent Battle of New York.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2012 film ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="CapTWSSynopsis1" /&gt;}} Restless, he has built dozens of [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|Iron Man suits]], creating friction with his girlfriend [[Pepper Potts]].

A string of bombings by a terrorist known as the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] is badly injured in a Mandarin attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with gunship helicopters. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his [[artificial intelligence]] [[Edwin Jarvis|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.

Teaming with Harley, a precocious 10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents [[Ellen Brandt|Brandt]] and [[Coldblood|Savin]] attack him. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts and Hansen. American intelligence agencies continue to search for the Mandarin's location, with [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]—the former War Machine, now re-branded as the [[Iron Patriot]]—lured into a trap to steal his Iron Man-like armor.

With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to [[Miami]] and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named [[Trevor Slattery]], who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. Killian kills Hansen when she tries to stop him.

Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]], using Rhodes armor. Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's&lt;!--credited as "Vice President's daughter"--&gt; disability. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the president and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.

Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to leave his life as Iron Man behind, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.

==Cast==
&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE CAST ORDER WITHOUT DISCUSSING FIRST ON TALK PAGE! --&gt;
* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: {{Cast list break|A self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with [[Iron Man's armor|mechanical suits of armor]] of his own invention. Stark now struggles to come to terms with his near-death experience in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'',&lt;ref name="PrincipalPhotog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IM3Characters"/&gt; suffering from anxiety attacks. On making a third ''Iron Man'' film, Downey said, "My sense of it is that we need to leave it all on the field—whatever that means in the end. You can pick several different points of departure for that."&lt;ref name="DowneyAug2011" /&gt; On following up ''The Avengers'', Downey said they "tried to be practical, in a post-''Avengers'' world. What are his challenges now?  What are some limitations that might be placed on him?  And what sort of threat would have him, as usual, ignore those limitations?"&lt;ref name="ComicCon12Interview" /&gt; Screenwriter Drew Pearce compared Tony to an American [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] for both being "heroes with a sense of danger to them, and unpredictability" even if Stark was a "free agent" instead of an authority figure like Bond. He also likened Tony to the protagonists of 1970s films such as ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', where "the idiosyncrasies of the heroes is what made them exciting."&lt;ref name=wc/&gt;}}
* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as [[Pepper Potts|Virginia "Pepper" Potts]]: {{Cast list break|Stark's girlfriend, longtime associate, and the current CEO of [[Stark Industries]].&lt;ref name="PrincipalPhotog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feige" /&gt; Paltrow says of her character's relationship to Tony, "[She still] adores Tony, but she absolutely gets fed up with him. He gets caught in a feedback loop."&lt;ref name="ScreenRant"/&gt; Kevin Feige commented on Pepper's role in the film: "The love triangle in this movie is really between Tony, Pepper and the suits. Tony, Pepper and his obsession with those suits, and the obsession with technology." Feige also stated that the film uses the character to play with the [[damsel in distress]] trope, and posits the question, "Is Pepper in danger or is Pepper the savior?"&lt;ref name="About.com" /&gt;}}
* [[Don Cheadle]] as [[War Machine|James "Rhodey" Rhodes]] / [[Iron Patriot]]: {{Cast list break|Stark's best friend, the liaison between Stark Industries and the U.S. Air Force in the department of acquisitions. Rhodes operates the redesigned/upgraded [[War Machine]] armor, taking on an [[American flag]]-inspired color scheme similar to the [[Iron Patriot]] armor from the comics.&lt;ref name="IM3Characters" /&gt; Feige said of Rhodes and the armor, "The notion in the movie is that a red, white and blue suit is a bold statement, and it's meant to be. With Rhodey, he's very much the foil to Tony's eccentricities, and in this one you get to see this and be reminded of the trust and friendship between them in that great [[Shane Black]] [[Buddy cop film|buddy-cop]] fashion."&lt;ref name="Collider" /&gt; In the film, the president asks Rhodey to take up the moniker "Iron Patriot," and don the red, white, and blue suit, in order to be the government's "American hero" in response to the events in ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="IronPatriot3"/&gt;}}
* [[Guy Pearce]] as [[Aldrich Killian]]: {{Cast list break|The creator of the [[Extremis]] virus&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt; and the founder and owner of the science and development organisation [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]],&lt;ref name="Pearce3" /&gt; who adopts the mantle of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] as his own.&lt;ref name="EWPage3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PearceTotalFilm" /&gt; Killian develops Extremis to cure his own debilitating disability; in addition to his regenerative healing qualities, he has superhuman strength and the ability to generate extreme heat. Prolonged exposure to Extremis also grants him the ability to breathe fire. On taking the role, Pearce said, "I feel a little more experimental in what I'll take on these days, but I still don't know that I would want to play the superhero myself, since I'm playing a different kind of character in this film ... The main difference was that, when I did ''[[The Time Machine (2002 film)|The Time Machine]]'', I was pretty much in all of it, so it was a really grueling experience. ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' and ''Iron Man'' are really kind of cameo stuff, so the experience of shooting them ... I mean, on some level, it's tricky because you feel like a bit of an outsider. You don't really live the experience that you do when you're there all day every day with everybody. But at the same time, it can be more fun sometimes because you're just working in concentrated spurts."&lt;ref name="Pearce2" /&gt; Pearce described his character as a man "who came into this world with a number of physical disabilities. He's never been able to accept those limitations though and has spent most of his life trying to overcome them in any way he can. His tenacity and blind determination in fighting for a better life are seen by some as irritating, as he often comes across as obnoxious. He just won't accept the cards he was dealt, and being as intelligent as he is, has real drive to change and become a different person."&lt;ref name="Pearce3" /&gt; Shane Black specified, "Ultimately we do give you the Mandarin, the real guy, but it's Guy Pearce in the end with the big dragon tattooed on his chest."&lt;ref name="EWPage3" /&gt; He elaborated, "Do they hand me a blank check and say, 'Go break something!'

If you look, there's not necessarily a definitive Mandarin storyline in the comics. So it was really about having an idea."&lt;ref name="Collider" /&gt; Shane Black explains that Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is not Chinese in the film as he is in the comics in order to avoid the [[Fu Manchu]] stereotype: "We're not saying he's Chinese, we're saying he, in fact, draws a cloak around him of Chinese symbols and dragons because it represents his obsessions with [[Sun Tzu]] in various ancient arts of warfare that he studied."  The filmmakers also cited [[Colonel Kurtz]] from ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' as an influence for the character.&lt;ref name="Yahoo" /&gt; The videos where the Mandarin gives historical background to the attacks expressed how it emerged as the product of "a [[think tank]] of people trying to create a modern terrorist."&lt;ref name=comm/&gt; Thus the Mandarin "represents every terrorist in a way," from South American [[guerrilla warfare|insurgency tactics]] to the [[Videos and audio recordings of Osama bin Laden|videos of]] [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo" /&gt;}}

{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=Truthfully, the way to go about doing a part 3, if you're ever in that position, as I'm lucky enough to be, is to find a way that the first two weren't done yet. You have to find a way to make sure that the story that's emerging is still ongoing and, by the time you've finished 3, will be something resembling the culmination of a trilogy. It's about, 'How has the story not yet been completely told?,' and I think we're getting there. I think we've really found ways to make this feel organic and new, based on what's come before, and that's what I'm happy about.|source=—[[Shane Black]], director of ''Iron Man 3'', on the film.&lt;ref name="ComicCon12Interview" /&gt;}}

Following the release of ''Iron Man 2'', a conflict between [[Paramount Pictures]], which had distribution rights to certain Marvel properties, and [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[Marvel Entertainment]]'s then new corporate parent, clouded the timing and the distribution arrangement of a possible third film.&lt;ref name="DistribDispute" /&gt; On October 18, 2010, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] agreed to pay Paramount at least $115&amp;nbsp;million for the worldwide distribution rights to ''Iron Man 3'',&lt;ref name="DistribDisney" /&gt; with Disney, Marvel, and Paramount announcing a May 3, 2013 release date for the film.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDate" /&gt;

''Iron Man'' and ''Iron Man 2'' director [[Jon Favreau]] said in December 2010 that he would not direct ''Iron Man 3'', opting to direct ''[[Magic Kingdom (film)|Magic Kingdom]]'' instead. He remained an executive producer of director [[Joss Whedon]]'s crossover film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and also served as an executive producer of ''Iron Man 3''.&lt;ref name="FavreauProducer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FavreauNotDirecting" /&gt; Also in 2010, Downey reached out to [[Shane Black]], who directed him in 2005's ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'', to write and direct the film.&lt;ref name="BlackTHRMar2016" /&gt; In February 2011, Black entered final negotiations to join the project,&lt;ref name="BlackDirecting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BlackWriting" /&gt; and in March it was announced that [[Drew Pearce]], who Marvel had originally hired for a ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' script, would work with Black on the script.&lt;ref name="DrewPearce" /&gt; Downey said, "Bringing in Shane Black to write and direct ''Iron Man 3'' to me is basically the only transition from Favreau to a 'next thing' that Favreau and the audience and Marvel and I could ever actually sign off on."&lt;ref name="DowneyAug2011" /&gt;

====Writing====
Shane Black described his take on the film as not being "two men in iron suits fighting each other," and more like a "[[Tom Clancy]] thriller," with Iron Man fighting real-world type villains.&lt;ref name="BlackWriting" /&gt; Drew Pearce added that they would avert magic and space, with ''Iron Man 3'' being "a techno-thriller set in a more real world than even ''The Avengers''." The duo spent some time discussing themes and images and ideas before starting the script.&lt;ref name=wc/&gt; While writing, the focus was to avoid scenes of pure [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]], making every moment propel other narrative points forwards. Some elements from the comics were used even if in different connotations, such as making Rhodes wear [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Iron Patriot]] armor, and naming some characters with names from unrelated people in the Marvel Universe, such as Eric Savin and Jack Taggart.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt;

The film's plot is influenced primarily from "Extremis," the 2005–2006 ''Iron Man'' comics storyline written by [[Warren Ellis]].&lt;ref name=FiOS/&gt; The first two acts would remain character-centric, albeit in Shane Black's words "more hectic, frenetic, and large scale" to fulfill its sequel obligations, with the third act going for more over-the-top action to what Drew Pearce described as "giving a sense of opera." The middle act was compared to ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' in having Tony meeting various people on his journey, and the writers made sure to not make the characters too similar. The initial draft had Maya Hansen herself leading the villainous operation, with the Mandarin and Killian emerging as antagonists in later versions of the script. During one of the writing sessions, Pearce suggested that the Mandarin was a fake, and Black agreed by going with making him an actor, which in turn Pearce detailed as an overacting British stage performer. Black explained: "Who would be fool enough to declare that is an international terrorist? If you're smart, whatever regime you're part of, you'd put a [[Puppet state|puppet committee]] and remain your house." In turn Killian would hide Slattery in "his own [[frat house]], in kind of a drug-related [[house arrest]]" to keep the secret alive.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt;

According to Black, the reveal of the actual villain being Hansen was "like ''[[Remington Steele]]'', you think it's the man but at the end, the woman has been running the whole show." The role was eventually shifted to Killian because of objections by Marvel Entertainment executives, who were concerned with apparent merchandising losses that could come with having a female villain. The roles of several other major female characters were also made smaller in the final film compared to earlier drafts.&lt;ref name="BlackMay2016" /&gt;

Both the opening and the ending of the film were reworked in various ways. First it would begin with a flashback to Tony's childhood. Then like ''Iron Man'' it would begin [[in medias res]], with Tony crashing in Tennessee before a voiceover that would lead to how he got there, until it got changed to the final version. For the climactic tanker battle, it was originally considered that Brandt would show up in the ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' tradition of the henchman coming back for the heroes. Instead they chose to use Killian himself, and have Pepper, whom he abused earlier, cause his downfall as a way of poetic justice. The final dialogue was originally written as "I am Tony Stark" to be a response to the first film's ending, but eventually it changed to "I am Iron Man" to enhance the mythical qualities.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt; On setting the film around [[Christmas]], Black said "I think it's a sense of if you're doing something on an interesting scale that involves an entire universe of characters, one way to unite them is to have them all undergo a common experience. There's something at Christmas that unites everybody and it already sets a stage within the stage, that wherever you are, you're experiencing this world together. I think that also there's something just pleasing about it to me." Pearce added that he would have wanted to see a third ''Iron Man'' film set at Christmas, adding that "when you're telling a story about taking characters apart, it almost has more resonance if you put it at Christmas and if you're also telling a story about lonelier characters as well. That loneliness is heightened at Christmas." Black also felt the character Harley Keener embodied the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] for Stark.&lt;ref name="ChristmasSetting" /&gt;

===Pre-production===
In September 2011, Marvel Studios reached an agreement to shoot the film primarily out of [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. [[Michigan]] was also in contention to land the production, but the Michigan Film Office could not match [[North Carolina]]'s tax incentives.&lt;ref name="MichiganLosesOut" /&gt; In April 2012, [[Ben Kingsley]] entered into negotiations to play a villain in ''Iron Man 3''.&lt;ref name="Kingsley" /&gt; The following week, producer Kevin Feige revealed that ''Iron Man 3'' would begin shooting in North Carolina "in five weeks," and said that it "is a full-on Tony Stark-centric movie ... very much inspired by the first half of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' ... [H]e's stripped of everything, he's backed up against a wall, and he's gotta use his intelligence to get out of it. He can't call [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], he can't call [[Captain America|Cap]], he can't call [[Nick Fury]], and he can't look for the [[Helicarrier]] in the sky."&lt;ref name="FeigeApril2012" /&gt; A few days later, [[The Walt Disney Company|The Walt Disney Company China]], [[Marvel Studios]], and [[DMG Entertainment]] announced an agreement to co-produce ''Iron Man 3'' in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.&lt;ref name="DMGChina" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VarietyProduction"/&gt;

The next week, [[Guy Pearce]] entered into final talks to play [[Aldrich Killian]], a character who is featured in the "Extremis" comic book story arc.&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt; Chinese star [[Andy Lau]] became involved in negotiations to join the film, as a Chinese scientist and old friend of Stark's who comes to his aid.&lt;ref name="AndyLau" /&gt; Lau would later turn down the role, and [[Wang Xueqi]] was cast instead.&lt;ref name="LauTurnsDown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang1" /&gt; [[Jessica Chastain]] entered into discussions for a role in the film,&lt;ref name="Chastain" /&gt; but bowed out due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; In May, [[Rebecca Hall]] was cast in her place,&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; and her role was described as "a scientist who plays a pivotal role in the creation of a nanotechnology, known as Extremis."&lt;ref name="Hall2" /&gt; Over the next few weeks, [[James Badge Dale]] was cast as [[Coldblood|Eric Savin]],&lt;ref name="JamesBadgeDale" /&gt; [[Ashley Hamilton]] was cast as [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton" /&gt; and Favreau returned to reprise his role as [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] from the first two films.&lt;ref name="HappyHogan" /&gt; [[Stéphanie Szostak]] and [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] were also cast in the film, with Sadler playing the President of the United States.&lt;ref name="Sadler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szostak" /&gt; Despite erroneous early reports that [[Cobie Smulders]] would reprise her role as [[Maria Hill]] from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in the film,&lt;ref name="SmuldersYes"/&gt; Smulders wrote on her verified [[Twitter]] page that this was not so.&lt;ref name="SmuldersNo"/&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Port of Wilmington Aerial 3B19.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Port of Wilmington (North Carolina)|Port of Wilmington]] served as the location for the climactic oil tanker battle.]]
Filming began in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] on May 23, 2012 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios,&lt;ref name="CaryFilming2"/&gt; with the [[working title]] ''Caged Heat''.&lt;ref name="CagedHeat" /&gt; Cinematographer [[John Toll]] opted to for the first time in his career work with [[digital camera]]s, as he found them more convenient for a visual effects-heavy production. Toll shot the film primarily on the [[Arri Alexa]] camera.&lt;ref name="TollCodex" /&gt; From June 4 through June 6, 2012, filming took place in [[Cary, North Carolina]] at the [[Epic Games]] headquarters&lt;ref name="CaryFilming" /&gt; and [[SAS Institute]],&lt;ref name="WRALFilmingLocations" /&gt; with a large [[Christmas tree]] set up on the front lawn.&lt;ref name="CaryFilming3" /&gt; A scene was also shot at the [[Wilmington International Airport]].&lt;ref name="CaryFilming2" /&gt; The Port of Wilmington served as a location for the oil tanker in the climactic battle, along with a soundstage recreation of the dock.&lt;ref name="comm" /&gt; The crumbling house itself was filmed in a [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic-powered]] [[giubo]] platform that could bend and split into two pieces. All the interior footage had [[practical effects]], including debris and explosions, with computer graphics used only to add exteriors and Iron Man's armor.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unmasked" /&gt;

From July 19 to August 1, 2012, filming took place on [[Oak Island, North Carolina]], to "film aerial drops over the Atlantic Ocean."&lt;ref name="OakIslandFilming" /&gt; They were done for the scene where Iron Man rescues the people falling from the Air Force One over Miami, which were originally envisioned done with green screen effects, but were changed to using actual skydivers as second unit director Brian Smrz knew the [[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]] [[skydiving]] team. Computer graphics were only employed to add clouds, the destroyed plane and matte paintings of the Florida coastline in the background, replace a stand-in with the Iron Man armor, and some [[digital compositing]] to combine different takes of the skydivers together.&lt;ref name="deconstructingAF1" /&gt; Filming took place in [[Rose Hill, North Carolina]] in early August 2012,&lt;ref name="RoseHillFilming" /&gt; and the town's name was incorporated into the script as the [[Tennessee]] city Stark visits.&lt;ref name="unmasked" /&gt; On August 14, actress [[Dale Dickey]] said she had been cast in the film, and was currently shooting her scenes.&lt;ref name="DaleDickey" /&gt; The following day, production was halted when Downey suffered an ankle injury.&lt;ref name="RDJAnkleInjury" /&gt; During the break, Black and Pearce made more script revisions before shooting resumed by August 24.&lt;ref name="RDJAnkleInjury2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RDJAnkleInjury4" /&gt;

Cast and crew began arriving in [[Florida]] on October 1, to shoot scenes on [[Dania Beach, Florida|Dania Beach]] and around South Florida.&lt;ref name="DaniaFilming" /&gt; That same day, Downey returned to the set after his ankle injury.&lt;ref name="RDJAnkleInjury3" /&gt; In early October, scenes were shot at a replica of the Malibu restaurant [[Neptune's Net]],&lt;ref name="NeptunesNet" /&gt; and filming took place on location at the [[Vizcaya Museum and Gardens]].&lt;ref name="Vizcaya" /&gt; Scenes were shot during the daytime inside the Miami Beach Resort at [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] on October 10 and 11.&lt;ref name="MiamiBeach" /&gt; The production returned to Wilmington in mid-October for additional filming.&lt;ref name="WilmingtonReturn" /&gt; On November 1, scenes were shot at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens.&lt;ref name="NovemberWrap1" /&gt; Filming in the United States wrapped on November 7 in Wilmington.&lt;ref name="FilmingNC"/&gt;

Filming began in [[Beijing, China]] on December 10. Filming was scheduled to wrap a week later on December 17, 2012.&lt;ref name="Wang2" /&gt; The China filming did not include the main cast and crew.&lt;ref name="FilmingNC"/&gt; In January 2013, it was reported that a film crew led by Shane Black would begin location scouting in [[Hyderabad]] and [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[India]] between January 20 and 24.&lt;ref name="India"/&gt; Also in January, Cheadle confirmed that reshooting was taking place in [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]].&lt;ref name="Collider2" /&gt; Shooting also took place on the week of January 23, 2013 at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|TCL Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="VarietyChinese" /&gt; A major part of the content filmed in the reshoots regarded the Mandarin, with Drew Pearce saying that in early cuts, the character "didn't feel real enough—there wasn't a sense of him being [part of] the real world, mostly because he was just looking down a lens and threatening the world."&lt;ref name=wc/&gt; A report on actual production costs for films from FilmL.A. Inc., indicated a gross budget of $200 million, with a net of $178.4 million for ''Iron Man 3'' after tax incentives from North Carolina and Florida.&lt;ref name="FilmLA" /&gt;

===Post-production===
[[File:Iron Man 3 - MK 42.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Previsualization]] of the [[Iron Man's armor#Live action films|Mark 42 armor]] (top) and the completed shot (bottom)]]
Chris Townsend served as visual effects supervisor for the film, which featured over 2,000 visual effects shots and was worked on by 17 studios, including [[Weta Digital]], [[Digital Domain]], [[Scanline VFX]], Trixter, [[Framestore]], [[Luma Pictures]], Fuel VFX, Cantina Creative, [[Cinesite]], [[The Embassy Visual Effects]], Lola, Capital T, Prologue and Rise FX.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; Townsend said that from January 2013 through the end of filming in April, the collective crew had one day of downtime, otherwise working seven days a week and 14 to 18 hours a day.&lt;ref name="CGSociety"/&gt;

Digital Domain, Scanline VFX and Trixter each worked on separate shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared some of their files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, [[Legacy Effects]] constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that "Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put [[motion capture|tracking markers]] on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height—Iron Man is 6'5". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, [[Canon EOS C300|Canon C300s]], and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character." The artists studied time lapse photography of decaying fruit and vegetables and actual phenomena such as the [[Aurora|aurora borealis]] as reference for the effect of the glowing Extremis characters.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; The heads-up display features of the helmet were inspired by visualization techniques from MRI diagnostic pattern recognition and graph theory, particularly by the [[connectogram]], a circular graph that maps all of the white-matter connections of the human brain.&lt;ref name=IronMan&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://helenabarbas.net/papers/2017_VR_AR_MR_Simulation_IronMan_H_Barbas.pdf|title=VR, AR, MR Simulations and Inspirations from 'Iron Man 3'|first=Helen|last=Barbas|date=October 2017|conference=European Simulation and Modelling Conference|editor=Goncalves, Paulo J.S. |access-date=November 6, 2017|page=26|quote=According to the VRX creators (Cantina.co), the design work was inspired by medical MRI diagnostic pattern-recognition and graph theory ...| archivedate= December 13, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171213011305/http://helenabarbas.net/papers/2017_VR_AR_MR_Simulation_IronMan_H_Barbas.pdf|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's production was delayed following Downey's leg injury, and for certain shots they were forced to create a double for Downey. Townsend explained that "The collective VFX [supervisors] and unit leads ran into a room as soon as the incident happened to try to ascertain what sequences could they shoot." Certain shots were filmed with a body double on set, and Weta Digital created a digital body double for others.&lt;ref name="CGSociety"/&gt;

A total of three hours and 15 minutes of footage were shot before editing, where it was brought down to 130 minutes (119 without the credits),&lt;ref name=comm/&gt; marking the longest stand-alone ''Iron Man'' film.&lt;ref name=FiOS/&gt; Post-production also had a [[3D film|3D]] conversion&lt;ref name="PostPro3d"/&gt; and a digital remaster for the [[IMAX]] release.&lt;ref name="IMAX"/&gt; [[Todd-AO]] mixed the sound in [[Dolby Atmos]] to enhance the immersive experience.&lt;ref name="DolbyAtmos" /&gt;

==Music==
{{further|Iron Man 3 (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}
The film is scored by [[Brian Tyler]], who signed on in October 2012.&lt;ref name="TylerScoring" /&gt; According to Tyler, he was approached more for his "thematic" scores such as ''[[The Greatest Game Ever Played]]'', ''[[Annapolis (2006 film)|Annapolis]]'', and ''[[Partition (2007 film)|Partition]]'' rather than his "modern" action scores such as ''[[The Fast and the Furious (series)|The Fast and Furious]]'' films, with Kevin Feige asking a theme that was recognizable and featured those dramatic tones.&lt;ref name="TylerIM3Podcast" /&gt; To employ the "deeply thematic component with a strong melody," the score employs mostly orchestra sounds. The main theme for Iron Man focuses on horns and trumpets,&lt;ref name="score" /&gt; to be "both a march and anthem." Tyler mentioned that [[John Williams]]' work in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' was the first thing he thought of as an influence, and the cue for the Well of Souls in ''Raiders'' influenced the Extremis motif, as Tyler felt it should enhance an spiritual side for having a "technology so advanced that nears magic." Echoing the Mandarin's amalgamated personality, his theme was religious music "that borrows from many cultures," from "Monastic, Gothic, and Christian chants to music from the Middle-East."&lt;ref name="TylerIM3Podcast" /&gt; The score was recorded with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]].&lt;ref name="score" /&gt; Tyler is the third primary composer to score an ''Iron Man'' film, following [[Ramin Djawadi]] of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' and [[John Debney]] of ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.

Along with Tyler's [[Iron Man 3 (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]], [[Hollywood Records]] released a [[concept album]] inspired by the film, ''Heroes Fall''. It features twelve original [[alternative rock]] and [[indie rock]] songs, with only one appearing in the film itself, [[Awolnation]]'s "Some Kind of Joke."&lt;ref name="HeroesFall" /&gt;

==Marketing==
In July 2012, at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], a new [[Iron Man's armor (film)|Iron Man armor]] from the film, the Mark XLII, was on display on the convention floor, along with the Marks I-VII from the first two ''Iron Man'' films and ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="ComicConNewArmor" /&gt; A panel was held, during which Shane Black, Robert Downey Jr., Don Cheadle, Jon Favreau and Kevin Feige discussed making the film, and several minutes of footage from the film were shown.&lt;ref name="ComicConPanel" /&gt; The first television advertisement aired during [[Super Bowl XLVII]] on the [[CBS]] network in the United States.&lt;ref name="SuperBowl" /&gt; On March 25, 2013, Marvel and Disney revealed on the official ''Iron Man'' Facebook page, "Iron Man 3: Armor Unlock," to reveal suits Stark has made before the events of the film.&lt;ref name="ArmorReveal" /&gt; In January 2013, Marvel Comics released a two-issue comic book prelude by writers [[Christos Gage]] and Will Corona Pilgrim with art by Steve Kurth and Drew Geraci. The story set between the second and third ''Iron Man'' films centers on War Machine, revealing why he was absent during the battle in New York of ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="Hunt2013-02-02" /&gt;

Like with the first two films, [[Audi]] again provided [[product placement]] with various vehicles.&lt;ref name="Audi" /&gt; [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] also returned from ''Iron Man 2'', showcasing both the Oracle Cloud and the [[Oracle Exadata]] server.&lt;ref name="Oracle" /&gt; [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[TCL Corporation|TCL]]'s flat panel televisions and [[Alcatel One Touch]] smartphones are also featured in the film,&lt;ref name="investors" /&gt; and the Chinese cut also shows a [[Zoomlion]] crane and [[Yili Group|Yili]] milk.&lt;ref name="globaltimes" /&gt; Promotional deals were arranged with [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] and the [[Schwan Food Company]],&lt;ref name="investors" /&gt; and tie-ins included [[Lego]] sets,&lt;ref name="lego" /&gt; [[Hasbro]] action figures,&lt;ref name="hasbro" /&gt; and [[Iron Man 3: The Official Game|a mobile phone game]] by [[Gameloft]].&lt;ref name="mobilegame" /&gt;

Disney also promoted the film at its domestic theme parks. [[Disneyland]]'s [[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]] attraction received a [[Stark Industries]] exhibit beginning April 13, and Monorail Black of the [[Walt Disney World Monorail System]] was given an exterior ''Iron Man'' scheme.&lt;ref name="disneyparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="monorail" /&gt; The exhibit, entitled ''Iron Man Tech Presented by Stark Industries'', features the same armor display that was shown at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, with the Marks I-VII and the new Mark XLII. In addition, there is a simulator game, titled "Become Iron Man," that uses [[Kinect]]-like technology to allow the viewer to be encased in an animated Mark XLII armor and take part in a series of "tests," in which you fire repulsor rays and fly through Tony Stark's workshop. The game is guided by J.A.R.V.I.S., who is voiced again by Paul Bettany. The exhibit also has smaller displays that include helmets and chest pieces from the earlier films and the gauntlet and boot from an action sequence in ''Iron Man 3''.&lt;ref name="disneylandtech" /&gt;

''Iron Man 3'' was distributed worldwide by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]{{ref|1|1}} with the exception of [[China]], where it was released by [[DMG Yinji|DMG Entertainment]], and [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], where it was released by Tele München Group.&lt;ref name="DMGChina" /&gt; The Chinese version of the film offers specially prepared bonus footage made exclusively for the Chinese audience.&lt;ref name="ChineseRelease" /&gt; This version features a four-minute longer cut of the film, with a scene showing Dr. Wu on the phone with Iron Man visible on a television screen behind him, as well as a longer scene of Dr. Wu operating on Stark. The extra material also features [[product placement]] for various Chinese products.&lt;ref name="ChineseMaterial" /&gt;

The film's premiere happened at the [[Grand Rex]] in Paris, on April 14, 2013, with Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow in attendance.&lt;ref name="ParisPremiere" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ParisPremiere2" /&gt; While the UK premiere of the film was originally set for April 17, the funeral of former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] taking place in that date made the event be pushed to the following day.&lt;ref name="UKRelease" /&gt; Downey, Ben Kingsley and Rebecca Hall were present for the advance screening at London's [[Odeon Leicester Square]].&lt;ref name="LondonPremiere" /&gt; The [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles hosted the United States premiere of ''Iron Man 3'' on April 24.&lt;ref name="PremiereElCapitan" /&gt; The film opened in 46 countries through April 22–24,&lt;ref name="46countriesapril" /&gt; with the United States release, in 4,253 screens, happening one week later.&lt;ref name="BOM-lateThurs" /&gt; [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Cinemas]], [[AMC Theatres]] and [[Carmike Cinemas]] put presale tickets on hold, two weeks before the US premiere. The cinemas were in a contract dispute with Disney, who wished to receive more of the ticket sale profit than they currently did, largely based on the projected premiere-weekend intake ''Iron Man 3'' was expected to have. Carmike was the first to come to terms with Disney.&lt;ref name="DisneyTheaterDispute" /&gt; It was later reported that [[Cinemark Theatres]] had also stopped selling presale tickets, and Regal Cinemas had removed all marketing material for the film from its locations.&lt;ref name="DisputeCinemark" /&gt; On April 25, 2013, Regal, AMC and Disney ended their dispute, which allowed Regal and AMC to proceed with selling presale tickets again.&lt;ref name="AMCDisputeEnds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RegalDisputeEnds" /&gt;

IMAX screenings began on April 25, 2013 internationally and May 3 in the United States.&lt;ref name="IMAX" /&gt; The film was shown in the [[4DX]] format, featuring strobe lights, tilting seats, blowing wind and fog and odor effects in selected countries.&lt;ref name="4dx1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4dx2" /&gt; In [[Japan]], the technology opened its first room at the Korona World theatre in [[Nagoya]], Japan with the release of the film.&lt;ref name="4DX" /&gt;

===Critical response===
The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 80% approval rating with an average rating of 7/10 based on 307 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "With the help of its charismatic lead, some impressive action sequences, and even a few surprises, ''Iron Man 3'' is a witty, entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the Marvel canon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iron Man 3 (2013) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/iron_man_3/ |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave a score of 62 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/iron-man-3|title=Iron Man 3 Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an early review by the [[trade magazine]] ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', [[Todd McCarthy]] said that, "After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment ... [that] benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black.&lt;ref name="McCarthyReview" /&gt; Calling the film "darker and more serious than its predecessors," [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' credited Black for "chang[ing] this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is quite a bit of Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated."&lt;ref name="TuranReview" /&gt; Rafer Guzman of ''[[Newsday]]'' characterized Iron Man as "the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out."&lt;ref name="GuzmanReview" /&gt; ''[[Psychology Today]]'' concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref name="PsychologyToday" /&gt; Michael Arbeiter of [[Hollywood.com]] praised the film as "Marvel's First True Action-Comedy", commenting that "Tony's camaraderie with preteen tech geek Harley Keener is one gigantic superhero/'90s-kid-sidekick laugh riot (the friggin' kid's name is ''Harley Keener'' ... is there anything more '90s-kid-sidekick-sounding than that?!)."&lt;ref name="Arbeiter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/iron-man-3-robert-downey-jr-marvel-first-action-comedy-57391771/ |title=''Iron Man 3'' Is Marvel's First True Action-Comedy |author=Arbeiter, Michael |publisher=[[Hollywood.com]] |accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick De Semlyen of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] film magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' had criticisms, even while giving the film four of five stars. Finding it "a swinging caper with wit, balls, heart and exploding baubles," he said the villainous "super-soldiers who can regenerate body parts and survive astounding damage [are] visually interesting ... but their motivation is murky and unconvincing."&lt;ref name="EmpireReview" /&gt; Likewise Joshua Rothkopf of [[Time Out (magazine)|''Time Out'' New York]] bestowed 3 of 5 stars, saying, "Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book malleability in mind. ... The most wonderful of Black's surprises harkens back to his '80s reputation for character revision and is simply too good to ruin here." But, he asked, "[W]hy, finally, are we down at the docks—in the dark, no less—for one of those lumbering climaxes involving swinging shipping cranes? The energy bleeds out of the film; it's as if the producers were scared the crowd would riot over ''not enough'' digital fakeness."&lt;ref name="TONYReview" /&gt;

Reacting more negatively, Stephen Whitty of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' found the film "slickly enjoyable" for the visual effects, but said, "[T]here's something empty about the film. Like Tony's suits, it's shiny and polished. But this time, there's nobody inside ... This movie has neither the emotionalism of the first film, nor the flashy villains of the second ... Tony's relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts is in inexplicable jeopardy—and then simply fixes itself. A supposedly cute kid sidekick—a true sign of authorial desperation—is introduced, and then dropped."&lt;ref name="StarLedgerReview" /&gt; [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' echoed this, saying, "[I]n a gleefully cynical bid for a preteen audience (a few years too young for the violence in ''Iron Man 3'', I'd say), Stark befriends a bullied 8-year-old [sic] (Ty Simpkins) who becomes his tag-along and sometime savior ... Stark no longer needs to be in the Iron Man suit. He's able to operate the thing remotely when needed. The movie's like that too. It's decent superhero blockbustering, but rather remote and vaguely secondhand. At this point, even with Black's flashes of black humor, the machinery is more or less taking care of itself, offering roughly half of the genial wit and enjoyment of the first ''Iron Man''."&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribuneReview" /&gt;

==Future==

===Possible sequel===
In March 2013, Black stated that Downey's original contract with [[Marvel Studios]], which expired after the release of ''Iron Man 3'', may be extended in order for the actor to appear in a second ''Avengers'' film and at least one more ''Iron Man'' film. He said: "There has been a lot of discussion about it: 'Is this the last ''Iron Man'' for Robert [Downey, Jr.]?' Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [he] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://screenrant.com/iron-man-4-5-robert-downey-jr/ | title=Shane Black Teases Robert Downey Jr.'s Return For Iron Man 4 &amp; 5 | publisher=Screen Rant | accessdate=March 10, 2013 | last=Keyes | first=Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, Cheadle stated that ''Iron Man 3'' could be the final film in the series, saying, "The door is always left open in these kinds of movies especially when they do as well as they have done. I know there was talk of making sure we did this one right, and if it worked it could be the last one. There's room for more to be done with these characters. We're getting to a sweet spot with Tony and Rhodey, anyway."&lt;ref name="Cheadle2" /&gt; In September 2014, in regards to a fourth film, Downey said, "There isn't one in the pipe ... No, there's no plan for a fourth ''Iron Man''."&lt;ref name="VarietySept2014" /&gt; In April 2016, Downey stated that he was open to reprising his role in a potential fourth ''Iron Man'' film.&lt;ref name="I Could Do One More" /&gt;

===Marvel One-Shot===
{{main|All Hail the King}}
In February 2014, Marvel released the [[Marvel One-Shots|One-Shot]] film, ''All Hail the King'', on ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''{{'}}s home media, featuring Kingsley reprising his role as Trevor Slattery, and continues Slattery's story from the end of the film.&lt;ref name="AHTK" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a working relationship with fellow mixed martial arts promotion [[Deep (mixed martial arts)|Deep]] presided by [[Shigeru Saeki]] (also the Jewels supervisor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fight-hihokan.com/archives/51754515.html 2月19日はDEEPイベントですよ！]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the women MMA promotion Smackgirl faced severe financial difficulties caused by the unexpected departure of major sponsors and television network deals, an executive from Japanese event production company Archery Inc., Yuichi Ozono, formed the company Marverous Japan and acquired the assets and rights formerly belonging to Smackgirl parent company Kilgore.&lt;ref name="Jewels Gets Debut; Hioki-Sato Set for Shooto" /&gt; Since the reputation of Smackgirl was tarnished by all the problems it faced, it was decided to start anew.&lt;ref name="Jewels Gets Debut; Hioki-Sato Set for Shooto" /&gt;

On June 9, 2012, it was announced that Jewels has formed a strategic partnership with American promotion [[Invicta Fighting Championships]] to cross-promote the world’s top female fighters on their respective fight cards in the United States and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{start date|2013|05|25}} Jewels announced that it would cease operations as an independent company, with Yuichi Ozono, then head of Jewels, stepping down and Shigeru Saeki from [[Deep (mixed martial arts)|Deep]], formerly supervisor, taking the full direction, and transferring fighters and brand to the new '''Deep Jewels''' brand, which would be managed by '''[[Deep (mixed martial arts)|Deep]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Eggink01.jpg|thumb|Kasperle]]
'''Kasperle''', '''Kasper''', or '''Kasperl''' ([[Bavarian German]]: ''Káschberl'', [[Swabian German]]: ''Kaschberle'', [[Swiss German]]: ''Chaschperli'') is a famous and traditional [[puppet]] character from [[Austria]], [[German-speaking Switzerland]], and [[Germany]]. Its roots date to 17th century, and it was at times so popular that ''Kasperltheater'' was synonymous with ''puppet theater''. Kasperltheater includes the following characters: Kasper, Gretel, Seppel, Grandmother, princess, king, witch, robber, and crocodile. The older, more traditional Kasperle shows are very similar to "[[Punch and Judy|Mister Punch]]". There are also "Kasperle versions" of the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm]] and other [[fairy tales]] and of "modern fairy tales".

Kasper (known as Kasperl and Kasperle in southern Germany and Austria) is the hero of German puppet theater. The name Kasper probably comes from the ancient Persian meaning "keeper of the treasure." Tradition holds one of the [[three Magi]] who visited the Christ Child was named Caspar. This character also existed in the [[mystery plays]] of the medieval Church.  

The puppet Kasper, along with [[France]]'s [[Guignol]], and [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s [[Punch and Judy]] has his origins in the character of [[Pulcinella]], a [[stock character]] of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Commedia dell'Arte]]. Pulcinella was a violent character typically dressed in white clothing, a long white hat, and a black mask. The character is generally identified with [[Naples]].

The puppet character currently named Kasper first appeared in Munich in 1858 in a marionette play (The Enchanted Lily) by Graf Pocci.  Like his cousin Punch, the early Kasper used a slapstick to beat the devil, witch, and crocodile.

==The Hohnsteiner style==

In 1920, [[Max Jacob (puppeteer)|Max Jacob]] introduced the form of Kasper Theater recognized today.  Kasper became a positive hero, eventually stopped using the slapstick (except in Bavaria and Austria), and took on a more childlike quality. This form is called the Hohnsteiner style (after [[Hohnstein Castle (Saxon Switzerland)]] in [[Saxony]] where Max Jacob and his troupe lived and Kasper performances were held).  

Modern Kasper plays involve Kasper helping his friends (Grandma, Seppel, the Princess, etc.) with various problems. For example, the Witch turns Seppel into a chicken or someone steals Grandma's cake. The structure of Kasper theater is also used to retell Grimm Fairy Tales such as [[Hansel and Gretel]] and [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. In Southern Germany and Austria, Kasper is known as Kasperle or Kasperl (the diminutive form of Kasper).

Kasper and his friends come alive for children as soon as the play starts. When watching a skit, the children learn important values in a safe and healthy way.  In this world of make-believe, children are free to express their thoughts and creativity. While role-playing, children relive their daily experiences learning to understand the feelings of others, freeing themselves from fears and worries. Adults, whether playing along or just watching, can gain valuable insight into children’s motivations and feelings.  At the same time, children are also developing their motor and verbal skills.

Children spontaneously make up stories as puppet play progresses. They quickly begin to create their own situations and dialog.  The following pages provide several interesting stories and descriptions of the major characters. You will realize that puppet play isn’t just about fairy tales. Modern topics and themes are easily expressed and developed.

* Kasper is our unbeatable hero. He laughs and jokes, even in the face of danger. Kasper is always ready for an adventure with his friends. He uses puns, wordplay, and wit to win the day.  Since Kasper is childlike himself, children identify closely with him.  In the skits, children accompany Kasper on his adventures, and together they bravely face danger.
* Gretel is Kasper’s good friend. She is clever, practical, and helpful. She often helps Kasper by outsmarting the villains. She has many positive traits.
* Seppel is Kasper’s other good friend. He is easygoing, occasionally clever, and strong. He never passes up a good meal. He often warns Kasper about going on risky adventures and scares easily
* The Policeman represents authority and society’s laws. He is a good friend and helps to set things right. The Policeman is often asked for advice. Though he may overlook Kasper’s pranks, he will give Kasper a stern look or warning reinforcing the value of rules in society.
* The Robber is rotten, mean, filthy, a liar, and lazy to boot! He is very strong, but luckily he isn’t very bright. Hence, he is always caught and punished.  
* Besides being evil, stubborn, easily annoyed, and crafty, the Witch can cast spells and often teams up other villains. She is the role children frequently choose to act out aggression or unexpressed conflict.
* The Wizard is powerful, wise, and helpful. He only uses his powers for good. However, he tends to take himself too seriously, and when Kasper is having fun at his expense, he will often ask, “Don’t you know who I am?” The Wizard’s outrageous entrances are often a great source of laughter.
* The Crocodile has a large snapping mouth filled with sharp teeth. He is a mindless eating machine.
* Grandma is both wise and an expert on manners.  She is the calm point in any Kasper play.  Grandma often rewards Kasper and Seppel with sausages after their adventures.  By allowing her grandchildren their adventures without being too strict, Grandma leads the children down the path to individual identity.
* The King is powerful and just in his decisions.  He rewards the characters for their bravery.  It is often only with Kasper’s help that the King can remove danger from his realm. The royal family often represents the child’s own family.  These characters are also used to imitate adult relationships such as courtship and marriage.
* The Devil impersonates negative attributes, like egotism, greed or hunger for power. He attempts to seduce Kasper and others to give in to them, illustrating their destructive effects on the community to the audience.

==Other modern Kaspars==
[[Bread and Puppet Theater]], an [[United States of America|American]]-based company under the direction of [[Silesia]]n-born [[Peter Schumann]], often presents short skits by the fictitious "Rotten Idea Theater Company", which features multiple Kaspars.  The Kaspars are generally violent, dishonest tricksters, and play out some form of political or social [[satire]] while beating each other with clubs.

==Kasper’s cousins==

Punch was introduced in Great Britain in the seventeenth century by an Italian performer named [[Pietro Gimonde]].  The original Pulcinella was a [[marionette]].  Over time, his name was anglicized to "Punch," and he became a [[hand puppet]].  "Pleased as punch" and "beat the devil" probably originated from [[Punch and Judy]] puppet theater.

Whereas the Max Jacob-inspired Kaspar has abandoned much of the bawdiness of 17th century street performance, Punch embraces it.  The traditional Kasper and modern Punch use a slapstick to beat the crocodile, police, and even the Devil.  "Slapstick" originates from the Commedia Dell'arte baton made of wooden slats fastened together like a castanet. On impact, the slapstick makes a loud slapping sound. The term has become synonymous with physical comedy.

Punch is aggravated by his whining child, nagging wife (Judy), and ineffective bureaucracy. This eventually leads to Punch hitting other characters with his slapstick, but it is a very ritualized form of violence. Traditional shows ended with Punch defeating the ultimate evil and proclaiming "Huzzah, Huzzah, I've killed the Devil!"  In modern endings, Punch is punished by being swallowed by the crocodile, scared into repentance by a ghost, or arrested by the police.

Punch performances also differ from Kasper by use of a "swazzle." The swazzle is used to give Punch a high pitched, squeaky sound.  Punch performances are usually put on by "professors". In some cases, Punch may be unintelligible, and the "professor" must act as an interpreter.  

During the 19th Century, Punch performances could be easily found on the streets of England. Today, they are much less common. As a continuing English tradition, Punch performances are more likely to be found on the beach during holidays.

Forms of Pulcinella can be found throughout Europe and even [[Turkey]]. The characters have different names in various countries.  In France, he is known as Pulchinelle ([[Guignol]], a figure developed in the 19th century around [[Lyon]], shares many features with Pulchinelle but cannot be said to derive directly from Pulchinelle).  In the [[Netherlands]], he is Jan Klaassen, a character whose personality varies greatly from region to region—sometimes sweet, sometimes a trickster.  Turkey's [[Karagoz]] and the Greek Karaghiozis descend from a common Ottoman shadow puppet tradition; the origin of these traditions and the relationship, if any, to the Pulchinella "family" is unknown. Likewise, the Javanese shadow puppet figure of [[Petruk]], shares characteristics with these European figures—some Javanese identify Petruk as a European—and it is tempting but impossible to confirm a historical relationship.

Stravinsky made the Russian [[Petrushka]] famous with his [[Petrushka (ballet)|ballet of the same name]]. This story involves three puppets (Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor) that come to life. Eventually, Petrushka is murdered by the Moor out of jealousy for the Ballerina. In the final scene, it's discovered that Petrushka was just stuffed with hay all along.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32231">This is a '''list of professional wrestling memorial shows''' from the 1980s until the present day. Memorial shows have been historically important in the [[history of professional wrestling]], usually held in memory of a recently deceased wrestler, promoter or other well-known personality, and used to pay tribute to a particular individual's accomplishments and contributions to the industry. The proceeds are generally donated to family members or charitable organizations.

These shows were often held as a form of supercard, a major wrestling event not aired on [[pay-per-view]], and sometimes resulted interpromotional shows. These types of shows were rarely seen in the United States, the earliest being the [[Parade of Champions|Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions]] held in memory of [[David Von Erich]] from 1984-88, but have been common in Japan since the late 1980s. In North America, memorial shows are most often held by [[Independent circuit|independent wrestling promotions]] although mainstream organizations like [[WWE]] have occasionally dedicated specific episodes of ''[[WWE Raw]]'' to then current WWE wrestlers such as [[Owen Hart]] (1999), [[Eddie Guerrero]] (2005), and [[Chris Benoit]] (2007).

{{Advert|date=March 2017}}
The '''MicroTiles''' video display system from [[Christie (company)|Christie Digital]] is composed of modular 16" × 12" (408&amp;nbsp;mm × 306&amp;nbsp;mm) rear projection cube units that can be built together into a large [[video wall]]-style display. Each MicroTile unit contains a short-throw projector based on an LED light source and [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] optical imaging. The picture is formed onto the detachable front screen surface.

Because of the building-block nature of the system, the configuration of the overall screen area and shape is flexible, leading to simple traditional rectangular displays, and more complex non-standard shapes.

Every MicroTile unit has sensors in each side that detect whether there is another unit next to it, allowing the display controller to automatically determine the tile layout and the size and magnification of the video picture to be displayed across the screen area.

The MicroTiles system has design features for simple installation and setup that minimise the need for detailed configuration of the screens and display controller.

The system was in development for two years before being launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gizmag.com/christie-micro-tiles-digital-canvasv/13362 | title = Christie MicroTiles create a versatile digital display wall|publisher=gizmag.com|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first publicly announced during an [[SEGD]] conference in New York on 11 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.segd.org/2009/11/what-does-collaboration-look-like|title=What does Collaboration look like?|publisher=Society for Environmental Graphic Design|accessdate=2010-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812162023/http://blog.segd.org/2009/11/what-does-collaboration-look-like/|archivedate=2011-08-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official launch event was at the Touch nightclub in Manhattan, New York, on 9 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.inavateonthenet.net/article.aspx?ArticleID=30410 | title = Christie MicroTiles launch draws a crowd | publisher = inAVate | accessdate = 2010-06-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091228191824/http://www.inavateonthenet.net/article.aspx?ArticleID=30410 | archivedate = 2009-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch in Europe was at the [http://www.iseurope.org ISE] trade show in Amsterdam, 2–4 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avinteractive.co.uk/news/20287/christie-reveals-full-microtile-details-at-ise-launch|title=Christie reveals full MicroTile details at ISE launch|publisher=AV Interactive magazine|accessdate=2010-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006161619/http://www.avinteractive.co.uk/news/20287/christie-reveals-full-microtile-details-at-ise-launch|archivedate=2011-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following North America and Europe, the system was launched in Japan on 22 April 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailydooh.com/archives/26017| title = Christie Launches MicroTiles Across Asia|publisher=DailyDOOH|accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then throughout the rest of Asia in the months following.

== System design ==

The system was invented in 2005 by Christie Digital's Bob Rushby, chief technology officer, and Mike Perkins, senior product developer, while in a Tokyo hotel bar during a business trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avinteractive.co.uk/news/20714/the-christie-microtiles-story|title=The CHRISTIE MicroTiles Story|publisher=AV Interactive magazine|accessdate=2010-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006161712/http://www.avinteractive.co.uk/news/20714/the-christie-microtiles-story|archivedate=2011-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Color Reproduction and Resolution ===
The system is capable of exceeding the [[NTSC]] specification for colour [[gamut]] by 115%. Because the LED light engine has a saturated color output, the image appears to be about 25% brighter than a similar lamp-based projector with the same lumen output. This is due to the [[Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect|Helmholtz Kohlrausch Effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://displaydaily.com/2009/06/18/led-projection-enters-the-mainstream|title=LED Projection Enters the Mainstream|publisher=DisplayDaily from Insight Media|accessdate=2010-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122191250/http://displaydaily.com/2009/06/18/led-projection-enters-the-mainstream/|archivedate=2010-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mike Perkins, the subjective effect of this is that the purer colors from MicroTiles are punchier, more vivid, and more engaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avinteractive.co.uk/news/20714/the-christie-microtiles-story|title=The CHRISTIE MicroTiles Story|publisher=AV Interactive magazine|accessdate=2010-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006161712/http://www.avinteractive.co.uk/news/20714/the-christie-microtiles-story|archivedate=2011-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each tile has a native resolution of 720x540 with a pixel pitch of 0.57&amp;nbsp;mm. The total resolution of the display can be a maximum of the sum of the native resolutions of each tile. Lower input resolutions are automatically up-scaled to fill the display area, which effectively increases the pixel pitch of the image displayed.

=== Self-configuring ===
Christie’s engineers worked to eliminate the need for calibrating the display manually. Each tile has microprocessor control to communicate with neighboring tiles to auto-adjust and balance both the color and brightness across all the tiles in the display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avinteractive.co.uk/news/20714/the-christie-microtiles-story|title=The CHRISTIE MicroTiles Story|publisher=AV Interactive magazine|accessdate=2010-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006161712/http://www.avinteractive.co.uk/news/20714/the-christie-microtiles-story|archivedate=2011-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electronic control unit (ECU) talks to each tile and creates an internal map of each tile position, and scales the video input across the whole display.

=== Maintenance ===
The servicing of a MicroTile unit in a display has also been a primary design consideration. Servicing is done from the front, and all major components, including the light engine, can be replaced in 15 minutes or less. This can be carried out without shutting down or dismantling the rest of the display. The LED light source is rated at 65,000 hours lifespan to 50% brightness. This is the equivalent of the system running continuously for 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proaudio-central.com/Publications/Pro-Audio-Middle-East/R-and-D/403-/Sign-of-the-times|title=Sign of the times|publisher=Pro Audio Middle East magazine|accessdate=2010-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715114838/http://www.proaudio-central.com/Publications/Pro-Audio-Middle-East/R-and-D/403-/Sign-of-the-times|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical details ==

=== Projector engine ===
The projector light engine is based on a Luminus Devices, Inc. PhatLight LED chipset&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20100609006222&amp;newsLang=en|title = Luminus Devices’ PhlatLight LEDs Illuminate Christie MicroTile’s New Digital Canvas Display|publisher=Businesswire|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses a TI [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] [[digital micromirror device]]. The short throw lens rear projects the image onto the removable tile screen.

=== Cabinet Design ===
[[Image:MicroTile Unit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|MicroTile unit with suction cup tool for front screen removal]]
The 10.2" (260&amp;nbsp;mm) depth tile chassis is equipped with precision fittings allowing tiles to be mated to each other side by side both horizontally and vertically, allowing displays of various shapes and sizes to be built. The screen is a matt-finished polycarbonate material mounted on a metal frame which is held onto the front of the tile cabinet magnetically. The frame is designed so that the seams visible in the picture between each tile in a screen array are kept to a minimum of about 1&amp;nbsp;mm. The power and signal connectors are on the rear of the cabinet, and once installed, there is no further need to access the rear panel for adjustments or maintenance. All mechanical maintenance is carried out from the front of the unit, with access gained by detaching the magnetically held screen with a suction grip tool.

=== Video Input and Control ===
The video input to the system is via a DVI connector on the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), and it can accept video modes up to [[WUXGA]] (1920x1200). This is typically fed from a video processor or media player with a [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] interface as the video output. The ECU is also connected to the MicroTiles in a daisy chain or [[ring network]] using a customised version of the [[DisplayPort]] interface.

As well as carrying the video information, the DisplayPort links carry two way control and monitoring signalling between the tiles and the ECU. The ECU performs automatic calibration of light output and color control, to ensure that the picture displayed is uniform across the array of tiles. MicroTiles displays can use multiple ECUs to allow higher resolution images to be displayed on large arrays. In this case one ECU arbitrates to become the master, and it assumes the role for device control, the other slave ECUs are just used for image signal processing.

The MicroTiles display system can be configured in shapes and sizes which don't conform to standard rectangular aspect ratio shapes and resolutions, and the number of pixels in the WUXGA video mode (about 2.3 million) is near the maximum that one ECU can display on a MicroTiles display. This allows resolutions to be displayed on smaller tile arrays at the native 0.57mm pixel pitch (for up to six tiles) - larger arrays need more ECUs to be added to the system, which means that multiple media player outputs will be needed to drive the extra ECUs. If the highest quality native resolution display is not necessary, then lower resolution video inputs to the ECUs will be scaled across the display.

Built in sensors in the cabinet top, bottom and sides allow the ECU to communicate with each tile and discover its neighbors, allowing it to map the array layout automatically. The ECU will then tell each tile what portion of the video input to display, so that an entire image is correctly formed and scaled across the whole display.

The ECU monitors the light output of the LED light sources in each tile and automatically adjusts the color and brightness of each tile to ensure the picture is uniform over the whole array.

== Examples in Use ==
Since the product launch, the system has been used in some installations that can be seen by the public:
* In January 2010, the re-designed television set of the US show [[The Colbert Report]] contained four angled vertical columns of MicroTiles behind the presenter, and three horizontal displays around the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailydooh.com/archives/25526 | title = Colbert Set Builders Praise Christie MicroTiles|publisher=DailyDOOH|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newscaststudio.com/blog/2010/04/12/christie-microtiles-help-give-colbert-report-a-unique-screen | title = Christie MicroTiles help give ‘Colbert Report’ a unique screen|publisher=newscaststudio|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[NASCAR Hall of Fame]] opened in May 2010 in Charlotte, North Carolina, with a large display made  up of 252 MicroTiles (a 14&amp;nbsp;ft x18 ft "fan Billboard") flown from the roof in the Great Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightingandsoundamerica.com/news/story.asp?ID=63A2OZ|title=NASCAR Hall of Fame Turns to Electrosonic for AV|publisher=Lighting &amp; Sound America magazine|accessdate=2010-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727154142/http://www.lightingandsoundamerica.com/news/story.asp?ID=63A2OZ|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  The ChristieMicroTile wall at the [[University of Waterloo Stratford Campus]] is three stories tall and made up of 150 individual MicroTiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.southwesternontario.ca/news/new-digital-landscape-takes-root-in-stratford/ | title = Business, technology and art converge at new UW campus in Stratford|publisher=southwesternontario.ca|accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile privatization''' can be described as an individual's attachment to a [[mobile device]] which leads to a feeling of being "at home," while connected to this device in a mobile setting. An individual can travel anywhere while still feeling comfortable because of the connectivity of their mobile device. The connection creates a sense of familiarity which results in the individual's identity becoming attached to their mobile service provider. This concept leads to the idea that "home" need not be a domestic structure featuring walls and a roof, but that the mobile sense of connection provides a portable community similar to a home environment.

==History of the concept==
The term was first used by [[Raymond Williams]] in his 1974 book ''Television: Technology and Cultural Form'' (Routledge, 3rd ed., 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-31456-9}}). Williams described the main contradiction in modern society as the one between mobility and home-centered living. He considered that television can negotiate that contradiction by providing users privacy to view the world.

Paul du Gay, of the [[Copenhagen Business School]], developed this theory in 2001. His main perspective was that home, for Williams, is a shrunken social space where isolated individuals gain vicariously increased mobility. Accordingly, he introduced the concept of “mobile privatised social relations”. Henrikson{{who|date=December 2013}} applied the concept of [[Technological Determinism]] to conclude that “Technologies can be designed, consciously or unconsciously, to open certain social options and close others”.

In 2005, Kenichi Fujimoto, Professor of Informatics and Mediology at [[Mukogawa Women's University]], came up with a theory called "Nagara Mobilism". Nagara means people have the ability to handle different process like text video and sound at the same time. He reaffirmed the contradiction between the physical and virtual home, and explained that increased privacy of public space can make the contradiction stronger. In 2007, the term [[Glocalization]] was introduced. It means that when individuals utilize mobile technology, their social networks expand while making themselves much closer to the local community.

[[Hans Geser]], a professor at the [[University of Zürich]], has isolated four main features of mobile technology that weaken societal development: 
*By increasing the pervasiveness of primary, particularistic social bonds. 
*By reducing the need for time based scheduling and coordination. 
*By undermining institutional controls and replacing location-based communication systems with person-based. 
*By providing support for anachronistic “pervasive roles”.

'''Nehanda Radio''' is a [[Zimbabwe]]an online radio station that provides 24-hour updated news on Zimbabwe. The station is run by exiled journalist [[Lance Guma]].

The project also recently launched [[Nehanda TV]] which aims at promoting Zimbabwean videos.  This is important for the voice of democracy and freedom of information in emerging democracies such as Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has harsh Media laws and projects like Nehanda Radio serve to keep Zimbabweans informed.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Opera glasses''', also known as '''theater binoculars''' or '''Galilean binoculars''', are compact, low-power optical magnification devices, usually used at performance events, whose name is derived from traditional use at [[opera]] performances. Magnification power below 5× is usually desired in these circumstances in order to minimize image shake and maintain a large enough [[field of view]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Choose Opera Glasses|url=http://binoscopes.org/consumer/opera-glasses.html|accessdate=24 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508185859/http://binoscopes.org/consumer/opera-glasses.html|archivedate=8 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A magnification of 3× is normally recommended. The design of many modern opera glasses of the ornamental variety is based on the popular [[lorgnette]]s of the 19th century.

The [[London Opera Glass Company]] was founded in 1913 and provides opera glasses in many of [[London]]'s [[West End theatre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs085/1101966345958/archive/1102666739235.html|title=Two famous London theatres get Opera Glasses in time for new productions|work=Theatre Views Newsletter| date=Summer 2009 | accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs085/1101966345958/archive/1107747364051.html |title=1.8 million views of ''Lion King''|work=Theatre Views Newsletter| date=October 2011 | accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical history==
Papa Wemba's road to fame and prominence began when he joined the music group [[Zaiko Langa Langa]] in the late 1960s. This was followed by his success as a founding member both of [[Isifi Lokole]] and then [[Yoka Lokole]],&lt;ref group="n"&gt;"Both groups used the [[lokole]], a hollow tree trunk played with two sticks, as a rhythmic foundation"&lt;/ref&gt; along with a short stint as a member of [[Afrisa International]] for a few months.&lt;ref name="Brazzaville Futé"/&gt; During these early stages of his career, he was establishing a style that included traditional Congolese rumba and soukous, infused with traditional African sounds, Caribbean rhythms, rock and [[Soul music|soul]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; But Wemba gained international success and status with his band [[Viva La Musica]],&lt;ref name="musicianguide.com"/&gt; especially after he took them to [[Paris, France]] in the early 1980s. It was there that Wemba was able to achieve more of an "eclectic sound" in his work,&lt;ref name="africanmusic.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanmusic.org/artists/wemba.html|title=African Music Encyclopedia: Papa Wemba|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by western popular music that reflected a European flavor and style, referred to as "[[Europop]]."&lt;ref name="dico"/&gt; Wemba spoke about this transition in his music during a 2004 interview:

{{quote|“When I started singing pop music, I left religious music completely. But there was always the influence of religious music on my voice because, with religious music, the minor key always recurs. When I compose songs, I often use the minor key.”&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;}}

===Zaiko Langa Langa=== 
Papa Wemba was one of the first musicians to join the influential rock-rumba&lt;ref name="Brazzaville Futé"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auzias|first1=Dominique|last2=Labourdette|first2=Jean-Paul|title=Congo Brazzaville 2012-13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8DYHZoIBnMC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Papa+Wemba&amp;hl=mg&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiwLT0zK3MAhVIVhoKHau2CdQQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Papa%20Wemba&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; band ''Zaiko Langa Langa'' (ZLL) after it was created in December 1969&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3475|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Papa Wemba|last=Harris|first=Craig|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kinshasa]],&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; by many well-known Congolese musicians including [[Nyoka Longo Jossart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/showbiz/Final-Call-for-Papa-Wemba/-/1950810/3174936/-/2ony6d/-/index.html|title=Final Call for Papa Wemba|date=25 April 2016|work=Daily Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bimi Ombale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bimi-ombale-mn0001588358|title=Bimi Ombale|author=Steve Huey|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. He remained with the group for four years.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Papa Wemba (then known as Jules Presley Shungu Wembadio) helped contribute to the success of ''Zaiko Langa Langa'' so that, by 1973, it was one of the more successful Congolese groups. By that time, ZLL's shows and performances featured a string of their popular hits, some of them written by Wemba. The latter included "Pauline", "C'est La Vérité", "Chouchouna", and "Liwa Ya Somo".&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

''Zaiko Langa Langa'' had gained a strong and popular following even in a Congolese musical world that, in those days, was already dominated by various musical acts including  [[Francois Luambo Makiadi|Franco Luambo]] and his band [[TPOK Jazz]], or [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]]'s various ensembles.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; ZLL was also vying for an audience with other (at the time) new musical acts such as [[Orchestre Bella Bella|Bella-Bella]] and [[Empire Bakuba]].&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batheatres.com/d/papa-wemba.com/|title=Papa Wemba-Official Website-Bienvenue|publisher=papa-wemba.com}} Note: this website is in French (top of the page) and English (bottom of the page).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isifi Lokole===
In December 1974, at the pinnacle of their fame (and just a month after the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]] in Kinshasa),&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; Papa Wemba (usually called 'Shungu Wembadio' at this point in his career) along with Evoloko Lay Lay, Mavuela Somo and [[Bozi Boziana]],&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"/&gt; left Zaiko Langa Langa to establish their own musical ensemble ''Isifi Lokole.''&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; Wemba later claimed that ISIFI was an [[acronym]] for "Institut du Savoir Ideologique pour la Formation des Idoles," a claim that has still not been given total credence. In July 1975, Shungu Wembadio officially adopted the soon-to-be-well-known-worldwide name ''Papa Wemba''. The "Papa" (father) part of his name had already been given to him as a traditional and cultural rite because he was his mother's first-born son.&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"/&gt; But in assuming a new name and public persona, "Papa" was now re-emphasized as an allusion to the demanding family responsibilities that Wemba assumed at very young age, since both parents were now deceased: Wemba's father in 1966, followed by his mother in 1973.&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="musicianguide.com"/&gt; ''Isifi Lokole'' would only last a year together as a group, with the single "Amazone" (a Wemba composition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Isifi-Amazone/release/8291396|title=Isifi - Amazone|work=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its biggest commercial "hit" record.

===Yoka Lokole===
In November 1975, Papa Wemba, Mavuela Somo and Bozi Boziana left ''Isifi Lokole'' to create the group ''Yoka Lokole''&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"/&gt; (also known as The Kinshasa's Wa Fania All-Stars).&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"/&gt; ''Yoka Lokole'' contributed to the African pop music wave with their hit songs including "Matembele Bangui", "Lisuma ya Zazu" (Papa Wemba), "Mavuela Sala Keba", and "Bana Kin" (Mavuela Somo).&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"/&gt;

Like ''Isifi Lokole'', the electronic-instrument-driven ''Yoka Lokole'' would not last much longer than a year.&lt;ref name="Brazzaville Futé"/&gt; After a year of modest success, controversies within ''Yoka Lokole'' over money and prestige were also complicated by Wemba's arrest and brief incarceration in Kinshasa Central prison in December 1976 &lt;ref name="bbc.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-36123966|title=Obituary: Papa Wemba|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the "crime" of being suspected of having had physical intimacy with an army general's daughter.&lt;ref name="bbc.com1"/&gt; The band continued to tour without Papa Wemba. For whatever reason (or reasons), whether it was personal or professional (with one source speculating that he was perhaps feeling diminished in the public's eye),&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"/&gt; by 1977 Wemba had formed a new group, and called it ''Viva la Musica''.&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

===Viva la Musica===
In 1977-78, back home now in the [[Matonge (Kinshasa)|Matonge]] neighborhood of Kinshasa, Papa Wemba set out to create his group ''Viva la Musica''. This new band's name was suggested to him in 1974, when he attended a concert in Kinshasa that featured the New York-based Latinos, ''[[Fania All-Stars]]''. During the concert, one of the singers would shout to the audience "Viva La Musica!" to an enthusiastic response.&lt;ref name="nostalgieyamboka"/&gt; Wemba's vision was to structure ''Viva la Musica'' around young, talented but largely unknown artists, including the singers Prince Espérant, Jadot "le Cambodgien" Sombele, Pepe Bipoli and Petit Aziza, and various guitarists such as [[Rigo Star]], Syriana, and Bongo Wende.&lt;ref name=Stewart224/&gt; The new group included the traditional instrument [[lokole]]. There was also an associated dance, the [[mukonyonyo]], as well as a fashion style.&lt;ref name="Brazzaville Futé"/&gt;

The band achieved immediate success and, during their first year performing together, the Kinshasa newspaper ''Elima'' named the band "best orchestra" and their single, "Mère Supérieure," best song.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; During the following three years, ''Viva la Musica'' built on these initial accolades with more hit songs including "Moku Nyon Nyon", "Nyekesse Migue'l", and "Cou Cou Dindon".&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; As time went by, it was revealed that Antoine Agbepa was the unknown writer of many of these songs, when Papa Wemba said, "Ooh! l'homme idée" (Oh! the idea-man!), thereby on-the-spot renaming the impressive young singer-songwriter [[Koffi Olomide]] - and the name stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigeye.ug/10-things-didnt-know-koffi-olomide/|title=10 Things You Didn’t Know About Koffi Olomide!|work=Bigeye.ug}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his success already with three influential groups, in 1977 Papa Wemba established a kind of commune for musicians. To accomplish this, he used his family home (on Kanda-Kanda street) as a fashionable gathering place for Matonge youths. He named it "Village Molokai" and declared himself to be its [[tribal chief]] (''chef coutumier'').&lt;ref name=Stewart224&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Gary|title=Rumba on the River: A History of the Popular Music of the Two Congos|year=2000|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1859843680|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Paris===
Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wemba (both by himself and with Viva la Musica) started traveling to Paris,&lt;ref name="africanmusic.org"/&gt; believing there was a potentially wider audience for the music he had been helping to create during the preceding decade. As Wemba biographer Craig Harris put it:{{quote|"Determined to capture a European following, Wemba and Viva La Musica vocalist Rigo Star took a six-month sabbatical from the band in 1979 to join Tabu Ley Rochereau's group, Afrisa International. Relocating to Paris in the early '80s, Wemba formed a second version of Viva la Musica."&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;}}

[[File:Papa Wemba.jpg|thumb|Papa Wemba, photographed in 2009]]
By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Wemba's style was more readily identifiable even as it had become an amalgamation of rhumba, soukous and ndombolo, Latin and rock, melded to a European-oriented pop style.&lt;ref name="dico"/&gt; &lt;!--With the wave of African emigration to Europe in the 1990s--&gt;But still wanting to expand their musical horizons, and move in new musical directions,&lt;ref name="dico"/&gt; ''Viva la Musica'' took on a dual-identity. Wemba now maintained one group in Kinshasa (called at times "Nouvelle Ecriture", "Nouvel Ecrita" and then again "Viva la Musica") and another one in Paris ("Nouvelle Generation," "La Cour des Grands" and now "Viva Tendance"). The group consistently maintained a high profile in world music with hits like "Le Voyageur" (1992),&lt;ref name="dico"/&gt; "Emotion" (1995),&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; "Pole Position" (1996) and "Somo Trop" (October, 2003).&lt;ref name="batheatres.com"/&gt;

By this time, Wemba's use of African, Cuban and Western influences was not only one of Africa's most popular music styles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0920707/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm | title=Imdb Biography: Papa Wemba | publisher=Imdb | accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was crossing cultural boundaries and attracting a more diverse audience outside of Africa. In 1993, Wemba joined with [[Peter Gabriel]] for the latter's ''[[Secret World Live]]'' tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1479394/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_1|title=The Real World of Peter Gabriel (TV Movie 2009)|date=6 August 2009|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this drew attention to Wemba's unique style and groundbreaking sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theimproper.com/music/6253/peter-gabriels-secret-world-revisited-dvd-bluray/|title=Peter Gabriel's 'Secret World' Revisited on DVD, Blu-Ray|work=TheImproper.com: Music News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned ''Emotion'' album, released in 1995, showed that he was achieving a global following.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; This album appeared under Peter Gabriel's Real World record label, and sold more than 100,000 copies.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

==Legal troubles==
In February 2003, Wemba was suspected of being involved in a network that had allegedly smuggled hundreds of illegal immigrants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo into Europe.&lt;ref name=BBC2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Congolese singer in French court|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3949935.stm#|accessdate=27 April 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=26 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point he was arrested in Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/apr/24/papa-wemba-congolese-musics-dandy-with-a-dark-side|title=Papa Wemba: Congolese music's dandy with a dark side|author=Robin Denselow|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held while awaiting a trial. He then spent three-and-a-half months in prison until a €30,000 bail was posted (some reports claimed it was paid by the Congolese government).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/papa-wemba-the-daddy-of-them-all-45386.html|title=Papa Wemba: The Daddy of them all|date=3 July 2004|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wemba was released in June 2003, an experience that, upon his release, he declared had had a profound psychological effect on him. The singer claimed to have undergone a spiritual conversion in jail&lt;ref name=BBC2004/&gt; and even recounted this episode on his album ''Somo Trop'' (released in October 2003). On the song "Numéro d'écrou", he recalled the day "God" paid a visit to his cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/papa-wemba-dead-congolese-singer-dies-after-collapsing-on-stage-in-abidjan-a6998301.html|title=Papa Wemba dead: Congolese musician dies after collapsing on stage aged 66|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|date=24 April 2016|publisher=Independent|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he was convicted in France, fined and given a suspended prison sentence.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/04/25/475583946/remembering-african-singer-and-style-icon-papa-wemba|title=Remembering African Singer And Style Icon Papa Wemba|date=25 April 2016|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wemba then returned to the Congo in 2006&lt;ref name="Brazzaville Futé"/&gt; and continued playing music until his death.

==Cultural influence==
In 1979, Papa Wemba became the unofficial leader of [[La Sape]] (Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes d'Élégance, literally translated as the "Society of Atmosphere-setters and Elegant People") which he promoted as a [[youth subculture]] in Zaire.&lt;ref name="inside-africa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Idole des Congolais et roi de la rumba, Papa Wemba est mort sur scène|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/flash-actualite-culture/papa-wemba-roi-de-la-rumba-congolaise-et-prince-de-la-sape-24-04-2016-5741423.php|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=AFP|publisher=[[Le Parisien]]|date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their style was influenced by the fashion centres of Paris and [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="dico"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gates|first1=Henry Louis|last2=Akyeampong|first2=Emmanuel|last3=Niven|first3=Steven J.|title=Dictionary of African Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA166&amp;dq=Papa+Wemba&amp;hl=mg&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiwLT0zK3MAhVIVhoKHau2CdQQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Papa%20Wemba&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wemba said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Sapeur cult promoted high standards of personal cleanliness, hygiene and smart dress, to a whole generation of youth across Zaire. When I say well groomed, well shaved, well perfumed, it's a characteristic that I am insisting on among the young. I don't care about their education, since education always comes first of all from the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aozj17.dsl.pipex.com/enter_the_sape.html|title=Papa Wemba &amp; Viva La Musica - Enter the Sape|author=nostalgie ya mboka|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Wemba's death, Cameroonian saxophonist [[Manu Dibango]] told the BBC during an interview:

{{quote|"His whole attitude about dressing well was part of the narrative that we Africans have been denied our humanity for so long. People have always had stereotypes about us, and he was saying dressing well is not just a matter of money, not just something for Westerners, but that we Africans also have elegance. It was all about defining ourselves and refusing to be stripped of our humanity."&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;}}

Papa Wemba's impact on the culture is also reflected by his influence on a new generation of musicians and performers. For example, Priyan Weerappuli (leader of the Sri Lankan group [[Pahan Silu]]) referred to Wemba as being among his greatest musical influences.&lt;ref name="pahansilu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pahansilu.com/members.php|title=Pahan Silu Homepage - Member Biographies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weerappuli claims that he was first introduced to Wemba's music in 2004 and was "deeply inspired by the free rhythms demonstrated by Wemba's Soukous style" and, from that point, "began experimenting with these rhythms in his own compositions."&lt;ref name="pahansilu.com"/&gt;

Many others paid tribute to Papa Wemba's legacy after his death in April 2016. Some of them included not only Koffi Olomide and Manu Dibango (both mentioned previously), but musicians King Kikii and [[Femi Kuti]], along with soccer star [[Samuel Eto'o]] (among others) gave testimony to his lasting influence on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36128441|title=Papa Wemba: Stars remember the 'voice of Africa'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film work==
Papa Wemba got some attention as a movie actor, primarily because he played the male lead role in a very successful Zairean film ''[[La Vie est Belle (1987 film)|La Vie est Belle]]'' (Life is Beautiful) [1987] by Belgian director [[Benoît Lamy]] and Congolese producer-director [[Ngangura Mweze]].&lt;ref name="njaj1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094265/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_3|title=Life Is Rosy (1987)|author=njaj1|date=15 June 1988|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wemba made another kind of contribution to cinema, thanks to his work on the soundtracks for ''[[Children of Men]]'', ''[[Besieged]]'', and ''Black Mic Mac''. Wemba is also credited as "composer" of the scores for the films ''[[Identity Pieces]]'', ''[[Macadam tribu]]'', along with ''Life is Beautiful.''.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0920707/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm|title=Papa Wemba: Filmography |work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life Wemba acted in a few more successful films, although he played only minor roles. As recently as 2012, he had a cameo role in the Belgian drama film ''[[Kinshasa Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popoptiq.com/nyff-2012-kinshasa-kids/|title=NYFF 2012: Kinshasa Kids|author=Kenneth|work=PopOptiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the impact of his important role in ''Life is Beautiful'', there are his many music videos and recorded band performances. Also, Wemba is featured (as himself) in many documentary films which were generally well received including; ''The Importance of Being Elegant'', ''The Real World of Peter Gabriel'' and ''The African Rock 'n' Roll Years'' (all television) documentaries).&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt;

==Death==
Wemba died at the age of 66 after [[Syncope (medicine)|collapsing]] on stage in [[Abidjan]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], during the FEMUA urban music festival on Sunday, 24 April 2016.&lt;ref name="BBC-obit"/&gt; On Monday, April 25, it was reported that his widow, Mama-Marie Luzolo Amazone, flew to Abidjan "accompanied by family members and government officials."&lt;ref name="nation.co.ke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/showbiz/Papa-Wemba-body-to-be-flown-home/-/1950810/3176808/-/t07hviz/-/index.html|title=Papa Wemba’s body to be flown home|date=26 April 2016|work=Daily Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wemba's hometown of Kinshasa, both fellow musicians and fans gathered together as a tribute to his legacy. Similar tributes also took place in Paris, London, Brussels and Nairobi.&lt;ref name="nation.co.ke"/&gt;

'''Phantom rides''' or '''panoramas''' were an early [[film genre|genre of film]] popular in Britain and the US at the end of the 19th century. Pre-dating true [[narrative]], the films simply show the progress of a vehicle moving forwards, usually shot by strapping a cameraman to the front. The term ''phantom ride'' was applied because the position of the camera meant that only the track and scenery could be seen and the movement appeared to be coming from an invisible force. Though many early films showed local tracks the demand for new footage led to more exotic locations being filmed.  This brought a new dimension to the genre, showing foreign lands to those who would otherwise never see them. The genre is also significant, despite its short-lived popularity, due to the role it played in the development of the [[tracking shot]], longer films and [[film editing]],&lt;ref name="SCRFG"&gt;{{Citation | last = Gray | first = Frank | chapter = The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899), G.A.

[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1193042/ Phantom Rides], [[British Film Institute|BFI Screen Online]].  Accessed 30 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its re-emergence in [[4D film]] and [[simulation]].

==History==
Most films before phantom rides used static cameras with all the action happening within the scene.  This new style of film-making popularised the idea of motion created by the movement of the camera. [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|American Mutoscope]]'s ''[[The Haverstraw Tunnel]]'' (1897), featuring a train travelling along the [[West Shore Railroad]] in New York and then through the eponymous tunnel, and the [[Lumière brothers]]' ''[[Leaving Jerusalem by Railway]]'' (1897), featuring a train leaving Jerusalem, are considered the first examples of the phantom ride genre.  The audience were wowed by the speed and unique perspectives that these films introduced, for the first time experiencing the view of travelling while seated in a small hall.  

Screenings of ''The Haverstraw Tunnel'' (1897) in London in October of that year proved to be an instant success with a reviewer in ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' writing that, "A more exciting and sensational piece of realism has never been presented to an audience." Starting the following year, Mutoscope's British subsidiary filmed and released their own phantom rides, including ''Conway Castle - Panoramic View of Conway on the L. &amp; N.W. Railway'' (1898) and ''Through Chee Tor Tunnel in Derbyshire - Midland Railway'', as did rival companies such as the Warwick Trading Company.&lt;ref name="SCRFG" /&gt; 

The phantom ride genre contributed to the emergence of longer film as distributors grouped their films together to form single journeys, such as the Warwick Trading Company's ''View from an Engine Front - Through Morthoe'' (1898) and ''View from an Engine Front - Ilfracombe Incline'' (1898) which were made available together as a single continuous length of film. Concurrent technological developments resulted in the Warwick Trading Company's 12-minute epic ''Dalmeny to Dunfermline, Scotland, via the Firth of Forth Bridge'' (1899), billed as "the longest, most picturesque and interesting Cinematograph film ever produced."&lt;ref name="SCRFG" /&gt;

[[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]]'s ''The Kiss in the Tunnel'' (1899) was a single shot of a couple sharing a brief kiss as their train passes through a tunnel, that was produced to be spliced into existing phantom ride footage, such as [[Cecil Hepworth]]'s ''View from an Engine Front - Train Leaving Tunnel'' (1899), to add interest to the genre.&lt;ref name="BFIso01"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Kiss in the Tunnel |first=Michael |last=Brooke |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444230/index.html |work=BFI Screenonline Database |date= |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BF01"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Kiss in the Tunnel |first=David |last=Fisher |coauthors= |url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_kiss_in_the_tunnel.htm |work=Brightonfilm.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This insertion of a single shot into another film indicates, according to film historian Frank Gray, "a new understanding of continuity film editing," which, "would have a profound impact on the development of editing strategies and become a dominant practice."&lt;ref name="SCRFG" /&gt;

The concept of phantom rides was to dramatically change with the opening of [[Hale's Tours of the World]] in 1906.  A predecessor to modern [[simulation|simulators]] and [[4-D film]]s, these shows involved more than just the projected film footage.  The cinema itself was designed to physically mimic the experience of being in the carriage of a train, with piped sounds of train whistles and rushing steam adding to the visuals.  The benching was even designed to shake to add realism to the feeling of movement along the track.  Hale's Tours were successful enough for them to open four venues in London and several others across the UK.&lt;ref name="BFI" /&gt;

The rapid development of film-making techniques meant that the audience quickly moved onto other things and by 1910 they no longer accepted these single-shot visuals.  Narrative in film progressed and phantom rides were demoted to being one scene out of several in more story-driven movies.&lt;ref name="BFI" /&gt;

'''Picigin''' ({{IPA-sh|pit͡sǐgiːn|hr}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hrvatski jezični portal|url=http://hjp.novi-liber.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&amp;id=eV5jXRk%3D&amp;keyword=picigin|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is traditional ball game from [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatia]] that is played on the [[beach]]. It is an amateur sport played in shallow water consisting of players keeping a small ball from touching the water.

==Origin==
[[File:Picigin Crikvenica 011007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A game of picigin]]
Picigin originated on the sandy beach of [[Bačvice]] in Split.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=f00651e0-c138-47e7-b522-b7d77322d680&amp;articleId=e8c9646d-fdfe-4b8d-b40b-9fa809b36aa1 Dežulović Boris - Bačvice, God's Fingerprint, Phantom of Freedom (1-2/2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first played in 1908 by a group of Croatian students from [[Prague]] who were finding it difficult to play the game of [[water polo]] in the shallow water.&lt;ref name="picigin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatia-expert.com/about-us/picigin/ |title=Picigin Bacvice beach in Split}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they began playing a different game which would come to be known as picigin. 

==Description==
The game involves several players in a circle batting around a small ball with their hands; the objective is to keep the ball in the air and out of the water for as long as possible. Players don't catch the ball, they bounce it around with the palm of the hand. As such, the game somewhat resembles net-less [[volleyball]], but is played with a much smaller ball, usually a peeled tennis ball. There is no set number of players, though five is usually average. Much running and diving is done in order to keep the ball from going in the shallow water. Picigin is considered a non-competitive sport: there are no opposing sides, no points, neither winners nor losers. It is generally viewed as a relaxing and fun game, and many take the opportunity to make extravagant leaps and acrobatic manoeuvrings to keep the ball in play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/split/features/807/splits-best-beach-game Split's best beach game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105012154/http://www.timeout.com/split/features/807/splits-best-beach-game |date=2012-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Rules===
Since picigin is an amateur sport, there are no strict or formal rules, but it is played according to tradition, with little variation, but the main goal is to keep ball in the air as long as possible.



====Players====
There are usually five players in the game. Two of them are called ''sidruni'' (sidro = anchor, they are called so because they do not move from their places) and the other three are runners (''trkači''). The groups are often mixed both by gender and age.

====Terrain====
Picigin must be played on a sandy beach in shallow water. The beach must be sandy because otherwise players could easily get hurt. It is best if the water is ankle-deep, because of mobility and also to soften falls, which are common because there's a lot of jumping around trying to reach the ball.

====Ball====
The traditional ball, called ''balun'' (otherwise a dialectal name for a ball, but this name is strictly used, especially by expert players) is actually a peeled onion, polished off a few millimeters. This kind of ball is best suited for bouncing. It is smooth and lighter than a normal tennis ball.

==Tradition==
The most traditional players believe it to be impossible to play picigin anywhere but on the sandy beach of Bačvice in [[Split (city)|Split]], which is considered the game's spiritual home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/split/features/807/splits-best-beach-game Split's best Beach game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105012154/http://www.timeout.com/split/features/807/splits-best-beach-game |date=2012-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Picigin is played on Bačvice year round and, often at night in the summer (reflectors can be used in the dark). There is also a long-standing tradition of playing picigin on [[New Year's Day]] regardless of weather conditions, when the sea temperature is rarely above 10&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]].

In June 2008, picigin was pronounced a [[Croatia]]n immaterial cultural good, for a period of three years, and it is planned to get a permanent protection after that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/split-odrzano-prvenstvo-u-piciginu-pobijedila-ekupa-suncanica.html An article in Croatian about picigin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Championships===
Since 2005, the Picigin World Championship in picigin (''Prvenstvo svita u piciginu'') is organized every year on Bačvice beach in Split.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Split/tabid/72/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/140520/Default.aspx Na Bačama održano sedmo Prvenstvo svita u piciginu] &lt;/ref&gt; Until 2008, players were given a task to do certain jumps, but from 2008, the winner is selected according to the artistic impression of a whole group.

In Herceg Novi, Winter Picigin tournament is included Mimosa Festival (organized in February).

"'''Piece by Piece'''" is a song by American singer [[Kelly Clarkson]] taken from her [[Piece by Piece (Kelly Clarkson album)|seventh studio album]] of the same name. She co-wrote the track with its producer [[Greg Kurstin]]. A midtempo pop song about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships, Clarkson promulgated "Piece by Piece" as a sequel to the song "[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]" (2004) but with a "happy ending". After a discussion with her sister about their family life, she introspectively co-wrote the song in a [[first-person narrative]] to her father, whose neglect of his family was used as a [[wiktionary:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] to her husband's unconditional love for her and their daughter, whom they both promised to never abandon.

"Piece by Piece" was first released as the second [[promotional single]] from ''Piece by Piece'' by [[RCA Records]] on February 24, 2015. Upon its release, the title track received praise from music critics, who commended its lyrical content as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson premiered the song in a live acoustic performance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' and has showcased it on the [[set list]] of the [[Piece by Piece Tour]]. A re-worked version of the track was released to American [[hot adult contemporary]] radio stations on November 9, 2015, as the third and final single from the album. On February 25, 2016, Clarkson performed "Piece by Piece" in a live presentation on the [[American Idol (season 15)|fifteenth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''. The successful commercial and critical response of her performance on the program led [[RCA Records|RCA]] to issue an "''Idol'' version" of the track on February 29, 2016.

The combined versions of "Piece by Piece" allowed the song to debut on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart at number eight, becoming Clarkson's eleventh top ten hit and tying itself with "[[Never Again (Kelly Clarkson song)|Never Again]]" (2007) as her highest debut on the chart. The track also attained the top position on three ''Billboard'' charts—primarily the ''Billboard'' [[Digital Songs]] chart, earning Clarkson her 100th ''Billboard'' number-one hit—a milestone in her musical career. Elsewhere, "Piece by Piece" became a top 40 hit in the music charts of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Scotland. Clarkson later performed a reprise of the ''Idol'' version on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' on March 3, 2016. The ''Idol'' version was nominated for [[Best Pop Solo Performance]] at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]].

== Composition ==
One of the five songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote "Piece by Piece" with frequent collaborator [[Greg Kurstin]], who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: &lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of the reasons why I wrote "Piece by Piece" was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I think a lot of people go through that.&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post 1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

}}

Lyrically, the song is a midtempo [[pop music|pop]] number about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Idolator 1" /&gt; The song starts with a woman's recollection of her father abandoning his family; by the chorus, she finds a new man in her life, whom she describes as someone who, "piece by piece", had restored her "faith that a man can be kind and a father could stay".&lt;ref name="USA Today 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spin 1" /&gt; Written in a [[first-person narrative]], Clarkson introspectively co-wrote the song to her father, whose abandonment of his family when she was six years old was utilized as a [[wiktionary:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] in contrast to her husband's unconditional love to her and their daughter, whom they had both promised in the song to never leave behind.&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AXS 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A.V. Club 1" /&gt;

Clarkson pegged "Piece by Piece" as a follow-up song to her 2004 track "[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]" and the album's "most personal" record, saying that "once you've worked through that and you find love and the kind of happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="USA Today 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="News.com.au 1" /&gt; She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families.&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="News.com.au 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glamour 1" /&gt; She remarked, "I was talking to my sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that!".&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post 1" /&gt; Clarkson also noted that how their husbands were so supportive and loving were in stark contrast to the cliché about people with "abandonment issues" dating "losers".&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post 1" /&gt; She also said that "Piece by Piece" is a positive song, despite its somber resonance, and that she's still grateful to her father for making her want to be much more present in her family.&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post 1" /&gt; Sonically, [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' compared it to the anthems recorded by [[U2]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times 1" /&gt; While Marissa Muller of [[CBS Radio]] described its sound as having a stadium feel with big drums.&lt;ref name="Radio 1" /&gt;

== Release and reception ==
"Piece by Piece" was first issued as the album's second [[promotional recording|promotional single]] by [[RCA Records]] on February 24, 2015.&lt;ref name="Radio 1" /&gt; Clarkson also revealed plans for the song to receive a single release.&lt;ref name="Official Charts Company 1" /&gt; RCA then commissioned a re-worked version of the track for commercial release, which was serviced to [[hot adult contemporary]] radio stations on November 9, 2015 as the third single from the album.&lt;ref name="Single – Piece By Piece 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hot AC adds"/&gt; Following Clarkson's performance on ''[[American Idol]]'', RCA issued an ''Idol'' version accompanied by a piano by [[Jason Halbert]] and produced and mixed by [[Jason Halbert]] on February 29, 2016.&lt;ref name="Single – Piece By Piece 4" /&gt;

=== Critical response ===
"Piece by Piece" received acclaim from music critics, who promulgated it as one of the album's highlights for its lyrical content. Reviewing for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Jamieson Cox regarded the song as a raw and standout vocal showcase, saying that when Clarkson forges a real emotional connection with the track, it allows the album to transcend hammier and hackneyed moments in between.&lt;ref name="Billboard 2" /&gt; In his review for ''The New York Times'', Pareles described it as the album's most accusatory song; and noted that despite the lyrical's vulnerability, its music rises quickly to bombast, triumphal and glamorous but remote.&lt;ref name="The New York Times 1" /&gt; He also lamented that those moments are far too few in the album.&lt;ref name="The New York Times 1" /&gt; Writing for [[AXS (ticket merchant)|AXS]] on its release, Chase Hunt singled out "Piece by Piece" as the one that feels more natural than the rest of the album's tracks. He wrote, "Songs penned by [Clarkson], or any artist writing their own songs, feels different. The track is letting fans into her soul while telling more of her story, past and present."&lt;ref name="AXS 1" /&gt;

Katherine St. Asaph of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' also highlighted the song as one of the album's stronger moments, describing it as a dagger to deadbeat dads everywhere that marks her most pointed lyrics since ''[[Stronger (Kelly Clarkson album)|Stronger]]''{{'}}s "You Love Me" (2011).&lt;ref name="Time 1" /&gt; [[AllMusic]]'s senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] also included it as one of the three tracks (along with "[[Nostalgic (song)|Nostalgic]]" and "[[Good Goes the Bye]]") that strike a right balance of Clarkson's indomitable character and fresh electronic beats on the album's production.&lt;ref name="All Music 1" /&gt; In their reviews of ''Piece by Piece'', ''[[New York Post]]''{{'}}s Hardeep Phull also pegged the track as the album's emotional peak, while Jim Farber of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' highlighted the song as one of the two (along with "[[Someone (Kelly Clarkson song)|Someone]]") that show Clarkson's flair for the passive aggressive put-down and help focus on her persona.&lt;ref name="New York Post 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Daily News 1" /&gt; Reviewing of the album for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Annie Zaleski also commended the track as one of the tracks where Clarkson is far more engaging, and recommended that the album could use more of those emotional complexity and personal connection.&lt;ref name="A.V. Club 1" /&gt;

Clarkson presented "Piece by Piece" in a short live acoustic performance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' on March 2, 2015, and explained how she co-wrote the song.&lt;ref name="NBC 1" /&gt; She revealed that the song's lyrical content had also made it hard for her to perform it live, saying "It's not even the sad parts of it because I'm not there. I'm not in that place anymore, like where I'm sad about it. I'm in a very forgiving place about it and everybody's human. But I think I get really choked up because I just realize how lucky I am... And a lot of girls that grew up with their daddy issues and with not having that figure in their life, you know, take a very different road, and I just feel lucky that I'm not that girl." To promote the album, Clarkson had also performed the song in a stripped-down performance as part of her [[set list]] during her [[Piece by Piece Tour]].&lt;ref name="Billboard 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Las Vegas Sun 1" /&gt; On February 25, 2016, she performed "Piece by Piece" in a live performance a year after its release on the [[American Idol (season 15)|fifteenth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''.&lt;ref name="Vulture 1" /&gt; Her rendition of the song was met with a standing ovation from the audience&lt;ref name="USA Today 2" /&gt; and critical acclaim from music critics&lt;ref name="Metro 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jezebel 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheWrap 1" /&gt;— with Olivia Waring ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' praising it as poignant while ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Erin Jensen describing it as a "heartfelt performance that we just can't get enough of".&lt;ref name="USA Today 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro 1" /&gt; On March 3, 2016, Clarkson appeared on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' where she discussed her ''American Idol'' performance and closed the program with a rendition of the song.&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly 2" /&gt;

== Music video ==
An accompanying music video filmed by [[Alon Isocianu]] was commissioned to promote the single and premiered on [[Vevo]] on November 19, 2015.&lt;ref name="Women's Wear Daily 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News Radio 1" /&gt; The video, filmed entirely in a monochromatic form, features tribute scenes to women of all ages—primarily to mothers, abandoned daughters, and pregnant women, ending with a scene of Clarkson carrying her own daughter.&lt;ref name="Bustle 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Today Show 1" /&gt;

[[Image:Na Rejdišti str, Prague Old Town.jpg|thumb|Main building of the Prague Conservatory]]

The '''Prague Conservatory''' or '''Prague Conservatoire''' ({{lang-cs|Pražská konzervatoř}}) is a music school in [[Prague]], Czech Republic, founded in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Čeští houslisté tří století|first=František|last=Žídek|publisher=Panton|location=Prague|year=1982|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Prague Conservatory offers four or six year study courses, which can be compared to the level of [[high school]] diploma in other countries. Graduates of Prague Conservatory can continue their training by enrolling in an institution that offers [[undergraduate education]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.prgcons.cz/zakladniinformace&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Prague Conservatory was founded in 1808 by local aristocrats and burghers. Classes started in 1811, after a delay caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. [[Bedřich Diviš Weber]] was appointed the first director of the school.

In 1891, [[Antonín Dvořák]] joined the faculty as the head of the composition department. He was the school's director between 1901 and 1904. Dvořák's students included the composers [[Vítězslav Novák]], [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]] (who later served as director of the Conservatory), [[Rudolf Friml]], [[Oskar Nedbal]], and [[Franz Lehár]]. Another director of the school was pianist [[Vilém Kurz]].

Following the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1918, drama and ballet departments were established. Students in this period included [[Lída Baarová]] (dropped out), [[Jiří Langmajer]], [[Tatiana Vilhelmová]] (dropped out), [[Filip Blažek]], and [[Zuzana Vejvodová]]. Katya Zvelebilova began [[classical ballet]] training at the Prague Conservatory before joining the [[Royal Ballet School]] in [[London]], where she is now a member of the artistic staff, having retired from professional ballet.

== Instruction ==
Applicants must pass stringent entrance examinations, often held in several elimination rounds, to demonstrate their talent. Applications are accepted once a year (with a deadline usually at the end of November), and auditions take place at the end of January. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.prgcons.cz/zkousky&lt;/ref&gt;

Prague Conservatory offers instruction in several [[Musical instrument|instruments]], including [[accordion]], [[guitar]], [[piano]], and [[Organ (music)|organ]], as well as in [[singing]], [[composer|composing]], [[conducting]], and [[acting]]. The curriculum includes one-on-one music lessons, music theory studies, language training, as well as classes on general subjects. The institution has its own symphonic and chamber orchestras, choir, several chamber music ensembles and a theatre company. About 250 concerts and 40 dramatic performances take place annually.

In the academic year of 2005/2006, approximately 550 Czech and 40 foreign students studied at the Conservatory.

[[Sex trafficking]] is a problem in [[Oman]].&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

==Legal situation==
Only sex within a legalized marriage is permitted. Women's sex outside legal marriage is  criminalised as ''[[zina]]'' ([[illegal sex]], [[adultery]], [[fornication]]). It is women, and not their clients, who are legally penalised for sex work which carries a jail sentence between three and five years.&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al Shaibany|first1=Saleh|title=Oman cracks down on prostitution in an attempt to 'clear streets'|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/oman-cracks-down-on-prostitution-in-an-attempt-to-clear-streets-1.622226|website=The National|accessdate=28 January 2018|language=en|date=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living on the proceeds of prostitution is a crime, punishable by a fine and up to three months imprisonment (criminal code article 221).&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oman Royal Police Handbook|date=20 March 2009|publisher=Intl Business Pubns USA|isbn=978-1438736907|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt; Additionally, any foreigner who commits an act against "public order or good morals" or who does not have a legal source of income may be deported (law 16 of 1995, articles 31[1] and 31[5]).&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt;

Police crackdowns are frequent. 43 women were arrested in raids in Bausher in December 2016 and over 100 in simultaneous raids in Al Khuwayr in August 2017.&lt;ref name="dailynews"&gt;{{cite web|title=ROP arrests over 100 women for prostitution in Al Khuwayr - Oman|url=http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Oman/ROP-arrests-over-100-women-for-prostitution-in-Al-Khuwayr-52vw|website=Muscat Daily News|accessdate=28 January 2018|language=en|date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of [[Southeast Asia]]n women have been arrested for prostitution, and in November 2016 the issuing of tourist visas to women from Southeast Asia was restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oman tightens tourist visa rules to curb prostitution|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/oman/oman-tightens-tourist-visa-rules-to-curb-prostitution-1.1930586|work=Gulf News|date=30 November 2016|author= Fahad Al Mukrashi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3 years prior to August 2017, 273 people were arrested for prostitution and all received a minimum of 3 years jail sentence.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Oman}}
Oman is a destination and transit country for women, primarily from South and [[East Asia]] and [[East Africa|East]] and North Africa, subjected to sex trafficking, often by nationals of their own countries. There have been anecdotal reports that female domestic workers from countries without a diplomatic presence in Oman are especially vulnerable to sex trafficking. Domestic workers who flee their employers are also vulnerable to forced prostitution.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oman 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271257.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=28 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s and early 2000s, young women were trafficked from the former [[Soviet Union]] for sex work. In 2005 Oman ratified the [[International Labour Organization]]'s 1959 convention prohibiting forced labour. By that time foreign migrant workers made up 60% of Oman's population, and their standard of living was lower than the Omani average (Oman is classified as "medium human development" by the [[United Nations Development Programme]]).&lt;ref name="ency"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work|volume=1|author=Melissa Hope Ditmore|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=9780313329692|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SKBvqXL0jTQC|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oman has a serious problem of [[Human trafficking|people trafficking]] involving women and is considered a "[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]" country by the [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]].&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Oman 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282724.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RPH Australia''' is the national peak representative organisation for a unique Australian network of  [[radio reading service]] designed to meet the daily information needs of people who, for any reason, are unable to access normal printed material. It is conservatively estimated that 18.4% of the Australian population has a [[print disability]] (over 3.8 million).

Historically RPH stood for "Radio for the Print Handicapped" and they began in Australia in 1975 on Melbourne's [[3ZZ]].

On 23 July 1978 the [[Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Australia)|Minister for Post and Telecommunications]] announced: "The establishment of a special radio communications service for the blind and other people with reading difficulties." 

The federal government began its direct funding of the service with a $250,000 grant in the 1981/82 budget.

Initially using marine band (today's [[extended AM broadcast band]]) frequencies, stations in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney began operating. 7RPH Hobart went to air in June 1982.  3RPH Melbourne was officially opened in December the same year.

By 1984/85 RPH services were also operating in Brisbane and Canberra. After another review, the specialised stations of the service transferred to normal broadcast band frequencies in 1990 and 1991. 

Material from the network is heard on a small number of non-network community stations in Australia and on the [[Radio Reading Service]] of New Zealand.

In December 2013, all RPH Australia network stations joined the new [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] satellite platform.

'''Religious views on pornography''' are based on broader religious views on [[modesty]], human [[dignity]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and other virtues which may reflect negatively on [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sherkat and Ellison|date=1997|jstor=2580526|title=The Cognitive Structure of a Moral Crusade|publisher=''Social Forces''|page=958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different religious groups view pornography and sexuality differently.

People who identify themselves as very religious and consume porn are more likely to consider themselves as [[porn addiction|addicted to porn]] (an addiction that is not recognized in the psychiatric handbook [[DSM-V]]) than a non-religious reference group according to a 2013 study, but no connection between level of religious devotion and amount of porn consumed was shown in that study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/43362-religious-perceived-porn-addiction.html|title=Religious People More Likely to Think They're Addicted to Porn|website=Livescience.com|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical scholarship===
{{See also|Biblical law in Christianity|Religious views on masturbation}}

There is no direct prohibition of pornography in the Bible. However, many Christians base their views on pornography on [[Matthew 5:27–28]] (part of the [[Expounding of the Law]]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, [[Thou shalt not commit adultery]]: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to [[lust]] after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;J. Gordon Melton (1989), ''The Churches Speak on Pornography: Official Statements from Religious Bodies and Ecumenical Organizations'', Gale Research, p. xxi-xxii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur J. Mielke (1995), ''Christians, Feminists, and the Culture of Pornography'', University Press of America, p. 57-58,62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawler"&gt;Ronald David Lawler, Joseph M. Boyle, William E. May (1998), ''Catholic Sexual Ethics: A Summary, Explanation &amp; Defense'', Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;Larry J. Nelson, Laura M. Padilla-Walker, Jason S. Carroll (2010). Ralph L. Piedmont, ed. ""I Believe It Is Wrong But I Still Do It": A Comparison of Religious Young Men Who Do Versus Do Not Use Pornography". ''Psychology of Religion and Spirituality''. American Psychological Association. Vol 2 (3), p. 137. DOI 10.1037/a0019127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It contains one of the [[Ten Commandments]], Exodus 20:14 or Deuteronomy 5:18, which is also used often as a supporting verse to condemn pornography.&lt;ref name="Melton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Cebulko (2007), ''The Impact of Internet Pornography on Married Women: A Psychodynamic Perspective'', Cambria Press, p. 43, {{ISBN|1-9340-4317-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Coogan]] reports that, based on his past experience, the campaign against lustful thoughts had the consequence of [[Book censorship|razoring the Song of Songs from the Bibles]] available for seminarians.&lt;ref name=silver/&gt;

[[Ken Stone (biblical scholar)|Ken Stone]] cites [[Origen]]'s words to say that reading the Song of Songs may stimulate lust to 'fleshly' readers: "But if any man who lives only after the flesh shall approach [the Song of Songs], to such a one the reading of this Scripture will be the occasion of no small hazard and danger. For he, not knowing how to hear love's language in purity and with chaste ears, will twist the whole manner of his hearing of it away from the inner spiritual man and on to the outward and carnal; and he will be turned away from the spirit to the flesh, and will foster carnal desires in himself, and it will seem to be the Divine Scriptures that are thus urging and egging him on to fleshly lust!" Stone adds that "the heavy use of food imagery in the book is no barrier to a positive 'pornographic' interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Ken Stone (2005), ''Practicing Safer Texts: Food, Sex and Bible in Queer Perspective'', A&amp;C Black, p. 107, {{ISBN|0-567-08172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Hess]] explains Carey E. Walsh's view as: "Walsh has determined that the emphasis of the Song lies in the expression of desire between two lovers. It is not sexual consummation that is most important, but the desire itself that drives the lovers together. In this she distinguishes [[erotica]] from pornography. The latter is concerned only with sex, and in this it is qualitatively different from the Song. Here sex plays a secondary role to desire. Whether there is any sexual activity at all in the poem—and as a fantasy there may be no such reality here—the key to the Song remains with the desire that drives the reader to appreciate the time of waiting. Hebrew experience placed the greatest value on passion."&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Hess (2005), ''Song of Songs'', Baker Academic, p. 32, {{ISBN|0-8010-2712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saying that the Song of Songs is "erotica", not pornography, she argues that both are different in at least three ways: (1) Erotica inclines toward "emotions and internal worlds" of a subject to seek empathy, while pornography's "emotional flatness" aims at sexual gratification; (2) Erotica focuses on yearning to reach "consummation", which may occur in "tortuous delay", while pornography is only about the "acts" to reach it as soon as possible and "a frenzy of repetition"; (3) Erotica uses imagination as the "invisible and ever-active participant" without revealing the "mystery of love", while pornography is no more than an explicit story of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Carey Ellen Walsh (2000), ''Exquisite Desire: Religion, the Erotic, and the Song of Songs'', Fortress Press, p. 42-45, {{ISBN|0-8006-3249-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

====Roman Catholicism====
The [[magisterium]] of the [[Catholic Church]] interprets Matthew 5:27–28 to mean that since the purpose of pornography is to create lust, it is sinful, because lusting is equivalent to [[adultery]]. As the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Pornography'' consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them deliberately to third parties. It offends against chastity because it perverts the conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave injury to the dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public), since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. It immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy world. It is a grave offense. Civil authorities should prevent the production and distribution of pornographic materials.&lt;ref&gt;CCC 2354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, before he became [[Pope John Paul II]], wrote in ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'': "Pornography is a marked tendency to accentuate the sexual element when reproducing the human body or human love in a work of art, with the object of inducing the reader or viewer to believe that sexual values are the only real values of the person, and that love is nothing more than the experience, individual or shared, of those values alone." Edward Sri explains about the topic of art and pornography, which is discussed in the book by contrasting [[Michelangelo]]'s works with ''[[Playboy]]'', by saying that "good art leads us to a peaceful contemplation of the true, the good and the beautiful, including the truth, goodness and beauty of the human body", while pornography "stirs in us a sensuous craving for the body of another person as an object to be exploited for our own pleasure" and, if it is left uncontrolled, "we will become enslaved to everything that stimulates our sensual desire".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sri (2007), ''Men, Women, and the Mystery of Love: Practical Insights from John Paul II's Love and Responsibility'', St. Anthony Messenger Press, {{ISBN|9780867168402}}, p. 29,119&lt;/ref&gt; When one constantly views pornography, which is focused merely on "the visible and the erotic", and reduces the human person to what is visible with the eyes, he or she will have difficulties relating to people of different gender in real life, since he or she would have become accustomed to seeing them as "objects to be used".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Percy (2005), ''Theology of the Body Made Simple'', Gracewing Publishing, {{ISBN|0852446683}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of lectures called the ''[[Theology of the Body]]'', Pope John Paul II argues that some works of art depict naked individuals without evoking lust, but "makes it possible to concentrate, in a way, on the whole truth of man, and the dignity and beauty—also the 'suprasensual' beauty—of his masculinity and feminity", and that such works "bear within them, almost hidden, an element of sublimation". He insists that pornography is problematic since "it fails to portray everything that is human".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher West (2003), ''Theology of the Body Explained: A Commentary on John Paul II's "Gospel of the Body"'', Gracewing Publishing, {{ISBN|0852446004}}, p. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestantism====
Harry Reid notes that, during the Reformation, "[[John Calvin|Calvin]]'s aim was straightforward, if ambitious; he wanted to create a perfect Christian community where everyone looked after everyone else... He persuaded the [[Grand Council of Geneva|council]] to legislate against adultery, prostitution, pornography, gambling, drunkenness and much else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=n50sAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=pornography+calvin+geneva&amp;dq=pornography+calvin+geneva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz5LDG3-LaAhXLebwKHXbRAaoQ6AEIUDAJ|title=Reformation: The Dangerous Birth of the Modern World|first=Harry|last=Reid|date=26 May 2018|publisher=Saint Andrew Press|accessdate=26 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Manetsch, the [[Genevan Consistory]] regularly censured literature they deemed dangerous for public morals, including pornography.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=q5g6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=pornography+calvin+geneva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz5LDG3-LaAhXLebwKHXbRAaoQuwUILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=pornography+calvin+geneva&amp;f=false|title=Calvin's Company of Pastors: Pastoral Care and the Emerging Reformed Church, 1536-1609|first=Scott M.|last=Manetsch|date=1 February 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=26 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oboler also notes that pornography was censored in Geneva and Puritan New England in order to defend against "ungodly eroticism".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Max Weber argued that there was a concern that eroticism was a kind of idolatry that went against God's rational regulation of sexuality through marriage alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xvaIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=reject+every+sophistication+of+the+erotic+idolatory+of+the+worst+kind&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KijYXHlKIS&amp;sig=2yWAN5ASfYTiEt39-xZNP6X_0oA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJs-_q4-LaAhVEybwKHU8KB50Q6AEwAnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=reject+every+sophistication+of+the+erotic+idolatory+of+the+worst+kind&amp;f=false|title=Capitalism and Modernity: An Excursus on Marx and Weber|first=Derek|last=Sayer|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=26 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin E. Marty notes that, today, both mainstream and evangelical Protestants remain overwhelmingly opposed to pornography and that you will find "very, very few theological statements that go light on pornography."&lt;ref name="uchicago.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/pornography-and-american-protestantism-martin-e-marty|title=Pornography and American Protestantism -- Martin E. Marty - The University of Chicago Divinity School|website=divinity.uchicago.edu|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Lutheranism=====
In 1990, the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]] condemned pornography by publishing an official position on "X-rated videos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lca.box.net/shared/static/zn5r2j0cx8nivrvahfiv.pdf|title=Lutheran Church of Australia : Commission on Social and Bioethical Questions : X-RATED VIDEOS|format=PDF|website=Lca.box.net|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor John Kleinig, Lecturer Emeritus at the [[Australian Lutheran College]], argues that, "The regular use of pornography for masturbation is a kind of sexual addiction. When Paul speaks about impurity and sexual greed as idolatry in Ephesians 5:3-7 and Colossians 3:5, he accurately describes how it works. It begins with sexual impurity, the defilement of our imagination by depictions of sexual intercourse that present naked bodies as idols for us to admire. Our fixation on these images arouses disordered desires and make us more and more greedy for sexual satisfaction from things that God has not given to us for our enjoyment. Yet they fail to satisfy us and serve only to feed our growing appetite for them...  Where masturbation is involved... the more ashamed we become, the more secretive we become; the more secretive we become and the more we hide in the darkness, the more vulnerable we become to the accusation and condemnation of Satan... You need to be careful that Satan does not distort your perception by making a fool of you and getting you to focus on the wrong thing. Nowhere in the Bible is masturbation explicitly forbidden. There is good reason for this because the problem does not come from masturbation, which is in itself neither good or bad, but the adulterous sexual fantasies that accompany it, as Christ makes clear in Matthew 5:28. That’s the problem spiritually! ... That’s how Satan gets a hold on us through our imagination. If you use pornography to masturbate, you put another woman, an idol that promises heaven and gives you hell, sexually, in the place of your wife. It arouses your greed for what you don’t have, greed for what God has not given for you to enjoy, greed that increases as you give in to it. The more you indulge it, the more dissatisfied and empty you become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.doxology.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/56_Pastoral-Letter-on-Porn-by-John-Kleinig.pdf|title=Pastoral Letter on Porn|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gottesdienstonline.blogspot.com.au/2011/03/sources-to-help-with-pornography.html|title="Pornography" Guest: Dr. John Kleinig, Lecturer Emeritus, Australian Lutheran College|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD) condemns pornography. The Church refuses to invest in any company producing pornography, stating that, "Human dignity is based on the belief that women and men are created in God's image. This results in the mission to protect this dignity against derogatory, denigrating, or degrading portrayals. The analysis of this criterion should not only consider pornographic products, but also the producers of videos depicting violence and likewise computer games glamourizing violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archiv.ekd.de/english/texts/ekdtext_113_guideline-ekdtext_113_appendix.html|title=Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland|first=|last=EKD-Internearbeit|date=28 April 2017|website=Archiv.ekd.de|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement on the role of the media, the EKD's 1997 synod stated, "According to the churches, public broadcasting plays a vital role in guaranteeing the freedom of opinion and access to a variety of information in Germany. Maintaining and strengthening this system, which is "almost unique" in the world, is "imperative", said Bishop Engelhardt... In view of its greater freedom in producing programmes, it has "a special obligation to practise voluntary control". Now that "violations of taboos and norms" are constantly increasing, public control and self-regulation of the media must be increased. This also applies to the protection of "religious convictions", said Bishop Lehmann. First attempts made by German Internet providers to introduce voluntary self-regulation need to be improved. Nothing glorifying violence, instigating racial hatred, violating human dignity, glorifying war or pornography must be available on-line..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirchegeld.de/1705-3333.html|title=Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland|first=|last=EKD-Internearbeit|date=28 April 2017|website=Kirchegeld.de|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EKD's 1997 synod also "spoke out for action against child pornography on the Internet. All legal methods must be applied to counteract it. Additionally, the German government should pursue sharper criminal proceedings against people who traffic in women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirchegeld.de/english/1703-3360.html|title=Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland|first=|last=EKD-Internearbeit|date=28 April 2017|website=Kirchegeld.de|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of Sweden]] declared, "It is not permissible [for us] to invest in media companies that have a clear link to pornography."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=1393444]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Calvinism=====
The [[United Protestant Church of France]] (EPUdf) teaches that pornography is a sin. According to Pastor Gilles Boucomont, "The Bible does not talk about pornography. It says that sexuality is lived properly as part of a commitment, marriage. Outside of this context, sexuality is adultery if one is already married or [[fornication|sexual misconduct]] if one is not yet married. Misconduct and adultery break the unity that God wants for the married man and woman (1 Corinthians 6 and 7, Mark 10: 1-12)... Watching pornography is not doing a sexual act with anyone, certainly. However, Jesus considers that adultery begins in the eye (Matthew 5,28). There is also no need for a large dissertation to explain that viewing such films does not favor the formation or continuity of stable couples. The second aspect of our problem lies in our responsibility for the people who shoot such films. Jesus asks us to love our neighbor as ourselves. If we do not think we have to surrender our bodies for money, because that is not God's good will for the human, we can not support this practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://1001questions.fr/pourquoi-la-consommation-de-pornographie-est-elle-consideree-comme-un-peche-est-ce-que-le-porno-est-une-forme-de-prostitution-puisque-les-femmes-sont-payees-pour-poser-nue-faire-des-actes-sexuels/|title=Pourquoi la consommation de pornographie est-elle considérée comme un péché ? Est-ce que le porno est une forme de prostitution (puisque les femmes sont payées pour poser nue/faire des actes sexuels) ? [Terry]|date=23 March 2018|website=1001questions.fr|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masturbation is also considered sinful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://1001questions.fr/la-masturbation-est-elle-un-peche-moussa/|title=La masturbation est-elle un péché ? [Moussa]|date=3 November 2017|website=1001questions.fr|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the topic of non-sexual nudity, the EPUdf teaches, "Sin is what separates me from God or comes from my separation from Him. Therefore, nudity, whether sexual or not, must be considered in the context of relationships with God and others. Going to a mixed sauna ... if it's only with my partner, in my opinion, I do not see the problem... If it is with other people, it seems to me legitimate to ask questions about the temptation that can arise and the reasons that make me go. If there is already a habit of nudity in the civilization to which I belong, it may also not be of a nature to distract me from God. I think it's the same for the nude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://1001questions.fr/question-etrange-la-nudite-non-sexuelle-est-elle-un-peche-par-exemple-la-culture-mixte-de-sauna-nu-en-allemagne-scandinavie-quen-est-il-du-modele-posant-nu-pour-photo-non-porno-luxure-fr/|title=Question étrange : la nudité non sexuelle est-elle un péché?

[Fred]|date=13 February 2018|website=1001questions.fr|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Calvinist Protestant Church of Switzerland also condemns pornography. Pastor Jean-Charles Bichet writes, "Pornography... gives a distorted image of sexuality. It can cause more problems than it solves... And the sad thing about all this is that it gives the opportunity for a juicy trade . People who agree to pose for photos or to play X rated scenes have not all chosen to do so. By consuming porn, humans are also taking responsibility for this kind of trafficking. In this sense, we are sinners because we find ourselves involved in this general problem of society. The Bible does not specifically refer to pornography, but it often makes harsh judgments about the exploitation of people and prostitution. It reminds us that we are all created in the image of God, that we are little brothers and sisters of Jesus, the Son of God, live in liberated and happy people. The Bible constantly reminds us that none of us is a commodity. None of us should be treated like a shirt that is thrown away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://questiondieu.com/recherche-avancee/details/2/2102-la-pornographie-un-peche.html#.WuYTKTauaf0|title=Questions La pornographie, un péché ?  - questiondieu.com|website=questiondieu.com|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the liberal [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] produced a report entitled, ''Pornography: Far from the Song of Songs'', which states, "Through words and images, pornography debases God’s intended gifts of love and dignity in human sexuality... we live in an age also marked by the shattering of many norms of behavior and the subsequent loss of moral restraints. In such a time pornography has proliferated. The task force believes that the church is called to give serious attention to this issue... Reflected in the title of this report is the conviction that pornography represents human discord, far from the mutual sexual delight depicted biblically in the Song of Songs. Pornography is a striking sign of human brokenness and alienation from God and from one another... From the perspective of biblical understanding and the Reformed tradition, pornography represents a vivid expression of human alienation: from the creator God who makes covenants and from one another as covenant partners of God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130816011516/http://www.pcusa.org/get/resources/resource/11636/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its church magazine, the [[Presbyterian Church in Canada]] argues against pornography on the grounds that it is addictive, it alters the brain, that pornographers are trying to normalize the industry and that it can distract Christians who are trying to perform nightly devotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presbyterianrecord.ca/2015/07/31/pornography/|title=Pornography (Don't read this if you want to stay in the dark) - Presbyterian Record|date=31 July 2015|website=Presbyterianrecord.ca|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Methodism=====
The [[United Methodist Church]] teaches that pornography is "about violence, degradation, exploitation, and coercion" and "deplore[s] all forms of commercialization, abuse, and exploitation of sex", and defines pornography as "sexually explicit material that portrays violence, abuse, coercion, domination, humiliation, or degradation for the purpose of arousal. In addition, any sexually explicit material that depicts children is pornographic"."&lt;ref name="UMC—Book of Resolutions"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.umsexualethics.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=7JsVYoceN8w%3d&amp;tabid=7547| title = 2081. Pornography and Sexual Violence|publisher = [[United Methodist Church]]|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sexual Ethics Task Force of The United Methodist Church'' states that "Research shows it [pornography] is not an 'innocent activity.' It is harmful and is generally addictive. Persons who are addicted to pornography are physiologically altered, as is their perspective, relationships with parishioners and family, and their perceptions of girls and women."&lt;ref name="UMC—Pornography"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.umsexualethics.org/AccusedConfused/Whatswrongwithpornography.aspx|title = What's Wrong with Pornography?|publisher = [[United Methodist Church]]|accessdate = 2007-06-24|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100429232856/http://www.umsexualethics.org/AccusedConfused/Whatswrongwithpornography.aspx|archivedate = 29 April 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liberal-leaning [[Uniting Church of Australia]] also condemns pornography and works in society to address the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/national/perils-of-porn-under-the-microscope/news-story/20840eead897f62f5950294de1db6a71?from=public_rss | title=Church fears growing porn addictions | date=20 August 2012 | first=Adam | last=Hegarty | publisher=news.com.au | accessdate=13 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Quakers=====
In 1990, Quakers declared, "Since pornographic materials promote and propagate a lifestyle that includes activities which are condemned by God's Word and tempt viewers to commit the sin of lust (Matthew 5:27-28: Romans 13:14; II Peter 2:14, 18-19), Friends therefore are urged to carefully avoid exposure to such materials. Because of our responsibility as Christian citizens (Matthew 5:13; Proverbs 14:34) and in view of the evil, exploitative, and destructive effects of pornography on individuals, families, and our society, Friends are encouraged to prayerfully and boldly oppose the production and distribution of pornographic materials in their local communities, as well as at the state and national levels (Ephesians 5:11)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quaker.org/legacy/sexuality/FPExcerpts.htm|title=Quakers Integrating Spirituality and Sexuality|website=quaker.org|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mennonites=====
Mennonites believe pornography is sinful. In a major report, the Mennonite Central Committee notes, "One misconception is that adult pornography has no victims: it’s a harmless, pleasurable activity which damages no one. Yet, research and experience increasingly show that pornography does cause harm: to one’s relationship with God, to human relationships, to the user, to those in the industry and to society in general." The report goes on to elaborate how it causes this harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mcc.org/sites/mcc.org/files/media/common/documents/pornographybooklet13web.pdf|format=PDF|title=Pornography : Lies, Truth and Hope|website=Mcc.org|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Evangelicalism=====
In 2002, researcher Martin E. Marty noted that, "... most of the anti-porn activity is indeed from fundamentalist and evangelical groups... What keeps [American] mainstream Protestants from being consistently up front on an issue that... quite possibly leads to rape and other crimes, demeans the "user," and benefits the billions-per-year exploiter, has little to do with pornography. Instead it connects with their heavy commitment to free speech, their fear lest countering pornography in communications might erode the defenses against intrusions on precious liberties. Such Protestants are slow to promote boycotts and extremely cautious about legislation in areas so necessarily ill-defined as pornography. Caught between their abhorrence of pornography and their passion for liberties and rights, mainline Protestants, most Catholics, Reform Jews, and others have not found effective ways to be up front on this important front."&lt;ref name="uchicago.edu"/&gt;

Two other American researchers, Sherkat and Ellison, produced a study which shows, "that Conservative Protestant opposition to pornography is rooted in commitments to Biblical inerrancy and solidified by high rates of religious participation. Inerrancy serves as a cognitive resource informing two separate paths to pornography opposition: moral absolutism and beliefs in the threat of social contamination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2580526|title=The Cognitive Structure of a Moral Crusade: Conservative Protestantism and Opposition to Pornography|first1=Darren E.|last1=Sherkat|first2=Christopher G.|last2=Ellison|date=26 May 1997|journal=Social Forces|volume=75|issue=3|pages=957–980|doi=10.2307/2580526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Falwell]] has criticized pornography, saying sex is reserved for heterosexual married couples, to be used only in accordance with [[Will of God|God's will]] (more specifically, to both solidify the emotional bonds between the man and his lawfully wedded wife, and to help propagate the human race ("Be fruitful, and multiply.")), and asserts that use of pornography involves indulgence in [[lust]] towards people other than one's spouse (which in [[Christianity]] is a [[sin]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=5&amp;verse=27&amp;end_verse=29&amp;version=31&amp;context=context |title=Matthew 5:27-29 NIV - Adultery - "You have heard that it |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leads to an overall increase in sexually immoral behavior (including, for example, [[adultery]], [[rape]], and/or even [[child molestation]]).

William M. Struthers in his book, ''Wired for Intimacy'', has criticized pornography from a scientific viewpoint, suggesting that the viewing and use of pornography embeds abnormal neural pathways in the brain such that the desire for physical sexual relations may become subverted over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YX0GSM?btkr=1 |title=Wired for Intimacy: How Pornography Hijacks the Male Brain - Kindle edition by William M.

====Anglicanism====
The 1998 Lambeth Conference Resolution I.10 states, "... Clearly some expressions of sexuality are inherently contrary to the Christian way and are sinful. Such unacceptable expression of sexuality include promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual), adultery, violence against wives, and female circumcision. From a Christian perspective these forms of sexual expression remain sinful in any context. We are particularly concerned about the pressures on young people to engage in sexual activity at an early age, and we urge our Churches to teach the virtue of abstinence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/resources/document-library/lambeth-conference/1998/section-i-called-to-full-humanity/section-i10-human-sexuality?author=Lambeth+Conference&amp;year=1998|title=Section I.10 - Human Sexuality|website=Anglicancommunion.org|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglican Diocese of Melbourne]] published an article which noted that, "Pornography is prostitution, as men pay money, time and dignity for gratification. This payment might not be direct, but the support of pornography feeds the human trafficking industry, in which some 27 million women and children are trapped worldwide. The harlot that used to be on the street corner is now our computer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourneanglican.org.au/NewsAndViews/TMA/Pages/2011/2011-12/Porn-how-you-need-to-see-it-001178.aspx|title=Porn: how you need to see it|website=Melbourneanglican.org.au|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]] has established an "Archbishop's Taskforce for Resisting Pornography", which at the end of 2017, was seeking to establish a "resistingporn.org" website. The taskforce chairman has noted, "We know porn can alter desires and can affect self-control and compulsive behaviours. Studies have shown that the brains of long-term porn users behave similarly to those of drug addicts. There are also other effects... such as increasing incidences of adultery and earlier first-time sexual activity. It also goes without saying pornography is incompatible with God’s good purposes for the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sydneyanglicans.net/news/purposefully-porn-free|title=Purposefully porn-free|website=Sydneyanglicans.net|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other sects====
=====Mormonism=====
[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) from 1995 to 2008, was known within the faith for expounding his organization's sentiments against pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinckley|first=Gordon B.|title=A Tragic Evil among Us|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2004/10/a-tragic-evil-among-us?lang=eng|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|date=2 October 2004|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The LDS Church teaches that pornography is "any material depicting or describing the human body or sexual conduct in a way that arouses sexual feelings. It is as harmful to the spirit as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs are to the body. Members of the Church should avoid pornography in any form and should oppose its production, distribution, and use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overcoming Pornography &amp;#124; How to Stop a Porn Addiction and Get Help|url=https://overcomingpornography.org/?lang=eng|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|date=23 October 2015|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
Pornography is directly opposed to the very heart of Islamic teachings, which is highlighted by [[Taqwa]] to gain a better self-control. The Shariah and the basic Islamic ethical principles emphasize the guarding of one's private parts, instructs lowering of gazes &amp; recommends maintaining of modesty. These teachings fundamentally apply equally to looking at private parts in pictures or films, it is so to increase spiritual awareness and taqwa and prepare the soul to taste the sweetness of Imaan (Utter Belief in the commandments of Allah).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

That opposition between this "porn-use" attitude with the "[[fitra]]" (reverence instinct toward Allah, that all humans have, whether they are aware of it or not), creates a state of tension that leads to the destruction of the soul, leading to sadness and depression, and loss of self-esteem. That is why, in Islam, pornography is seen as a fundamentally destructive force to eradicate from one's life and from society.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In the famous 151st verse of the chapter named An'am, among the five chief commandments, in the fourth one Allah says, "and do not even draw to things shameful - be they open or secret."

The Qur'an 24:30 states, "Tell the acknowledging men to lower their gaze and guard their private parts, for that is purer for them. God is fully aware of what you do."&lt;ref&gt;Edip-Layth (Quran: A Reformist Translation)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an 24:31 states "And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and keep covered their private parts, and that they should not show-off their beauty except what is apparent, and let them cast their shawls over their cleavage. And let them not show off their beauty except to their husbands... "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Quran/24?oldid=506079 |title=Quran (Progressive Muslims Organization)/24 - Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date=2007-11-18 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, it is stated by Islamic scholars that one can only look lustfully at the [[nakedness]] or the body of someone who is one's spouse, and if a Muslim sees someone or something that arouses them, including pornography, they should avoid looking at it. Hence, the justification for declaring pornography [[haram]] in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/42165 |title=Islam Question &amp; Answer |publisher=islamqa.info |accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimislam.com/effects-of-pornography-in-marriage/ |title=Ahlul Bayt Islamic Mission |publisher=aimislam.com |accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an says what means "They are your garments and you are their garments." (2:187) "The sexual unison between husband and wife is more than seeking a relief from the urge of desire. Indeed the prophet taught that it is one of the charities in Islam. He said to his companions, enumerating examples of charitable deeds :'And when the one of you makes love (has sex with wife/husband) it is a rewardable charity.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/ethics.html |title=Sexual Ethics |publisher=Islamawareness.net |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{see also|Technology Awareness Group|Atzat Nefesh|Judaism and sexuality#Sexual fantasy and pornography}}
[[Michael Coogan]] stated that the [[Tanakh]] does not have any specific laws relating to pornography and Judaism has always had a positive attitude to sex.&lt;ref name=silver&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2027582,00.html |title=Q&amp;A: 'God and Sex' Author Michael Coogan on the Bible |publisher=TIME |date=2010-10-31 |accessdate=2015-02-21|quote=In many passages it's a highly erotic text, and it was a text that rabbinic literature tells us used to be sung in taverns. Yet when I was in seminary many decades ago, it was razored out of many of the Bibles that we had.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some commentators note, the Bible itself contains [[erotica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-bible-really-says-about-sex-68665|last=Miller|first=Lisa|title=What the Bible Really Says About Sex |publisher=Newsweek.com|date=2011-02-06|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kohn&gt;Rachael Kohn [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/spiritofthings/the-worlds-sexiest-book/3689312 "The World's Sexiest Book"]. The Spirit of Things. ABC Radio National, 15 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Song of Songs]].&lt;ref name=silver/&gt;

[[Maimonides]], in his [[Mishneh Torah]], writes, based on the [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;Shabbat 64b&lt;/ref&gt; that "A person who stares at even a small finger of a woman with the intent of deriving pleasure is considered as if he looked at her genitalia. It is even forbidden to hear the voice of a woman with whom sexual relations are prohibited, or to look at her hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mishneh Torah|page=21:2|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960669/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Twenty-One.htm|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further codified in the [[Shulchan Aruch|Code of Jewish Law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shulchan Arukh|page=21:1|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Even_HaEzer.21.1?lang=bi|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes further prohibitions (based on the Talmud) such as "watching women as they do the laundry." Accordingly, pornography would be forbidden a fortiori.

Additionally, Jewish laws of modesty and humility (''[[tzniut]]'') require Jewish women to dress modestly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janowski|first1=Malkie|title=Who Decides What Is Modest?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1248044/jewish/Who-Decides-What-Is-Modest.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish law thus precludes Jewish women from engaging in pornographic modelling or acting, besides other acts of immodesty.

The issue is also, according to [[Chabad.org]], one of personal control over one's urges, which pornography, it is asserted, takes away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Tzvi|title=What's Wrong With Pornography?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/658901/jewish/Whats-Wrong-with-Pornography.htm|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
Although there is no direct prohibition of pornography in Sikhism, Sikhs argue that pornographic books and films, prostitution and lust leads to adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnICyg09IEIC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=sikhism+and+pornography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hg6uruvmdv&amp;sig=bhQWI7pM2DpsY4W2cJ4wLRvtOgE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k-pISufHDp6QjAeDrtBi&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 |title=Moral issues in six religions - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography is said to encourage lust ([[Kaam]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhwomen.com/Guru_Quotes/Guru_on_sexuality_lust.htm |title=Guru Granth Sahib Quotes on Sex, Lust, Promicuity, Attachement (Sikhism) |publisher=Sikhwomen.com |date=2006-02-03 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a concept described as an unhealthy obsession for sex and sexual activity. Kaam is classed as one of the '[[Five Thieves]]', personality traits which are heavily discouraged for Sikhs, as they "can build barriers against God in their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml |title=Religions - Sikhism: Sikh Beliefs |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography is not explicitly discouraged in Sikhism however; only lustfulness is. In Sikh belief pornography would only be tantamount to a sin if it becomes a flaw in one's spiritual nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10309">A '''rock musical''' is a [[musical theatre]] work with [[rock music]]. The genre of rock musical may overlap somewhat with [[album musical]]s, [[concept album]]s and [[song cycle]]s, as they sometimes tell a story through the rock music, and some album musicals and concept albums become rock musicals. Notable examples of rock musicals include ''[[Next to Normal]]'', ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', and ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. [[The Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' and other [[rock opera]]s are sometimes presented on stage as a musical.

==History==
The rock musical became an important part of the musical theatre scene in the late 1960s with the hit show ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. Styled "The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical," the anti-war free-love [[hippie]]-themed, nude-scened ''Hair'' premiered in 1967 as the first production staged at [[The Public Theater]]. It moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in October 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/1960bway3.htm "History of the Musical Stage 1960s: III – Rock: 'The Age of Aquarius'"], Musicals101, accessed May 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Your Own Thing]]'' also opened in 1968 and featured a gender-switching version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Twelfth Night]]''. However, the first musical to hint at what was to come had been the final edition of the [[Ziegfeld Follies]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Wollman, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; This production featured one [[rock and roll]] number, "The Juvenile Delinquent". The song was performed by fifty-year-old [[Billy De Wolfe]]. This was followed by another precursor to the rock musical, ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (1960)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann-Margret]], who starred in the movie version of ''Bye Bye Birdie'', later starred in the movie version of ''Tommy''&lt;/ref&gt; Although rock and roll would have to wait for seven more years before returning to Broadway, these early, tentative infusions of rock into musical theatre paved the way for ''Hair'' and its progeny.&lt;ref&gt;Everett, William A. and Paul R. Laird, ''The Cambridge Companion to the Musical'' (2002) Cambridge University Press, pp. 231-33 {{ISBN|0-521-79639-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', composed by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]], began as an [[album musical]] in 1970. The money made from album sales was used to fund the subsequent stage production in late 1971.&lt;ref name="Kenrick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicals101.com/1970bway1.htm|title=The 1970s: Part I-Rock Musicals|last=Kenrick|first=John|work=History of The Musical Stage|publisher=Musicals 101|accessdate=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This show and some other rock musicals that have no dialogue or are otherwise reminiscent of opera, with dramatic, emotional themes, are sometimes styled "[[rock opera]]s". The musical ''[[Godspell]]'' (1971), had similar religious themes (albeit with a less controversial treatment) and pop/rock influences.&lt;ref name="Kenrick"/&gt; The genre continued to develop through the 1970s with shows such as ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''&lt;ref name="Kenrick"/&gt; and ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[''Pippin''] is a commonplace set to rock music": Barnes, Clive. ''The New York Times'', October 24, 1972, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The rock musical soon moved in other directions with shows like ''[[The Wiz]]'', ''[[Raisin (musical)|Raisin]]'', ''[[Dreamgirls]]'' and ''[[Purlie]]'', which were heavily influenced by [[R&amp;B]] and [[soul music]].

The rock musical saw a decline in popularity through the 1980s. Except for a few outposts of rock, like ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' (1982) and ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' (1986), audience tastes turned to shows with European pop scores, like ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', as well as to more nostalgic fare. However, the rock musical achieved a renaissance in the 1990s, due in no small part to the popularity of [[Jonathan Larson]]'s rock musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996). This was followed by [[Off-Broadway]] rock musicals like ''[[Bat Boy: The Musical]]'' (1997)&lt;ref&gt;"O'Keefe's peppy and melodic pop-rock score is played by a five piece combo": Sommer, Elyse.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/theater/theaterspecial/16rock.html?ref=theaterspecial "Broadway Rocks. Get Over It"]. ''The New York Times'', May 12, 2010, accessed June 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock musical has seen a resurgence in the late 1990s and the 2000s, with shows by composers like [[Elton John]] (''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'', 1998), as well as a number of successful [[jukebox musical]]s with rock scores. Recent major original rock musical productions include ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'' (2007), ''[[Passing Strange]]'' and ''[[Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson]]'' (both 2008), ''[[Rock of Ages (musical)|Rock of Ages]]'' and ''[[Next to Normal]]'' (both 2009), and ''[[American Idiot (musical)|American Idiot]]'' (2010).&lt;ref name=TimesAnalysis/&gt;

==Analysis==
In 2010, critic [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out that all four of the musicals nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Musical]] that year could be described as rock musicals. He analyzed the history and future of rock on Broadway:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rock’s takeover of Broadway was not the revolution that had been feared – or anticipated – ever since ''Hair'' ... Broadway held out for many years as a bastion against youth culture. ... Rock’s Broadway invasion has been, instead, a lengthy campaign of attrition, via demographics, shifting tastes and musicians’ ambitions. Every few years another production [was] touted as finally bringing full-fledged rock to musical theater: ''Rent'', ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'' ... ''Spring Awakening''. Very gradually rock musicians have stopped treating Broadway as an adversary – or a punch line. And for fans it has become one more entertainment option, as prices for arena shows reach Broadway levels.&lt;ref name=TimesAnalysis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pareles commented, "rock has been transformed from nemesis to novelty to mainstay. ... Broadway productions can’t match the visceral impact – starting with volume – of a rock concert. (They try to make up for it with enthusiasm and slicker dancing.)"&lt;ref name=TimesAnalysis/&gt; Another problem for rock musicals is that rock shows "still leave theatergoers complaining that the characters are hollow. ... [However,] Broadway does provide current rock two major incentives. As the artistic unit of the album has been shattered, down to a handful of shuffled MP3’s, musical theater offers a refuge for songwriters who want to tell longer stories, the way the songwriter [[Stew (musician)|Stew]] did in his autobiographical rock musical ''[[Passing Strange]]''." Pareles also noted, "Broadway may be the final place in America, if not the known universe, where rock still registers as rebellious. In the decorous little jewel boxes that are Broadway’s theaters, raunch seems raunchier, and rock musicals flaunt four-letter words and lascivious simulations. ... There are, of course, commercial incentives. Broadway’s unbudgingly middle-aged audience is currently a generation that grew up on rock and R&amp;B and generally feels more comfortable taking reserved seats in small theaters than plunging into the scrum of a standing-room club audience, or dealing with a rowdy arena mob."&lt;ref name=TimesAnalysis/&gt;

Pareles attributed some of the new acceptance of rock as theatre to ''[[American Idol]]'' and its ilk, noting that some of the show's stars have moved to theatre. Also, "Rock’s old protestations of authenticity (versus Broadway contrivance) have been crumbling. As if glam rock in the ’70s and music video in the ’80s weren’t obvious enough in presenting rock as theater, pop’s video-era arena spectacles use the same technology as Las Vegas revues and Broadway shows."&lt;ref name=TimesAnalysis/&gt; Another driver of rock's acceptance is its own entry into middle age, Pareles said, noting that "as rock’s history stretches out ever longer ... it offers just as much room for ... the familiarity and nostalgia that keep the [[jukebox musical]]s running.&lt;ref name=TimesAnalysis/&gt; Still, Pareles concluded, "the last, crucial thrill of a rock performance – the unpredictability – stays just beyond Broadway’s reach. Two nights after the official opening of ''American Idiot'', [[Green Day]] itself played an unannounced encore. The show had poured on its razzle-dazzle. .... But Green Day set off pandemonium. ... Green Day’s members may not be able to act or execute choreography ... but they also hold rock’s wild card: the potential, realized or not, for spontaneity."&lt;ref name=TimesAnalysis/&gt;

'''Roderick Charles Smallwood''' (born 17 February 1950) is an English [[music manager]], best known as the co-manager of the British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]]. With his business partner, [[Andy Taylor (music entrepreneur)|Andy Taylor]], whom he met while studying at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], he founded the [[Sanctuary Records Group]] in 1979, which became the largest [[independent record label]] in the UK and the largest independent music management company in the world until its closure in 2007. Prior to managing Iron Maiden, Smallwood managed [[Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel]].

==Biography==

Smallwood was born and raised in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, where he grew up listening to [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] on the radio and playing [[cricket]] and [[rugby union]].&lt;ref name="Wall 73"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=73|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only when he began attending university that his musical interests expanded and he began listening to [[Deep Purple]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Grateful Dead]] and [[The Doors]].&lt;ref name="Wall 73"/&gt;

In the autumn of 1968, Smallwood began studying architecture at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he soon became involved in organising social events, such as the annual [[First and Third Trinity Boat Club May Ball|Trinity May Ball]],&lt;ref name="Wall 73"/&gt; for which he booked the "various acts".&lt;ref name="Wall 74"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=74|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was while undertaking these duties that he formed a friendship with fellow undergraduate and future business partner [[Andy Taylor (music entrepreneur)|Andy Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Wall 74"/&gt; From then on, Smallwood and Taylor worked on end-of-term events together and booked various musicians, including [[Graham Bond]], [[Chris Farlowe]], [[Bridget St John]], [[John Martyn]],&lt;ref name="Wall 76"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=76|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, most notably, the [[MC5]].&lt;ref name="Wall 78"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=78|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallwood acquired most of these artists from a local booking agency, Horus Arts, whose boss, Barry Hawkins, gave Smallwood advice which led to his career as a booking agent.&lt;ref name="Wall 77"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=77|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his final exams in 1971, Smallwood dropped out of university and moved to Paris with his girlfriend,&lt;ref name="Wall 80"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=80 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "it just seemed like the cool thing to do".&lt;ref name="Wall 80"/&gt; After three months in Paris, Smallwood undertook a job at a London booking agency, Gemini, in order to finance a trip to Morocco.&lt;ref name="Wall 80"/&gt; Through his work with Gemini, Smallwood was offered a "£35 a week" job with rival agency [[MAM Records|MAM]], and therefore abandoned his trip to Morocco.&lt;ref name="Wall 80"/&gt; After 18 months with MAM, Smallwood began managing English rock act [[Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel]]. Smallwood disliked working with Harley, whom he would later describe as "a pain - selfish, egotistical, obsessed" and thus "completely put me off management."&lt;ref name="Wall 81"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=81|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convinced by [[EMI]], Harley fired Trigram, his management agency, and Smallwood undertook the management of punk rock act [[Gloria Mundi]].&lt;ref name="Wall 82"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=82|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Smallwood decided to return to university to obtain a law degree, where he was given a copy of [[Iron Maiden]]'s [[The Soundhouse Tapes|demo tape]].&lt;ref name="Wall 83"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=83|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much deliberation, Smallwood eventually contacted [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]], the band's bassist and founder member, and arranged two pub gigs for the group in west London, one at the [[Windsor Castle, Maida Vale|Windsor Castle]] in [[Maida Vale]] and the other at [[The Swan, Hammersmith|The Swan]] in [[Hammersmith]].&lt;ref name="Wall 84"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=84|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bushell | first1 = Garry | authorlink1 = Garry Bushell | last2 = Halfin | first2 = Ross | authorlink2 = Ross Halfin | title = Running Free, The Official Story of Iron Maiden | edition = 2nd | publisher = Zomba Books | year = 1985 | page = 26 | isbn = 0-946391-84-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither show went to plan- the first was cancelled after the band refused to play early,&lt;ref name="Wall 84"/&gt; and the band had to perform the second without lead vocalist, [[Paul Di'Anno]], who was arrested for carrying a knife 30 minutes before the gig.&lt;ref name="Wall 85"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=85|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, Smallwood agreed to help the group, although, following his experiences with Steve Harley, he did not initially commit to becoming their full-time manager until he arranged the band's signing to EMI and publishers Zomba at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Wall 86"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=86|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually joined by Andy Taylor in 1982,&lt;ref name="Wall 230"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=230|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pair have managed the group ever since.

After committing himself to managing Iron Maiden in October 1979, Smallwood decided to form his own management company, which he would name after Iron Maiden's second single, "[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]".&lt;ref name="Wall 115"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd | publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=115|authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanctuary Records Group]] eventually expanded into the largest [[independent record label]] in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanctuary may sell off some units|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6301077.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=26 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; until its closure in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanctuary's UK music arm to close|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6980221.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, in November 2006, Smallwood left Sanctuary and formed Phantom Music Management with Andy Taylor, which focuses solely on Iron Maiden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Daniel|title=Iron Maiden manager talks Sanctuary split|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/iron-maiden-manager-talks-sanctuary-split/|work=[[Metal Hammer]]|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=6 November 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213173605/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/iron-maiden-manager-talks-sanctuary-split/|archivedate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Iron Maiden [[A-side and B-side|b-side]] "Sheriff of [[Huddersfield]]" was written by Iron Maiden about Rod Smallwood, and was released on the 1986 single "[[Wasted Years]]". It likens Smallwood to the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], due to his notorious stinginess with money, and refers to his frequent complaining about a (then recent) move to [[Los Angeles]]. Smallwood did not know about the song until the single was released.

English pop [[girl group]] the '''[[Spice Girls]]''' have starred in one '''feature film''', as well as several '''television specials, documentaries and commercials'''. They made their film debut in 1997, starring in their feature film ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]''. The film was a commercial success, but was widely panned by critics, earning the group the [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

The Spice Girls have hosted various television specials. In November 1997, the Spice Girls became the first pop group to host [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s ''[[An Audience with...]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Stork Club''' was a [[nightclub]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], which during its existence from 1929 to 1965 was one of the most prestigious clubs in the world. A symbol of [[café society]], the wealthy elite, including movie stars, celebrities, [[showgirl]]s, and aristocrats all mixed in the VIP Cub Room of the club.

==Overview==
The club was established on West 58th Street in 1929 by [[Sherman Billingsley]], a former bootlegger from [[Enid, Oklahoma]]. After an incident when Billingsley was kidnapped and held for ransom by [[Mad Dog Coll]], a rival of his mobster partners, he became the sole owner of the Stork Club. The club remained at its original location until it was raided by [[Prohibition]] agents in 1931. After the raid, it moved to East 51st Street. From 1934 until its closure in 1965, it was located at 3 East [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]], just east of [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]], when it became world-renowned with its celebrity clientele and luxury. Billingsley was known for his lavish gifts, which brought a steady stream of celebrities to the club and also insured that those interested in the famous would have a reason to visit.

Until World War II, the club consisted of a dining room and bar with restrooms on upper floors with many mirrors and fresh flowers throughout.  Billingsley originally built the well-known Cub Room as a private place where he could play cards with friends.  Described as a "lopsided oval", the room had wood paneled walls hung with portraits of beautiful women and had no windows.  A head waiter known as "Saint Peter" determined who was allowed entry to the Cub Room, where [[Walter Winchell]] wrote his columns and broadcast his radio programs from Table 50.

During the years of its operation, the club was visited by many political, social, and celebrity figures.  It counted among its guests the Kennedy and Roosevelt families, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The news of Grace Kelly's engagement to Prince Rainier of Monaco broke while the couple were visiting the Stork Club. Socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean, owner of the [[Hope Diamond]], once lost the gem under a Stork Club table during an evening visit to the club. Ernest Hemingway was able to cash his $100,000 check for the film rights of ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' at the Stork Club to settle his bill.

In the 1940s, workers of the Stork Club desired to be represented by a union, and by 1957, the employees of all similar New York venues were union members. However, Billingsley was still unwilling to allow his workers to organize, which led to union supporters picketing in front of the club for many years until its closure.  During this time, many of the club's celebrity and non-celebrity guests stopped visiting the Stork Club; it closed in 1965 and was demolished the following year. The site is now the location of [[Paley Park]], a small [[pocket park|vest-pocket park]].

==History==

===Early history===

The Stork Club was owned and operated by [[Sherman Billingsley]] (1896–1966) an ex-[[Rum-running|bootlegger]] who came to New York from [[Enid, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nichols, Max|title=Oklahoma, Bootleggers, and Cafe Society|work=[[The Journal Record]]|date= July 13, 2000|accessdate=June 24, 2008|url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P2-5741679/oklahoma-bootleggers-and-caf-society}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In later years, Billingsley claimed to have been born in 1900, but this is refuted by both the 1930 census and the Social Security Death Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JPH9-F4X|title=Social Security Death Index for Sherman Billingsley|publisher=Familysearch.org|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=age|group=note}}  The ''Stork Club'' first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, just down the street from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street.&lt;ref name="Stork"&gt;{{cite news|author=Blumenthal, Ralph|title=Look who Dropped in at the Stork|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 1, 1996|accessdate=June 24, 2008|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEFD91339F932A35754C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xGLXWx6o?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEFD91339F932A35754C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|archivedate=March 17, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/carltait/152West58_NotablePastResidents.htm |title=152 West 58th Street - Notable Past Residents |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018182300/http://mysite.verizon.net/carltait/152West58_NotablePastResidents.htm |archivedate=October 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, "Don't ask me how or why I picked the name, because I just don't remember."&lt;ref name="Stork"/&gt;{{sfn|Kellow|2007|p=76}} New York City's [[El Morocco]] had the sophistication and [[Toots Shor's Restaurant|Toots Shor's]] drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor.{{sfn|Kellow|2007|p=137}}  Unlike its competitors, the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|p=4}}

One of the first Stork Club customers was writer [[Heywood Broun]], who resided in the vicinity.  Broun's first visit to the Stork was actually made by mistake; he believed it to be a [[funeral home]], but he soon became a regular, and invited his celebrity friends, as the name of the club spread further afield. Before long, Billingsley's Oklahoma partners sold their shares to a man named Thomas Healy.&lt;ref name="Stork"/&gt; Eventually Healy revealed that he was a "[[Front organization|front]]" for three New York mobsters.&lt;ref name="Closed"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Healy told Billingsley the three mobsters were [[Owney Madden]], Big Bill Dwyer and Frenchy De Mange.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|p=103}}|name=mob|group=note}} Billingsley was kidnapped and held for ransom by [[Mad Dog Coll]], who was a rival of his mob partners. Before the ransom money could be collected by Coll, he was lured to a telephone booth where he was shot to death.{{#tag:ref|Billingsley's notes indicate he was forced into a car on Madison Avenue and blindfolded after having dinner with Texas Guinan.&lt;ref name=Stork/&gt; Only a few hours before Coll was killed, [[Walter Winchell]]'s ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' column said that he would be gunned down by members of the Chicago mob, who had arrived in New York for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1697944/winchell_predicts_coll_death/|title=Columnist predicted murder|date=February 8, 1932|newspaper=[[Dunkirk Evening Observer]]|page=1|accessdate=February 2, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1698166/coll_death/|title=Vincent Coll Slain In New York Drug Store Earlier Today|date=February 8, 1932|publisher=The Sedalia Democrat|page=1|accessdate=February 2, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Coll was on the telephone with Owney Madden when he was shot to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/mad-dog-coll-mayhem-article-1.841038|title=Mad Dog Coll Mayhem|author=Maeder, Jay|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=October 24, 1999|accessdate=February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=Coll|group=note}} After the incident, the secret gangster partners reluctantly allowed Billingsley to buy them out for [[United States Dollar|$]]30,000.&lt;ref name="Stork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;

Another New York nightclub owner, [[Tex Guinan]], introduced Billingsley to her friend, the entertainment and gossip columnist [[Walter Winchell]], in 1930.&lt;ref name="Sherman"/&gt; In September 1930, Winchell called the Stork Club "New York's New Yorkiest place on W. 58th" in his ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' column. That evening, the Stork Club was filled with moneyed guests.&lt;ref name="Sherman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EkYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=58oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6793,4463172&amp;dq=stork+club&amp;hl=en|title=Things You Never Knew About Winchell|page=4|author=Billingsley, Sherman|date=August 24, 1941|newspaper=Herald-Journal|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowd"/&gt; Someone else who read Winchell's column in 1930 was singer-actress [[Helen Morgan]], who had just finished filming a movie on Long Island.  Morgan decided to hold a cast party at the Stork Club, paying the tab with two $1,000 bills.&lt;ref name=reservation&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Colliers-1938oct01-00020?View=PDF|title=Have You a Reservation?|journal=[[Collier's]]|date=October 1, 1938|last1=Reynolds |first1=Quentin |authorlink1=Quentin Reynolds |pages=16, 41–43|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winchell became a regular at the Stork Club; what he saw and heard there at his private Table 50 was the basis of his newspaper columns and radio broadcasts.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|p=42}}{{sfn|Kellow|2007|p=138}}&lt;ref name="Closed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Then"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/amp-stork-catered-creme-de-la-creme-article-1.774923|title=Then &amp; Now: When The Stork Catered To The Creme De La Creme|author=Connors, Anthony|date=October 5, 1997|newspaper=New York Daily News|accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billingsley also kept professionals on his staff whose job was to listen to the chatter, determine fact from rumor, and then report the factual news to local columnists.

In early 1944, New York mayor [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] ordered a check on the books of all major city night clubs. City tax accountants soon investigated the Stork Club, the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]], and other city night spots. By July, auditors turned in a report claiming that the clubs were overcharging patrons on tax, sending the city the proper amount and keeping the overbilled sums. On a Saturday in July, city officials arrived at the Stork Club with a court order granting permission for them to seize the club's property for the amount which was claimed to be overcharged as taxes, plus penalties.  The total for the Stork Club was $181,000. Billingsley, out of town with his family, was notified.  The club's employees refused to turn anything over to the officials, who were intent on closing it. Upon his return, Billingsley firmly protested that the Stork Club did not owe the city any money and was up to date on its tax payments. A compromise was reached: the club could stay open as long as a custodian for the city was allowed to be on the premises. Billingsley was eventually able to get a court order to eject the custodian, but the case dragged on for five years, costing Billingsley $100,000.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|pp=26-29}}&lt;ref name=sclub&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1767337/obit/|title=Billingsley, Stork Club Owner, Dies|date=October 4, 1966|page=3|newspaper=[[La Crosse Tribune]]|accessdate=February 12, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 1951, [[Josephine Baker]] made charges of racism against the Stork Club.  Baker visited the club on October 16 as the guest of Roger Rico and his wife; both entertainers were at the Stork after their theater performances.&lt;ref name=Rico&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1734123/mrs_roger_rico_october_19_1951/|title=Josephine Baker Charges Stork Club With Racial Discrimination|date=October 19, 1951|page=1|newspaper=[[The Norwich Sun]]|accessdate=February 7, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker said she ordered a steak and was apparently still waiting for it an hour later. &lt;!--Actress [[Grace Kelly]], who was at the club at the time, rushed over to Baker, took her by the arm and stormed out with her entire party.--&gt; The controversy grew when Baker accused Walter Winchell of being in the Cub Room at the time and not coming to her aid.  Winchell was at the club; he said he had greeted Baker and vocalist Roger Rico as the two left their Cub Room table. Winchell said he was not aware of there being any problem, and left for a late screening of the film ''[[The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel|The Desert Fox]]''. The next morning, Winchell's rumored failure to assist Baker was big news, and he received countless telephone calls. The incident blew into a major scandal and was widely publicized on the radio and newspapers.&lt;ref name="NYT2001"/&gt; Mrs. Rico, who was part of the Baker party with her husband, said that Baker's steak was waiting for her at the table after she returned from her phone call, but the entertainer chose to make a stormy exit from the Stork anyhow.

Along with that of Billingsley and the Stork Club, Walter Winchell's name was further tarnished by the incident. After leaving the Stork, the Baker party made contact with [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]]'s [[Barry Gray (radio)|Barry Gray]], where the story was told as part of Gray's radio talk show. One of those who phoned Gray's program was television personality and columnist [[Ed Sullivan]], a professional rival of Winchell's whose "home base" was the El Morocco nightclub.  Sullivan's on-air remarks dealt mainly with Winchell's alleged part in the event, saying, "What Winchell has done is an insult to the United States and American newspapermen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZcAVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VxAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4265,4609430&amp;dq=stork+club+baker&amp;hl=en|title=As Pegler Sees It|last1=Pegler |first1=Westbrook |authorlink1=Westbrook Pegler |date=January 28, 1955|newspaper=The Kingston Daily Freeman|page=4|accessdate=December 31, 2016|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winchell's column of October 24, 1951, provides the same details as earlier news stories about Josephine Baker's accusations that he did not assist her at the Stork Club.

A New York police investigation of the matter followed the complaint made by the NAACP.  The police investigation found that the Stork Club did not discriminate against Josephine Baker. The NAACP went on to say that the results of the police investigation did not provide enough evidence for the organization to pursue the incident further in criminal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8082144/stork_club_cleared_in_baker_case/|title=Stork Club Cleared in Baker Case|date=November 30, 1951|page=2|newspaper=The Indiana Gazette|accessdate=December 31, 2016|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker filed suit against Winchell over the matter, but the suit was dismissed in 1955.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; Walter Winchell later said.

Because of Billingsley's long-standing friendship with [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During his work on the Stork Club book, author and ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by [[Jean-Claude Baker]], one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/stork-club-special-delivery-exhibit-new-york-historical-society-recalls-glamour-wind-article-1.873537|title=Stork Club Special Delivery Exhibit at the New York Historical Society recalls a glamour gone with the wind|author=Kissel, Howard|date=May 3, 2000|accessdate=August 29, 2010|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the physical layout of the club, as described by Ed Sullivan in a 1939 column, the Stork should have been doomed to failure, since it was strangely shaped and far from roomy in places.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt; The club's ladies' room was on the second floor of the structure and the men's room was on the third; only the dining room, bar, and later the Cub Room were on the first floor.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|p=17}} Despite this, the club could hold 1,000 guests.{{sfn|Sylvester|1956|p=109}} A feature of the club was a solid 14-karat gold chain at its entrance; patrons were allowed entry through it by the doorman.&lt;ref name="Jitterbuzz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jitterbuzz.com/menus.html|title=The Stork Club|publisher=Jitterbuzz.com|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/legacy/i/partypictures/04_01_13/Untitled-1.jpg |title=Photo of gold chain at Stork Club entrance |publisher=Stork Club.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131215342/http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/legacy/i/partypictures/04_01_13/Untitled-1.jpg |archivedate=January 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bKUiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uK0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=980,170438&amp;dq=goodman+ace&amp;hl=en|title=The Lyons Den|author=Lyons, Leonard|date=January 3, 1949|newspaper=[[Beaver Valley Times]]|page=4|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the East 53rd Street building came down to make way for Paley Park, one of the artifacts found in it was a [[still]].

Besides the Cub Room, the Main Dining Room, and the bar, the club contained a room for parties, the "Blessed Event Room", a large private room on the second floor with its own kitchen and bar, the "Loner's Room", which was just past the Cub Room and much like a men's club, and a private barber shop.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|pp=17, 288}}&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uR4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E6wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3586,6108068&amp;dq=stork+club&amp;hl=en|title=News Behind the News|page=4|author=Ross, George|date=June 23, 1936|newspaper=[[The Owosso Argus-Press]]|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Blessed Event Room was added to the Stork Club, its walls were entirely mirrored.

Billingsley's original plan for the Cub Room was for it to be a private place for playing [[gin rummy]] with his friends.{{#tag:ref|Billingsley told some friends he had built the room as a private place for [[Ethel Merman]] after her theater performances; he told others he built it while trying to get over her after their affair had ended.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|p=2}}|name=cub|group=note}}&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; The room was added to the club during World War II.

The room was lit with pink tones.  On the wood-paneled walls were paintings of beautiful women; Billingsley also had similar portraits by the same artist in the ladies' powder room.&lt;ref name=Billingsley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spoonercentral.com/spooner615/SOBEL.JPG|title=New York Cavalcade|author=Sobol, Louis|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|"Beautiful women are the only decoration worth a damn in a night club."-Sherman Billingsley&lt;ref name=sclub/&gt;|name=quote|group=note}} After the club's labor problems began in 1957, Billingsley redecorated the entire club, choosing emerald green for the carpet and chairs, and a pinkish-red for the [[banquette]]s.

Author T. C. McNult has referred to the Stork Club during its existence as "the most celebrated nightspot in the world";{{Sfn|McNulty|2012|p=173}} while author Ed McMahon has called it the "most realistic nightclub of all", a name "synonymous with fame, class, and money, in no particular order".{{Sfn|McMahon|2007|p=140}}  Society writer [[Lucius Beebe]] wrote in 1946: "To millions and millions of people all of over the world the Stork symbolizes and epitomizes the ''de luxe'' upholstery of quintessentially urban existence. It means fame; it means wealth; it means an elegant way of life among celebrated folk".{{Sfn|Duecy|2013}} The club was a prime example of the flourishing cafe society at the time, but the real purpose of the Stork Club, according to journalist Ed Sullivan, was people watching other people, particularly non-celebrities watching celebrities.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt; Author Mearl L. Allen, however, highlights that the club was more than a celebrity playground, and that "many decisions of tremendous social and economic importance regarding world affairs were made in the Stork Club during this time", and the likes of [[Desi Arnaz]] and [[Lucille Ball]] could often be seen conversing with executive types.{{sfn|Allen|1980|p=148}} Mark Bernardo, author of ''Mad Men's Manhattan: The Insider's Guide'', has said: "In some ways, the Stork Club was ahead of its time—courting celebrities by picking up their tabs, hiring a house photographer who sent candid shots of guests to the tabloids, and offering a private enclave called the Cub Room, where stars could huddle away from the prying eyes of fans, all hallmarks of modern clubs that cater to boldface names".{{sfn|Bernardo|2010|p=33}} The venue was usually packed with luminaries during its golden years, and dining orders could take a long time to be dealt with.{{sfn|Wilson|2004|p=16}}

Notable guests through the years included Lucille Ball, [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Joan Blondell]],{{sfn|Kennedy|2007|p=103}} [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Frank Costello]], [[Bing Crosby]], the [[Edward VIII|Duke]] and [[Wallis Simpson|Duchess of Windsor]], [[Brenda Frazier]], [[Dorothy Frooks]], [[Carmen Miranda]], [[Dana Andrews]], [[Michael O'Shea (actor)|Michael O'Shea]], [[Judy Garland]], the [[William Averell Harriman|Harrimans]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Judy Holliday]], [[J.

The main room of the club was also frequented by many of the prominent figures that had fled Europe, from royals to businessmen, debutantes, sportsmen and military dignitaries, who often, upon departing, took with them the signature ashtrays of the club as souvenirs.{{Sfn|Goldstein|2010|p=200}} The news of Grace Kelly's engagement to [[Prince Rainier of Monaco]] broke at the Stork. The couple was at the club on Tuesday, January 3, 1956, as the rumors flew. Veteran columnist [[Jack O'Brian]] passed Kelly a note, saying that reliable sources indicated she was about to become engaged to the Prince.  Kelly replied she could not answer the question posed by O'Brian until Friday.&lt;ref name="Stork"/&gt;{{sfn|Taraborelli|2003|p=225}} Socialite [[Evalyn Walsh McLean]], owner of the [[Hope Diamond]], wore the gem as if it was costume jewelry.

===Conduct===
[[File:Humphrey Bogart 1945.JPG|thumb|right|Humphrey Bogart, who was banned from the club after a heated argument with Billingsley.]]
Guests were expected to dress to high standards, with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing "gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow". All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage, compliments of the Stork Club.&lt;ref name=reservation/&gt; A requirement for all men was a necktie; those who were not wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance.{{sfn|Sylvester|1956|p=126}} Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry, there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome.{{sfn|Haygood|2011|p=257}} Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests; fighting, drunkenness, or rowdiness were prohibited.&lt;ref name=Billingsley/&gt; He ran the club on the principle of it being a place where people could have a good time and that it was somewhere he could bring his own family without worrying that they would see or hear something he did not want them to.&lt;ref name=SC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1766292/stork/|title=Stork Club Makes Friends But Bounces Some|newspaper=[[The Ogden Standard-Examiner]]|date=April 21, 1957|page=3|accessdate=February 12, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club.{{sfn|Batterberry|Batterberry|1999|p=258}} Unescorted women were not allowed to enter the club after 6:00 p.m; this was a protective measure for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|p=103}}

Billingsley had planned an engagement party for Roosevelt and his girlfriend, vocalist Gigi Durston, on the basis of the couple's friends' statements that they were going to be married.  Durston had once worked at the Stork Club as a singer and Roosevelt was a longtime customer of the club.  Billingsley sent out publicity notices about the party; the couple told him that they had no plans to announce their engagement at that time. Roosevelt was banned from the Stork and the party was canceled.&lt;ref name=Elliott/&gt; [[Jackie Gleason]], who was a frequent guest of the club with his two daughters, was being seated with a female companion when the couple was asked to leave the premises in March 1957. Billingsley claimed that Gleason's conversation became loud and off-color when he arrived at a table and barred Gleason from the Stork Club for life.  Gleason said that he had done nothing wrong. He wondered if the problem was because he was a member of the Musicians' Union, since the club's wait and kitchen staff had been on strike since January of that year.&lt;ref name=Gleason/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&amp;dat=19570305&amp;id=MkEaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6886,2809637|page=5|newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]|date=March 5, 1957|title=Report Gleason Ejected From Stork Club|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the rules and banishments, there were incidents which made their way into newspapers. Billingsley associate Steve Hannagan believed that one "good fight" a year was permissible for a respectable night club. [[Johnny Weissmuller]] accused a Navy lieutenant of using a lit cigarette to burn the clothing of dancers as they passed his table. The lieutenant advised Weissmuller to get a haircut; his wife told Weissmuller to go back to Hollywood with the other ape-men. The Navy man suffered two black eyes and complained that Weissmuller's friends held him as he was punched by Weissmuller.  Ernest Hemingway once took issue with a stranger who slapped him on the back; knocking him into three chairs and a table as he brushed him away. Billingsley contended that many of the incidents that appeared in print were minor disagreements which were inflated by the press.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt;

[[Jack Benny]] invited longtime friend, writer, and performer [[Goodman Ace]] to lunch with him at the Stork. Ace arrived at the club first and received the "[[cold shoulder]]" because he was not recognized by the staff. When Benny arrived and asked for Ace, he was told that Ace became tired of waiting and left. Soon Ace began to receive mail from the Stork, which he proceeded to answer in his tongue in cheek style.  Ace's response to the message about the club having wonderful air conditioning was that after having received the cold shoulder there, he was well aware of the climate. Bilingsley responded to Ace with a gift of some Stork Club bow ties. Ace then asked for some matching socks so he might be in style to be turned away again. Ace and his wife became regulars at the club after the issue was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6lgbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pEwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1569,2567585&amp;dq=goodman+ace&amp;hl=en|title=Easy Ace Is Not So Easy|page=28|author=Steinhauser, Si|date=January 28, 1945|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13821896/goodman_acestork_club/|title=It Happened Last Night|page=22|author=Wilson, Earl|date=October 31, 1944|publisher=Akron Beacon Journal|accessdate=January 10, 2017|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owner Billingsley was well known for his extravagant gifts presented to his favorite patrons, spending an average of $100,000 a year on them.  They included compacts studded with diamonds and rubies, French perfumes, Champagne and liquor, and even automobiles.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cosmo/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifts"&gt;{{cite news|title=In New York|author=Ross, George|date=March 8, 1938|newspaper=[[The Modesto Bee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Google has removed the Modesto Bee from its newspaper archive --&gt; Many of the gifts were specially made for the Stork Club, with the club's name and logo on them.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Some of the best known examples were the gifts of ''Sortilège'' perfume by [[Le Galion]], which became known as the "fragrance of the Stork Club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Product Marketing for Beauty Industry Retailers &amp; Manufacturers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVoqAQAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=U.S. Business Press|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billingsley convinced [[Arthur Godfrey]], [[Morton Downey]], and his own assistant, Steve Hannigan, to form an investment group with him to obtain the United States distributorship of the fragrance.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|p=34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/le-galion-sortilege-perfume-presentation|title=Le Galion 'Sortilege' perfume presentation|publisher=WorthPoint|accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8081675/sortilege_stork_club_ad/|title=Newspaper ad for Sortilege|date=March 22, 1951|page=29|newspaper=The Bridgeport Telegram|accessdate=December 30, 2016|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partners expanded into the sale of soap, cosmetics and other sundries under the Stork Club name.

Billingsley's generosity was not confined to those who were always at the club.  He received the following letter in 1955: "I am grateful to you for your thoughtful kindness in sending me such a generous selection of attractive neckties. At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House." It was signed by [[Dwight D.

The notables were what brought people from all over the country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club.{{sfn|Kellow|2007|p=77}}&lt;ref name=SC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; 
&lt;!-- Comment Sherman was also generous toward his extensive family.  He sent his younger sister, Lottie Billingsley, a Ford Touring Car, shipping the entire thing cross country in the early '20s.  His niece, Geraldine, married an Air Force Lieutenant without any means of support after World War II ended, and provided him with a job in management.  Geraldine and her husband, Sam, lived on the fourth floor of the new Stork Club building, where their first two daughters were born in 1944 and 1947.&lt;primary source; I am Sherman's great-niece, and have the invoice for the touring car as well as photographs of my family members with Sherman and at the club.

==In popular culture==
''The Stork Club'' was a [[television program|television series]] hosted by Billingsley, who circulated among the tables interviewing guests at the club.

'''Street theatre''' is a form of [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] and presentation in outdoor [[public space]]s without a specific paying audience. These spaces can be anywhere, including [[Shopping mall|shopping centres]], [[Parking lot|car parks]], recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. The actors who perform street theatre range from [[busking|busker]]s to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance spaces, or to promote their mainstream work. It was a source of providing information to people when there were no sources of providing information like television, radio etc. Nowadays, street play is used to convey a message to the crowd watching it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2011/08/street-plays-a-means-of-spreading-awareness/&lt;/ref&gt; Street play is considered to be the rawest form of acting, because one does not have a microphone or loud speakers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Sometimes performers are commissioned, especially for street [[festival]]s, children's shows or [[parade]]s, but more often street theatre performers are unpaid or gather some income through the dropping of a coin in a hat by the audience.

The logistics of doing street theatre necessitate simple [[costume]]s and [[Theatrical property|prop]]s, and often there is little or no [[Electronic amplifier|amplification]] of sound, with actors depending on their natural [[human voice|vocal]] and physical ability. This issue with sound has meant that [[physical theatre]], including dance, [[mime artist|mime]] and [[slapstick]], is a very popular genre in an outdoor setting. The performances need to be highly visible, loud and simple to follow in order to attract a crowd.

Street theatre should be distinguished from other more formal outdoor theatrical performances, such as performances in a park or garden, where there is a discrete space set aside (or [[rope]]d off) and a [[Ticket (admission)|ticketed]] audience.

In some cases, street theatre performers have to get a [[licence]] or specific permission through [[local government|local]] or [[State (subnational)|state]] [[government]]s in order to perform. Many performers travel internationally&lt;ref&gt;[http://performers.net/ International list of performers]&lt;/ref&gt; to certain locations of note.

Street theatre is arguably the oldest form of theatre in existence: most mainstream entertainment mediums can be traced back to origins in street performing, including religious [[passion plays]] and many other forms. More recently performers who, a hundred years ago, would have made their living working in [[variety theatre]]s, [[music hall]]s and in [[vaudeville]], now often perform professionally in the many well-known street performance areas throughout the world. Notable performers that began their careers as street theatre performers include [[Robin Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;Robin Williams began his career on the streets of San Francisco as a street performer: https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800013042/bio&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bowie]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] and [[Harry Anderson]].

Street theatre allows people who might not have ever been to, or been able to afford to go to, traditional theatre. The audience is made up of anyone and everyone who wants to watch and for most performances is free entertainment.

==Reasons for staging work on the street==

Performance artists with an interest in social activism may choose to stage their work on the street as a means of directly confronting or engaging the public. For example, multimedia artist Caeser Pink and his group of performers known as The Imperial Orgy staged a piece titled ''Our Daily Bread''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/CaeserPinkOurDailyBread-OrgyStreetTheateronWallStreet Archive Video]&lt;/ref&gt; that brought performers onto the streets of the New York's financial district to ceremoniously lay loaves of [[Wonder Bread]] along the sidewalks, each with an advertisement from Satan offering to buy people's souls in exchange for material possessions. The performance caused an uproar when police were called out and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to inspect the loaves of bread for explosives.

Other artists consider a paying, theatre-going public to be unrepresentative of the public to whom they are trying to communicate, and performing to 'the man on the street' may be considered a more democratic form of dissemination.

Some contemporary street theatre practitioners have extensively studied pre-existing street and popular theatre traditions, such as [[Carnival]], [[commedia dell'arte]] etc. and wish to present them in a situation close to their original context.

Whatever the reason for choosing the street, the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of [[Welfare State International]] argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor is it simply taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last = Coult | editor-first = Tony | editor2-last = Kershaw | editor2-first = Baz | title = Engineers of the Imagination: The Welfare State Handbook | publisher = Methuen | year = 1983 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oPkCAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;dq=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;pgis=1 | isbn = 0-413-52800-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSI India street play.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A street play (''nukkad natak'') in [[Dharavi]] slums in Mumbai]].
Many companies are politically motivated and use street theatre to combine performance with protest. This has occurred through the [[guerrilla theatre]] of [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doyle | first = Michael William | title = Imagine Nation: The American Counterculture of the '60s and '70s | publisher = Routeledge | year = 2001 | url = http://www.diggers.org/guerrilla_theater.htm | isbn = 0-415-93040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Living Theatre]], the carnivalesque parades of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], and the work of [[Ashesh Malla]] and the Sarwanam Theatre Group of [[Nepal]].

A character-based street theatre which developed in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull Puncture Repair Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a ''[[Candid Camera]]'' way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.

Another example would be Natural Theatre's Pink Suitcase scenario. A number of smartly dressed people carrying bright pink suitcases enter a set of streets or buildings. They search for and miss their companions. In their search they get on buses, hail cabs, end up in shop windows, etc. By the time they meet up at a pre-arranged spot with the help of passers-by, perceptions of the area have changed and shopping has ceased for at least a few moments. The humour is universal and this piece has been seen in nearly seventy countries. It is usually performed by four or five actors, but has been done with twenty-five.

'''''Three Dirty Dwarves''''' is a 1996 [[beat 'em up]] [[video game]] developed by [[Appaloosa Interactive]] and published by [[Sega]] for their [[Sega Saturn]] console. It was later ported to PC.

Even before its release on the Saturn, SegaSoft announced that ''Three Dirty Dwarves'' would be the first game they would publish for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] once they acquired a PlayStation software license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Sega Soft Plans PlayStation Titles|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=95|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=August 1996|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, SegaSoft ended up never publishing any games for the PlayStation.

==Gameplay==
Most levels in ''Three Dirty Dwarves'' play in a typical beat 'em up format: players must advance the characters to the end of the stage, defeating any enemies which block the way. Up to three players take control of the three titular dwarves, with each player controlling one dwarf at a time; if there are fewer than three players, the player(s) can change which dwarf they are controlling at any time. A single hit from an enemy or obstacle will render a dwarf unconscious, but if another dwarf is still in action he can revive an unconscious dwarf by attacking him, effectively slapping him awake.&lt;ref name="GPro98"/&gt;

Each dwarf has a short-range attack and a long-range attack, though the speed and responsiveness of each attack varies according to the dwarf. In addition, the dwarves can spend skulls to activate special team attacks, such as starting a fight with each other or morphing into one of three huge gestalt dwarves. Skull are acquired by picking them up from fallen enemies or breaking open boxes.&lt;ref name="EGM87"/&gt;

==Story==
Four children genetically engineered by the army grow up to be child geniuses instead of perfect soldiers, prompting General Briggs to use them to manufacture weaponry.&lt;ref name="EGM87"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Three Dirty Dwarves: They're Makeshift Sportsmen and, Man, Do they Stink|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=87 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=October 1996|pages=128-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To escape, the children play their favorite [[role-playing game]] and lead the party - a trio of slow-witted but heroic dwarves - to a gateway into the real world. The dwarves' equipment burns up during [[atmospheric entry]]. They land in a [[sporting goods store]] and make use of the equipment inside for their weapons and armor. The monsters from the role-playing game world have followed the dwarves into the real world, and the dwarves must battle their way through them to find the children and confront General Briggs.&lt;ref name="EGM87"/&gt;

After the dwarves defeat Briggs' subordinate Barney and get past the army bases' automated defenses, Briggs offers them jobs in the army with generous benefits. The dwarves are on the verge of taking the offer, so the children roll the die for their role-playing game until the right number comes up, forcing the dwarves to turn down Briggs' offer and insist on the children's release. Briggs complies, but the dwarves proceed to beat him up anyway. The children use the distraction to sneak off of the base to freedom.

The Sega Saturn version received moderately positive reviews, with most critics praising the game's humor and personality.&lt;ref name="EGM87rev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGen23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GPro98"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Three Dirty Dwarves |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=98 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=November 1996 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' especially praised the comic weirdness of the cutscenes and the general fun of the game.&lt;ref name="EGM87rev"/&gt; A ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic remarked that the side-scrolling beat 'em up genre was becoming tried, but that ''Three Dirty Dwarves'', while not genuinely innovative, "offers just enough new spins on the tradition to make it a worthwhile venture." He found the varied and often surprising levels and the consistently solid challenge to be key.&lt;ref name="NGen23"/&gt; Major Mike of ''[[GamePro]]'' said the jumping and three-dimensional gameplay can be awkward, but aspects such as the three-player mode and humor "make this game something special."&lt;ref name="GPro98"/&gt; Rob Allsetter of ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' gave ''Three Dirty Dwarves'' one of its few negative reviews, calling it "a very irritating and mundane platform game". He lambasted the game's humor and said the gameplay is repetitive.&lt;ref name="SatMag15"/&gt;

The '''Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation '''('''ZBC''') is the state-controlled broadcaster in [[Zimbabwe]]. It was established as the '''Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation''' ('''RBC'''), taking its current name in 1980. Like the RBC before it, the ZBC has been accused of being a [[government mouthpiece]] with no [[editorial independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindependent.co.zw/2012/02/16/muckraker-zbc-has-taken-over-the-rbcs-mantle/ 'MuckRaker: ZBC has taken over the RBC's mantle'], ''[[Zimbabwe Independent]]'', 16 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Introduction of radio===
Radio was first introduced in the then [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1933, in Belvedere in Salisbury (now [[Harare]]) by [[Imperial Airways]], which was used to provide radio guidance and weather reports.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZgptYdAcsOgC&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=zbc%20radio%204&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''World Broadcasting: A Comparative View''], Alan Wells, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, pages 157-159&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1941 that the first professional broadcaster was established.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LJbFniZhtDQC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22Southern%20Rhodesia%22%20%22radio%22%201933&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Southern%20Rhodesia%22%20%22radio%22%201933&amp;f=false ''Zimbabwe: A Survey''], African Minds, 2009, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; This was known as the Central African Broadcasting Service (CABS) and had responsibility for broadcasting in [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) and [[Nyasaland]] (now [[Malawi]]) as well as Southern Rhodesia.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the creation of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] in 1953, a new organisation was established on 1 February 1958, known as the Federal Broadcasting Corporation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (FBC).&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DnFHAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Federal+Broadcasting+Corporation+of+Rhodesia+and+Nyasaland%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Federal+Broadcasting+Corporation%22 ''Handbook to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland''], Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Federal Information Dept, William Vernon Brelsford, Cassell, 1960, page 552&lt;/ref&gt; However, CABS continued to operate as a radio station aimed at African audiences.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When the Federation was dissolved in 1963, the FBC was succeeded by a new organisation responsible for broadcasting in Southern Rhodesia, known as the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=30&amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enGB751GB751&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=662&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22The+Federal+Broadcasting+Corporation+came+into+being+on+1+February+1958%2C+and+lasted+until+the+break-up+of+the+Federation+in+December+1963%22&amp;oq=%22The+Federal+Broadcasting+Corporation+came+into+being+on+1+February+1958%2C+and+lasted+until+the+break-up+of+the+Federation+in+December+1963%22&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...11921.17478.0.18329.2.2.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0.dummy_maps_web_fallback...0...1.1.64.psy-ab..2.0.0....0.us36OBUNwz0 ''Handbook of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association''], Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, 1988, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of television===
[[Television]] was introduced on 14 November 1960, first in [[Harare|Salisbury]], with transmissions in [[Bulawayo]] beginning seven months later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5sZBAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=rhodesia+television+rtv+1960&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=welensky ''EBU Review: Programmes, Administration, Law, Volume 71''], Administrative Office of the European Broadcasting Union, 1962, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; It was only the second such service in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xQBbVfPukGMC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=rtv+rhodesia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=26f1qRRMdU&amp;sig=1yTPAweyK_qpt8hnFGDMLsW4nM0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zjoYVcHYCcfYPeW1gZgC&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=rtv%20rhodesia&amp;f=true ''Zimbabwe's Cinematic Arts: Language, Power, Identity''], Katrina Daly Thompson, Indiana University Press, 2013, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; and the first such service in southern Africa, as [[South Africa]] did not [[Television in South Africa#Opposition to introduction|introduce television]] until 1976.&lt;ref name="Strack"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZVt0AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=south+africa+TV+1976+rhodesia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Without+television+until+1976%22 ''Sanctions: The Case of Rhodesia''], Harry R.

It was initially operated by a private company, Rhodesian Television (RTV) on behalf of the then FBC, with its major shareholders being [[South Africa]]n companies, including the [[Cape Argus|Argus Group]] of newspapers, parent company of the ''[[Rhodesia Herald]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B2Jp-k0WVWAC&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;vq=Argus&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=Argus&amp;f=true ''Against the Grain: Memoirs of a Zimbabwean Newsman''], Geoffrey Nyarota, Zebra, 2006, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; and Davenport and Meyer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HrXVAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=rhodesia+television+rtv&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22rhodesian+television%22+ ''Viewing the Foreign and the Local in Zimbabwe: Film, Television, and the Shona Viewers''], Katrina Daly Thompson

RTV was taken over by the government,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yjq1owYBF_kC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=rtv%20rhodesia&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=rtv%20rhodesia&amp;f=false ''Media, Public Discourse and Political Contestation in Zimbabwe''], Henning Melber, Nordic Africa Institute, 2004, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; with the RBC initially acquired a 51 per cent stake in the service, which became part of the RBC in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=B0gYVaPOBo_3av2bgqgM&amp;id=T7MsAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=rtv+rhodesia+south+africa+sabc+1976&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=actual+part ''Broadcasting: An Introduction''], John R.

===Unilateral Declaration of Independence===
In 1965, the white minority government of [[Ian Smith]] issued a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]], under which censorship of broadcasting and the press was imposed, and key posts at the RBC were gradually filled by supporters of the ruling [[Rhodesian Front]] party.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gDqsCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA2713&amp;dq=%22Rhodesian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation%22%20%22Director%20General%22&amp;pg=PA2713#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rhodesian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation%22%20%22Director%20General%22&amp;f=false ''Censorship: A World Encyclopedia''], Derek Jones, Routledge, 2001, page 2713&lt;/ref&gt; The previous year, the Deputy Minister of Information, [[P.

On 1 January 1965, the RBC had ceased to relay the morning world news bulletin from the [[BBC]], and replaced it with a bulletin from the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMgHAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22RBC%22+%22Rhodesia%22+%22BBC%22+%22SABC%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22In+fact%2C+the+morning+world+news+bulletin%2C+previously+relayed+from+the+BBC%2C+was+replaced+with+an+SABC+broadcast%22 ''The Journalist''], 1981, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; However, afternoon and evening news relays of the BBC remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=On+1+January,+the+R.B.C.+discontinued+the+8+a.m.+news+relay+from+the+B.B.C.,+but+left+the+1+p.m.+and+6+p.m.+relays.+The+8+a.m.+relay+was+to+be+replaced+by+S.A.B.C.+news+relayed+from+Radio+South+Africa&amp;num=30&amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enGB751GB751&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=bks&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=662 ''News Letter''], Institute of Race Relations, London, 1965, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;  

The British government, which had denounced UDI as illegal, began broadcasting BBC programmes into Rhodesia by building a radio relay station in [[Francistown]], in the then [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]], now [[Botswana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8bg8jQxkSTcC&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=bbc%20rhodesia%20francistown&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q=bbc%20rhodesia%20francistown&amp;f=false ''Botswana's Search for Autonomy in Southern Africa''], Richard Dale, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, page 111&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhodesian government retaliated by clandestinely building a 400 000 watt transmitter nicknamed "Big Bertha", in order to jam the signal from the smaller BBC transmitter.&lt;ref name="Africa Today"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h89JAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Big+Bertha%22+Francistown&amp;dq=%22Big+Bertha%22+Francistown&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT2JGrj9PWAhVB1xoKHYZ6CTcQ6AEIKDAA ''Africa Today''], Volume 31, Africa Today Associates, 1984, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Programmes about Rhodesia were subjected to jamming, but other programmes were not affected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0X_uILApgL0C&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=bbc%20rhodesia%20francistown&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=bbc%20rhodesia%20francistown&amp;f=false ''Radio and Television Broadcasting on the European Continent''], Burton Paulu, University of Minnesota Press, 1967, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the BBC ceased broadcasting from Francistown, and the relay station was transferred to the government of Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22BBC+closed+down+the+transmitter+and+handed+it+over+to+the+Botswana+government+in+1968%22 ''The Politics of International Telecommunications Regulation''], James G.

The RBC operated two main services, the English-language General Service (or National Network),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=633bAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Radio+Rhodesia%22&amp;dq=%22Radio+Rhodesia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAztzbsNPWAhUKVRoKHZ3qBOEQ6AEIMTAC ''World Radio &amp; TV Handbook''], Oluf Lund-Johansen, Cardfont Publishers under license from Billboard Publications., 1973, &lt;/ref&gt; aimed at the white audience, and the African Service, broadcasting in English, Shona and Ndebele, aimed at black listeners. The RBC also established three community stations with a multi-racial audience, Radio Jacaranda (Salisbury), Radio Matopos (Bulawayo) and Radio Manica (Umtali).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pLx1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Radio+Jacaranda%22+%22RBC%22&amp;dq=%22Radio+Jacaranda%22+%22RBC%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_5CzrdPWAhVK1BoKHfkDDxMQ6AEIKDAA ''Black List: The Concise and Comprehensive Reference Guide to Black Journalism, Radio, and Television, Educational and Cultural Organizations in the USA, Africa, and the Caribbean''], Volume 2, Black List, 1975, page 286&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, an [[Ndebele language (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele language]] service operating out of [[Bulawayo]], known as Radio Mthwakazi, was established, using the "Big Bertha" transmitter previously used to jam the BBC's broadcasts from Francistown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=One+example+of+this+divide-and-rule+focus+in+broadcasting+was+the+setting+up+of+an+%27Ndebele+station%27+(Radio+Mthwakazi)+in+the+Bulawayo+area+in+1975,+utilizing+the+powerful+%27Big+Bertha%27+transmitter,+which+had+previously+been+used+to+jam+the&amp;num=30&amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enGB751GB751&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=bks&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=662 ''Broadcasting and Political Change in Zimbabwe 1931-1984''], James Joseph Zaffiro - 1984, page 74&lt;/ref&gt;   
   
As armed opposition to white minority rule mounted in the 1970s, Africans in Rhodesia increasingly began to turn to [[short wave]] radio broadcasts from neighbouring countries, which carried programmes from exiled nationalist movements, with the [[Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front)|Zimbabwe African National Union]]'s Voice of Zimbabwe operating from [[Mozambique]], and the rival [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]]'s Voice of the Revolution operating from [[Zambia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uLenDhrLQ8oC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;ots=3LG9ihNew5&amp;dq=Zimbabwe%20African%20People's%20Union's%20Voice%20of%20the%20Revolution%20operating%20from%20Zambia.&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=Zimbabwe%20African%20People's%20Union's%20Voice%20of%20the%20Revolution%20operating%20from%20Zambia.&amp;f=false ''Making sense of cultural nationalism and the politics of commemoration under the Third Chimurenga in Zimbabwe''], Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni and Wendy Willems, ''Journal of Southern African Studies'', 35 (4). pp. 945-965&lt;/ref&gt;  

In order to counter this, the RBC installed an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] network, while the government distributed FM-only receivers to chiefs and village headmen in the Tribal Trust Lands.&lt;ref name="Africa Today"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It also ran campaigns promoting FM-only receivers, pointing out that they were exempt from the annual [[licence fee]], and how short wave broadcasts were affected by [[noise (radio)|static noise]] and required retuning between frequencies throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kpmyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22rhodesian+broadcasting+corporation%22+%22licence+fee%22&amp;dq=%22rhodesian+broadcasting+corporation%22+%22licence+fee%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN04PtgNPWAhXC1hoKHRqCD9sQ6AEIKDAA ''International Journal''], Volume 42, Canadian Institute of International Affairs, 1987, page 346&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to independence===
In [[1979]], following the adoption of a new constitution, Rhodesia was renamed [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]], and in common with other state institutions which were renamed, the state broadcaster was renamed the Zimbabwe Rhodesia Broadcasting Corporation (ZRBC) or the Voice of Zimbabwe Rhodesia (VZR).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AsZNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Voice+of+Zimbabwe+Rhodesia%22&amp;dq=%22Voice+of+Zimbabwe+Rhodesia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijze6U5NLWAhVL1hoKHcoPD7oQ6AEILTAB ''World Radio TV Handbook''], Billboard Publications, 1980, page 185&lt;/ref&gt; This also saw the debut of Mandy Mundawarara, the country's first black television newsreader, whose father, Silas Mundawarara, had become Deputy Prime Minister in the government of [[Abel Muzorewa]].&lt;ref name="WP1980"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the Muzorewa government did not gain international recognition, and under the terms of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], the country officially reverted to British rule as "Southern Rhodesia", with [[Christopher Soames, Baron Soames|Lord Soames]] as [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia|Governor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rTDvVo52tEAC&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;ots=RBUrvvu_Sa&amp;dq=%22Constitution%20of%20Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia%22&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Constitution%20of%20Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia%22&amp;f=true ''Collective Responses to Illegal Acts in International Law: United Nations Action in the Question of Southern Rhodesia''], Vera Gowlland-Debbas

A number of other senior BBC staff were sent to the country to advise Lord Soames on election broadcasting, and also help the ZRBC with their preparations for independence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1394002/Austen-Kark.html Obituary: Austen Kark], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 13 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to elections being held in February 1980, the Governor's Information Adviser held discussions with the ZRBC, leading the Election Commissioner agreed to a scheme to ensure that all parties standing in the elections should have equal free time on the public media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jVENAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Zimbabwe+Rhodesia+Broadcasting+Corporation%22&amp;dq=%22Zimbabwe+Rhodesia+Broadcasting+Corporation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLjYrk5dLWAhWHNhoKHdZSBVIQ6AEIWjAK Southern Rhodesia: Independence Elections 1980: Report of the Election Commissioner Sir John Boynton, MC, Salisbury, March 1980], John K.

Following independence, the state broadcaster became the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HqpAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Rhodesia+Broadcasting+Corporation+has+become+Zimbabwe+Broadcasting+Corporation%22&amp;dq=%22Rhodesia+Broadcasting+Corporation+has+become+Zimbabwe+Broadcasting+Corporation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj__er13NHWAhUGElAKHUHVB2EQ6AEIKDAA ''EBU Review: Radio and television programmes, administration, law''], Volume 31, Administrative Office of the European Broadcasting Union, 1980, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; In a reflection of the news [[ZANU PF]] government's political leanings, [[Robert Mugabe]], previously described only as "a terrorist leader", was now described as "[[Prime Minister of Zimbabwe|Comrade Prime Minister]]".&lt;ref name="WP1980"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/06/01/zimbabwes-news-media-change-tune-under-black-rule/b67c6c36-b778-41c0-8db2-db1b61b30b7d/ Zimbabwe's News Media Change Tune Under Black Rule], ''[[Washington Post]]'', June 1, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most of the white staff left ZBC after independence, and many of the black staff who replaced them had previously worked in for radio services operated by the nationalist movements from exile in [[Zambia]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TMX3_raXHDcC&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=zbc%20monopoly%201997&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The dual legacy of democracy and authoritarianism], Helge Ronning and Tawana Kupe, in ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TMX3_raXHDcC&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=zbc%20monopoly%201997&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false De-Westernizing Media Studies]'', editors James Curran, Myung-Jin Park, Routledge, 5 Jul 2005, page 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio services were reorganised, with three distinct networks being established: Radio One, the main English-language network, run by Africans but with some whites in key positions, Radio Two, combining the Harare and Radio Mthwakazi services and broadcasting in [[Shona language|Shona]] and [[Ndebele language (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]], and Radio Three, replacing Radio Jacaranda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-SMoAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Radio+Mthwakazi&amp;dq=Radio+Mthwakazi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4ovnCktPWAhXJmBoKHd-EAAMQ6AEITjAI ''Proceedings of the African Women's Features Services Workshop, Marandellas, Zimbabwe, 12-23 October, 1981''], UNESCO Regional Population Communication Unit for Africa, page 60&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Four was established in 1982, as an educational channel.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)#British and international responses; sanctions|economic sanctions]] meant that ZBC inherited antiquated equipment with spares difficult to obtain, as manufacturers no longer produced [[black and white television]] transmission equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n4i2AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Zimbabwe%22+%22TV%22++%22black+and+white%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22black+and+white+TV+transmission+equipment%22 ''Zimbabwe- The First Decade''], Elias Rusike, Roblaw Publishers, 1990, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the television service, now known as ZTV, only reached only 32 percent of the country's territory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=proWAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ZTV+is+composed+of+one+black-and-white+TV+channel+which+covers+32+percent+of+the+country%27s+territory%22&amp;dq=%22ZTV+is+composed+of+one+black-and-white+TV+channel+which+covers+32+percent+of+the+country%27s+territory%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEubvb0tHWAhVCZlAKHeXuBWIQ6AEIKDAA ''Country Market Survey''], Department of Commerce, Industry and Trade Administration., 1982, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

The conversion to [[colour television]] began in late 1982, using the [[PAL#PAL-B/G/D/K/I|PAL B]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b0kNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22conversion+of+the+black+and+white+television+service+to+colour+on+the+PAL+B+System%22&amp;dq=%22conversion+of+the+black+and+white+television+service+to+colour+on+the+PAL+B+System%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEmL7z1tHWAhXRY1AKHWm2DakQ6AEIKDAA ''International TV &amp; Video Guide''], Tantivy Press, 1985, page 204&lt;/ref&gt; Colour transmissions were finally introduced in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=nEsYVfK3MtbWavGogpAO&amp;id=2MhBAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=zbc+tv+colour+1984&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Colour+transmission ''A Concise Encyclopedia of Zimbabwe''], Donatus Bonde, Mambo Press, 1988, page 410&lt;/ref&gt; As much of the machinery had been in used for over two decades, and was now obsolete, it proved more economical to buy entirely new equipment than to replace it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6xwxAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+old+black-and-white+machinery%22&amp;dq=%22the+old+black-and-white+machinery%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC-Miq1NHWAhVFmbQKHcK2ANIQ6AEIKDAA ''Africa Calls from Zimbabwe''], Issues 131-138, Africa Calls Publishers, 1982, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; A second television channel, available only in [[Harare]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rkm7AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Zimbabwe+Broadcasting+Corporation%22+%22second%22+%22TV%22+%22channel%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Harare+area%22 ''Children and Women in Zimbabwe: A Situation Analysis, Update 1994''], Unicef, 1994, page 40&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pDwIAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Zimbabwe+Broadcasting+Corporation%22+%22second%22+%22TV%22+%22channel%22+%221986%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22In+1986%2C+ZBC+installed+a+second+channel%22 ''Africa Film &amp; TV''], Z Promotions, 2001, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Local programming===
At independence, 30 per cent of television programming was locally produced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xQBbVfPukGMC&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=zbc%20tv%20programme%20imports%2030%20per%20cent%20local&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=zbc%20tv%20programme%20imports%2030%20per%20cent%20local&amp;f=false ''Zimbabwe's Cinematic Arts: Language, Power, Identity''], Katrina Daly Thompson, Indiana University Press, 2013, page 51&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1982, local programmes accounted for 40 per cent of output.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AiAoAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22colour+television%22+ZBC&amp;dq=%22colour+television%22+ZBC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmleip69TWAhUSalAKHbZ1BkIQ6AEIRjAH ''Report of Second Meeting of Monitoring Group on Follow-up to Intergovernmental Conference on Communication Policies in Africa: Harare, Zimbabwe, 26-29 October 1982''], AFRICOM Monitoring Group. Meeting, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 1982, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; While some programming was in Shona and Ndebele, 80 per cent of programming was in English, of which most was imported, mainly from the US, Britain and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rkm7AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=zbc+tv+programme+imports+africa&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Most+of+these%2C+except+for+news+and+current+affairs+programmes%2C+are+imported+British%2C+Australian%2C+or+American+shows%22 ''Children and Women in Zimbabwe: A Situation Analysis, Update 1994''], Unicef 1994, page 41&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this reliance on foreign content, in the 1980s, the locally produced drama ''The Mukadota Family'' became the most popular programme in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0KIR8RucnDYC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=mukadota%20family&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=mukadota%20family&amp;f=false ''How "American" Is Globalization?''], William Marling, JHU Press, 2006, page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1957 Broadcasting Act remained in force, ZBC inherited RBC's state monopoly on broadcasting, remaining accountable to the country's Minister of Information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uRZDAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=zbc+monopoly+broadcasting+act+1957&amp;dq=zbc+monopoly+broadcasting+act+1957&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjExo3r7tXWAhWLmbQKHetqD6IQ6AEIQzAF ''Media, democracy and development''], Elin W. Andersen, Dept. of Media and Communication, University of Oslo, 1997, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; Expressing his dislike of independent broadcasting in 1995, [[Robert Mugabe]], by now [[President of Zimbabwe|President]], remarked "you do not know what propaganda a non-state radio station might broadcast".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=39r6W47zNsyBgAbzy4vQAQ&amp;q=%22you+do+not+know+what+propaganda+a+non-state+radio+station+might+broadcast%22&amp;oq=%22you+do+not+know+what+propaganda+a+non-state+radio+station+might+broadcast%22&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...9458.9458.0.10088.1.1.0.0.0.0.85.85.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.aeErTgLYx3I ''Critical Analysis of the Media Law in Zimbabwe''], Nkosi Ndlela, Media Institute of Southern Africa. Zimbabwe Chapter, Konrad Adenauer Foundation, 2003, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Government of Zimbabwe|government]] announced that the ZBC monopoly on broadcasting would be abolished by the end of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9PcEULjohrUC&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;ots=NZTm-75_hY&amp;dq=zbc%20monopoly&amp;pg=PA396#v=onepage&amp;q=zbc%20monopoly&amp;f=false Zimbabwe], Øyvind Thiis and Geoff Feltoe, in [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9PcEULjohrUC&amp;dq=zbc+monopoly&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''International Human Rights in Developing Countries Yearbook 1997''], editors Hugo Stokke, Astri Suhrke, Arne Tostensen, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1998, page 396&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result, the ZBC's second TV channel was discontinued and replaced by Joy TV, the country's first independent channel, which operated on a lease agreement with the ZBC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ypFWqOJFKPEC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=joy+tv+zimbabwe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fX0tP1X4ZL&amp;sig=m7JorC7v1hYI5bUA0C9YoBmKyXY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0k4YVfvUHIGtPZiGgLAH&amp;ved=0CG0Q6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=joy%20tv%20zimbabwe&amp;f=true ''Culture and Customs of Zimbabwe''], Oyekan Owomoyela, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, page 58&lt;/ref&gt; This channel lasted until 2002, when it was controversially taken off the air for allegedly violating the Broadcasting Services Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category.php/media/8085 Zimbabwe: CURTAIN COMES DOWN ON JOY TV], ''Pambazuka'', 6 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of pro-government bias===
In 2015, [[Freedom House]] described ZBC coverage as overwhelmingly favouring the ruling [[ZANU-PF]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/zimbabwe Zimbabwe Freedom of the Press], [[Freedom House]], 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a study conducted by the Media Monitoring Project of Zimbabwe (MMPZ) in 2003 showed that one of the propaganda jingles, ''Rambai Makashinga'' or "Continue Persevering", was being played 288 times a day on the four ZBC radio stations, and 72 times a day on ZBC television.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LJbFniZhtDQC&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Zimbabwe%20Broadcasting%20Corporation%20censorship&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q=Zimbabwe%20Broadcasting%20Corporation%20censorship&amp;f=false ''Zimbabwe: A Survey''], African Minds, 2009, page 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
The ZBC has five radio networks, which are ZBC National FM, broadcasting news and current affairs in [[English language|English]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalfm.co.zw/ National FM]&lt;/ref&gt; ZBC Radio Zimbabwe broadcasts programming in [[Shona language|Shona]] and [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiozim.co.zw/ Radio Zimbabwe]&lt;/ref&gt; Power FM, broadcasting pop music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerfm.co.zw/ Power FM]&lt;/ref&gt;, Classic 263 (formerly Sport FM) carrying sports news.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfm.co.zw/ SFM]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bulawayo]] based Khulumani FM, broadcasting is languages that are mainly spoke in the Matabeleland Region.

==Television==
ZBC's television service now consists of a single channel, known as ZBC TV. The ZBC re-established a second TV channel of its own, Channel 2, in April 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201004130289.html Zimbabwe: ZBC to Launch Channel Two], ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|The Herald]]'', 13 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but this station was decommissioned in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailynews.co.zw/articles/2015/08/12/zbc-fires-hundreds-closes-tv-station ZBC fires hundreds, closes TV station], ''[[Daily News (Zimbabwe)|Daily News]]'', 12 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

News bulletins include the morning ''Good Morning Zimbabwe'', produced by Admire Mhungu, lunchtime news, ''Nhau Indaba'' and ''News Hour''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zbc.co.zw/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=546&amp;Itemid=99  ZBC-TV Programme Line Up]&lt;/ref&gt; Rumbidzai Takawira, the anchor, is usually the host of ''News Hour''.
