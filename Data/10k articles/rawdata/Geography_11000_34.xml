[[Image:Alaskan ADIZ.jpg|thumb|300px|right|ADIZ boundaries for Alaska.]]
The '''Air Defense Identification Zone''' ('''ADIZ''') is an area surrounding much of [[North America]] – namely [[airspace]] surrounding the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] – in which the ready identification, location, and control of [[civil aviation|civil aircraft]] over land or water is required in the interest of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=cfr&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2003-title14-vol2/pdf/CFR-2003-title14-vol2-chapI-subchapF.pdf Code of Federal Regulations: 14 CFR Part 99 - Security Control of Air Traffic]&lt;/ref&gt;  This ADIZ is jointly administered by the civilian air traffic control authorities and the militaries of both nations, under the auspices of the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)]].  The [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]] handles the requests of international aircraft and [[Transport Canada]] handles Canadian requests. Any aircraft flying in these zones without authorization may be identified as a threat and treated as an enemy aircraft, potentially leading to interception by [[fighter aircraft]].

An aircraft entering an ADIZ is required to radio its planned course, destination, and any additional details about its trip through the ADIZ to a higher authority, typically an [[air traffic controller]].  The aircraft must also be equipped with a radar [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]].

==History==
With the outbreak of [[World War II]], the United States asserted control of coastal airspace in 1940,&lt;ref name="winkler"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/airdef/searching_the_skies.htm Searching the Skies: The Legacy of the United States Cold War Defense Radar Program], David F. Winkler, United States Air Force Air Combat Command, June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and this took on a sense of urgency after the Japanese attack at [[Pearl Harbor]].  However, by 1943 the [[Axis powers]] no longer posed a severe threat to the safety of North America.  With the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the Air Force placed its forces on alert and uncovered major weaknesses in the coordination of domestic defense units.&lt;ref name="winkler" /&gt;  An air defense command and control structure was developed in 1950, creating five Air Defense Identification Zones around North America.  If radio interrogation failed to identify an aircraft in the ADIZ, the Air Force launched interceptor aircraft to identify the intruder visually.  The air defense system reached its peak in 1962, however with the deployment of the [[R-7 Semyorka|SS-6]] [[ICBM]] in the USSR, strategic threats shifted overwhelmingly to ICBM attacks, and bomber intrusions were considered to be less of a threat.

The ADIZ was focused on aircraft approaching primarily from the [[Soviet Union]], but on October 26, 1971, a Cuban aircraft landed in New Orleans after flying completely undetected through American airspace.&lt;ref&gt;"The Gaps in Our Defense", Claude Witze, Air Force magazine (March 1972), pp. 33-39.66.&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity and political pressure from Louisiana Congressman [[Felix Edward Hébert]] forced the Air Force to establish the Southeast Air Defense Sector and open a radar network along the Gulf coast.  In the 1980s with the rise of the [[War on Drugs]], this ADIZ took on a dual role of controlling drug smuggling from Latin America.

The role of the ADIZ diminished significantly in the 1990s with political changes in Russia and the reduction and attrition of Russian strategic aviation forces, but gained renewed importance during the following decade in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], in which long-range aircraft on domestic flights were used against domestic targets – the renewed importance placed on the ADIZ was despite the fact that none of the aircraft involved in the September 11 attacks crossed the ADIZ.

==United States==
The United States formally defines an ADIZ in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]: 14 CFR Part 99.&lt;ref name="cfr" /&gt; The ADIZ forms a transition zone in which aircraft come under positive identification and control by air traffic and defense authorities.  With regards to applicability of the law, {{CodeFedReg|14|99|1|a}} states "This subpart prescribes rules for operating civil aircraft in a defense area, or into, within, or out of the United States through an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), designated in subpart B".

Moreover, the U.S. Navy's ''Commander's Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations'' states the ADIZ applies only to commercial aircraft intending to enter U.S. sovereign airspace, with a basis in international law of "the right of a nation to establish reasonable conditions of entry into its territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/a9b8e92d-2c8d-4779-9925-0defea93325c/1-14M_%28Jul_2007%29_%28NWP|title= The Commander's Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations|date= July 2007|publisher= Department of the Navy Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manual specifically instructs U.S. military aircraft to ignore the ADIZ of other states when operating in coastal areas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The United States does not recognize the right of a coastal nation to apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter national airspace nor does the United States apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter U.S. airspace. Accordingly, U.S. military aircraft not intending to enter national airspace should not identify themselves or otherwise comply with ADIZ procedures established by other nations, unless the United States has specifically agreed to do so. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A U.S. Air Force university dissertation states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These regulations do not pertain to military aircraft, but to enter US airspace, without inducing the scrambling of fighter interceptors, these rules must be complied with and followed. The US does not claim sovereignty over these zones per se, but does closely monitor and request information of all objects entering the zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/acsc/01-034.pdf|title= Sovereignty and Protective Zones in Space and the Appropriate Command and Control of Assets|author = Richard J. Butler, Major, USAF|date= April 2001|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2008 [[United States Northern Command]] commander [[Victor E. Renuart, Jr.]] said that although "we never let an unidentified aircraft come into our airspace" in a "post-9/11 world" and "determine who they are and what they’re doing," "if it is a Russian aircraft on a training mission, we allow them to continue to do their job."&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Scarborough (June 26, 2008) [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/26/russian-flights-smack-of-cold-war/ Russian flights smack of Cold War] ''[[The Washington Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The joint US/Canadian ADIZ, which is almost exclusively over water,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-rac-2-0-2599.htm#2-13 Transport Canada AIM, RAC 2.13 – Canadian ADIZ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218033451/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-rac-2-0-2599.htm |date=2011-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a national defense boundary for aerial incursions. Any aircraft that wishes to fly in or through the boundary must file either a [[DVFR|Defense Visual Flight Rules]] (DVFR) flight plan or an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan before crossing the ADIZ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/regserv/cars/part6-602-2436.htm#602_145 Canadian Air Regulations 602.145 – ADIZ Operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919144314/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/regserv/cars/part6-602-2436.htm |date=2012-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft must have an operational radar transponder and maintain two-way radio contact while approaching and crossing the North American ADIZ.

== Guam ==
The Federal regulation governing ADIZ areas also provides for an ADIZ around [[Guam]].  Though like [[Puerto Rico]] it is an unincorporated [[Territories of the United States|United States territory]], the island is home to [[Andersen Air Force Base]], which is one of two major [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] strategic bomber bases in the Asia Pacific region, the other being [[Diego Garcia]] which is actually on British territory.

== Washington, D.C.==
The [[Washington, DC Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules Area|Washington Air Defense Identification Zone]] (surrounds the [[Washington metropolitan area|National Capital Region]], which is composed of counties of states in the immediate vicinity of the District of Columbia, plus the city of Baltimore) was created in 2003 though some sources refer to it as being created in response to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th attacks]]. The reason for this confusion is that there are two other sets of flight restrictions over Washington, D.C. besides the DC ADIZ ( Washington, DC Metropolitan Area Flight Restricted Zone, FRZ, &amp; Special Federal Aviation Regulation 94, SFAR 94 or just plain Special Flight Rules Area, a zone which envelopes general aviation airports centered around Ronald Reagan airport)
established for the purpose  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Michael|title=Airspace Obstacles and TFR Trivia - A Pilot’s Guide to Understanding Restrictions in Today’s National Airspace System|url=http://www.faa.gov/pilots/safety/notams_tfr/media/tfrweb.pdf|website=faa.gov |publisher=FAA Aviation News|accessdate=14 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620044007/http://www.faa.gov/pilots/safety/notams_tfr/media/tfrweb.pdf|archivedate=20 June 2014|page=4|format=PDF|date=November–December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ADIZ, however, shared none of the regulatory similarity with the border area ADIZes.  This airspace was subsequently renamed the DC Flight Restricted Zone and Special Flight Rules Area to avoid confusion.

'''Behm Bank''' ({{Coord|76|21|S|30|0|W}}) is an [[undersea bank]] in the [[Weddell Sea]] named for [[Alexander Behm]], the inventor in 1912–13 of an electronic sounding apparatus. The name was proposed by Dr. [[Heinrich Hinze]] of the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], [[Bremerhaven, Germany]], and approved by the [[Advisory Committee for Undersea Features]] in June 1997.

The '''''Chronicles of Huayang''''' or '''''Huayang Guo Zhi''''' is the oldest extant [[gazetteer]] of a region of [[China]]. It was compiled by [[Chang Qu]] during the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]]. It contains roughly 110,000 characters. Its contents comprise history, geography and individuals of its region. It was used by the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] historian [[Pei Songzhi]] in his annotations to the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', and by the [[Tang Dynasty]] prince [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xian]] when he wrote his commentaries on the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]''.

The ''Chronicles of Huayang'' is also rendered in English as:
* ''Annals of Huayang Country''
* ''Huayang National Annals''
* ''Records of the States South of [[Mount Hua]]''
* ''Annals of the Kingdoms South of Mount Hua''

[[Hong Liangji]] said that ''Chronicles of Huayang'' is one of the oldest extant Chinese gazetteers, along with the ''Yue Jue Shu'' (越絶書).

In [[Ireland]], [[city|the term ''city'']] has somewhat differing meanings in [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

Historically, [[city status in the United Kingdom]], and before that in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], was a ceremonial designation. It carried more prestige than the alternative municipal titles "[[borough]]", "[[town]]" and "[[township]]", but gave no extra legal powers. This remains the case in Northern Ireland, which is still part of the [[United Kingdom]]. In the Republic of Ireland, "city" has an additional designation [[local government in the Republic of Ireland|in local government]].

==History up to 1920==
Before the [[Partition of Ireland]] in 1920–22, the island formed a single jurisdiction in which "city" had a common history.

The first edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' s.v. ''city'' (published 1893), explains that in England, from the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the word was applied to towns with [[List of cathedrals in the United Kingdom#Church of England|Church of England cathedrals]]. It goes on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of the word in Ireland is somewhat parallel. Probably all or most of the places having bishops have been styled on some occasion ''civitas''; but some of these are mere hamlets, and the term 'city' is currently applied only to a few of them which are ancient and important boroughs. [[Thom's Directory]] applies it to [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Derry]], [[Limerick]] ('City of [[Treaty of Limerick|the violated treaty]]'), [[Kilkenny]], and [[Waterford]]; also to [[Armagh]] and [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]], but not to [[Tuam]] or [[Galway]] (though the latter is often called 'the City of [[Tribes of Galway|the Tribes]]'). [[Belfast]] was, in 1888, created a 'city' by Royal Letters Patent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Cathair''===
In most European languages, there is no distinction between "city" and "town", with the same word translating both English words; for example, ''ville'' in French, or ''Stadt'' in German.

In [[Modern Irish]], "city" is translated ''cathair''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focal.ie/AdvSearch.aspx?wording=city&amp;extent=complete&amp;length=both&amp;lang=1&amp;posL2=5&amp;posLX=5&amp;domain=0&amp;collection=0 |title=city |work=[[Focal (lexicographical website)|Focal]] |accessdate=16 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "town" is translated ''baile'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focal.ie/AdvSearch.aspx?wording=town&amp;extent=complete&amp;length=both&amp;lang=1&amp;posL2=0&amp;posLX=5&amp;domain=0&amp;collection=0 |title=town |work=[[Focal (lexicographical website)|Focal]] |accessdate=16 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this is a recent convention; previously ''baile'' was applied to any settlement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dil.ie/results-list.asp?mode=ADV&amp;searchText=%20baile&amp;HIGH=%20baile&amp;respage=0&amp;resperpage=1&amp;Fuzzy=0&amp;bhcp=1|title=baile|work=Electronic Dictionary of the Irish Language|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|accessdate=17 May 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''cathair'' meant a walled or stone [[fortress]], [[monastery]], or city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dil.ie/results-list.asp?mode=ADV&amp;searchText=%20cathair&amp;HIGH=%20cathair&amp;respage=0&amp;resperpage=1&amp;Fuzzy=0&amp;bhcp=1|title=cathair|work=Electronic Dictionary of the Irish Language|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|accessdate=17 May 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Dublin, long the metropolis of the island, has been called ''Baile Átha Cliath'' since the fifteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/Eolas/Data/Brainse/Dublin.pdf |page=6 |format=PDF |title=Dublin, the history of the placename |publisher=The Placenames Branch |language=Irish, English |accessdate=16 May 2010 |quote=The element baile, 'town', was prefixed to the name some time in the 15th century |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614200352/http://www.logainm.ie/eolas/Data/Brainse/Dublin.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while its earliest city charter is from 1172.&lt;ref name="comm1835-dub"/&gt; The Irish text of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] translates "city of Dublin" as ''cathair Bhaile Átha Chliath'',&lt;ref name="Cearúil"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.constitution.ie/Documents/Bunreacht%20na%20hEireann%20-%20Study%20of%20the%20Irish%20Text.pdf |accessdate=9 September 2013 |format=PDF|last1=Ó Cearúil|first1=Micheál |last2=Ó Murchú|first2=Máirtín |others=for the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution|title= Bunreacht na hÉireann: A study of the Irish text|year=1999|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Dublin |isbn=0-7076-6400-4|pages=172–3, 225–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining the modern sense of ''cathair'' with the historic sense of ''Baile''.  Conversely, the original Irish names of such smaller settlements as [[Cahir]], [[Cahirciveen]], [[Caherdaniel]], or [[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]] (''Cathair na Mart'') use ''cathair'' in the older sense.

===''Civitas''===
{{See also|List of cathedrals in Ireland}}
In the [[Roman Empire]], the Latin ''[[civitas]]'' referred originally to the jurisdiction of a capital town, typically the territory of a single conquered tribe.&lt;ref name="Galinie"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Vauchez|editor1-first=André|editor2-last=Dobson|editor2-first=Richard Barrie|editor3-last=Lapidge|editor3-first=Michael|first=Henri|last=Galinié|title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtgotOF0MKQC&amp;pg=PA313|accessdate=17 May 2010|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-57958-282-1|page=313|chapter=''Civitas'', City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it came to mean the capital town itself.&lt;ref name="Galinie"/&gt; When [[Gallo-Roman culture#Christianity|Christianity was organised in Gaul]], each [[diocese]] was the territory of a tribe, and each bishop resided in the ''civitas''.&lt;ref name="Galinie"/&gt; Thus ''civitas'' came to mean the site of a cathedral.&lt;ref name="Galinie"/&gt; This usage carried over generally to [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''cité'' and English ''city'' in England. [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' of 1765&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30802/30802-h/30802-h.htm#Page_111 |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England |volume=1 |chapter=Introduction §4: Of the Countries subject to the Laws of England |first=William |last=Blackstone |page=111 |year=1765 |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |location=Oxford |accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; cites [[Edward Coke]]'s ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' of 1634:&lt;ref name="CokeLittleton1853"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coke|first1=Edward|authorlink1=Edward Coke|last2=Hale|first2=Matthew|authorlink2=Matthew Hale (jurist)|last3=Nottingham|first3=Heneage Finch, Earl of |authorlink3=Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham|author4=Francis Hargrave, Charles Butler|title=A commentary upon Littleton |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOgKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=17 May 2010|edition=1st American, from 19th London|series=The Institutes of the laws of England|volume=1|year=1853|publisher=R. H. Small|location=Philadelphia |pages=Vol. 1 pp.163–5|nopp=Y|chapter=109b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A city is a town incorporated, which is or hath been the see of a bishop; and though the bishoprick be dissolved, [[Diocese of Westminster (Church of England)|as at Westminster]], yet still it remaineth a city.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Subsequent legal authorities disputed this assertion; pointing out that the [[City of Westminster]] gained its status not implicitly from [[Westminster Abbey|its (former) cathedral]] but explicitly from [[letters patent]] issued by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] shortly after the Diocese was established.&lt;ref name="CokeLittleton1853"/&gt;

In any case it was moot whether the association of ''city'' with dioceses applied to Ireland.  A 1331 writ of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] is addressed, among others, to "Civibus civitatis Dublin, —de Droghda, – de Waterford, de Cork, – de Limrik" implying ''civitas'' status for [[Drogheda]].&lt;ref&gt;Gale 1834, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQSAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR252 Appendix p.cclii]&lt;/ref&gt; Some credence to the episcopal connection was given by the 1835 Report of the Commissioners into Municipal Corporations in Ireland&lt;ref name="Armagh-burgesses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuam-burgesses"/&gt; and the 1846 ''Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland'' (see [[#ParlGazz|below]]).

Whereas the Normans moved many English sees from a rural location to a regional hub, the cathedrals of the established [[Church of Ireland]] remained at the often rural sites agreed at the twelfth-century [[Synod of Rathbreasail]] and [[Synod of Kells]].  The [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Roman Catholic church in Ireland]] had no cathedrals during the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

[[Downpatrick]] is noted as "the City of Down" is a 1403 record, although no granting instrument is known.&lt;ref name="comm1835-downpatrick"/&gt; The Corporation was defunct by 1661, when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] initiated plans to revive it, which were not completed.&lt;ref name="comm1835-downpatrick"/&gt;

Although the charter of  [[Clogher]] did not describe it as a city, the [[borough constituency]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]] was officially called "[[Clogher (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|City of Clogher]]".&lt;ref name="comm1835-Clogher"&gt;Rep Comm Mun Corp Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=YdVbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA997 pp.997–998]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[pocket borough]] of the [[Bishop of Clogher]], disestablished by the [[Acts of Union 1800]].&lt;ref name="comm1835-Clogher"/&gt;

John Caillard Erck records of [[Old Leighlin]], "So flourishing indeed was this town in subsequent times, that it received the appellation of the city of Leighlin, and was inhabited by eighty-six burgesses during the prelacy of Richard Rocomb, who died in 1420."&lt;ref name="Erck1827"&gt;{{cite book|last=Erck|first=John Caillard|title=The ecclesiastical register: containing the names of the dignitaries and parochial clergy of Ireland : as also of the parishes and their respective patrons and an account of monies granted for building churches and glebe-houses with ecclesiastical annals annexed to each diocese and appendixes : containing among other things several cases of quare impedit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXcrAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=14 May 2010|year=1827|publisher=R. Milliken and Son|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal charters===
For seven settlements in Ireland (listed [[#List|below]]), the title "city" was historically conferred by the awarding of a [[royal charter]] which used the word "city" in the name of the [[body corporate]] charged with governing the settlement. (In fact, charters were for centuries written in Latin, with ''civitas'' denoting "city" and ''villa'' "town".) [[Armagh]] had no charter recognising it as a city but claimed the title by [[Custom (law)|prescription]]; acts of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] in 1773 and 1791 refer to the "city of Armagh".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qub.ac.uk/ild/?func=display_bill&amp;id=3048 13 &amp; 14 George III c.40] and [http://www.qub.ac.uk/ild/?func=display_bill&amp;id=2306 31 George III c.46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The label "city" carried prestige but was purely ceremonial and did not in practice affect the municipal government.  However, a section of the [[Newtown Act]] of 1748&lt;ref&gt;21 Geo. II c.10 s.8&lt;/ref&gt; allowed for members of a Corporation to be non-resident of its municipality in the case of "any town corporate or borough, not being a city".&lt;ref name="comm-1747"&gt;Rept Comm Mun Corp Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=c9VbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 pp.19–20]&lt;/ref&gt; This was enacted because there were too few Protestants in smaller towns to make up the numbers.&lt;ref name="comm-1747"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Malcomson |first=A.

In fact, non-residents had served on both corporations.&lt;ref name="Armagh-burgesses"&gt;Rep Comm Mun Corp Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=lksSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA671 p.671–2 "City of Armagh" §10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuam-burgesses"&gt;Rep Comm Mun Corp Irl [http://pdf.library.soton.ac.uk/EPPI/13040-7.pdf#page=14 p.432 "Borough of Tuam" §13]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one reference in [[James VI and I|James I]]'s 1609 charter for [[Wexford]] to "our said city of Wexford", but the rest of the charter describes it as a town or borough.&lt;ref&gt;Gale 1834, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQSAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR83 Appendix 27: Translation from enrolment in Chancery of the charter to the town of Wexford by James the First; pp.83–4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the Union===
After the [[Acts of Union 1800]], Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], and British law governed the award and removal of the title "city".

The [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]] abolished both those corporations which were already ''de facto'' defunct and those which were most egregiously unrepresentative. The latter category included Armagh and Cashel. It was moot whether these ''ipso facto'' were no longer cities; some later sources continued to describe them as such.

Prior to the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]], eight Irish municipalities were [[county corporate|counties corporate]].  This was distinct from being a city. Five of the eight were "County of the City", the other three being "County of the Town". The other cities —[[Derry]], and until 1840 Cashel and Armagh— were not governed separately from their surrounding counties; however, the official name of [[County Londonderry]] was for long "the City and County of Londonderry".

====The ''Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland''====
{{anchor|ParlGazz}}
The 1846 ''Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland'' uses the label "city" in a variety of ways.

[[Armagh]] is defined as "[a] post, market, and ancient town, a [[royal borough]], the capital of a county, and the [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|ecclesiastical metropolis]] of Ireland"; however it is called a "city" throughout its article.&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=9rblf03SdkYC&amp;pg=PA78 Vol.1 p.78 "Armagh"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]] is treated similarly to Armagh.&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=9rblf03SdkYC&amp;pg=PA342 Vol.1 p.342 "Cashel"] "A post and market town, a borough, an episcopal city, and the ecclesiastical metropolis of the southern province of Ireland"&lt;/ref&gt; For other episcopal seats, "city" is not used, or used in hedged descriptions like "episcopal city",&lt;ref name="pg-Clogher"&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=9rblf03SdkYC&amp;pg=PA418 Vol.1 p.418 "Clogher"] "An ancient episcopal city and incorporated town, but at present a mere village"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pg-Cloyne"&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=9rblf03SdkYC&amp;pg=PA470 Vol.1 p.470 "Cloyne"] "A market and post town, and an ancient Episcopal city"&lt;/ref&gt; "ancient city",&lt;ref name="pg-Clogher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pg-Cloyne"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=9rblf03SdkYC&amp;pg=PA56 Vol.1 p.56 "Ardfert"] "This ancient and once important city is now a poor and declining village"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iK5_B7W1xIC&amp;pg=PA176 Vol.2 p.176 "Emly"] "Though now a mere village, it is noticed by some ancient historians as in their day a large and flourishing city."&lt;/ref&gt; or "nominal city".&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=9rblf03SdkYC&amp;pg=PA493 Vol.1 p.493 "Connor"] "the farce of nominal city character"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iK5_B7W1xIC&amp;pg=PA77 Vol.2 p.77 "Dromore"] "Though nominally a city, it is really but a small and common-place market-town."&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Kilfenora]] it says, "It belongs to the same category as [[Emly]], [[Clonfert]], [[Kilmacduagh]], [[Ardfert]], [[Connor, County Antrim|Connor]], Clogher, [[Kilmore, County Cavan|Kilmore]], [[Ferns, County Wexford|Ferns]], and [[Achonry]], in exhibiting a shrunk and ghastly caricature upon the practical notion of a 'city;' and nothing but its episcopal name and historical associations prevent it from being regarded as a mean and shabby hamlet."&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iK5_B7W1xIC&amp;pg=PA409 Vol.2 p.409]&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Elphin, County Roscommon|Elphin]] it says "the general tone of at once masonry, manners, and business, is a hideous satire upon the idea of 'a city.'"&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iK5_B7W1xIC&amp;pg=PA174 Vol.2 p.174]&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Downpatrick]] it says "it displays a striking, and almost outré combination of unique and common place character, of ancient piles and modern edifices curiously mingling the features of city and village, of political grandeur and social littleness."&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iK5_B7W1xIC&amp;pg=PA60 Vol.2 p.60]&lt;/ref&gt; There are passing references in other articles to "the city of [[Tuam]]",&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HMuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA398 Vol.3 p.398 "Tuam"] "The Clare and the Dunmore sections contain the city of Tuam"&lt;/ref&gt; and "the city of [[Killaloe, County Clare|Killaloe]]".&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iK5_B7W1xIC&amp;pg=PA552 Vol.2 p.552 "Kincora"] "1 mile north-northwest of the city of Killaloe"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1846 Parl Gaz Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HMuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA251 Vol.3 p.251 "Slieve Bernagh"] "it soars gradually up in the western vicinity of the city of Killaloe"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belfast====
Belfast in 1887 applied to be granted city status on the occasion of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Golden Jubilee]].&lt;ref name="beckett44"&gt;Beckett 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PA44 p.44]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Home Office]] objected to setting a precedent for granting city status to towns not episcopal sees.&lt;ref name="beckett45"&gt;Beckett 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PA45 p.45]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Sexton (Irish politician)|Thomas Sexton]] asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Civil Services |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1887/jul/15/civil-services#column_977 |house=HC |column-start=977 |column-end=978 |date=15 July 1887 |volume=317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;with regard to the granting of the City Charter to Belfast. A Question was lately put in the House upon the subject, and ... [ [[William Henry Smith (1825–1891)|W. H. Smith]]] replied ... that the Government did not intend to recommend any such grant in connection with Her Majesty's Jubilee. ... I will ask him for a reply upon the point ... I do not know that there is much difference between a town and a city; but some people prefer the title of city, and if there is any advantage in a place being called a city, I think the people of Belfast are entitled to have their choice. There are eight cities in Ireland, and Belfast is next to Dublin in point of importance; according to Thom's information, it is the first town of manufacturing importance. I believe there is a strong desire that the title of city should be given to the place. ... It seems absurd that Belfast should be shut out from any City Charter, while Armagh, with 10,000 of a population, is a city; and when Cashell, with a population of 4,000, enjoys the distinction also. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be able to say that, in consideration of the importance of the town, the Government will recommend the Crown to grant to it the title of city. Like civility, a Charter of this kind costs nothing; and, therefore, I think that this Charter might be promptly and gracefully conceded to the town.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1888, the request was granted by [[letters patent]], setting a precedent for non-episcopal cities which was soon emulated by [[Dundee]] and [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckett 2005, pp.45–50&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Lord Mayor" and "Right Honourable"===
{{See also|List of lord mayoralties and lord provostships in the United Kingdom}}
The title [[Lord Mayor]] is given to the mayor of a privileged subset of UK cities. In some cases, a lord mayor additionally has the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] "[[Right Honourable]]".  The [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Mayor of Dublin]] gained the title "lord" by a charter of 1641,&lt;ref name="comm1835-1676"&gt;1835 Rep Comm Mun Corp Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=YdVbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA5 Vol 9 Pt 1 p.5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dcc-mayor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/YOURCOUNCIL/LORDMAYORDUBLIN/HISTORYOFLORDMAYOR/Pages/HistoryLordMayorsOffice.aspx |title=History of the Lord Mayor's Office |publisher=Dublin City Council |accessdate=22 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419070445/http://www.dublincity.ie/YourCouncil/LordMayorDublin/HistoryofLordMayor/Pages/HistoryLordMayorsOffice.aspx |archivedate=19 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Irish Confederate Wars|Confederate Wars]] and their aftermath meant the form "Lord Mayor" was not used till 1665.&lt;ref name="dcc-mayor"/&gt; The style "Right Honourable" was originally a consequence of the Lord Mayor's ''[[ex officio]]'' membership of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]]; it was later explicitly granted by the 1840 Act, and finally abolished by the [[Local Government Act 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Act 2001 §32(3)b&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]] gained the title in 1892 —based on the precedent of [[Dundee]]&lt;ref&gt;Beckett 2005 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PA67 p.67]&lt;/ref&gt;— and the style "Right Honourable" in 1923, in recognition of Belfast's status as capital of the newly created [[Northern Ireland]].

==Northern Ireland==
{{main article|City status in the United Kingdom}}

===Armagh===
After [[Belfast]] received its charter in 1888, no further towns in nine-county [[Ulster]] applied for city status until 1953, when [[Armagh]] began to argue for the restoration of the status lost in 1840.&lt;ref name="beckett133"&gt;Beckett 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PA133 p.133]&lt;/ref&gt; Its justification was that the [[Archbishop of Armagh]] was [[Primate of All Ireland]]. The council used the appellation "city" unofficially until 1994, when [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], announced the status had been granted to mark the 1,550th anniversary of the traditional date of Armagh's foundation by [[Saint Patrick]].&lt;ref name="beckett134"&gt;Beckett 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PA134 p.134]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lisburn and Newry===

[[Lisburn]] and [[Ballymena]] entered a UK-wide competition for city status held to mark the millennium in 2000; neither was selected, being below the unofficial 200,000 population threshold.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett 2005, pp.141–163&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy surrounded the decision-making process for the competition, and as a result the rules changed for a 2002 competition for the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]], with [[Northern Ireland]] guaranteed one new city.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett 2005,[https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PA153 p.153]&lt;/ref&gt; This encouraged more applicants, with Lisburn and Ballymena being joined by [[Carrickfergus]], [[Craigavon]], [[Coleraine]], and [[Newry]].&lt;ref name="beckett-170"/&gt; Surprisingly, Lisburn and Newry were both successful, prompting allegations of political expediency, since Lisburn is strongly [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] and Newry strongly [[Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic]].&lt;ref name="beckett-170"/&gt; Ballymena representatives were aggrieved, and there were claims that Lisburn, as a suburb of Belfast, ought to be ineligible.&lt;ref name="beckett-170"&gt;Beckett 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PA175 p.175]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinn Féin]] members of [[Newry and Mourne District Council]] were opposed to Newry's city status because of the connection to the [[British monarchy]]; other councillors welcomed the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newryandmourne.gov.uk/general_council/pdf/19%20March%202002.pdf |title=D.D.84./2002 – CITY STATUS |date=19 March 2002 |work=Minutes of District Development Committee Meeting |publisher=Newry and Mourne District Council |pages=4–7 |accessdate=23 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic of Ireland==
{{See also|Local government in the Republic of Ireland}}
The [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] abolished the corporate counties of the city of [[Kilkenny]] and the towns of Galway and [[Drogheda]] (and [[Carrickfergus]] in [[Ulster]]). The Act redesignated the other corporate counties as [[county borough]]s. After [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]], four of these were in the [[Irish Free State]], which later became the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Galway was made a fifth county borough in 1985.&lt;ref name="galway-1985"&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1985/en/act/pub/0007/print.html Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985] [[Irish Statute Book]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Local Government Act 2001]] redesignates the five county boroughs as cities.&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Act, 2001 §10(4)(b)&lt;/ref&gt; These cities, like the county boroughs before them, are almost identical in power and function to the [[counties of Ireland|administrative counties]]. The five administrative cities are [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Dublin, [[Galway]], [[Limerick]], and [[Waterford]].&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Act, 2001; Schedule 5, Part 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]] merged [[Limerick City Council]] and [[Limerick County Council]] into [[Limerick City and County Council]], and [[Waterford City Council]] and [[Waterford County Council]] into [[Waterford City and County Council]], with effect from the [[Irish local elections, 2014|2014 local elections]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Galway]]'s status as a city was for long debatable.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PA16 p.16]&lt;/ref&gt; Its nickname was "the city of the Tribes", but in British times it was legally a town, and its [[county corporate]] was the "county of the town of Galway".&lt;ref&gt;Parl Gazz Irl 1846 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iK5_B7W1xIC&amp;pg=PA237 Vol.2 p.237]&lt;/ref&gt; Its 1484 charter grants [[Mayor of Galway|its Corporation's head]] the title of Mayor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galwaycity.ie/AllServices/YourCouncil/HistoryofTheCityCouncil/ |title=History of The City Council |publisher=Galway City Council |accessdate=15 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213052446/http://www.galwaycity.ie/AllServices/YourCouncil/HistoryofTheCityCouncil/ |archivedate=13 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but so did the charters of [[Clonmel]] and [[Drogheda]],&lt;ref&gt;Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, Schedule A&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the charters extinguished in 1840 of [[Carrickfergus]], [[Coleraine]], [[Wexford]], and [[Youghal]],&lt;ref&gt;Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, Schedule B&lt;/ref&gt; none of which claimed the title of "city".

Galway was nevertheless intermittently described as a city; [[John Speed]]'s 1610 map of "[[Connacht|Connaugh]]" includes a plan of "the Citie of Galway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbott|first=T.

Estes &amp; company |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Local Government (Galway) Act, 1937, describes it as the "Town of Galway" and creates a municipal government called the "Borough of Galway".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1937/en/act/prv/0003/print.html Local Government (Galway) Act, 1937] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Aran Islands (Transport) Act, 1936, regulates steamships travelling "between the City of Galway and the [[Aran Islands]]";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1936/en/act/pub/0036/sec0002.html Aran Islands (Transport) Act, 1936 §2 Contracts for steamer service to the Aran Islands.] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt; also, legislators debating the passage of the 1937 Act frequently referred to Galway as a "city".&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/1934/07/11/00003.asp Seanad debates Vol.16 cc.1773–83]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1937/06/09/00010.asp Dáil debates Vol.68 cc.109–112]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the borough was made a [[county borough]] in 1985, the Borough Council became the "City Council" and it acquired its own "[[Chief executive (Irish local government)|City Manager]]".&lt;ref name="galway-1985"/&gt; This was not presented as the acquiring of city status; [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for the Environment]] [[Liam Kavanagh]] said it was "the extension of the Galway City boundary and for upgrading of that city to the status of county borough".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0356/D.0356.198503140004.html Local Government (Reorganisation) Bill, 1985: Second Stage.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609124923/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0356/D.0356.198503140004.html |date= 9 June 2011 }} Dáil Éireann – Volume 356 – 14 March 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kilkenny===
The only city in the Republic which was not a county borough was [[Kilkenny]]. The original version of the 2001 Act would have reclassified as "towns" all "boroughs" which were not county boroughs, including Kilkenny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2000/2300/b2300.pdf Local Government Bill, 2000 ''As initiated''] Oireachtas&lt;/ref&gt; This drew objections from Kilkenny's borough councillors, and from [[Teachta Dála|TDs]] [[Phil Hogan]] and [[John J. McGuinness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0538/D.0538.200106130019.html Local Government Bill, 2000: Second Stage (Resumed).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606110451/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0538/D.0538.200106130019.html |date= 6 June 2011 }} Dáil Éireann – Volume 538 – 13 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, a clause was added to the bill:&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Act, 2001 §10(7)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This section is without prejudice to the continued use of the description city in relation to Kilkenny, to the extent that that description was used before the establishment day and is not otherwise inconsistent with this Act.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Act also states:&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Act, 2001 §11(16)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Subject to this Act, royal charters and letters patent relating to local authorities shall continue to apply for ceremonial and related purposes in accordance with local civic tradition but shall otherwise cease to have effect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Minister of State (Ireland)|Minister of State]] [[Tom Kitt]] explained these provisions as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0167/S.0167.200107110004.html Local Government Bill, 2000: Committee Stage.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606110535/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0167/S.0167.200107110004.html |date= 6 June 2011 }} Seanad Éireann – Volume 167 – 11 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;New provisions to recognise the term "city" to describe Kilkenny in line with long-established historical and municipal practice were brought in. Kilkenny was reconstituted as a borough corporation under the Municipal Corporations Act, 1840, as were Clonmel, Drogheda and Sligo. Section 2 of the 1840 Act specifically provided that Kilkenny is a borough which is still the current legal position in local government law. Traditionally, however, Kilkenny had been referred to as a city and this has its roots in local usage, deriving from a 17th century charter. It has not been a city in terms of local government law for at least 160 years.&lt;br /&gt;
As I have indicated, the Bill as published specifically provides that local charters can continue for ceremonial or related purposes, thereby safeguarding local tradition and practice. There was, therefore, no difficulty in Kilkenny continuing with this long-established tradition. However, Kilkenny Corporation indicated that it was concerned that the existing provisions in the Bill would not maintain the status quo in addition to concerns with the other boroughs that the term "town" was some form of diminution of status. In view of these concerns the Minister [ [[Noel Dempsey]] ] indicated that he would include a provision in the Bill to specifically recognise the traditional usage of the term "city" to describe Kilkenny. For the first time ever in the Local Government Act the unique position of Kilkenny is being recognised in local government law.&lt;br /&gt;
The Minister honoured in full his commitment on Kilkenny and delivered on what the deputation from Kilkenny sought. It was never intended that Kilkenny would be a city such as Dublin or Cork. All Kilkenny wanted was to be allowed to continue to use the term "city" in recognition of its ancient tradition. The deputation expressed its satisfaction to the Minister on his proposal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 2002, Phil Hogan (a [[Fine Gael]] TD) asked for "full city status" for Kilkenny;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0550/D.0550.200203200346.html Written Answers. – City Status.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609125142/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0550/D.0550.200203200346.html |date= 9 June 2011 }} Dáil Éireann – Volume 550 – 20 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 he said "Kilkenny has lost its City status courtesy of [[Fianna Fáil]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/Jobs-funding-under-threat-as.5480013.jp |title=Jobs, funding under threat as Bord Snip gets set to slash |last=Keane |first=Sean |date=24 July 2009 |work=Kilkenny People |accessdate=15 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729035702/http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/Jobs-funding-under-threat-as.5480013.jp |archivedate=29 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 established new municipal districts throughout the state and to abolish all the boroughs, including Kilkenny. Whereas the municipal district encompassing other boroughs are styled "the Borough District of Sligo [or Drogheda/Wexford/Clonmel]", that encompassing Kilkenny is styled "the Municipal District of Kilkenny City".&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Reform Act 2014, sec.19 [insertion into Local Government Act 2001 of Section 22A(2)(b) and 22A(2)(c)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Spatial Strategy===
{{main article|National Spatial Strategy}}
The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) for 2002–2020 planned to manage urban sprawl by identifying certain urban centres outside Dublin as areas for concentrated growth. The NSS report calls the regional centres "gateways" and the sub-regional centres "hubs".&lt;ref name="nss-38"&gt;NSS 2002, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; It does not call them "cities", but among the features it lists for "Gateways" are "City level range of theatres, arts and sports centres and public spaces/parks." and "City-scale water and waste management services."&lt;ref name="nss-40"&gt;NSS 2002, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; It also gives a target population for a gateway of over 100,000, including the suburban hinterland.&lt;ref name="nss-40"/&gt;

The report describes Cork, Limerick/[[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon]], Galway and Waterford, as  "existing gateways" and identifies four "new national level gateways": [[Dundalk]], [[Sligo]], and two "linked" gateways
[[Letterkenny]]/([[Derry]]), and [[Athlone]]/[[Tullamore]]/[[Mullingar]].&lt;ref name="nss-38"/&gt; The campaigns of Sligo and Dundalk for city status have referenced their status as regional gateways. The "[[Midlands Region, Ireland|Midlands]] Gateway", a [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] zone based on Tullamore, Athlone, and Mullingar, has occasionally been described as constituting a new or future city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/property/new-athlone-retail-complex-to-tap-into-midlands-new-wealth-255656.html|title=New Athlone retail complex to tap into Midlands' new wealth |date=22 June 2005|work=[[Irish Independent]]|quote=the government's National Spatial Strategy [creates] a major city by linking the towns of Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore.|accessdate=19 May 2010|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0415/spatialstrategy.html|title=Calls for re-opening of railway line|date=15 April 2005|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|quote=Delegates were also told that the gateway towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar would constitute a joint city with a population of over 100,000 people within the next 30 years.|publisher=RTÉ|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study by [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] concluded that the growth in population of the designated gateways was far less than had been planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/sligoweekender/2008/02/05/story34779.asp |title=Sligo won't ever be a city, says Dublin-based report |date=5 February 2005 |work=Sligo Weekender |accessdate=21 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622084401/http://archives.tcm.ie/sligoweekender/2008/02/05/story34779.asp |archivedate=22 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prospective cities===
{{See also|List of towns in the Republic of Ireland by population}}
Local councillors and [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s from several towns have raised the possibility of gaining city status. Prior to the 2001 Act, these suggestions were a matter of simple prestige.  Since the 2001 Act, the suggestions sometimes relate to the administrative functions of county-equivalent cities and sometimes to the ceremonial title. The [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for the Environment]], who is responsible for local government, has not entertained these suggestions,&lt;ref name="odowd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coc"/&gt; and has said "A modernised legal framework and structures at both regional and local level are now in place ... I have no proposals for amending legislation, which would be necessary to establish new city councils."&lt;ref name="noonan"/&gt;

====Sligo====
[[John Perry (Irish politician)|John Perry]] raised an [[adjournment debate]] in 1999 calling for [[Sligo]] to be declared a "millennium city", stating:&lt;ref name="sligo1999"&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0510/D.0510.199911090027.html Adjournment Debate. – City Status for Sligo.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609124412/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0510/D.0510.199911090027.html |date= 9 June 2011 }} Dáil Éireann – Volume 510 – 9 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;While the Government will probably say Sligo can call itself a city, an official declaration by the Government to declare Sligo the millennium city will confer an official status on it. The word 'city' has a certain meaning for investors. ... The requirement for a town to be called a city is that it be a seat of government or a cathedral town. Sligo is sometimes called a town and sometimes a city. This leads to confusion and the region falls between both stools. An official declaration of Sligo as a millennium city would have major significance for the entire area. The word city has a certain meaning for investors. It presumes a certain level of services and a status towards which the world reacts very favourably. The Fitzpatrick report established Sligo as a future growth centre. Even officials of Sligo Corporation are confused because in certain instances Sligo is called a town and in others a city.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Declan Bree]], mayor of the town in 2005, advocated "Sligo gaining city status similar to Limerick, Galway and Waterford."&lt;ref name="bree2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/sligoweekender/2005/06/28/story23635.asp |title=Sligo seeks to push out towards city status |last=Bree |first=Declan |date=28 June 2005 |work=Sligo Weekender |accessdate=15 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629122454/http://archives.tcm.ie/sligoweekender/2005/06/28/story23635.asp |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town council and county council held meetings to plan an expansion of the borough boundaries with a view to enhancing the prospects for such a change.&lt;ref name="bree2005"/&gt;

[[Michael Kennedy (Dublin politician)|Michael Kennedy]], [[Teachta Dála|TD]] for [[Dublin North (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North]], stated in 2007 that "[[Fingal County Council]] is planning to confer city status on our county town of [[Swords, County Dublin|Swords]] in the next 15 to 20 years as its population grows to 100,000."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0641/D.0641.200711140013.html Local Government (Roads Functions) Bill 2007: Second Stage (Resumed).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609125105/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0641/D.0641.200711140013.html |date= 9 June 2011 }} Dáil Éireann – Volume 641 – 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, the Council published "Your Swords, an Emerging City, Strategic Vision 2035", with a vision of Swords as "an emerging green city of 100,000 people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fingalcoco.ie/Planning/PlanningItemsOnDisplay/PlanningItemsPreviouslyonDisplay/L-ZPreviouslyonDisplay2004-2009/SwordsDraftVariation-June08/FileDownload,20172,en.pdf#page=1 |page=1 |title=Your Swords, an Emerging City, Strategic Vision 2035 |publisher=Fingal County Council |date=May 2008 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tallaght====
A campaign to have [[Tallaght]] given city status was launched in 2003 by Eamonn Maloney, a local member of [[South Dublin]] county council.&lt;ref name="times-tallaght"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article7061084.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000|title=Tallaght relaunches fight for city status|last=McInerney|first=Sarah|date=14 March 2010|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by the Tallaght Area Committee, comprising 10 of the 26 county councillors.&lt;ref name="times-tallaght"/&gt; Advantages envisaged by the campaign's website include having a dedicated [[Industrial Development Authority]] branch office for attracting investment, and facilitating the upgrade of [[Institute of Technology, Tallaght]] to university status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tallaghtcitycampaign.com/about-the-campaign.html |title=About The Campaign |publisher=Tallaght City Campaign |accessdate=21 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716191229/http://www.tallaghtcitycampaign.com/about-the-campaign.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Charlie O'Connor]] asked about city status for "Tallaght, [[Dublin 24]]" in 2007, the minister had "no plans to re-designate [[South Dublin]] County Council as a city council, or to establish Tallaght as a separate city authority".&lt;ref name="coc"&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2007/09/26/00673.asp Written Answers. – Local Government Reform.] Dáil Éireann – Volume 638 – 26 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor said later "The only problem I can see is our close proximity to Dublin".&lt;ref name="times-tallaght"/&gt; The head of the local [[chamber of commerce]] said in 2010, "If Tallaght was anywhere else in the country, it would have been a city years ago. We already have the population, [[Tallaght Hospital|the hospital]] and the third-level institution. If we're missing something, someone needs to tell us, clarify what the criteria [are], and we'll get it."&lt;ref name="times-tallaght"/&gt;

'''Divoká Šárka''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈɟɪvokaː ˈʃaːrka}}; Wild [[Šárka (name)|Šárka]]) is a [[nature reserve]] on the northwestern outskirts of [[Prague]], the capital city of the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prague.net/divoka-sarka The natural park Divoka Sarka]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 6th century the [[Slavs]] came to this area. In the 7th to 9th centuries was above the Džbán gorge a Slavic settlement, with an area of approximately 20 [[hectare|ha]] (3 ha fortified settlement).

A [[Canyon|gorge]] in the area is named after the female warrior [[The Maidens' War|Šárka]], who, according to [[Ancient Bohemian Legends]], threw herself to her death from its cliffs after betraying her lover [[The Maidens' War|Ctirad]] during the [[Maidens' War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A5140478 The Legend of Divoka Sarka]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the closest site to the city where the [[black woodpecker]] lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdlife.cz/index.php?ID=765 Czech Society for Ornithology: Birding in Prague]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lake [http://koupalistedzban.cz Džbán] (The Pitcher) on the border of the Divoká Šárka reserve area and a public swimming pool located in the middle of the reserver. The water of the pool is supplied by clean and fresh water from the Šárka spring creek that passes through the park and the lake.

'''''Eidolon''''' is a first-person [[open world]] [[Exploration game|exploration]] [[video game]] with narrative and [[Survival game|survival]] elements, developed and published by Ice Water Games. The game was released on August 1, 2014 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]].

The player character travels through the wilderness and ruined cities of post-apocalyptic [[Western Washington]], which is depicted using stylized, low-[[polygonal modeling|polygon]] graphics. While navigating this vast space, the player collects documents that reveal the stories of its previous inhabitants and the passing away of civilization; a key theme of the game is the potential for nature to outlast human activity. Although the player must obtain food and manage the risks of cold and injuries, these aspects of the gameplay were designed to be less challenging than in most survival games, to support a more relaxed mood and slower pace of exploration.

''Eidolon'' obtained a mixed reception. While reviewers mostly appreciated its distinctive graphical style (which drew comparisons with ''[[Proteus (video game)|Proteus]]'') and its narrative, some criticised the gameplay as too slow-paced or repetitive.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Eidolon_(video_game)_screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A screenshot of first-person gameplay from Eidolon.|The player character holds a fishing rod next to a lake and campfire, with stylized trees and hills visible in the background. The floating green shape to the right marks a collectible document, while the icons in the lower left are [[status effect]] indicators.]]

''Eidolon'' simulates the exploration of an [[open world]] from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective. The extensive world map encompasses multiple biomes including forests, mountains and the remains of ruined cities, and walking across it requires hours of real time.&lt;ref name="sears"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kelton Sears|title= Eidolon Asks Us to Imagine a World Without Us|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/954354-129/the-new-video-game-eidolon-asks|website=[[Seattle Weekly]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphics, which have been described as [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimalist]],&lt;ref name="sears"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haulica"&gt;{{cite web|author=Radu Haulica|title=Eidolon Review|url=http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/games/pc/Eidolon-Review-456791.shtml|website=[[Softpedia]]|date=August 28, 2014|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; feature stylized, polygonal objects, an absence of [[texture mapping|textures]] and a large [[draw distance]].&lt;ref name="sears"/&gt; The game world's appearance is affected by varying weather and a day-night cycle.&lt;ref name="dequidt"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack de Quidt|title=Eidolon Diary: Diarising Eidolon|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/10/21/eidolon-diary/|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features a minimal [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]&lt;ref name="plunkett"&gt;{{cite web|author=Luke Plunkett|title=Survival Games Are Moving Beyond "Zombies &amp; Crafting"|url=http://kotaku.com/survival-games-are-moving-beyond-zombies-crafting-1616695312|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with small icons to indicate [[status effect]]s such as hunger and illness,&lt;ref name="priestman"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Priestman|title=Rumors from the forlorn: An Eidolon Review|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/eidolon/|website=[[Kill Screen]]|date=August 15, 2014|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most interaction is managed as part of the backpack interface.&lt;ref name="plunkett"/&gt;

Navigation is a principal challenge for the player.

==Plot==

''Eidolon'' takes place in approximately the year 2400, according to the game's website.&lt;ref name="eidolon_website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eidolon|url=http://www.icewatergames.com/eidolon/|publisher=Ice Water Games|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting is a compressed and simplified representation of [[Western Washington]], including the [[Puget Sound region]] and the [[Olympic Peninsula]]; the [[Kitsap Peninsula]] was added by a patch after release.&lt;ref name="maxon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Maxon|title=Eidolon Post-mortem|url=http://www.icewatergames.com/blog/2016/3/2/et85dl2txp5tk18vnn7eshf7hv80j7|publisher=Ice Water Games|date=March 2, 2016|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria, British Columbia]] is also accessible via a road bridge from [[Port Angeles, Washington|Port Angeles]]. The player begins in a forest between [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] and [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]].&lt;ref name="sears"/&gt; Gradual exploration reveals that the region is deserted and has largely reverted to wilderness, with its former cities reduced to overgrown ruins. Much of [[Seattle]] is underwater, while the other major cities are ringed by massive walls and littered with human skeletons.

The background to this desolation is revealed through documents and images that the player may collect in any order. It becomes clear that events were set in motion by the development of technology that increased human longevity. When an earthquake in 2031 flooded Seattle, it exposed deposits of a new mineral that was used to construct towering "Beacons" in cities around the world. Humans were nearly immortal while within range of a Beacon, but their biological dependence on the technology left them at risk of fatal withdrawal symptoms outside the cities. Responding to the massive movements of population and tension between supporters and opponents of the Beacons, many cities constructed walls, isolating themselves from each other and the rural population that continued to experience natural lifespans. This period also saw the rise to prominence of the Sennin, people with heritable mutations that granted innate immortality and superhuman abilities.

Growing conflicts and social breakdown culminated in "the Fall", a period around 2110 in which the destruction of Beacons by extremists left city-dwellers to die or flee to surviving cities, themselves diminishing in number and hostile towards refugees. Bellevue and Olympia fell at this time, while Victoria survived as a secluded police state for several decades longer. By the period in which the game is set, the rural communities in Western Washington that survived the Fall have disintegrated. In one series of letters, a Sennin named Triya reveals that she came to Washington long after the Fall in search of a cure for Beacon dependence for the world's few remaining cities; she eventually found this in Victoria, but its effectiveness is unknown.

==Development and release==

''Eidolon'''s primary creator, Kevin Maxon, began work on the game as a thesis project while studying game design at [[Western Washington University]], and it was then developed over 20 months by Maxon's company Ice Water Games.&lt;ref name="sears"/&gt; Thematically, Maxon intended to contrast the transience of human civilization with the permanence of nature.&lt;ref name="sears"/&gt;&lt;ref name="saeedy"/&gt; This theme is reflected in the game's use of [[Walt Whitman]]'s poem "Eidolons", which provided not only the title but quotations that appear when the protagonist sleeps.&lt;ref name="sears"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dequidt"/&gt; Maxon describes the game as "post-human" rather than "post-apocalyptic" because of the absence of human NPCs.&lt;ref name="saeedy"/&gt;

The game's design, influenced by academic debate on the relative priority of systems and stories in video games,&lt;ref name="sears"/&gt; was intended to separate its rule-based gameplay mechanics from the authored narrative of the backstory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ice Water Games|title=Why Eidolon Needs to Exist|website=Ice Water Games|type=blog|url=http://icewatergames.tumblr.com/post/60776525747/why-eidolon-needs-to-exist|date=September 9, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player character was left unspecified to avoid potential conflict between the character's goals and the player's. To allow the player to develop "mid-sized" goals between their overall exploration of the world and small-scale movement, the developers added the binoculars and the system of direction indicators linked to tags.&lt;ref name="maxon"/&gt; The survival elements were designed to be minimal in order to allow relaxed exploration.&lt;ref name="saeedy"/&gt;

The graphics were first planned as two-dimensional but changed to three-dimensional to provide the experience of viewing a distant horizon.&lt;ref name="maxon"/&gt; The lack of polygons and textures for in-game objects was originally intended to allow computers to render the game's expansive landscapes, but Maxon decided that this minimalist style was actually more attractive.&lt;ref name="sears"/&gt; Although there is no seasonal cycle in the game, shifts in the color palette over the course of each day were intended to suggest the passage of seasons from spring to winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ice Water Games|title=It's pretty big! When we first roughed it out...|website=Ice Water Games|type=blog|url=http://icewatergames.tumblr.com/post/74740652899/how-big-will-the-world-be-thought-it-was-going-to|date=January 27, 2014|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A pre-release trailer in December 2013 drew attention from gaming media including comparisons of the visual style to that of ''[[Proteus (video game)|Proteus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathan Grayson|title=Survivor: Proteus Edition – Eidolon Gets First Trailer|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/12/17/survivor-proteus-edition-eidolon-gets-first-trailer/|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=December 17, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Johnson|title=The outdoorsy Eidolon is more stunning than actual nature|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/outdoorsy-eidolon-more-stunning-actual-nature/|website=[[Kill Screen]]|date=December 17, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early attention encouraged a [[Steam Greenlight]] campaign, after which ''Eidolon'' was released through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on August 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eidolon on Steam|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/286140/|website=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is available for Windows and Mac, but the Ice Water Games website warns of compatibility problems under OSX with some recent [[video card]]s.&lt;ref name="eidolon_website"/&gt;

==Reception==

As of December 2016, [[Metacritic]] displays an aggregate review score for ''Eidolon'' of 64, representing "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eidolon|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/eidolon|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game developer Jack de Quidt wrote a positive review for [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]], expressing his enjoyment of both the impressionistic graphics and the experience of navigation, "treating an open world as a great spatial puzzle". He especially praised the gradual pace of the game's revelations, concerning both the narrative and the details of the gameplay, and considered that spoilers could "rob this wonderful, strange game of its power".&lt;ref name="dequidt"/&gt;

Writing for [[Kill Screen]], Chris Priestman gave ''Eidolon'' a score of 62. Priestman praised the appearance of the game's "routinely poetic expanse" and noted his desire to "compulsively snap screenshots", while also noting that he encountered graphical glitches. He viewed the narrative as interesting from a philosophical and science-fictional viewpoint, finding an implied connection between the theme of immortality and the player character's own ability to survive seemingly lethal events. However, the review took a less favorable view of the mechanics of discovering documents, arguing that this was over-repetitive and detracted from the intrinsic pleasure of exploration in an [[overjustification effect]].&lt;ref name="priestman"/&gt;

Radu Haulica's [[Softpedia]] review gave ''Eidolon'' three stars out of five ("poor"). In contrast to de Quidt, Haulica complained that discovering the narrative required excessive, tedious wandering, and also that the limited survival aspects provided insufficient additional reason for engagement. Haulica considered that although views of distant scenery could be effective, the minimal visual style and the "very limited and drab color palette" were generally unappealing.&lt;ref name="haulica"/&gt;

[[File:FEMA - 44996 - FEMA Administrator W. Craig Fugate speaking on using social media.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) Administrator W. Craig Fugate speaking at a Red Cross seminar on using social media during natural disasters. GIS has an integral role to play in such agendas.]]

[[Geographic information system]] (GIS) is a commonly used tool for environmental management, modelling and planning. As simply defined by [[Michael Goodchild]], GIS is as ‘a computer system for handling geographic information in a digital form’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodchild|first=Michael F.|title=GIScience and Systems|journal=International Encyclopedia of Human Geography|date=July 2009|pages=526–538|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080449104000298|doi=10.1016/B978-008044910-4.00029-8|isbn=9780080449104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years it has played an integral role in participatory, collaborative and [[open data]] philosophies. Social and technological evolutions have elevated ‘digital’ and ‘environmental’ agendas to the forefront of public policy, the global media and the private sector.   

Government departments routinely use digital spatial platforms to plan and model proposed changes to road networks, building design, [[Green belt|greenbelt land]], utility provision, crime prevention, [[energy production]], [[waste management]] and [[security]]. [[Non-profit organizations]] also incorporate geospatial and web-mapping approaches into political campaigns to lobby governments, to protest against socially or environmentally harmful companies, and to generate public support. Private business, whether in [[land management]], [[resource extraction]], retail, manufacturing or [[social media]] for example, also incorporate GIS into overall profit-making strategies.

== Citizen science and GIS ==
[[Citizen science]] is part of the wider emphasis upon public involvement in expert fields across Western democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chilvers|first=Jason|title=Environmental risk, uncertainty, and participation: mapping an emergent epistemic community|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=2008|volume=40|issue=12|pages=2990–3008|doi=10.1068/a39279}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is 'often used to describe communities or networks of citizens who act as observers in some domain of science’.&lt;ref name=Goodchild&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodchild|first=Michael F.|title=Citizens as sensors: the world of volunteered geography|journal=GeoJournal|volume=69|issue=4|pages=211–221|doi=10.1007/s10708-007-9111-y|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although more narrowly used to describe the shift to specifically [[User-generated content|user-generated]] forms of knowledge creation, it has been routinely invoked in both the [[Public Participation GIS|public participatory GIS]] and environmental governance literature at large. 
[[File:US Navy 100629-N-5549O-017 rd Adm. Thad Allen, national incident commander for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response, briefs Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) the Honorable Ray Mabus.jpg|thumb|left|The Secretary of the US Navy, [[Ray Mabus]] is briefed on the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] response. A web-based GIS is visible in the background. The [[NOAA]]-developed Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA) was designed to assist resource managers post-spill.]]

=== National Audubon Society: Gulf Spill Bird Tracker ===
Much of the citizen science literature is grounded in wildlife study. For example, Goodchild&lt;ref name=Goodchild/&gt; references the [[Audubon Society|National Audubon Society’s]] [[Christmas Bird Count]] (CBC) as a classic case of citizen science in action. Each year over the winter period, the American conservation organization encourages volunteer bird-watchers to gather information on the number of bird species in their local area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Audubon|title=Audubon Science: Christmas Bird Count|url=http://birds.audubon.org/sites/default/files/documents/ChristmasBirdCount.pdf|publisher=National Audubon Society|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once field data has been collected, each volunteer is able to submit their bird sightings into an online database, for the benefit of both scientific researchers and bird enthusiasts. The [[eBird]] project – enabling the general public to explore a range of map- and chart-based bird species datasets – is a result of these yearly mass volunteer events.

Of particular interest is the [http://ebird.org/tools/oilspill/ Gulf Spill Bird Tracker]; an interactive sightings map for ten species deemed at risk from the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in 2010. Gulf Coast bird watchers were encouraged (at the time when it was live) to submit their sightings of a range of at-danger birds (such as the [[brown pelican]], [[roseate spoonbill]] and the [[Wilson's plover]]), to help aid the clean-up operation, and pin-point beaches most affected by the oil spill. The National Audubon Society has been deeply involved in the Gulf Oil Response since the disaster, and has a dedicated program to co-ordinate resources, liaise with local government, and deploy equipment post-spill. Their 6-month report brought together some of these key factors. Not only was the National Audubon Society’s citizen science initiative highlighted as the ‘backbone…for understanding the [immediate] impact of the disaster’,&lt;ref name=Audubon&gt;{{cite web|author=Audubon|title=Oil and Birds: Too Close for Comfort|url=http://gulfoilspill.audubon.org/sites/default/files/documents/oilandbirds-toocloseforcomfort_october2010_1.pdf|publisher=National Audubon Society|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also for long-term efforts to monitor the health of imperilled species in the [[Gulf Coast]] region. Moreover, their grassroots ethos has mobilized a vast number of Gulf volunteers to ‘urge elected officials and government agencies to hold polluters like [[BP]] accountable’,&lt;ref name=Audubon/&gt; for the financial, environmental, economic and social costs associated with such disasters. This is perhaps the most obvious example of web-based mapping software (a more ‘citizen-friendly’ form of GIS) and [[environmental governance]] discourses colliding head on. The notion of volunteered, user-generated, citizen data is the guiding mantra for such projects, and the cornerstone of any wider attempts to lobby national governments, engage with local community groups, and generate scientific research.

=== Mapping for Change ===
Another example of citizen science and GIS in action is taken from inside the academy. [[University College London]] (UCL) and London 21 sustainability network's [http://www.mappingforchange.org.uk/ Mapping for Change] initiative has encouraged voluntary groups, local authorities and development agencies to build map-based projects to support political, social and environmental aims. They even provide a [http://www.mappingforchange.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/noise_toolkit.pdf noise mapping toolkit] on the Mapping for Change website itself, designed to help local communities gather evidence of intrusive and unwanted environmental nuisances and hazards. The [[Royal Docks]] community in London has used such a toolkit to help present their concerns to the [[Greater London Authority]] Environment Committee over plans to expand [[London City Airport]]. Armed with sound meters, survey sheets and access to an online mapping platform, residents were able to monitor noise levels; from overhead planes and passing motor vehicles, to birdsong and ambient river sounds.[[File:SAS plane landing at London City Airport.jpg|thumb|right|A plane lands at [[London City Airport]]. Communities in the area have used web-based noise maps to demonstrate their objections to proposed flight expansion.]] Their data was then visualized in various formats to help advance their argument. Royal Docks’ residents are continually plagued by planes taking-off and landing at London City Airport, and plans to expand the number of flights a year by 50% (up to 120,000) were opposed by local communities on the basis that it would decrease their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levitt|first=Tom|title=High Court battle over London City Airport expansion|url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/685622/high_court_battle_over_london_city_airport_expansion.html|publisher=The Ecologist|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

GIS and citizen science go hand-in-hand. Web-based mapping platforms serve as useful tools for national conservation societies, local community groups and planning departments to compile tangible data on environmental issues. Voluntary, grassroots approaches can help compile lay knowledges that feed back into more formal political frameworks.

== Environmental justice ==
At a local level, GIS has been frequently used to engage [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in the planning of environmentally ‘bad’ sites. [[Nuclear power stations]], [[wind farms]], [[landfill site]]s, and other energy facilities are often subject to [[NIMBY]] opposition for aesthetic, health and social reasons. This is despite of their capacity to produce 'good' economic factors or employment opportunities. GIS has thus found itself deployed alongside broader [[cost-benefit analysis]] (CBA), and [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA) approaches to socio-political conflict. [[Environmental Justice]] (EJ) activists believe these decisions act to further embed racial and class divides.&lt;ref name=Schlosberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlosberg|first=David|title=Reconceiving Environmental Justice: Global Movements And Political Theories|journal=Environmental Politics|year=2004|volume=13|issue=3|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/0964401042000229025}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIS provides an important angle to the EJ movement.

=== Elements of justice ===
Broadly, the EJ movement is a loose connection of social groups, stakeholders and activists who have sought to contest socio-political injustices. Commonly, this has been through a single motive; the equal distribution of environmental goods and bads. As Schlosberg contends, ‘the issue of distribution is always present and always key’ to the guiding EJ ethos. Yet, other demands are frequently put forward. Following Schlosberg, there are two further demands that constitute the EJ movement than a mere ‘[re-]distribution of environmental ills and benefits.&lt;ref name=Schlosberg/&gt; The first is the ‘recognition of the diversity of participants and experiences in affected communities’.&lt;ref name=Schlosberg/&gt; Thus, EJ demands that people affected by environmental injustices are appropriately noticed by others. A lack of recognition in local community discourses, ‘demonstrated by various forms of insults, degradation, and devaluation…’,&lt;ref name=Schlosberg/&gt; marginalize those already least able to contest political decisions. The second is the notion of ''participatory justice''. According to Schlosberg;&lt;ref name=Schlosberg/&gt; ‘[i]f you are not recognised, you do not participate.’ Thus, recognitional justice leads directly to participatory justice. In EJ terms, participation is about involving those outside the typical political/institutional order. Democratic and participatory decision-making procedures are both an element of, and a condition for, social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Iris Marion|title=Justice and the politics of difference|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0-691-07832-7|edition=11th print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, institutionalised exclusion, social cultures of misrecognition, and current distributional patterns can be challenged.&lt;ref name=Schlosberg/&gt;

[[File:FEMA - 14947 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 08-30-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial photograph of [[New Orleans]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. The High magnitude flood event disproportionately affected the city's poor, black neighbourhoods.]]

=== Flood hazards, race, &amp; environmental justice in New York ===
Maantay and Maroko's&lt;ref name=Maantay&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maantay|first=J|author2=Maroko, A|title=Mapping urban risk: Flood hazards, race, &amp; environmental justice in New York|journal=Applied Geography|year=2009|volume=29|issue=1|pages=111–124|doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2008.08.002|pmid=20047020|pmc=2680302}}&lt;/ref&gt; research is intended to help hazard management and [[disaster planning]] before and after a high magnitude flood event. By using a Cadastral-based Expert Dasymetric System (CEDS) they were able to estimate the number of ‘vulnerable sub-populations’ in the densely populated New York City area. Their research broadly supports an EJ approach to natural disaster mitigation. By highlighting the importance of equality issues and the disproportionate exposure some people have to such events, they invoke the EJ movement’s notion of distributional justice. The lack of ‘strong social, financial, or political support structures’ are constituent factors in how people deal with large-scale disasters.&lt;ref name=Maantay/&gt; [[Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina|The criticism of the US government’s response]] to the devastating effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, draw on such notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cutter|first=Susan|authorlink= Susan Cutter |title=The Geography of Social Vulnerability: Race, Class, and Catastrophe|url=http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Cutter/|work=Understanding Katrina: Perspectives from the Social Sciences|publisher=Social Science Research Council (SSRC)|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online publication set-up by the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC) entitled [http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/ Understanding Katrina] helps to ground this research in socio-political approaches to so-called ‘natural’ disasters.

Maantay and Maroko believe that GIS can have an important role in these 'risk-framed' understandings. As New York is a ‘hyper-heterogeneous urban area’,&lt;ref name=Maantay/&gt; traditional administrative population data is insufficient for flood zone/population risk research. A more fine-tuned analysis is possible if tax-level datasets (based on smaller, residential units) are used instead. Maantay and Maroko use [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) floodplain and tax-level datasets to determine the potential number of people at risk. A CEDS approach significantly increases the number of affected people within New York City. In using a different GIS method, Maantay and Maroko are able to better represent the impact of such flood events on minority populations. As such, their research supports all of Schlosberg's notions of distributional, recognitional and participatory justice.&lt;ref name=Schlosberg/&gt; As noted by themselves; ‘the disadvantages suffered by racial and ethnic minority communities during and after disasters are due primarily to their low economic status and lack of political power’.&lt;ref name=Maantay/&gt; Their research broadly supports the aims of the EJ movement.

== New urban landscapes ==
GIS has also had a role in formulating new urban landscapes. Planned cities - designed entirely from scratch - routinely use digital technologies to visualize and demonstrate urban layouts, building structures and transport arrangements. Although [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] technologies are often used to assist in the visualization, construction, and delivery of certain engineering features, GIS helps to realize distinctly spatial components of the city. Environmental narratives of a 'carbon-free' and sustainable future favour those in the GIS industry. 'The challenge of the 21st century' as [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] would have it, 'is to arrest the progress of climate change'.&lt;ref name=ESRI&gt;{{cite web|title=Masdar City: The world’s first carbon-neutral city |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908001632/http://www.esri.com/industries/facilities-management/pdfs/masdar.pdf|author=ESRI|publisher=Environmental Systems Research Institute|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geospatial software has played its part in developing this narrative.

=== Masdar City ===
[[Masdar City]] is a ‘[[sustainable]], [[zero-carbon]], [[Zero waste|zero-waste]]’ project currently under construction in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). Situated in the [[Abu Dhabi]] emirate, Masdar is described as 'an emerging global hub for renewable energy and clean technologies'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Masdar City? |url=http://www.masdarcity.ae/en/27/what-is-masdar-city-/ |publisher=Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531151048/http://www.masdarcity.ae/en/27/what-is-masdar-city-/ |archivedate=31 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company]] have funded and overseen the $18bn dollar project. No cars are allowed on its streets, energy is produced in part by renewable sources, building materials are ‘sustainable’ and water-use is controlled. GIS is being employed to plan, facilitate and test a plethora of environmental phenomena and technological processes.

A dedicated GIS team is responsible for ‘managing the overall spatial information needs’ of the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McElvaney |first=Shannon |title=Masdar City Development Programme: Using GIS Technologies to Help Plan and Build a Sustainable City |url=http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc09/uc/papers/pap_1854.pdf |accessdate=16 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312133948/http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc09/uc/papers/pap_1854.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with the drawing of a common base map with which to support the city’s infrastructure. Without a spatial plan of Masdar’s operative mechanisms, the city will fail to deliver its grand ambition. In particular, GIS is being used to visualize, analyse and model ''land-use'' in the city. Masdar – unlike any other city – has to incorporate a wealth of energy-related facilities within its perimeter. As EJ activists are all too aware, the siting of such facilities can be a key area of conflict. Masdar’s [[water treatment]] and [[sewage treatment|sewage plants]], material recycling centre, [[solar power plant]], [[geothermal]] test site, [[solar panel]] test field and [[concrete batching plant]] all need to be situated inside the city’s boundaries. As [[CH2M HILL]]’s Site Control and GIS Manager for the Masdar project confirms; ‘never have so many environmental facilities come together in one place’.&lt;ref name=ESRI/&gt; GIS is the central tool with which to imagine – in a digital environment – different siting scenarios. In this case, GIS is seen to operate as a [[decision-making tool]]; informing the practitioners who work on the Masdar project.

GIS is also being used to model some of Masdar’s key infrastructural features directly. Its involvement in simulating the citywide [[Personal rapid transit|Personal Rapid Transport System]] (PRTS) is one such example. As common road vehicles are banned from the city, the ‘driverless’ transit system will transport people and freight across the 7km2 area. GIS is capable of modelling the system route, due to comprise 85 passenger stations and approximately 1,700 automated vehicles. By drawing spatial buffer zones around potential PRTS stops, passenger-distance maps can visualize residential areas that fall outside of ideal service requirements. GIS is an instrumental tool in visualizing such problems. A smooth, functioning PRTS is a central infrastructural aspect of Masdar’s grand vision, and engineering companies who specialize in GIS technologies have helped in realizing this digitally-orchestrated dream. Yet journalists in particular have been sceptical. As Bryan Walsh has argued; [wi]ll Masdar City ever really develop the authenticity of a real city?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Bryan|title=Masdar City: The World's Greenest City?|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2043934,00.html|publisher=TIME|accessdate=16 May 2011|date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or as [[Jonathan Glancey]] contends, will its 'ultra-modern aspects...prove to be a mirage'?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glancey|first=Jonathan|title=Inside Masdar City: a modern mirage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/10/inside-masdar-city-modern-mirage|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2011|location=London|date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-political agendas ==
[[File:Copenhagen - COP15.png|thumb|[[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|The 2009 Copenhagen Summit]] failed to produce a legally binding treaty on national CO2 levels, despite (or perhaps because of) a near-global delegation. An example of [[Jacques Ranciere|Jacques Ranciere's]] ''partition of the sensible'' in action. [[IPCC]] data, based on GIS and environmental modelling processes, provide the basis for these proposed legal frameworks.]]

‘Post-politics’ is a [[neologism]] for the consensual, participatory and techno-managerial approach to modern governance. Originally coined by [[Slavoj Zizek]], and discussed by the likes of [[Jacques Rancière]] and [[Erik Swyngedouw]], the post-political critique argues that life in the Western world is routinely characterized by the de-politicizing effects of a 'consensual police order'.&lt;ref name=Swyngedouw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical City: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Production|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–620|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of different techno-managerial ‘fixes’ have been sought by [[neoliberal]] governments in order to solve expressly environmental problems, rather than due political processes. As Swyngedouw has argued, such forces have ‘replaced debate, disagreement and dissensus with a series of technologies of governing that fuse around consensus, agreement, accountancy merits and technocratic environmental management’.&lt;ref name=Swyngedouw/&gt; Thus if the rise of the post-political order is due to the increasing reliance upon ‘technocratic environmental management’, as Swyngedouw has argued, then GIS – as a tool for neoliberal environmental governance – is implicit in such an order.

=== The police, the political and politics ===
Firstly, it serves to elucidate upon claims to a ‘post-political impasse’. This is best understood through what Ranciere calls ''the police'', ''the political'' and ''politics''.&lt;ref name=Ranciere&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Ten theses on politics|journal=Theory and Event|year=2001|volume=5|issue=3|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v005/5.3ranciere.html|doi=10.1353/tae.2001.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is within these three terms that Ranciere carves out what he calls the true meaning of political action, and of what it is to exercise political right. As Panagia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Panagia|first=Davide|title=Ceci n’est pas un argument: An Introduction to the Ten Theses|journal=Theory and Event|year=2001|volume=5|issue=3|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v005/5.3panagia.html|accessdate=16 May 2011|doi=10.1353/tae.2001.0027}}&lt;/ref&gt; neatly summarizes; ‘politics is the practice of asserting one’s position that ruptures the logic of [[arche]]’. Politics is about rediscovering the art of debate, conflict and struggle, and not merely about re-organizing the administrative framework of existing political structures (namely, the state apparatus).'' The political'' – in Ranciere’s words – is for ‘[t]he one who is ‘unaccounted-for’, the one who has no speech to be heard’. Democracy does not work towards an ‘idealized-normative condition’&lt;ref name=Swyngedouw/&gt; of equal rights, but is built upon the very [[ontological]] notion of such. ''Politics'' brings the political into the foreground; rendering that which was previously noise, legitimate speech. Much of what is thought to be politics in the contemporary world is actually subsumed within ''the police''. Policy is not politics is this sense, then. This is what Ranciere calls ''the partition of the sensible'',&lt;ref name=Ranciere/&gt; or the established order of things.

The post-politics of contemporary governance brings all that it can into this order. Those who were previously cast outside the police structure are now '‘responsible’ partners’&lt;ref name=Swyngedouw/&gt; in a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]-based arrangement. All views that were previously antagonistic and conflictual are now brought together in a more homely, consensual arena. No room is made for ‘irrational’ demands. As such, Ranciere says that, ‘[c]onsensus is the reduction of politics to the police’.&lt;ref name=Ranciere/&gt; Nowhere has this been more visible than within the apocalyptic climate narratives told ''ad infinitum'' by environmental practitioners, policy-makers and non-governmental organizations. Consensual politics has found its home in the environmental arena.

=== Post-political GIS ===
In short, GIS works as a tool for mediating and diffusing socio-environmental conflicts. It does so by working within Ranciere’s notion of the partition of the sensible. Whilst it may allow previously unheard voices to gain a voice (in environmental justice campaigns, foremostly), it still does not – as a tool of neoliberal governance – make room for those who are deemed ‘outside’, unruly or conflictual to have a voice. For example, Elwood laments the notionally ‘participatory’ flag-waving carried out by those involved in urban GIS-based projects.&lt;ref name=Elwood&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwood|first=Sarah|title=Negotiating Knowledge Production: The Everyday Inclusions, Exclusions, and Contradictions of Participatory GIS Research|journal=The Professional Geographer|year=2006|volume=58|issue=2|pages=197–208|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9272.2006.00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she says, ‘the skills and financial and temporal costs of using GIS effectively bar many individuals, social groups and organizations from participation in research and decision-making where it is used’, denying those without the means to participate, from participation.&lt;ref name=Elwood/&gt; GIS does not necessarily facilitate involvement for all.

Moreover, GIS is limited in its ontological scope, reducing all things spatial to a ''calculable order''. As Leszczynski contends,&lt;ref name=Leszczynski&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leszczynski|first=Agnieszka|title=Quantitative Limits to Qualitative Engagements: GIS, Its Critics, and the Philosophical Divide|journal=The Professional Geographer|year=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=350–365|doi=10.1080/00330120902932026}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIS operates a ‘discourse populated by discrete objects of knowledge’; differentiating ‘between the binary of truth and error’.&lt;ref name=Crampton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=J. W.|title=Cartographic calculations of territory|journal=Progress in Human Geography|year=2011|volume=35|issue=1|pages=92–103|doi=10.1177/0309132509358474}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIS is thus a central ''polic-ing'' tool for contemporary socio-environmental governance. It works to order space into discrete and ordered formats. As Jeremy Crampton points out,&lt;ref name=Crampton/&gt; ‘the basic model of the world in GIScience texts is: points, lines, areas, surfaces and volumes’, ill-prepared to deal with non-discrete, continuous environmental phenomena. All that does not fit into this order is left aside. GIS thus excludes that which cannot be ‘structured accordingly’,&lt;ref name=Leszczynski/&gt; excluding [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] that do not neatly fit into the formal computing framework; a formal framework synonymous with ‘the accountancy calculus of risk and the technologies of expert administration’.&lt;ref name=Swyngedouw/&gt; The apparatus of choice for the techno-enviro-managerialist, if Ranciere and Swyngedouw's analyses are to be put forward, and Elwood, Crampton and Leszczynski's criticism's are to be accepted, is GIS.

The '''Geographic Names Information System''' ('''GNIS''') is a database that contains name and locative information about more than two million physical and cultural features located throughout the [[United States|United States of America]] and its territories. It is a type of [[gazetteer]].  GNIS was developed by the [[United States Geological Survey]] in cooperation with the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] (BGN) to promote the standardization of feature names.

The database is part of a system that includes topographic map names and bibliographic references. The names of books and historic maps that confirm the feature or place name are cited. Variant names, alternatives to official federal names for a feature, are also recorded. Each feature receives a permanent, unique feature record identifier, sometimes called the GNIS identifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=US Census County Based TIGER/Line® 2009 Data Dictionary: Entity, Joins, Attributes, and Domains |url=http://www.scribekey.com/EntityAttributes/AREALM.singles.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qea5SVUR?url=http://www.scribekey.com/EntityAttributes/AREALM.singles.html |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The database never removes an entry, "except in cases of obvious duplication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first=| last=Cartographic Users Advisory Council (CUAC) | title=2007 Agency Presentation Minutes | publisher=US Geological Survey | date=April 26–27, 2007 | location=Reston, VA | url=http://cuac.wustl.edu/annualmtg2007.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111180726/http://cuac.wustl.edu/annualmtg2007.htm|archivedate=11 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12069">The '''geology of [[Nigeria]]''' formed beginning in the [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]] eons of the [[Precambrian]]. The country forms the Nigerian Province and more than half of its surface is igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock from the Precambrian. Between 2.9 billion and 500 million years ago, Nigeria was affected by three major [[orogeny]] mountain-building events and related igneous intrusions. Following the [[Pan-African orogeny]], in the [[Cambrian]] at the time that multi-cellular life proliferated, Nigeria began to experience regional sedimentation and witnessed new igneous intrusions. By the [[Cretaceous]] period of the late [[Mesozoic]], massive sedimentation was underway in different basins, due to a large [[marine transgression]]. By the [[Eocene]], in the [[Cenozoic]], the region returned to terrestrial conditions. 

Nigeria has tremendous oil and natural gas resources housed in its thick sedimentary basins, as well as reserves of gold, lead, zinc, [[tantalite]], [[columbite]], coal and tin. 

==Stratigraphy, Tectonics &amp; Geologic History==
The oldest [[Precambrian]] rocks in Nigeria likely formed during the [[Archean]] or the [[Paleoproterozoic]], forming the Beninian [[gneiss]], in the Benin-Nigeria Orogen, formed during the [[Proterozoic]] [[Pan-African orogeny]]. The crystalline basement rock of the country is grouped as the Nigerian Province, a southern continuation of the central Hoggar reactivated basement. 

The ancient rocks of the Nigerian Province are split up by thrust and shear zones. The Migmatite-Gneiss Complex covers half of Nigeria's surface area and encompasses Archean gray gneisses, with [[tonalite]] and [[granodiorite]] consistencies. Within this complex are occurrences of [[schist]], [[migmatite]], [[garnet]], [[sillimanite]], [[kyanite]] and [[staurolite]], which together indicate high-grade metamorphism up to the level of [[amphibolite]] on the sequence of [[metamorphic facies]]. Granites are associated with [[charnockite]] bodies and [[granulite]] facies metamorphism. 

The Migmatite-Gneiss Complex differs in the Ibadan area, in the southwest. Banded gneiss, schist and [[quartzite]] formed from the metamorphism of [[greywacke]], [[shale]] and interbedded sandstones. Some [[amphibolite]] layers record the metamorphosed remains of a [[tholeiitic magma series]]. The early folding and metamorphism in the Ibadan area was followed by the emplacement of [[aplite]] schist and microgranodiorite dikes during the [[Liberian orogeny]] 2.75 billion years ago. More intense deformation followed 2.2 billion years ago during the [[Eburnean orogeny]]. 

Metazquartzites in the Ibadan area, likely from the [[Proterozoic]], are overlain by [[pelite]] schist, intruded by [[mafic]] sills rich in magnesium. They are overlain by [[Neoproterozoic]] pelites, including [[phyllite]] and both [[muscovite]] and [[biotite]] schists, as well as quartzites that form strike ridges in several parts of Nigeria. 

Younger metasediments are found in the southwest and northwest in synclinorial schist belts. Compared to the surrounding migmatite-gneiss complexes, these low-grade metamorphic rocks have [[isoclinal]] folding and steeply dipping foliation. They have faulted and sheared boundaries with the surrounding rock. 

Geologists have interpreted these schist belts the remains of paleo-rift systems. The [[Pan-African orogeny]] in the late Proterozoic affected all of the Archean and Paleoproterozoic rocks in the region. Continent-continent collision and eastward subduction affected the southern Trans-Saharan mobile belt and emplaced [[granitoids]] throughout the Nigerian Province. In Nigeria, Pan-African orogeny related granite, [[syenite]] and [[diorite]] intrusions formed between 700 and 500 million years ago and are known as the Older Granites. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=196-197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
In the [[Cambrian]], at the beginning of the [[Paleozoic]], volcanic debris filled [[molasse]] [[grabens]], forming [[dacite]] and [[shoshonite]], as the Older Granites continued to emplace. In some cases, granite intrusions formed large [[batholiths]] and [[charnockite]]. The end of the Pan-African orogeny was also accompanied by the intrusion of [[basalt]] and [[dolerite]] dikes. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=196}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
In the [[Mesozoic]], during the [[Jurassic]], ring complexes known as the Younger Granites intruded [[Neoproterozoic]] and Paleozoic basement rocks in the Jos Plateau, as well as in the Air region in Niger. The Younger Granites are primarily alkali-feldpsar granites, although the ring complexes also include [[rhyolite]], gabbro and syenite. The ring dikes tend to be highly mineralized and enriched in [[niobium]] and tin. 

Large sedimentary basins formed in southern Nigeria, divided by the [[Okitipupa Ridge]]. The basins did not begin to fill with sediment until the [[Albian]] age of the [[Cretaceous]]. In the southeast, poorly bedded sandy shale alternates with layers of sandstone and sandy limestone, containing [[ammonite]], [[radiolarian]], [[echinoid]] and [[gastropod]] fossils. Subsequently, some of these sedimentary rock layers experienced lead and zinc mineralization. 

The [[arkose]] sandstone, limestone and shale of the 600 meter thick [[Odukpani Formation]] formed during the [[Cenomanian]] until the early [[Turonian]], in the vicinity of modern day Calabar. Fish teeth, ammonites and echinoids date the [[Eze-Aku Formation]] to the Turonian, while the blue-gray shales and [[marl]] limestone of the [[Awgu Formation]] dates to the [[Coniacian]]. During the [[Santonian]] age of the [[Cretaceous]], sea levels dropped. However, by the [[Campanian]] and the [[Maastrichtian]], the [[Nkporo Formation]] records shale, mudstone, limestone and sandstones formed in an offshore environment. In other parts of Nigeria, the [[Owelli Sandstone]], [[Enugu Shale]] and [[Asata Shale]] formed around the same time in shallow water environments. Other formations of similar age include the ammonite-bearing coals of [[Mamu Formation]] and the [[Nsukka Formation]], both from the Maastrichtian.

The Maastrichtian age brought a large marine transgression to southwest Nigeria, depositing the [[Abeokuta Formation]].
The [[Iullemeden Basin]], also known as the Sokoto Basin spans Mali, western Niger, northwest Nigeria and northern Benin and began accumulating sediments in the [[Jurassic]], followed by the Maastrichtian [[Rima Group]], which records a brackish environment. 
Approximately one-tenth of the [[Chad Basin]] is situated in Nigeria. Albian Bima sandstone lie unconformably atop Precambrian basement rock, followed by the Turonian limestone and shale sequences of the [[Gongila Formation]]. Marine shales of the [[Fika Formation]] formed during the Senonian. The Maastrichtian brought a shift to an estuary environment, leading to the deposition of the [[Gombe Sandstones]], which are intercalated with ironstone, siltstone and shales. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=197-198}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
High sea levels continued into the early [[Cenozoic]]. In the west, the [[Akinbo Formation]] and [[Ewekoro Formation]] both deposited in the [[Paleocene]], while the [[Ino Formation]] took shape atop the Nsukka in the east, with layers of thick, clay shale. 
The [[Sokoto Group]] in the [[Iullemeden Basin]] contains marine sediments. However, by the [[Eocene]], sea levels retreated and afterward Nigeria mainly experienced terrestrial sedimentation. 

Around the end of the Cretaceous and the start of the Cenozoic, the sedimentary rocks in the Chad Basin were folded into [[anticlines]] and [[synclines]]. Erosion created an [[unconformity]] with younger rocks. Terrestrial sediments built up in the Paleocene [[Kerri Kerri Formation]], followed by [[Pliocene]] lake sediments of the [[Chad Formation]]. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=198}}

==Hydrogeology==
Unconsolidated sediments 15 to 30 meters thick line the Niger and Benue rivers and are recharged from rainwater, along with the near surface, shallow aquifers of the Niger Delta Basin and the partially consolidated Benin Formation. In central and eastern Nigeria, regional occurrences of volcanic rock contain groundwater in fractures, less than five meters deep. 

Most of Nigeria's large sedimentary basins have intergranular flow, rainwater recharge and few water quality issues. Within the Chad Basin, the Chad Formation is unconfined in some locations, with artesian flow from some deeper layers and a water table depth of 10 to 15 meters. The Gombe Sandstone is comparatively low permeability and the deeper Kerri-Kerri Formation remains poorly studied. The water table in the Sokoto Group varies widely between 20 and 100 meters deep, unconfined near the surface and confined in lower layers of the Gwandu Formation. Within the Sokoto Group, the Wurno Formation has moderate yields and limited recharge, while the Gundumi Formation conglomerates are good aquifers, with artesian conditions, bounded by deeper clay layers. Other sedimentary aquifers include the Nupe Basin, Upper Benue Basin and Lower Benue Basin.

Precambrian crystalline basement rock supports regional aquifers in weathered zones, 10 to 25 meters thick, as well as in fractures. In particular, metasedimentary rocks often weather to be clay rich, forming [[aquitards]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Nigeria|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Nigeria#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Nigeria has extensive natural resources and is the largest crude oil producer in Africa and 20 billion barrels of reserves. As such, petroleum is central to [[economy of Nigeria]], producing 80 percent of government revenues and 95 percent of export earnings. Additionally, Nigeria has 2.6 trillion cubic meters of natural gas and a high overall gas to oil ratio. Seventy percent of both oil and gas resources are onshore. 

The country also has extensive mineral deposits, although most are under-exploited. According to the Geological Survey of Nigeria Agency, Nigeria has some 34 known major mineral deposits across the country. Exploration of solid minerals like tin, niobium, lead, zinc and gold, goes back for more than 90 years, but there has been a world-wide scale production of tin and niobium only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Obaje, Nuhu George |year=2009|title=Geology and Mineral Resources of Nigeria|publisher=Springer|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold mines were active before World War II, extracting from crystalline basement rock in the northwest, but a combination of low gold prices and legal turmoil ended the industry. The Younger Granites of the Jos Plateau contain significant tin deposits, mined since before European colonization. However, in recent years, tin mining has been significantly curtailed by flooding in the mines and low tin prices, as well as water pollution from the mines. [[Tantalite]] and [[columbite]] are both associated with the tin ore in the plateau.

The states of Anambra, Benue, Plateau and Taraba have small-scale lead and zinc mining, from deposits that also have large quantities of cadmium, arsenic and antimony. [[Barite]] veins commonly contain lead and zinc in [[Plateau State]] and other parts of eastern Nigeria. [[Kawara State]] has iron ore in Agbaja Plateau and Itakpe Hills. 

Nigeria also has other resources useful for energy and construction, including a poorly understood [[lignite]] belt in the south, [[kaolin]], [[gypsum]] and [[feldspar]]. Coal mining provided much of the country's energy between 1915 and 1960, although the industry has been in a long-running decline, now providing energy only for small-scale kilns and smelters. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=198}}

[[File:Prelucrare 3D pentru La Valletta Harbour.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Grand Harbour]]
The '''Grand Harbour''' ({{lang-mt|il-Port il-Kbir}}), also known as the '''Port of Valletta''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Port of Valletta|url=http://www.transport.gov.mt/ports-marinas/ports-in-malta/port-of-valletta|publisher=Transport Malta|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[natural harbour]] on the island of [[Malta]]. It has been substantially modified over the years with extensive [[Dock (maritime)|docks]], [[wharves]], and [[Fortification|fortifications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pullicino|first=Mark|date=2013|title=The Obama Tribe Explorer, James Martin's Biography|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=xRdnDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|publisher=MPI Publishing|isbn=978-99957-0-584-8|oclc=870266285|page=30-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Malta-gh-1.jpg|thumb|View of the Grand Harbour looking towards the sea]]
[[File:Malta-gh-2.jpg|thumb|View of the Grand Harbour looking towards Marsa]]
The harbour mouth faces north east and is bounded to the north by Saint Elmo Point and further sheltered by an isolated [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] and is bounded to the south by Ricasoli Point. Its north west shore is formed by the [[Sciberras peninsula]], which is largely covered by the city of [[Valletta]] and its [[suburb]] [[Floriana]]. This peninsula also divides Grand Harbour from a second parallel natural harbour, [[Marsamxett Harbour]]. The main waterway of Grand Harbour continues inland almost to [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]]. The southeastern shore of the harbour is formed by a number of inlets and headlands, principally Rinella Creek, Kalkara Creek, Dockyard Creek, and French Creek, which are covered by [[Kalkara]] and the [[Three Cities]]: [[Cospicua]], [[Birgu|Vittoriosa]], and [[Senglea]]. The harbour has been described as Malta's greatest geographic asset.&lt;ref name=agius&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agius|first1=Raymond|title=The Grand Harbour in Malta|url=http://www.agius.com/malta/harbour.htm|website=agius.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its partner harbour of Marsamxett, Grand Harbour lies at the centre of gently rising ground. Development has grown up all around the twin harbours and up the slopes so that the whole bowl is effectively one large [[conurbation]]. Much of Malta's population lives within a three kilometer radius of Floriana. This is now one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. The harbours and the surrounding areas make up Malta's [[Districts of Malta#Northern Harbour District|Northern]] and [[Districts of Malta#Southern Harbour District|Southern Harbour District]]s. Together, these districts contain 27 of 68 [[Local councils of Malta|local councils]]. They have a population of 213,722 which make up over 47% of the total population of the Maltese islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estimated Population by Locality 31st March, 2013|url=http://www.lc.gov.mt/mediacenter/PDFs/1_Population%2031-3-13.pdf|publisher=Malta Government Gazette 19,094|accessdate=31 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184236/http://www.lc.gov.mt/mediacenter/PDFs/1_Population%2031-3-13.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Port de La Valette vers 1750 Malte.jpg|thumb|The Grand Harbour in 1750]]

The Maltese islands have [[History of Malta|a long history]], mainly due to its strategic location and natural harbours, mainly the Grand Harbour as well as Marsamxett. The Grand Harbour has in fact been used since prehistoric times.

Megalithic remains have been found on the shores of the Grand Harbour. The [[Kordin Temples]], the earliest of which date back to around 3700 BC, overlooked the harbour from Corradino Heights.&lt;ref name=KordinIII&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vella|first1=Nicholas C.|title=The Prehistoric Temples at Kordin III|date=2004|publisher=Heritage Books|location=[[Santa Venera]]|isbn=9993239879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another megalithic structure possibly existed underwater off Fort Saint Angelo, but this can no longer be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coppens|first1=Philip|title=Malta: the small island of the giants|url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/malta.html|website=philipcoppens.com|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punic and Roman remains were also found on the shores of the harbour.&lt;ref name=KordinIII/&gt;

By the 12th and 13th centuries, the ''[[Fort St Angelo|Castrum Maris]]'' had been built in what is now [[Birgu]]. It might have been built instead of ancient buildings, possibly Phoenician or Roman temples, or an Arab fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort St Angelo|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/malta/vittoriosa/sights/military/fort-st-angelo|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1283, the [[Battle of Malta]] was fought at the entrance of the Grand Harbour. [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] forces defeated a larger [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] force and captured 10 galleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=Frans|title=The Battle of Malta 730 years ago|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130630/life-features/The-Battle-of-Malta-730-years-ago.476209|accessdate=5 November 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Harbour was the base for the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] for 268 years, from 1530 to 1798. They settled in the city of [[Birgu]] and improved its fortifications, including rebuilding the ''Castrum Maris'' as [[Fort St Angelo|Fort Saint Angelo]]. In July 1551, Barbary corsairs and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces [[Invasion of Gozo (1551)#Malta|raided Malta]]. They landed at Marsamxett and marched upon the Grand Harbour, but did not attack as they found the town of Birgu too well fortified to attack. Although this attempt was unsuccessful, the Ottoman force later managed to [[Invasion of Gozo (1551)|sack Gozo]] and [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|conquer Tripoli]] within the same campaign. After the attack, [[Fort Saint Elmo]] and [[Fort Saint Michael]] were built to better protect the harbour in any future attacks. The city of [[Senglea]] was also founded soon afterwards.

Later on in the 1550s, a [[Valletta, Malta tornado|tornado]] struck the Grand Harbour, killing 600 people and destroying a shipping armada.

The area was the scene of much of the fighting in the [[Great Siege of Malta]] of 1565 when the Ottomans attempted to eject the Order of St John but were ultimately defeated. After the siege, the capital city of [[Valletta]] was built on the Sciberras peninsula on the north west shore of the harbour. Over the years, more fortifications and settlements were founded within the Grand Harbour, including [[Fort Ricasoli]] and the towns of [[Floriana]] and [[Cospicua]].

[[File:The New Dock at Malta, Illustrated London News, 24 October 1867.png|thumb|New dock built in 1867]]
During the [[French occupation of Malta]], the harbour area was blockaded by Maltese rebels on land and the [[Royal Navy]] at sea. The French eventually capitulated in September 1800 and Malta became a [[Malta Protectorate|British protectorate]], later a [[Malta Colony|colony]]. During the British colonial rule, the harbour became a strategic base for the Royal Navy and the base of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]].

[[File:HMS Rodney 1943 Malta.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Rodney (29)|HMS ''Rodney'']] in the harbour during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]].]]
The whole area was savagely bombed during the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Second Siege of Malta]] during [[World War II]], as the docks and military installations around the [[port]] became targets for [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[bombers]]. However [[collateral damage]] wrecked much of Valletta and The Three Cities, and caused large numbers of [[civilian casualties]]. 
[[File:HMS Victorious Malta 1967.jpg|thumb|[[NATO]] warships in the harbour during 1967.]]
[[Malta Dockyard]] is still active but with the departure of the [[British Military]] the harbour lost much of its military significance. A considerable part of Malta's [[Trade|commercial]] [[shipping]] is now handled by the new [[free port]] at [[Marsaxlokk|Kalafrana]], so the harbour is much quieter than it was in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bugeja|first1=Lino|title=The historical importance of Malta’s Grand Harbour|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130811/life-features/The-historical-importance-of-Malta-s-Grand-Harbour.481865|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A Vision for Malta's Grand Harbour ===

The Grand Harbour, the backdrop to Malta's history, is set to experience a regeneration as in September 2007, the [[Maltese Government 2003–08|Maltese Government]] unveiled 20 proposed projects that would revamp the area while respecting its historic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government’s Vision for Grand Harbour will generate jobs and investment – MEA|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2007-09-08/news/governments-vision-for-grand-harbour-will-generate-jobs-and-investment-mea-178950/|accessdate=5 November 2014|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
HERE has built its mapping and location business by acquiring location technology and know-how: the company is a combination of what was formerly ''[[Navteq]]'' and ''Nokia Maps''.

===Navteq===
''[[Navteq]]'' (styled "NAVTEQ"), was an American company founded in 1985 as '''Karlin &amp; Collins, Inc.''', later known as '''Navigation Technologies Corporation''' and eventually as Navteq. At the time of its acquisition by Nokia, Navteq was the largest maker of automotive grade map data used in car navigation equipment.&lt;ref name="reardon1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reardon|first=Marguerite|url=http://news.cnet.com/Nokia-to-buy-Navteq-for-8.1-billion/2100-1039_3-6210911.html|title=Nokia to buy Navteq for $8.1 billion|publisher=[[CNET News]]|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infoworld navteq 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Niccolai|first=James|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/10/01/Nokia-buys-mapping-service-for-8.1-billion_1.html|title=Nokia buys mapping service for $8.1 billion|publisher=InfoWorld|date=1 October 2007|accessdate=6 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108214104/http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/10/01/Nokia-buys-mapping-service-for-8.1-billion_1.html|archivedate=8 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc navteq 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7022527.stm|title=Nokia to buy digital map company|publisher=BBC News|date=1 October 2007|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg navteq 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Erkheikki|first=Juho|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=aofyAChPI4TM|title=Nokia to Buy Navteq for $8.1 Billion, Take on TomTom|work=Bloomberg|date=1 October 2007|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nokia Maps===
Nokia Maps began in 2001 as [[Smart2Go]], a generic 3D-map interface for access to tourist information on mobile terminals. It was developed by an EU consortium named [[TellMaris]].&lt;ref name="cordis development 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=PROJ_ICT&amp;ACTION=D&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;RCN=57180|title=Tellmaris: Development of a 3D-map interface for tourist information on mobile computers, 5th FWP, ICT Research, European Commission, June 2001. $3.49EUR million|work=Europa (web portal)|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia gained the rights to the software when it acquired [[Berlin]]-based [[route planning software]] company [[Gate 5]] in August 2006, which has become the cornerstone for the company's mapping business.&lt;ref name="Nokia acquire g5 1"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://company.nokia.com/en/news/press-releases/2006/08/31/nokia-acquires-gate5-to-add-robust-mapping-and-navigation-to-its-devices|title=Nokia acquires gate5 to add robust mapping and navigation to its devices|publisher=Nokia|date=31 August 2006|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then made the Smart2Go application free to download.&lt;ref name="Nokia smart2go 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1103306|title=Nokia Press Release – Nokia Delivers Free Downloadable Maps to the Mobile World|publisher=Nokia.com|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nokia smart2go 2"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://company.nokia.com/en/news/press-releases/2007/02/15/run-on-nokias-mapping-and-navigation-application-smart2go|title=Nokia Press Release – Run on Nokia's mapping and navigation application smart2go|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reghardware smart2go 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2007/02/08/nokia_frees_smart2go|title=Nokia Frees Smart2Go|date=8 February 2007|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAS here 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/4875_Nokia_announce_free_Maps_solut.php|title=Nokia announce free Maps (smart2go) solution|publisher=AllAboutSymbian|date=8 February 2007|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquirer here 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/02/08/nokia-to-offer-free-mapping-software|title=The Inquirer – Nokia to offer free mapping software|date=8 February 2007|accessdate=6 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528052328/http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/02/08/nokia-to-offer-free-mapping-software|archivedate=28 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition by Nokia===
In October 2007, [[Nokia]] acquired the Chicago-based company [[Navteq]], which brought 25 years of experience in creating automotive grade map content, and a deep footprint in the automotive industry.&lt;ref name="reardon1" /&gt; Nokia ran Navteq's business along with their own '''Nokia Maps''' (later known as '''Ovi Maps''', then again as Nokia Maps from 2011). The two divisions remained as separate entities of Nokia Corporation until Navteq was amalgamated into the core Nokia operations in 2011. The service was rebranded as H in 2012, bringing together mapping, location businesses, satellite navigation and other services under one brand.&lt;ref name="Nokia blog naming 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lumiaconversations.microsoft.com/2011/05/16/the-evolution-of-nokia-and-ovi/|title=The evolution of Nokia and Ovi|date=16 May 2011|publisher=Microsoft Mobile|accessdate=24 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221924/http://lumiaconversations.microsoft.com/2011/05/16/the-evolution-of-nokia-and-ovi/|archivedate=31 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/nokia-sells-here-maps-business-to-carmaker-consortium-of-audi-bmw-and-daimler/#ftag=CAD590a51e/|title=Nokia sells Here maps business to carmakers Audi, BMW and Daimler|date=3 August 2015|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=German-Caremakers-Complete-HERE-acquisition&gt;{{cite news|last=Rastogi|first=Ishaan|title=Daimler, BMW, and Audi Acquire Nokia's HERE in $2.78 Billion Deal.|url=http://auto.ndtv.com/news/daimler-bmw-and-audi-acquire-nokia-s-here-in-278-billion-deal-1252298|newspaper=NDTV|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further acquisitions and development===
In 2008, Nokia picked up geo social networking site [[Plazes]] and the following year it bought mobile applications developer [[Bit-Side]], social location pioneer [[Plum]], and social travel service [[Dopplr]]. In 2010, it acquired [[Metacarta]] a leading enterprise local search service used by security and military.

In April 2011, Nokia released a beta version of 3D maps that covered 20 cities in the world. By August 2011, the coverage has expanded to 23 cities, and in 2012, Nokia bought [[EarthMine]], which specialises in street level 3D image capture.&lt;ref name="Nokia 3D 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/11/13/innovating-modern-map-making-with-earthmine|title=Innovating modern map making with Earthmine|publisher=Nokia|date=13 November 2012|accessdate=6 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117221258/http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/11/13/innovating-modern-map-making-with-earthmine/|archive-date=17 November 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, ''Ovi Maps'' was renamed to ''Nokia Maps'' when Nokia streamlined its services offering.&lt;ref name="cnet renaming 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/nokia-ovi-services-renamed-as-maps-email-and-app-store-get-a-make-ovi/|title=Nokia Ovi services renamed, as maps, email and app store get a make-Ovi|publisher=CNET UK|date=16 May 2011|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Maps &amp; Drive for [[Windows Phone 7]] (Mango) was announced, which was available on [[Nokia Lumia]] phones ([[Nokia Lumia 710|710]], [[Nokia Lumia 800|800]] and in 2012, the [[Nokia Lumia 900|900]]). However, major features such as off-line routing and text-to-speech navigation of street names, compared to the Symbian version, were absent.&lt;ref name="ICM features 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic-mobile.com/blogs/97-nokia-in-2011-a-royal-wedding-without-belle-and-whistles|title=A Royal Wedding without Belle and Whistles|date=2 November 2011|publisher=IC-Mobile|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107034517/http://www.ic-mobile.com/blogs/97-nokia-in-2011-a-royal-wedding-without-belle-and-whistles|archivedate=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features were eventually brought over to the [[Windows Phone]] platform in 2012.

===Rebranding===
On 13 November 2012, Nokia announced that it would rebrand its location offering as ''HERE'' to highlight its vision for the future of location-based services and its belief in the importance of mapping.&lt;ref name="ATD rebrand 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20121113/nokia-maps-a-course-for-its-location-business-unveils-here-cloud-service|title=Nokia Maps a Course for Its Location Business, Unveils "HERE" Cloud Service|publisher=[[AllThingsD]]|date=13 November 2012|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="register rebrand 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/27/nokiareal_world_search|title=Nokia wants to build the Google of human behaviour – and share it|publisher=The Register|date=27 February 2013|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TC rebrand 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/nokia-introduces-here-a-rebranding-of-its-maps-service-that-goes-head-to-head-with-google|title=Nokia Introduces HERE, A Rebranding of Its Maps Service That Goes Head-to-Head With Google|last=Etherington|first=Darrell|date=13 November 2012|work=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, HERE announced that it had acquired [[Medio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/12/nokias-here-buys-medio-systems-for-more-personalised-location-services/|title=Nokia’s Here Buys Medio Systems To Push More Personalised Location Services|publisher=Techcrunch|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Seattle-based start-up that specialized in predictive analytics.

In 2014, [[Windows Phone]]'s low market share, as well as the end of Nokia's partnership with Microsoft, led to the company prioritizing [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2014/09/26/nokias-here-maps-now-prioritizing-android-and-ios-development-over-windows-phone/|title=Nokia's HERE Maps now prioritizing Android and iOS development over Windows Phone - MobileSyrup.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition by car companies===
On 3 August 2015, HERE was sold to a consortium of [[Germany|German]] car makers [[Volkswagen Group|Audi]], [[BMW]], and [[Daimler AG|Mercedes]]. On 4 December 2015, the consortium completed the acquisition for 2.8 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-here-idUSKBN0TN1J020151204|title=Finland's Nokia closes maps unit sale to German car makers|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters-intel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Intel to take stake in German mapping firm HERE in automated driving push|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-here-equity-idUSKBN14N0RN|accessdate=4 January 2017|agency=Reuters|publisher=Reuters.com|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2015 the company had 6500 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/12/07/new-world-here/|title=Starting today, it’s a new world for HERE... - HERE 360|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Navinfo, [[Tencent]] and [[GIC Private Limited]] (the Singapore sovereign wealth fund) agreed to buy a 10% stake in HERE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.here.com/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2017-10-01-68|title=NavInfo, Tencent and GIC to invest in HERE; companies to develop location services for Chinese market|work=Road Show by HERE|access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But in September 2017, the offer of the three companies failed, as US authorities did not authorize the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-26/chinese-bid-for-stake-in-here-maps-denied-by-u-s-security-panel|title=Chinese Bid for Stake in Mapping Firm Denied by U.S. Panel|work=Road Show by [[Bloomberg News]]|access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 it was reported that [[Intel]] was taking a 15% stake in the firm.&lt;ref name="reuters-intel" /&gt; In September 2017, Here and [[Pioneer Corporation]] have reached an agreement in which HERE would acquire approximately 3% of Pioneer’s stock at a value of €17.3 million. In parallel, at the same cost, Pioneer would acquire less than 1% of HERE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://360.here.com/here-and-pioneer-forming-a-new-partnership|title=HERE and Pioneer, forming a new partnership|work=Road Show by HERE|access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisitions by HERE ===
In November 2017, HERE announced it would acquire Advanced Telematic Systems for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-here-ats/digital-mapping-company-here-to-acquire-ats-in-connected-car-play-idUSKBN1DS26T|title=Digital mapping company HERE to acquire ATS in connected-car play|last=|first=|date=2017-11-18|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automotive services==

===HERE Auto===
The 2016 [[Jaguar Cars]] XF and XJ models incorporate HERE drive guidance in their in-car infotainment systems. All of the features of the HERE suite are available to the driver, including maps, navigation, and social sharing using Glympse. This is all available on either eight, ten or 12.3-inch display screens within the car itself (screen size dependent on model). A hallmark feature of HERE Auto is the ability to plan the journey right from the Android or iOS app before entering the car, and seamless guidance to the final destination after parking the car. What sets HERE Auto apart from competitors such as [[Android Auto]] and [[CarPlay]] is its nature of being contextually aware, rather than just a screen mirroring solution. Country and region maps are also able to be downloaded directly to the flash-based storage of the HERE Auto system itself, much like the ability to store offline maps on devices using the Android/iOS HERE apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/373890/2016-jaguar-xf-incontrol-touch-explained/|title=2016 Jaguar XF InControl Touch explained|work=CarAdvice.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/06/17/jaguar-xj-here-auto/|title=The new Jaguar XJ debuts with HERE Auto guidance|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HERE MapCare===
HERE MapCare was first implemented with [[Volvo]] vehicles in 2009, and has since spread to at least 23 other manufacturers (such as Hyundai, Mazda and Mitsubishi) utilising HERE maps data in their infotainment systems. HERE map data is updated for around a period of three years from the date of purchase of the vehicle, and is performed at the time of service from the car dealer. There is also the option of updating maps data via USB memory stick or memory card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/03/23/free-map-updates-for-your-car-with-here-mapcare/|title=Free map updates for your car with HERE MapCare|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HERE and other car manufacturers / mapping companies===
HERE maps data and technologies are also integrated in the technologies of other car and company companies. Some prominent examples are listed below:

[[Garmin]] has been using '''HERE''' for its mapping system since the days its been branded as '''NAVTEQ'''. With its recent models of [[Garmin]] GPS navigation units, HERE has facilitated and used DAB to broadcast live traffic information free to users. This is done through the power cable of the GPS unit acting as an antenna, and provides enough data with low latency, allowing data to be updated in very fast intervals. This is in comparison to data charges stemming from using devices with a SIM card to provide this same level of detailed traffic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/03/26/all-we-hear-is-radio-garmin-here-is-tuned-into-dab/|title=All we hear is Radio Garmin: HERE is tuned into DAB|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MyFord Mobile from the [[Ford|Ford Motor Company]] has its location services powered by HERE mapping data, allowing users to find their parked cars remotely from the relevant iOS or Android app. Routes for driving are also able to be planned on the phone itself and sent to the car ready to be enacted. Charging station locations for electric vehicles already inherent in the HERE mapping database are also included in the calculation of routes to be driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/03/02/myford-mobile-puts-power-electric-cars-hands/|title=MyFord Mobile puts the power of electric cars in your hands|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HERE also has a presence at major motor trade shows around the globe. For example, at the ''Mondial de l’Automobile 2014'' show in Paris, HERE had its maps in 50 of the 62 cars on show. HERE also attends other major trade shows such as CES in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/01/05/bmw-unveil-future-driving-ces/|title=BMW and HERE unveil the future of driving at CES|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New technologies===
HERE also conducts work on various new technologies to improve traffic, mapping and the experience of driving. Listed below are recent prominent examples of these:

In August 2015, HERE introduced a new traffic-jam warning system called Traffic Safety Warning. The system works in alerting the driver with a suitable time period to react to the fact that there is a traffic jam up ahead. Data is updated every minute and is yet another way in which data collected is used to the benefit and safety of drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/08/06/traffic-safety-warning/|title=Slow down! HERE introduces its Traffic Safety Warning system|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, HERE published an interface specification named the Sensor Ingestion Interface Specification. This standard defines how sensor data gathered by vehicles on the road can be sent to the cloud to update maps on the fly. The premise of the technology is to allow for the collection of data to alert other cars on the road to traffic obstacles or accidents in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/06/23/here-sensor-data-ingestion/|title=HERE shares how automated cars can ‘heal’ maps on the fly|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; HERE has called for leading car manufacturers from across the world to promote its specification and call for a standardised data format, thereby leading to all consumers receiving the same traffic data reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/08/24/here-rallies-car-industry-to-agree-on-common-data-format/|title=HERE rallies car industry to agree on common data format|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HERE also works in the field of automated vehicles, with the recent provision of its HD Map data for manufacturers in testing their vehicles. The highly accurate mapped data of private test tracks provides these cars with a highly accurate navigation system to complement data collected from on-board sensors. Much like existing map data is collected for consumer driving, the same LiDAR technology is used to map these private test tracks along with the roads that are used for public testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/07/20/here-introduces-hd-maps-for-highly-automated-vehicle-testing/|title=HERE introduces HD maps for highly automated vehicle testing|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; HD Map data is also highly accurate, with accuracy to a level of 10 to 20 centimetres, and the collection of lane geometry is also part of the data collection task. HERE makes approximately 2.7 million changes to its global map database every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/04/16/autonomous-cars-can-understand-real-world-map/|title=Autonomous cars can only understand the real world through a map|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also part of the field of autonomous vehicles and automated driving is the Live Roads technology. HERE is currently developing such a technology that will be able to alert drivers of conditions such as weather to alert other drivers of possible hazards, or to avoid a particular area whilst driving. An example is the aggregation of data from windshield wipers and slipping tyres to notify other drivers to avoid an ice-filled area. The company is also investigating Humanised Driving where data is collected on driving habits on roads, and provisioning this data to allow automated cars to follow how drivers behave (speed, traffic lights etc.) when driving on certain roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/04/23/humanized-driving/|title=How to humanize the autonomous car|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HERE has also worked with [[:de:Swarco Traffic Holding|SWARCO Group]] {{de icon}} in developing new technologies for intelligent speed guidance. Through the smart provision of traffic lights and management, traffic congestion and vehicle efficiency will be able to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2014/09/08/here-swarco-traffic-lights/|title=HERE works with SWARCO on the next generation of traffic lights|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer services==

===HERE WeGo===
{{Main|HERE WeGo}}

HERE WeGo, formerly Nokia Maps and HERE Maps, is a consumer mapping application that works on smartphones or through a web browser. It is currently available in 196 countries and its features include turn-by-turn walking navigation, offline availability, 3D landmarks and indoor Venue Maps for 100,000+ unique buildings in 87 countries. A favourite's list shows the top 25 most popular places in the vicinity looking at positive reviews, search queries and other user data. The application is also integrated with an augmented reality technology called LiveSight that lets users hold up their phone to reveal information about the buildings including contact information, hours and reviews in their line of sight from the phone camera display.&lt;ref name="Nokia experiences 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/11/13/livesight-immersive-experiences-you-can-act-on|title=LiveSight: immersive experiences you can act on|last=Bonetti|first=Pino|date=13 November 2012|work=Nokia Conversations Blog|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=5 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714041923/http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/11/13/livesight-immersive-experiences-you-can-act-on/|archive-date=14 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, HERE announced the decision to open up its location platform to all operating systems so that anyone with any kind of device could access it. With an open platform Here broadens its reach and acquires more users, which in turn generates more data for its location cloud.&lt;ref name="Nokia all OS 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/11/13/ios-android-firefox-os-here-is-available-everywhere|title=iOS, Android,|first=Pino|last=Bonetti|date=13 November 2012|work=Nokia Conversations Blog|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=5 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509093234/http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/11/13/ios-android-firefox-os-here-is-available-everywhere/|archive-date=9 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time all OS 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/11/13/nokias-here-maps-everywhere|title=Nokia's HERE: Maps, Everywhere|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=13 November 2012|publisher=Time Tech|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here developed a HERE Maps API for Android which is available to partners. Apps built with the HERE Android API will be able to interact with extruded 3D buildings, search for specific buildings and preview their routes in detail.

In November 2012, HERE created an [[HTML5]]-based web service for iOS. The free app provides iPhone users with maps in almost 200 countries as well as public transit, walking and driving directions. Voice guided navigation is available for walking directions. It also provides multiple map views including a satellite view, public transportation view and live traffic view. HERE Maps on iOS received lukewarm praise mostly because it was a web application and not a native one.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Here Maps for iOS got multiple bad reviews from the start stating it was "a mess", "a wreck", "unfinished", "buggy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wired Gadgetlab Hands on Nokia HERE Maps App|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/11/hands-on-nokia-here-maps-app/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "rushed out HTML5-powered turkey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maclife HERE Maps Review|url=http://www.maclife.com/article/reviews/here_maps_review}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was pulled from the App Store in December 2013, after having not been updated for 10 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2013/12/29/nokia_removes_here_maps_app_from_ios_app_store_due_to_incompatibility_with_ios_7|title=Afterdawn: Nokia removes HERE Maps App from iOS App Store}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HERE web site was offered as replacement, however as of December 2014, Here noted that they plan to "officially launch HERE for iOS in early 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HERE for Android now available for free on Google Play|url=http://360.here.com/2014/12/10/android-now-available-free-google-play/|author=Jere Suikkila|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HERE was re-launched as a true app designed for iOS application on 11 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HERE – the leading offline navigation app – now on iOS |url=http://360.here.com/2015/03/11/here-for-ios/|date=11 March 2015|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Previous iterations====

=====HERE (Windows)=====
HERE makes its location-based assets, such as offline maps, available for the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform through a dedicated Windows SDK&lt;ref name="Nokia SDK 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://conversations.nokia.com/2013/02/19/comparing-offline-capabilities-of-nokia-maps-and-google-maps|title=Comparing offline capabilities of Nokia Maps and Google Maps|last=Bonetti|first=Pino|date=19 February 2013|work=Nokia Conversations Blog|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the suite runs on Windows, users can save their favourite destinations as live tiles to their start screen and the app will calculate routes based on current location. The suite is integrated so that users can access individual functions going from one app to the next without going back to the home screen. Favourites are saved to the cloud so that they can be accessed on all of the different applications.

In February 2013, Nokia announced that HERE Maps, HERE Drive and HERE Transit would be available on all Windows devices at the Windows Store.&lt;ref name="Nokia W8 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://conversations.nokia.com/2013/02/26/here-maps-here-drive-and-here-transit-for-other-windows-phone-8-smartphones|title=HERE Maps, HERE Drive and HERE Transit for other Windows Phone 8 smartphones|last=Bonetti|first=Pino|date=26 February 2013|work=Nokia Conversations Blog|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=5 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510042141/http://conversations.nokia.com/2013/02/26/here-maps-here-drive-and-here-transit-for-other-windows-phone-8-smartphones/|archive-date=10 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HERE Drive''' provides navigation designed for in car driving in 94 countries. Its features include visual and audio speed limit warnings, voice guided [[turn-by-turn navigation]] with spoken street names (optional) in more than 60 countries in 50 different languages and offline availability. The user interface is designed for drivers and map data includes 260 attributes such as turn restrictions, physical barriers and one-way streets. HERE Drive and HERE Drive+ have optional live traffic information where available, but both lack dynamic rerouting, which is restricted to everyday commuting in a few countries only and then does not come with voice guidance.

'''HERE Transit''' has public transportation information for more than 700 cities in 50 countries. It combines bus, train, ferry, tram and walking information in one application.

[[File:Nokia City Lens screenshot.png|thumb|320px|right|Demonstrating Here City Lens on a [[Nokia Lumia 920]] through a PureView camera]]

'''HERE City Lens''' is [[augmented reality]] (AR) software that gives dynamic information, through the phone’s camera display, about users' surroundings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mashable.com/2012/09/05/nokia-city-lens/|title=Nokia’s City Lens Hopes to Make Augmented Reality Mainstream|publisher=Mashable, Inc|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as shops, restaurants, and points of interest, shown as virtual signs overlaid on or above buildings. A commercial Beta version was released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://betalabs.nokia.com/trials/nokia-city-lens-for-windows-phone|title=Nokia City Lens for Windows Phone|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has free of charge turn-by-turn voice guided navigation, Here Drive 3.0 (earlier ''Nokia Drive''), which can also be used without internet connection using preloaded maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/07/20/nokia-drive-3-arrives-with-my-commute/|title=Nokia Drive 3.0 arrives with My Commute, your Lumia is no excuse for being late|work=Engadget |publisher=AOL Inc.|author=Jon Fingas|date=20 July 2012|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to de-clutter the surroundings: version 1.5 has a "Sightline" feature where users can narrow their view to just what is in the direct line of sight, making it easier to spot interesting places.

HERE City Lens is powered by [[Bing Maps]], and Nokia introduced [[Here Prime Place]] for listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Infant|first=Raj|title=Getting listed in Nokia City Lens|url=http://www.onwebtoday.com/add-business-stores-nokia-city-lens-nokia-maps/|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newest release has 3D icons and the ability to disable places which are not within the camera's line of sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia reveals new City Lens augmented reality app for Windows Phone 8 lineup|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/09/11/nokia-reveals-new-city-lens-for-windows-phone-8/ |work=Engadget|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2016, HERE announced that it would discontinue support for its app for [[Windows 10 Mobile]] on 29 March 2016 due to its use of "a workaround that will no longer be effective after June 30, 2016", and that the existing Windows Phone 8 app will only receive critical updates after this date and no longer be actively developed.&lt;ref name="verge-herenomorewin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Here Maps drops support for Windows Phone and Windows 10|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11234462/here-maps-support-windows-phone-windows-10|website=The Verge|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Symbian=====&lt;!--- Symbian and Asha versions are relevant to the subject as Nokia Maps used to be exclusive to what were at the time Nokia (now Microsoft Mobile Oy) platforms, also as I've told the Indian IP author before just because a product isn't currently supported doesn't mean that we should immediately delete it from Wikipedia in the name of "updation", please keep the Symbian and Asha sections intact, also the usage of past tense indicate that its availability is historic and not current so deleting them does not equal "updation" ---&gt;
Here was available on [[Symbian]] platform under the previous names of '''Nokia Maps''', and '''Ovi Maps'''. The latest, and the last, version 3.09 included:

*Driving and walking turn-by-turn with international voice guidance.
*Live traffic rerouting in some countries.
*Live traffic visualisation on the map in some countries.
*Third-party content such as [[ViaMichelin]] and [[Lonely Planet]].
*[[Social networking service]] integration.
*Support for preloading street maps for offline use.
*Users can report errors in the maps (from version 3.03 except on [[Nokia E66]] and [[Nokia E71|E71]] models)&lt;ref name="Nokia errors 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Map reporter FAQ |url=http://www.nokia.com/za-en/support/faq/?action=singleFAQ&amp;caseid=FA133108_en_US }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nokia blog errors 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Custom 3.03 version for Nokia E71 and Nokia E66|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/11363_Nokia_E71_and_E66_get_Ovi_Maps.php|author=Rafe Blandford|date=6 April 2010|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Local weather conditions by the hour and forecasts for the week.

Nokia stated that the Nokia 808 from 2012, would be the last Symbian phone.&lt;ref name="TC last Symbian phone 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/24/nokia-confirms-the-pure-view-was-officially-the-last-symbian-phone|title=Nokia Confirms The PureView Was Officially The Last Symbian Phone|publisher=[[Techcrunch]]|date=24 January 2013|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbian development has halted, therefore no new features for Nokia Maps are to be expected. [[Accenture]] is responsible for maintenance of [[Symbian]] and Nokia Maps until 2016.&lt;ref name="phonearena AR 1"/&gt;

The supported phones are:

*Version 3.09 (12 November 2012, also called Maps Suite 2.0): only for [[Symbian Belle]] phones (500, 603, 700, 701, N8-00, E7-00, C7-00, C6-01, X7-00, E6-00)
*Version 3.08 (15 November 2011) and 3.07: supported on Symbian^3
*Version 3.06 (2 December 2010): Symbian S60v5 (N97, N97 mini, X6, C6-00, 5800XM, 5235 &amp; 5230, etc.)
*Version 3.04 (20 May 2010): Symbian S60v3 FP2

===== Series 40 (S40) =====
Maps for the [[Series 40]] platform (such as early phones from the [[Nokia Asha series]]) were limited compared to other platforms. The maps were streamed online into the device or pre-downloaded with [[Nokia Suite]]. In some markets, the phones came with a SD card with preloaded local maps. They mostly did not have turn-by-turn navigation, and pedestrian routes were limited to {{convert|10|km|mi}} length. As none of the Asha series phones had GPS, positioning was done by [[Cell ID]] of the cellular network or by using the [[Wi-Fi positioning system]]. An exception was the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition, which was an S40 phone with GPS and full turn by turn voice navigation.

====Other mobile application platforms====
HERE is the default map software on [[Ubuntu Touch]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://insights.ubuntu.com/2014/07/30/nokia-here-maps-coming-to-ubuntu/ Nokia HERE maps coming to Ubuntu] 30 July 2014.

It is available on [[Firefox OS]].

===HERE Map Creator===
HERE Map Creator (http://mapcreator.here.com) is a service launched in November 2012 to allow users to update the HERE map. The service is available for more than 100 countries and in 47 languages. It can be accessed from their website mapcreator.here.com and dedicated HERE Map Creator Android and iPhone apps.

Users are able to add new roads (trails are included here), edit a road or remove it, add a new place, edit a place or remove it and finally add a house number, edit or remove it. In addition, users can edit road details such as speed limits, number of lanes, 1 or 2 way, type "open road", "tunnel" or "bridge", pavement type, etc. and also add local shops and businesses into various categories such as a grocery store, clothing store, types of restaurants (including cuisine and name of food joint), sports equipment store among several other categories and sub categories. and give various details about them including photos, contact nos., addresses, hours and days of operations in a week, payment info in the shops (whether they accept cash, cards, discount coupons or not). Users can also report map changes. Tutorial videos and instructions to carrying out the editing operations are available on their website.

==Enterprise services==

===Utilisation of HERE services===
HERE provides mapping data and assistance to many customers in the enterprise sector. One of these services powered by HERE mapping data and geocoding is the FC.frameLOGIC fuel control system by frameLOGIC, which uses fuel probes installed in the vehicle fuel tank to detect discrepancies and ultimately from three to ten percent on their fuel expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/08/13/how-fleet-managers-can-combat-fuel-loss/|title=How fleet managers can combat fuel loss|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another company making use of HERE data is MapMechanics, whose Truckstops VRS solution engages HERE real-time traffic and historical data patterns to plan ahead and factor in events such as transit strikes, to in turn re-route drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/08/07/transit-strikes-affect-companies-not-just-commuters/|title=Transit strikes affect companies, not just commuters|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sygic is another truck company that uses HERE map data for its Truck Navigation software, depending on its accuracy and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/05/26/sygic-chooses-truck-navigation/|title=Sygic chooses HERE for its Truck Navigation|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pertinent examples of companies using HERE for their services are Aramex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/04/27/aramex-how-do-you-deliver-packages-without-an-address/|title=How do you deliver packages without an address?|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; TimoCom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/05/04/here-timocom/|title=HERE helps fleets to keep on truckin' without empty runs - HERE 360|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; we-do-IT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/04/22/we-do-it-latlongo/|title=HERE offline maps help field workers get the job done|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amadeus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/01/13/flight-attendant-amadeus-aims-put-end-airline-rage/|title=Flight attendant: how Amadeus aims to put an end to airline rage|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maps4News&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/01/12/maps4news-puts-maps-front-page-newspapers/|title=Maps4News puts HERE maps on the front page of the newspapers|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Baidu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2014/12/12/baidu-keep-chinese-travellers-map/|title=Baidu and HERE keep Chinese travellers on the map|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HERE Traffic Analytics===
In July 2015, HERE launched HERE Traffic Analytics, which helps companies to plan for the effects of traffic on projects such as road construction. With the giant silo of data available, HERE has made current and retrospective data available for business customers to be constructed, tailored and extracted to the customers' requirements. Giving such granular control over the data allows for customers to use this data for the purposes they require, and the amount of detail and control needed for projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/07/23/here-launches-traffic-analytics-service-for-transportation-agencies-and-enterprise/|title=Introducing Traffic Analytics for agencies and commerce|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HERE Mobile SDK and HERE Data Lens===
The HERE Mobile SDK was launched in February 2014, and in the time since has expanded to add more functionality for developers. There are many customers using HERE mapping data as the backbone for their mobile apps, and the SDK provides access to information such as average road speeds, traffic build-up, and maximum loads that can be transported on a particular road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/01/19/building-blocks-better-business-apps-mobile-sdk-matures/|title=Building blocks for better business apps: HERE Mobile SDK matures|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been even more features and access added in each iteration of the SDK, with the latest 3.0 version launching in mid-2015. In the ''HERE Mobile SDK Starter Edition 3.0'', there are native Android and iOS APIs for raster tile map display, online points of interest search, geocoding/reverse geocoding and online pedestrian/car route calculation. ''HERE Mobile SDK Premium Edition 3.0'' extends the functionality to include vector maps, turn-by-turn guidance, truck routing, 3D venue maps and augmented reality. Offline Enterprise Maps (for truck attributes and congestion zones) and LiveSight pedestrian guidance are also provided in this latest version of the SDK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/07/20/try-the-new-here-mobile-sdk-for-free/|title=Try the new HERE Mobile SDK for free|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; HERE Data Lens is another service launched by HERE whereby customers can visualise their usage of data on a map in a visual form. This pictorial representation provides for extended analysis of datasets and how they are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2015/03/02/image-worth-1000-numbers-data-lens/|title=A map is worth 1000 numbers with HERE Data Lens|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HERE Maps coverage.png|thumb|320px|Coverage of street-level views in HERE Maps. Partial coverage (blue) and "full or partial coverage planned" (orange).]]

HERE draws on more than 80,000 data sources including a vehicle fleet, which collects data through panoramic cameras, position sensors and laser technology for 3D footprints. The cars have an array of cameras, which capture 360-degree street views and LIDAR sensors, which capture 1.3 billion data points every minute. Another bank of high-resolution cameras capture signs such as speed limits and street names.&lt;ref name="cnet camera 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-57550673-48/nokia-navteq-show-us-how-a-map-is-made|title=Nokia, Navteq show us how a map is made|last=Goodwin|first=Antuan|date=15 November 2012|publisher=CNET|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, Nokia acquired Berkeley based company Earthmine to further bolster its 3D street level imagery processing capabilities.&lt;ref name="Nokia earth mine 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lumiaconversations.microsoft.com/2012/11/13/innovating-modern-map-making-with-earthmine/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119202956/http://lumiaconversations.microsoft.com/2012/11/13/innovating-modern-map-making-with-earthmine/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 January 2015|title=Innovating modern map making with Earthmine|last=Bonetti|first=Pino|date=13 November 2012|publisher=[[Microsoft Mobile]]|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, HERE relies on local source data and input from map users to generate constant daily map updates, such as real time traffic, turn by turn directions, public transportation routes and information about local business and attractions.

By 2013, four out of five cars globally with fully integrated in-dash navigation systems used Here data. HERE supplies map content for Alpine, BMW, Mercedes, Garmin, Hyundai, Pioneer, Volkswagen and Toyota among other car companies and enterprises.&lt;ref name="TC car data 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/31/nokia-here-toyota|title=Nokia Chalks Up In-Car Maps Win Against Google, Signs Toyota Motor Europe To Use HERE Local Search|last=Lomas|first=Natasha|date=31 January 2013|publisher=[[Techcrunch]]|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HERE also provides mapping data for popular apps to find and order taxis. Some of these apps are Easy Taxi, MetroView and Grab Taxi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.here.com/2014/09/25/easy-taxi-grab-taxi-metroview-use-find-taxi/|title=Easy Taxi, MetroView and Grab Taxi use HERE to find you a taxi|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform partnerships==
HERE licenses its location platform to other major companies including Amazon, Bing, Yahoo!, Flickr, SAP and Oracle. Each partner uses the HERE location platform, which is available to any business or screen, to optimise experiences for its own users depending on the particular context. Amazon, for example, uses the HERE platform for maps and geocoding, in Amazon Maps.

Nokia threatened legal action against a small [[UK]] technology firm over its use of the word "Here". Lowdownapp, a digital personal assistant allows users to tell friends they have arrived at a location by pressing the "Here" button. In a letter seen by the [[BBC]], Nokia gave London-based Lowdownapp a deadline of 10 February 2015, to rebrand the "Here" function of the apps. "Our client has invested heavily in building and promoting the Here brand since launch,". The firm said it had registered trademarks for the word when it related to computer software, such as apps. David Senior, chief executive of Lowdownapp, described the threat as a real-life [[Goliath|David versus Goliath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dave Lee |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31059897|title=Nokia threatens London start-up over 'HERE'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=30 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:MX''' is the entry for [[Mexico]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Mexico, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[states of Mexico|1 federal district and 31 states]]. The capital of the country [[Mexico City]] forms the Mexican Federal District and has special status equal to the states.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|MX}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Mexico. The second part is three letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

Subdivision names are sorted in traditional [[Spanish alphabet]]ical order: a-c, ch, d-l, ll, m-n, ñ, o-z.

'''James Archibald Houston''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], [[FRSA]] (June 12, 1921 – April 17, 2005) was a Canadian artist, designer, children's author and filmmaker who played an important role in the recognition of [[Inuit art]] and introduced printmaking to the Inuit. The Inuit named him "Saumik," which means "the left-handed one".

==Biography==
Born in [[St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]], he studied art as a child with [[Arthur Lismer]] and was educated at the [[Ontario College of Art]] (1938–40), [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] in [[Paris]] (1947–48) and in Japan (1958–59) where he studied printmaking. He fought in [[World War II]] with the [[Toronto Scottish Regiment]], receiving the [[Canadian Volunteer Service Medal]]. After the war, he went to the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Eastern Arctic]] to paint and lived there for twelve years. He was a northern service officer and civil administrator of western [[Baffin Island]]. In 1962, he moved to New York and became associate director of design with [[Steuben Glass]].

Moving effortlessly and with great success between different activities, perhaps his biggest accomplishment was his work in the Eastern Arctic of Canada, developing Inuit art. In 1948, Houston traveled to a small Inuit community in Arctic Quebec, [[Inukjuak, Quebec|Inukjuak]] (then [[Port Harrison]]), to draw and paint images of the Inuit and the Arctic landscape.  He traded his own drawings, done on the spot, for a small carving, by an Inuit hunter named Nayoumealuk,&lt;ref name="nunatsiaq"&gt;{{Citation | first = Jane | last = George | url =  http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/nunavut990329/nvt90305_10.html | title = The beginnings of commercial carving on display in Ottawa | newspaper = [[Nunatsiaq News]] | date = 5 March 1999 | accessdate = 8 January 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of a seated deer. Houston recognized its aesthetic appeal and returned to the [[Canadian Handicrafts Guild]], in [[Montreal]], with roughly a dozen small carvings, done mostly in [[steatite]]. The guild, which had tried as early as the 1920s to foster an Inuit-handicrafts market, was impressed with the carving; they were equally impressed by Houston. The guild secured a [[Government of Canada|federal government]] grant of $1,100 and sent Houston back north in the summer of 1949 to make bulk purchases in various communities in the Eastern Arctic.

When Houston returned to Montreal that fall, the guild mounted their first exhibition of [[Inuit]] carvings. According to collector Ian Lindsay, the first exhibition was a complete sell-out. The government put more resources into developing an art and handicrafts market in the Arctic, hiring Houston to live in [[Cape Dorset]] as the first "roving crafts officer", and tapping him to write promotional material for sales in the south. The guild's fall sales exhibitions became annual affairs, with lineups routinely stretching out the door and down the block on Peel Street. By the late 1950s, the Government had sponsored tours of Inuit art through Eastern and Western Europe, South America and the Middle East. After successfully launching Inuit sculpture, Houston introduced printmaking in 1957, which met with the same success.

Houston lived in Cape Dorset with his wife Alma Houston and his two sons, Samuel and John Houston until 1962, when the couple split and he moved to New York City. He was writer and producer of the 1974 film based on his novel, ''[[The White Dawn]]''. In 1976, his 70-foot high acrylic and aluminum sculpture "Aurora Borealis" was installed in Calgary's new Glenbow Museum, where it is still on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stott|first1=Jon C.|title=James Archibald Houston|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/james-archibald-houston|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Connecticut]], aged 83.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3911">'''John Phokas''' (or '''Phocas''') was a 12th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] pilgrim to the [[Holy Land]]. He wrote an account of his travels, the so-called ''Ekphrasis'' (or ''Concise Description'') ''of the Holy Places'', "the most elegant of Palestinian pilgrimage accounts".&lt;ref name=Angold&gt;[[Michael Angold]] (2016), "The Fall of Jerusalem (1187) as Viewed from Byzantium," in Adrian J. Boas (ed.), ''The Crusader World'' (London &amp; New York: Routledge) pp. 289–308, at 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Doubt has recently arisen over whether Phokas was in fact the author of the ''Ekphrasis'', which has been re-attributed instead to [[John Doukas Kamateros]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Charis Messis (2011), "[https://www.academia.edu/1574055/Litt%C3%A9rature_voyage_et_politique_au_XII_si%C3%A8cle_L_Ekphrasis_des_lieux_saints_de_Jean_Phokas Littérature, voyage et politique au XII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle: L&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Ekphrasis des lieux saints'' de Jean 'Phokas']," ''Byzantinoslavica'' '''69''' (3), pp. 146–66, this work has been misattributed to Phokas. Its real author was John Doukas, who went on an imperial mission to the Holy Land in 1177. See Shay Eshel, ''The Concept of the Elect Nation in Byzantium'' (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little biographical information about Phokas is available. One manuscript of the ''Ekphrasis'' contains a note stating that he was a priest and that his father, a certain Matthew, became a monk on [[Patmos]]. According to this marginal note, his trip to the Holy Land took place in either 1177 or 1195. He is known to have accompanied Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]] (reigned 1143–80) on an expedition to the sea off Attaleia (now [[Antalya]]). He may be the same person as the Focas who, according to the ''[[Annales Herbipolenses]]'', was sent by Manuel in 1147 to guide the crusading army of King [[Conrad III of Germany]] from [[Nicaea]] to [[Iconium]].&lt;ref name=Kazhdan&gt;{{ODB|article=Phokas, John|first=Alexander|last=Kazhdan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phokas's ''Ekphrasis'' is both concise and precise. He had a rather positive attitude towards the [[Crusaders]]. In some cases he provides unique information. He describes a fanatical [[Saracen]] sect called the ''Chasisioi'' (perhaps the [[Assassins]]).&lt;ref name=Kazhdan/&gt; He calls the [[river Jordan]] "the holiest among rivers" and names three monasteries in the vicinity of site of the [[baptism of Jesus]] dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Our Lady of Kalamon]], [[John Chrysostom]] and [[John the Baptist]]. The latter was rebuilt, he says, by Manuel I.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB|article=Jordan|first1=Gary|last1=Vikan|first2=Anthony|last2=Cutler}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also reports that [[Cana]] was nothing more than a ''kastellion'' (a small fortified settlement),&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB|article=Cana|first1=Gary|last1=Vikan|first2=Zvi 'Uri|last2=Ma'oz}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there were two monasteries (one Greek, one Latin) atop [[Mount Tabor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB|article=Tabor, Mount|first1=Gary|last1=Vikan|first2=Alexander|last2=Kazhdan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the site of ancient [[Jericho]] was covered in gardens and vineyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB|article=Jericho|first1=Gary|last1=Vikan|first2=Zvi 'Uri|last2=Ma'oz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the [[Bible]], Phokas also quotes from such ancient authors as [[Josephus Flavius]] and [[Achilles Tatius]].&lt;ref name=Kazhdan/&gt; The ''Ekphrasis'' may have been written against the pilgrimage account of [[Constantine Manasses]], who returned from the Holy Land disillusioned and wondering why Christ lived there. In the ''Ekphrasis'', the beauty of the places is stressed repeatedly.&lt;ref name=Angold/&gt;

The '''Kalambo Falls''' on the [[Kalambo River]] is a {{convert|772|ft|m|adj=on}} single-drop [[waterfall]] on the border of [[Zambia]] and [[Tanzania]] at the southeast end of [[Lake Tanganyika]]. The falls are some of the tallest uninterrupted falls in [[Africa]] (after South Africa's [[Tugela Falls]], Ethiopia's Jin Bahir Falls and others). Downstream of the falls is the Kalambo Gorge, which has a width of about 1&amp;nbsp;km and a depth of up to 300&amp;nbsp;m, running for about 5&amp;nbsp;km before opening out into the Lake Tanganyika [[rift valley]].

The falls were first seen by non-Africans in approximately 1913. The expedition which mapped the falls and the area around it was in 1928 and lead by [[Enid Gordon-Gallien]].&lt;ref name="Gordon-Gallien 1929 p=28"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gordon-Gallien | first=Enid | title=The Kalambo River and Falls | journal=The Geographical Journal | publisher=JSTOR | volume=74 | issue=1 | year=1929 | issn=0016-7398 | doi=10.2307/1784940 | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was assumed that the height of falls exceeded 300&amp;nbsp;m, but measurements in the 1920s gave a more modest result, above 200&amp;nbsp;m. Later measurements, in 1956, gave a result of 221&amp;nbsp;m. After this several more measurements have been made, each with slightly different results. The width of the falls is 3.6–18&amp;nbsp;m.

Kalambo Falls is also considered one of the most important archaeological sites in Africa, with occupation spanning over 250,000 years.

==Archaeology==
Archaeologically, Kalambo Falls is one of the most important sites in Africa. It has produced a sequence of past human activity stretching over more than two hundred and fifty thousand years, with evidence of continuous habitation since the Late [[Early Stone Age]] until modern times. It was first excavated in 1953 by [[John Desmond Clark|John Desmond (J.D.) Clark]] who recognized archaeological activity around a small basin lake upstream of the falls. Excavations in 1953, 1956, 1959, and 1963 allowed Clark to make conclusions about the multiple different cultures inhabiting the area over thousands of years of time.

== Pleistocene environmental reconstruction ==
J.D. Clark's work incorporated both questions of the cultures who lived at the Kalambo Falls site as well as what their environment was like during times of occupation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kalambo Falls Prehistoric Site Volume 1|last=Clark|first=J.D.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using plant (floral) and [[pollen analyses]], Clark was able to conduct the process of [http://archaeology.about.com/od/pterms/g/paleoenviro.htm paleoenvironmental reconstruction].  By studying pollen that settled on the earth during different environmental settings, Clark was able to form a general idea of what ecological factors affected the Kalambo Falls region at different times. In order to do this, Clark used a tool for drawing out [[Core sample|sediment cores]] in order to observe and analyse the different layers below the surface of the earth today. He separated these layers into 6 different spectra, labeled zones U through Z.  The [[law of superposition]] is important to note when discussing sedimentary layers; this law states that more recent layers of soil dispersal will overlie older ones.

'''Zone U'''  The bottom of Clark's core sample is the oldest layer. Pollen samples collected indicate that swamp vegetation and an abundance of grass grew on the Kalambo River. The tests also indicated that the surrounding woodland grew during dry and hot climates. Clark concludes that the ground-water levels must have been high in order for a swamp and fringing, or [[riparian forest]], to grow along the waters edge during a period of reduced rainfall.

'''Zone V'''  Pollen collected from the next zone indicate an identical environment with the swamp and woodland vegetation that was not affected by climate conditions, such as the drop of 3° [[Celsius]] (C) in the area.

'''Zone W'''  Pollen of plants that grow in more open areas with more rainfall were taken from Zone W. This indicates an increase in rainfall to about 75–100&amp;nbsp;cm and a woodland with an open canopy to allow that rainfall to reach the ground below.

'''Zone X'''  Clark indicates that the study of this zone was only on one sample drawn from the soil below, so the conclusions are not finite in his study.  Plants indicated show a fringing forest that was poorly developed with a very open woodland. Within these woodland conditions, there seems to be an influence of evergreen elements that emerged.

'''Zone Y'''  Clark was able to date this zone to approximately 27,000 to 30,000 years ago, because conditions were comparable to those dated in European soils from this time. Evidence of an increase in rainfall and a temperature drop of 4.1&amp;nbsp;°C with a fringing forest that was well developed with the return of swamp plants is indicated in the pollen collected.

'''Zone Z'''  The final zone indicates a much poorer fringing forest and a reduced shift of vegetation growth at the time.

== Culture history of the site ==

=== Early Stone Age ===
The [[Early Stone Age]] is described by Barham and Mitchell as the time period where the ancient ancestors of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' first emerged, branching from the ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', evolving into ''[[Homo habilis]]'' and then ''[[Homo erectus]]''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Africans: African Archaeology From The Earliest Toolmakers to Most Recent Foragers|last=Barham|first=Lawrence and Peter Mitchell|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-521-61265-4|location=|pages=16|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.6 million years ago to 280,000 years ago''.''  Archaeologists hypothesize that the technological progression over time can be examined in the morphological characteristics of tools that are associated with different eras of habitation.  The earliest identified stone tools, made by ''Homo habilis'' are known as [[Oldowan]] tools, and they consist of the basic large pounding stones and small pebble flakes, known as Mode 1 technology.  As time progressed and ''Homo habilis'' evolved into ''Homo erectus,'' so did the technology as more specialized stone tools were being developed, even tools that were used for making other tools, Mode 2 and 3 technologies.

These Late [[Acheulian|Acheulean]] stone tools, along with hearths and well-preserved organic objects were found at Kalambo Falls and documented by JD Clark. These organic artifacts collected included a wooden club and [[digging stick]]s as well as the dietary evidence for fruit consumption. Tools excavated from Kalambo Gorge have been analyzed and OSL dating of quartzite within the soil context to between 500,000 and 50,000 years ago, with [[Amino-acid racemase|amino acid racemization]] dating the oldest artifacts to 100,000 years ago.

=== Middle Stone Age ===
The [[Middle Stone Age|Middle Stone age]], dated at 280,000 years ago to roughly 40,000 years ago,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[https://cashp.columbian.gwu.edu/sites/cashp.columbian.gwu.edu/files/downloads/ASBrooks_The%20Revolution%20that%20wasn't.pdf McBrearty, S and Brooks, A. 1999. "The Revolution that Wasn't: a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior"]&lt;/ref&gt; is the period where the final stages of hominid evolution brought what is known today as "[[Behavioral modernity|modern human behavior]]".

During this time, the Acheulean industry of Kalambo Falls was superseded by the [[Sangoan]] culture. This shift is considered by Clark as a result of an ecological shift to a cooler and wetter climate. It is at this time in the archaeological record that the large, Acheulean handaxe disappears and is replaced by the core axe and chopping tools characteristic of Sangoan technologies. Heavy woodworking tools and small, notched and denticulated tools, collected by Clark, were dated to have been made before 41,000&amp;nbsp;BC. This rapid change is predicted to be a result of population movement during this time period, as the "Acheulean man" who lived in open settlements were replaced by a culture associated with ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'' found at [[Broken Hill Africa|Broken Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, JD &amp; Van Zinderen Bakker, EM. 1964. ''Prehistoric Culture and Pleistocene Vegetation at Kalambo Falls, North Rhodesia''&lt;/ref&gt; the Sangoan culture.  Evidence of Sangoan habitation has been collected from less open Rock Shelters and Cave areas, possibly due to the persisting, wetter climate.

Evidence of fire technologies, such as hearths, charred logs, reddened clay, and stone heat spalls were also collected and found in association with charcoal remains. [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon dates]] of the scattered charcoal indicate people were using fire systematically there some 60,000 years ago.

The cool, wet climates of the region were similar to that of the Congo, and similar cultural practices have been identified at Kalambo Falls, known as [[Lupemban]] [[archaeological industry|industries]]. Evidence suggests that the Sangoan tradition was replaced by the Lupemban industry around 250,000 years ago and continued through to 117,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=African Archaeology. Third Edition|last=Phillipson|first=David W.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=117–120|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by two-sided, or [[Hand axe|bifacial]], stone tools like core axes and double-ended points that were possibly for hafting as spearheads. Geological studies by J.D. Clark indicate that the frequency of these tools is possibly due to factors that exemplified the amount of large pieces of breakable, or [[Knapping|knappable]], raw materials.

=== Later Stone Age ===
The [[Later Stone Age]] is the final age of the [[Paleolithic]] Era of Africa, and generally refers to more recent hunter/gatherer sites. Around 10,000 years ago Kalambo Falls was occupied by the [[Magosian]] culture which in turn gave way to [[Wilton culture|Wilton]] activity.

=== Iron Age and the Luangwa tradition ===
Around the fourth century AD, a more industrialized [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]-speaking people began to farm and occupy the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Af/Zambia/Northern/Kalambo.htm|title=Kalambo Falls|last=Pavils|first=Gatis|date=2011|website=Wondermondo.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Bantu-speaking people made ceramic vessels that have characteristics of East African pottery, which suggests a population movement from the [[Rift valley|Rift Valley]]. Burials from this period are characterized by [[J. Desmond Clark|Clark]] as shaft grave burials, which are similar to those of the earlier cultures of the [[East African Rift]] as opposed to the Kalambo region.

The [[Iron Age]] in Zambia is split into an earlier, regionally categorized period and a later period of materialistically differing traditions. Early assemblages of iron tools and pottery have been collected from the Kalambo Falls and are categorized as being from the Kalambo Group tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillipson|first=D.W.|year=1974|title=Iron Age History and Archaeology of Zambia|jstor=180367|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=15 |issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.1017/s0021853700013219}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Kalambo falls, Early Iron Age traditions are believed to have continued into the 11th century.

In 1971, Robert C. Soper studied different assemblages of Iron Age pottery in eastern and southern Africa and consolidated them into two major groups, known as [[Urewe]] and [[Kwale]] wares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Africa: Food, Metals, and Towns|last=Shaw|first=Thurston|last2=Sinclair|first2=Paul|last3=Andah|first3=Bassey|last4=Okpoko|first4=Alex|publisher=Routledge Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=London|pages=484–485|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He indicated that Kalambo and Mwabulambo pot traditions may also be included in these. David W. Phillipson used these conclusions to form a north to south chronology of artifacts and comprised many of the groups studied by Soper into one, Mwitu tradition. This tradition is exhibited by pots that range from the first millennium AD.

The Kalambo group was replaced by the [[Luangwa, Zambia|Luangwa]] tradition, whose pottery is similar to the Early Iron Age [[Chondwe Group]] of the Central [[Copperbelt|African Copperbelt]]. Luangwa Pottery is characteristic of necked pots and shallow bowls, with the most common comb-stamped decoration pressed in a horizontal pattern of delineated lines. There has yet to be found any evidence for an interface between this Luangwa tradition and the Early Iron Age tradition at Kalambo Falls, whereas sites at the [[Eastern Province, Zambia|Eastern Province]] of Zambia exhibit this interrelationship. Exact dates for this transition in the Kalambo area are inconclusive, but the tradition has continued through to the present.

==Chronology of the site==
Attempts to date artifacts from Kalambo Falls have resulted in inconsistent results, ranging from 110,000 years ago with [[racemization]] to 182,000 ±10,000 to 76,000 ±10,000 years ago with applied [[Uranium-thorium dating|uranium series dating]]. These studies underscore the difficulty in establishing a chronology for human habitation at the falls, which has led some archaeologists to disregard its significance in the [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] record.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=New investigations at Kalambo Falls, Zambia: Luminescence chronology, site formation, and archaeological significance|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2015|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Luminescence dating|optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) on quartz artifacts has recently improved understanding of the site's chronology. OSL works by sending signals through a crystalline material and collects data on how long ago the stone was exposed to light or heat.

OSL results have led to the creation of a new chronology for the site, broken into six stages. Stage 1 ranges between approximately 500,000 to 300,000 years ago. Stage 2 ranges from 300,000 to 50,000 years ago. Stage 3 dates range from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago. Stage 4 deposits date to 1,500 to 500 years ago and Stage 5 follows after 490 years ago.

Acheulean stone tools (Mode 2 and 3 technologies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) were collected from stratigraphic layers corresponding to the first and second stages. More complex Mode 3 tools came from the first three stages and are also found in Stage 4, whose corresponding layers contain a mix of [[Stone Age|Stone]] and [[African Iron Age|Iron Age]] artifacts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Zambia and UNESCO significance ==
In 1964, the archaeological site was gazetted as a national monument by Zambia's National Heritage Conservation Commission. It has since been protected under Zambia's 1989 National Heritage Conservation Act.

In 2009, Kalambo Falls was included on [[UNESCO]] list of tentative [[World Heritage Site]]s. Justifications for the inclusion are that the Kalambo Falls are the 2nd highest waterfalls in Africa, the evidence of one of the longest examples of human occupation in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], and the collected stone tools are from one of the world's earliest tool industries, the Acheulean.

As of today, Kalambo Falls remains on the tentative list for recognition as a protected World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5426/|title=Kalambo Falls - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary ecology==
Today, both human and animal populations traverse the Kalambo Falls area, which has a basin above the falls that attracts many of both populations as an important stopping place.  On the Zambian border, the area is now a game preserve for the protection of many animals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The falls' cliff-face ledges provide nesting places and breeding sites for a [[marabou stork]] colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zambia.travel/explore/kalambo-falls/|title=Kalambo Falls|last=|first=|date=2016|website=zambia.travel|publisher=Zambia Tourism Agency|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knossos silver coin 400bc.jpg|thumb|Silver coin from [[Knossos]] representing the Labyrinth, 400 BC.]]

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Labyrinth''' ({{lang-grc|Λαβύρινθος}} ''labúrinthos'') was an elaborate, confusing structure designed and built by the legendary artificer [[Daedalus]] for King [[Minos]] of [[Crete]] at [[Knossos]]. Its function was to hold the [[Minotaur]], the monster eventually killed by the [[hero]] [[Theseus]]. Daedalus had so cunningly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doob|1992|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although early Cretan coins occasionally exhibit branching (multicursal) patterns,&lt;ref&gt;Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', 2000, item 43, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; the single-path (unicursal) seven-course "Classical" design without branching or dead ends became associated with the Labyrinth on coins as early as 430 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', 2000, item 50, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and similar non-branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth – even though both logic and literary descriptions make it clear that the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth'', pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as the designs became more elaborate, visual depictions of the mythological Labyrinth from Roman times until the Renaissance are almost invariably unicursal.  Branching mazes were reintroduced only when [[hedge maze]]s became popular during the Renaissance.

In English, the term ''labyrinth'' is generally synonymous with ''[[maze]]''.  As a result of the long history of unicursal representation of the mythological Labyrinth, however, many contemporary scholars and enthusiasts observe a distinction between the two.  In this specialized usage ''maze'' refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction, while a unicursal ''labyrinth'' has only a single path to the center. A labyrinth in this sense has an unambiguous route to the center and back and presents no navigational challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The usage restricting ''maze'' to patterns that involve choices of path is mentioned by Matthews (p. 2–3) as early as 1922, though he does not find the distinction useful and does not follow it himself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labyrinthos.net/Labyrinth%20Typology.pdf |author=Jeff Saward |website=Labyrinthos |title=Mazes or Labyrinths? |access-date=28 Dec 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unicursal labyrinths appeared as designs on [[pottery]] or [[basketry]], as [[body art]], and in etchings on walls of caves or churches.  The Romans created many primarily decorative unicursal designs on walls and floors in tile or mosaic.  Many labyrinths set in floors or on the ground are large enough that the path can be walked. Unicursal patterns have been used historically both in group ritual and for private [[meditation]], and are increasingly found for therapeutic use in hospitals and hospices.

==Etymology==
''Labyrinth'' is a word of [[pre-Greek]] origin, which the Greeks associated with the palace of [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]], excavated by [[Arthur Evans]] early in the 20th century. The word appears in a [[Linear B]] inscription as da-pu-ri-to.&lt;ref name= dapurito &gt;''The Oxford classical dictionary''. Oxford University Press p.116.

II. Zur mykenischen Tracht und Kultur |periodical=Jahrbuch des Kaiserlich deutschen archäologischen Instituts |date=1892 |volume=VII| page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ''labyrinthos'' might derive from ''labrys'', a [[Lydian language|Lydian]] word for "double-bladed axe".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Λυδοὶ γάρ ‘λάβρυν’ τὸν πέλεκυν ὀνομάζουσι}}, Plutarch, ''[[Moralia|Greek Questions]]'', 45 2.302a.&lt;/ref&gt;  Evans suggested that the palace at Knossos was the original labyrinth, and since the double axe motif appears in the palace ruins,
he asserted that ''labyrinth'' could be understood to mean "the house of the double axe".&lt;ref name= dapurito/&gt; This designation may not have been limited to Knossos, since the same symbols were discovered in other palaces in [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |last=Rouse |first=W. H. D. |date=1901 |title=The Double Axe and the Labyrinth |journal=Journal of Hellenic Studies |volume=21 |issue= |pages=268–274}} Rouse criticised the association, noting the reappearance of the same inscribed symbols at the newly discovered palace at [[Phaistos]] (p. 273).&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Martin P. Nilsson| Nlsson]] observes that in [[Crete]] the "double axe" is not a weapon and always accompanies goddesses or women and not a male god. &lt;ref&gt; Nilsson Vol I, p. 277 &lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Robert S.P. Beekes| Beekes]] finds the relation with ''labrys'' speculative, and suggests instead the relation with ''lavra'' (λαύρα), narrow street.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S.P. Beekes]]. Greek Etymological dictionary, p.819 &lt;/ref&gt;  The original Minoan word appears to refer to labyrinthine underground grottoes, such as seen at [[Gortyn]].&lt;ref name="Sarullo"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this appears to have been the standard Classical understanding of the word. It is also possible that the word labyrinth is derived from the Egyptian ''loperohunt'', meaning palace or temple by the lake.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The Egyptian labyrinth near Lake Morris is described by Herodotus and Strabo. &lt;ref&gt; H.G.Wunderlich.

When the [[Bronze Age]] site at [[Knossos]] was excavated by explorer [[Arthur Evans]], the complexity of the architecture prompted him to suggest that the palace had been the Labyrinth of Daedalus.  Evans found various bull motifs, including an image of [[Bull-leaping|a man leaping over the horns of a bull]], as well as depictions of a [[labrys]] carved into the walls.

Hereon there danced youths and maidens whom all would woo, with their hands on one another's wrists. The maidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that were slightly oiled. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune."

where young men and women, of the age of those sent to Crete as prey for the Minotaur, would dance together. By extension, in popular legend the palace is associated with the myth of the Minotaur.

In the 2000s, archaeologists explored other potential sites of the labyrinth.&lt;ref name="skotinogortyn"&gt;{{cite web

Another contender is a series of underground tunnels at [[Gortyn]], accessed by a narrow crack but expanding into interlinking caverns. Unlike the Skotino cave, these caverns have smooth walls and columns, and appear to have been at least partially man-made. This site corresponds to an unusual labyrinth symbol on a 16th-century map of Crete contained in a book of maps in the library of [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. A map of the caves themselves was produced by the [[France|French]] in 1821. The site was also used by German soldiers to store ammunition during the [[Second World War]]. Howarth's investigation was shown on a documentary&lt;ref name="natgeodocumentary"&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/the-holy-grail-5048/Overview National Geographic Channel: The Holy Grail (and the Minotaur)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101072958/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/the-holy-grail-5048/Overview |date=1 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; produced for the [[National Geographic Channel]].

===Herodotus' Egyptian labyrinth===
More generally, ''labyrinth'' might be applied to any extremely complicated maze-like structure. [[Herodotus]], in Book II of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)#Book II (Euterpe)|Histories]]'', describes as a "labyrinth" a building complex in Egypt, "near the place called the [[Crocodilopolis|City of Crocodiles]]," that he considered to surpass the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]:
{{blockquote|It has twelve covered courts — six in a row facing north, six south — the gates of the one range exactly fronting the gates of the other. Inside, the building is of two storeys and contains three thousand rooms, of which half are underground, and the other half directly above them. I was taken through the rooms in the upper storey, so what I shall say of them is from my own observation, but the underground ones I can speak of only from report, because the Egyptians in charge refused to let me see them, as they contain the tombs of the kings who built the labyrinth, and also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles. The upper rooms, on the contrary, I did actually see, and it is hard to believe that they are the work of men; the baffling and intricate passages from room to room and from court to court were an endless wonder to me, as we passed from a courtyard into rooms, from rooms into galleries, from galleries into more rooms and thence into yet more courtyards. The roof of every chamber, courtyard, and gallery is, like the walls, of stone. The walls are covered with carved figures, and each court is exquisitely built of white marble and surrounded by a colonnade.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|The Histories]]'', translated by [[Aubrey de Sélincourt]], Book II, pp. 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 19th century, the remains of this structure were discovered by [[Flinders Petrie]] at the foot of the pyramid of [[Amenemhat III]] at [[Hawara]] in the [[Faiyum Oasis]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical accounts of various authors (Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, among others) are not entirely consistent, perhaps due to degradation of the structure during Classical times.&lt;ref&gt;Kern 2000, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  In origin, the structure was likely a collection of funerary temples such as are commonly found near Egyptian pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Kern 2000, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, the ''[[Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]]'' described the structure as "the largest of all the temples of Egypt, the so-called Labyrinth, of which, however, only the foundation stones have been preserved."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Thurston Peck|Peck, Harry Thurston (chief editor)]].  "Hieratic Papyrus. (Twentieth Dynasty.)" in the ''[[Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]]'', published 1898, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus' description of the Egyptian Labyrinth inspired some central scenes in [[Bolesław Prus]]' 1895 [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]''.

===Pliny's Lemnian labyrinth===
[[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'' (36.90) lists the legendary [[Smilis]], reputed to be a contemporary of Daedalus, together with the historical mid-sixth-century BC architects and sculptors Rhoikos and Theodoros as two of the makers of the Lemnian labyrinth, which Andrew Stewart&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stewart, ''One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works'', "Smilis."&lt;/ref&gt; regards as "evidently a misunderstanding of the Samian temple's location ''en limnais'' ['in the marsh']."

===Pliny's Italian labyrinth===
According to Pliny, the tomb of the great Etruscan general [[Lars Porsena]] contained an underground maze. Pliny's description of the exposed portion of the tomb is intractable; Pliny, it seems clear, had not observed this structure himself, but is quoting the historian and Roman antiquarian [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]].

===Ancient labyrinths outside Europe===
[[File:Halebid2.JPG|thumb|right|Carving showing the warrior Abhimanyu entering the ''chakravyuha'' – [[Hoysaleswara temple]], [[Halebidu]], India]]
A design essentially identical to the 7-course "classical" pattern appeared in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture, the [[Tohono O'odham people]] labyrinth which features [[I'itoi]], the "Man in the Maze." The Tonoho O'odham pattern has two distinct differences from the classical: it is radial in design, and the entrance is at the top, where traditional labyrinths have the entrance at the bottom (see below).  The earliest appearances cannot be dated securely; the oldest is commonly dated to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Saward |first=Jeff |date=2003 |title=Labyrinths and Mazes |publisher=Gaia |page=70 |isbn=1579905390 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prehistoric petroglyph on a riverbank in [[Goa]] shows the same pattern and has been dated to circa 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url = https://sites.google.com/site/isiscrete/rationale

| title= Festival on Labyrinth and Symmetry
| date = 9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples have been found among cave art in northern [[India]] and on a dolmen shrine in the [[Nilgiri Mountains]], but are difficult to date accurately. Early labyrinths in India typically follow the Classical pattern or a local variant of it; some have been described as plans of forts or cities.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, ''Labyrinths and Mazes'', p. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Labyrinths appear in Indian manuscripts and [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] texts from the 17th century onward. They are often called "[[Chakravyuha]]" in reference to an impregnable battle formation described in the ancient [[Mahabharata]] epic. Lanka, the capital city of mythic Rāvana, is described as a labyrinth in the 1910 translation of [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|Al-Beruni]]'s ''India'' (c. 1030 AD) p.&amp;nbsp;306 (with a diagram on the following page).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/pages/ldpd_5949073_001_00000362.html [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|Al-Beruni]], ''India'', (c.1030&amp;nbsp;AD), Edward C. Sachau (translator), Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co, London, 1910] Online version from Columbia University Libraries (Retrieved 5 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[White Sea]], notably on the [[Solovetsky Islands]], there have been preserved more than 30 stone labyrinths. The most remarkable monument is the [[Stone labyrinths of Bolshoi Zayatsky Island]] - a group of 13–14 stone labyrinths on 0.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area of one small island. These labyrinths are thought to be 2,000–3,000 years old.

==Labyrinth as pattern==
In antiquity, the less complicated labyrinth pattern familiar from medieval examples was already developed. In Roman [[floor mosaic]]s, the simple classical labyrinth is framed in the meander border pattern, squared off as the medium requires, but still recognisable. Often an image of the [[Minotaur]] appears in the center of these mosaic labyrinths. Roman meander patterns gradually developed in complexity towards the fourfold shape that is now familiarly known as the [[medieval]] form. The labyrinth retains its connection with death and a triumphant return: at [[Hadrumetum|Hadrumentum]] in [[North Africa]] (now [[Sousse]]), a Roman family tomb has a fourfold labyrinth mosaic floor with a dying minotaur in the center and a mosaic inscription: &lt;small&gt;HICINCLUSUS.VITAMPERDIT&lt;/small&gt; "Enclosed here, he loses life" (Kern 169; Kerényi fig.31).

==Medieval labyrinths and turf mazes==
[[File:Inneres der Kathedrale.jpg|thumb|mimi|right|[[Chartres Cathedral]], about 1750, Jean Baptiste Rigaud]]
When the early humanist [[Benzo d'Alessandria]] visited [[Verona]] before 1310, he noted the "''Laberinthum'' which is now called the [[Arena of Verona|Arena]]";&lt;ref&gt;"quod nunc Harena dicitur": Roberto Weiss, ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'' 1969:25.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps he was seeing the ''cubiculi'' beneath the arena's missing floor.
The full flowering of the medieval labyrinth came about from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries with the grand pavement labyrinths of the gothic [[cathedral]]s, notably [[Cathedral of Chartres|Chartres]], [[Reims Cathedral|Reims]] and [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]] in northern [[France]]. These labyrinths may have originated as symbolic allusion to the [[Jerusalem|Holy City]]; and some modern thinkers have theorized that prayers and devotions may have accompanied the perambulation of their intricate paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Labyrinth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some books (in particular guidebooks) suggest that the mazes on cathedral floors served as substitutes for pilgrimage paths, the earliest attested use of the phrase "chemin de Jerusalem" (path to Jerusalem) dates to the late 18th century when it was used to describe mazes at [[Reims]] and [[Saint-Omer]].&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; The accompanying ritual, supposedly involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying, may have been practiced at Chartres during the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; However, no contemporary evidence supports the idea that labyrinths had such a purpose for early Christians.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral labyrinths are thought to be the inspiration for the many [[turf maze]]s in the UK, such as survive at [[Wing, Rutland|Wing]], [[Hilton, Cambridgeshire|Hilton]], [[Alkborough Turf Maze|Alkborough]], and [[Saffron Walden]].

Over the same general period, some 500 or more non-ecclesiastical labyrinths were constructed in [[Scandinavia]]. These labyrinths, generally in coastal areas, are marked out with stones, most often in the simple 7- or 11-course classical forms. They often have names which translate as "[[Troy Town]]." They are thought to have been constructed by fishing communities:  trapping malevolent [[troll]]s or winds in the labyrinth's coils might ensure a safe fishing expedition. There are also stone labyrinths on the [[Isles of Scilly]], although none is known to date from before the nineteenth century.

There are examples of labyrinths in many disparate cultures. The symbol has appeared in various forms and media ([[petroglyph]]s, classic-form, medieval-form, pavement, turf, and basketry) at some time throughout most parts of the world, from Native [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] to [[Australia]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[India]], and [[Nepal]].

==Modern labyrinths==
{{original research|section|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Labyrinth.JPG|thumb|left|Labyrinth on floor of [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco]].]]
In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in labyrinths and a revival in labyrinth building, of both unicursal and multicursal patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Saward |first=Jeff |date=2003 |title=Labyrinths and Mazes |publisher=Gaia |chapter=Chapter 6: The Modern Revival |pages=179–208 |isbn=1579905390 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern imagery, the labyrinth of Daedalus is often represented by a multicursal maze, in which one may become lost.

The Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] was entranced with the idea of the labyrinth, and used it extensively in his short stories (such as "The House of Asterion" in ''The Aleph'').  His use of it has inspired other authors (e.g. [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', Mark Z. Danielewski's ''[[House of Leaves]]''). Additionally, [[Roger Zelazny]]'s fantasy series, ''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]'', features a labyrinth, called "the Pattern," which grants those who walk it the power to move between parallel worlds. The avant-garde multi-screen film, ''[[In the Labyrinth (film)|In the Labyrinth]]'', presents a search for meaning in a symbolic modern labyrinth. In [[Rick Riordan]]'s series [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]], the events of the fourth novel ''[[The Battle of the Labyrinth]]'' predominantly take place within the labyrinth of Daedalus, which has followed [[History of Western civilization|the heart of the West]] to settle beneath the [[United States]]. Australian author [[Sara Douglass]] incorporated some labyrinthine ideas in her series [[The Troy Game]], in which the Labyrinth on Crete is one of several in the ancient world, created with the cities as a source of magical power. [[Lawrence Durrell]]'s ''The Dark Labyrinth'' depicts travelers trapped underground in Crete. A magical labyrinth, based on the original myth, appears in the third episode of ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]'' ("And The Horns of a Dilemma").

The labyrinth is also treated in contemporary [[fine arts]]. Examples include [[Piet Mondrian]]'s ''Dam and Ocean'' (1915), [[Joan Miró]]'s ''Labyrinth'' (1923), [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''Minotauromachia'' (1935), [[M. C. Escher]]'s ''[[Relativity (M. C. Escher)|Relativity]]'' (1953), [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]]'s ''Labyrinth'' (1957), [[Jean Dubuffet]]'s ''Logological Cabinet'' (1970), [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]]'s ''[[Connemara]] sculpture'' (1971), [[Joe Tilson]]'s ''Earth Maze'' (1975), [[Richard Fleischner]]'s ''Chain Link Maze'' (1978), [[István Orosz]]'s ''Atlantis Anamorphosis'' (2000), [[Dmitry Rakov]]'s ''Labyrinth'' (2003), and drawings by contemporary American artist Mo Morales employing what the artist calls "Labyrinthine projection." The Italian painter Davide Tonato has dedicated many of his artistic works to the labyrinth theme.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Tonato, ''Labyrinth of Transformations'' (edited by Renzo Margonari), Grafiche Aurora, Verona 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Wallinger]] has created a set of 270 [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] plaques of unicursal labyrinth designs, one for every tube station in the [[London Underground]], to mark the 150th anniversary of the Underground.  The plaques were installed over a 16-month period in 2013 and 2014, and each is numbered according to its position in the route taken by the contestants in the 2009 [[Guinness World Record]] [[Tube Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Labyrinths and mazes have been embraced by the [[video game]] industry, and countless video games include such a feature.

=== Cultural meanings ===
[[Prehistoric]] labyrinths may have served as traps for malevolent spirits or as paths for ritual dances.{{cn|date=September 2013}} Many Roman and Christian labyrinths appear at the entrances of buildings, suggesting that they may have served a similar [[wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Mellinkoff, ''Averting Demons'', 2004, Vol. 2, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In their cross-cultural study of signs and symbols, ''Patterns that Connect'', [[Carl Schuster]] and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]] present various forms of the labyrinth and suggest various possible meanings, including not only a sacred path to the home of a sacred ancestor, but also, perhaps, a representation of the ancestor him/herself: ."..many [New World] Indians who make the labyrinth regard it as a sacred symbol, a beneficial ancestor, a deity. In this they may be preserving its original meaning: the ultimate ancestor, here evoked by two continuous lines joining its twelve primary joints."&lt;ref name="Schuster 1996 307"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Schuster|first=Carl, &amp; Edmund Carpenter|title=Patterns that Connect: Social Symbolism in Ancient &amp; Tribal Art|year=1996|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|isbn=978-0-8109-6326-9|page=307}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Schuster also observes the common theme of the labyrinth being a refuge for a trickster; in India, the demon [[Ravana]] has dominion over labyrinths, the trickster Djonaha lives in a labyrinth according to Sumatran [[Batak|Bataks]], and Europeans say it is the home of a rogue.&lt;ref name="Schuster 1996 307"/&gt;

One can think of labyrinths as symbolic of [[pilgrimage]]; people can walk the path, ascending toward salvation or enlightenment. Author [[Ben Radford]] conducted an investigation into some of the claims of spiritual and healing effects of labyrinths, reporting on his findings in his book [[Mysterious New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Mysterious New Mexico|date=2014|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque, NM|isbn=978-0-8263-5450-1|pages=207–224|chapter=Chapter 10 Labyrinths: Sacred Symbols in the Sand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many labyrinths have been constructed recently in churches, hospitals, and parks. These are often used for contemplation; walking among the turnings, one loses track of direction and of the outside world, and thus quiets the mind. The Labyrinth Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwll.veriditas.labyrinthsociety.org/ Labyrinth.Society.org]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a locator for modern labyrinths all over the world.

In addition, the labyrinth can serve as a metaphor for situations that are difficult to be extricated from, as an image that suggests getting lost in a subterranean dungeon-like world. [[Octavio Paz]] titled his book on [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[National identity|identity]] ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'', describing the Mexican condition as orphaned and lost.

===Christian use===
[[File:Labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral.JPG|thumb|300px|Walking the labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral]]

Labyrinths have on various occasions been used in Christian tradition as a part of worship. The earliest known example is from a fourth-century pavement at the Basilica of St Reparatus, at Orleansville, Algeria, with the words "Sancta Eclesia" {{sic}} at the center, though it is unclear how it might have been used in worship.

In medieval times, labyrinths began to appear on church walls and floors around 1000 C.E.. The most famous medieval labyrinth, with great influence on later practice, was created in [[Chartres Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="kern_church"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying ritual, depicted in Romantic illustrations as involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying, may have been practiced at Chartres during the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

The use of labyrinths has recently been revived in some contexts of Christian worship. Many churches in Europe and North America have constructed permanent, typically unicursal, labyrinths, or employ temporary ones (e.g., painted on canvas or outlined with candles).  For example, a labyrinth was set up on the floor of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] for a week in March 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tarrant and Sally Dakin, ''Labyrinths and Prayer Stations'', p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservative Christians disapprove of labyrinths, considering them pagan practices or "new age" fads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=3440 |title=Maze Craze |author=Mark Tooley |work=Touchstone Magazine |publisher=The Fellowship of St. James |date=September 2000 |accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landscape connectivity''' in [[ecology]] is, broadly, "''the degree to which the [[landscape]] facilitates or impedes movement among [[Natural resource|resource]] patches''".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.D., Fahrig, L., Henein, K. and Merriam, G. 1993. Connectivity is a vital element of landscape structure. Oikos 68:571–573.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, connectivity may be a continuous property of the landscape and independent of patches and paths.&lt;ref name="Fischer, J. 2004"&gt;Fischer, J., Lindenmayer, D.B. and I. Fazey. 2004. Appreciating ecological complexity: habitat contours as a conceptual landscape model. Conservation Biology, 18: 1245–1253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer, J 2006"&gt;Fischer, J. and D.B. Lindenmayer. 2006. Beyond fragmentation: the continuum model for fauna research and conservation in human-modified landscapes. Oikos, 112: 473–480.&lt;/ref&gt; Connectivity includes both structural connectivity (the physical arrangements of disturbance and/or patches) and functional connectivity (the movement of individuals across contours of disturbance and/or among patches).&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, C. P. 2003. A scalar analysis of landscape connectivity. Oikos 102:433-439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baguette, M., S. Blanchet, D. Legrand, V. M. Stevens, and C. Turlure. 2013. Individual dispersal, landscape connectivity and ecological networks. Biological Reviews Of The Cambridge Philosophical Society 88:310–326.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which a landscape is connected determines the amount of [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] there is among patches, which influences [[gene flow]], local [[adaptation]], [[extinction]] risk, [[colonization]] [[probability]], and the potential for organisms to move as they cope with [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, J.A., C.D. Thomas, B.A. Wintle, and A. Moilanen. 2009. Climate change, connectivity and conservation decision-making: back to basics. Journal of Applied Ecology, 46: 964-969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McRae, B. H., Hall, S. A., Beier, P., Theobald, D. M. 2012. Where to Restore Ecological Connectivity? Detecting Barriers and Quantifying Restoration Benefits. PLoS ONE 7:e52604.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The concept of “Landscape connectivity” was first introduced by Dr. Gray Merriam in 1984. Merriam noted that movement among habitat patches was not merely a function of an organism’s attributes, but also, a quality of the landscape elements through which it must move.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tischendorf, L. and Fahrig, L. (2000). On the usage and measurement of landscape connectivity. ''Oikos. Vol.'' 90, Pg 7-19.&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasize this fundamental interaction in determining a particular movement pathway, Merriam (1984), defined landscape connectivity as “the degree to which absolute isolation is prevented by landscape elements which allow organisms to move among habitat patches.” &lt;ref&gt;Merriam, G. (1984). Connectivity: a fundamental ecological characteristic of landscape pattern. In: Brandt, J. and Agger, P. (eds), Proceedings of the 1st international seminar on methodology in landscape ecological research and planning. Roskilde University. Denmark, Pg 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years later, Merriam and colleagues, revised the definition to “the degree to which the landscape impedes or facilitates movement among resource patches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Taylor, P. D., Fahrig, L., Henein, K. and Merriam, G. (1993). Connectivity is a vital element of landscape structure. ''Oikos. Vol.'' 68, Pg 571-572.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition has undoubtedly become the most accepted and cited meaning within the scientific literature, many authors have continued to create their own definitions. With et al (1997), presented their interpretation as “the functional relationship among habitat patches, owing to the spatial contagion of habitat and the movement responses of organisms to landscape structure.”,&lt;ref&gt;With, K., Gardner, R., Turner, M. (1997). Landscape Connectivity and Population Distributions in Heterogeneous Environments. ''Oikos. Vol''. 78, Pg 151-169&lt;/ref&gt; and Ament et al. (2014) defined it as “the degree to which regional landscapes, encompassing a variety of natural, semi-natural, and developed [[land cover]] types, are conducive to wildlife movement and to sustain ecological processes.” &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ament, R., R. Callahan, M. McClure, M. Reuling, and G. Tabor. (2014). Wildlife Connectivity: Fundamentals for conservation action. Center for Large Landscape Conservation: Bozeman, Montana&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although there have been many definitions of landscape connectivity over the past 30 years, each new description emphasizes both a structural and a behavioural element to the landscape connectivity concept. The physical component is defined by the spatial and temporal configuration of the landscape elements ([[landform]], landcover and [[land use]] types), and the behavioural component is defined by the behavioural responses, of organisms and/or processes, to the physical arrangement of the landscape elements,&lt;ref&gt;Crooks KR, Sanjayan M. (2006) Connectivity Conservation. New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, A.F. (1998, 2003). Linkages in the Landscape: The Role of Corridors and Connectivity in Wildlife Conservation. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK&lt;/ref&gt;,.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Importance==
Habitat loss and [[habitat fragmentation]] have become ubiquitous in both natural and human modified landscapes, resulting in detrimental consequences for local [[species]] interactions and global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahrig, L. (2003). Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Biodiversity. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics. Vol. 34:487-515

&lt;/ref&gt; Human development now modifies over 50% of the earth’s landscape, leaving only patches of isolated natural or semi-natural habitats for the millions of other species we share this planet with.&lt;ref&gt;Barnosky et al. (2012). Nature 486, 52–58&lt;/ref&gt; Patterns of biodiversity and [[ecosystem function]]s are changing worldwide resulting in a loss of connectivity and [[ecological integrity]] for the entire global [[ecological network]].&lt;ref&gt;Foley et al. (2005). Science 309, 570–574&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of connectivity can influence individuals, [[Population dynamics|populations]] and communities through within species, between species, and between ecosystem interactions. These interactions affect ecological mechanisms such as nutrient and energy flows, predator-prey relationships, [[pollination]], [[seed dispersal]], demographic rescue, [[inbreeding avoidance]], colonization of unoccupied habitat, altered species interactions, and spread of disease,&lt;ref&gt;Rudnick DA, et al. The role of landscape connectivity in planning and implementing conservation and restoration priorities. Issues Ecol. 2012;16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanski I. Metapopulation dynamics. Nature. 1998;396(6706):41–9.&lt;/ref&gt; ,.&lt;ref&gt;Ayram, C., Mendoza, M., Etter, A., Salicrup, D.  (2016). Habitat connectivity in biodiversity conservation: A review of recent studies and applications. Progress in Physical Geography. Vol. 40 (1) Pg 7–37&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, landscape connectivity facilitates the movement of biotic processes such as animal movement, plant propagation, and genetic exchange, as well as abiotic processes such as water, energy, and material movement within and between ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Types of animal movement==

===Daily movements===
Within their [[home range]] or [[Territory (animal)|territory]] most animals must move daily among multiple primary habitat patches to forage for food and obtain all the resources they need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Migration===
Some species travel to different locations throughout the year to access the resources they need. These movements are usually predictable and are due to changes in the environmental conditions at the primary habitat site, or to facilitate access to [[breeding grounds]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Animal migration|Migratory]] behaviour is seen in land animals,&lt;ref&gt;Dingle, H. (1996). Migration: The biology of life on the move. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; birds &lt;ref&gt;Somveille M, Manica A, Butchart SHM, Rodrigues ASL (2013) Mapping Global Diversity Patterns for Migratory Birds. PLoS ONE 8(8):&lt;/ref&gt; and marine species,&lt;ref&gt;Luschi, P. (2013). Long-Distance Animal Migrations in the Oceanic Environment: Orientation and Navigation Correlates. ISRN Zoology, vol. 2013

&lt;/ref&gt; and the routes they follow are usually the same year after year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Dispersal===
Is the once in a lifetime movement of certain individuals from one population to another for the purpose of breeding.&lt;ref&gt;Traill, L., Brook, B., Frankham, R., and Bradshaw, C. (2010). Pragmatic population viability targets in a rapidly changing world. Biological Conservation. Vol. 143, (1) Pg 28–34&lt;/ref&gt; These exchanges maintain genetic and demographic diversity among populations.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, O. H. and M. E. Soule 1981. Conservation and Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disturbance movement===
Is the unpredictable movement of individuals or populations to new locations of suitable habitat due to an environmental disturbance. Major disturbances such as fire, natural disasters, human development, and climate change can impact the quality and distribution of habitats and necessitate the movement of species to new locations of suitable habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Incidental movement===
Movement of species in areas that are typically used by humans. These include [[Green belt|greenbelts]], recreational trail systems, [[hedgerows]], and [[golf course]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Connectivity conservation===
Preserving or creating landscape connectivity has become increasingly recognized as a key strategy to protect biodiversity, maintain viable ecosystems and wildlife populations, and facilitate the movement and adaptation of wildlife populations in the face of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Meiklejohn, K., R. Ament, and G. Tabor. (2010). Habitat corridors &amp; landscape connectivity: clarifying the terminology. Center for Large Landscape Conservation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which landscapes are connected determines the overall amount of movement taking place within and between local populations. This connectivity has influences on [[gene flow]], local [[adaptation]], extinction risk, colonization probability, and the potential for organisms to move and adapt to climate change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With habitat loss and fragmentation increasingly deteriorating natural habitats, the sizes and isolation of the remaining habitat fragments are particularly critical to the long-term [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of biodiversity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, connectivity among these remaining fragments, as well as the characteristics of the surrounding matrix, and the permeability and structure of the habitat edges are all important for biodiversity conservation and affect the overall persistence, strength and integrity of the remaining [[Biological interaction|ecological interactions]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortuna, M., Bascompte, J. (2006). Habitat loss and the structure of plant–animal mutualistic networks. Ecology Letters, (2006) 9: 281–286&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantifying landscape connectivity===
Since the definition of landscape connectivity has both a physical and a behavioural component, quantifying landscape connectivity is consequently organism-, process- and landscape-specific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to (Wiens &amp; Milne, 1989), the first step in the quantification process of landscape connectivity is defining the specific habitat or habitat network of the focal species, and in turn, describe the landscape elements from its point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J. A. and Milne, B. T. 1989. Scaling of ‘landscapes’ in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from a beetle’s perspective. – Landscape Ecol. 3: 87–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The next step is to determine the scale of the landscape structure as perceived by the [[organism]]. This is defined as the scale at which the species responds to the array of landscape elements, through its fine-scale (grain), and large-scale (extent), movement behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J. A. 1997. Metapopulation dynamics and landscape ecology. – In: Hanski, I. and Gilpin, M. E. (eds), Metapopulation biology. Academic Press, pp. 43–62&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, how the species responds to the different elements of a landscape is determined. This comprises the species’ movement pattern based on behavioural reactions to the mortality risk of the landscape elements, including habitat barriers and edges.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Connectivity metrics===

Although connectivity is an intuitive concept, there is no single consistently-used metric of connectivity. Theories of connectivity include consideration of both binary representations of connectivity through "corridors" and "linkages" and continuous representations of connectivity, which include the binary condition as a sub-set &lt;ref name="Fischer, J. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer, J 2006"/&gt;

Generally, connectivity metrics fall into three categories:&lt;ref&gt;Calabrese, J. M., and W. F. Fagan. 2004. A comparison-shopper's guide to connectivity metrics. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 2:529-536.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Structural connectivity metrics are based on the physical properties of landscapes, which includes the idea of patches (size, number of patches, average distance to each other) and relative disturbance (human structures such as roads, parcelization, urban/agricultural land-use, human population).
# Potential connectivity metrics are based on the landscape structure as well as some basic information about the study organism's [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] ability such as average dispersal distance, or dispersal kernel.
# Actual (also called realized, or functional) connectivity metrics are measured based on the actual movements of individuals along and across contours of connectivity, including among patches (where these exist). This takes into account the actual number of individuals born at different sites, their reproduction rates, and mortality during dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J. R., S. Mitarai, D. A. Siegel, J. E. Caselle, C. Dong, and J. C. McWilliams. 2010. Realized and potential larval connectivity in the Southern California Bight. Marine Ecology Progress Series 401:31-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors make a further distinction based on the number of individuals that not only disperse between sites, but that also survive to reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;Pineda, J., J. A. Hare, and S. Sponaungle. 2007. Larval transport and dispersal in the coastal ocean and consequences for population connectivity. Oceanography 20:22-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Typically, the "natural" form of connectivity as an ecological property perceived by organisms is modeled as a continuous surface of permeability, which is the corollary to disturbance. This can be accomplished by most geographic information systems (GIS) able to model in grid/raster format. A critical component of this form of modeling is the recognition that connectivity and disturbance are perceived and responded to differently by different organisms and ecological processes. This variety in responses is one of the most challenging parts of attempting to represent connectivity in spatial modeling. Typically, the most accurate connectivity models are for single species/processes and are developed based on information about the species/process.&lt;ref&gt;LaPoint, S., P. Gallery, M. Wikelski, and R. Kays. 2013. Animal behavior, cost-based corridor models, and real corridors. Landscape Ecology, 28: 1615-1630.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little, and often no evidence that spatial models, including those described here, can represent connectivity for the many species or processes that occupy many natural landscapes. The disturbance-based models are used as the basis for the binary representations of connectivity as paths/corridor/linkages through landscapes described below.

Circuitscape is an open source program that uses circuit theory to predict connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes for individual movement, gene flow, and conservation planning. Circuit theory offers several advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Landscapes are represented as conductive surfaces, with low resistances assigned to habitats that are most permeable to movement or best promote gene flow, and high resistances assigned to poor dispersal habitat or to movement barriers. Effective resistances, current densities, and voltages calculated across the landscapes can then be related to ecological processes, such as individual movement and gene flow.

Graphab is a software application devoted to the modelling of landscape networks. It is composed of four main modules: graph building, including loading the initial landscape data and identification of the patches and the links; computation of the connectivity metrics from the graph; connection between the graph and exogenous point data set; visual and cartographical interface.
Graphab runs on any computer supporting Java 1.6 or later (PC under Linux, Windows, Mac...). It is distributed free of charge for non-commercial use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10798">'''Leaf area index''' ('''LAI''') is a [[dimensionless quantity]] that characterizes plant [[Canopy (forest)|canopies]]. It is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (''LAI = leaf area / ground area, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'') in [[broadleaf]] [[Canopy (forest)|canopies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = D.J. | year = 1947 | title = Comparative physiological studies on the growth of field crops: I.

LAI ranges from 0 (bare ground) to over 10 (dense conifer forests).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Interpretation and application ==
[[Image:LAI Respiration.gif|thumb|right]]
LAI is used to predict photosynthetic [[primary production]], evapotranspiration and as a reference tool for [[crop]] growth. As such, LAI plays an essential role in [[theoretical production ecology]]. An inverse exponential relation between LAI and light interception, which is linearly proportional to the primary production rate, has been established:{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

:&lt;math&gt;P=P_\max \left(1-e^{-c\cdot LAI}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; designates the maximum [[primary production]] and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; designates a crop-specific growth [[coefficient]]. This inverse exponential function is called the '''primary production function'''.

== Determining LAI ==
LAI can be determined directly by taking a [[statistically significant]] [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of foliage from a [[Canopy (ecology)|plant canopy]], measuring the leaf area per sample plot and dividing it by the plot land surface area. Indirect methods measure canopy geometry or light extinction and relate it to LAI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breda | first1 = N | year = 2003 | title = Ground-based measurements of leaf area index: A review of methods, instruments and current controversies | url = http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/392/2403.full | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 2403–2417 | doi=10.1093/jxb/erg263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct methods===
Direct methods can be easily applied on [[deciduous]] species by collecting leaves during leaf fall in traps of certain area distributed below the canopy. The area of the collected leaves can be measured using a leaf area meter or an [[image scanner]] and image analysis software (ImageJ) and mobile applications ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.petioleapp.petiole&amp;hl=en Petiole], [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heaslon.EasyLeafArea&amp;hl=en Easy Leaf Area]). The measured leaf area can then be divided by the area of the traps to obtain LAI. Alternatively, leaf area can be measured on a sub-sample of the collected leaves and linked to the leaf dry mass (e.g. via [[Specific leaf area|Specific Leaf Area]], SLA cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g). That way it is not necessary to measure the area of all leaves one by one, but weigh the collected leaves after drying (at 60–80&amp;nbsp;°C for 48 h). Leaf dry mass multiplied by the [[specific leaf area]] is converted into leaf area.&lt;br /&gt;
Direct methods in [[evergreen]] species are necessarily destructive. However, they are widely used in crops and pastures by harvesting the vegetation and measuring leaf area within a certain ground surface area. It is very difficult (and also unethical) to apply such destructive techniques in natural ecosystems, particularly in forests of [[evergreen]] tree species. Foresters have developed techniques that determine leaf area in [[evergreen]] forests through [[Tree allometry|allometric]] relationships.&lt;br /&gt;
Due to the difficulties and the limitations of the direct methods for estimating LAI, they are mostly used as reference for indirect methods that are easier and faster to apply.

===Indirect methods===
[[File:Hemiphoto monarch habitat1.jpg|thumb|A [[Hemispherical photography|hemispherical photograph]] of [[Canopy (forest)|forest canopy]]. The ratio of the area of canopy to [[sky]] is used to approximate LAI.]]
Indirect methods of estimating LAI ''in situ'' can be divided in two categories:

# indirect contact LAI measurements such as plumb lines and inclined point quadrats{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}&lt;!-- (Gower et al., 1999; Scurlock et al., 2001;
Jonckheere et al., 2004a) --&gt;
# indirect non-contact measurements

Due to the subjectivity and labor involved with the first method, indirect non-contact measurements are typically preferred. Non-contact LAI tools, such as [[hemispherical photography]],  Hemiview Plant Canopy Analyser from Delta-T Devices, the CI-110 Plant Canopy Analyzer [http://www.cid-inc.com/products/leaf-area-lai/plant-canopy-imager] from [[CID Bio-Science]], LAI-2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer [https://web.archive.org/web/20110707070653/http://www.licor.com/env/products/area_meters/LAI-2200/] from [[LI-COR Biosciences]] and the [http://www.decagon.com/products/instruments/ceptometer-par-lai-instruments-2/accupar-lp-80/ LP-80 LAI ceptometer] [http://www.decagon.com/ag_research/canopy/lp80.php] from [[Decagon Devices]], measure LAI in a non-destructive way. [[Hemispherical photography]] methods estimate LAI and other canopy structure attributes from analyzing upward-looking [[fisheye lens|fisheye]] photographs taken beneath the plant canopy. The LAI-2200 calculates LAI and other canopy structure attributes from solar radiation measurements made with a wide-angle optical sensor. Measurements made above and below the canopy are used to determine canopy light interception at five angles, from which LAI is computed using a model of radiative transfer in vegetative canopies. The LP-80 calculates LAI by means of measuring the difference between light levels above the canopy and at ground level, and factoring in the leaf angle distribution, solar zenith angle, and plant extinction coefficient. Such indirect methods, where LAI is calculated based upon observations of other variables (canopy geometry, light interception, leaf length and width,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blanco |first=F.F. |author2=Folegatti, M.V.  |year=2003 |title=A new method for estimating the leaf area index of cucumber and tomato plants |journal=Horticultura Brasileira |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=666–669 |doi=10.1590/S0102-05362003000400019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.) are generally faster, amenable to automation, and thereby allow for a larger number of spatial samples to be obtained. For reasons of convenience when compared to the direct (destructive) methods, these tools are becoming more and more important.

===Disadvantages of methods===
The disadvantage of the direct method is that it is destructive, time consuming and expensive, especially if the study area is very large.

The disadvantage of the indirect method is that in some cases it can underestimate the value of LAI in very dense canopies, as it does not account for leaves that lie on each other, and essentially act as one leaf according to the theoretical LAI models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilhelm | first1 = W.W. | last2 = Ruwe | first2 = K. | last3 = Schlemmer | first3 = M.R. | year = 2000 | title = Comparisons of three Leaf Area Index Meters in a Corn Canopy | url = | journal = Crop Science | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1179–1183 | doi=10.2135/cropsci2000.4041179x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignorance of non-randomness within canopies may cause underestimation of LAI up to 25%, introducing path length distribution in the indirect method can improve the measuring accuracy of LAI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.rse.2014.08.032 | volume=155 | title=Indirect measurement of leaf area index on the basis of path length distribution | year=2014 | journal=Remote Sensing of Environment | pages=239–247 | last1 = Hu | first1 = Ronghai | last2 = Yan | first2 = Guangjian | last3 = Mu | first3 = Xihan | last4 = Luo | first4 = Jinghui}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lichte Trough''' ({{coord|76|25|S|30|0|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is an undersea trough named for Professor [[Heinrich Lichte]] (1910–1988), a [[geodesist]] who specialized in [[glaciology]]. The name was proposed by Dr. [[Heinrich Hinze]] of the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], [[Bremerhaven]], Germany, and was approved by the [[Advisory Committee for Undersea Features]] in June 1997.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

'''Lop Nur''' or '''Lop Nor''' (from a [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] name meaning "Lop Lake"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mummies of Urümchi|first=Elizabeth|last=Barber|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|page=125|quote=Two groups have laid claim to ''nor'', the second half of ''Lop Nor''. ''Nor'' is Mongol for "lake" and occurs as part of many lake names in Xinjiang and other parts of Central Asia, while ''nur'' is Uyghur for "bright" (as in the white of the salt flats). Mongol probably wins this one. But ''lop'' is opaque in both languages and in Chinese too, a fact suggesting that the name goes back to a time before Turks, Mongols, or Chinese had entered the territory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a former [[Salt lakes in China|salt lake]], now largely dried up, located between the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and [[Kumtag Desert|Kumtag]] deserts in the southeastern portion of the [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region]]. Administratively, the lake is in Lop Nur [[Towns of the People's Republic of China|town]] ({{zh|s=[[:zh:罗布泊镇|罗布泊镇]] |p=Luóbùpō zhèn}}), also known as Luozhong ({{zh|labels=no |s=罗中 |p=Luózhōng}}) of [[Ruoqiang County]], which in its turn is part of the [[Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture]].

The lake system into which the [[Tarim River]] and [[Shule River]] empty is the last remnant of the historical post-glacial Tarim Lake, which once covered more than {{convert|10000|km2|abbr=on}} in the [[Tarim Basin]]. Lop Nur is hydrologically [[endorheic]]&amp;mdash; it is landbound and there is no outlet. The lake measured {{convert|3100|km2|abbr=on}} in 1928, but has dried up due to construction of dams which blocked the flow of water feeding into the lake system, and only small seasonal lakes and [[salt marsh|marshes]] may form. The dried-up Lop Nur Basin is covered with a salt crust ranging from {{convert|30|to|100|cm|abbr=on}} in thickness.

Lop Nur has been used as a nuclear testing site,&lt;ref name="nti"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the discovery of [[potash]] at the site in the mid-1990s it is also the location of a large-scale mining operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=51039 |title=Lop Nur, Xinjiang, China |publisher=Earth Observatory |date=June 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some restricted areas under military management and cultural relics protection points in the region, which are not open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.sina.cn/dpool/blog/s/blog_758fbe910101dv1z.html |script-title=zh:三问哈罗铁路 |publisher=《新疆哈密广播电视报》 |website=[[Sina Weibo]] |date=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From around 1800 BC until the 9th century the lake supported a thriving [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] culture. [[archaeology|Archaeologists]] have discovered the buried remains of settlements, as well as several of the [[Tarim mummies]], along its ancient shoreline. Former water resources of the Tarim River and Lop Nur nurtured the kingdom of [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]] since the second century BC, an ancient civilization along the [[Silk Road]], which skirted the lake-filled basin. Loulan became a client-state of the Chinese empire in 55 BC, renamed [[Shanshan]]. [[Marco Polo]] in his travels passed through the [[Lop Desert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/marcopolo00polouoft#page/98/mode/2up |author= J.M. Dent |title= The travels of Marco Polo the Venetian |chapter=Chapter 36: Of the Town of Lop Of the Desert in its Vicinity - And of the strange Noises heard by those who pass over the latter |year=1908 |pages=99–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the famous explorers [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]], [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], [[Sven Hedin]] and [[Aurel Stein]] visited and studied the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; It is also likely that Swedish soldier [[Johan Gustaf Renat]] had visited the area when he was helping the [[Zunghar]]s to produce maps over the area in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strindbergsmuseet.se/verken/Tal/fejd6.html August Strindberg, "En svensk karta över Lop-nor och Tarimbäckenet" (in Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kara-Koshun where the terminal lake was found in 1867 is located to the south-west of Lop Nor, and the lake had shifted back to Lop Nor by the time this map was drawn. Taitema Lake was a smaller transit lake and located to the west of Kara-Koshun.]]

The lake was given various names in ancient Chinese texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E8%B3%87%E6%B2%BB%E9%80%9A%E9%91%91/%E5%8D%B7019 Zizhi Tongjian] Original text: 蒲昌海，一名泑澤，亦名鹽澤，亦名輔日海，亦名穿蘭，亦名臨海，在沙州西南。 Translation; Puchang Hai, another name is You Ze, also called Yan ze, Furi Hai, Chuan Lan, and Lin Hai. It is located to the south-west of Shazhou ([[Dunhuang]]).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Shiji]]'' it was called Yan Ze (鹽澤, literally Salt Marsh), indicating its [[salt lake|saline]] nature, and near which was located the ancient [[Loulan Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%8F%B2%E8%A8%98/%E5%8D%B7123 Shiji] Original text: 而樓蘭、姑師邑有城郭，臨鹽澤。Translation: The cities of Loulan and [[Gushi culture|Gushi]] have walls; they lie near to Yan Ze.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hanshu]]'' it was called Puchang Hai (蒲昌海, literally Sea of Abundant Reed) and was given a dimension of 300 to 400 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' (roughly 120–160&amp;nbsp;km) in length and breadth,&lt;ref name="hanshu"&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%BC%A2%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B7096%E4%B8%8A Hanshu] Original text: 蒲昌海，一名鹽澤者也，去玉門、陽關三百餘里，廣袤三四百里。其水亭居，冬夏不增減，皆以為潛行地下，南出於積石，為中國河雲. Translation: Puchang Hai, also named Yan Ze, lies over 300 ''li'' from the [[Yumen Pass|Yumen]] and [[Yangguan Pass]], and is 300 to 400 ''li'' in length and breadth. Its waters are stagnant, and do not increase or decrease during the winter or summer. It is generally believed that the water flows hidden underground, emerges south at Jishi, and becomes the Chinese River (meaning [[Yellow River]]).&lt;/ref&gt; indicating it was once a lake of great size. These early texts also mentioned the belief, mistaken as it turns out, that the lake joins the [[Yellow River]] at [[Amne Machin|Jishi]] through an underground channel as the source of the river.&lt;ref name="hanshu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaOXCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270&amp;lpg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Buddhism |editor= Lou Yulie |page=270 |isbn=9789047427971|publisher=Brill |date=2015-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The lake was referred to as the "Wandering Lake" in the early 20th century due to the Tarim River changing its course, causing its terminal lake to alter its location between the Lop Nur dried basin, the Kara-Koshun dried basin and the Taitema Lake basin.&lt;ref name="lopdesert"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhao Songqiao and Xia Xuncheng |title=Evolution of the Lop Desert and the Lop Nor |journal=The Geographical Journal |volume=150 |issue=3 |pages=311–321 |year =1984 |doi=10.2307/634326 |jstor=634326}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift of the terminal lake caused some confusion amongst the early explorers as to the exact location of Lop Nur. Imperial maps from the [[Qing Dynasty]] showed Lop Nur to be located in similar position to the present Lop Nur dried basin, but the Polish geographer Mikołaj Przewalski instead found the terminal lake at Kara-Koshun in 1867. [[Sven Hedin]] visited the area in 1900-1901 and suggested that the Tarim river periodically changed its course to and fro between its southbound and northbound direction, resulting in a shift in the position of the terminal lake. The change in the course of the river, which resulted in Lop Nur drying up, was also suggested by Hedin as the reason why ancient settlements such as Loulan had perished.&lt;ref name="dsr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/rarebook/06/index.html.en |title=Hedin, the Man Who Solved the Mystery of the Wandering Lake: Lop Nor and Lou-lan |author=Makiko Onishi and Asanobu Kitamoto |publisher=Digital Silk Road}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, due to human intervention, the terminal lake shifted its position back to Lop Nur. The lake measured 2400&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area in 1930-31. In 1934 Sven Hedin&lt;ref&gt;Sven Hedin, The Wandering lake, 1940. The river was also called the Kum Darya ('Sand River.) The Gizi map of Xinjiang calls it the Konche, which is probably a mistake.&lt;/ref&gt; went down the new Kuruk Darya ('Dry River') in a canoe. He found the delta to be a maze of channels and the new lake so shallow that it was difficult to navigate even in a canoe. In 1900 he had walked the dry Kuruk Darya in a caravan.
In 1952 the terminal lake then shifted to Taitema Lake when the Tarim River and Konque River were separated through human intervention, and Lop Nur dried out again by 1964. In 1972, the Great West Sea Reservoir (Daxihaizi, 大西海子) was built at Tikanlik, water supply to the lake was cut off, and all the lakes for the most part then dried out, with only small seasonal lakes forming in local depressions in Taitema.&lt;ref name="lopdesert"/&gt; The loss of water to the lower Tarim River Valley also led to the deterioration and loss of [[Populus|poplar]] forests and [[tamarix]] shrubs that used to be extensively distributed along the lower Tarim River Valley forming the so-called 'Green Corridor'. In 2000, in an effort to prevent further deterioration of the ecosystem, water was diverted from [[Lake Bosten]] in an attempt to fill the Taitema Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chinapage.com/river/tarim/news2004.html |title=Quenching thirst in Tarim Basin |author=Liang Chao |work=China Daily |date=2004-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510121711/http://chinapage.com/river/tarim/news2004.html |archivedate=2012-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taitema Lake however had shifted {{convert|30|to|40|km}} westwards during the past 40 years due in part to the spread of the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause of the destabilization of the desert has been the cutting of poplars and willows for firewood; in response, a restoration project to reclaim the poplar forests was initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Kara-Koshun dried basin may be considered part of the greater Lop Nur.&lt;ref name="lopdesert"/&gt;

On 17 June 1980, Chinese scientist [[Peng Jiamu]] disappeared while walking into Lop Nur in search of water. His body was never found, and his disappearance remains a mystery. 3 On June 1996, the Chinese explorer [[Yu Chunshun]] died while trying to walk across Lop Nur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Lop Nur Nuclear Weapons Test Base===
{{See also|List of nuclear weapons tests of China}}

China established the Lop Nur [[nuclear test site|Nuclear Test Base]] on 16 October 1959 with Soviet assistance in selection of the site, with its headquarters at Malan, about {{convert|125|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Qinggir]].&lt;ref name="nti"/&gt; The first [[List of nuclear tests#China|Chinese nuclear bomb test]], codenamed "[[596 (nuclear test)|596]]", occurred at Lop Nur in 1964. The PRC detonated its first [[hydrogen bomb]] on 17 June 1967. Until 1996, 45&amp;nbsp;[[Nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] were conducted. These nuclear tests were conducted by dropping bombs from aircraft and towers, launching missiles, detonating weapons underground and in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuclear Weapons Databook|last=Burrows and Fieldhouse|first=Andrew S. and Richard|publisher=Boulder: Westview Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages= 380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Jun Takada, a Japanese scientist known for prominently opposing the tests as "the Devil's conduct", published the results of his computer simulation which suggests - based on deaths from Soviet tests - that 190,000 people could have died in China from nuclear-related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= China’s nuclear tests allegedly caused 190k deaths |url=http://digitaljournal.com/article/271274 |author=Subhabrata Das |publisher= Digital Journal |date=Apr 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enver Tohti, an exiled pro-Uyghur independence activist, claimed that cancer rates in the province of Xinjiang were 30 to 35% higher than the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/did-chinas-nuclear-tests/ |title=Did China's Nuclear Tests Kill Thousands and Doom Future Generations?|author=Zeeya Merali|publisher=Scientific American |date=July 8, 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 1996, China conducted its 45th and final nuclear test at Lop Nor, and issued a formal moratorium on nuclear testing the following day, although further [[subcritical]] tests were suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/2239/subcritical-testing-at-lop-nor |title=Subcritical Testing at Lop Nor |author=Jeffrey Lewis |publisher= Arms Control Wonk |date= April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, China announced plans to spend $1 million to clean up the Malan ({{lang|zh|马兰}}, ''Mǎlán'') nuclear base in Lop Nor to create a [[red tourism]] site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Technology/2012/10/17/China-to-open-ex-atomic-site-to-tourists/UPI-85691350470700/|title=China to open ex-atomic site to tourists|date=2012-10-17|accessdate=2012-10-27|publisher=United Press International|location=Beijing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lop Nur is home to the [[wild Bactrian camel]], which is a separate species from the [[Bactrian camel]]. The camels have continued to breed naturally despite the nuclear testing. After China signed the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996, the camels were classified as an [[endangered species]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name="iucn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hare|first1=J.|title=''Camelus ferus''|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/63543/0|website=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|doi=10.2305/iucn.uk.2008.rlts.t63543a12689285.en|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the cessation of nuclear testing at Lop Nur, human incursions into the area have caused a decline in the camel population.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2001"&gt;{{cite news|title='New' camel lives on salty water|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1156212.stm|work=BBC|date=6 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wild"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildcamels.com/|title=Wild Camel|publisher=Wild Camel Protection Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild Bactrian camels have been classified as [[critically endangered]] since 2002&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; and approximately half of the 1400 remaining wild Bactrian camels live on the former Lop Nur test base, which has been designated the [[Lop Nur Wild Camel National Nature Reserve]].

==Transportation==
A highway from [[Hami City|Hami]] to Lop Nur (Xinjiang Provincial Hwy 235) was completed in 2006.&lt;ref name=rail/&gt;

The [[Hami–Lop Nur Railway]], which runs {{Convert|374.83|km|abbr=on}} north to Hami, along the same route, opened to freight operations in November 2012. The railway is used to transport [[potash|potassium-rich salt]] mined at the lake to the [[Lanzhou–Xinjiang Railway]].&lt;ref name=rail&gt;[http://english.gov.cn/2010-03/04/content_1547778.htm China starts building railway into "sea of death"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229091955/http://english.gov.cn/2010-03/04/content_1547778.htm |date=2012-02-29 }}, GOV.cn, Thursday, 4 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological sites around Lop Nur==
Given the extreme dryness and resulting thin population, remains of some buildings survived for a significant period of time. When ancient graves, some a few thousand years old, were opened the bodies were often found to be mummified and grave goods well preserved. The earliest sites are associated with an ancient people of Indo-European origin.

===Loulan===
{{ main|Loulan Kingdom }}
Loulan or Kroran was an ancient kingdom based around an important oasis city already known in the 2nd century BCE[1] on the north-eastern edge of the Lop Desert. It was renamed [[Shanshan]] after Chinese took control of the kingdom in 1st century BCE. It was abandoned some time in the seventh century. Its location was discovered by [[Sven Hedin]] in 1899, who excavated some houses and found a wooden [[Kharosthi]] tablet and many Chinese manuscripts from the [[Western Jin Dynasty]] (265–420).&lt;ref name="dsr"/&gt; [[Aurel Stein]] also excavated at the site in the beginning of the 20th century, while Chinese archaeologists explored the area in the latter part of the 20th century. A mummy called the "Beauty of Loulan" was found at a cemetery site on the bank of Töwän River.

===Xiaohe Burial Site===
{{ main|Xiaohe Tomb complex}}
The Xiaohe Tomb complex is located to the west of Lop Nur. This [[bronze-age]] burial site is an oblong sand dune, from which more than thirty well preserved mummies have been excavated. The entire [[Xiaohe Tomb complex]] contains about 330 tombs, about 160 of which have been violated by grave robbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; 
A local hunter guided the Swedish explorer and archeologist [[Folke Bergman]] to the site in 1934. An excavation project by the Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute began in October 2003. A total of 167 tombs have been dug up since the end of 2002 and excavations have revealed hundreds of smaller tombs built in layers, as well as other precious artifacts. In 2006, a valuable archeological finding was uncovered: a boat-shaped coffin wrapped in ox hide, containing the mummified body of a young woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Qäwrighul===
In 1979, some of the earliest of the [[Tarim mummies]] were discovered in burial sites at Qäwrighul (Gumugou), which is located to the west of Lop Nur, on the Könchi (Kongque) river. Forty-two graves, most of which dated from 2100-1500 BC, were found. There were two types of tomb at the site, belonging to two different time periods. The first type of burial featured shaft pit graves, some of which had poles at either end to mark east and west. Bodies were found extended, usually facing east, and sometimes were wrapped in wool weavings and wearing felt hats. Artifacts found included basketry, wheat grains, cattle and sheep/goat horns, bird bone necklaces and bracelets, nephrite beads, and fragments of copper (or bronze), although no pottery was discovered.

The second type of burial, from a later period, also consisted of shaft pit graves, surrounded by seven concentric circles of poles. Six male graves were found, in which the bodies were extended on their backs, and facing towards the east. Few artifacts were found, except for some traces of copper, or bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Kwang-tzuu Chen and Fredrik T. Hiebert (1995). "The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang in Relation to Its Neighbors".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5685">'''Map Communication Model''' is a theory in [[cartography]] that characterizes mapping as a process of transmitting geographic information via the map from the cartographer to the end-user.&lt;ref name="Ubi06"&gt;[http://ubikcan.blogspot.com/2006/08/map-communication-model-and-critical.html "The map communication model and critical cartography"], Ubikcan blogspot 8.13.2006. Retrieved 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
By the mid-20th century, according to Crampton (2001) "cartographers as [[Arthur H. Robinson]] and others had begun to see the map as primarily a communication tool, and so developed a specific model for map communication, the map communication model (MCM)".&lt;ref name="JWC01"&gt;Crampton, J.W. (2001). "Maps as Social Constructions: Power, Communication, and Visualization". In: ''Progress in Human Geography''. 25, 235-252&lt;/ref&gt; This model, according to Andrews (1988) "can be grouped with the other major [[Communication theory|communication model]]s of the time, such as the Shannon-Weaver and Lasswell models of communication. The map communication model led to a whole new body of research, methodologies and map design paradigms"&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, S.K. (1988). "Applications of a Cartographic Communication Model to a Tactual Map Design". In: ''The American Cartographer''. 15, 183-95.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the implications of this communication model according to Crampton (2001) "endorsed an “epistemic break” that shifted our understandings of maps as communication systems to investigating them in terms of fields of power relations and exploring the “mapping environments in which knowledge is constructed”... This involved examining the social contexts in which maps were both produced and used, a departure from simply seeing maps as artifacts to be understood apart from this context".&lt;ref name="JWC01"&gt;Crampton, J.W. (2001). "Maps as Social Constructions: Power, Communication, and Visualization". In: ''Progress in Human Geography''. 25, 235-252&lt;/ref&gt;

A second implication of this model is the presumption inherited from [[positivism]] that it is possible to separate facts from values. As Harley stated: Maps are never value-free images; except in the narrowest Euclidean sense they are not in themselves either true or false. Both in the selectivity of their content and in their signs and styles of representation maps are a way of conceiving, articulating, and structuring the human world which is biased towards, promoted by, and exerts influence upon particular sets of social relations. By accepting such premises it becomes easier to see how appropriate they are to manipulation by the powerful in society.&lt;ref name="CC08"&gt;Richard Donohue (2008). [http://geographer.situatedlaboratories.org/critical_cartography.php Critical cartography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705231614/http://geographer.situatedlaboratories.org/critical_cartography.php |date=2008-07-05 }}. Retrieved 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Although this was a postwar discovery, the Map Communication Model (MCM) has its roots in [[information theory]] developed in the [[telephone]] industry before the war began.  Mathematician, inventor, and teacher [[Claude Shannon]] worked at [[Bell Labs]] after completing his Ph.D. at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1940.  Shannon applied mathematical theory to information and demonstrated that communication could be reduced to binary digits ([[bit]]s) of positive and negative circuits. This information could be coded and transmitted across a [[Electronic noise|noisy]] [[interface (computer science)|interface]] without losing any meaning.  Once the information was received it was then decoded by the listener; the integrity of the information remained intact.  In producing meaningful sounds that could be measured for quality, Shannon produced the beginning of information theory and [[digital communication]] through circuits of on and off [[electric switch|switches]].

Shannon developed his ideas more thoroughly in the 1940s at the same time that [[geographer]] and  [[cartographer]] [[Arthur H. Robinson]] returned from the [[Second World War]] during which he had served as cartographer for the military.  Robinson found that cartographers were significantly limited because artists could make more effective maps than geographers.  Upon returning from the war, Robinson worked to remedy this problem at [[Ohio State University]] where he was a graduate student.  His ''The Look of Maps'' emphasizes the importance of lettering, map design, map structure, color, and technique.  

Information theory helped turn the map into a medium of communicating information. Although Robinson never articulated a map model that could govern the new scientific pursuit of maps, his role in the war led to an understanding of the practical need for maps based on science not art.  Robinson opened the door for others to apply Shannon’s ''Mathematical Theory of Communication'' to the design of maps.  British geographer Christopher Board developed the first MCM in 1967 but it was cumbersome and poorly measured a map’s information quality.  The Czech Geographer Kolácný’s 1969 version made several key improvements to Board’s model.  These versions of the MCM helped cartographers realize the problems that Robinson noted as a war cartographer and helped articulate the discipline in terms of science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1598">'''[[Markov chain]] [[geostatistics]]''' uses [[Markov chain]] spatial models, [[simulation]] [[algorithm]]s and associated spatial [[correlation]] measures (e.g., [[transiogram]]) based on the Markov chain random field theory, which extends a single [[Markov chain]] into a multi-dimensional random field for geostatistical modeling. A Markov chain random field is still a single spatial Markov chain. The spatial Markov chain moves or jumps in a space and decides its state at any unobserved location through interactions with its nearest known neighbors in different directions. The data interaction process can be well explained as a local sequential Bayesian updating process within a neighborhood. Because single-step transition probability [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] are difficult to estimate from sparse [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] data and are impractical in representing the complex spatial [[heterogeneity]] of states, the '''[[transiogram]]''', which is defined as a [[transition probability]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] over the distance [[lag]], is proposed as the accompanying spatial measure of Markov chain random fields.

'''Melbourne's Living Museum of the West''' is an [[ecomuseum]] and community [[social history]] museum in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne's]] western suburb of [[Maribyrnong, Victoria|Maribyrnong]]. It was established as part of Victoria's [[Anniversary#Latin-derived numerical names|sesquicentenary]] (150 year anniversary) in 1984, along with the [[Children's Museum]] and the [[Museum of Chinese Australian History]].

==Origin and philosophy==

Generally referred to as the ''Living Museum of the West'', or just ''the Living Museum'', it was established in 1984, specifically to address the perceived disadvantage of Melbourne's Western Region, which as well as being generally a working class, industrial area, was considered to lack many cultural facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00864b.htmv eMelbourne - The Encyclopedia of Melbourne Online]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecomuseum concept was adopted to focus on the environment, landscape and people and their culture, and to involve the community in recording and preserving their own stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cv.vic.gov.au/organisations/3162/melbournes-living-museum-of-the-west/ Culture Victoria organisations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Described as "Australia's first [[ecomuseum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/org/527/about/ CAN Collections Australia Museum Listing]&lt;/ref&gt; the museum focusses on the stories of people of Melbourne's Western Region, extending from Footscray to Bacchus Marsh, and from Sunbury to Werribee. Initially intended to be a ''museum without walls'' and focussing on oral history recording and community participation, it did not have a tradition objects collection until more recently.

==Collection==

The Living Museum maintains a Resources Collection which includes over the collection of documents, tapes and artefacts which form the Resource Centre, as well as the personnel and facilities at the Museum itself. The collections include published books, reports and articles; maps, plans and drawings; a photographic archive; oral histories; and exhibition materials. It contains about 500 artefacts, 5000 archival records (primarily copies of documents and plans), 10,000 photographic images (both copies of historical photographs and contemporary photos documenting the region and museum activities). Its most significant core collection is the oral history recordings, which focusses on the "themes of migration, work, environment, culture, heritage, industry, women in the community and the everyday stories of the people of Melbourne's West".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/org/527 Collections Australia Network (CAN)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

From its beginnings in Footscray, the Living Museum expanded its collection and staff to outgrow the small premises, and with assistance from [[Arts Victoria]], which provided core funding from its establishment, it moved to a refurbished industrial site. The Living Museum is now housed in the former industrial buildings at [[Pipemakers Park]] Van Ness Avenue, Maribyrnong, which were refurbished under a $2 million [[Australian Bicentenary]] grant in 1987–88, and are owned by [[Parks Victoria]], with a lease arrangement with the Living Museum. The venue includes a visitor and research centre with staff offices, and large exhibition space in converted bluestone industrial buildings. These have been used for a variety of exhibitions, concerts, performances and community events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlymelbourne.com.au/melbourne_details.php?id=10889 Only Melbourne Melbourne's Living Museum of the West]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum's Patron is former Victorian premier [[Joan Kirner]].

The Living Museum of the West commenced operations in a small house in David Street [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]], with a staff of 4 and a much larger number of people employed under job creation schemes, who undertook research, oral history recording and preparation of exhibitions.

==Recent events==

In 2011 the Living Museum went into decline, having lost its recurrent core funding from Arts Victoria, and struggled to secure replacement income. For a time it was dominated by a group of local artists known as [[MREAM]] (Maribyrnong River Edge Art Movement, who wished to develop the Pipemakers Park as artists studios and exhibition space, but were subsequently outvoted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maribyrnong-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/push-on-for-living-museum-of-the-west/ Push on for Living Museum of the West ''Maribyrnong Leader'' 29 March 2011 by Paula Maud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125142901/http://maribyrnong-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/push-on-for-living-museum-of-the-west/ |date=25 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the Living Museum re-established the collection in the Visitor Centre in Pipemakers Park. The Museum is currently in the process of digitising the collection and presenting and publishing the archives on the internet. With a new and dynamic committee of management, that includes original and new members, the Living Museum continues to develop programs of exhibitions and events in the historic buildings along the Maribyrnong River.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3833">'''Nordicity''' ({{Lang-fr|nordicité}}) is the degree of [[north]]ernness. The concept was developed by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[geographer]] [[Louis-Edmond Hamelin]] in the 1960s based on previous work done in the [[Soviet Union]]. Hamelin's point was that northern territories – like [[northern Canada]] – cannot be identified based on a single criterion, but that there was a continuum based on a number of natural and human factors.

Hamelin developed an index he called ''Valeurs polaires'' (Polar values) or VAPO, where the North Pole had a VAPO of 1000. The nordicity index had 10 natural and human components:
#[[latitude]]
#[[summer|summer heat]]
#[[effect of sun angle on climate|annual cold]]
#[[ice#Types of ice|types of ice]]
#total [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]
#natural [[vegetation]] cover
#accessibility by [[transport|means other than air]]
#[[aviation|air service]]
#[[population]]
#[[economic indicator|degree of economic activity]]

Each component was graded on the scale of 0–100 where 100 represented extreme nordicity, with the VAPO representing the sum of these ten components. Hamelin proposed that areas with a VAPO of more than 200 should be considered in "the North". He subdivided [[Canada]] into ''Extreme North'', ''Far North'', ''Middle North'', and ''Near North'' ({{Lang-fr|Extrême Nord, Grand Nord, Moyen Nord, Pré-Nord}}) based on their VAPO. Using the VAPO, most of Canada outside the Southern [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Lower Mainland]], the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], the [[Quebec City-Windsor Corridor]], and most of the [[Maritimes]] exhibits some degree of nordicity. [http://dl1.yukoncollege.yk.ca/anth220/pictures/viewer$49]. At the other end, the ''Extreme North'' included the northern portion of Canada's [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Arctic Archipelago]]. The rest of the archipelago and [[tundra]] zone as well as parts of the [[boreal forest]] were included in the ''Far North''.

The term is used by the Canadian government that has a set system for measuring nordicity. This system is used for determining a number of regulations in fields such as environmental protection, infrastructure, and many others. [[Northern Canada]], apropos, is normally divided into three areas.  The ''Middle North'' covering the northern parts of most provinces, as well as parts of the territories is largely populated by those of [[Europe]]an descent and has significant resource extraction if a low population.  The ''Far North'' covers the northern part of the continent and the southern Arctic Archipelago.  The ''Extreme North'' covers the northernmost islands and is largely uninhabitable.  Other countries have their own systems of measuring nordicity.

The idea of nordicity and the changing conceptions of what is the north has also recently become a subject for historians.

It is a component of organic land care and organic [[sustainable landscaping]] which adapt the principles and methods of  [[sustainable gardening]] and [[organic farming]] to the care of lawns and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organiclandcare.net A model for sustainable landscaping practices.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

[[File:CC500BAT.png|thumb|Rechargeable electric mulching-mower]]

Alternatives include the use of [[beneficial insects]] and natural predators such as [[nematode]]s to prevent infestation of lawns with pests such as [[crane fly]] larvae and [[ants]], and preventing fungal infections through physical maintenance such as effective mowing and raking. Other 'environmentally friendly' techniques for caring for a lawn include [[irrigation]] only when the lawn shows signs of drought stress and then watering deeply - minimizing needless water consumption. Using low volume [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]]s provides more penetration without [[Surface runoff|runoff]].  [[Lawnmower]]s with a [[mulching]] function can useful in reducing fertilizer use by allowing clippings that are cut so minutely that they can settle into the grass inconspicuously to [[decompose]] into the [[soil]].

===Organic fertilizers===

A primary element of organic lawn management is the use of [[compost]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/composting/ U.S. EPA Composting]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[compost tea]] to reduce the need for fertilization and to encourage healthy soil that enables turf to resist pests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uos.harvard.edu/fmo/landscape/organiclandscaping/ Organic Landscaping at Harvard University]&lt;/ref&gt; A second element is mowing tall (3" - 4") to suppress weeds and encourage deep grass roots,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustland.umn.edu/maint/mowing.htm University of Minnesota Sustainable Urban Landscape Mowing Practices]&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving grass clippings on the lawn as fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/dep/recycle/reduce/dtg.htm MassDEP Don't Trash Grass]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, fertilize in the fall, not the spring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/3574 Cornell University, Lawn Care Without Pesticides]&lt;/ref&gt;  Organic lawns often benefits from slice seeding&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organiclawncarecolumbus.com/slice-seeding.html Slice Seeding for Organic Lawn Stimulation]&lt;/ref&gt; and aeration more frequently due to the importance of a strong root system.

Synthetic (inorganic based) [[fertilizers]] are made in a chemical process that uses fossil fuel and contributes to global warming. They also greatly increase the amount of nitrogen entering the global nitrogen cycle which has a serious negative impact on the organization and functioning of the world's ecosystems, including accelerating the loss of biological diversity and decline of coastal marine ecosystems and fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/watertrain/nitrogen.html U.S. EPA The Global Nitrogen Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nitrogen fertilizer releases N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere after application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2009GL041675.shtml Carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in urban turf, Amy Townsend-Small1 and Claudia I. Czimczik1, GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 37, L02707]&lt;/ref&gt; Organic fertilizer nitrogen content is typically lower than synthetic fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/soils/organic.html Arizona Cooperative Extension Organic Fertilizers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lawnbrothers.org/organics.html | title=Organic vs. Chemical Lawn Care | publisher=Lawn Bros | accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiversity===

Organic lawns contribute to [[biodiversity]], by definition, when they contain more than one or two grass species. Examples of additional lawn and grasslike species that can be encouraged in organic lawns include dozens of grass species (eight for ryegrass alone, [[Lawn#Grass alternatives|sedges]], mosses, clover, vetches, trefoils, yarrow, [[Lawn#Ground cover alternatives|ground cover alternatives]], and other mowable plants&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Lolium&amp;SPECIES_XREF=&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK= Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/la/la_004.cfm Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Low-Maintenance Lawns]&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiversity increases the functioning and stress tolerance of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/107/4/1443.abstract Sustaining multiple ecosystem functions in grassland communities requires higher biodiversity]&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of biodiversity is a significant environmental issue brought up by the use of lawns&lt;ref&gt;[http://alstonbrothers.com/organic-yard-care-establishing-throughout-the-u-s/ Organic Lawn Care Movement Developing Across the U.S.]&lt;/ref&gt; with grassroots groups emerging to promote this method of lawn care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organiclandcare.net Northeast Organic Farming Association Organic Land Care Program]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain low-growing grass species can also eliminate the need for mowing, thus also being environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greensolutionslpc.com/organic-lawn-care-management/ | title=Organic Lawn Care Management | publisher=Green Solutions | accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clover]] is often mixed with grasses for its ability to fix nitrogen into the soil and fertilize the lawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cloverlawn.org/ | title=Benefits of a Clover Lawn | publisher=CloverLawn.org | accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6754">The '''Petén Basin''' is a geographical subregion of [[Mesoamerica]], primarily located in northern [[Guatemala]] within the [[Petén (department)|Department of El Petén]], and into [[Campeche|Campeche state]] in southeastern [[Mexico]]. 

During the Late Preclassic and Classic periods of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican chronology]] many major centers of the [[Maya civilization]] flourished, such as [[Tikal]] and [[Calakmul]]. A distinctive Petén-style of [[Maya architecture]] and [[Maya script|inscriptions]] arose. The archaeological sites [[La Sufricaya]] and [[Holmul]] are also located in this region.

== History==
[[Image:Nakbe str.JPG|left|250px|thumb| ''Nakbé, Mid Preclassic (600 BCE) Palace remains, The Mirador Basin'']]By the first half of the 1st millennium BCE, the Petén and [[Mirador Basin]] of this region were already well-established with a number of [[List of Maya sites|monumental sites and cities]] of the [[Maya civilization]]. Significant Maya sites of this Preclassic era of [[Mesoamerican chronology]] include [[Nakbé]], [[El Mirador]], [[Naachtun]], [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] and [[Cival]] in the [[Mirador Basin]].

===Classic Period===
[[File:Peten Map v3 May archaeological sites.gif|thumb|350px|right|Map of [[Petén (department)|Petén Department]], showing principal settlements and archaeological sites.]]
Later, Petén became the heartland of the Maya Classic Period (c. 200 &amp;ndash; 900 CE).  At its height around 750 it is estimated that the Petén Basin was home to several million people, being one of the most [[population density|densely populated]] regions of the world at the time. Some areas are estimated to have had ca 2,000 people/km².  [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican agriculture]] was very extensive, and there is some evidence suggesting that the land was depleted by unsustainable [[overfarming]], resulting in a [[famine]] which was an important factor in the collapse of the [[Classic Maya]] states of this area.  The population is estimated to have dropped by two-thirds between the mid 9th century and the mid 10th century.

;Archaeological sites
Archaeological sites preserve important remnants of the Classic Maya in Petén Basin, such as: 
*On the [[Usumacinta|Usumacinta River]]:  [[Uaxactún]], [[Tikal]], [[Holmul]], [[La Sufricaya]], [[Machaquilá]], [[Naranjo]], [[Nakum]], [[Piedras Negras, Guatemala|Piedras Negras]], [[Altar de Sacrificios]]
*On the San Pedro Mártir River: Waka' formerly [[El Perú]]
*In the [[Petexbatún]] area: [[Seibal|Ceibal]] and [[Aguateca]]
*On [[Pasión River|La Pasión River]]: [[Cancuén]] 
*On Lake Yaxha: [[Topoxté]] and [[Yaxhá]] 
[[Image:tikalpano.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Tikal]], rising above jungle canopy.]] 
[[Tikal National Park]] is one of the only sites to be designated a [[World Heritage Site]] for both archaeological and biodiversity reasons.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/64/ |title=Tikal National Park |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher= |access-date=2018-04-14 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many thousands of house mounds where worshipers and workers once lived were discovered at Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Heider, K. (2014). Tikal. San Francisco: California, USA : Kanopy Streaming. http://library.simmons.edu/record=b2156058~S0.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish colonial period===
{{main|Spanish conquest of Petén}}
After the Classic Period collapse the population of the area continued to drop dramatically, especially after the introduction of [[smallpox]] along with European explorers.  The smallpox plague arrived around 1519 or 1520, preceding by several years the first [[Europe]]ans to visit the region.  [[Hernán Cortés]] led the first expedition to pass through the Petén Basin, in 1524 to 1525, and reported that the region mostly had small hamlets separated by thick forest, with [[Tayasal]] being the only sizable inhabited city they observed.

After Cortés' expedition, the [[New Spain|colonial Spanish]] largely tried to [[Spanish conquest of Petén|conquer Petén Basin]], with several attempts mainly from [[Belize]] and [[Alta Verapaz]], for generations until an expedition from [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Belize]] and [[Cobán]] in [[Alta Verapaz]], succeeded in conquering the last independent Maya [[polity|polities]] around 1697, such as  [[Zacpeten]] (capital of the [[Kowoj]] Maya),  the [[Itza]] Maya center of [[Tayasal]], and other towns in the Lake Petén Itza region such as Quexil (modern Spanish name, in Maya: ''Ek'ixil'') and [[Yalain]]. (''see:'' [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]]).

The Spanish town of Flores was established atop the site of [[Tayasal]], but this remained an isolated backwater through the colonial [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] era and after Mexican independence.  When Guatemalan President [[Rafael Carrera]] sent a small force to Flores to claim the region for Guatemala in the 1840s, the governments of [[Mexico]] and the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] state decided the Petén Basin area was not worth the trouble of contesting.

'''Phallic Rock''' is a [[precambrian]] [[granite]] [[rock formation]] in [[Carefree, Arizona]], [[United States]]. The formation is caused by [[spheroidal weathering]] whereby the composition of the granite and its crystal structure facilitated the development of rounded corners and its unique [[phallus|phallic]] tubular shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blkmtnconservancy.org/geology2.html Black Mountain Conservancy Geology Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202090031/http://www.blkmtnconservancy.org/geology2.html |date=2007-02-02 }}, www.blkmtnconservancy.org, ©2000 Stephanie Bradley (accessed 28 February 2007) &lt;/ref&gt; The formation is at the eastern foot of Black Mountain and can be found approximately 400 feet east of Tom Darlington Drive on Stagecoach Pass Road. The formation is best viewed from the western side looking east. There is a dirt pull-off on the side of Stagecoach Pass Road with enough room for several vehicles.

Researchers surveyed flow-marked slopes with the ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]''{{'s}} [[Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars|CRISM]] and although there is no [[Spectrography|spectrographic]] evidence for actual water,&lt;ref name="WRD-20140218" /&gt; the instrument has directly imaged perchlorate salts thought to be dissolved in water brines in the subsurface.&lt;ref name="Ojha NG2015" /&gt; This may indicate the water quickly evaporates upon reaching the surface, leaving only the salts. The cause of the surface darkening and lightening is poorly understood: a flow initiated by salty water (brine) could rearrange grains or change surface roughness in a way that darkens the appearance, but the way the features brighten again when temperatures drop is harder to explain.&lt;ref name=jpl/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa/&gt; However, in November 2018, it was announced that CRISM had fabricated some additional pixels representing the minerals alunite, kieserite, serpentine and perchlorate.&lt;ref name="SA-20181122"&gt;{{cite |last=Mcrae |first=Mike |title=One of NASA's Mars Exploration Tools Has a Glitch That Created The Illusion of Water |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-s-mars-reconnaissance-orbiter-has-a-glitch-that-created-the-illusion-of-water |date=22 November 2018 |work=ScienceAlert.com |accessdate=22 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Grossman 2018'&gt;[https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-reconnaissance-orbiter-glitch-liquid-water An orbiter glitch may mean some signs of liquid water on Mars aren't real].

==Hypotheses==
A number of different hypotheses for RSL formation have been proposed. The seasonality, [[latitude]] distribution, and brightness changes strongly indicate a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] material —such as water or liquid {{chem|C|O|2}} — is involved. One hypothesis is that RSL could form by rapid heating of nocturnal frost.&lt;ref name="Dundas2015"/&gt; Another one proposes flows of carbon dioxide, but the settings in which the flows occur are too warm for [[Dry ice|carbon-dioxide frost]] ({{chem|C|O|2}}), and at some sites is too cold for pure water.&lt;ref name="Dundas2015"/&gt; Other hypotheses include dry granular flows, but no entirely dry process can explain seasonal flows that progressively grow over weeks and months.&lt;ref name="McEwen EPSC2015"/&gt; Cornice avalanches is another hypothesis.  The idea is that wind collects snow or frost just past the peak of a mountain and then this becomes an avalanche after it warms up. [http://corniceavalanchesonmars.blogspot.com/]  Seasonal melting of shallow ice would explain the RSL observations, but it would be difficult to replenish such ice annually.&lt;ref name="McEwen EPSC2015"/&gt; However, as of 2015, direct observations of seasonal deposition of soluble salts strongly suggest that RSL involve [[brine]] (hydrated salts).&lt;ref name="Ojha NG2015" /&gt;

===Brines===

The leading hypothesis involves the flow of [[brine]]s —very salty water.&lt;ref name="Ojha NG2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WRD-20140218"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Adam |title=Strange Dark Streaks on Mars Get More and More Mysterious|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2014/02/flowing-lineae-water-mars/ |date=February 18, 2014 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=February 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/08/is-mars-weeping-salty-tears.html| title=Is Mars Weeping Salty Tears?| publisher=news.sciencemag.org| accessdate=August 5, 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814065220/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/08/is-mars-weeping-salty-tears.html| archivedate=August 14, 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=voanews&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/science-technology/NASA-Finds-Possible-Signs-of-Flowing-Water-on-Mars-126807133.html| title=NASA Finds Possible Signs of Flowing Water on Mars| publisher=voanews.com| accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20131210"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webster |first1=Guy |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |title=NASA Mars Spacecraft Reveals a More Dynamic Red Planet |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-361&amp;1#1 |date=December 10, 2013 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=December 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wall-Brines 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Mike |url=http://www.space.com/30673-water-flows-on-mars-discovery.html?adbid=10153086098981466&amp;adbpl=fb&amp;adbpr=17610706465 |title=Salty Water Flows on Mars Today, Boosting Odds for Life |work=Space.com |date=28 September 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt deposits over much of Mars indicate that brine was abundant in Mars's past.&lt;ref name=jpl/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/news/mro20110804.html| title=NASA Spacecraft Data Suggest Water Flowing on Mars|publisher=NASA|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity lowers the [[freezing point]] of water to sustain a liquid flow. Less saline water would freeze at the observed temperatures.&lt;ref name=jpl/&gt; Thermal infrared data from the [[Thermal Emission Imaging System]] (THEMIS) on board the ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'' orbiter, have allowed the temperature conditions under which RSL form to be constrained. While a small number of RSL are visible at temperatures above the freezing point of water, most are not, and many appear at temperatures as low as {{convert|-43|C|K}}. Some scientists think that under these cold conditions, a brine of [[iron(III) sulphate]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[calcium chloride]] ({{chem|Ca|Cl|2}}) is the most likely mode of RSL formation.&lt;ref name="Mitchell 2015"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mitchell |first=J. |last2=Christensen |first2=P. |title=RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE AND THE PRESENCE OF CHLORIDES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE OF MARS |url=http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2015/pdf/1624.pdf |format=PDF |conference=46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015) |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute |date=March 16–20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another team of scientists, using the [[Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars|CRISM]] instrument onboard MRO, reported that the evidence for hydrated salts is most consistent with the spectral absorption features of [[magnesium perchlorate]] (Mg(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[magnesium chloride]] (MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H2O)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sodium perchlorate]] ({{chem|Na|Cl|O|4}}).&lt;ref name="Ojha NG2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wall-Brines 2015"/&gt;

Experiments and calculations demonstrated that recurring slope lineae could be produced by the [[deliquescence]] and rehydration of hydrous chlorides and oxychlorine salts.  However, under present Martian atmospheric conditions there is not enough water to complete this process.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, A., et al.  2017.

These observations are the closest scientists have come to finding evidence of liquid water on the planet's surface today.&lt;ref name=jpl/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa/&gt; Frozen water, however, has been detected near the surface in many middle to high-latitude regions. Purported droplets of brine also appeared on struts of the [[Phoenix Mars Lander]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=droplets&gt;{{cite news| title=Mars Lander gets lucky break as 'water drops' discovered clinging to craft's leg| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1162923/Mars-Lander-gets-lucky-break-water-drops-discovered-clinging-crafts-leg.html| newspaper=Daily Mail UK| date=March 18, 2009| accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of water===
{{see also|Water on Mars|Groundwater on Mars}}

Liquid brine flows near the surface might explain this activity, but the exact source of the water and the mechanism behind its motion are not understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McEwen| first1=Alfred.S.| last2=Ojha| first2=Lujendra | last3=Dundas| first3=Colin M.| date=June 17, 2011| title=Seasonal Flows on Warm Martian Slopes| journal=Science| volume=333| issue=6043| pages=740–743| publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science| doi=10.1126/science.1204816| issn=0036-8075| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6043/740| accessdate=August 5, 2011| bibcode = 2011Sci...333..740M| pmid=21817049}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hirise&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/sim/science-2011-aug-4.php| title=Seasonal Flows on Warm Martian Slopes| publisher=hirise.lpl.arizona.edu| accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A hypothesis proposes that the needed water could originate in the seasonal oscillations of near-surface [[adsorbed]] water provided by the [[Atmosphere of Mars#Water|atmosphere]]; [[perchlorate]]s and other salts known to be present on the surface, are able to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment ([[hygroscopic]] salts),&lt;ref name="McEwen EPSC2015"/&gt; but the dryness of the Martian air is a challenge. Water vapor must be efficiently trapped over very small areas, and seasonal variation in the atmospheric column abundance of water vapor does not match the RSL activity over active locations.&lt;ref name="Dundas2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McEwen EPSC2015"&gt;{{cite conference |last=McEwen |first=A. |last2=Chojnacki |first2=M. |last3=Dundas |first3=C. |last4=L.

An analysis of data from the ''Mars Odyssey'' neutron spectrometer revealed that the RSL sites do not contain any more water than found at anywhere else at similar latitudes.  The authors concluded that RSL are not supplied by large, near-surface briny aquifers.  It is still possible with this data that water vapor from deeply buried ice, from the atmosphere, or from small deeply buried aquifers.&lt;ref name='Jack Wilson'/&gt;

===Dry sand flows===
Dry granular flow was proposed since the first observations of RSLs but this interpretation was ruled out because of the seasonality of the process. The first proposition of a seasonal triggering in a dry context was published in March 2017 using a Knudsen pump effect.&lt;ref name='Scmhidt Knudsen pump 2017'&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2917 Formation of recurring slope lineae on Mars by rarefied gas-triggered granular flows]. F. Schmidt, F. Andrieu, F. Costard, M. Kocifaj and A. G. Meresescu, ''Nature Geoscience'', 20 March 2017. {{doi|10.1038/ngeo2917}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors demonstrated that the RSLs stopped at an angle of 28° in Garni crater, in agreement with dry granular avalanche. In addition, the authors pointed out several limitations of the wet hypothesis, such the fact that the detection of water was only indirect (salt detection but not water). This theory pushed back the dry flow theory. 
Research published in November 2017 concludes that the observations are best explained by dry flow processes,&lt;ref name='dry flows 2017'&gt;[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7005 Recurring Martian Streaks: Flowing Sand, Not Water?].

''JPL News, NASA. 7 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; but the new research article acknowledged that hydrated salts could draw some humidity from the atmosphere and seasonal changes in hydration of salt-containing grains might result in some trigger mechanism for RSL grainflows, such as expansion, contraction, or release of some water, that would change the cohesion of grains and cause them to fall or "flow" downslope.&lt;ref name='dry flows 2017'/&gt; Furthermore, neutron spectrometer data by the ''[[Mars Odyssey]]'' orbiter obtained over one decade, was published in December 2017, and shows no evidence of water (hydrogenated regolith) at the active sites, so its authors also support the hypotheses of either short-lived atmospheric water vapour deliquesence, or dry granular flows. Nevertheless, the footprint of this instrument (~100 km) is much larger than the RSls (~100m).&lt;ref name='Jack Wilson'/&gt;

==Habitability==

These features form on Sun-facing slopes at times of the year when the local temperatures reach above the melting point for ice. The streaks grow in spring, widen in late summer and then fade away in autumn. This is hard to model in any other way except as involving liquid water in some form, though the streaks themselves are thought to be a secondary effect and not a direct indication of dampness of the regolith. Although these features involve water in some form, the water could be either too cold or too salty for life. At present they are treated as potentially habitable, as "Uncertain Regions, to be treated as Special Regions".

The "Special Regions" assessment says of them:&lt;ref name="RummelBeaty2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rummel|first1=John D.|last2=Beaty|first2=David W.|last3=Jones|first3=Melissa A.|last4=Bakermans|first4=Corien|last5=Barlow|first5=Nadine G.|last6=Boston|first6=Penelope J.|last7=Chevrier|first7=Vincent F.|last8=Clark|first8=Benton C.|last9=de Vera|first9=Jean-Pierre P.|last10=Gough|first10=Raina V.|last11=Hallsworth|first11=John E.|last12=Head|first12=James W.|last13=Hipkin|first13=Victoria J.|last14=Kieft|first14=Thomas L.|last15=McEwen|first15=Alfred S.|last16=Mellon|first16=Michael T.|last17=Mikucki|first17=Jill A.|last18=Nicholson|first18=Wayne L.|last19=Omelon|first19=Christopher R.|last20=Peterson|first20=Ronald|last21=Roden|first21=Eric E.|last22=Sherwood Lollar|first22=Barbara|last23=Tanaka|first23=Kenneth L.|last24=Viola|first24=Donna|last25=Wray|first25=James J.|title=A New Analysis of liquid "Special Regions": Findings of the Second MEPAG Special Regions Science Analysis Group (SR-SAG2)|journal=Astrobiology|volume=14|issue=11|year=2014|pages=887–968|issn=1531-1074|doi=10.1089/ast.2014.1227|pmid=25401393|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Beaty/publication/268444482_A_new_analysis_of_Mars_Special_Regions_findings_of_the_second_MEPAG_Special_Regions_Science_Analysis_Group_SR-SAG2/links/547c9b0b0cf27ed9786229dd.pdf&lt;!--|page=902--&gt;|bibcode=2014AsBio..14..887R}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Although no single model currently proposed for the origin of RSL adequately explains all observations, they are currently best interpreted as being due to the seepage of water at &gt;{{conv|250|K|C F}}, with &lt;math&gt;a_w&lt;/math&gt; [water activity] unknown and perhaps variable. As such they meet the criteria for Uncertain Regions, to be treated as Special Regions. There are other features on Mars with characteristics similar to RSL, but their relationship to water is much less likely."

Here a "Special Region" is defined as a region on the Mars surface where Earth life could potentially survive.

They were first reported on 5 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warm-Season Flows on Slope in Newton Crater|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/multimedia/pia14472.html|website=NASA Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were already suspected as involving flowing brines back then, as all the other models involved water in some form. They were finally proven to involve water after detection of hydrated salts (brine) that change their hydration state rapidly through the season. This was reported on 28 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34379284 Martian salt streaks 'painted by liquid water'] - BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amos|first1=Jonathan|title=Martian salt streaks 'painted by liquid water'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34379284|publisher=BBC Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20150928b"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Video Highlight - NASA News Conference - Evidence of Liquid Water on Today's Mars

The spacecraft that observed them, the ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'', is in a slowly precessing Sun-synchronous orbit inclined at 93 degrees (orbital period 1 hr 52 minutes). Each time it crosses the Mars equator on the sunny side, South to North, the time is 3:00 pm, in the local solar time on the surface, all year round. This is the worst time of day to spot brines from orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Telecommunications|url=http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/MRO_092106.pdf|publisher=JPL|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the press conference, the researchers gave a rough estimate of a total annual flow of at least 100,000 tons for the entire Valles Marineres region. In this calculation they assumed only 5% water in the solution and a film with a thickness of 10&amp;nbsp;mm which is about what is needed for the material to flow at all.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRQ5B_ik2dU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3284 press conference on the discovery of indirect evidence of water flowing in the RSL] - the video link here is to the question and answer about the quantity of water involved&lt;/ref&gt; They are amongst the most favoured candidate sites to support Earth bacteria brought by contaminated landers.

The '''Sous''' region (also spelt '''Sus''', '''Suss''', '''Souss''' or '''Sousse''') ([[Berber language|Berber]]: ⵙⵓⵙ, Sus) is a region in mid-southern [[Morocco]]. Geologically, it is the [[Alluvial plain|alluvial basin]] of the [[Sous River]] (''Asif en Sus''), separated from the [[Sahara]] desert by the [[Anti-Atlas]] Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ucQ2DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|title=The Souss‐Massa River Basin, Morocco|last=Allah|first=Redouane Choukr|last2=Ragab|first2=Ragab|last3=Bouchaou|first3=Lhoussaine|last4=Barceló|first4=Damià|date=2017-02-25|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319511313|location=|pages=30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural vegetation in the Sus region is [[savanna]] dominated by the [[Argan]] (''Argania spinosa''), a local [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] tree found nowhere else;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ucQ2DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|title=The Souss‐Massa River Basin, Morocco|last=Allah|first=Redouane Choukr|last2=Ragab|first2=Ragab|last3=Bouchaou|first3=Lhoussaine|last4=Barceló|first4=Damià|date=2017-02-25|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319511313|location=|pages=103|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the area is now a [[UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]] to protect this unique habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V_IMx-YYvJYC&amp;pg=PA389|title=Morocco.

== History ==
A well irrigated area, this has been one of Morocco's most fertile regions for centuries, known since at least the eleventh century for its cultivation and export of olive and [[sugar]]. The golden age of the Sus was in the seventeenth century during the era of the kingdom of [[Tazerwalt]], when the region enjoyed autonomy and profited from both the trans-Saharan gold trade and the sale of sugar to Portuguese, Dutch and English traders. The centre for foreign trade during this time was [[Agadir]], a city 10&amp;nbsp;km north of the mouth of the Sous river.

== Population ==
The Sus is inhabited by [[Berber languages|Berber]]-speaking peoples of [[Mesmouda|Imesmoden]] and [[Senhaja|Iẓnagen]]; aside from some [[Darija]]-speaking tribes, the main inhabitants are the [[Shilha people|Susians]], speakers of a distinct Berber language called [[Shilha language]], ''Tacelḥit''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9329">A '''Tapere''' or Sub-District is a low level of  traditional land subdivision on five of the Lower [[Cook Islands]] ([[Rarotonga]], [[Mangaia]], [[Aitutaki]], [[Atiu]], and [[Mauke]]), comparable to the [[ahupua'a]] of the main [[Hawaiian Islands]]. Among the populated raised islands, only [[Mitiaro]] is not subdivided into tapere. The remaining southern Cook Islands, [[Manuae (Cook Islands)|Manuae]], [[Palmerston Island|Palmerston]] and  [[Takutea]] are [[atoll]]s and/or uninhabited, and therefore not subject to this type of traditional subdivision. The atolls of the northern Cook Islands are subdivided into ''motu'' (populated atoll islets), instead.

A tapere is a subdivision of a district (the major island subdivision) or ''puna'', which is headed by a district chiefs or ''Pava'' (in the case of the Island of Mangaia). A tapere is normally headed by a ''[[mataiapo]]'' (a chief of a major lineage) or ''[[ariki]]'' (a High Chief, the titular head of a tribe). It is occupied by the ''matakeinanga'', the local group composed of the residential core of a major lineage, plus affines and other permissive members.&lt;ref name=vicgloss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-CroLan-_N70147.html|title=GLOSSARY AND CONVENTIONS|work=LAND TENURE IN THE COOK ISLANDS|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the tapere lands are subdivided among the minor lineages, each of which was headed by a ''[[Rangatira (Cook Islands)|rangatira]]'' or ''[[kōmono]]'', or by the mataiapo himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-CroLan-c3-3.html#n71|title=Rights of the Lineage|work=LAND TENURE IN THE COOK ISLANDS|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below that level, there is the ''uanga'', the extended family, the residential core of which occupied a household.&lt;ref name=vicgloss/&gt;

Historically, taperes were almost always wedge-shaped - the boundaries beginning at defined points on the outer reef and running inland to enclose an ever narrowing strip of land until converging at a point in or near the center of the island. By this type of delineation, any one tapere included every category of soil type and land surface of the island, from the typically mountainous interior, where forest products were collected, through fertile valleys where the major food crops were grown, across the rocky coastal strip of elevated fossil coral (makatea), out to the lagoon and fringing reef.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/duffy/ARB/085/LTITCI.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912231841/http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/duffy/ARB/085/LTITCI.pdf |date=September 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2741">'''U-TDOA''', or '''Uplink-Time Difference of Arrival''', is a wireless location technology that relies on sensitive receivers typically located at the cell towers to determine the location of a mobile phone.

== How does U-TDOA work? ==
U-TDOA determines location based on the time it takes a signal to travel from a mobile phone to each of the sensitive receivers called Location Measurement Units (LMUs). By using the timing information from multiple LMUs, U-TDOA calculates the mobile phone’s location, using a technique called [[multilateration]].

Because U-TDOA is a network-based location technology, it does not require the mobile phone to have any special chip, hardware, or software in it. As a result, it can locate any type of mobile phone.

Since U-TDOA requires physical access to the cellular network's cell towers ([[Base transceiver station|base transceiver stations]] or BTS), it is only available to the owner of the sensor network, which is typically the carrier. Therefore, the solution is generally not available when [[roaming]].

== Mission-critical safety and security ==
U-TDOA is uniquely suited for mission-critical safety and security applications:
:* Locate mobile phones with very high accuracy
:* Locate mobile phones with very high reliability
:* Locate all mobile phones, even those that are not GPS-enabled — the location capability cannot be disabled by the mobile phone user in any way  
:* Locate mobile phones in any environment (urban, suburban, rural, open country, whether indoors, outdoors, or in-vehicle, etc.)

== U-TDOA vs. GPS ==
U-TDOA works with all mobile phones and is very accurate, typically identifying location within 50 meters.

[[Global Positioning System|GPS]] relies on special chipsets in wireless devices to calculate location in relationship to orbiting satellites. GPS can also locate phones within 50 meters. However, not every wireless subscriber has a GPS-enabled phone. Also, GPS requires a clear view to multiple satellites in order to function, so GPS cannot locate a wireless caller who is indoors or surrounded by tall buildings. 

Today, in the United States, Sprint and Verizon use a form of GPS known as [[Assisted GPS]] while AT&amp;T Mobility and T-Mobile use U-TDOA for their [[Enhanced 9-1-1|E9-1-1]] solutions.
