In the mathematical field of [[graph theory]], the '''26-fullerene graph''' is a [[polyhedral graph]] with ''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;26 vertices and ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;39 edges. Its planar embedding has three hexagonal faces (including the one shown as the external face of the illustration) and twelve pentagonal faces. As a planar graph with only pentagonal and hexagonal faces, meeting in three faces per vertex, this graph is a [[fullerene]]. The existence of this fullerene has been known since at least 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Properties==
The 26-fullerene graph has &lt;math&gt;D_{3h}&lt;/math&gt; [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|prismatic symmetry]], the same group of symmetries as the [[triangular prism]]. This symmetry group has 12 elements; it has six symmetries that arbitrarily permute the three hexagonal faces of the graph and preserve the [[Orientability|orientation]] of its planar embedding, and another six orientation-reversing symmetries.&lt;ref name=marcusanu/&gt;

The number of fullerenes with a given even number of vertices grows quickly in the number of vertices; 26 is the largest number of vertices for which the fullerene structure is unique. The only two smaller fullerenes are the graph of the [[regular dodecahedron]] (a fullerene with 20 vertices) and the graph of the [[truncated hexagonal trapezohedron]] (a 24-vertex fullerene),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OEIS|A007894}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the two types of cells in the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]].

The 26-fullerene graph has many [[perfect matching]]s. One must remove at least five edges from the graph in order to obtain a subgraph that has exactly one perfect matching. This is a unique property of this graph among fullerenes in the sense that, for every other number of vertices of a fullerene, there exists at least one fullerene from which one can remove four edges to obtain a subgraph with a unique perfect matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The vertices of the 26-fullerene graph can be labeled with sequences of 12 [[bit]]s, in such a way that distance in the graph equals half of the [[Hamming distance]] between these [[bitvector]]s.
This can also be interpreted as an [[isometric embedding]] from the graph into a 12-dimensional [[taxicab geometry]]. The 26-fullerene graph is one of only five fullerenes with such an embedding.&lt;ref name=marcusanu&gt;{{citation

==In popular culture==
In 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a puzzle involving [[Hamiltonian path]]s in this graph, taking advantage of the correspondence between its 26 vertices and the 26 letters of the English alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/the-hamiltonian-puzzle|title=The Hamiltonian Puzzle|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 4, 2009|first=John|last=Tierney|authorlink=John Tierney (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mathematica-journal.com/issue/v11i3/contents/superhamilton/superhamilton.pdf|title=The Icosian game, revisited|last=Pegg|first=Ed, Jr.|authorlink=Ed Pegg Jr.|journal=The Mathematica Journal|volume=11|issue=3|year=2009|pages=310–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">'''Abelson's paradox''' is an [[applied statistics]] [[paradox]] identified by [[Robert P. Abelson]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, R. P. (1985).

'''Andrzej Grzegorczyk''' ({{IPAc-pl|'|a|n|d|rz|e|j|-|g|rz|e|'|g|o|r|cz|y|k}}; 22 August 1922 – 20 March 2014) was a Polish [[logician]], mathematician, philosopher, and [[ethicist]] noted for his work in [[computability]], [[mathematical logic]], and the [[foundations of mathematics]].

==Historical family background==

Andrzej Grzegorczyk's foundational family background has its origins in the intellectual, religious, patriotic, and nationalist traditions at least of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], the [[Congress Poland]], the [[Second Polish Republic]], and the [[Polish People's Republic]]. This historical luggage was foundational for his life and work in the communist Poland, assured him the system safety against tough repressions by the state authorities, which affected many Polish intellectuals and academicians.

He was the only child to the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galician]] family of well-educated and wealthy parents, his father Piotr Jan Grzegorczyk (1894–1968) was a [[Polonistics|polonist]] and [[Historian of literature|historian]] of [[Polish literature]] involved into [[literary criticism]], [[Bibliography|bibliographic studies]], and [[chronicle]]s of the Polish cultural life. Among many works, in 1967 Piotr authored ''Index Lexicorum Poloniae'' which listed almost without selection all Polish both dictionaries and encyclopedias except biographical ones published prior to 1964, in 1964 he published a bibliographic-literary monograph ''Lew Tołstoj w Polsce'' (Lev Tolstoy in Poland) which discussed reception of the works by a Russian writer [[Leo Tolstoy|Lev Tolstoy]] in the Polish literature, and full bibliographic record of the Polish literature for 1925–1931. In 1914, he matriculated at a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Lwów]], while in the years of the [[World War I]] he provided military service at first the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions (1914–1918)]] since 1915 and then since 1918 of the [[:pl:Wojsko Polskie (II RP)|Polish Army]] of the then newly created [[Second Polish Republic]], which he finished in the rank of [[Polish Armed Forces rank insignia|Captain]]. In 1921–1925, he studied [[Polonistics]] at the University of Warsaw, where he developed in linguistics and literature supervised by a [[Historian of literature|historian]] of [[Polish literature]] [[:pl:Bronisław Gubrynowicz|Bronisław Ludwik Gubrynowicz]], a corresponding member of the then top academy of sciences [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (PAU) in [[Kraków]] since 1928 and a member of the nationalist-conservative political party [[National Democracy|National Democracy (''"Endecja"'')]] who in 1909 co-edited the first critical edition of a Polish [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] [[Juliusz Słowacki]]'s works and since 1920 was both an active member of the [[Lwów Scientific Society]] and the head of the Department of Polish Literature of the University of Warsaw with the position of a full professor, the editor-in-chief of a scientific quarterly ''[[:pl:Pamiętnik Literacki|Pamiętnik Literacki]]'' (Literary Diary) for 1925–1932, and since 1926 the founding editor-in-chief of a scientific-literary monthly ''[[:pl:Ruch Literacki (miesięcznik)|Ruch Literacki]]'' (Literary Movement) to which he made Piotr the secretary of editorial board until his death in 1933 when Piotr became the next editor-in-chief until 1937 and prepared full bibliography of this journal for 1926–1936. Since 1932 he managed the sections on translations of Polish literature and literary life in Poland, and published articles on the pages, of the ''Rocznik Literacki'' (Literary Annual). He was a [[Polyglotism|polyglot]] with a great passion to the [[Italian literature]], in particular in 1924 he authored a Polish-language popular handbook in the [[Yiddish]] language ''Język Żydowski (Żargon): Samouczek dla Polaków'' (Jewish Language (Jargon): A Tutorial for Poles) published in Lwów and Warsaw by Książnica Polska (Polish Library) of the Polish Society of University Teachers''.'' During the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|1939–1945 Nazi-Soviet occupation of Poland]], he stayed in Warsaw where he collaborated with the Polish both underground press and secret publishing houses, prepared the work ''Polska'' w ''poezji angielskiej'' (Poland in English Poetry) in 1944, while in 1945 he relocated to Kraków where he dedicated to an amateur bibliographic work. In 1960 he restarted publishing with the ''[[:pl:Ruch Literacki (dwumiesięcznik)|Ruch Literacki]]'', which after the 20-year absence was restored as a cultural-literary bimonthly, and was appointed an editorial board member therein, while in 1955 he restarted publishing with the ''Rocznik Literacki'' for which he was writing an article when he suddenly died in 1968. Piotr had never been and wanted to be a professor, the Polish both interwar and post-war state authorities had never awarded him by either order or medal, but, as the recognition of his many-year dedicated work to the Polish academia, in 1945 he was elected a member of the Historico-Literary Commission of the [[Polish Academy of Learning|PAU]] in [[Kraków]] which along with the [[Jagiellonian University in Kraków]] restored the [[interwar Poland]]'s academic press, and, after in 1951 the communist authorities strongly restricted activities of the [[Polish Academy of Learning|PAU]] by purely political reasons due to its members' intellectual and political independence to create manifestly subordinated academy of sciences named the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (PAS), he became a member of the Kraków Division of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]] created in 1957 to replace the [[Polish Academy of Learning|PAU]]'s disloyal structures.

Andrzej's mother Zofia Jadwiga née Zdziarska was a [[Medical Doctor]] from a purely [[Polish landed gentry]] family of the [[Gozdawa coat of arms]] originated in a [[landed estate]] [[Zdziar Wielki]] in the [[Płock Governorate]], the [[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom of Poland]] created in the [[personal union]] with the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias Alexander I]] by the [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland|1815 Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland]] which was never fully respected by the [[Tsarist autocracy]] and under the [[Namiestnik of Poland|Viceroy of the Congress Poland]] former General of the [[Napoleonic army]] [[Józef Zajączek]] gave the autonomy in an independent and sovereign judiciary and separated state-administrative organs such like both [[Sejm of Congress Poland|Parliament]] and [[Army of Congress Poland|Army]] with the national monetary and measure system, as a result of the [[Congress of Vienna|1815 Congress of Vienna]] due to the fall of the [[First French Empire]] under the [[Emperor of the French]] [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte who by the [[Treaties of Tilsit|1807 Treaties of Tilsit]] and the [[Constitution of the Duchy of Warsaw]] of 22 July 1807 formed the [[List of French client states|French client state]] [[Duchy of Warsaw]] as the first Polish statehood on the map of Europe since the three-part [[Partitions of Poland|1772–1795 Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] under the both [[King of Saxony]] and [[Duke of Warsaw]] [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]] of the [[House of Wettin]] and since October 1807 the Prime Minister [[Stanisław Małachowski]] of the [[Nałęcz coat-of-arms]], who already in December 1807 became the president of the Senate in the [[Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw]] until 1809 and in 1788–1792 was the [[:pl:Marszałek sejmu (I Rzeczpospolita)|Marshal]] of the [[Four-Year Sejm|Great Sejm]] famous for adoption of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution of 3 May 1791]] blocked by the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Empress and Autocrat of All the Russias]] [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II the Great]] at the invitation of the [[Targowica Confederation|1792 Targowica Confederation]] established by the Polish-Lithuanian [[magnate]]s in [[Saint Petersburg]] to form the [[Second Partition of Poland|1792 Second Partition]] as a result of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] army's defeat in the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792|1972 Polish–Russian War]] which forced the last [[King of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] to join the confederation and abdicate in November 1795 in the aftermath of the [[Kościuszko Uprising|1974 Kościuszko Uprising]] suppressed by the forces of Empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] and the [[King of Prussia]] [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] to form the base for the [[Third Partition of Poland|1795 Third Partition]] along with the last [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the first [[Emperor of Austria]] [[Francis II and I]]. Zofia's family members belonged to the [[Catholic Church in Poland|Roman Catholic Church]], although presented generally strongly left-wing [[political orientation]], in particular her paternal grandfather Paweł Zdziarski made military service to the [[January Uprising|1863–1864 January Uprising]] against occupation of the [[Russian Empire]] in the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], was multiple times repressed by the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] authorities of the Congress Poland, and was liked and respected by the local Polish society. Her mother Zofia Ludwika née Sąchocka of the [[Zagłoba coat of arms]] was a school teacher in Płock, her father Bolesław Julian Zdziarski (1863–1931) was born during the [[January Uprising|January uprising]] and in 1884 matriculated at the present-day [[Marshal Stanisław Małachowski High School, Płock|Marshal Stanisław Małachowski High School in Płock]], then named the Governorate Gymnasium in Płock, in the period of enhanced [[Russification of Poles during the Partitions|Russification]] of the Polish schools in the aftermath of the fall of the January Uprising. Already in the school years, Bolesław became well known for an active participation in the [[Anti-Russian sentiment|anti-Russian]] [[conspiration]]s among students, after completion of secondary education he joined the [[:pl:Instytut Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego i Leśnictwa|Institute of Household and Forestry]] in [[Puławy]] to be expelled with a [[Wolf ticket (Russia)|wolf ticket]] in May 1887 for participation in the student riots, and was able to complete the final examinations and graduate only in 1889 when his article on too small salaries for Płock Governorate's [[farmworker]]s appeared in print and was awarded by a student prize. Under the pseudonym ''Gozdawa,'' on the pages of a Polish-language newspapers ''[[:pl:Prawda. Tygodnik Polityczny, Społeczny i Literacki|Prawda: tygodnik polityczny, społeczny i literacki]]'' (Truth: political, social, and literary weekly) and the ''Dziennik Płocki'' (Płock Daily), he published Polish-language articles dedicated to socio-political problems of Polish villages in the Russian Empire, developed a broad social activity in [[Mazovia]] known as a person dedicated to his family and the manager of a small landed estate and household in a village [[Cieśle, Gmina Bodzanów|Cieśle near Bodzanów]] given him by his father. Thanks to Bolesław's efforts, there was created the Society of Mutual Credit which was the first ever such organization in the Congress Poland, he created multiple cooperative dairies, secret Polish schools, volunteer fire departments, and provincial farm exhibitions, and, although in the [[Saint Petersburg]]'s Tsarist offices he won four conflicts against a Płock Governor [[:ru:Янович, Илиодор Александрович|Iliodor Aleksandrovich Yanovich]] who opposed creation of the Polish institutions, he was frequently accused of anti-Tsarist activities and imprisoned, for example in the [[Warsaw Citadel|Alexander Citadel of Warsaw]] which was built by the order of the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias Nicholas I]] implemented by the Prince of Warsaw and [[Viceroy of Poland|Viceroy of the Congress Poland]] for 1832–1856 [[Field Marshal (Russia)|Field Marshal]] [[Ivan Paskevich]] to strengthen the repressive control after successful suppression of the [[November Uprising|1830–1831 November Uprising]] also known as the Cadet Revolution, which in [[:pl:Uchwała Sejmu o detronizacji Mikołaja I|January 1831 dethroned the Emperor Nicholas I]] to openly declare the 1831 Polish-Russian War whose downfall caused the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''eternal incorporation''' by intensive [[Russification of Poles during the Partitions|Russification]] and economic-political Russian repressions such like abolishment of the [[Sejm of Congress Poland]] in favour of the [[Council of State (Kingdom of Poland)|Second Council of State]] and marriage of the [[Army of Congress Poland]] with the [[Imperial Russian Army]] under the [[Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland|1832 Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland]] followed by the [[Great Emigration|1831–1870 Great Emigration]] of the political and social exiles, and which was the place of imprisonment and execution of the [[January Uprising|1863–1864 January Uprising]]'s leading figures including its dictator General [[Romuald Traugutt]] who left the [[Imperial Russian Army]] in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel for his military merits in the successful Austrian-Russian suppression of the [[1848 Hungarian Revolution|1848–1849 Hungarian Revolution]] and the Russian defeat in the [[Crimean War|1853–1856 Crimean War]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[British Empire|British]]-[[Second French Empire|French]]-[[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] alliance. By the long lasting imprisonment, in 1902 Bolesław was forced to sell the landed estate in Cieśle and to stop construction of a small fertilizers factory, he bought the landed estate in a village [[Zdziar Wielki]] near Płock, and, after the [[Second Polish Republic]] along with [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic states]] declared independence from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1917–1918 in the aftermath of the [[Russian Empire]]'s collapse by abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias Nicholas II]] forced by the societal opposition of the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Russian Revolution]] and the results of the [[World War I]], he provided a military service to the [[Polish–Soviet War|1919–1921 Polish–Soviet War]] and today his various merits to the locals are recognized by the Bolesław Zdziarski street in the city of [[Płock]].

Furthermore, Bolesław's paternal grandmother Barbara Zdziarska née Tokarska was a sister of a Polish [[jurist]] Michał Józef Tokarski who Germanized to Michael von Tokarski already under the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1803–1806 studied law at the [[University of Königsberg]] in the [[East Prussia]] to begin practice of a court hearer in the Płock Regency of the [[New East Prussia]]. Soon after creation the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], Tokarski was appointed a judge to the Justice Chamber of the Free [[Royal city in Poland|Royal City]] of Płock in 1807 and both an assessor to the Tribunal of I Instance in Płock for the [[Płock Department]] by [[Duke of Warsaw|Duke]] [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]] and a judge in the Criminal Justice Court in [[Toruń]] for the [[Płock Department]] and the [[Bydgoszcz Department]] in 1808, to become finally a prosecutor to the Criminal Court in Płock for the [[Płock Department]] and the [[Łomża Department]] for 1810–1815. Meanwhile, after the [[Russian Empire]] officially annexed majority of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] as a result of the [[1815 Congress of Vienna]], he was appointed a lawyer to the Supreme Instance Court of the [[Congress Poland]] in Warsaw for 1815–1827 by the [[:pl:Rząd Tymczasowy Królestwa Polskiego (1815)|Provisional Government of the Congress Poland]] under a Russian Major General [[Vasily Lanskoy]] who in the aftermath of the [[Sixth Coalition]] victory over the [[First French Empire]] in the [[Battle of Leipzig|1813 Battle of Lipsk]] also known as the Battle of the Nations became the Governor-General of the Duchy of Warsaw, in 1827 became a prosecutor general at the [[Appellate court]] of the [[Congress Poland]] in [[Warsaw]], in 1833 was promoted to the post of a judge of the Supreme Instance Court of the Congress Poland and got the fourth highest [[Table of Ranks|Russian Empire's civil service rank]] of an [[Active State Councillor]], by the Russian Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s appointment at the request of the Viceroy [[Ivan Paskevich]] in 1842 became a senator at the [[:pl:Warszawskie Departamenty Rządzącego Senatu|Warsaw Departments IX for civil and X for criminal judicature]] of the [[Governing Senate]] of the Russian Empire established by the [[Ukase|Tsarist ukase]] of 1841 and the organic decree of 1842 as the subsequent anti-Polish repression which liquidated both the Supreme Instance Court and the [[Council of State (Kingdom of Poland)|Second Council of State]] of the Congress Poland, and was decorated the Knight of the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov)|Imperial Order of Saint Stanislaus]] of 1st and 2nd class and the Knight of the [[Order of Saint Vladimir|Imperial Order of Saint Prince Vladimir]] of 3rd class with a personal greatest acknowledgements by the Viceroy Paskevich. In particular, in 1824, Tokarski became more famous for defense of a Polish political activist [[Walerian Łukasiński]], an officer of the [[4th Regiment of Line Infantry]] of the [[Army of the Congress Poland]] in the rank of Major who created the [[secret organization]] [[:pl:Wolnomularstwo Narodowe|''Wolnomularstwo Narodowe'']] (National [[Freemasonry]]) for 1819–1820 to replace this by the pro-independence secret organization ''[[:pl:Narodowe Towarzystwo Patriotyczne|Narodowe Towarzystwo Patriotyczne]]'' (National Patriotic Society) in the course of secession of the members from the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] officially annexed in 1815 by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] from the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] to revolve against the Prussian forces in the [[Greater Poland uprising (1846)|1846 Wielkopolska Uprising]] and the [[Greater Poland uprising (1848)|1848 Poznań Uprising]] during the [[Spring of Nations|1848 Spring of Nations]] when Tokarski died, whose detention by the Tsarist jurisprudence started in 1822 was updated in 1825 by the judicial sentence of 14-year imprisonment in solitary incarceration illegally prolonged until his death in 1868 at the Oreshek Fortress in [[Shlisselburg]] to make him one of the symbolic figures of the Polish struggle for independence in the 19th and 20th centuries against the Russian Empire's state authorities who regarded him as the main ringleader of the [[November Uprising|1830–1831 November Uprising]]. Thanks to his dedication and loyalty to the occupation authorities of Poland, Tokarski owned landed estates and provided the parallel widespread activity in the Polish [[Freemasonry]] of the Scottish Rite, already in 1810 got the 3° (Master) along with the positions of both an active member and deputy speaker of the Saint John's German-language Symbolic Lodge ''Albertine zur Vollkommenheit'' (Albertine under Excellence) later transformed into a Polish-language Provincial Lodge ''Albertyna Doskonałości'' (Albertine of Excellence) in Płock, in 1812 got 4° (Elected Knight) along with the positions of an active member and the 1st warden of German-language works and editor of Polish-language works of this lodge, an active membership of the higher-degree [[Scottish Rite|Old-Scottish]] Lower Capitular Lodge ''Leopoldine zur Abendsonne'' (Leopoldine under the Setting Sun) later transformed into a Polish-language lodge ''Leopoldyna'' (Leopoldine) in Płock, positions of an active member of the [[Scottish Rite|Old-Scottish]] Directorate and a great archivist of the Provincial Lodge in Płock, in 1816 was appointed a Steward of the [[:pl:Wielki Wschód Narodowy Polski|Grand National Orient of Poland (WWNP)]] personally by the 1812–1821 Grand Master was the 1809–1813 both President of the State Council and [[List of Prime Ministers of Poland|Prime Minister]] of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] as well as the 1818–1821 [[:pl:Marszałkowie Senatu Rzeczypospolitej|Marshal of the Senate]] of the [[Congress Poland]] Count [[Stanisław Kostka Potocki]] known for his anti-clerical treatise ''[[:pl:Podróż do Ciemnogrodu|Podróż do Ciemnogrodu]]'' (Journey to the Bigotry Land) and the project of abolition of religious orders in the Congress Poland which finished his governmental career in 1820, in 1819 got 4° and active membership of the Lower Capitular Lodge ''Ludzkość'' (Humanity) in Płock which continued the Leopoldine under the [[:pl:Wielki Wschód Narodowy Polski|WWNP]], an honorary membership of the Grand Capitular Lodge-Mother ''Szczere Połączenie'' (Sincere Connection) on the East of Płock, became the plenipotentiary deputy of the Saint John's German-language Symbolic Lodge ''Dreieck'' (Triangle) in Płock to the [[:pl:Wielki Wschód Narodowy Polski|WWNP]] in Warsaw, got 6° (Knight of East) and an active membership of the [[:pl:Wielki Wschód Narodowy Polski|WWNP]]'s Saint John's Symbolic Lodge ''Kazimierz Wielki'' (Casimir the Great) in Warsaw, in 1820 got 4° and an honorary membership of the Saint John's Symbolic Lodge ''Doskonałość'' (Excellence) in Płock which continued the Albertine of Excellence under the [[:pl:Wielki Wschód Narodowy Polski|WWNP]] and co-organized the [[:pl:Towarzystwo Naukowe Płockie|Płock Scientific Society]], an honorary membership of the Triangle to which he was a plenipotentiary representative in the [[:pl:Wielki Wschód Narodowy Polski|WWNP]], an active membership of the Humanity and the Sincere Connection, and continued in the Casimir the Great as an active member with 6°, in 1821 became an [[Scottish Rite|Old-Scottish master]] of the Humanity and an honorary member of the Sincere Connection, the Triangle, and the Excellence.

Zofia Zdziarska had five siblings: oldest brother Bolesław Jr. was a political activist of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (SDKPiL) in Płock and Warszawa, third brother Wiesław was an engineer who emigrated to London, fourth brother Zdzisław was an economist and writer who participated in the [[Silesian Uprisings|3rd Silesian Uprising]], the only sister Janina Brewińska was a Warsaw dentist. Her second brother an [[Interwar period]]'s communist Mirosław Paweł Zdziarski (1892–1937) was a publicist and activist of the Polish workers' movement. In September 1902, he started secondary education at the Governorate Gymnasium in Płock with Russian teaching language and old police-like restrictions against any symptoms of Polish patriotism, while yet in March 1902 the school experienced the loud student protests against humiliation of their patriotic feelings and his older brother Bolesław Jr. who at this time was also a student therein informed him of the circumstances. In 1905, the school experienced a student strike action, on 6 February the students forcefully broke the resistance of their teachers and the anti-[[Russification of Poles during the Partitions|Russification]] petition was read loudly and given to the headmaster, while the school's students run to other schools in Płock to gain more supporters among students. This demonstration was with active and direct participation of Bolesław Jr. and Mirosław, and, moreover, the future activists of the Polish and international workers' movement such like [[Julian Leszczyński]]-Leński who became the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS) and [[:pl:Władysław Figielski|Władysław Figielski]] who became the chairman of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the composition of the [[Soviet Union]]. All the students were removed from the school, whereas the brothers Zdziarski not only lost the high scholarship established by Tokarski's widow Józefata née Wyrzykowska to his relatives but also never came back to the Russified school and were placed before the [[Justice of the peace|court of peace]] by the Tsarist police, but the judge declined to make a trial and sent the boys to home. In 1906, Mirosław was accepted to the then newly formed present-day [[:pl:Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Władysława Jagiełły w Płocku|Władysław Jagiełło High School in Płock]], which named the Polish Gymnasium of the Polish Educational Society was a non-governmental school with Polish teaching language, lack of restrictions, and good scholarships for the best students, and the headmaster Józef Szczepański who authored handbooks in mathematics. Since 1906 Bolesław Jr. worked with Leszczyński-Leński and Figielski in the Płock branch of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|SDKPiL]], while Mirosław joined first the Union of Progressive Youth, which grouped the school youth of the Congress Poland and was primarily led by Leszczyński-Leński, and, since the end of 1907 when he was almost 16 years old, also the Płock branch of the [[Polish Socialist Party – Left|PPS–Left]] known as the Young Faction of the [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]] and formed in 1906 at the 9th Party Congress in [[Vienna]], to which he was a member of the local committee in 1908–1910. In 1909, Mirosław was a delegate of the Union of Progressive Youth and participated in its Warsaw Congress, where together with all participants he was detained and arrested for three months by the Tsarist police. In May 1910 he matriculated, and, since certifications of the Polish-language schools were not recognized by the higher education system of the Russian Empire, he came to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and joined the [[University of Lviv|Francis Joseph University in Lvov]] to study history at the Philosophical Faculty and continued his activity at the foreign section of the [[Polish Socialist Party – Left|PPS–Left]]. In 1912 he travelled to the Congress Poland to make a secret job for the party and was detained and imprisoned in [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]]'s prison until 1914, when was sentenced to 2 years and 8 months of [[katorga]], life settlement in [[Siberia]], and life revocation of all rights. Soon after the outbreak of the [[World War I]], in September 1914, he forcefully displaced by train into the depths of the [[Russian Empire]] to the city of [[Irkutsk]], and was located in the penal colony for political prisoners, while his hometown was annexed by the [[Prussian Army|Royal Prussian Army]]. He began to earn as a tutor, married his pupil Zenaida Kondrashev, worked for the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], then primarily under a Russian economist [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]], and in 1916 the couple relocated to the modern-day [[Novosibirsk]], until 1926 named [[Novonikolaevsk]], where in 1917 during the [[February Revolution]], which started the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Russian Revolution]] against the [[Tsarist autocracy]], he was elected a delegate to the [[Workers' council]].

In March 1917 the couple came to Moscow, where both worked in the [[State Historical Museum|Historical Museum]], and Mirosław actively participated in formation of the Moscow branch of the [[Polish Socialist Party – Left|PPS–Left]] to which he was an executive member from May 1917 to July 1918. After the outbreak of the 1917 [[October Revolution]], the second and final part of the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Russian Revolution]], the couple was involved into the organization of the coup d'état instead of a military service, and, since November, Mirosław was the secretary of the government of the Petrograd region of Moscow. After Tsarism was abolished by [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], he organized and directed the Polish Commissariat in the [[Moscow region]], and continued the work for the Historical Museum where he found abundant documentation on the advanced activities of the [[Okhrana|Tsarist political police Okhrana]] in the Congress Poland. After he made hearings of few former Tsarist policemen in Warsaw and Płock, he wrote a booklet on the Tsarist provocations in the Congress Poland, and, on the basis of statistical data, proved that the activities of the many-year paid provocateurs who serviced to the Tsarist police were carefully organized and contributed substantial damages on the body of Polish workers' movement. Soon after in 1918 his work was published in [[Petrograd]] by the [[:pl:Komisariat do Spraw Polskich|Commissariat of Polish Affairs]] of the [[People's Commissariat for Nationalities]], the so-called 'three for the Polish affairs' the [[Cheka|Director of the Cheka]] [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], a Polish [[Szlachta|aristocrat]]-turned-[[communist]] born Feliks Dzierżyński and nicknamed Iron Felix, along with two Polish communist activists [[Julian Marchlewski]] and [[Feliks Kon]] ordered him to return the [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] for the party work, while his wife at this time already worked for the office of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Sovnarkom), then newly formed to transform the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] into the [[Soviet Union]] to which Poland was planned to be joined as the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Polish Soviet Socialist Republic]] due to the activity of the short living [[Polish Provisional Revolutionary Committee]] formed in [[Białystok]] in 1920 with the head Julian Marchlewski and a member Feliks Kon. In July 1918, the couple came to Poland, and, after a German soldier detained Mirosław at the railway station in Warsaw, he was imprisoned first in the [[Warsaw Citadel]] and then in the [[Modlin (Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki)|Modlin]]'s [[Internment Camp]], to escape from the prison in November 1918 and come to his family in [[Zdziar Wielki]] for a shelter. After the Royal Prussian Army was disarmed and on [[National Independence Day (Poland)|11 November 1918]] the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council of the Congress Poland]] appointed [[Józef Piłsudski]] the [[Commander-in-chief]] and the [[Chief of State (Poland)|Chief of State of the Second Polish Republic]] to create [[:pl:Rząd Jędrzeja Moraczewskiego|the first national government]] – the [[Provisional People's Government of the Republic of Poland]] – under a former member of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council (Reichsrat) of the Austro-Hungarian Empire]] [[Jędrzej Moraczewski]], after visits in Płock and Włocławek to give public [[political speech]]es Mirosław came to Warsaw to meet his wife and to work for the Warsaw branch of the [[Polish Socialist Party – Left|PPS–Left]] for which already on 16 December 1918 he was a delegate in the Warsaw Unifying Congress where the [[Polish Socialist Party – Left|PPS–Left]] and the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|SDKPiL]] married and created the [[Communist Party of Poland]] (KPP) with an essential assistance of Dzerzhinsky and Marchlewski. After this Congress finished, he worked as an editorial board member to the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]]'s central press organ ''[[Sztandar Socjalizmu]]'' (The Banner of Socialism) and for the editorial board of its illegal organ ''Czerwony Sztandar'' (The Red Banner). Zenaida focused on the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]]'s youth organization, while, in the aftermath of Piłsudski's official legalization of trade unions on 8 February 1919, he organized Polish trade unions of whose the pioneering Central Commission of Class Trade Unions (KCKZZ) was formed on 12 July 1919 under Piłsudski's critic and the [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]]' member [[Zygmunt Żuławski]], and with Mirosław as the deputy of the KCKZZ's secretary and the [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]]' member [[Antoni Zdanowski]] and the treasurer of the Executive Department of the KCKZZ until May 1920 when the 1st Congress of the Class Trade Unions in Warsaw transformed KCKZZ into the [[:pl:Związek Stowarzyszeń Zawodowych|Central Commission of Trade Unions (ZSZ)]] and Mirosław became its member. In the aftermath of the [[Polish–Soviet War|1919–1921 Polish–Soviet War]], in 1920 communist activists were massively arrested in Poland, and, among others, Mirosław was detained in June and imprisoned once again in the [[Warsaw Citadel]], where he stayed when the [[Red Army]] troops came onto [[Warsaw]]. Soon later, he was displaced first to the [[Wronki Prison]] and then to the [[:pl:Obozy internowanych żołnierzy armii URL w Polsce|Kraków-Dąb internment camp (1918–1921)]], from which he escaped in October 1920 to be arrested nine days later in the aftermath of his public political speech presented during the [[Polish Socialist Party – Left|PPS–Left]] rally in the city of [[Będzin]], the present-day [[Silesian Voivodeship]]. In May 1921, he was released from prison and came back to his wife in Warsaw, continued learning at the [[Warsaw School of Economics]], where he started the study yet in October 1919 and completed education in May 1923, and also returned to his favourite work for the trade unions, which he sought as the fight for better living conditions of the working class, to be the secretary of the Professional Faculty of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]]. Zenaida stayed in Warsaw, where she studied under a famous Polish actor [[Aleksander Zelwerowicz]] at the Drama School of the [[Warsaw Conservatory]], while her husband left Poland for the Soviet Union created on [[Creation of the Soviet Union|30 December 1922]], where already in September–October 1923 represented the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]] as a member at the 2nd Party Congress in Moscow, accompanied by [[Julian Leszczyński|Leszczyński-Leński]], which accepted the theses promoted by long time in Mirosław's articles.

On 13 May 1925, Mirosław was the chairman of the 1st National Conference of the [[Young Communist League of Poland]] as a delegate of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]], and during his public speech therein was arrested along with all participants and placed in the General Police Headquarters on the [[Aleje Jerozolimskie|Jerusalem Avenue]] in Warsaw to escape at night. In early 1924, he relocated to Lwów where under the pseudonym ''Józef Celiński'' was a member of the management of the [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine]] (KPZU), particularly in 1925 was a delegate of this party at both the 2nd KPZU Congress and the 4th [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]] Congress in Moscow, and authored the propaganda pamphlets under the pseudonym ''M. Gozdawa''. His wife relocated in the vicinity of [[Zakopane]] and worked for the [[Wojciech Bogusławski]] [[:pl:Teatr im. Wojciecha Bogusławskiego w Kaliszu|Theatre in Kalisz]], and soon later found a job in the press office of the Soviet Union's Embassy in Warsaw. After the conferences in Moscow, Mirosław returned to Warsaw to visit his brother Bolesław Jr. in hospital and come with wife to a theatre, but, although he attempted to escape, he was detained and placed in the [[Pawiak]] investigative prison when the [[May Coup (Poland)|1926 May Coup d'État]] occurred under [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski]]'s leadership and abolished the President [[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] and the government of the Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]] for absence of the Polish side in the [[Locarno Treaties|1925 Locarno Treaties]] with the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1926)|1926 Treaty of Berlin]] with the Soviet Union, to make Piłsudski's loyals a Lvov mathematician [[Kazimierz Bartel]] the [[List of Prime Ministers of Poland|Prime Minister of Poland]] and a writer [[Maciej Rataj]] the Acting [[List of heads of state of Poland|President of Poland]], before Piłsudski was appointed the Prime Minister in October 1926 while a chemist [[Ignacy Mościcki]] became the last President of the Second Polish Republic in June 1926 before the outbreak of the [[World War II]] in September 1939 and exile of his government to then neutral [[Kingdom of Romania]] where Mościcki was almost immediately interned and forced by France to resign. Under the charges of active involvement into the shooting of a paid provocator of the [[Second Department of Polish General Staff|Polish secret police ''Defensive'']] Józef Cechnowski by a Polish-Jewish member of the [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine|KPZU]] [[Naftali Botwin|Izaak Naftali Botwin]] on 29 July 1925 in the court of [[Lviv]], he was trailed and sentenced for 4 years of imprisonment at a heavy prison, where Bolesław Jr. visited him few times to be instructed how to organize his release with a help of higher state authorities, including former Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Education [[:pl:Antoni Sujkowski|Antoni Sujkowski]], but before these efforts came into effect his escape was organized by the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]] and Zenaida. During the escape Mirosław broke both ankles, and, after few months of a secret medical treatment, with a limited mobility the party comrades secretly transported him and Zenaida to Moscow, he shortly continued the cure at the [[Crimea]], but abandoned the idea of surgical operations and used a walking stick. In Moscow he worked for the Polish-language communist press, among others the [[:pl:Trybuna Radziecka|''Trybuna Radziecka'']] (The Soviet Tribune) for 1927–1930 and ''Myśl Bolszewicka'' (The [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevist]] Thought) for 1928–1929, during the 4th [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]] Congress in 1927 in Moscow he was elected a deputy member of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]], while during the 5th [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]] Congress in August 1930 in the [[Peterhof Palace]] near Leningrad he criticized himself in the aftermath of the overwhelming criticism of the majority's views expressed by the Congress' deputies. Furthermore, he worked for the [[Profintern|Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern)]] as an editor of the organization's press, the worker of its General Council, a member of its Executive Committee, and a collaborator of its general secretary [[Solomon Lozovsky]]. Also, in 1930–1937, he lectured at the Institute of Economic Sciences in Moscow, where on 10 June 1937 he was arrested after he finished a lecture.

In the course of the [[Great Purge|1936–1938 Great Purge]] executed on the command of the General Secretary of the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)]] (VKP(b)) [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[Genocide of Poles in the Soviet Union (1937–1938)]], the largest [[National operations of the NKVD|national operation of the NKVD]] with around 140,000 arrests and more than 111,000 executions nicknamed the ''Polish Operation'' and implemented on the basis of the [[NKVD Order No. 00485]] signed by the then head of the [[People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs]] (NKVD) [[Nikolai Yezhov]], took place, and, in particular, Mirosław after a brutal investigation and fabricated trial under the charges of membership in the [[Polish Military Organisation]] was executed by a shoot in [[occipital bone]] and buried in a [[Mass graves from Soviet mass executions|Soviet mass grave]]. Mirosław and Zinaida had a daughter, she probably died during the [[Siege of Leningrad|1941–1944 Siege of Leningrad]] in the course of the [[Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union 'Operation Barbarossa']], while Zinaida came back to the [[communist Poland]] where she died in 1957. In 1938, the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International|Executive Committee]] of the [[Third International (Comintern)]], known as the ECCI, in Moscow chaired by a Bulgarian communist [[Georgi Dimitrov]], who extended [[Leninism]] to make the most reactionary elements of [[financial capitalism]] the dictators of fascism, charged the [[interwar Poland]]'s communist parties – the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]], the [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine|KPZU]], and, moreover, the [[Communist Party of Western Belorussia]] (KPZB) – of being lead by '[[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|fascist agents]]' and disbanded them, almost all the parties' members who at the time stayed in the Soviet Union were repressed, many activists who remained in Poland were repressed in the aftermath of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|1939 Soviet invasion of Poland]] as a part of the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|1939–1944 Nazi–Soviet occupation of Poland]] due to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939]] whose [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|primary origins]] are dated back in 1918 when the [[Bolshevist Russia]] lost the [[Congress Poland]] in the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Russian Revolution]] and the [[Peace of Riga|1921 Peace of Riga]] which ended the [[Polish–Soviet War|1919–1921 Polish-Soviet War]] and established the interwar Polish-Soviet borders. In the 1950s the political climate in the Soviet Union changed – [[Generalissimus of the Soviet Union|Generalissimus]] [[Stalin's death|Stalin died]] in March 1953, [[Lieutenant General]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] was appointed the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee of the]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), Stalin's closest associate the [[NKVD]] chief [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Lavrentiy Beria]] along with 20 of 24 his close associates named ''Beria's gangs'' were sentenced to [[execution by firing squad]] in 1953–1956'','' the [[Khrushchev Thaw|1956 Khrushchev Thaw]] started with Khrushchev's 'secret speech' [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]] (1956) to a closed session of the [[20th Party Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] in February 1956 wherein both the worship of Stalin and his criminal system called [[Stalinism]] along with deportations to [[gulag]]s were officially condemned as a violation of [[Leninism]] to initiate [[de-Stalinization]], and, moreover, Stalin's loyal [[NKVD]] agent the then chairman of the [[Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party|Central Committee (KC) of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR)]] and [[List of Prime Ministers of Poland|Prime Minister of Poland]] [[Bolesław Bierut]] suddenly died in Moscow in two weeks after he was a guest to the [[20th Congress of the CPSU]] and was [[hospitalized]] in the clinic for the CPSU members. Due to the [[Poznań 1956 protests|June 1956 protests in Poznań]] done against working conditions, living standards, and the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|1945–1989 Soviet occupation of Poland]], brutally pacified with a help of 10,000 soldiers and 360 tanks by the order by the [[List of Ministers of National Defence of Poland|Minister of Defence]] and Deputy Prime Minister in [[:pl:Rząd Bolesława Bieruta i Józefa Cyrankiewicza|Bierut's cabinet (1952–1954)]] [[List of Marshals of Poland|Marshal of Poland]] and [[List of Marshals of the Soviet Union|Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] and command of the Polish officers under the Soviet generals, the [[Stalinism in Poland|1948–1956 Stalinist era in the history of Poland]] finished by the [[Gomułka Thaw|1956 Gomułka Thaw]] started in the aftermath of the 8th Plenum of the [[Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party|KC PZPR]] which until 1970 gave the post of ''de facto'' [[List of heads of state of Poland|Polish head of state]] the [[:pl:I sekretarze KC PZPR|First Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party|KC PZPR]] to [[Władysław Gomułka]], a many-year [[:pl:Kategoria:Więźniowie polityczni w Polsce Ludowej 1944–1956|Polish communist political prisoner]] and a former member of the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]] who in 1941–1942 was a member of Stalin's [[VKP(b)]] and in 1942 under the pseudonym ''Wiesław'' on Stalin's command co-installed in the occupied Poland the [[Polish Workers' Party]] (PPR) to be abolished for opposing the Soviet involvement in the Polish internal affairs, that is the so-called '[[rightist-nationalist deviation]]', in August–September 1948 by [[Bolesław Bierut|Bierut]] who in December 1948 joined the [[Polish Workers' Party|PPR]] and the [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]] to create the [[PZPR]]. Against the vote of [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|Rokossovsky]] as a member of the KC PZPR and thanks to Bierut's short-time successor [[Edward Ochab]]'s speech on 6 April 1956, his efforts at the 7th Plenum of the [[Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party|KC PZPR]] in July 1956, and instigation on 21 October 1956, with the support of the Prime Minister [[Józef Cyrankiewicz]], who in 1935 was the secretary of the Kraków branch of the [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]] and in 1942–1944 was imprisoned in the [[Nazi concentration camps]] in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] to lead [[:pl:Pierwszy rząd Józefa Cyrankiewicza|the cabinet 1947–1952]] and be reduced to the deputy Prime Minister's role in [[:pl:Rząd Bolesława Bieruta i Józefa Cyrankiewicza|Bierut's cabinet (1952–1954)]], Gomułka was rehabilitated along with the members of ''Gomułka's group'' which was ousted from power in September 1948 and included general [[Marian Spychalski]], both them were arrested in 1951 on Bierut's command by interrogator of the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland]] (MBP) [[Polish Armed Forces rank insignia|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Józef Światło]] nicknamed ''the Butcher'' whose defection to the United States military mission in the [[West Berlin]] in 1953 and further work for the [[Radio Free Europe]] were the causes to abolish the MBP in December 1954, who next was appointed the [[List of Ministers of National Defence of Poland|Minister of National Defence]] to [[:pl:Drugi rząd Józefa Cyrankiewicza|Cyrankiewicz's second cabinet (1957–1961)]], the [[Marshal of Poland]] in 1963, the President of the [[Front of National Unity]] in 1968–1971, and the ''de facto'' [[List of heads of state of Poland|Polish head of state]] Chairman of the [[Polish Council of State|Council of State]] in 1968–1970 when Cyrankiewicz replaced him on this post for 1970–1972 and Gomułka's political power finished in the aftermath of the [[1968 Polish political crisis|March 1968 Polish political crisis]], the cause of '[[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]]' [[Political Propaganda]] developed as a result of the Soviet bloc's frustration with the outcome of the Arab-Israeli [[Six-Day War|1967 Six-Day War]] which was doctrinally interpreted as an Israeli aggression and transformed into the [[anti-Semitic]] campaign to force emigration of the majority of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] with the support even in Gomułka's wife [[Zofia Gomułkowa]] who was born in an [[Orthodox Jewish]] family and together with her husband was arrested and imprisoned in 1951, his support to the 1960s' persecutions of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Poland]] and the Catholic intellectuals, and, moreover, his support to the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] to end the [[Prague Spring|1968 Prague Spring]] in August 1968 justified as the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] on 13 November 1968 during the 5th Congress of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]] by the then [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|Soviet leader]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]], who in 1964 together with [[Alexei Kosygin]] led the removal of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] by his disregard of many high-ranking organizations within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] and the Soviet government and who created the own cult of personality condemned in 1982 along with full legacy of his '[[Era of Stagnation|''Era of Stagnation'']]' by the last [[Soviet leader]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to justify the [[liberalisation]] reforms ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (reconstruction) which led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] on 26 December 1991.

The remarkable internationally renowned figure of the 1968 political emigration among the Polish intellectuals was an orthodox [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Leszek Kołakowski]] who first in March 1950 participated in the student conspiracy at the University of Warsaw against his teacher [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] for his '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''purely political speeches of the nature clearly hostile to the socialism-creating Poland''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' which in 1951 deprived him of rights to lecture and conduct classes, in 1957–1968 was the head of the Chair of History of [[Modern philosophy]] of the University of Warsaw, as a member of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]] worked for the [[:pl:Instytut Kształcenia Kadr Naukowych|Institute of Academic Staff Education]] of the [[Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party|KC PZPR]] under its founding director a Polish-Jewish Marxist theorist [[Adam Schaff]], got full higher education in philosophy at the [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]], a member of the [[Communist Party of Poland|KPP]], the [[Polish Workers' Party|PPR]] and the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]], a full member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]], in the 1950s in written glorified Stalin without a critique and in 1950–1952 lectured Marxism-Leninism to among others the last leader of the communist Poland [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], in 1956–1968 the founding director of the [[Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences|Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the PAS]], since 1969 a member of the [[Club of Rome]], since 1989 the founding director of the [[:pl:Polskie Towarzystwo Współpracy z Klubem Rzymskim|Polish Association for The Club of Rome]], who by the 1968 anti-Zionist press campaign in Poland was removed from the [[Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party|KC PZPR]] and lacked influence on teaching philosophy in the communist Poland. Nevertheless, as a result of a strongly repulsive impression on [[Soviet communism|communism]] in the Soviet Union of the [[Stalinism|late Stalinism]] got by his official academic visit to Moscow in 1950, already in 1957 Kołakowski published in Poland a four-part critique of the [[Marxism–Leninism|Soviet dogmas of Marxism]], in 1965, together with a famous philosopher and logician [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] and his former doctoral student a sociologist and ethicist [[Maria Ossowska]] who in 1945–1948 was a teacher in ethics to Kołakowski at the [[University of Łódź]] to be banned from teaching sociology in 1952–1956 by the [[Communist Ideology]]'s opposition to '''bourgeois disciplines''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and be appointed the head of the Section of History and Theory of Morality at the [[Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences|Institute of Philosophy and Sociology]] of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]] for 1952–1962 to get along with Kotarbiński the [[communist Poland]]'s highest state academic award '[[:pl:Odznaka Nagrody Państwowej|Golden Badge of the 1st Degree State Award]]' in 1972, wrote an opinion on the concept of news used by the defenders of the anti-communist oppositioners a leader [[Jacek Kuroń]] and an academic historian [[Karol Modzelewski]] who both were members of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]] since respectively 1952 and 1957 to be expulsed in 1964 and charged of ''propagation of false news'' in their open letter to the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]] which criticized the party's political line, in 1966 was deprived of the membership of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]] after he gave a critical public lecture at the [[University of Warsaw]] on the 10th anniversary of the [[Polish October|1956 Polish October]], for participation in the events of the [[1968 Polish political crisis|March 1968 Polish political crisis]] he lost work at the University of Warsaw and was blocked in obtaining any academic post in Poland by depriving him of the rights of lecturing and publishing, was forced into exile where lectured at the [[McGill University]] in Montreal and the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] at [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to finally settle in England for work in 1972–1991 as a senior research fellow to the [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] of the [[University of Oxford]], in 1976–1978 by the extensive 'handbook' ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'' became famous for [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism of Marxism]] and [[Criticisms of Marxism|criticism of Marxism]], and ultimately rejected [[Marxism–Leninism]] in favour of his [[Humanism|humanist]] interpretation of [[Marx]] inspired by the interpretation due to a Hungarian philosopher and one of the founders of the [[Western Marxism]] [[György Lukács]], in 1991 was appointed a full member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]]. In contrary, Kołakowski's fellow student and the leader the anti-Tatarkiewicz conspiracy [[:pl:Henryk Holland|Henryk Holland]] in October 1950 – December 1953 was a doctoral student at the Department of Philosophy of the [[:pl:Instytut Kształcenia Kadr Naukowych|Institute of Academic Staff Education]] of the [[Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party|KC PZPR]], to become famous for the ideological fight against the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lwów–Warsaw school of thought]] which in 1952 included a brutal attack against the world view of its founding father [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] wherein he named his philosophy as ''extremely [[Obscurantism|obscurantist]], [[fideism|fideist]], and priestly'', in 1952–1955 was an assistant professor at the Department of History of Philosophy of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Warsaw, and later was an editor to the Polish edition of the collected works by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], since 1953 worked for the ideological section of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]]'s central press organ [[Trybuna Ludu]] (People's Tribune), in April 1956 called the PZPR for rehabilitation of [[Władysław Gomułka|Gomułka]] and later supported his reforms following the [[Polish October|1956 Polish October]], in 1958 completed a doctoral thesis under [[Adam Schaff]] to be employed at the Section of Sociology and History of Culture of the [[Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences|Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the PAS]]. Similarly to Kołakowski, other politicized academic figure of the communist Poland forced to emigration in 1968 was a sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]] who was born to a non-observant Polish-Jewish parents from [[Poznań]] and who in the Stalinist era was a member of the [[Polish Workers' Party|PPR]] since 1946 and under the pseudonym ''Semjon'' was a political officer in the rank of [[Polish Armed Forces rank insignia|Major]] at the [[Internal Security Corps]] (KBW) of the [[Polish People's Army]] to combat the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] and the [[Home Army]] in 1945–1953, while yet in January 1968 abandoned membership of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]] by the increasing political pressure due to the purge led by the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] leader of the hardliners faction of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]] and the [[Ministry of Interior and Administration (Poland)|Minister of Interior]] [[Polish Armed Forces rank insignia|Major General]] [[Mieczysław Moczar]] to loss the chair at the University of Warsaw in the climax of the [[March 1968 events]]. As a result of rehabilitation of [[Władysław Gomułka|Gomułka]] in 1956, [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|Rokossovsky]] came to Moscow to convince [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] to use military forces against Poland, but, because Gomułka negotiated with the Soviets, the attempt failed and Rokossovsky was forced by Gomułka to leave Poland under the societal pressure due to the subsequent riots. Despite that Bierut along with an NKVD secret agent Marshal of Poland [[Michał Rola-Żymierski]] in 1949 gave Rokossovsky the highest military rank of Marshal of Poland and the Polish citizenship for his co-Commandership of the [[1st Belorussian Front]] along with the [[Soviet Marshal]] [[Georgy Zhukov]] which by cooperation with the [[1st Ukrainian Front]] commanded by the [[Soviet Marshal]] [[Ivan Konev]], who together with Zhukov was instrumental in arrest and military trial of Beria to support Khrushchev, in the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive|1945 Vistula–Oder Offensive]] stamped the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|1945–1989 Soviet occupation of Poland]] by the so-called Soviet 'liberation' of Poland from the Nazi Germany, yet in late 1956 the double Marshal and the twice [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] returned to his Motherland where his former ranks and honours were totally restored, and, after [[Zhukov]] was removed from the post of the Defence Minister of the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the [[Anti-Party Group]] affair when he defended Khrushchev against replacement by then [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] Marshal [[Nikolai Bulganin]], he was appointed the Deputy Minister of Defence for November 1956 – June 1957, until October 1957 the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence, the Commander of the [[Transcaucasian Military District]] for October 1957 – January 1958, the Deputy Minister of Defence and the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence for January 1958 – April 1962, and the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence for April 1962 – August 1968. Meanwhile, yet in 1954 under Bierut, the [[Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party|KC PZPR]] created the Commission for the Affairs of Rehabilitated Persons, which, however, investigated and processed rehabilitation petitions slowly until June 1956 when the Rehabilitation Commission of the Ministry of Justice of the Polish People's Republic under [[Zofia Wasilkowska]] was established along with a special unit for [[treason]]s under the Office of the [[Public Prosecutor General (Poland)|Public Prosecutor General]] [[:pl:Marian Rybicki|Marian Rybicki]], and among the 86 persons rehabilitated in 1956 was just Mirosław Zdziarski.

&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''

This basic historical family background was the most fundamental element in the shaping of Andrzej Grzegorczyk's further both intellectual formation and professional academic career. In particular, this heritage laid the foundations of his philosophical system which was a specific [[apologetics]] which mixed the [[Christian theology|Christian doctrine]] with certain elements of the [[Communist Ideology]], the ecumenic approach towards both the [[Roman Catholic Church in Poland]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the manifestly friendly attitude to the Eastern European countries and their national philosophers, and problems in the social assimilation in the Western European countries which served him at most for short time visits. Furthermore, this historical basis which for sure was known to his parents and adopted by his mind in the course of growing and raising, was strongly confronted against his personal experiences of the [[World War II]], and strengthened by the impact due to his academic teachers and supervisors, both clerical and secular. In the [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]], on the one hand Grzegorczyk's academic roots were highly respected by the leading figures of the manifestly politically subordinated Polish Academy of Sciences as well as the related representatives of the Warsaw academia, whereas, on the other hand, the bold contribution to the politically correct history of both Soviet and Polish communism due to the Zdziarski family and the perfect Polish-Russian relations due to Tokarski was the cause for Grzegorczyk's informal political immunity with respect to the communist authorities and services, which was only consolidated by other essential contributions from his wife's family members. Despite that Grzegorczyk's noble origins which were openly unwelcome by the official Marxist doctrine of the [[bourgeois nationalism]] professed by the Polish communism, and, moreover, his controversial ideas for philosophy and education along with multiple support to anti-governmental activities among students could not be unnoticed by the academia and the state authorities, he had never been detained, arrested, interned, officially hired or expelled for political reasons, what confirms that the political protective umbrella based merely on his family's historical contribution has been well functioning for him and his family members and relatives in Poland of both communist and post-communist systems.

== Educational formation ==

During the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|1939–1944 Nazi–Soviet occupation of Poland]] in the course of the [[World War II]], Grzegorczyk was a voluntary member of the [[Home Army]], the dominant [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]] formed in February 1942 by the [[Union of Armed Struggle]] and other [[Polish partisans]] with allegiance to the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]] as the armed wing of the [[Polish Underground State]]. As an [[Insurgency|insurgent]] of the [[Warsaw uprising]] under the pseudonym ''Bułka'', he provided a voluntary military service in the rank of Shooter in the 2nd Platoon of the Company '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Harcerska''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' of the [[Home Army|AK]] [[List of military units in the Warsaw Uprising|Battalion 'Gustaw']] of the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Róg''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' Group of the Group '''Północ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' of the Home Army. As a result of [[:pl:Eksplozja „czołgu pułapki” na ulicy Kilińskiego w Warszawie|the explosion of the Nazi heavy remote-control demolition layer]] [[Borgward IV|Sonderkraftfahrzeug 301 Ausführung C Schwerer Ladungsträger Borgward B IV]] of the Panzer Abteilung (Funklenk) 302 on 13 August 1944 at the [[Jan Kiliński]] street in the [[Warsaw Old Town]], which took life of more than 300 Polish partisans and civilians, he was injured in legs and placed in a field hospital. Several days later he rejoined the division, but by the health condition he did not participate in the further fights and was forced to leave [[Warsaw]] on 31 August 1944 as a civilian in the evacuation by the city canals from the [[Warsaw Old Town]] to the [[Śródmieście, Warsaw|Warsaw Śródmieście]].

He got primary education at a private School of the Roman Catholic Educational Society ''Future'', the same as for other Warsaw Uprising's insurgent a Polish politician [[Władysław Bartoszewski]] who under the pseudonym ''Teofil'' served to the [[Bureau of Information and Propaganda]] of the Headquarters of the Home Army in the rank of [[Polish Armed Forces rank insignia|Corporal]] and in 1940–1941 was imprisoned in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Since 1938, Grzegorczyk had obtained the [[Education in Poland during World War II|Polish secondary underground education]] at the [[:pl:VI Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Tadeusza Reytana w Warszawie|6th Tadeusz Reytan Lyceum in Warsaw]] to be matriculated in May 1940 on the day of [[Battle of France|France's capitulation]]. In order to be saved from a [[forced displacement]] to the [[Nazi Germany]] for a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]], he started another education at a chemical high school and then, when the [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities allowed [[Vocational education|vocational secondary education]] in the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]], at a 3-year chemical school localized on the area of the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] where in 1942–1944 he was taught by the professors of this university. At the same time, he completed a clandestine higher education at two then secret Polish universities – in physics at the [[University of Warsaw]], where physics was taught by [[Czesław Białobrzeski]] and Leonard Sosnowski, and in philosophy at the [[University of the Western Lands]], where among others [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] had read to the students the parts of himself authored and then being created book ''O Szczęściu'' (Analysis of Happiness), whereas [[history of philosophy]] was lectured by his protégé a Polish-Jewish philosopher [[:pl:Mieczysław Milbrandt|Mieczysław Milbrandt]] who as an insurgent of the [[Warsaw uprising]] under the pseudonym ''Noemi'' since August 1944 during the assault on the [[Sejm]] in September 1944 lost a leg and died of the heavily injures in a field hospital. At the stage of higher education, Grzegorczyk was especially attracted to logic by a broadcast lecture on [[stoic logic]] by a logician and mathematician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], who served as the Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Education of the [[Second Polish Republic]] in the [[:pl:Rząd Ignacego Jana Paderewskiego|1919 government]] of a pianist and composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], led the development of a Polish curriculum which replaced the Russian–German–Austrian curricula of the [[Partitioned Poland]] and focused on the early acquisition of elementary both logic and mathematics, in 1923 was awarded the [[Commander (order)|Commander]]'s Cross with Star of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] by [[Stanisław Wojciechowski|President Stanisław Wojciechowski]], in 1922–1923 and 1931–1932 was a rector of the [[University of Warsaw]], in 1938 was awarded by doctor honoris causa title of the [[University of Münster|Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster]], and in May 1939 was elected a councillor of the [[:pl:Rada Miasta Lwowa (II Rzeczpospolita)|Council of the City of Lwów]] as a representative of the [[Camp of National Unity]] based in the [[Sanation]] movement.

Practical exercises in mathematical logic were provided by [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]]'s student [[:pl:Henryk Hiż|Henryk Hiż]], who in the late 1930s was a member of the anti-[[Sanation]] [[:pl:Klub Demokratyczny|Democratic Club]], as an insurgent of the Warsaw Uprising in the rank of [[Polish Armed Forces rank insignia|Second Lieutenant]] was imprisoned in a Nazi [[prisoner-of-war camp]] [[:pl:Oflag II D Gross-Born|Oflag II D Gross-Born (Grossborn-Westfalenhof)]], after liberation by the [[4th Infantry Division (Poland)|4th Infantry Division (Jan Kiliński)]] of the [[First Polish Army (1944–1945)|First Polish Army]] immigrated to the US, where in 1948 as Henry Thadeus Hiz got a doctoral degree at the [[Harvard University]] for a thesis ''An economical foundation for arithmetic'' supervised by a famous American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and worked for the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Logic was also lectured therein by a Roman Catholic priest and [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] [[:pl:Jan Salamucha|Jan Salamucha]] who was a student of logicians and philosophers [[Stanisław Leśniewski]] and [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], a medical orderly in the [[Polish–Soviet War|1919–1921 Polish–Soviet War]], an organizer of the [[Cracow Circle]] for the logico-methodological analysis of the [[traditional metaphysics]] and [[Thomism]] – especially formalization of [[Thomas Aquinas]]' proofs for [[existence of God]] – in 1934 along with a [[Dominican monk]] and philosopher [[Józef Maria Bocheński]] who in 1964–1966 was a rector of the [[University of Fribourg|Universität Freiburg]] in Switzerland, a [[Thomism|Thomist philosopher]] [[:pl:Jan Drewnowski (filozof)|Jan Franciszek Drewnowski]], and logician and philosopher [[:pl:Bolesław Sobociński|Bolesław Sobociński]], a member of the [[National Radical Camp (1934)|National Radical Camp]] along with Sobociński, a professor and the head of the Chair of [[Christian philosophy]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]] since 1938 after he completed habilitation in 1937 and doctoral degree in 1927 for the thesis on modal sentences in [[Aristotle]]'s logic, a prisoner of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] in 1939–1940 as a result of the Nazi operation ''[[Sonderaktion Krakau]]'' against the Jagiellonian University's professors, a [[Christian ministry]] chaplain to the [[National Armed Forces]] and the [[Polish Armed Forces|Home Army]] [[Sub-district IV of Ochota (of Armia Krajowa)|Sub-district IV of Warsaw Ochota]], an awardee of the [[Cross of Valour (Poland)|Cross of Valour]] and an insurgent of the [[Warsaw uprising]] under the pseudonym ''Jan'' who was brutally murdered in the aftermath of the fall of the last major resistance point known as the ''Reduta Wawelska'' (Wawelska Stronghold) during the [[Ochota massacre|August 1944's Warsaw Ochota massacre]] by the Russian [[Collaborationism|Nazis' collaborationists]] of the [[S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A.]] (Russian Liberation National Army) commanded in 1942–1944 by [[SS]]-[[Brigadeführer]] [[Bronislav Kaminski|Bronislav V. Kaminski]], a Polish-German Russian nicknamed the ''Ochota's butcher'' who served in the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War|1917–1922 Russian Civil War]] to be expelled from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] in 1935 and be arrested in 1937 during the [[Great Purge]] for both criticism of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Stalin's policy of farm collectivisation]] and work with Germans and Poles. Meanwhile, [[psychology]] was taught by a Catholic priest [[:pl:Piotr Chojnacki (duchowny)|Piotr Julian Chojnacki]], historian of philosophy and ethicist who in 1921 got a doctoral degree in philosophy from the [[University of Fribourg|Universität Freiburg]] in Switzerland for the critical thesis on the [[Marburg school|neo-Kantian Marburg school]]'s approach to both [[Kant's ethics|Immanuel Kant's ethics]] as well as socialist ethics and in 1927 got a [[docent]] degree for a psychologic-epistemological study of notions and ideas at the former Faculty of Catholic Theology of the [[University of Warsaw]] to become its dean for 1938–1939 along with heading the Chair of Christian Philosophy and a Full Professor in 1947, who in 1952–1955 lectured at the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]] (KUL), and since 1954, when both the Faculty of Catholic Theology of the [[University of Warsaw]] and the Theological Faculty of the [[Jagiellonian University in Kraków]] were dissolved and transformed into the Academy of Catholic Theology (ATK) which in 1999 was renamed to the [[Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw]], until retirement in 1964 he was the dean of the Faculty of Christian Philosophy of the ATK and the head of the Chair of Logic, General Methodology of Sciences and Epistemology. Furthermore, fine arts were lectured by a Polish [[art historian]] [[Michał Walicki|Michał Marian Walicki]], who worked at the Department of Polish Architecture of the [[Warsaw Technical University]] in 1929–1936 and at the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw]] in 1932–1939 and 1945–1949, was awarded by the Officer's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] in 1947 and in 1949 was arrested and imprisoned till 1953 on the grounds of both [[false accusation]]s and a [[False evidence|fabricated evidence]].

On the other hand, one of Grzegorczyk's underground teachers was a [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and [[Philosophy of culture|culture]] [[Bogdan Suchodolski]], a professor at the Chair of [[Pedagogy]] of the [[University of Lviv|Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów]] since 1938, a professor at the University of Warsaw in 1946–1970 and a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning|PAU]] since 1946, since 1952 a member and in 1965–1970 a deputy of scientific secretary and in 1969–1980 a member of the presidium of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]], in 1953–1973 the chairman of the Committee on [[Pedagogy|Education Studies]] of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]], the head of the [[Institute for the History of Science, Polish Academy of Sciences|Department of History of Science and Technology of the PAS]] for 1958–1974 and the founding director of the Institute of Pedagogical Sciences at the [[:pl:Wydział Pedagogiczny Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego|Faculty of Education of the University of Warsaw]] for 1958–1968, since 1968 a member of the [[Front of National Unity]] (FJN), in 1983 a member of its successor the [[Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth]] (PRON) created to demonstrate unity and support for the [[communist Poland]]'s both government and governing party [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) in the aftermath of the [[Martial law in Poland|1981–1983 martial law in Poland]] with a crucial role of a Polish centrist political party [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] and a [[Procommunism|pro-communist]] secular [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] organization [[PAX Association]] which in 1949 formed a publishing house [[:pl:Instytut Wydawniczy „Pax”|Instytut Wydawniczy "Pax"]], in 1985–1989 a member and a [[Marszałek senior|Senior Marshal]] of the [[:pl:Sejm PRL|communist Poland's Parliament]], in 1982–1989 the chairman of the National Council of Culture created by the martial law's main author [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], during more than four decades of the [[Polish People's Republic]] he was awarded by the crucial state decorations such like the Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]], the [[Order of the Builders of People's Poland]], the Medal of the [[National Education Commission]], and twice the 1st class [[Order of the Banner of Work]].

Similarly to another Polish mathematician [[Helena Rasiowa]] whose first unfinished master thesis in philosophy prepared under [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] burned with all house during the [[Warsaw uprising]], Grzegorczyk was able to complete his originally underground education only after the [[World War II]] finished. Already in 1945 at the [[:pl:Wydział Filozoficzny Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego|Philosophical Faculty]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków, supervised by a renowned philosopher of physics [[Zygmunt Zawirski|Zygmunt Michał Zawirski]] who in 1938–1939 was the Faculty's dean and in 1937 relocated to [[Kraków]] after uninterrupted nine years as the head of the Chair of Theory and Methodology of Sciences of the [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań]] and investigated the problems on the borderline of philosophy and physics, Grzegorczyk finished the first higher study by a magister degree in philosophy with the thesis ''The Ontology of Properties'', wherein with a help of Kotarbiński's [[reism]], also propagated by Henryk Hiż, in the formal version by [[Stanisław Leśniewski]], he successfully presented interpretation of Leśniewski's elementary ontology as a theory of higher logical types. Soon after graduation, he got a postgraduate scholarship targeted to the study logic and the foundations of mathematics at the University of Warsaw, and on 26 May 1950 by examinations in philosophy and chemistry he completed a doctoral degree in mathematics with the thesis ''On Topological Spaces in Topologies without Points'' supervised by a famous mathematician [[Andrzej Mostowski|Andrzej Stanisław Mostowski]], in 1954 awarded by Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] and in 1963 elected a real member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]], who after the [[World War II]] also supervised Rasiowa's both master and doctoral theses in logic and the foundations of mathematics.

All the aforementioned teachers, both underground and post-war, by their teaching style and general attitude very deeply impacted onto Grzegorczyk's youthful mind. In his later years, the influence was strictly reflected by his various life choices, individual mental features, overall academic career both inside and outside Poland, both style and methods of research and teaching work. What is much more fundamental for his creativity, this impact straightforwardly shaped his personal [[world view]] which paradoxically mixed the ideas being in a deep mutual opposition, and resulted in the creation of a borderline philosophical system based on discrimination against the features of a human mind which are either inborn or beyond a personal choice.

==Academic career==

In 1946–1948, he was an assistant to [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], and, since at this time Tatarkiewicz was the editor-in-chief of the first Polish philosophical journal ''[[:pl:Przegląd Filozoficzny|Przegląd Filozoficzny]]'' (Philosophical Review), he served also as the secretary of the [[editorial board]]. In 1948, he submitted a paper on the semantics of descriptive language to the 10th [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in Amsterdam, but, similarly to most Polish philosophers invited by the organizers or submitting papers, he did not get passport and could not participate in this event, although his abstract was included in the proceedings. This fact was the omen of a difficult political time, and at this time logic focused attention of many Polish philosophers, young Grzegorczyk selected the way of majority. Soon after completion of the doctoral degree, he was employed by the [[:pl:Instytut Matematyczny PAN|Institute of Mathematics]] of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]] and after 3 years he completed qualification procedure to a [[docent]] position on the basis of a book ''Some Classes of Recursive Functions'', what at this time was an equivalent of the [[habilitation]] procedure. In 1950–1968, he worked at a secondary employment for the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw, in 1957 he was awarded by the [[:pl:Nagroda im. Stefana Banacha|Stefan Banach Prize]] of the [[Polish Mathematical Society]], in 1961 he was appointed an associate professor of mathematics. In 1963, along with [[Andrzej Mostowski]] and [[Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski]], he participated in the famous logical conference ''The Theory of Models'' at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where he met [[Alfred Tarski]] and where his both individual research results and research results co-authored with Mostowski and Ryll-Nardzewski were the subjects of few lectures. When a famous Dutch logician [[Evert Willem Beth]] died in 1964, the [[University of Amsterdam]] offered him the position of the head of the chair after Beth, he came to [[Amsterdam]] for few months and returned to Warsaw because he could not find a mental place for himself in the Netherlands, at this time on the eve of the cultural revolution which made Amsterdam the [[History of Amsterdam|'magic centre' of Europe]]. Also in 1967 he lectured four months at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and was appointed a member and an assessor to the Division of [[Logic]], [[Methodology of science|Methodology]] and [[Philosophy of science]] and [[Philosophy of technology|Technology]] of the [[International Union of History and Philosophy of Science]], while in 1970 he lectured two months at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. In 1960, he contributed a philosophical essay to the [[festschrift]] volume to honor [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] on the occasion of his 70th birthday anniversary, whereas his father contributed Tatarkiewicz's bibliography to this volume. In the aftermath of the [[1968 Polish political crisis|March 1968 Polish political crisis]], as a result of a long-lasting confirmed direct involvement into the anti-governmental oppositional actions such like signing every open letter against restriction onto [[freedoms]] under communist regime, the inconvenient political circumstances motivated him to leave the University of Warsaw for the Institute of Mathematics of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]], where, in the 1960s, he was appointed the head of the Department of Foundations of Mathematics after Andrzej Mostowski left this position and remained the head of the Chair of Foundations of Mathematics at the University of Warsaw. In 1972, he was appointed a Full Professor, in 1973 he organized the pioneering semester in mathematical logic at the [[:pl:Międzynarodowe Centrum Matematyczne imienia Stefana Banacha|Stefan Banach International Mathematical Center]] of the Institute of Mathematics of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]], also known as the Banach Center and formed in January 1972 by the mutual agreement between the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]] and the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences|Bulgarian]], [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences|Czechoslovak]], [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|East German]], [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Hungarian]], [[Romanian Academy|Romanian]], and [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR|Soviet]] [[National academy|national academies of sciences]], which started the 1973–1992 cyclic three-to-four-month long lectures and allowed both the logicians and philosophers of the isolated [[Eastern Bloc]] to interact with their Western colleagues. In 1974, by mutual agreement he left the Institute of Mathematics of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]] for the [[Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences|Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the PAS]] to work at the Section of Logic then headed by a [[Model theory|model theorist]] Ryszard Wójcicki who founded the series '''Trends in Logic''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and related conferences by the institute's oldest journal [[Studia Logica|''Studia Logica: An International Journal for Symbolic Logic'']], and to become the head of the Section of Ethics since 1982.

On the other hand, he was well known as an active member the [[Catholic Church in Poland|Roman Catholic Church in Poland]], in 1964 as one of the first [[Poles]] he appeared in the French commune [[Taizé, Saône-et-Loire|Taizé]], Saône-et-Loire, [[Burgundy]] to associate with an [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] Christian [[Monasticism|monastic]] group known as the [[Taizé Community]], and this visit initiated the systematic contacts of the Polish Catholic intellectuals with this ecumenic group. He was a member of the Warsaw branch of the [[Club of Catholic Intelligentsia]], particularly he was appointed a [[Deputy-president|deputy president]] in 1972–1973 and a member of the government in 1973–1974 and 1976–1978, formed in 1956 after the [[Gomułka's Thaw|Gomułka Thaw]] to stimulate independent thought and inform Polish Catholics on the [[Catholic philosophy]] in the countries outside the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Starting the 1970s, he practiced independent [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] activities, in particular the dialogue with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Poland for which he organized encounters between the Polish Catholic intellectuals the Russian Orthodox intellectuals at his own apartment, which in the late 1970s and the early 1980s was also the location for the lectures of the [[Flying University]] organized by the [[:pl:Towarzystwo Kursów Naukowych|Society of Scientific Courses (TKN)]]. His model of the Catholic-Orthodox ecumenism found a good realization in the collaboration with the Russian Orthodox priest [[Alexander Men|Alexander V. Men]] of Moscow, an eminent chaplain of independent Russian intellectuals who was murdered in 1990. He was a dedicated supporter of Russia and Ukraine, he felt that the Soviet Union was his second home, he actively collaborated with many Soviet and Russian scholars and claimed that [[Russians]] and [[Poles]] have a similar expression of the world and many in common by the culture. Among the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[Opposition (politics)|oppositionists]] in the Polish academia, he was well known as both supporter and propagator of the philosophy of [[nonviolence]], a fight without making use of any kind of violence, and as the spiritual masters he followed the teachings of the leader of Indian nationalism [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the leader in the [[civil rights movement]] [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] who got the 1964 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], as well as both [[:pl:Henryk Hiż|Henryk Hiż]] and his mentor [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], who in 1958–1968 was a deputy chairman to the All-Poland Committee of the [[Front of National Unity]] of the [[communist Poland]] under first [[Aleksander Zawadzki]] and then [[Edward Ochab]].

[[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic]] strictly blocked public information on Grzegorczyk, and, similarly to other Polish mathematician [[Stanisław Hartman]] of the [[University of Wrocław]] who got the Stefan Banach Prize in 1953, already in 1977 his name was enlisted for the strengthened control of the censorship. Every attempt of popularization of his name in the mass media (daily press, radio, TV, socio-political magazines) was immediately signalized to the directors of the central office of the state censorship directly controlled by the authorities of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|communist party]] which then governed Poland. The censorship rules made exception solely for the publications in the specialist press, academic journals, and university lecture notes. However, as compared to the aforementioned famous case of Hartman, he had never been involved into a real political activity, such like direct supporting of anti-governmental student protesters, membership in oppositionist organizations, membership in a political party. Hence, he almost completely smoothly came through the communist period of Polish statehood and avoided the various unpleasant circumstances produced by the state authorities and services against their ideological enemies in the Polish academia, which usually included regular persecutions and repressions by sudden often brutal hearings, firing from a university teacher's job, ban on public lectureship, forced political emigration, internment during the period 1981–1983 of the [[martial law in Poland]]. Similarly to Hartman, for his oppositionist activity he was "exiled" from his alma mater to the Institute of Mathematics of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]]. However, he always placed his personal intellectual development on the top priority, and made professional advancements both inside and outside the communist fatherland, particularly in 1979 he was elected a member of the [[:de:Institut International de Philosophie|International Institute of Philosophy (IIP)]] in Paris, France with respect to which he did not hide the critical views.

'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

After the pioneering [[Revolutions of 1989|Revolution of 1989]] in Poland, he was celebrated as an intellectual authority of the [[Post-communism|post-communist]] [[Republic of Poland]]. He was appointed a corresponding member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning|PAU]] in [[Kraków]] after its finally successful restoration in 1989, and an active member of the Section of Philosophy of the [[:pl:Towarzystwo Naukowe Katolickiego Uniwersytetu Lubelskiego Jana Pawła II|Scientific Society]] of the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|KUL]]. In 1990, he took an early retirement and enhanced his organizational activity for the Polish philosophical academia as a director of research grant ''The Hundred Years of the Lwów–Warsaw School'', within which there he organized a huge conference in Warsaw and [[Lviv|Lvov]] on the occasion of [[Kazimierz Twardowski]]'s centenary as the head of a chair at the former [[Jan Kazimierz University]] of Lwów, and translation of his book to Ukrainian language. In 1995, he was elected the chairman of the editorial board of the restored weekly [[:pl:Przegląd Filozoficzny|''Przegląd Filozoficzny'']]. In 1997, under the rationale '''for his outstanding merits to the [[Polish science and technology|Polish science]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski|President Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] awarded him by the Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]]. In 1999–2003, he was both the first ever honorary member and the chairman of the [[:pl:Komitet Nauk Filozoficznych PAN|Committee of Philosophical Sciences of the PAS]], the Polish state body responsible for coordination and giving opinions on philosophical activities as well as analysis of philosophical publications and teaching programs in Poland. In 2011–2014, he was a member of the Committee of Ethics in Science of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]] whose purpose is the diagnosis of ethical consciousness of Polish scientific community and recommendations for its improvements. In 2010, he was awarded by the honorary doctorate of the [[Blaise Pascal University]], [[Clermont-Ferrand]], France, whereas in 2013 he was awarded the honorary doctorate of the [[Jagiellonian University in Krakow|Jagiellonian University in Kraków]] [[Poland|.]] Finally, under the rationale ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'for his outstanding achievements in the scientific and didactic work, for his merits to the development of science and the activity for the democratic transformations in Poland''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' in 2014 [[Bronisław Komorowski|President Bronisław Komorowski]] posthumously decorated him by the Officer's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]].

==Legacy==
=== Mathematical logic and mathematics ===
Both inside and outside Poland he was most known for continuation of the [[Interwar period]]'s intellectual traditions of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]], in particular with the substantial help of Grzegorczyk and other [[Andrzej Mostowski]]'s student [[Helena Rasiowa]], as well as independently [[Alfred Tarski]]'s student [[Wanda Szmielew]], Warsaw rejoined the chart of the worldly foundational studies. He shared the view of Tarski and Mostowski that logical investigations should respect deductive sciences, in particular, mathematics, and was skeptical in the matter of a value of investigations, developed by Łukasiewicz's school, which looks for the shortest logical axioms or the simplest axiomatic bases of various logical systems. It is important to notice that a role of both Grzegorczyk and Rasiowa for earlier unpublished work in computable analysis by [[Stanisław Mazur]], a member of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] who was a member of communist Poland's Parliament in 1947–1956 and the director of the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Warsaw in 1964–1969 awarded by the Officer's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] in 1946, the Stefan Banach Prize in 1949, and the [[Order of the Banner of Work]] in 1951 and 1954, who investigated [[nonlinear functional analysis]] and [[Banach algebra]]s and who in 1936–1939 elaborated the concept of computable real numbers and functions along with [[Stefan Banach]]. It is well known that Mazur was unfortunate in extension of his pre-war work to general computable mathematical objects, and the results were successfully assembled and published only in 1963 just under edition of Grzegorczyk and Rasiowa, what had a comparatively small inﬂuence on development of computable analysis, but developed careers of both the editors at the University of Warsaw.

Among his achievements in logic, one can find the issues of computability and decidability such like [[Recursive function (computability)|recursive functions]], [[computable analysis]], [[Arithmetic|axiomatic arithmetic]], and [[Concatenation (mathematics)|concatenation]] theory. On the other hand, he made research in the system of logics such like [[logical axioms]], [[Foundations of geometry|axiomatic geometry]], [[non-classical logic]]s, and interpretations of logic where, in particular, he defended [[psychologism]] since the beginning of his research. His two famous articles of 1958 and 1961 co-authored with [[Andrzej Mostowski]] and [[Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski]] became the starting point for research in the axiomatic [[second-order arithmetic]] and the arithmetic with an infinite conclusion rule, in particular the 1958's paper introduces the [[second-order arithmetic]] formalized in the [[first-order logic]] wherein both numbers and [[number set]]s are taken into account. He contributed research of the fundamental importance for [[theoretical computer science]] and precursory for the [[computational complexity theory]], in 1953 he described and investigated classes of [[Recursive function (programming)|recursive functions]] generated by superposition, restricted recursion and the restricted minimum operation from some prescribed basic functions which contain addition and multiplication, and satisfy the condition that every class in question includes more complicated [[primitive recursive function]]s, and he got the sub-recursive hierarchy which ﬁlls the class of primitive recursive functions and is named the [[Grzegorczyk hierarchy]]. This originally recursion-theoretic hierarchy takes into account a [[strictly increasing]] [[infinite sequence]] of classes of functions of which the sum is a class of [[primitive recursive function]]s considered earlier, the n+1-th level functions are generated by iteration of the n-th level functions the number of times indicated by one of the arguments and by the closure under primitive recursion scheme [[bounded from above]] by an already deﬁned function.

In 1964–1968, he researched relational and topological [[semantics]] for the [[intuitionistic logic]], what in the context of the famous work due to [[J.C.C. McKinsey]] and [[Alfred Tarski]] was also a semantics for [[modal logic]]. Inspired by [[Paul Joseph Cohen]]’s notion of forcing and [[Evert Willem Beth]]'s semantics for intuitionistic logic, on the basis of the [[Heyting arithmetic]] and [[Stanisław Jaśkowski|Jaśkowski]]'s formulation of the intuitionistic [[propositional calculus]], he proposed the [[model theory]] for the intuitionistic logic of constant domains (CD) and found a modal formula which is valid in all [[partial order|partially ordered]] frames with descending chain condition but not in all [[topological space]]s. Because the logic resulting from this semantics includes the intuitionistically unprovable Grzegorczyk's schema &lt;math&gt;\forall x(A\or B(x))\rightarrow A\or \forall x B(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where x is not free in a sentence A, it is stronger than intuitionistic predicate logic. He proposed the semantics as a '''philosophically plausible formal interpretation of intuitionistic logic''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' independently of the near-contemporary work by an American philosopher and logician [[Saul Kripke|Saul Aaron Kripke]], observed that his semantics validates the schema and modified the forcing relation for disjunctions and existential formulas to give an exact interpretation for intuitionistic predicate logic. Sabine Koppelberg née Görnemann first in her doctoral dissertation of 1969 proved completeness of a calculus related to Grzegorczyk's semantics by both Kripke's tableau method and an algebraic method which made use of a language with the logical symbols (&lt;math&gt;\and, \or, \neg, \rightarrow, \exist, \forall&lt;/math&gt;), and then in 1971, with independent results by Dieter Klemke in 1970–1971 and [[Dov Gabbay]] in 1969, proved that addition of the scheme to intuitionistic predicate logic is suﬃcient to axiomatize Grzegorczyk's logic. Grzegorczyk's model theory has a ﬁxed constant domain and represents a static ontology, whereas Kripke's model theory involves a quasi-ordered set of classical models, where the domains can expand along the quasi-ordering, and represents an expanding ontology with new objects created in a growth of knowledge. In other words, Grzegorczyk's semantics for the intuitionistic predicate logic is the class of predicate Kripke's models which have constant domain function. From the point of view of [[non-classical logic]]s, with a help of the necessity operator &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt;, he proposed to consider &lt;math&gt;\Box(\Box(A \Rightarrow \Box A)\Rightarrow A)\Rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; what was later called the [[Grzegorczyk schema|Grzegorczyk formula/axiom]], which, although that is not valid in the [[Clarence Irving Lewis|Lewis]] [[normal modal logic]] S4, when added as a new axiom schema to S4, which can be equipped into the [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]], gives the intuitionistic logic which can be translated into the S4 calculus by virtue of [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s interpretation of an intuitionistic logic via provability operator. In particular, Krister Segerberg was the first who proposed for this emerging specific system of a modal logic the name [[Grzegorczyk's logic]] and the symbol S4Grz or S4.Grz, whereas [[George Boolos]] contributed the foundational investigation of [[Grzegorczyk's schema]] in the context of [[proof theory]] and [[arithmetic]].

In 2005, Grzegorczyk gave a new proof of the undecidability of the ﬁrst-order functional calculus without making use of Gödel's [[Arithmetization of analysis|arithmetization]], and, moreover, demonstrated undecidability of a simple [[concatenation theory]], the operations of matching two texts understood as sequences of symbols into one text with the next text being a continuation of the first one. Grzegorczyk's undecidability of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[concatenation theory]] is based on the philosophical motivation claiming that investigation of formal systems should be done with a help of operations on visually comprehensible objects, and the most natural element of this approach is the notion of text. On his research, Tarski's simple theory is undecidable although seems to be weaker than the weak arithmetic, whereas, instead of computability, he applies more epistemological notion of the effective recognizability of properties of a text and relationships between different texts. In 2011, Grzegorczyk introduced yet one more logical system, which today is known as the [[Grzegorczyk's non-Fregean logic|Grzegorczyk non-Fregean logic]] or the logic of descriptions (LD), to cover the basic features of descriptive equivalence of sentences, wherein he assumed that a human language is applied primarily to form descriptions of reality represented formally by logical connectives. According to this system, the logical language is equipped in at least four logical connectives [[negation]] (¬), [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] (∧), [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] (∨), and [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]] (≡). Furthermore, he defined this propositional logic from scratch, argued that neither classical propositional logic nor any of its non-classical extensions can be applied as an adequate formal language of descriptions, whereas the paradoxes of [[Material conditional|implication]] and equivalence are due to classical logic's ''restricting itself to considering only one, admittedly the most important, parameter of the content of a claim, namely its truth value''. He rejected all the [[Tautology (logic)|classical logical tautologies]] except [[Law of contradiction|the law of contradiction]] and added two [[logical axioms]]: (LD1): ≡ represents an equivalence relation and obeys the appropriate [[Extensionality]] property, that is equal descriptions can be substituted for each other, and (LD2): ≡ joins some of the Boolean properties of descriptions, such like [[Associative property|associativity]], [[Commutative property|commutativity]], and [[Idempotence|idempotency]] of ∧ and ∨, [[Distributive property|distributivity]] of ∧ over ∨, [[Distributive property|distributivity]] of ∨ over ∧, involution of ¬ that additionally satisﬁes the [[De Morgan's laws|De Morgan laws]]. His results in the concatenation theory and the propositional calculus with the descriptive equivalence connective provided an important addition to his signal achievements.

By his investigations in [[psychologism]], he converted the paradox of [[Eubulides]] into a positive theorem (formally proved): an ideal human tackling a linguistically properly stated problem is able to think on this consistently, sincerely and fully consciously. In opposition to [[Alfred Tarski]] and other anti-psychologist logicians who taught that the [[natural language]] leads to contradiction by its very nature, he rejected this conviction and proposed a formal system of the Universal Syntax which imitates the versatility of [[colloquial language]]. On his approach, the axiomatization of quotation-operator is the best device which allows to marry logic with [[metalogic]] and prove the adequacy theorem for the notion of truth. He dealt with the problem on invasion of logic by [[postmodernity]], because the deconstruction of logical rules is not at stake, there would be no logic, while the foundation of logic could be rocked. Despite that in the mathematical genealogy he was and a son of Andrzej Mostowski and a grandson of Alfred Tarski, he manifestly undermined and rebutted the classical [[anti-psychologism]] of modern logic. His best known logico-mathematical book is ''An Outline of Mathematical Logic: Fundamental Results and Notions Explained with All Details'' published in Polish in 1961 and in English in 1969. His book ''Fonctions Récursives'' became the standard handbook at the French universities''.'' His other book ''Zarys arytmetyki teoretycznej'' (An Outline of Theoretical Arithmetic) became the basis for the [[Mizar system]] by the [[University of Białystok]]'s team of a notable computer scientist [[Andrzej Trybulec]]. In Poland, Grzegorczyk was the first who popularized logical calculus by the book ''Logika popularna'' (Popular logic), also translated into Czech in 1957 and Russian in 1965, and the problems of decidability theory by the book ''Zagadnienia rozstrzygalności'' (Decidability problems).

He studied [[computable real number]]s, in particular provided few different definitions of these numbers and the ways to development of [[mathematical analysis]] based only on these numbers and computable functions determined on these numbers. He investigated computable functionals of higher types and proved undecidability of different weak theories such like elementary topological algebra, he considered [[axiomatic]] [[foundations of geometry]] by the means of [[solid geometry|solids]] instead of [[Point (geometry)|points]], he showed that [[mereology]] is equivalent to the [[Boolean algebras|Boolean algebra]], he approached [[intuitionistic logic]] with a help of semantics of intuitionistic propositional calculus built upon the notion of enforced recognition of sentences in the frames of cognitive procedures, what is similar to the [[Kripke semantics]] which was crated parallelly, and he studied [[Reism|Kotarbiński's reism]]. He proposed an interpretation of the [[Stanisław Leśniewski|Leśniewski ontology]] as the Boolean algebra without zero, and demonstrated the [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]] of the theory of the Boolean algebras with the operation of [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]]. He investigated [[intuitionistic logic]], just a modal interpretation of the [[Grzegorczyk's semantics|Grzegorczyk semantics]] for intuitionism, which predetermined the [[Kripke semantics]], leads to the aforementioned S4.Grz. He sought logic as a vivid area placed in the mainstream of the European philosophy, and, although that he belonged to rather hermetic [[Lwów-Warsaw school of logic|Lwów–Warsaw School]] of thought, in opposition to his intellectual masters and academic mentors he contributed the approach to logic by the means of psychology. For him, logic is a collection of principles which preserve the emphatic declarations of the majority of properly educated and free from either violation or corruption people, that is, he attributes logic to a perfect human mind formed as a result of ideal educational background, ideal upbringing process, and ideal propriety. On his idealist views, classical logic is a formal theory of existence [[lexicalized]] by the [[existential quantification]], and all that is logical is nothing but a text. As a fervent follower of the classical [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] attitude, he sought logic not only as the fundamental tool but also as the basic ontology wherein semantics dealing with human utterances is preceded by attributes of humankind such like rationality, life, and existence. In his methodological approach, logic lays the foundations of science and the overall European invention.

=== Philosophy and ethics ===
&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''

In the field of [[philosophical logic]] he defended the ontological interpretation of the logical laws, on the basis of his personal belief on describing the world by these laws. In a straightforward opposition to the teachings by the fathers-founders of the twentieth-century European [[transcendentalism]] a German logician [[Gottlob Frege]] and an Austrian phenomenologist [[Edmund Husserl]], thanks to which [[anti-psychologism]] also known as logical realism or logical objectivism dominated both the common understanding of logic and the formal reasoning in logic, he defended [[psychologism]] which he approached as a thesis about dependence of the relationship of meaning and determination on the human factor and its description attributed to a human behavior, what in itself was very far from [[continental philosophy]] and appropriate to an English [[Enlightment philosophers|Enlightement philosopher]] [[John Locke]] and a British [[Utilitarianism|utilitarianist philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]] who was criticized by [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] for the logical psychologism. According to Grzegorczyk's interpretation, any description is in a language of someone and done for someone, whereas logic is applied to describe the world strictly. As a result of such an approach, he produced the reinterpretation of the [[Antinomy|semantic antinomies]] which claims on limitations of applicability of concepts rather than self-contradiction of a language. Particularly, in the book ''Logic – a human affair'', by the style appropriate to Tarski, he discussed with [[anti-psychologism]] and presented the formal construction of the Universal Syntax which led him to the hypothesis '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''to say that a sentence A is true is equivalent to the statement of this sentence relativized to the domain wherein one applies the sentence A'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' which trivializes the notion of truth, but he also stated that '''the proof of this trivialization is trivial'.'' On his approach, the [[liar paradox]], which lays the foundations of this construction, transforms the [[antinomy]] into the hypothesis on both the human nature and human condition'': 'there is a problem about which a human can not think in an accordant, sincere, and fully conscious way, that is having full awareness of the recognized and unrecognized sentences''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. Hence, in his fervent battle for [[psychologism]], he linked formal logic to rather non-universal and subjective attributes of a human mind, and, moreover, claimed that [[Anti-psychologism|anti-psychologist]] interpretation of meaning is inspired by the related idealist vision of the world as formed by ideally formed intellectuals. According to Grzegorczyk, independently on personal motivations for which one makes considerations, the criterion of the value of these considerations is logic, strictly speaking if a proof is logical, systematic, and self-conscious. Grzegorczyk approached logic as the morality of speech and thought, he sought in logic the foundations of moral discussions, and, therefore, made a straightforward cultivation of discrimination fully appropriate to the [[German idealism|German idealists]] – he did not see a morality beyond a selected system and claimed the selected model of morality is the universal one. Despite that he conceived just logic by wide horizons, included the methodology of science into its foundations and claimed that logic is a basic component of the intellectual attitude which he identified with the [[European Rationalism]], he limited both logic by rationalism and rationalism by logic. His model of rationalism is open to the realm of values, acquirable for a reliable knowledge, and advocates ethics in social relations, whereas logic appears therein as a pure attribute of a human mind – a rational European human. He fought for psychologism in logic, for him semantic relations are always relations for someone and are mediated by language. Consequently, paradoxes demonstrate the limits of concepts and systems rather than inconsistencies of a language.
&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''

Furthermore, he contributed a series of writings in philosophical anthropology and ethics in the methodological framework of philosophy which he named ''rationalism open for values'', which was basically no more than a mixture of the Christian theology and the selected teachings of the [[Lwów-Warsaw school of logic|Lwów–Warsaw school]]'','' and for which he developed the selected ideas of the [[Marxist thought]] in the context of theology and philosophy''.'' The best example of the latter context is his book ''Mała propedeutyka filozofii naukowej'' (Short propedeutics of scientific philosophy) issued by the aforementioned [[Procommunist|pro-communist]] Catholic publisher [[:pl:Instytut Wydawniczy „Pax”|Instytut Wydawniczy "Pax"]] on the eve of the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Final decade of the Polish People's Republic (1980–90)|fall of communism in Poland]] in December 1989, when the Marxist-Leninist references were removed from the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|July 1952 Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]] and the country was renamed to the [[Republic of Poland]], the dissolution of the [[PZPR]] in late January 1990 by its last First Secretary [[Mieczysław Rakowski]] and the dissolution of the [[Warsaw Pact]] on 1 July 1991 in [[Prague]]. However, Grzegorczyk yet in his 1989's book fully and fervently developed the crucial ideas of the [[Marxist ideology]], where in particular the name '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''scientific philosophy''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' is not equal to [[philosophy of science]] understood as the standard philosophical discourse and is reserved to the unique significance of the ideological deformation of philosophy. The ideological misuses of the word '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''scientific''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' in the context of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxism-Leninism]] are well-known: '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''scientific world view''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' is equal to the Marxist world view, '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''scientific religion''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' is equal to the [[Marxist–Leninist atheism|Marxist-Leninist atheism]], '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''scientific art''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' is equal to [[socialist realism]] also known as socrealism, while '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''scientific philosophy''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' is simply the synonym of both [[dialectical materialism]] and [[historical materialism]] – just making use of the term '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''scientific''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' was making the ideology. Indeed, similarly to ecumenism between different religions, this book, which met a devastative criticism by the Roman Catholic clerical scholars such like a [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] [[Metaphysics|metaphysicist]] [[:pl:Andrzej Maryniarczyk|Andrzej Maryniarczyk]] of the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|KUL]], under the brightly banners of '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''pure philosophy''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''uniform approach to philosophy which can be the basis of teaching''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' proposed no more than an ideological uniformity of philosophy without a division onto the subjective branches such like [[Thomism]], [[Existentialism]] or [[Platonism]] in order to get the alleged advantage of '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''maximal objectivity''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' of philosophy, where Grzegorczyk approaches philosophy as merely a convention based on the alleged values such like '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''seriousness''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''sincerity''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' claimed by him as the determinants of quality of [[philosophizing]]. He did not give the explicit definitions of these alleged merits, but provided some crucial hints on what is ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'serious and sincere philosophy''&lt;nowiki/&gt;': the most general thoughts and insights concerning the world and human life, systematic cognitive activity leading to construction of a philosophical world view, the philosophical views of brilliant writers and even scholars of other disciplines who in the margins of their specialty sometimes made interesting general considerations, amateur general reflection on any topic, professional statements which give very systematic and well exhaustive reflection, texts printed in special philosophical journals, and teachings of university professors. He introduced three categories of philosophers: amateur, traditionalists and professionals, where the only latter one can be performed in the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''scientific''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' way, that is with a help of [[natural science]] and mathematics, but he did not make a difference between a speculation attributed to amateurs and a theoretical approach attributed to philosophy understood as an academic discipline, and, for this reason, made philosophy a part of the collectivist people's culture. The crucial element of his approach is the concept of reality divided onto observable reality formed by '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''objects (things) of different properties, joined by relations, creating different sets''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' by learning of which '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''we attribute certain properties to them and combine them into sets''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', and unobservable reality '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''composed of some separate things (...) with certain properties''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', where he attempted to apply his variant of [[dialectical materialism]] to justify an undefined materialistic [[spiritualism]] usually attributed to the [[Marxist-Leninist atheism]]. Comparatively, in his other book ''Życie jako wyzwanie'' (Life as a challenge), published already in 1993 when the primary socio-economic-political transformations were just implemented in the restored Republic of Poland almost free of the fallen Soviet occupation, he presented an unambiguously liberalized ontological declaration '''the world (...) contains objects (...) having various properties, connected by various relations, and belonging to various sets'.'' From a general philosophical point of view, this book resorted to all the basic notions such like good and evil as the links of the first semantic chain, that is the central ontological notion of an object with the notion of a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]], and his analysis went further precisely along the second ontological chain, that is towards the notions of case and act. In general, the whole book reflected its author's full both conformity with and loyalty towards the economic-political transition, started with the [[Polish presidential election, 1990|1990 Polish presidential election]] which made the leader of the anti-communist opposition and the 1983 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Lech Wałęsa]] the first freely elected President of the Third [[Republic of Poland]], although until [[Lustration in Poland|2007 Lustration in Poland]] the Polish state authorities did not require a political either purge or thaw or at least a humble self-criticism among the Polish academia, and, moreover, until 2005 the successors of the [[PZPR]] – the [[Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland]] (SdRP) in 1991 and the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD) in 1999 – governed by [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] who won the [[Polish presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential elections]] over [[Lech Wałęsa]] to be the 3rd President for 1995–2005 and to be instrumental in introduction of Poland into the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004 along with his party comrades [[Józef Oleksy]], [[Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz]], [[Leszek Miller]], and [[Marek Belka]], who were the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Ministers of Poland]] for 1995–1996, 1996–1997, 2001–2004, and 2004–2005 respectively.

In the matter of [[philosophical anthropology]], on the basis of the ways of reasoning pivotal for the development of the European philosophy, he provided the systematic analysis of mutual relationships between the forms of thinking and cognition in the context of the beginnings of the European culture, gave precise description of the phenomenon of European rationalism, where rational means successful as well as efficient and well-founded, through joining this concept to the internal flow of intellectual life of the European civilization and to a specific [[literary topos]], that is a place where this way of intellectual life is localized. Meanwhile, in the matter of ethics, he claimed that in a mind cleaned from egoism and disciplined by logic there should appear elements of a general human [[axiology]] whose presence in a human expression needs a deep ethical shock, experience of either own or others' strong testimony. Particularly, he sought it in the context of Christianity where cultivated [[saints]] are the [[sin]]ners who came through the stage of a great internal conversion ''metanoi'' which principally demolished their earlier life's rules, and pointed out that this procedure was unsuccessfully attempted to be implemented on the area of a [[Secularity|secular]] [[communist society]]. He specifically criticized mathematicians, thus including himself, by claiming that sometimes seeing on the might of mathematical brains focused on abstract problems it seemed that there is a [[Satanic ritual abuse|satanic]] force which causes that the most able intellectually individuals are paid for the works meaningless for wellness of humans. By his ethics, he manifestly argued against his own life choices and looked for psychological either self-defense or justification, particularly he claimed that scientists are employed in an intellectual circus whenever they do not try to think on what really is worthy to do, and, for this reason, in the isolated intellectuals there should emerge a [[remorse]] and the will of more dedicated participation in realization of socially important tasks of either a country or the world, because quite well-paid mathematical games are a waste of energy which could be utilized for thinking on real actions having a good purpose. In the case of natural scientists, he claimed that they present a [[world view]] in a careless way, although by their scientific authority and reference to a concrete research they get a substantial expertise in general philosophic beliefs, but by propagation of unfriendly ways they propagate absence of precision because they avoid logical constructions of proofs in favour of a better visual impact. He sought logic as the method against [[epistemological particularism]], for example, he claimed that a [[world view]] demands logical culture and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic-philosophic]] [[insight]], and the way against an intellectual trapping, for example, he had a radical and unpopular point of view that the only formal logic can be the security for language against the issues of a system of assessment by clear extracting, indicating and ordering. In his philosophy, a human condition is a free existence restricted by the various limitations. Accordingly, a human as an animal has the specific features, such like persistent enrichment of life quality, creation of an environment, sensitivity on values, spiritual sphere, investigating [[sainthood]] and [[Transcendence (video game)|transcendence]], ability to creativity and creative thinking, and, moreover, usage of language and symbolic reasoning which gives a control over emotions. However, his psychologist approach collapses in absence of any of his determinants of a perfect human, what means that his philosophical system, including the psychologist logic, is case-dependent and applies to a selected group of humans by emergence on the basis of discrimination against intellectual features, often either inborn or independent on a personal choice.

He was interested in an ethical standpoint and the method of conflict solving known as [[nonviolence]], what means an action without a violence. In relation to this of his research interests, he co-organized stays in Poland for a French [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[Jean Goss]] and an Austrian [[Christian theologian]] and [[anti-war activist]] [[Hildegard Goss-Mayr|Hilderad Gross-Mayr]], who in 2009 got the [[Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award|''Pacem in Terris'' Peace and Freedom Award]] established by the [[Diocese of Davenport|Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport]] in the [[United States|U.S. state]] of [[Iowa]] to commemorate [[Pope John XXIII]]'s the 1963 [[encyclical]] ''[[Pacem in terris]]'' (Peace on Earth) and in 1986 along with her husband got the [[Pope Paul VI Teacher of Peace Award]] by a [[Catholic]] [[peace]] organization [[Pax Christi]] USA. In particular, at the beginning of the Polish trade union federation Independent Self-governing Labour Union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|''Solidarity'']], he organized the meeting of Jean Goss with the then movement leader [[Lech Wałęsa]], who after being awarded by the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize to which the Goss couple were also nominated got also the 2001 [[Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award|''Pacem in Terris'' Peace and Freedom Award]] to recognize his leadership non-violent attitude. The Goss couple became famous as the apostles of nonviolence, particularly for preparation of the [[People Power Revolution|1986 People Power Revolution ('''Yellow Revolution''&lt;nowiki/&gt;')]] in Philippines, and lobbying for recognition of the [[conscientious objection]] by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] during the [[Vatican II|1962–1965 Second Vatican Council]] opened by [[Pope John XXIII]] and closed by [[Pope Paul VI]]. In 1991, just after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Grzegorczyk was instrumental in organization of a symposium in Moscow dedicated to the nonviolence philosophy with participation of the Goss couple as well as a Canadian [[Christian philosophy|Catholic]] philosopher, theologian, and humanitarian [[Jean Vanier]] who was awarded by the 2013 [[Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award|''Pacem in Terris'' Peace and Freedom Award]] and the 2015 [[Templeton Prize]] and an American political scientist and writer on strategy of a nonviolent struggle [[Gene Sharp]] who in 1983 was the founding father of the [[Albert Einstein Institution]] to explore the methods of [[nonviolent resistance]] in conflicts and in 2009–2015 was four times nominated to the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Despite of some kind of liberalism present in his thought, he was a definitely radical thinker, in particular, he propagated a nonviolent dialogue with everyone including terrorists, he was particularly fervent in forcing towards both logic and dialogue with everyone, and he claimed that going towards defense in any conditions of own dignity and inventory is harmful because the [[Christian Doctrine]] of [[turning the other cheek]] is correct. He applied his ethics to a conﬂict resolution, put a particular emphasis onto to the methods of nonviolence professed by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King]], the laureate of the 1965 [[Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award|''Pacem in Terris'' Peace and Freedom Award]], he was also one of the ﬁrst public ﬁgures in Poland who focused attention on the ecological issues, and, before it was widely understood in Poland, he popularized the warnings due to the [[Club of Rome]] which have claimed that the resources of our planet are scarce and the idea of permanent growth is dangerous.

[[People Power Revolution|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]

=== Morality and religious study ===
In his philosophical marriage between religious involvement and both [[reism]] and a specific variant of naturalism, the particular position was occupied by the moral dimension of the religious study from the point of view of Christianity. In his pseudo-essays, pseudo-sermons, and pseudo-treatises collected in the book ''Moralitety'' awarded in 1987 by the prize ''Warszawska Premiera Literacka'' (Warsaw Literary Award), he emphasized the central elements of the Christian doctrine such like the radical command to give a selfless care testimony, especially with respect to an enemy. He attempted to place himself in the role of a Catholic priest who claims that a self-demolition is not important if personal intentions are not allowed to be reduced, whereas in the book ''Europa: odkrywanie sensu istnienia'' (Europe: discovering the sense of existence) he emphasized the role of a logical reasoning in the foundations of civilization achievements to give an axiological [[Philosophy of history|theory of history]]. He claimed therein that the evolutionary development of humankind is accompanied by a specific participation of divine forces into development of human cultures, especially he pointed out altruism and a voluntary service as the examples of such either biological theology or theological biology. Without taking into account directly the Roman Catholic Church's domination in Europe and its enormous impact onto the foundations of the European philosophy in the form of various intellectual restrictions, such like in the most known cases of the Italian scholar [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo Gailei]] and philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], he claimed European scientific theories were always logically ordered and based on deduction, empiricism and phenomenology, and limited the sense of the world to nothing but seeing the world as similar to an understandable text – hence he claimed that the explored world is already a humanly ordered structure. For him, history of religion is just deepening of this sense, with [[Abraham]] placed as the initiator of a new epoch of [[monotheism]] and a biblical reasoning as a pictorial system, which both married with the ancient [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] intellectual traditionalism gives the most appropriate philosophical system.

On his theory, [[Jesus Christ of Nazareth]] appeals for a well-defined individual testimony, and the issues of a daily life are nothing when compared to the extreme situations because Christianity for him is a realization of spiritual rather than vital values. He saw the teachings of Jesus as the acceptance of the European logic, he radically saw Jesus Christ as the provider of the European moral pattern because Jesus demanded and demonstrated coherent individual testimony. According to Grzegorczyk, in a wide sense logic lays the foundations of the European rationalism, with respect to which he identified himself as a cultivator, which says that any knowledge must emerge by logic and empiricism and must go only towards the essential points. By his personal religious standpoint shared with the passion to logic, he always fought against himself and was limited to no more than two possibilities: the way of ethics and its universality and allowing the inexpressible in order to kill the conflict between a reason and religion. Thus, by his point of view, a rational theology is useless in favour of an imprecisely defined spiritual religiousness merely based on ecumenic approach to Christianity, that is for Grzegorczyk the biblical traditionalism of Catholicism losses the intellectual value when compared to the moral testimony of its creator Jesus Christ – a reason married with an openness towards values. What is more interesting for Grzegorczyk's religious creativity, although his formal membership at the Roman Catholic Church he frequently expressed critical opinions on concrete policies of this religious organization, even on the pages of free-thinkers periodicals, and, similarly to a Russian religious philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Slovyov]], he manifestly ignored the [[East–West Schism]] between the Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity, for example he took the [[Eucharist]] sacrament at both the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. He was a fervent follower of Roman Catholics who felt an aﬃnity to the Russian Orthodoxy, his religious reﬂection merged Christian morality to the European cultural tradition and by his views the same values lay the foundations of both Christianity and European rationalism. In his approach, history of Christianity, including its biblical roots, can be considered the history of how a sense and understanding of the world can be deepened by contemplating the sacred and transcendent.

He convinced that [[Modernity]] with its technological development creates the new challenges for humans, whose realization demands both an appropriate ethical mode, such like dedication to other and conscious self-limitations, and the rationalist standpoint. What is intriguing, in practice he realized this of his ideas for a general public in the form of a monk-like modest appearance joined with straightforward and often manifestly ignorant and arrogant if no blatant speech, which by virtue of the dogmatic Christianity could be interpreted in terms of either [[demonic possession]] or [[Blasphemy|act of blasphemy]]. For example, in his article ''Odpowiedzialność filozofów'' (Responsibility of philosophers) he claimed that a philosopher whose texts are at the service of state authorities, creates a vicious circle of unquestionable truths which have not much in common with reality and strengthen the authorities's monopoly on a political violence, similarly to the Roman Catholic Church's theorists who referred to the holy books instead of commenting on the facts, whereas this article was published in May 1981 on the pages of the Polish Catholic quarterly ''[[:pl:Więź (czasopismo)|Więź]]'' with death of the [[Primate of Poland]] [[List of Polish cardinals|Cardinal]] [[Stefan Wyszyński]] as the main subject of the issue and on the eve of introduction of the [[martial law in Poland]] by the communist authorities to crush the political opposition. It was not the only one and episodic case when Grzegorczyk could not clearly and unambiguously decide on his intellectual position with respect to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and the political ideology of the communist state authorities. He openly presented himself in a straightforward opposition to a religious organization when it was convenient and useful to his professional activities and when it gave him a professional advance or other at least societal profit, whereas he became suddenly manifestly religious when he sought any gains to support his ideology by a religion. In particular, the latter feature was ostentatiously expressed by his idea of ecumenism between the Roman Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, especially when he sought the profits in the academic contacts with Russian and Ukrainian academic professionals who humbly supported promotion of his borderline philosophical ideas motivated by himself arranged hospitability and grants.

The big gap in conformity with respect to both political and social association which he adopted from the Roman Catholic-oriented teachers of his war-time underground education supported by his father's attitude was completely filled with a big conformity towards his academic career based on the politicized part of the Polish academia independently on a political system of Poland, what he made with extraordinary intellectual autonomy and a coherent reasoning. Following his personal pseudo-clerical image and pseudo-homiletic written style formed on the dogmatic philosophical traditionalism appropriate to both the [[Church Fathers|Fathers]] and [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Roman Catholic Church]] enriched by the arguments of [[Neo Thomism|neo-Thomism]] and [[Christian existentialism]], he attempted to defend a manifestly old-fashioned model of academic work understood as a humble dedication to ideas and humanity rather than a professionalism. In particular, in his part of the 2005's survey ''Gdzie ta nasza filozofia?'' (Where is this Our Philosophy?) he sought new circumstances of philosophizing as generated by the current fashions and the collective factors such like massiveness of higher education and general commercialization of life, he compared the present-day both philosophers and generally all humanists to businessmen who first of all look for their personal professional success by the way of a relatively fast and an appropriately high return of the incurred hardships rather than a long and arduous effort which leads to a perfect product, and, moreover, he claimed that the sham achievements are fully able to give quite good living conditions to scientists and philosophers because social control over these products is already impossible as a result of development of an academic specialization beyond such control.

=== Social issues ===
For Grzegorczyk, the greatest intellectual challenge was an axiological approach to [[history of the world]]. Taking from the [[Marxist sociology]], he approached [[cultural conflict]] by wealth of a privileged social class as contrasted to poverty of the rest of a society marginalized and excluded from a system focusing on rich, powerful, and clever individuals. He enriched the Marxian thought by emphasis onto the role of intellectual divisions in perpetuation of conflicts, and, similarly to the creators of the [[Aryan race]] theory based on the common [[proto-language]], contributed the [[Utopian]] necessity of a common language for agreement and reconciliation in the global scale, as well as the Utopian idea of an identical insight of all people in understanding the wholeness of human affairs. Furthermore, he attempted to convince that the suitable theoretical apparatus is the only way for the worldly peace, that since needs of everyone can not be satisfied there is the necessity to endure limitations collectively and introduce global regulations on the basis of a persuasive argument, and that a synthesis of scientific knowledge is necessary to serve the fair and [[peaceful coexistence]], a theory solidified in 1956 by a [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|Soviet leader]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]-inspired [[Soviet foreign policy]] at the 20th Congress of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] and applied by the [[Soviet Union]] and the Soviet-allied [[socialist state]]s such like the communist Poland during the [[Cold War|1947–1991 Cold War]], especially in the phases [[Cold War (1953–1962)]] and [[Cold War (1962–1979)]]. Grzegorczyk doctrinally did not respect any form of pluralism and any kind of diversity among humankind, he sought the order in a large scale uniformity which is appropriate to the political ideologies which laid the foundations of the [[Totalitarianism|20th century totalitarianism in Europe]] – both [[German Nazism]] and [[Soviet communism]]. For this reason, implicitly, he sought the European totalitarianism as the consequence of the European cultural heritage supported by his logic. On the basis of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], he appealed to the United Nations to take into account the principle that ''every person has the right to help any other person in a worse position than himself or herself in whatever country that person may reside'', what in 1977 met the applause due to an American-Jewish leftist philosopher and left-wing activist [[Noam Chomsky]] who published a fragment of his correspondence with Grzegorczyk.

In the aftermath of the famous 1972's report ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' by the [[Club of Rome]], he developed his general Utopian idea of all-human solidarity by propagation of self-limitations on [[Consumption (sociology)|consumption]] and combating [[wastefulness]]. In contrary to his 'general [[well-being]]' utopia, in the case of political ethics he mostly contributed to criticism of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|''Solidarity'']], the [[Eastern bloc]]'s first independent trade union recognized by a communist regime and created in September 1980 at the [[Gdańsk Shipyard|Vladimir Lenin Shipyard]] in [[Gdańsk]] under the leadership of [[Lech Wałęsa]], in the time when the communist Poland was strongly divided between its supporters and opponents, and when there was not a place for the 'middle option' between the yes and the no for the anti-communist opposition. Despite that Grzegorczyk at this time was not an open supporter to the Polish government, it was understood as his direct [[conformity]] with the communist authorities in the name of his false concept of peace, and, consequently, the society of the Catholic intellectuals related to the magazine ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' (The Catholic Weekly) broke collaboration with him. Moreover, although he survived the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|1939–1945 Nazi–Soviet occupation of Poland]] and was injured as an insurgent of the [[Warsaw Uprising|1944 Warsaw Uprising]], he manifestly demonstrated a glaring absence of sensitivity on the problem of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], and also in this case his attitude entirely confirmed the crucial impact due to the war-time underground teachers of strictly nationalist-Catholic orientation. In 1993, he authored an article ''Dekalog rozumu'' (Ten commandments of reason) which proposed the moral rules ''1. You will not clap, 2. You will not whistle, 3. Listen to the content, not the tone of expression, 4. Fight with an argument, not with a human, 5. Do not flatter other and yourself, 6. Distrust other and yourself, 7. Search for what is important, 8. Try to build something better, instead to look for scapegoats, 9. Do not generalize too hastily, 10. Do not use proverbs, they are usually a stupidity of nations'', which imitated and caricatured the [[Ten Commandments]] by an [[Old Testament|Old-Testament]] Jewish leader [[Moses]] to ridicule the biblical foundations of [[Judaeo Christianity|Judeo-Christianity]] by comparing them to the academic work.

=== Education ===
Grzegorczyk had a paradoxically formed mindset, a mind which was as modal as a modal logic. By the variety of his views, he criticized and was criticized by more radical exponents of various ideological positions – Catholics disliked his contacts with [[Atheism|Atheists]], Atheists accused him of [[clericalism]], anti-communists disliked his attempts for searching the middle position, communists questioned his defense of freedom. He wanted to marry all with everyone, but his idea of unification was able to create only a borderline philosophical system whose followers create a dramatic minority even in the academic philosophy of Poland. The unpopularity of his system is contained in the open discrimination inherited with idealism, especially the German idealism such like of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] which served as the philosophical basis for the [[Nazi Germany]] political ideology by [[Adolf Hitler]]. His logically trivialized philosophical views were inadequate for both communists and anti-communists, for both religious and irreligious individuals, for both philosophers and scientists, because he manifestly avoided a strict association with any concrete group and, in fact, participated in a one-person struggle for independence and freedom.

Despite that he was a well functioned academic personality among few major specialized groups – mathematicians, philosophers, Catholic intellectuals, people of art – and was active in the international society of socio-political activists, he solicitously worked on the public self-picture which presented him as independent on political, social, religious, and scientific relationships to get some popularity among students in the times when the Polish academia was directly dependent on the communist ideology and governed by the politicized scholars. Nevertheless, in his daily work, he tended to the goals which created the appraisal of an inexhaustible way towards extraordinary egoism and self-comfort with a help of conformity with any of the aforementioned systems, he simply used his social links and professional connections within these systems when it was necessary to him. For example, he manifestly declared in public to audiences and students that he had never tended to get any higher positions in academia, whereas actually he easily accepted all higher positions offered to him and abandoned a work only when he sought is as inconvenient with respect to his purposes, such like the cultural and political ones met in [[Amsterdam]] which were in a direct conflict with his religious and ideological views adequate to the reduced both intellectual and social expression in the [[communist Poland]].

He had never attempted to be a favourite academic teacher, he openly avoided any close cooperations with his students and deflected their attention by lack of will to co-authorship with a parallel will to interact with them for knowing more about them, he preferred a bold individual research work although he had multiple collaborations. He was hungry for knowledge on world and people, such like in the 'ecumenic dialogue' with the Soviets and the various Polish communists, but was never able to fully follow any concrete system, had never joined any political party, and was focused merely on collecting information only for construction of a possible either critique or irony. Even those very few students who decided to prepare their doctoral dissertations under his supervising, never felt to contribute in the work of their mentor and to continue his intellectual traditionalism, because emergence of an academic school dedicated to development of his heritage in mathematics, logic, ethics, philosophy was impossible by his attitude. He was able to attract the attention of students extremely rarely, the facts say for themselves in the best way – over more than six decades of his academic work, he was able to produce no more than three doctoral students with 10–20 years of difference between the graduations, he supervised a [[computer scientist]] Stanisław Waligórski's thesis in mathematics ''Equations in closure algebras and their applications'' (1964), a Polish-Jewish philosopher and mathematician [[Stanisław Krajewski]]'s thesis in logic ''Nonstandard classes of satisfiability and their applications in investigating of some extensions of axiomatic theories'' (1975), and an [[Aesthetics|aesthetician]] Bohdan Misiuna's thesis in ethics ''Philosophical analysis of disgust phenomena and its axiological consequences'' (1992).

Since the time of his underground higher education, both he had supported and he was supported primarily by the politically involved academic teachers such like [[Bogdan Suchodolski]] and also [[Jan Łukasiewicz]]. When [[Bogdan Suchodolski|Suchodolski]] organized interdisciplinary meetings for professors in the [[Jabłonna Palace|Palace of Congresses and Conferences]] of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]] in [[Jabłonna, Legionowo County|Jabłonna near Warsaw]] in presence of a meticulously chosen audience, in particular the students who had the preferred 'social origin', then he served humbly as the pillar. In the time of the dominant socialist orthodoxy, he presented himself as the 'Jesus Christ' of the Polish humanities – for students his philosophy was beyond the bias, intellectual enslavement and hardline correctness of the state ideology. For the communist Poland's state authorities he was officially a [[persona non grata]] secured by the politically useful historical family background, whereas for the academic youth he served as the 'socrealist [[Messiah]]' against the system teachings. He was a talented speaker towards the youth, in both [[philosophizing]] and personal action he avoided biased and [[emotion]]al notions, particularism, cultivation of a scheme, routine, institution in favour of an individual, and impressive words. He impacted onto an authentic individual attitude by his analytical, synthetic and globalist reasoning, criticism on own activities, selflessness in cognitive actions, promotion of a selective truth, constant attention and control over research by the selective values based on the specific union of the Christian theology and liberalized [[Marxist thought]].

On the one hand, his style of giving opinions was particularly distinctive in both criticism and straightforwardness, often manifestly explicit and giving the impression of directly either conflicting with or fighting against the ideals which he supported theoretically, but, on the other hand, he expressed opinions only when it was fully convenient and safe for his professional and intellectual position and preserved his personal [[world view]]. His logically radicalized philosophical system was the specific mixture of the [[Christian theology]] and the [[Communist Ideology]] which directed his primary logical thought onto the intellectual margins to walk on the borderlines with a [[liberation theology]] and a [[religious communism]], and to visit these extremist and anarchistic territories time by time for an intellectual explosion. In a clear opposition to pluralism of the world, he manifestly claimed existence of the selective values which are absolute and universal in the earthly scale. His theoretical pedagogy, more precisely philosophy of education, was based on the specific ideological mode of nonviolence philosophy, which was particularly attractive in the period of development of anti-communist opposition and political repressions in the communist Poland. He left an explicit context of the [[Communist Ideology]] in favour of his own ideology on both similarity of life and creativity, and action and rationalism which by an ecumenic approach married the [[Christian theology]] with selected concepts of [[Marxism]] with the background in logic. However, his philosophy was able to inspire educational theory and practice in Poland by freedom, tolerance, independent choice, individual rights, and the dictate of the related professional duties of an educator. On the other hand, also his ideology of democracy was attractive for some young intellectuals of the communist Poland, because it employed the concepts of a civil society and discussion community formed by a scattering between [[totalitarianism]] and [[anti-totalitarianism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1257">'''Bonnesen's inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] relating the length, the area, the radius of the [[incircle]] and the radius of the [[circumcircle]] of a [[Jordan curve]].  It is a strengthening of the classical [[isoperimetry|isoperimetric inequality]].

More precisely, consider a planar simple closed curve of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; bounding a domain of area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote the radii of the incircle and the circumcircle.  Bonnesen proved the inequality

:&lt;math&gt; \pi^2 (R-r)^2 \leq L^2-4\pi A. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The term &lt;math&gt; \pi^2 (R-r)^2&lt;/math&gt; in the left hand side is known as the ''isoperimetric defect''.

[[Loewner's torus inequality]] with isosystolic defect is a [[Systolic geometry|systolic]] analogue of Bonnesen's inequality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2524">In [[mathematics]], the '''Borel–Carathéodory theorem''' in [[complex analysis]] shows that an [[analytic function]] may be [[Bounded function|bounded]] by its [[real part]]. It is an application of the [[maximum modulus principle]]. It is named for [[Émile Borel]] and [[Constantin Carathéodory]].

== Statement of the theorem ==

Let a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be analytic on a [[closed disc]] of [[radius]] ''R'' centered at the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Suppose that ''r'' &lt; ''R''. Then, we have the following inequality:

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_r \le \frac{2r}{R-r} \sup_{|z| \le R} \operatorname{Re} f(z) + \frac{R+r}{R-r} |f(0)|. &lt;/math&gt;

Here, the norm on the left-hand side denotes the maximum value of ''f'' in the closed disc:

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_r = \max_{|z| \le r} |f(z)| =  \max_{|z| = r} |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt;

(where the last equality is due to the maximum modulus principle).

== Proof ==

Define ''A'' by

: &lt;math&gt; A = \sup_{|z| \le R} \operatorname{Re} f(z). &lt;/math&gt;

First let ''f''(0) = 0. Since ''Re f'' is harmonic, we may take ''A''&gt;0. ''f'' maps into the half-plane ''P'' to the left of the ''x''=''A'' line. Roughly, our goal is to map this half-plane to a disk, apply [[Schwarz's lemma]] there, and make out the stated inequality.

&lt;math&gt;w \mapsto w/A - 1&lt;/math&gt; sends ''P'' to the standard left half-plane. &lt;math&gt;w \mapsto R(w+1)/(w-1)&lt;/math&gt; sends the left half-plane to the circle of radius ''R'' centered at the origin. The composite, which maps 0 to 0, is the desired map:

:&lt;math&gt;w \mapsto \frac{Rw}{w-2A}.&lt;/math&gt;

From Schwarz's lemma applied to the composite of this map and ''f'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|Rf(z)|}{|f(z)-2A|} \leq |z|.&lt;/math&gt;

Take |''z''| &amp;le; ''r''. The above becomes

:&lt;math&gt;R|f(z)| \leq r|f(z) - 2A| \leq r|f(z)| + 2Ar&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;|f(z)| \leq \frac{2Ar}{R-r}&lt;/math&gt;,

as claimed. In the general case, we may apply the above to ''f''(''z'')-''f''(0):

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  |f(z)|-|f(0)|
    &amp;\leq |f(z)-f(0)|
     \leq \frac{2r}{R-r} \sup_{|w| \leq R} \operatorname{Re}(f(w) - f(0)) \\
    &amp;\leq \frac{2r}{R-r} \left(\sup_{|w| \leq R} \operatorname{Re} f(w) + |f(0)|\right),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which, when rearranged, gives the claim.

The chief purpose of the component analysis is to identify the component which is efficacious in changing behavior, if a singular component exists.&lt;ref name="Baer et al" /&gt;

Eliminating ineffective or less effective components may help with improving social validity, reducing aversive elements, improving generalization and maintenance, as well as administrative efficacy.

It is also a required skill for the [[Licensed behavior analyst|BCBA]].&lt;ref&gt;Behavior Analyst Task List," 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decision field theory''' ('''DFT''') is a dynamic-cognitive approach to human decision making. It is a [[cognitive model]] that describes how people actually make decisions rather than a [[rational]] or [[normative theory]] that prescribes what people should or ought to do. It is also a [[dynamic model]] of [[decision making]] rather than a static model, because it describes how a person's preferences evolve across time until a decision is reached rather than assuming a fixed state of preference. The preference evolution process is mathematically represented as a stochastic process called a [[diffusion process]]. It is used to predict how humans make decisions under uncertainty, how decisions change under time pressure, and how choice context changes preferences. This model can be used to predict not only the choices that are made but also decision or [[Mental chronometry|response times]].

The paper "Decision Field Theory" was published by [[Jerome Busemeyer|Jerome R. Busemeyer]] and [[James Townsend (psychologist)|James T. Townsend]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Busemeyer, J.

==Introduction==
The name ''decision field theory'' was chosen to reflect the fact that the inspiration for this theory comes from an earlier approach - avoidance conflict model contained in [[Kurt Lewin]]'s general psychological theory, which he called ''field'' theory. DFT is a member of a general class of sequential sampling models that are commonly used in a variety of fields in cognition.&lt;ref name=ashby2000&gt;Ashby, F. G. (2000). A stochastic version of general recognition theory. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 44, 310–329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nosofsky1997&gt;Nosofsky, R. M., &amp; Palmeri, T. J. (1997).

The basic ideas underlying the decision process for sequential sampling models is illustrated in Figure 1 below. Suppose the decision maker is initially presented with a choice between three risky prospects, A, B, C, at time t = 0. The horizontal axis on the figure represents deliberation time (in seconds), and the vertical axis represents preference strength. Each trajectory in the figure represents the preference state for one of the risky prospects at each moment in time.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;[[File:SamplePathsDiffusionProcess.jpg|frame|center|Figure 1 — Sample paths for a diffusion process]]

Intuitively, at each moment in time, the decision maker thinks about various payoffs of each prospect, which produces an affective reaction, or valence, to each prospect. These valences are integrated across time to produce the preference state at each moment. In this example, during the early stages of processing (between 200 and 300 ms), attention is focused on advantages favoring prospect C, but later (after 600 ms) attention is shifted toward advantages favoring prospect A. The stopping rule for this process is controlled by a threshold (which is set equal to 1.0 in this example): the first prospect to reach the top threshold is accepted, which in this case is prospect A after about two seconds. Choice probability is determined by the first option to win the race and cross the upper threshold, and decision time is equal to the deliberation time required by one of the prospects to reach this threshold.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;

The threshold is an important parameter for controlling speed–accuracy tradeoffs. If the threshold is set to a lower value (about .30) in Figure 1, then prospect C would be chosen instead of prospect A (and done so earlier). Thus decisions can reverse under time pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Diederich, A. (2003). MDFT account of decision making under time pressure. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 10(1), 157–166.&lt;/ref&gt; High thresholds require a strong preference state to be reached, which allows more information about the prospects to be sampled, prolonging the deliberation process, and increasing accuracy. Low thresholds allow a weak preference state to determine the decision, which cuts off sampling information about the prospects, shortening the deliberation process, and decreasing accuracy. Under high time pressure, decision makers must choose a low threshold; but under low time pressure, a higher threshold can be used to increase accuracy. Very careful and deliberative decision makers tend to use a high threshold, and impulsive and careless decision makers use a low threshold.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;
To provide a bit more formal description of the theory, assume that the decision maker has a choice among three actions, and also suppose for simplicity that there are only four possible final outcomes. Thus each action is defined by a probability distribution across these four outcomes. The affective values produced by each payoff are represented by the values m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. At any moment in time, the decision maker anticipates the payoff of each action, which produces a momentary evaluation, U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t), for action i. This momentary evaluation is an attention-weighted average of the affective evaluation of each payoff: U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = Σ W&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(t)m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. The attention weight at time t, W&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(t), for payoff j offered by action i, is assumed to fluctuate according to a stationary stochastic process. This reflects the idea that attention is shifting from moment to moment, causing changes in the anticipated payoff of each action across time. The momentary evaluation of each action is compared with other actions to form a valence for each action at each moment, v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t) – U.(t), where U.(t) equals the average across all the momentary actions. The valence represents the momentary advantage or disadvantage of each action. The total valence balances out to zero so that all the options cannot become attractive simultaneously. Finally, the valences are the inputs to a dynamic system that integrates the valences over time to generate the output preference states. The output preference state for action i at time t is symbolized as P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t). The dynamic system is described by the following linear stochastic difference equation for a small time step h in the deliberation process: P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t+h) = Σ s&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;(t)+v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t+h).The positive self feedback coefficient, s&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; = s &gt; 0, controls the memory for past input valences for a preference state. Values of s&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 suggest decay in the memory or impact of previous valences over time, whereas values of s&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1 suggest growth in impact over time (primacy effects). The negative lateral feedback coefficients, s&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; = s&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 for i not equal to j, produce competition among actions so that the strong inhibit the weak. In other words, as preference for one action grows stronger, then this moderates the preference for other actions. The magnitudes of the lateral inhibitory coefficients are assumed to be an increasing function of the similarity between choice options. These lateral inhibitory coefficients are important for explaining context effects on preference described later. Formally, this is a Markov process; matrix formulas have been mathematically derived for computing the choice probabilities and distribution of choice response times.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;

The decision field theory can also be seen as a dynamic and stochastic random walk theory of decision making, presented as a model positioned between lower-level neural activation patterns and more complex notions of decision making found in psychology and economics.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;

==Explaining context effects==
The DFT is capable of explaining context effects that many decision making theories are unable to explain.&lt;ref&gt;Roe, R. M., Busemeyer, J. R., &amp; Townsend, J. T. (2001). Multi-alternative decision field theory: A dynamic connectionist model of decision-making. Psychological Review, 108, 370–392.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many classic probabilistic models of choice satisfy two rational types of choice principles. One principle is called [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], and according to this principle, if the probability of choosing option X is greater than option Y when only X,Y are available, then option X should remain more likely to be chosen over Y even when a new option Z is added to the choice set. In other words, adding an option should not change the preference relation between the original pair of options. A second principle is called regularity, and according to this principle, the probability of choosing option X from a set containing only X and Y should be greater than or equal to the probability of choosing option X from a larger set containing options X, Y, and a new option Z. In other words, adding an option should only decrease the probability of choosing one of the original pair of options. However, empirical findings obtained by consumer researchers studying human choice behavior have found systematic context effects that systematically violate both of these principles.

The first context effect is the similarity effect. This effect occurs with the introduction of a third option S that is similar to X but it is not dominated by X. For example, suppose X is a BMW, Y is a Ford focus, and S is an Audi. The Audi is similar to the BMW because both are not very economical but they are both high quality and sporty. The Ford focus is different from the BMW and Audi because it is more economical but lower quality. Suppose in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y. Next suppose a new choice set is formed by adding an option S that is similar to X. If X is similar to S, and both are very different from Y, the people tend to view X and S as one group and Y as another option. Thus the probability of Y remains the same whether S is presented as an option or not. However, the probability of X will decrease by approximately half with the introduction of S. This causes the probability of choosing X to drop below Y when S is added to the choice set. This violates the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y, but when S is added, then Y is chosen more frequently than X.

The second context effect is the compromise effect. This effect occurs when an option C is added that is a compromise between X and Y. For example, when choosing between C = Honda and X = BMW, the latter is less economical but higher quality. However, if another option Y = Ford Focus is added to the choice set, then C = Honda becomes a compromise between X = BMW and Y = Ford Focus. Suppose in a binary choice, X (BMW) is chosen more often than C (Honda). But when option Y (Ford Focus) is added to the choice set, then option C (Honda) becomes the compromise between X (BMW) and Y (Ford Focus), and C is then chosen more frequently than X. This is another violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because X is chosen more often than C in a binary choice, but C when option Y is added to the choice set, then C is chosen more often than X.

The third effect is called the attraction effect. This effect occurs when the third option D is very similar to X but D is defective compared to X. For example D may be a new sporty car developed by a new manufacturer that is similar to option X = BMW, but costs more than the BMW. Therefore, there is little or no reason to choose D over X, and in this situation D is rarely ever chosen over X. However, adding D to a choice set boosts the probability of choosing X. In particular, the probability of choosing X from a set containing X,Y,D is larger than the probability of choosing X from a set containing only X and Y. The defective option D makes X shine, and this attraction effect violates the principle of regularity, which says that adding another option cannot increase the popularity of an option over the original subset.

DFT accounts for all three effects using the same principles and same parameters across all three findings. According to DFT, the attention switching mechanism is crucial for producing the similarity effect, but the lateral inhibitory connections are critical for explaining the compromise and attraction effects. If the attention switching process is eliminated, then the similarity effect disappears, and if the lateral connections are all set to zero, then the attraction and compromise effects disappear. This property of the theory entails an interesting prediction about the effects of time pressure on preferences. The contrast effects produced by lateral inhibition require time to build up, which implies that the attraction and compromise effects should become larger under prolonged deliberation (see Roe et al.2001). Alternatively, if context effects are produced by switching from a weighted average rule under binary choice to a quick heuristic strategy for the triadic choice, then these effects should get larger under time pressure. Empirical tests show that prolonging the decision process increases the effects &lt;ref&gt;Pettibone, J. C. (2012). Testing the effect of time pressure on asymmetric dominance and compromise decoys in choice. Judgment and Decision Making, 7(4), 513-523.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, I. (1989). Choice based on reasons: The case of attraction and compromise effects. Journal of Consumer Research, 16, 158–174.&lt;/ref&gt; and time pressure decreases the effects.&lt;ref&gt;Dhar, R., Nowlis, S. M., &amp; Sherman, S. J. (2000). Trying hard or hardly trying: An analysis of context effects in choice. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 9, 189–200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
The Decision Field Theory has demonstrated an ability to account for a wide range of findings from behavioral decision making for which the purely algebraic and deterministic models often used in economics and psychology cannot account. Recent studies that record neural activations in non-human primates during perceptual decision making tasks have revealed that neural firing rates closely mimic the accumulation of preference theorized by behaviorally-derived diffusion models of decision making.&lt;ref name="busemeyer2006b"&gt;Busemeyer, J. R., R. K. Jessup, Joseph G. Johnson, James T. Townsend. (2006). [http://mypage.iu.edu/~jbusemey/NeuralNet.pdf Building bridges between neural models and complex decision making behavior]. Neural Networks 19(8): 1047-1058.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision processes of sensory-motor decisions are beginning to be fairly well understood both at the behavioral and neural levels. Typical findings indicate that neural activation regarding stimulus movement information is accumulated across time up to a threshold, and a behavioral response is made as soon as the activation in the recorded area exceeds the threshold&lt;ref&gt;Schall, J. D. (2003). Neural correlates of decision processes: neural and mental chronometry. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 13(2), 182–186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, J. I., &amp; Shadlen, M. N. (2000). Representation of a perceptual decision in developing oculomotor commands. Nature, 404(6776), 390–394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazurek, M. E., Roitman, J. D., Ditterich, J., &amp; Shadlen, M. N. (2003). A role for neural integrators in perceptual decision making. Cerebral Cortex, 13(11), 1257–1269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, R., Cherian, A., &amp; Segraves, M. (2003). A comparison of macaque behavior and superior colliculus neuronal activity to predictions from models of two-choice decisions. Journal of Neurophysiology, 90(3), 1392–1407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shadlen, M. N., &amp; Newsome, W. T. (2001). Neural basis of a perceptual decision in the parietal cortex (area LIP) of the rhesus monkey. Journal of Neurophysiology, 86(4), 1916–1936.&lt;/ref&gt; for examples). A conclusion that one can draw is that the neural areas responsible for planning or carrying out certain actions are also responsible for deciding the action to carry out, a decidedly embodied notion.&lt;ref name="busemeyer2006b" /&gt;

Mathematically, the spike activation pattern, as well as the choice and response time distributions, can be well described by what are known as diffusion models - especially in [[Two-alternative forced choice]] tasks(see Smith &amp; Ratcliff&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. L., &amp; Ratcliff, R. (2004). Psychology and neurobiology of simple decisions. Trends in Neurosciences, 27(3), 161–168.&lt;/ref&gt; for a summary). Diffusion models, such as the decision field theory, can be viewed as stochastic recurrent neural network models, except that the dynamics are approximated by linear systems. The linear approximation is important for maintaining a mathematically tractable analysis of systems perturbed by noisy inputs. In addition to these neuroscience applications, diffusion models (or their discrete time, random walk, analogues) have been used by cognitive scientists to model performance in a variety of tasks ranging from sensory detection,&lt;ref name=smith1995/&gt; and perceptual discrimination,&lt;ref name=laming1968/&gt;&lt;ref name=link1975/&gt;&lt;ref name=usher2001/&gt; to memory recognition,&lt;ref name=ratcliff1978/&gt; and categorization.&lt;ref name=ashby2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=nosofsky1997/&gt; Thus, diffusion models provide the potential to form a theoretical bridge between neural models of sensory-motor tasks and behavioral models of complex-cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="busemeyer2006b" /&gt;

[[File:Dynamic Syntax Tree Structure.png|thumb|Dynamic Syntax Tree Structure]]
''Dynamic Syntax Tree''' (''DST'''), was created by M.Barzanti &lt;ref name="StaticAnalysis"&gt;D.Syman, M.Barzanti (1999). {{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/26573278/Static_Analysis_of_Applications_written_in_modern_languages|title=Static Analysis of Applications written in modern languages}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative of [[Abstract syntax tree]] and [[Parse tree]] representation of the structure of [[source code]] written in a [[programming language]]. Unlike the [[Statically typed programming languages]], the analysis of a [[Dynamic programming language]] has to estimate the [[Type system]] (types, variables, functions) from the code fragment semantics, as well as all [[Configuration file]]s and [[Binary file]]s. Dynamic Syntax Tree implementation also take into account non-static and non-typed implicit and explicit [[Declaration (computer programming)]]s, so that the resulting information covers most of readable dynamic code fragments.

Mapping of [[language construct]]s from a dynamic language into a Dynamic Syntax Tree (DST) is a kind of [[semantic analysis (compilers)]]. Information implying from the syntax is analyzed and the results are inserted back into the same tree, but in the form of complete static information. [[Preprocessor|Preprocessing]] the [[source code]] will create a specialized Syntax Tree for each Class found. That can be applied to traditional programming languages too, like [[COBOL]], where Classes can be represented by Programs, Methods by calls/Performs, Parameter by Using etc.

== Application in SAST tools==
Dynamic syntax trees are mostly used in [[program analysis]] and [[program transformation]] systems.&lt;ref name="DST"&gt;D.Syman, M.Barzanti (2001). {{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/26504665/Static_Analysis_a_Dynamic_Syntax_Tree_implementation|title=Static Analysis: a Dynamic Syntax Tree implementation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dynamic syntax trees are [[data structures]] used in some [[Static program analysis]] tools, due to their property of fast representing an optimized structure of program code and its related [[Binary file]].&lt;ref name="StaticAnalysisNewAlgorithms"&gt;D.Syman, M.Barzanti (2013). {{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/26302793/Static_Analysis_new_emerging_algorithms|title=Static Analysis: new emerging algorithms}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dynamic Syntax Tree is used by [http://www.securityreviewer.net/ Security Reviewer] and [http://www.documentreviewer.net/ Document Reviewer] core engines.

=== Motivation ===
* Compared to the [[source code]], a DST does not include certain elements, such as inessential punctuation and delimiters (braces, semicolons, parentheses, etc.).
* The whole source file, in a parsed form, must be processed and every expression or construct has to be analyzed. As a result, it extends some existing node information or add new declaration nodes (implicit declarations). In static languages it is typically sufficient to scan declaration constructs only (class declaration, variable declaration etc.); single expressions are not needed for collecting available symbols and their description. 
* In addition to statically defined symbols other tree nodes are added using the semantic analysis of the DST. Also some existing information can be modified. Particular expressions are scanned to find, e.g. implicitly declared variables and dynamically added object members. Also possible variable values, estimated types and behavior influenced from configuration are discovered. The so far built DST  is used for that. Process of mapping the Assignment Expression, containing Variable Usage (including the one declared in web pages or JavaScript) into the static declaration of used variable and Configuration files influencing the Behavior, is depicted on the Figure at right side.
* The mapping collects known information from the expressions and stores it into the static representation of the source code (DST). The process of single Dynamic Syntax Tree mapping is performed every time the corresponding source code changes, hence it is suitable to implement some optimizations. Also, there could be trees containing symbols from large static language libraries, e.g. from .NET assemblies, which manage typically thousands of symbols. Initializing all of them may be too slow.&lt;ref name="DSTResults"&gt;D.Syman, M.Barzanti (2012). {{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/26717763/Dynamic_Syntax_Tree_Implementation_Results|title=Dynamic_Syntax_Tree_Implementation_Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differently from [[Abstract syntax tree]] and CST [[Parse tree]], in case of huge Classes having more than 65535 objects, the DST Object Dictionary structure (68,083 nodes), will be paged into some small XML files, about 575KB sized each. The same will be done with the Dynamic Syntax Tree itself: only 4096 Classes at time will be processed, max 135KB each. There will be no case of RAM [[Random access memory]] usage over 700MB, that means it can be able to perform a Static Analysis using a low-end Windows XP notebook with 1GB of RAM and a single-core processor, and up to 5 simultaneously static analysis of different applications at time can be achieved using only a 4GB RAM, dual-core processor machine. So, performances will be scalable depending of hardware architecture, with the guarantee of performing at least a complete static analysis starting from a notebook and going up to multi-core machine. An important optimization respect than AST and CST will be the number of tree nodes. For example, GCC 2.52 from SPEC 95 [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation]] benchmark suite comprises 604,000 AST nodes vs only 127,067 nodes paged in 2 DST, and Word 1.1A (1990) comprises 607,700 AST nodes vs only 204,249 nodes, paged in 3 DST. GCC 2.52 is about 140,000 lines of code and Word 1.1A is about 322,000. Static Analysis processing times using DST were half an hour for GCC and 1 hour and half for Word 1.1A. Word 1.1A source was downloaded from [[Computer History Museum]] site. Some of additional information initialization can be postponed until it is requested, because not all of the source elements must be analyzed and mapped immediately.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12995">In [[mathematics]], especially in applications of [[linear algebra]] to [[physics]], the '''Einstein notation''' or '''Einstein summation convention''' is a notational convention that implies summation over a set of indexed terms in a formula, thus achieving notational brevity. As part of mathematics it is a notational subset of [[Ricci calculus]]; however, it is often used in applications in physics that do not distinguish between [[Tangent space|tangent]] and [[cotangent space|cotangent]] spaces. It was introduced to physics by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1916.&lt;ref name=Ein1916&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Einstein |coauthors= |title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=1916 |publisher= |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |format=[[PDF]] |id= |accessdate=2006-09-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==

===Statement of convention===

According to this convention, when an index variable appears twice in a single term and is not otherwise defined (see [[free and bound variables]]), it implies summation of that term over all the values of the index. So where the indices can range over the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|{1, 2, 3}|}},

:&lt;math&gt;y = \sum_{i = 1}^3 c_i x^i = c_1 x^1 + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3&lt;/math&gt;

is simplified by the convention to:

:
&lt;math&gt;y = c_i x^i&lt;/math&gt;.

The upper indices are not [[Exponentiation|exponents]] but are indices of coordinates, [[coefficient]]s or [[basis vector]]s. That is, in this context {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} should be understood as the second component of {{math|'''x'''}} rather than the square of {{math|'''x'''}} (this can occasionally lead to ambiguity).  The upper index position in {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;}} is because, typically, an index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term (see 'Application' below).  And typically {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} would be equivalent to the traditional {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}.

In [[general relativity]], a common convention is that 
*the [[Greek alphabet]] is used for space and time components, where indices take on values 0, 1, 2, or 3 (frequently used letters are {{math|''μ'', ''ν'', ...}}), 
*the [[Latin alphabet]] is used for spatial components only, where indices take on values 1, 2, or 3 (frequently used letters are {{math|''i'', ''j'', ...}}),

In general, indices can range over any [[Indexed family|indexing set]], including an [[infinite set]]. This should not be confused with a typographically similar convention used to distinguish between [[tensor index notation]] and the closely related but distinct basis-independent [[abstract index notation]].

An index that is summed over is a ''summation index'', in this case "{{math|''i''}}". It is also called a [[bound variable|dummy index]] since any symbol can replace "{{math|''i''}}" without changing the meaning of the expression provided that it does not collide with index symbols in the same term.

An index that is not summed over is a [[free variable|''free index'']] and should appear only once per term.  If such an index does appear, it usually also appears in terms belonging to the same sum, with the exception of special values such as zero.

===Application===

Einstein notation can be applied in slightly different ways. Typically, each index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term; however, the convention can be applied more generally to any repeated indices within a term.&lt;ref name="wolfram"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EinsteinSummation.html |title=Einstein Summation|accessdate=13 April 2011 |last= |first= |year= |work= |publisher=Wolfram Mathworld }}&lt;/ref&gt; When dealing with [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant and contravariant]] vectors, where the position of an index also indicates the type of vector, the first case usually applies; a covariant vector can only be contracted with a contravariant vector, corresponding to summation of the products of coefficients. On the other hand, when there is a fixed coordinate basis (or when not considering coordinate vectors), one may choose to use only subscripts; see ''{{section link||Superscripts and subscripts versus only subscripts}}'' below.

==Vector representations==

=== Superscripts and subscripts versus only subscripts ===

In terms of [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]], 
* upper indices represent components of [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant vectors]] ([[coordinate vector|vector]]s), 
* lower indices represent components of [[covariant vector|covariant]] vectors ([[covector]]s).

They transform contravariantly or covariantly, respectively, with respect to change of basis.

In recognition of this fact, the following notation uses the same symbol both for a (co)vector and its ''components'', as in:
:&lt;math&gt;v = v^i e_i = \begin{bmatrix}e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; e_n\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}v^1 \\ v^2 \\ \vdots \\ v^n\end{bmatrix} \qquad w = w_i e^i = \begin{bmatrix}w_1 &amp; w_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; w_n\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}e^1 \\ e^2 \\ \vdots \\ e^n\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the vector and {{math|''v&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are its components (not the {{math|''i''}}th covector {{math|''v''}}), {{math|''w''}} is the covector and {{math|''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are its components.

In the presence of a non-degenerate form (an isomorphism {{math|''V'' → ''V''{{i sup|∗}}}}, for instance a [[Riemannian metric]] or [[Minkowski metric]]), one can [[raising and lowering indices|raise and lower indices]].

A basis gives such a form (via the [[dual basis]]), hence when working on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with a Euclidean metric and a fixed orthonormal basis, one has the option to work with only subscripts.

However, if one changes coordinates, the way that coefficients change depends on the variance of the object, and one cannot ignore the distinction; see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]].

===Mnemonics===

In the above example, vectors are represented as {{math|''n'' × 1}} matrices (column vectors), while covectors are represented as {{math|1 × ''n''}} matrices (row covectors).

When using the column vector convention

* "'''Up'''per indices go '''up''' to down; '''l'''ower indices go '''l'''eft to right."
* "'''Co'''variant tensors are '''row''' vectors that have indices that are bel'''ow''' ('''co-below-row''')."
* Covectors are row vectors:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}w_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; w_k\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
:Hence the lower index indicates which ''column'' you are in.
* Contravariant vectors are column vectors:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}v^1 \\ \vdots \\ v^k\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:Hence the upper index indicates which ''row'' you are in.

=== Abstract description ===

The virtue of Einstein notation is that it represents the invariant quantities with a simple notation.

In physics, a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] is invariant under transformations of [[basis (mathematics)|basis]]. In particular, a [[Lorentz scalar]] is invariant under a Lorentz transformation. The individual terms in the sum are not. When the basis is changed, the ''components'' of a vector change by a linear transformation described by a matrix. This led Einstein to propose the convention that repeated indices imply the summation is to be done.

As for covectors, they change by the inverse matrix. This is designed to guarantee that the linear function associated with the covector, the sum above, is the same no matter what the basis is.

The value of the Einstein convention is that it applies to other vector spaces built from {{math|''V''}} using the [[tensor product]] and [[dual space|duality]]. For example, {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''V''}}, the tensor product of {{math|''V''}} with itself, has a basis consisting of tensors of the form {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Any tensor {{math|'''T'''}} in {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''V''}} can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T^{ij}\mathbf{e}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{math|''V''*}}, the dual of {{math|''V''}}, has a basis {{math|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''}}&lt;/sup&gt; which obeys the rule
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^i (\mathbf{e}_j) = \delta^i_j.&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Kronecker delta]]. As

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(V,W) = V^* \otimes W&lt;/math&gt;
the row/column coordinates on a matrix correspond to the upper/lower indices on the tensor product.

== Common operations in this notation ==

In Einstein notation, the usual element reference {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for the {{math|''m''}}th row and {{math|''n''}}th column of matrix {{math|'''A'''}} becomes {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. We can then write the following operations in Einstein notation as follows.

;[[Inner product]] (hence also [[vector dot product]])

Using an [[orthogonal basis]], the inner product is the sum of corresponding components multiplied together:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_j v^j &lt;/math&gt;

This can also be calculated by multiplying the covector on the vector.

;[[Vector cross product]]

Again using an orthogonal basis (in 3 dimensions) the cross product intrinsically involves summations over permutations of components:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}= \varepsilon^i{}_{jk}u^j v^k \mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^i{}_{jk}=\delta^{il}\varepsilon_{ljk}&lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], and {{math|''δ&lt;sup&gt;il&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the generalized [[Kronecker delta]]. Based on this definition of {{math|''ε''}}, there is no difference between {{math|''ε&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} but the position of indices.

;Matrix-Vector Multiplication

The product of a matrix {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with a column vector {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is :

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_{i} = (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v})_{i}  =\sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} v_{j}&lt;/math&gt;

equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;u^i = A^i{}_j v^j &lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of matrix multiplication.

;[[Matrix multiplication]]

The [[Matrix multiplication#matrix product|matrix product]] of two matrices {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{ik} = (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B})_{ik}  =\sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} B_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;

equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;C^i{}_k = A^i{}_j B^j{}_k &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Trace (linear algebra)|Trace]]

For a square matrix {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, hence the sum over a common index {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

;[[Outer product]]

The outer product of the column vector {{math|''u&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} by the row vector {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} yields an {{math|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix {{math|'''A'''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;A^i{}_j = u^i v_j  = (u v)^i{}_j&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} represent two ''different'' indices, there is no summation and the indices are not eliminated by the multiplication.

;[[Raising and lowering indices]]

Given a tensor, one can raise an index or lower an index by contracting the tensor with the metric tensor, {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For example, take the tensor {{math|''T&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, one can raise an index:

&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\alpha} = g^{\mu\sigma} T_{\sigma}{}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Or one can lower an index:

&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\beta} = g_{\mu\sigma} T^{\sigma}{}_{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

==Notes==

#{{note label|a}}This applies only for numerical indices. The situation is the opposite for [[abstract indices]]. Then, vectors themselves carry upper abstract indices and covectors carry lower abstract indices, as per the example in the [[#Introduction|introduction]] of this article. Elements of a basis of vectors may carry a lower ''numerical'' index and an upper ''abstract'' index.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4430">In [[philosophy]] and [[modal logic]], '''epistemic possibility''' relates a statement under consideration to the current state of our [[knowledge]] about the [[actual world]]: a statement is said to be:

* ''epistemically possible'' if it ''may be true, for all we know''
* ''epistemically necessary'' if it is ''certain'' (or ''must be the case), given what we know''
* ''epistemically impossible'' if it ''cannot be true, given what we know'' 

Epistemic possibility is often contrasted with [[subjunctive possibility]] (or '''alethic possibility'''), and although epistemic and subjunctive possibilities are often expressed using the same modal terms (such as ''possibly'', ''could be'', ''must be'') or similar modal terms that are sometimes confused (such as ''may be'' and ''might be''), statements that are qualified in terms of epistemic possibility and statements that are qualified in terms of subjunctive possibility have importantly different meanings.

The contrast is best explained by example. Consider the two statements:

# [[Japan]] ''might have been'' victorious in [[World War II]]
# [[Japan]] ''may have been'' victorious in [[World War II]]

Although these two statements are often confused with one another, they mean two different things: the first says something ''true'' about the vagaries of war; the second says something that is certainly ''false''. The difference comes from the fact that the first statement—a statement of ''subjunctive'' possibility—says something about how things ''might have been'' under [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] conditions, whereas the second—a statement of ''epistemic'' possibility—says something about the relation between a particular outcome (a victory by Japan) and ''our knowledge about the actual world'' (since, as it happens, we know perfectly well that that particular outcome did ''not'' actually obtain, we know that what it says is false).

The parallel distinction arises between types of conditionals (if-then statements).  Consider the difference between the epistemic connection expressed by an [[indicative]] conditional and the causal or metaphysical relation expressed by a [[subjunctive]] conditional:

# If [[Lee Harvey Oswald|Oswald]] didn't shoot [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], someone else did
# If [[Lee Harvey Oswald|Oswald]] hadn't shot [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], someone else would have

The first statement says something that is certainly true, and will be accepted as such by anyone who is convinced that somebody shot Kennedy.  It's clearly true because it expresses this epistemic relation between its antecedent (the "if"-clause) and its consequent (the "then"-clause): The antecedent, if we came to know it was true, would provide us with excellent evidence that the consequent is true.  The second statement, on the other hand, expresses a causal or metaphysical relation: It says that the world was set up so that the consequent would have been made true if the antecedent were true.  One will accept that second statement to the extent that one thinks the world was set up in that way.  (Conspiracy theorists who think there was a back-up shooter, for instance, may accept the second statement.)  

Because of these differences, epistemic possibility bears on the actual world in ways that subjunctive possibility does not. Suppose, for example, that one wants to know whether or not to take an umbrella before going outside. If one is told "It's ''possible that'' it is raining outside"—in the sense of epistemic possibility—then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella. But if one is told that "It's ''possible for'' it to rain outside"—in the sense of ''metaphysical possibility''—then one is no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment.

An equichordal curve is a closed planar curve for which a point in the plane exists such that all [[Chord (geometry)|chords]] passing through this point are equal in length.&lt;ref name="equichordal-point"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the simplest construction is a [[circle]].

It has long only been conjectured that no convex equichordal curve with two equichordal points can exist. More generally, it was asked whether there exists a [[Jordan curve]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with two [[equichordal points]] &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that the curve

== Excentricity (or eccentricity) ==
Many results on equichordal curves refer to their excentricity. It turns out that the smaller the excentricity, the harder it is to disprove the existence of curves with two equichordal points. It can be shown rigorously that a small excentricity means that the curve must be close to the circle.&lt;ref name="Volkmer"/&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be the hypothetical [[convex function|convex]] [[curve]] with two [[equichordal points]] &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the common length of all chords of the curve &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; passing through &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then excentricity is the ratio

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{\|O_1-O_2\|}{L} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\|O_1-O_2\|&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the points &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;.

== The history of the problem ==
The problem has been extensively studied, with significant papers published over eight decades preceding its solution:
# In 1916 Fujiwara&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"&gt;M. Fujiwara. Über die Mittelkurve zweier geschlossenen konvexen Curven in Bezug auf einen Punkt. Tôhoku Math J., 10:99–103, 1916&lt;/ref&gt; proved that no convex curves with three equichordal points exist.
# In 1917 Blaschke, Rothe and Weitzenböck&lt;ref name="Blaschke"/&gt; formulated the problem again.
# In 1923 Süss showed certain symmetries and uniqueness of the curve, if it existed.
# In 1953 G. A. Dirac  showed some explicit bounds on the curve, if it existed.
# In 1958 Wirsing&lt;ref name="Wirsing"&gt;E. Wirsing, Zur Analytisität von Doppelspeichkurven, Arch. Math. 9 (1958), 300–307.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the curve, if it exists, must be an [[analytic curve]]. In this deep paper, he correctly identified the problem as [[perturbation problem beyond all orders]].
# In 1966 Ehrhart&lt;ref name="Erhhart"&gt;R. Ehrhart, Un ovale à deux points isocordes?, Enseignement Math. 13 (1967), 119–124&lt;/ref&gt; proved that there are no equichordal curves with excentricities&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.5.
# In 1988 Michelacci proved that  there are no equichordal curves with excentricities&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.33. The proof is mildly computer-assisted.
# In 1992 Schäfke and Volkmer&lt;ref name="Volkmer"&gt;R. Schäfke and H. Volkmer, Asymptotic analysis of the equichordal problem, J. Reine Angew. Math. 425 (1992), 9–60&lt;/ref&gt; showed that there is at most a finite number of values of excentricity for which the curve may exist. They outlined a feasible strategy for a computer-assisted proof. Their methods consists in obtaining extremely accurate approximations to the hypothetical curve.
# In 1996 Rychlik&lt;ref name="The_Proof"/&gt; fully solved the problem.

== Rychlik's proof ==
Marek Rychlik's proof was published in the hard to read article.&lt;ref name="The_Proof"/&gt;
There is also an easy to read, freely available on-line, research announcement article,&lt;ref name="The_Announcement"&gt;Marek Rychlik, The Equichordal Point Problem, Electronic Research Announcements of the AMS, 
1996, pages 108–123, available on-line at [http://www.ams.org/journals/era/1996-02-03/S1079-6762-96-00015-7/S1079-6762-96-00015-7.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but it only hints at the ideas used in the proof.

The proof does not use a computer. Instead it introduces a [[complexification]] of the original problem, and develops a generalization of the theory of [[Normally hyperbolic invariant manifold|normally hyperbolic invariant curves]] and [[stable manifold]]s to multi-valued maps &lt;math&gt;F:\mathbb{C}^2\to\mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;. This method allows the use of global methods of [[complex analysis]]. The prototypical global theorem is the [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]]. Another global theorem is [[Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry|Chow's theorem]]. The global method was used in the proof of [[Ushiki's Theorem]].&lt;ref name="Ushiki_Standard_Map_Theorem"&gt;S. Ushiki. Sur les liaisons-cols des systèmes dynamiques analytiques. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 291(7):447–449, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fundamentum Astronomiae''''' is a historic manuscript presented by [[Jost Bürgi]] to [[Emperor Rudolf II]]. in 1592. It describes Bürgi's [[trigonometry]] based [[algorithm]]s called [[Kunstweg]] which can be used to calculate [[sine]]s at arbitrary precision.&lt;ref name="staudacher"&gt;Staudacher, S., 2014.  Jost Bürgi, ''Kepler und der Kaiser''.  Verlag NZZ, Zürich.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
Bürgi took special care to avoid his method becoming public in his time. However, [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)]] (1561-1630) was acquainted with the method, likely via a link to [[John Dee]] who knew [[Christoph Rothmann]], a colleague of Bürgi at the court.&lt;ref name="folkerts"&gt;{{cite arxiv|authors=Menso Folkerts, Dieter Launert, Andreas Thom|year=2015|title=Jost Bürgi's Method for Calculating Sines|arxiv=1510.03180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
Bürgi used these algorithms, including multiplication table in [[sexagesimal]] system, to compute a ''[[Canon Sinuum (Bürgi)|Canon Sinuum]]'', a table of sines to 8 sexagesimal places in steps of 2 [[arc seconds]]. Such tables were extremely important for [[navigation]] at sea. Bürgi's method only uses additions and halving, his procedure is elementary and it converges from the standard method.&lt;ref name="folkerts"/&gt;

[[Johannes Kepler]] called the Canon Sinuum the most precise known table of sines.(reference???) The iterative algorithms obtains good [[approximations]] of sines after few iterations, but cannot be used on large subdivisions, because it produces very large values. This was an early step towards [[difference calculus]].&lt;ref name="folkerts"/&gt;

Ursus, his friend wrote in his 1588 ''Fundamentum astronomicum'', “I do not have to explain to which level of comprehensibility this extremely deep and nebulous theory has been corrected and improved by the tireless study of my dear teacher, Justus Bürgi from Switzerland, by assiduous considerations and daily thought. [...] Therefore neither I nor my dear teacher, the inventor and innovator of this hidden science, will ever regret the trouble and the labor which we have spent.”&lt;ref name="folkerts"/&gt;

Bürgi writes, “For many hundreds of years, up to now, our ancestors have been using this method because they were not able to invent a better one. However, this method is uncertain and dilapidated as well as cumbersome and laborious. Therefore we want to perform this in a different, better, more correct, easier and more cheerful way. And we want to point out now how all sines can be found without the troublesome inscription [of polygons], namely by dividing a right angle into as many parts as one desires.”&lt;ref name="folkerts"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5650">In [[mathematics]], the '''Gelfond–Schneider theorem''' establishes the [[transcendental number|transcendence]] of a large class of numbers. 
==History==
It was originally proved independently in 1934 by [[Aleksandr Gelfond]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aleksandr Gelfond |title=Sur le septième Problème de Hilbert |journal=Bulletin de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS. Classe des sciences mathématiques et na |volume=VII |issue=4 |pages=623–634 |year=1934 |url=http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/izv4924}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Theodor Schneider]]. 

==Statement==
:If ''a'' and ''b'' are [[algebraic number]]s with ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;1, and ''b'' [[Irrational number|irrational]], then any value of ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[transcendental number]].

===Comments===
* The values of ''a'' and ''b'' are not restricted to [[real number]]s; [[complex number]]s are allowed (they are never rational when they have an imaginary part not equal to 0, even if both the real and imaginary parts are rational).
* In general, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; = exp(''b'' log ''a'')}} is [[multivalued function|multivalued]], where "log" stands for the [[complex logarithm]]. This accounts for the phrase "any value of" in the theorem's statement.
* An equivalent formulation of the theorem is the following: if ''α'' and ''γ'' are nonzero algebraic numbers, and we take any non-zero logarithm of ''α'', then {{nowrap|(log ''γ'')/(log ''α'')}} is either rational or transcendental.  This may be expressed as saying that if {{nowrap|log ''α''}}, {{nowrap|log ''γ''}} are [[linear independence|linearly independent]] over the rationals, then they are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers.  The generalisation of this statement to more general [[linear forms in logarithms]] of several algebraic numbers is in the domain of [[transcendental number theory]].
* If the restriction that ''a'' and ''b'' be algebraic is removed, the statement does not remain true in general. For example,

::&lt;math&gt;{\left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)}^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

:Here, ''a'' is {{radic|2}}&lt;sup&gt;{{radic|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;, which (as proven by the theorem itself) is transcendental rather than algebraic. Similarly, if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 3}} and {{nowrap|1=''b'' = (log 2)/(log 3)}}, which is transcendental, then {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; = 2}} is algebraic. A characterization of the values for ''a'' and ''b'', which yield a transcendental ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, is not known.
* [[Kurt Mahler]] proved the [[P-adic number|''p''-adic]] analogue of the theorem: if ''a'' and ''b'' are in '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Complete metric space#Completion|completion]] of the [[algebraic closure]] of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, and they are algebraic over '''Q''', and if {{nowrap|{{abs|''a'' − 1}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 1}} and {{nowrap|{{abs|''b'' − 1}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 1}}, then {{nowrap|(log&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a'')/(log&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''b'')}} is either rational or transcendental, where log&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[P-adic exponential function#p-adic logarithm function|''p''-adic logarithm function]].

==Corollaries==
The transcendence of the following numbers follows immediately from the theorem:

* [[Gelfond–Schneider constant]] &lt;math&gt;2^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and its square root &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Gelfond's constant]] &lt;math&gt;e^{\pi} = \left( e^{i \pi} \right)^{-i} = (-1)^{-i} = 23.14069263 \ldots &lt;/math&gt;, as well as &lt;math&gt; i^i = \left( e^{i \pi / 2} \right)^i = e^{-\pi / 2} = 0.207879576 \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;
==Applications==

The Gelfond–Schneider theorem answers affirmatively [[Hilbert's seventh problem]].
==See also==
* [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]]
* [[Baker's theorem]]; an extension of the result
* [[Schanuel's conjecture]]; if proven it would imply both the Gelfond–Schneider theorem and the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem

'''Geometric graph theory''' in the broader sense is a large and amorph subfield of [[graph theory]], concerned with graphs defined by geometric means. In a stricter sense, geometric graph theory studies combinatorial and
geometric properties of geometric graphs, meaning graphs drawn in the Euclidean plane with possibly intersecting straight-line edges, and [[topological graph]]s, where the edges are allowed to be arbitrary continuous curves connecting the vertices, thus it is "the theory of geometric and topological graphs" (Pach 2013).

== Different types of geometric graphs ==
A ''[[planar straight line graph]]'' is a graph in which the vertices are embedded as points in the [[Euclidean plane]], and the edges are embedded as non-crossing [[line segment]]s.  [[Fáry's theorem]] states that any [[planar graph]] may be represented as a planar straight line graph. A [[Point set triangulation|triangulation]] is a planar straight line graph to which no more edges may be added, so called because every face is necessarily a triangle; a special case of this is the [[Delaunay triangulation]], a graph defined from a set of points in the plane by connecting two points with an edge whenever there exists a circle containing only those two points.

The 1-[[Skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of a [[polyhedron]] or [[polytope]] is the set of vertices and edges of the polytope. The skeleton of any convex polyhedron is a planar graph, and the skeleton of any ''k''-dimensional convex polytope is a [[K-vertex-connected graph|''k''-connected graph]]. Conversely, [[Steinitz's theorem]] states that any 3-connected planar graph is the skeleton of a convex polyhedron; for this reason, this class of graphs is also known as the [[polyhedral graph]]s.

A ''Euclidean graph'' is a graph in which the vertices represent points in the plane, and the edges are assigned lengths equal to the Euclidean distance between those points. The [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]] is the [[minimum spanning tree]] of a Euclidean [[complete graph]]. It is also possible to define graphs by conditions on the distances; in particular, a [[unit distance graph]] is formed by connecting pairs of points that are a unit distance apart in the plane. The [[Hadwiger–Nelson problem]] concerns the [[chromatic number]] of these graphs.

An [[intersection graph]] is a graph in which each vertex is associated with a set and in which vertices are connected by edges whenever the corresponding sets have a nonempty intersection. When the sets are geometric objects, the result is a geometric graph. For instance, the intersection graph of line segments in one dimension is an [[interval graph]]; the intersection graph of unit disks in the plane is a [[unit disk graph]]. The [[Circle packing theorem]] states that the intersection graphs of non-crossing circles are exactly the planar graphs. [[Scheinerman's conjecture]] (proven in 2009) states that every planar graph can be represented as the intersection graph of line segments in the plane.

A [[Levi graph]] of a family of points and lines has a vertex for each of these objects and an edge for every incident point-line pair. The Levi graphs of [[projective configuration]]s lead to many important [[symmetric graph]]s and [[cage (graph theory)|cages]].

The [[visibility graph]] of a closed polygon connects each pair of vertices by an edge whenever the line segment connecting the vertices lies entirely in the polygon. It is not known how to test efficiently whether an undirected graph can be represented as a visibility graph.

A [[partial cube]] is a graph for which the vertices can be associated with the vertices of a [[hypercube]], in such a way that distance in the graph equals [[Hamming distance]] between the corresponding hypercube vertices. Many important families of combinatorial structures, such as the acyclic orientations of a graph or the adjacencies between regions in a [[hyperplane arrangement]], can be represented as partial cube graphs. An important special case of a partial cube is the skeleton of the [[Truncated octahedron|permutohedron]], a graph in which vertices represent permutations of a set of ordered objects and edges represent swaps of objects adjacent in the order. Several other important classes of graphs including [[median graph]]s have related definitions involving metric embeddings {{Harv|Bandelt|Chepoi|2008|Ref=none}}.

A [[flip graph]] is a graph formed from the triangulations of a point set, in which each vertex represents a triangulation and two triangulations are connected by an edge if they differ by the replacement of one edge for another. It is also possible to define related flip graphs for partitions into quadrilaterals or pseudotriangles, and for higher-dimensional triangulations. The flip graph of triangulations of a convex polygon forms the skeleton of the [[associahedron]] or [[Stasheff polytope]]. The flip graph of the [[Point set triangulation#Regular triangulations|regular triangulations]] of a point set (projections of higher-dimensional convex hulls) can also be represented as a skeleton, of the so-called ''secondary polytope''.

'''Grady Booch''' (born February 27, 1955) is an American [[software engineer]], best known for developing the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) with [[Ivar Jacobson]] and [[James Rumbaugh]]. He is recognized internationally for his innovative work in software architecture, software engineering, and [[collaborative development environment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://se-radio.net/index.php?post_id=183380 |title=A podcast interview with Grady Booch on Software Engineering Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=577305 |title="The Promise, The Limits, The Beauty of Software" talk at Yahoo! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601175423/http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=577305 |archivedate=2007-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research.nsf/pages/r.plansoft.grady.booch.html |title=There is joy in software.

==Education==
Booch earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1977 from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] and a [[master's degree]] in electrical engineering in 1979 from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddj.com/java/197801612|title=Dr. Dobb's Excellence in Programming Award|date=2007-03-09|first=Michael|last=Swaine|authorlink=Michael Swaine (technical author)|publisher= Dr. Dobb's Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
Booch served as Chief Scientist of [[Rational Software|Rational Software Corporation]] since its founding in 1981 and through its acquisition by IBM in 2003, where he kept working until March 2008.  Afterwards, he became Chief Scientist, Software Engineering in IBM Research, and series editor for [[Benjamin Cummings]].

Booch has devoted his life's work to improving the art and the science of software development. In the 1980s, He wrote one of the more popular books on programming in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]. He is best known for developing the [[Unified Modeling Language]] with [[Ivar Jacobson]] and [[James Rumbaugh]] in the 1990s.

===IBM 1130===
Booch got his first exposure to programming on an [[IBM 1130]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/i-booch/ | title=Quote from interview: Grady Booch polishes his crystal ball | first=Grady |last=Booch | authorlink= | date=2003-04-03 | publisher=[[IBM]] |accessdate=2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...  I pounded the doors at the local IBM sales office until a salesman took pity on me. After we chatted for a while, he handed me a Fortran [manual]. I'm sure he gave it to me thinking, "I'll never hear from this kid again." I returned the following week saying, "This is really cool. I've read the whole thing and have written a small program. Where can I find a computer?" The fellow, to my delight, found me programming time on an IBM 1130 on weekends and late-evening hours. That was my first programming experience, and I must thank that anonymous IBM salesman for launching my career. Thank you, IBM.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Booch method===
[[File:Booch-diagram.png|thumb|250px|Class diagram]]
Booch developed the [[Booch method]] of software development, which he presents in his 1991/94 book, ''Object Oriented Analysis and Design''. He advises adding more classes to simplify complex code. The [[Booch method]] is a technique used in [[software engineering]]. It is an [[object modeling language]] and methodology that was widely used in [[object-oriented analysis and design]]. It was developed by Booch while at [[Rational Software]].

The notation aspect of the Booch method has now been superseded by the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the [[object-modeling technique]] (OMT) and [[object-oriented software engineering]] (OOSE).

Methodological aspects of the Booch method have been incorporated into several methodologies and processes, the primary such methodology being the [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP).

===Design patterns===
Booch is also an advocate of [[Design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]]s. For instance, he wrote the [[foreword]] to  ''[[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns]]'', an early and highly influential book in the field.

===IBM Research - Almaden===
He now is part of IBM Research - Almaden, serving as Chief Scientist for Software Engineering, where he continues his work on the Handbook of Software Architecture and also leads several projects in software engineering that are beyond the constraints of immediate product horizons. Grady continues to engage with customers working on real problems and maintains deep relationships with academia and other research organizations around the world. Grady is one of the original authors of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and was also one of the original developers of several of Rational's products. Grady has served as architect and architectural mentor for numerous complex software-intensive systems around the world in just about every domain imaginable.

===Publications===
Grady Booch published several articles and books. A selection:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16609">{{about|topological algebras associated to topological groups|the purely algebraic case (without any topology)|group ring}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''group algebra''' is any of various constructions to assign to a [[locally compact group]]  an [[operator algebra]] (or more generally a [[Banach algebra]]), such that representations of the algebra are related to representations of the group.  

As such, they are similar to the [[group ring]] associated to a discrete group. In particular, these all use convolution to extend the [[group Hopf algebra]] from the set of functions with finite support to more useful classes of functions.

== Group algebras of topological groups: ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'')==
For the purposes of [[functional analysis]], and in particular of [[harmonic analysis]], one wishes to carry over the group ring construction to [[topological group]]s ''G''. In case ''G'' is a [[locally compact group|locally compact Hausdorff group]], ''G'' carries an essentially unique left-invariant countably additive [[Borel measure]] μ called a [[Haar measure]].  Using the Haar measure, one can define a [[convolution]] operation on the space ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') of complex-valued continuous functions on ''G'' with [[compact support]]; ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') can then be given any of various [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s and the [[completeness (order theory)|completion]] will be a group algebra.

To define the convolution operation, let ''f'' and ''g'' be two functions in ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'').  For ''t'' in ''G'', define

:&lt;math&gt; [f * g](t) = \int_G f(s) g \left (s^{-1} t \right )\, d \mu(s).&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that ''f'' * ''g'' is continuous is immediate from the [[dominated convergence theorem]]. Also

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Support}(f * g) \subseteq \operatorname{Support}(f) \cdot \operatorname{Support}(g) &lt;/math&gt;

where the dot stands for the product in ''G''. ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') also has a natural [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;  f^*(s) = \overline{f(s^{-1})} \, \Delta(s^{-1}) &lt;/math&gt;

where Δ is the [[Haar measure#The modular function|modular function]] on ''G''.  With this involution, it is a [[*-algebra]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.''' With the norm:

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_1 := \int_G |f(s)| \, d\mu(s), &lt;/math&gt;

''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') becomes an involutive [[normed algebra]] with an [[approximate identity]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The approximate identity can be indexed on a neighborhood basis of the identity consisting of compact sets.  Indeed, if ''V'' is a compact neighborhood of the identity, let ''f&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' be a non-negative continuous function supported in ''V'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_V f_{V}(g)\, d \mu(g) =1.&lt;/math&gt;

Then {''f&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; is an approximate identity. A group algebra has an identity, as opposed to just an approximate identity, if and only if the topology on the group is the [[discrete topology]].

Note that for discrete groups, ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') is the same thing as the complex group ring '''C'''[''G''].

The importance of the group algebra is that it captures the [[unitary representation]] theory of ''G'' as shown in the following

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.''' Let ''G'' be a locally compact group.  If ''U'' is a strongly continuous unitary representation of ''G'' on a Hilbert space ''H'', then

: &lt;math&gt; \pi_U (f) = \int_G f(g) U(g)\, d \mu(g)&lt;/math&gt;

is a non-degenerate bounded *-representation of the normed algebra ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'').  The map

: &lt;math&gt; U \mapsto \pi_U&lt;/math&gt;

is a bijection between the set of strongly continuous unitary representations of ''G'' and non-degenerate bounded *-representations of ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'').  This bijection respects unitary equivalence and [[strong containment]]. In particular, π&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; is irreducible if and only if ''U'' is irreducible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Non-degeneracy of a representation π of ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') on a Hilbert space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt;  means that

:&lt;math&gt; \left \{\pi(f) \xi : f \in \operatorname{C}_c(G), \xi \in H_\pi \right \} &lt;/math&gt;

is dense in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt;.

== The convolution algebra ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') ==
It is a standard theorem of [[measure theory]] that the completion of ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') in the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') norm is isomorphic to the space [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'')]] of equivalence classes of functions which are integrable with respect to the [[Haar measure]], where, as usual, two functions are regarded as equivalent if and only if they differ only on a set of Haar measure zero.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.''' ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') is a [[Banach *-algebra]] with the convolution product and involution defined above and with the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm.  ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') also has a bounded approximate identity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The group C*-algebra ''C*''(''G'') ==
Let  '''C'''[''G''] be the [[group ring]] of a [[discrete group]] ''G''.

For a locally compact group ''G'', the group [[C*-algebra]] ''C*''(''G'') of ''G'' is defined to be the C*-enveloping algebra of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''), i.e. the completion of ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') with respect to the largest C*-norm:

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_{C^*} := \sup_\pi \|\pi(f)\|,&lt;/math&gt;

where π ranges over all non-degenerate *-representations of ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') on Hilbert spaces. When ''G'' is discrete, it follows from the triangle inequality that, for any such π, one has:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\pi (f)\| \leq \| f \|_1,&lt;/math&gt;

hence the norm is well-defined.

It follows from the definition that ''C*''(''G'') has the following [[universal property]]: any *-homomorphism from '''C'''[''G''] to some  '''B'''(''H'') (the C*-algebra of [[bounded operator]]s on some [[Hilbert space]] ''H'') factors through the [[inclusion map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}[G] \hookrightarrow C^*_{\max}(G).&lt;/math&gt;

=== The reduced group C*-algebra ''C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;*''(''G'') ===
The reduced group C*-algebra ''C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;*''(''G'') is the completion of ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') with respect to the norm

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_{C^*_r} := \sup \left \{ \|f*g\|_2: \|g\|_2 = 1 \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_2 = \sqrt{\int_G |f|^2 \, d\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

is the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm.  Since the completion of ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') with regard to the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm is a Hilbert space, the ''C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;*'' norm is the norm of the bounded operator acting on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') by convolution with ''f'' and thus a C*-norm.

Equivalently, ''C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;*''(''G'') is the C*-algebra generated by the image of the left regular representation on ''ℓ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'').

In general, ''C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;*''(''G'') is a quotient of ''C*''(''G''). The reduced group C*-algebra is isomorphic to the non-reduced group C*-algebra defined above if and only if ''G'' is [[Amenable group|amenable]].

== von Neumann algebras associated to groups ==
The group von Neumann algebra ''W*''(''G'') of ''G'' is the enveloping von Neumann algebra of ''C*''(''G'').

For a discrete group ''G'', we can consider the [[Hilbert space]] ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') for which ''G'' is an [[orthonormal basis]].  Since ''G'' operates on ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') by permuting the basis vectors, we can identify the complex group ring '''C'''[''G''] with a subalgebra of the algebra of [[bounded operator]]s on ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'').  The weak closure of this subalgebra, ''NG'', is a [[von Neumann algebra]].

The center of ''NG'' can be described in terms of those elements of ''G'' whose [[conjugacy class]] is finite.  In particular, if the identity element of ''G'' is the only group element with that property (that is, ''G'' has the [[infinite conjugacy class property]]), the center of ''NG'' consists only of complex multiples of the identity.

''NG'' is isomorphic to the [[hyperfinite type II-1 factor|hyperfinite type II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; factor]] if and only if ''G'' is [[countable]], [[Amenable group|amenable]], and has the infinite conjugacy class property.

== Stereotype group algebras ==

In [[Stereotype space|stereotype theory]] there is a series of natural group algebras that includes the following four main examples.

* On each locally compact group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; one can consider the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}(G)&lt;/math&gt; of all continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f:G\to{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt; with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets &lt;math&gt;T\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Stereotype space#Definition|stereotype dual space]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, which consists of [[Radon measure]]s with compact support on a [[locally compact group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[stereotype algebra]] with respect to the operation of [[convolution#Convolution of measures|convolution]]:{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=272}} &lt;math&gt;
\alpha * \beta (f)=
\int_G \left( \int_G f(s\cdot t)\, \alpha(ds) \right) \beta(dt), \quad \alpha,\beta\in {\mathcal C}^\star(G), \ f\in {\mathcal C}(G).
&lt;/math&gt; 
: The algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''stereotype group algebra of measures'' on the locally compact group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is an infinite locally compact group then the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of measures on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[Fréchet algebra]]. In the case when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is compact, &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Smith space]]. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact, then &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Brauner space]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* On each [[real Lie group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; one can consider the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}(G)&lt;/math&gt; of all smooth functions &lt;math&gt;f:G\to{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt; with the  topology of uniform convergence with all derivatives on compact sets &lt;math&gt;T\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Stereotype space#Definition|stereotype dual space]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, which consists of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s with compact support on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[stereotype algebra]] with respect to the operation of convolution of distributions. The algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''stereotype group algebra of distributions'' on the real Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Stereotype space#Definition|stereotype dual space]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, which consists of holomorphic fuhctionals on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[stereotype algebra]] with respect to the operation of convolution of functionals. The algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''stereotype group algebra of analytic functionals'' on the Stein group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

* On each [[affine algebraic group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; one can consider the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}(G)&lt;/math&gt; of all polynomials (or regular functions) &lt;math&gt;f:G\to{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt; with the strongest locally convex topology. The [[Stereotype space#Definition|stereotype dual space]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, which consists of currents on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[stereotype algebra]] with respect to the operation of convolution of currents. The algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''stereotype group algebra of currents'' on the affine algebraic group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

A map &lt;math&gt;\pi:G\to A&lt;/math&gt; of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; into an associative unital algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'', if it is a group homomorphism into the group of invertible elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. if it satisfies the following identities:

&lt;math&gt;\pi(1_G)=1_A, \qquad \pi(x\cdot y)=\pi(x)\cdot\pi(y),
\qquad x,y\in G.&lt;/math&gt;

The representation &lt;math&gt;\delta: G\to {\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta(x)(u)=u(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u\in {\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''representation as delta-functionals''.

The representations &lt;math&gt;\delta: G\to {\mathcal E}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta: G\to {\mathcal O}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta: G\to {\mathcal P}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, are defined similarly.

The following two results distinguish the stereotype group algebras among the other models of group algebras in analysis.

'''Henry Bickersteth, 1st Baron Langdale''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (18 June 1783 – 18 April 1851) was an English law reformer and [[Master of the Rolls]].

==Life==
He was born on 18 June 1783 at [[Kirkby Lonsdale]], three years before his brother [[Edward Bickersteth (1786–1850)|Edward Bickersteth]].{{sfn|Barker|1886}}

By the advice of his uncle, Dr. [[Robert Batty (physician)|Robert Batty]], in October 1801, he went to Edinburgh to pursue his medical studies, and in the following year was called home to take his father's practice in his temporary absence. 
Disliking the idea of settling down in the country as a general practitioner, young Bickersteth determined to become a London physician. 
With a view to obtaining a medical degree, on 22 June 1802 his name was entered in the books of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], and, on 27 October in the same year, he was elected a scholar on the Hewitt foundation. 
Owing to his intense application to work, his health broke down after his first term.{{sfn|Barker|1886}}

A change of scene being deemed necessary to insure his recovery, he obtained, through Dr. Batty, the post of medical attendant to [[Edward Harley, 5th Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Edward, fifth earl of Oxford]], who was then on a tour in Italy. After his return from the continent he continued with the Earl of Oxford until 1805, when he returned to Cambridge. At this time he wanted to enter the army, but his parents disapproved. After three years he was senior [[Smith's mathematical prize]]man of his year (1808), [[Miles Bland]], [[Charles James Blomfield]] and [[Adam Sedgwick]] being among the competitors. He graduated [[senior wrangler]] from [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] in 1808 and after training as a physician like his father, he turned to law.{{sfn|Barker|1886}}

Having taken his degree, Bickersteth was immediately elected a fellow of his college, and thereupon made up his mind to enter the profession of the law. On 8 April 1808, he was admitted to the [[Inner Temple]] as a student, and, in the beginning of 1810, became a pupil of [[John Bell (barrister)|John Bell]], and was called to the [[barrister|Bar]] on 22 November 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BKRT802H|name=Bickersteth, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bickersteth became a [[King's Counsel]] in 1827, and 1836 brought him membership of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], appointment as Master of the Rolls and a peerage, which he accepted on condition that he could concentrate on law reform and remain politically independent.{{sfn|Barker|1886}} He was created Baron Langdale, of Langdale in the County of Westmoreland on 23 January 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=19348 |date=19 January 1836 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was determined that the government should provide an adequate [[Public Record Office]] and became known as the "father of record reform". As Master of the Rolls he was in effect Keeper of The Public Records. After the Public Records Act of 1838, he and his Deputy Keeper, [[Francis Palgrave]], the full-time working head of the office, started to organise the transfer of state papers from the [[Tower of London]], the [[chapter house]] of [[Westminster Abbey]] and elsewhere, to one single location.{{sfn|Barker|1886}}

In 1850, ill health forced him to turn down the chance to become [[Lord Chancellor]] and he died the following year, on 18 April 1851, at [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]].{{sfn|Barker|1886}}

==Family==
[[File:Brampton Bryan Hall (geograph 3907060).jpg|thumb|Brampton Bryan Hall and Castle]]
He married Lady Jane Elizabeth Harley, daughter of his patron the [[Edward Harley, 5th Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|5th Earl of Oxford]] by licence on 17 August 1835, in St. James, Paddington, London. They had one daughter, Jane Frances, christened 12 March 1837, in London.{{sfn|Barker|1886}} 

In 1853, on the death of his wife's brother, the [[Alfred Harley, 6th Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|6th Earl of Oxford]], they inherited the family seat of [[Brampton Bryan Castle|Brampton Bryan]] in Herefordshire. On his wife's death in 1872 it passed to a distant relative, William Daker Harley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3739">In [[differential topology]], an area of [[mathematics]], the '''Hirzebruch signature theorem'''&lt;ref name="H1" /&gt; (sometimes called the Hirzebruch index theorem)
is [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]]'s 1954 result expressing the [[signature (topology)|signature]] 
of a smooth compact oriented manifold by a linear combination of [[Pontryagin number]]s called the 
[[Genus_of_a_multiplicative_sequence#L genus|L-genus]].
It was used in the proof of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]].

==Statement of the theorem==
The L-genus is the [[Genus_of_a_multiplicative_sequence|genus for the multiplicative sequence of polynomials]]
associated to the characteristic power series
:&lt;math&gt;{x\over \tanh(x)} = \sum_{k\ge 0} {{2^{2k}B_{2k}\over (2k)!}x^{2k}}
 = 1 + {x^2 \over 3} - {x^4 \over 45} +\cdots .&lt;/math&gt;
The first two of the resulting L-polynomials are:
*&lt;math&gt;L_1 = \tfrac13 p_1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;L_2 = \tfrac1{45}(7p_2 - p_1^2)&lt;/math&gt;
By taking for the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; the Pontryagin classes &lt;math&gt;p_i(M)&lt;/math&gt; of the tangent bundle of a 4''n'' dimensional smooth compact and oriented
manifold M one obtains the L-classes of M.
Hirzebruch showed that the n-th L-class of M evaluated on the [[fundamental class]] of M, &lt;math&gt;[M]&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to &lt;math&gt;\sigma(M)&lt;/math&gt;, the signature of M 
(i.e. the signature of the intersection form on the 2''n''th cohomology group of M ):
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(M) = \langle L_n(p_1(M), \dots, p_n(M)), [M]\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

==Sketch of proof of the signature theorem==
[[René Thom]] had earlier proved that the signature was given by some linear combination of [[Pontryagin number]]s, and Hirzebruch found the exact formula for this linear combination 
by introducing the notion of the genus of a multiplicative sequence. 

Since the rational [[Cobordism#Oriented cobordism|oriented cobordism ring]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega_*^{\text{SO}}\otimes \Q&lt;/math&gt; is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_*^{\text{SO}}\otimes \Q =\Q [\mathbb{P}^{2}(\Complex), \mathbb{P}^{4}(\Complex), \ldots ],&lt;/math&gt;
the polynomial algebra generated by the oriented cobordism classes 
&lt;math&gt;[\mathbb{P}^{2i}(\Complex)]&lt;/math&gt; of the even dimensional [[complex projective space]]s,
it is enough to verify that
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(\mathbb{P}^{2i})= 1 = \langle L_i(p_1(\mathbb{P}^{2i}), \ldots, p_n(\mathbb{P}^{2i})), [\mathbb{P}^{2i}]\rangle &lt;/math&gt; 
for all i.

==Generalizations==
The signature theorem is a special case of the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]] for
the [[signature operator]].
The analytic index of the signature operator equals the signature of the manifold, and its topological index is the L-genus of the manifold.
By the Atiyah–Singer index theorem these are equal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41734">'''Independence-friendly logic''' ('''IF logic'''), proposed by [[Jaakko Hintikka]] and [[Gabriel Sandu (philosopher)|Gabriel Sandu]] in 1989 (&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHinSan1989|Hintikka&amp;Sandu1989]]&lt;/ref&gt;), is an extension of classical [[first-order logic]] (FOL) by means of slashed quantifiers of the form &lt;math&gt;(\exists v/V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\forall v/V)&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; being a finite set of variables). The intended reading of &lt;math&gt;(\exists v/V)&lt;/math&gt; is "there is a &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; which is functionally independent from the variables in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;". IF logic allows one to express more general patterns of dependence between variables than those which are implicit in first-order logic. This greater level of generality leads to an actual increase in expressive power; the set of IF sentences can characterize the same classes of structures as [[existential second-order logic]] (&lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt;). For example, it can express [[branching quantifier]] sentences, such as the formula &lt;math&gt;\exists c\forall x\exists y\forall z(\exists w/\{x,y\})((x=z \leftrightarrow y=w) \land y \neq c)&lt;/math&gt;  which expresses infinity in the empty signature; this cannot be done in FOL.  Therefore, first-order logic cannot, in general, express this pattern of dependency, in which &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; depends ''only'' on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; depends ''only'' on &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. IF logic is more general than [[branching quantifier]]s, for example in that it can express dependencies that are not transitive, such as in the quantifier prefix &lt;math&gt;\forall x\exists y(\exists z/\{x\})&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;).

The introduction of IF logic was partly motivated by the attempt of extending the [[game-theoretical semantics]] of first-order logic to games of [[imperfect information]]. Indeed, a semantics for IF sentences can be given in terms of these kinds of games (or, alternatively, by means of a translation procedure to existential second-order logic). A semantics for open formulas cannot be given in the form of a Tarskian semantics (&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCamHod2001|Cameron&amp;Hodges 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;); an adequate semantics must specify what it means for a formula to be satisfied by a set of assignments of common variable domain (a ''team'') rather than satisfaction by a single assignment. Such a ''team semantics'' was developed by [[Wilfrid Hodges|Hodges]] (&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHod97|Hodges 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

IF logic is translation equivalent, at the level of sentences, with a number of other logical systems based on team semantics, such as [[dependence logic]], [[dependence-friendly logic]], [[exclusion logic]] and [[independence logic]]; with the exception of the latter, IF logic is known to be equiexpressive to these logics also at the level of open formulas. However, IF logic differs from all the above-mentioned systems in that it lacks ''locality'' (the meaning of an open formula cannot be described just in terms of the free variables of the formula; it is instead dependent on the context in which the formula occurs).

IF logic shares a number of metalogical properties with first-order logic, but there are some differences, including lack of closure under (classical, contradictory) negation and higher complexity for deciding the validity of formulas. Extended IF logic addresses the closure problem, but its game-theoretical semantics is more complicated, and such logic corresponds to a larger fragment of second-order logic, a proper subset of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^1&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFigGorGri2011|Figueira, Gorin &amp; Grimson 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Hintikka has argued (e.g. in the book &lt;ref&gt;[[#refHin1996|Hintikka 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;) that IF and extended IF logic should be used as a basis for the [[foundations of mathematics]]; this proposal has been met in some cases with skepticism (see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFef2006|Feferman2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Syntax ==

A number of slightly different presentations of IF logic have appeared in the literature; here we follow.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refManSanSev2011|Mann, Sandu &amp; Sevenster 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms and atomic formulas===
Terms and atomic formulas are defined exactly as in [[First-order logic|first-order logic with equality]].

===IF formulas===

For a fixed signature σ, formulas of IF logic are defined as follows:

# Any atomic formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is an IF formula.
# If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is an IF formula, then &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is an IF formula. 
# If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are IF formulas, then &lt;math&gt;\phi \wedge \psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi \vee \psi&lt;/math&gt; are IF formulas.
# If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a variable, and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of variables, then &lt;math&gt;(\exists v/V)\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\forall v/V)\varphi&lt;/math&gt; are also IF formulas.

===Free variables===

The set &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Free}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; of the free variables of an IF formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is defined inductively as follows:
 
# If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is an atomic formula, then &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Free}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all variables occurring in it. 
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Free}(\lnot\varphi) = \mbox{Free}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Free}(\varphi \vee \psi) = \mbox{Free}(\varphi) \cup \mbox{Free}(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Free}((\exists v/V)\varphi) = \mbox{Free}((\forall v/V)\varphi) = (\mbox{Free}(\varphi) \backslash \{v\})\cup V&lt;/math&gt;.

The last clause is the only one that differs from the clauses for first-order logic, the difference being that also the variables in the slash set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are counted as free variables.

===IF Sentences===

An IF formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Free}(\phi) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; is an ''IF sentence''.

== Semantics ==

Three main approaches have been proposed for the definition of the semantics of IF logic. The first two, based respectively on games of imperfect information and on Skolemization, are mainly used in the definition of IF sentences only. The former generalizes a similar approach, for first-order logic, which was based instead on games of ''perfect'' information.
The third approach, ''team semantics'', is a compositional semantics in the spirit of Tarskian semantics. However, this semantics does not define what it means for a formula to be satisfied by an assignment (rather, by a ''set'' of assignments).
The first two approaches were developed in earlier publications on if logic (&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHinSan1989|Hintikka&amp;Sandu 1989]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSan1993|Sandu 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;); the third one by Hodges in 1997 (&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHod97|Hodges 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHod1997b|Hodges 1997b]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

In this section, we differentiate the three approaches by writing distinct pedices, as in &lt;math&gt;\models_{GTS},\models_{Sk},\models&lt;/math&gt;. Since the three approaches are fundamentally equivalent, only the symbol &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; will be used in the rest of the article.

=== Game-Theoretical Semantics ===

Game-Theoretical Semantics assigns truth values to IF sentences according to the properties of some 2-player games of imperfect information. 
For ease of presentation, it is convenient to associate games not only to sentences, but also to formulas. More precisely, one defines games &lt;math&gt;G(\varphi, \mathcal M, s)&lt;/math&gt; for each triple formed by an IF formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;, and an assignment &lt;math&gt;s:U\supseteq \mbox{Free}(\varphi)\rightarrow \mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Players ====

The semantic game &lt;math&gt;G(\varphi, \mathcal M, s)&lt;/math&gt; has two players, called Eloise (or Verifier) and Abelard (or Falsifier).

==== Game rules ====

The allowed moves in the semantic game &lt;math&gt;G(\varphi,\mathcal M,s)&lt;/math&gt; are determined by the synctactical structure of the formula under consideration.
For simplicity, we first assume that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is in negation normal form, with negations symbols occurring only in front of atomic subformulas.

# If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a literal, the game ends, and, if &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; (in the first-order sense), then Eloise wins; otherwise, Abelard wins.
# If &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\psi_1\land\psi_2&lt;/math&gt;, then Abelard chooses one of the subformulas &lt;math&gt;\psi_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding game &lt;math&gt;G(\psi_i,\mathcal M,s)&lt;/math&gt; is played. 
# If &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\psi_1\lor\psi_2&lt;/math&gt;, then Eloises chooses one of the subformulas &lt;math&gt;\psi_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding game &lt;math&gt;G(\psi_i,\mathcal M,s)&lt;/math&gt; is played. 
# If &lt;math&gt;\varphi=(\forall v/V)\psi&lt;/math&gt;, then Abelard chooses an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;, and game &lt;math&gt;G(\psi,\mathcal M,s(a/v))&lt;/math&gt; is played.
# If &lt;math&gt;\varphi=(\exists v/V)\psi&lt;/math&gt;, then Eloise chooses an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;, and game &lt;math&gt;G(\psi,\mathcal M,s(a/v))&lt;/math&gt; is played.

More generally, if &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is not in negation normal form, we can state, as a rule for negation, that, when a game &lt;math&gt;G(\lnot\varphi,\mathcal M,s)&lt;/math&gt; is reached, the players begin playing a dual game &lt;math&gt;G^*(\varphi,\mathcal M,s)&lt;/math&gt; in which the roles of Verifiers and Falsifier are switched.

==== Histories ====
Informally, a sequence of moves in a game &lt;math&gt;G(\varphi,\mathcal M,s)&lt;/math&gt; is a history. At the end of each history &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, some subgame &lt;math&gt;G(\psi_h,\mathcal M,s_h)&lt;/math&gt; is played; we call &lt;math&gt;s_h&lt;/math&gt; the ''assignment associated to'' &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\psi_h&lt;/math&gt; the ''subformula occurrence associated to'' &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. The ''player associated to'' &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is Eloise in case the most external logical operator in &lt;math&gt;\psi_h&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, and Abelard in case it is &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;.

The set &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; of ''allowed moves'' in a history &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; if the most external operator of &lt;math&gt;\psi_h&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;; it is &lt;math&gt;\{L,R\}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;L,R&lt;/math&gt; being any two distinct objects, symbolizing 'left' and 'right') in case the most external operator of &lt;math&gt;\psi_h&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;.

Given two assignments &lt;math&gt;s,t&lt;/math&gt; of same domain, and &lt;math&gt;V\subseteq dom(s)&lt;/math&gt; we write &lt;math&gt;s\sim_V t&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s(w) = t(w)&lt;/math&gt; on any variable &lt;math&gt;w\in dom(s)\setminus V&lt;/math&gt;.

Imperfect information is introduced in the games by stipulating that certain histories are indistinguishable for the associated player; indistinguishable histories are said to form an 'information set'. Intuitively, if the history &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is in the information set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, the player associated to &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; does not know whether he is in &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; or in some other history of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.
Consider two histories &lt;math&gt;h,h'&lt;/math&gt; such that the associated &lt;math&gt;\psi_h,\psi_{h'}&lt;/math&gt; are identical subformula occurrences of the form &lt;math&gt;(Qv/V)\chi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;Q = \exists&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;); if furthermore &lt;math&gt;s_h\sim_V s_{h'}&lt;/math&gt;, we write &lt;math&gt;h\sim_\exists h'&lt;/math&gt; (in case &lt;math&gt;Q = \exists&lt;/math&gt;) or &lt;math&gt;h\sim_\forall h'&lt;/math&gt; (in case &lt;math&gt;Q = \forall&lt;/math&gt;), in order to specify that the two histories are indistinguishable for Eloise, resp. for Abelard. We also stipulate, in general, reflexivity of this relation: if &lt;math&gt;\psi =\chi_1\lor\chi_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;h\sim_\exists h'&lt;/math&gt;; and if &lt;math&gt;\psi =\chi_1\land\chi_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;h\sim_\forall h'&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Strategies ====

For a fixed game &lt;math&gt;G(\varphi,\mathcal M,s)&lt;/math&gt;, write &lt;math&gt;H_\exists&lt;/math&gt; for the set of histories to which Eloise is associated, and similarly &lt;math&gt;H_\forall&lt;/math&gt; for the set of histories of Abelard.

A ''strategy'' for Eloise in the game &lt;math&gt;G(\varphi,\mathcal M,s)&lt;/math&gt; is any function that assigns, to any possible history in which it is Eloise's turn to play, a legal move; more precisely, any function &lt;math&gt;\sigma: H_\exists \rightarrow \prod_{h\in H_\exists}A(h)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(h)\in A(h)&lt;/math&gt; for every history &lt;math&gt;h\in H_\exists&lt;/math&gt;. One can define dually the strategies of Abelard.

A strategy for Eloise is ''uniform'' if, whenever &lt;math&gt;h\sim_\exists h'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma(h) = \sigma(h')&lt;/math&gt;; for Abelard, if &lt;math&gt;h\sim_\forall h'&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\sigma(h) = \sigma(h')&lt;/math&gt;.

A strategy &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for Eloise is ''winning'' if Eloise wins in each terminal history that can be reached by playing according to &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly for Abelard.

==== Truth, falsity, indeterminacy ====

An IF sentence &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is ''true'' in a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models_{GTS}^+\varphi&lt;/math&gt;) if Eloise has a uniform winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;G(\varphi, \mathcal M, \emptyset)&lt;/math&gt;. 
It is ''false'' (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models_{GTS}^-\varphi&lt;/math&gt;) if Abelard has a winning strategy.
It is ''undetermined'' if neither Eloise nor Abelard has a winning strategy.

==== Conservativity ====

The semantics of IF logic thus defined is a conservative extension of first-order semantics, in the following sense. If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is an IF sentence with empty slash sets, associate to it the first-order formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi'&lt;/math&gt; which is identical to it, except in that each IF quantifier &lt;math&gt;(Qv/\emptyset)&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the corresponding first-order quantifier &lt;math&gt;Qv&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models_{GTS}^+\varphi&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models\varphi'&lt;/math&gt; in the Tarskian sense; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models_{GTS}^-\varphi&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\not\models\varphi'&lt;/math&gt; in the Tarskian sense.

==== Open formulas ====

More general games can be used to assign a meaning to (possibly open) IF formulas; more exactly, it is possible to define what it means for an IF formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; to be satisfied, on a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;, by a ''team'' &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (a set of assignments of common variable domain &lt;math&gt;dom(X)&lt;/math&gt; and codomain &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;).
The associated games &lt;math&gt;G(\varphi,M,X)&lt;/math&gt; begin with the random choice of an assignment &lt;math&gt;s\in X&lt;/math&gt;; after this initial move, the game 
&lt;math&gt;G(\varphi,M,s)&lt;/math&gt; is played. The existence of a winning strategy for Eloise defines ''positive satisfaction'' (&lt;math&gt;M,X\models_{GTS}^+\varphi&lt;/math&gt;), and existence of a winning strategy for Abelard defines ''negative satisfaction'' (&lt;math&gt;M,X\models_{GTS}^-\varphi&lt;/math&gt;).
At this level of generality, Game-theoretical Semantics can be replaced by an algebraic approach, ''team semantics'' (defined below).

=== Skolem Semantics ===

A definition of truth for IF sentences can be given, alternatively, by means of a translation into existential second-order logic. The translation generalizes the Skolemization procedure of first-order logic. Falsity is defined by a dual procedure called Kreiselization.

==== Skolemization ====

Given an IF formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, we first define its skolemization relativized to a finite set &lt;math&gt;U\supseteq \mbox{Free}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; of variables. For every existential quantifier &lt;math&gt;(\exists v/V)&lt;/math&gt; occurring in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;f_v&lt;/math&gt; be a new function symbol (a "Skolem function"). We write &lt;math&gt;Subst(\varphi,v,t)&lt;/math&gt; for the formula which is obtained substituting, in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, all free occurrences of the variable &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with the term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The Skolemization of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; relative to &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Sk}_U(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by the following inductive clauses:

#&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sk}_{U}(\varphi )= \varphi &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a literal.  
#&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sk}_{U}(\psi \circ \chi)=\operatorname{Sk}_{U}(\psi )\circ \operatorname{Sk}_{U}(\chi)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\circ = \land,\lor&lt;/math&gt;. 
#&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sk}_{U}((\forall v/V)\psi )=\forall v\operatorname{Sk}_{U\cup \{v\}}(\psi )&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sk}_{U}((\exists v/V)\psi )=Sub(\operatorname{Sk}_{U\cup \{v\}}(\psi ),v,f_v(y_{1},...,y_{n}))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y_{1},...,y_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a list of the variables in &lt;math&gt;U\setminus V&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is an IF sentence, its (unrelativized) Skolemization is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Sk}(\varphi) = \mbox{Sk}_\varnothing(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Kreiselization ====

Given an IF formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, associate, to each universal quantifier &lt;math&gt;(\forall v/V)&lt;/math&gt; occurring in it, a new function symbol &lt;math&gt;g_v&lt;/math&gt; (a "Kreisel function"). Then, the Kreiselization &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Kr}_U(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; relative to a finite set of variables &lt;math&gt;U\supseteq\mbox{Free}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by the following inductive clauses:

#&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Kr}_{U}(\varphi )= \lnot\varphi &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a literal.  
#&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Kr}_{U}(\psi \land \chi)=\operatorname{Kr}_{U}(\psi )\lor \operatorname{Kr}_{U}(\chi)&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Kr}_{U}(\psi \lor \chi)=\operatorname{Kr}_{U}(\psi )\land \operatorname{Kr}_{U}(\chi)&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Kr}_{U}((\forall v/V)\psi )=Sub(\operatorname{Kr}_{U\cup \{v\}}(\psi ),v,g_v(y_{1},...,y_{n}))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y_{1},...,y_{n}&lt;/math&gt;is a list of the variables in &lt;math&gt;U\setminus V&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Kr}_{U}((\exists v/V)\psi )=\forall v\operatorname{Kr}_{U\cup \{v\}}(\psi )&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is an IF sentence, its (unrelativized) Kreiselization is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Kr}(\varphi) = \mbox{Kr}_\varnothing(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Truth, falsity, indeterminacy ====

Given an IF sentence &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; existential quantifiers, a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;, and a list &lt;math&gt;\vec f&lt;/math&gt;of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; functions of appropriate arities, we denote as &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal M,\vec f)&lt;/math&gt; the expansion of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; which assigns the functions &lt;math&gt;\vec f&lt;/math&gt; as interpretations for the Skolem functions of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

An IF sentence is true on a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models_{\mbox{Sk}}^+\varphi&lt;/math&gt;) iff there is a tuple &lt;math&gt;\vec f&lt;/math&gt; of functions such that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal M,\vec f)\models \mbox{Sk}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.
Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models_{\mbox{Sk}}^-\varphi&lt;/math&gt; iff there is a tuple &lt;math&gt;\vec f&lt;/math&gt; of functions such that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal M,\vec f)\models \mbox{Kr}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models_{\mbox{Sk}}^0\varphi&lt;/math&gt; iff neither of the previous conditions holds.

For any IF sentence, Skolem Semantics returns the same values as Game-theoretical Semantics.

=== Team Semantics ===

By means of team semantics, it is possible to give a compositional account of the semantics of IF logic. Truth and falsity are grounded on the notion of 'satisfiability of a formula by a team'.

==== Teams ====

Let  &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M &lt;/math&gt; be a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] and let &lt;math&gt;V = \{v_1 \ldots v_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of variables. Then a team over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; with domain &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a set of assignments over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; with domain &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, that is, a set of functions &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Duplicating and supplementing teams ====

Duplicating and supplementing are two operations on teams which are related to the semantics of universal and existential quantification.

#Given a team &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; and a variable &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, the duplicating team &lt;math&gt;X[\mathcal M/v]&lt;/math&gt; is the team &lt;math&gt;\{s(a/v)|s\in X, a\in \mathcal M\}&lt;/math&gt;.

#Given a team &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;, a function &lt;math&gt;F:X\rightarrow \mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; and a variable &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, the supplementing team &lt;math&gt;X[F/v]&lt;/math&gt; is the team &lt;math&gt;\{s(F(s)/v)|s\in X\}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is customary to replace repeated applications of these two operation with more succinct notations, such as &lt;math&gt;X[\mathcal MF/uv]&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;(X[\mathcal M/u])[F/v]&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Uniform functions on teams ====

As above, given two assignments &lt;math&gt;s,t&lt;/math&gt; with same variable domain, we write &lt;math&gt;s\sim_V t&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s(w) = t(w)&lt;/math&gt; for every variable &lt;math&gt;w\in dom(s)\setminus V&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a team &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; on a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; and a finite set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of variables, we say that a function &lt;math&gt;F:X\rightarrow \mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;-uniform if &lt;math&gt;F(s)=F(t)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;s \sim_V t&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Semantic clauses ====

Team semantics is three-valued, in the sense that a formula may happen to be positively satisfied by a team on a given structure, or negatively satisfied by it, or neither. The semantics clauses for positive and negative satisfaction are defined by simultaneous induction on the synctactical structure of IF formulas.

Positive satisfaction:

# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M, X \models^+ R t_1 \ldots t_n&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, for every assignment &lt;math&gt;s \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M, s \models R t_1 \ldots t_n&lt;/math&gt; in the sense of first-order logic (that is, the tuple &lt;math&gt;\!(s(t_1) \ldots s(t_n))&lt;/math&gt; is in the interpretation &lt;math&gt;R^{\mathcal M}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;).
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ t_1 = t_2&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, for every assignment &lt;math&gt;s \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M, s \models t_1 = t_2&lt;/math&gt; in the sense of first-order logic (that is, &lt;math&gt;s(t_1) = s(t_2)&lt;/math&gt;).
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ \lnot \phi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^- \phi&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ \varphi \wedge \psi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ \psi&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ \varphi \vee \psi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exist teams &lt;math&gt;\!Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!Z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X = Y \cup Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,Y \models^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,Z \models^+ \psi&lt;/math&gt;. 
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ (\forall v/V) \varphi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X[M/v] \models^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ (\exists v/V) \varphi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;-uniform function &lt;math&gt;F: X \rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;such that &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X[F/v] \models^+ \phi&lt;/math&gt;.

Negative satisfaction:

# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M, X \models^- R t_1 \ldots t_n&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, for every assignment &lt;math&gt;s \in X&lt;/math&gt;, the tuple &lt;math&gt;\!(s(t_1) \ldots s(t_n))&lt;/math&gt; is not in the interpretation &lt;math&gt;R^{\mathcal M}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^- t_1 = t_2&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, for every assignment &lt;math&gt;s \in X&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;s(t_1) \neq s(t_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^- \lnot \phi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ \phi&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^- \varphi \wedge \psi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if  there exist teams &lt;math&gt;\!Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!Z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X = Y \cup Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,Y \models^- \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,Z \models^- \psi&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^- \varphi \vee \psi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^- \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^- \psi&lt;/math&gt;. 
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ (\forall v/V) \varphi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;-uniform function &lt;math&gt;F: X \rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;such that &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X[F/v] \models^+ \phi&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X \models^+ (\exists v/V) \varphi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\!\mathcal M,X[M/v] \models^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Truth, falsity, indeterminacy ====

According to team semantics, an IF sentence &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is said to be true (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt;) on a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; if it is satisfied on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; by the singleton team &lt;math&gt;\{\emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt;, in symbols: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,\{\emptyset\}\models^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt;. 
Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is said to be false (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models^- \varphi&lt;/math&gt;) on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,\{\emptyset\}\models^-\varphi&lt;/math&gt;; it is said to be undetermined (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models^0 \varphi&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,\{\emptyset\}\not\models^+\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,\{\emptyset\}\not\models^-\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Relationship with Game-Theoretical Semantics ====

For any team &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; on a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;, and any IF formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X \models^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X \models_{GTS}^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X \models^- \varphi&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X \models_{GTS}^- \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

From this it immediately follows that, for sentences &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models^+ \varphi \Leftrightarrow \mathcal M\models_{GTS}^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models^- \varphi \Leftrightarrow \mathcal M\models_{GTS}^- \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M\models^0 \varphi \Leftrightarrow \mathcal M\models^0_{GTS} \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

== Notions of equivalence ==

Since IF logic is, in its usual acception, three-valued, multiple notions of formula equivalence are of interest.

=== Equivalence of formulas ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi&lt;/math&gt; be two IF formulas.

&lt;math&gt;\varphi\models^+\psi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; ''truth entails'' &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X\models^+\varphi \Rightarrow \mathcal M,X\models^+\psi&lt;/math&gt; for any structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; and any team &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;dom(X)\supseteq \mbox{Free}(\varphi)\cup \mbox{Free}(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\varphi \equiv^+\psi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is ''truth equivalent'' to &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\models^+\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\models^+\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\varphi\models^-\psi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; ''falsity entails'' &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X\models^-\psi \Rightarrow \mathcal M,X\models^-\varphi&lt;/math&gt; for any structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; and any team &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;dom(X)\supseteq \mbox{Free}(\varphi)\cup \mbox{Free}(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\varphi \equiv^-\psi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is ''falsity equivalent'' to &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\models^-\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\models^-\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\varphi\models\psi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; ''strongly entails'' to &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\models^+\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi\models^-\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\varphi \equiv\psi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is ''strongly equivalent'' to &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;\varphi \equiv^+\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi \equiv^-\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Equivalence of sentences ===

The definitions above specialize for IF sentences as follows.
Two IF sentences &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi&lt;/math&gt; are ''truth equivalent'' if they are true in the same structures; they are ''falsity equivalent'' if they are false in the same structures; they are ''strongly equivalent'' if they are both truth and falsity equivalent.

Intuitively, using strong equivalence amounts to considering IF logic as 3-valued (true/undetermined/false), while truth equivalence treats IF sentences as if they were 2-valued (true/untrue).

=== Equivalence relative to a context ===

Many logical rules of IF logic can be adequately expressed only in terms of more restricted notions of equivalence, which take into account the context in which a formula might appear.

For example, if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of variables and &lt;math&gt;U\supseteq \mbox{Free}(\varphi)\cup\mbox{Free}(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;, one can state that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is ''truth equivalent to'' &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; ''relative to'' &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\varphi \equiv_U\psi&lt;/math&gt;) in case &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X\models^+\psi \Leftrightarrow \mathcal M,X\models^+\varphi&lt;/math&gt; for any structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; and any team &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ''of domain'' &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

== Model-theoretic properties ==

=== Sentence level ===

IF sentences can be translated in a truth-preserving fashion into sentences of (functional) [[second-order logic|existential second-order logic]] (&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt;) by means of the Skolemization procedure (see above). Vice versa, every &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt; can be translated into an IF sentence by means of a variant of the Walkoe-Enderton translation procedure for [[branching quantifier|partially-ordered quantifiers]] (&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWal1970|Walkoe 1970]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEnd1970|Enderton 1970]]&lt;/ref&gt;). In other words, IF logic and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt; are expressively equivalent at the level of sentences. This equivalence can be used to prove many of the properties that follow; they are inherited from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt; and in many cases similar to properties of FOL.

We denote by &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; a (possibly infinite) set of IF sentences.

* Löwenheim-Skolem property: if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has an infinite model, or arbitrarily large finite models, than it has models of every infinite cardinality.
* Existential compactness: if every finite &lt;math&gt;T_0\subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; has a model, then also &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has a model.
* Failure of deductive compactness: there are &lt;math&gt;T,\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T\models\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;T_0\not\models\varphi&lt;/math&gt; for any finite &lt;math&gt;T_0\subset T&lt;/math&gt;. This is a difference from FOL.
* Separation theorem: if &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi&lt;/math&gt; are mutually inconsistent IF sentences, then there is a FOL sentence &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi\models^+\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\models^+\lnot\theta&lt;/math&gt;. This is a consequence of [[Craig's interpolation theorem]] for FOL.
* Burgess' theorem:&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBur2003|Burgess 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi&lt;/math&gt; are mutually inconsistent IF sentences, then there is an IF sentence &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi\equiv^+\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\equiv^+\lnot\theta&lt;/math&gt; (except possibly for one-element structures). In particular, this theorem reveals that the negation of IF logic is not a semantical operation with respect to truth equivalence (truth-equivalent sentences may have non-equivalent negations).
* Definability of truth:&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSan1998|Sandu 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; there is an IF sentence &lt;math&gt;TRUE(c)&lt;/math&gt;, in the language of Peano Arithmetic, such that, for any IF sentence &lt;math&gt;\varphi,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}\models\varphi \Leftrightarrow \mathbb{N}\models TRUE(\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\ulcorner\urcorner&lt;/math&gt; denotes a Gödel numbering). A weaker statement also holds for nonstandard models of Peano Arithmetic (&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVaa2007|Väänänen 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Formula level ===

The notion of satisfiability by a team has the following properties:

*Downward closure: if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X\models^\pm \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,Y\models^\pm \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
*Consistency: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X\models^+ \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X\models^- \varphi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;X=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
*Non-locality: there are &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X,\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X\models \varphi\not\Leftrightarrow M,X_{\upharpoonright \mbox{Free}(\varphi)}\models \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

Since IF formulas are satisfied by teams and formulas of classical logics are satisfied by assignments, there is no obvious intertranslation between IF formulas and formulas of some classical logic system. However, there is a translation procedure&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHod1997b|Hodges 1997b]]&lt;/ref&gt; of IF formulas into ''sentences'' of ''relational'' &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt; (actually, one distinct translation &lt;math&gt;\tau_{U,R}&lt;/math&gt; for each finite &lt;math&gt;U\supseteq \mbox{Free}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; and for each choice of a predicate symbol &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of arity &lt;math&gt;card(U)&lt;/math&gt;). In this kind of translation, an extra n-ary predicate symbol &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is used to represent an n-variable team &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This is motivated by the fact that, once an ordering &lt;math&gt;v_1\dots v_n&lt;/math&gt; of the variables of &lt;math&gt;dom(X)&lt;/math&gt; has been fixed, it is possible to associate a relation &lt;math&gt;Rel_{v_1\dots v_n}(X) = \{(s(v_1),\dots,s(v_n)) | s\in X\}&lt;/math&gt; to the team &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. With this conventions, an IF formula is related to its translation thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X\models \varphi \Leftrightarrow (\mathcal M,Rel_{v_1\dots v_n}(X))\models \tau_{dom(X),R}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;   
where &lt;math&gt;(M,Rel_{v_1\dots v_n}(X))&lt;/math&gt; is the expansion of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; that assigns &lt;math&gt;Rel_{v_1\dots v_n}(X)&lt;/math&gt; as interpretation for the predicate &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

Through this correlation, it is possible to say that, on a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;, an IF formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of n free variables ''defines'' a family of n-ary relations over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; (the family of the relations &lt;math&gt;Rel_{v_1\dots v_n}(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M,X\models\varphi&lt;/math&gt;).

In 2009, Kontinen and Väänänen,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKonVaa2009|Kontinen&amp;Väänänen 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; showed, by means of a partial inverse translation procedure, that the families of relations that are definable by IF logic are exactly those that are nonempty, downward closed and definable in relational &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt; with an extra predicate &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (or, equivalently, nonempty and definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt; sentence in which &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; occurs only negatively).

== Extended IF logic ==
{{expand section|date=October 2012}}
IF logic is not closed under classical negation. The boolean closure of IF logic is known as '''extended IF logic''' and it is equivalent to a proper fragment of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^1&lt;/math&gt; (Figueira et al. 2011). Hintikka (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;196) claimed that "virtually all of classical mathematics can in principle be done in extended IF first-order logic".

== Properties and critique ==
A number of properties of IF logic follow from logical equivalence with &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; and bring it closer to [[first-order logic]] including a [[compactness theorem]], a [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], and a [[Craig interpolation]] theorem. (Väänänen, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;86). However, Väänänen (2001) proved that the set of [[Gödel number]]s of valid sentences of IF logic with at least one binary
predicate symbol (set denoted by ''Val&lt;sub&gt;IF&lt;/sub&gt;'') is [[recursively]] [[isomorphic]] with the corresponding set of Gödel numbers of valid (full) second-order sentences in a vocabulary that contains one binary predicate symbol (set denoted by ''Val&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''). Furthermore, Väänänen showed that ''Val&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the complete [[Levy hierarchy|Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-definable]] set of integers, and that it is ''Val&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' not in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^m_n&lt;/math&gt; for any finite ''m'' and ''n''. Väänänen (2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;136–139) summarizes the complexity results as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Problem !! first-order logic !! IF/dependence/ESO logic
|-
| [[Decidability (logic)|Decision]]|| &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^0&lt;/math&gt; ([[recursively enumerable|r.e.]]) || &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| Non-[[Validity (logic)|validity]]|| &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1^0&lt;/math&gt; ([[co-r.e.]]) || &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| [[Consistency]]|| &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1^0&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1^0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Inconsistency||  &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^0&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Feferman (2006) cites Väänänen's 2001 result to argue (contra Hintikka) that while satisfiability might be a first-order matter, the question of whether there is a winning strategy for Verifier over all structures in general "lands us squarely in ''full second order logic''" (emphasis Feferman's). Feferman also attacked the claimed usefulness of the extended IF logic, because the sentences in &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1^1&lt;/math&gt; do not admit a game-theoretic interpretation.

He proved [[Mercer's theorem]], which states that [[positive-definite kernel]]s can be expressed as a [[dot product]] in a high-dimensional [[space#Mathematics|space]]. This theorem is the basis of the [[kernel trick]] ([[Kernel perceptron|applied by Aizerman]]), which allows linear algorithms to be easily converted into non-linear algorithms.

The '''lateral surface''' of an object is the area of all the sides of the object, excluding  the area of its base and top. 

For a [[cube]], the lateral surface area would be the area of four sides.&lt;!--Wouldn't this be 5 sides, i.e., all sides except the base?--&gt; Consider the edge of the cube as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. The area of one square face ''A&lt;sub&gt;face&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;⋅&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the lateral surface of a cube will be the area of four faces: ''a''&amp;nbsp;⋅&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;⋅&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The lateral surface can also be calculated by multiplying the perimeter of the base by the height of the [[prism (geometry)|prism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Prentice Hall |title=Geometry |page=700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a right circular [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of radius ''r'' and height ''h'', the lateral area is the area of the side surface of the cylinder: ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2π''rh''.

For a [[pyramid]], the lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of all of the triangular faces but excluding the area of the base.

For a [[cone]], the Lateral Surface Area would be &lt;math&gt;\pi r l&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the circle at the bottom of the cone and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the lateral height (the length of a line segment from the apex of the cone along its side to its base) of the cone (given by the [[Pythagorean theorem]] &lt;math&gt;l=\sqrt{r^2+h^2}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the cone)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14667">This is a list of some of the ordinary and [[generalized cohomology theory|generalized (or extraordinary)]] homology and cohomology theories in [[algebraic topology]] that are defined on the categories of [[CW complex]]es or [[spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectra]]. For other sorts of homology theories see the [[#See also|links]] at the end of this article.

==Notation==

*''S'' = π = ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''0''&lt;/sup&gt;  is the sphere spectrum.
*''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  is the spectrum of the ''n''-dimensional sphere
*''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''Y'' = ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;∧''Y'' is the ''n''th [[suspension (topology)|suspension]] of a spectrum ''Y''.
*[''X'',''Y''] is the abelian group of morphisms from the spectrum ''X'' to the spectrum ''Y'', given (roughly) as homotopy classes of maps.
*[''X'',''Y'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = [''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''X'',''Y'']
*[''X'',''Y'']&lt;sub&gt;''*''&lt;/sub&gt; is the graded abelian group given as the sum of the groups [''X'',''Y'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
*π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') = [''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''X''] = [''S'',&amp;nbsp;''X'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n''th stable homotopy group of ''X''.
*π&lt;sub&gt;''*''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is the sum of the groups π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), and is called the '''coefficient ring''' of ''X'' when ''X'' is a ring spectrum.
*''X''∧''Y'' is the [[smash product]] of two spectra.

If ''X'' is a spectrum, then it defines generalized homology and cohomology theories on the category of spectra as follows.
*''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'') = [''S'', ''X''∧''Y'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = [''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''X''∧''Y''] is the generalized homology of ''Y'',
*''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y'') = [''Y'', ''X'']&lt;sub&gt;−''n''&lt;/sub&gt; =  [''S''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''Y'', ''X''] is the generalized cohomology of ''Y''

==Ordinary homology theories==

These are the theories satisfying the "dimension axiom" of the [[Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]] that the homology of a point vanishes in dimension other than 0. They are determined by an [[abelian group|abelian]] coefficient group ''G'', and denoted by H(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''G'') (where
''G'' is sometimes omitted, especially if it is '''Z'''). Usually ''G'' is the integers, the rationals, the reals, the complex numbers, or the integers mod a prime ''p''.

The cohomology functors of ordinary cohomology theories are represented by [[Eilenberg–MacLane space]]s.

On simplicial complexes, these theories coincide with [[singular homology]] and cohomology.

===Homology and cohomology with integer coefficients.===
'''Spectrum:''' H ([[Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum]] of the integers.)

'''Coefficient ring:'''  π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(H) = '''Z''' if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, 0 otherwise.

The original homology theory.

===Homology and cohomology with rational (or real or complex) coefficients.===
'''Spectrum:''' HQ (Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum of the rationals.)

'''Coefficient ring:'''  π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(HQ) = '''Q''' if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, 0 otherwise.

These are the easiest of all homology theories.
The homology groups HQ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') are often denoted by H&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Q'').
The homology groups H(''X'', '''Q'''), H(''X'', '''R'''), H(''X'', '''C''') with [[rational number|rational]], [[real number|real]], and [[complex number|complex]] coefficients are all similar, and are used mainly when torsion is not of interest (or too complicated to work out). The [[Hodge decomposition]] writes the complex cohomology of a complex [[projective variety]] as a sum of [[sheaf cohomology]] groups.

===Homology and cohomology with mod ''p'' coefficients.===
'''Spectrum:''' HZ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (Eilenberg–Maclane spectrum of the integers mod&amp;nbsp;''p''.)

'''Coefficient ring:'''  π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(HZ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; (Integers mod ''p'') if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, 0 otherwise.

==K-theories==

The simpler [[K-theory|K-theories]] of a space are often related to [[vector bundle]]s over the space, and different sorts of K-theories correspond to different structures that can be put on a vector bundle.

===Real K-theory===
'''Spectrum:''' KO

'''Coefficient ring:''' The coefficient groups π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(KO) have period 8 in ''i'', given by the sequence '''Z''', '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,0, '''Z''', 0, 0, 0, repeated. As a ring, it is generated by a class ''η'' in degree 1, a class ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in degree 4, and an invertible class ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; in degree 8, subject to the relations that 2''η''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''η''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''ηx''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

KO&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') is the ring of stable equivalence classes of real vector bundles over ''X''. [[Bott periodicity]] implies that the K-groups have period 8.

===Complex K-theory===
'''Spectrum:''' KU (even terms BU or '''Z'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;BU, odd terms ''U'').

'''Coefficient ring:''' The coefficient ring ''K''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(point) is the ring of [[Laurent polynomials]] in a generator of degree&amp;nbsp;2.

''K''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') is the ring of stable equivalence classes of complex vector bundles over ''X''. [[Bott periodicity]] implies that the K-groups have period 2.

===Quaternionic K-theory===
'''Spectrum:''' KSp

'''Coefficient ring:''' The coefficient groups π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(KSp) have period 8 in ''i'', given by the sequence '''Z''', 0, 0, 0,'''Z''', '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,0, repeated.

KSp&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') is the ring of stable equivalence classes of quaternionic vector bundles over ''X''. [[Bott periodicity]] implies that the K-groups have period 8.

===K theory with coefficients===
'''Spectrum:''' KG

''G'' is some abelian group; for example the localization '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt; at the prime ''p''. Other K-theories can also be given coefficients.

===Self conjugate K-theory===
'''Spectrum:''' KSC

'''Coefficient ring:''' ''to be written...''

The coefficient groups &lt;math&gt;\pi_i&lt;/math&gt;(KSC) have period 4 in ''i'', given by the sequence '''Z''', '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0, '''Z''',  repeated. Introduced by Donald W. Anderson in his unpublished 1964  [[University of California, Berkeley]] Ph.D. dissertation, "A new cohomology theory".

===Connective K-theories===
'''Spectrum:''' ku for connective K-theory, ko for connective real K-theory.

'''Coefficient ring:''' For ku, the coefficient ring is the ring of polynomials over ''Z'' on a single class ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in dimension 2. For ko, the coefficient ring is the quotient of a polynomial ring on three generators, ''η'' in dimension 1, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in dimension 4, and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; in dimension&amp;nbsp;8, the periodicity generator, modulo the relations that 2''η''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, ''η''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and&amp;nbsp;''ηx''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Roughly speaking, this is K-theory with the negative dimensional parts killed off.

===KR-theory===

This is a cohomology theory defined for spaces with involution, from which many of the other K-theories can be derived.

==Bordism and cobordism theories==
[[Cobordism]] studies [[manifold]]s, where a manifold is regarded as "trivial" if it is the boundary of another compact manifold. The cobordism classes of manifolds form a ring that is usually the coefficient ring of some generalized cohomology theory. There are many such theories, corresponding roughly to the different structures that one can put on a manifold.

The functors of cobordism theories are often represented by [[Thom space]]s of certain groups.

===[[Stable homotopy theory|Stable homotopy]] and [[cohomotopy]]===
'''Spectrum:''' S ([[sphere spectrum]]).

'''Coefficient ring:''' The coefficient groups π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') are the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]], which are notoriously hard to compute or understand for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  (For ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 they vanish, and for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 the group is&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''.)

Stable homotopy is closely related to cobordism of [[framed manifold]]s (manifolds with a trivialization of the normal bundle).

===Unoriented cobordism===
'''Spectrum:''' MO ([[Thom spectrum]] of [[orthogonal group]])

'''Coefficient ring:''' π&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(MO) is the ring of cobordism classes of unoriented manifolds, and is a polynomial ring over the field with 2 elements on generators of degree ''i'' for every ''i'' not of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;−1. That is: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2 [ x_2 , x_4 , x_5 , x_6 , x_8 \cdots]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_{2n}&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by the classes of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RP}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; while for odd indices one can use appropriate [[Albrecht Dold|Dold]] manifolds.

Unoriented bordism is 2-torsion, since ''2M'' is the boundary of &lt;math&gt;M \times I&lt;/math&gt;.

MO is a rather weak cobordism theory, as the spectrum MO is isomorphic to
H(π&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(MO)) ("homology with coefficients in π&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(MO)") – MO is a product of [[Eilenberg–MacLane spectra]]. In other words, the corresponding homology and cohomology theories are no more powerful than homology and cohomology with coefficients in '''Z'''/2'''Z'''. This was the first cobordism theory to be described completely.

===Complex cobordism===
{{Main|Complex cobordism}}
'''Spectrum:''' MU (Thom spectrum of [[unitary group]])

'''Coefficient ring:''' π&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(''MU'') is the polynomial ring on generators of degree 2, 4, 6, 8, ...
and is naturally isomorphic to [[Lazard ring|Lazard's universal ring]], and is the cobordism ring of stably [[almost complex manifold]]s.

===Oriented cobordism===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
'''Spectrum:''' MSO (Thom spectrum of [[special orthogonal group]])

'''Coefficient ring:''' The oriented cobordism class of a manifold is completely determined by its characteristic numbers: its [[Stiefel–Whitney number]]s and [[Pontryagin number]]s, but the overall coefficient ring, denoted &lt;math&gt;\Omega_* = \Omega(*) = MSO(*)&lt;/math&gt; is quite complicated.
Rationally, and at 2 (corresponding to Pontryagin and Stiefel–Whitney classes, respectively), MSO is a product of [[Eilenberg–MacLane spectra]] – &lt;math&gt;MSO_{\mathbf Q} = H(\pi_*(MSO_{\mathbf Q}))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;MSO[2] = H(\pi_*(MSO[2]))&lt;/math&gt; – but at odd primes it is not, and the structure is complicated to describe. The ring has been completely described integrally, due to work of [[John Milnor]], Boris Averbuch, [[Vladimir Abramovich Rokhlin|Vladimir Rokhlin]], and [[C. T. C. Wall]].

===Special unitary cobordism===
'''Spectrum:''' MSU (Thom spectrum of [[special unitary group]])

'''Coefficient ring:'''

===Spin cobordism (and variants)===
'''Spectrum:''' MSpin (Thom spectrum of [[spin group]])

'''Coefficient ring:''' See {{harvs|first=D. W.|last= Anderson|first2= E. H. |last2= Brown|first3= F. P. |last3=Peterson|year=1967}}.

===Symplectic cobordism===
'''Spectrum:''' MSp (Thom spectrum of [[symplectic group]])

'''Coefficient ring:'''

===Clifford algebra cobordism===

===PL cobordism and topological cobordism===
'''Spectrum:''' MPL, MSPL, MTop, MSTop

'''Coefficient ring:'''

The definition is similar to cobordism, except that one uses [[Piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear]] or topological instead of [[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[manifold]]s, either oriented or unoriented.
The coefficient rings are complicated.

===Brown–Peterson cohomology===
'''Spectrum:''' BP

'''Coefficient ring:''' π&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(BP) is a polynomial algebra over ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt; on generators ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of dimension 2(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.

Brown–Peterson cohomology BP is a summand of MU&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is complex cobordism MU localized at a prime ''p''. In fact MU&lt;sub&gt;(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt; is a sum of suspensions of BP.

===Morava K-theory===
'''Spectrum:''' K(''n'') (They also depend on a prime ''p''.)

'''Coefficient ring:''' '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;], where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has degree 2(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;-1).

These theories have period 2(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).  They are named after [[Jack Morava]].

===Johnson–Wilson theory===

'''Spectrum''' ''E''(''n'')

'''Coefficient ring''' '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;(2)&lt;/sub&gt;[''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1/''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; has degree 2(2&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;1)

===String cobordism===

'''Spectrum:'''

'''Coefficient ring:'''

==Theories related to [[elliptic curve]]s==

===Elliptic cohomology===
'''Spectrum:''' Ell

{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

===Topological modular forms===
'''Spectra:''' tmf, TMF (previously called eo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.)

The coefficient ring π&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(tmf) is called the ring of [[topological modular forms]]. TMF is tmf with the 24th power of the modular form Δ inverted, and has period 24&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=576. At the prime ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the completion of tmf is the spectrum eo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the K(2)-localization of tmf is the Hopkins-Miller Higher Real K-theory spectrum EO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], [[computer science]] and [[operations research]], '''mathematical optimization''' or '''mathematical programming''', alternatively spelled ''optimisation'', is the selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://glossary.computing.society.informs.org/index.php?page=nature.html The Nature of Mathematical Programming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305080324/http://glossary.computing.society.informs.org/index.php?page=nature.html |date=2014-03-05 }}," ''Mathematical Programming Glossary'', INFORMS Computing Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest case, an [[optimization problem]] consists of [[maxima and minima|maximizing or minimizing]] a [[Function of a real variable|real function]] by systematically choosing [[Argument of a function|input]] values from within an allowed set and computing the [[Value (mathematics)|value]] of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of [[applied mathematics]]. More generally, optimization includes finding "best available" values of some objective function given a defined [[domain of a function|domain]] (or input), including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of domains.

== Optimization problems ==
{{main article|Optimization problem}}
An optimization problem can be represented in the following way:
:''Given:'' a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; from some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to the [[real number]]s
:''Sought:'' an element &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{0}\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f\left(\mathbf{x}_{0}\right)\leq f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\in A&lt;/math&gt; ("minimization") or such that &lt;math&gt;f\left(\mathbf{x}_{0}\right)\geq f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\in A&lt;/math&gt; ("maximization").

Such a formulation is called an '''[[optimization problem]]''' or a '''mathematical programming problem''' (a term not directly related to [[computer programming]], but still in use for example in [[linear programming]] – see [[#History|History]] below). Many real-world and theoretical problems may be modeled in this general framework. Problems formulated using this technique in the fields of [[physics]] and [[computer vision]] may refer to the technique as '''[[energy]] minimization''', speaking of the value of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as representing the energy of the [[system]] being [[Mathematical model|modeled]].

Typically, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is some [[subset]] of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, often specified by a set of ''[[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s'', equalities or inequalities that the members of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have to satisfy.  The [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''search space'' or the ''choice set'',
while the elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are called ''[[candidate solution]]s'' or ''feasible solutions''.

The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called, variously, an '''objective function''', a '''[[loss function]]''' or '''cost function''' (minimization),&lt;ref&gt;W. Erwin Diewert  (2008).  "cost functions," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000390&amp;edition=current&amp;q= Contents].&lt;/ref&gt;  a '''utility function''' or '''fitness function''' (maximization), or, in certain fields, an '''energy function''' or '''energy [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'''. A feasible solution that minimizes (or maximizes, if that is the goal) the objective function is called an ''optimal solution''.

In mathematics, conventional optimization problems are usually stated in terms of minimization. 

A ''local minimum'' 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt;
is defined as an element for which there exists some &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\in A&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\ast}\right\Vert\leq\delta,\,&lt;/math&gt; the expression &lt;math&gt;f\left(\mathbf{x}^{\ast}\right)\leq f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; holds; 

that is to say, on some region around 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt;
all of the function values are greater than or equal to the value at that element.  
Local maxima are defined similarly.

While a local minimum is at least as good as any nearby elements, a [[global minimum]] is at least as good as every feasible element. 
Generally, unless both the objective function and the [[feasible region]] are [[Convex function|convex]] in a minimization problem, there may be several local minima. 
In a [[convex optimization|convex problem]], if there is a local minimum that is interior (not on the edge of the set of feasible elements), it is also the global minimum, but a nonconvex problem may have more than one local minimum not all of which need be global minima.

A large number of algorithms proposed for solving nonconvex problems – including the majority of commercially available solvers – are  not capable of making a distinction between locally optimal solutions and globally optimal solutions, and will treat the former as actual solutions to the original problem. [[Global optimization]] is the branch of [[applied mathematics]] and [[numerical analysis]] that is concerned with the development of deterministic algorithms that are capable of guaranteeing convergence in finite time to the actual optimal solution of a nonconvex problem.

== Notation ==
Optimization problems are often expressed with special notation. Here are some examples:

=== Minimum and maximum value of a function ===
Consider the following notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\min_{x\in\mathbb R}\; (x^2 + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

This denotes the minimum [[Value (mathematics)|value]] of the objective function &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, when choosing ''x'' from the set of [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. The minimum value in this case is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, occurring at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the notation

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{x\in\mathbb R}\; 2x&lt;/math&gt;

asks for the maximum value of the objective function 2''x'', where ''x'' may be any real number. In this case, there is no such maximum as the objective function is unbounded, so the answer is "[[infinity]]" or "undefined".

=== Optimal input arguments ===
{{Main article|Arg max}}
Consider the following notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x\in(-\infty,-1]}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \; x^2 + 1,&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \; x^2 + 1, \; \text{subject to:} \; x\in(-\infty,-1].&lt;/math&gt;

This represents the value (or values) of the [[Argument of a function|argument]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,-1]&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes (or minimize) the objective function &lt;math&gt;x^2+1&lt;/math&gt; (the actual minimum value of that function is not what the problem asks for). In this case, the answer is &lt;math&gt;x = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; is infeasible, i.e. does not belong to the [[feasible set]].

Similarly, 
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x\in[-5,5], \; y\in\mathbb R}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \; x\cos(y),&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x, \; y}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \; x\cos(y), \; \text{subject to:} \; x\in[-5,5], \; y\in\mathbb R,&lt;/math&gt;

represents the &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; pair (or pairs) that maximizes (or maximize) the value of the objective function &lt;math&gt;x\cos(y)&lt;/math&gt;, with the added constraint that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; lie in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-5,5]&lt;/math&gt; (again, the actual maximum value of the expression does not matter). In this case, the solutions are the pairs of the form &lt;math&gt;(5,\,2k\pi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-5,\,(2k+1)\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; ranges over all [[integer]]s.

Operators &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg\,min} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg\,max} &lt;/math&gt; are sometimes also written as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{argmin} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{argmax} &lt;/math&gt;, and stand for '''argument of the minimum''' and '''argument of the maximum'''.

== History ==
[[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] found calculus-based formulae for identifying optima, while [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] proposed iterative methods for moving towards an optimum.

The term "[[linear programming]]" for certain optimization cases was due to [[George Dantzig|George&amp;nbsp;B. Dantzig]], although much of the theory had been introduced by [[Leonid Kantorovich]] in 1939. (''Programming'' in this context does not refer to [[computer programming]], but from the use of ''program'' by the United States military to refer to proposed training and [[logistics]] schedules, which were the problems Dantzig studied at that time.) Dantzig published the [[Simplex algorithm]] in 1947, and [[John von Neumann]] developed the theory of [[Linear programming#Duality|duality]] in the same year.

== Major subfields ==
* [[Convex programming]] studies the case when the objective function is [[convex function|convex]] (minimization) or [[Concave function|concave]] (maximization) and the constraint set is [[convex set|convex]]. This can be viewed as a particular case of nonlinear programming or as generalization of linear or convex quadratic programming.
** [[Linear programming]] (LP), a type of convex programming, studies the case in which the objective function ''f'' is linear and the constraints are specified using only linear equalities and inequalities. Such a constraint set is called a [[polyhedron]] or a [[polytope]] if it is [[Bounded set|bounded]].
** [[Second order cone programming]] (SOCP) is a convex program, and includes certain types of quadratic programs.
** [[Semidefinite programming]] (SDP) is a subfield of convex optimization where the underlying variables are [[semidefinite]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. It is a generalization of linear and convex quadratic programming.
** [[Conic programming]] is a general form of convex programming.  LP, SOCP and SDP can all be viewed as conic programs with the appropriate type of cone.
** [[Geometric programming]] is a technique whereby objective and inequality constraints expressed as [[posynomials]] and equality constraints as [[monomials]] can be transformed into a convex program.
* [[Integer programming]] studies linear programs in which some or all variables are constrained to take on [[integer]] values.  This is not convex, and in general much more difficult than regular linear programming.
* [[Quadratic programming]] allows the objective function to have quadratic terms, while the feasible set must be specified with linear equalities and inequalities.  For specific forms of the quadratic term, this is a type of convex programming.
* [[Fractional programming]] studies optimization of ratios of two nonlinear functions. The special class of concave fractional programs can be transformed to a convex optimization problem.
* [[Nonlinear programming]] studies the general case in which the objective function or the constraints or both contain nonlinear parts.  This may or may not be a convex program. In general, whether the program is convex affects the difficulty of solving it.
* [[Stochastic programming]] studies the case in which some of the constraints or parameters depend on [[random variable]]s.
* [[Robust optimization|Robust programming]] is, like stochastic programming, an attempt to capture uncertainty in the data underlying the optimization problem. Robust optimization targets to find solutions that are valid under all possible realizations of the uncertainties. 
* [[Combinatorial optimization]] is concerned with problems where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] one.
* [[Stochastic optimization]] is used with random (noisy) function measurements or random inputs in the search process.
* [[Infinite-dimensional optimization]] studies the case when the set of feasible solutions is a subset of an infinite-[[dimension]]al space, such as a space of functions.
* [[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristics]] and [[metaheuristic]]s make few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized. Usually, heuristics do not guarantee that any optimal solution need be found. On the other hand, heuristics are used to find approximate solutions for many complicated optimization problems.
* [[Constraint satisfaction]] studies the case in which the objective function ''f'' is constant (this is used in [[artificial intelligence]], particularly in [[automated reasoning]]).
** [[Constraint programming]] is a programming paradigm wherein relations between variables are stated in the form of constraints. 
* Disjunctive programming is used where at least one constraint must be satisfied but not all. It is of particular use in scheduling.
* [[Space mapping]] is a concept for modeling and optimization of an engineering system to high-fidelity (fine) model accuracy exploiting a suitable physically meaningful coarse or [[surrogate model]].

In a number of subfields, the techniques are designed primarily for optimization in dynamic contexts (that is, decision making over time):
* [[Calculus of variations]] seeks to optimize an action integral over some space to an extremum by varying a function of the coordinates.
* [[Optimal control]] theory is a generalization of the calculus of variations which introduces control policies.
* [[Dynamic programming]] studies the case in which the optimization strategy is based on splitting the problem into smaller subproblems. The equation that describes the relationship between these subproblems is called the [[Bellman equation]].
* [[Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints]] is where the constraints include [[variational inequalities]] or  [[complementarity theory|complementarities]].

=== Multi-objective optimization ===
{{Main article|Multi-objective optimization}}
Adding more than one objective to an optimization problem adds complexity. For example, to optimize a structural design, one would desire a design that is both light and rigid. When two objectives conflict, a trade-off must be created. There may be one lightest design, one stiffest design, and an infinite number of designs that are some compromise of weight and rigidity. The set of trade-off designs that cannot be improved upon according to one criterion without hurting another criterion is known as the [[Pareto set]]. The curve created plotting weight against stiffness of the best designs is known as the [[Pareto frontier]].

A design is judged to be "Pareto optimal" (equivalently, "Pareto efficient" or in the Pareto set) if it is not dominated by any other design: If it is worse than another design in some respects and no better in any respect, then it is dominated and is not Pareto optimal.

The choice among "Pareto optimal" solutions to determine the "favorite solution" is delegated to the decision maker. In other words, defining the problem as multi-objective optimization signals that some information is missing: desirable objectives are given but combinations of them are not rated relative to each other. In some cases, the missing information can be derived by interactive sessions with the decision maker.

Multi-objective optimization problems have been generalized further into [[vector optimization]] problems where the (partial) ordering is no longer given by the Pareto ordering.

=== Multi-modal optimization ===
Optimization problems are often multi-modal; that is, they possess multiple good solutions. They could all be globally good (same cost function value) or there could be a mix of globally good and locally good solutions. Obtaining all (or at least some of) the multiple solutions is the goal of a multi-modal optimizer.

Classical optimization techniques due to their iterative approach do not perform satisfactorily when they are used to obtain multiple solutions, since it is not guaranteed that different solutions will be obtained even with different starting points in multiple runs of the algorithm. [[Evolutionary algorithm]]s, however, are a very popular approach to obtain multiple solutions in a multi-modal optimization task.

== Classification of critical points and extrema ==

=== Feasibility problem ===
The '''[[satisfiability problem]]''', also called the '''feasibility problem''', is just the problem of finding any [[feasible solution]] at all without regard to objective value. This can be regarded as the special case of mathematical optimization where the objective value is the same for every solution, and thus any solution is optimal.

Many optimization algorithms need to start from a feasible point. One way to obtain such a point is to [[Relaxation (approximation)|relax]] the feasibility conditions using a [[slack variable]]; with enough slack, any starting point is feasible. Then, minimize that slack variable until slack is null or negative.

=== Existence ===
The [[extreme value theorem]] of [[Karl Weierstrass]] states that a continuous real-valued function on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum value. More generally, a lower semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its minimum; an upper semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its maximum.

=== Necessary conditions for optimality ===
[[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|One of Fermat's theorems]] states that optima of unconstrained problems are found at [[stationary point]]s, where the first derivative or the gradient of the objective function is zero (see [[first derivative test]]). More generally, they may be found at [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]], where the first derivative or gradient of the objective function is zero or is undefined, or on the boundary of the choice set. An equation (or set of equations) stating that the first derivative(s) equal(s) zero at an interior optimum is called a 'first-order condition' or a set of first-order conditions.

Optima of equality-constrained problems can be found by the [[Lagrange multiplier]] method. The optima of problems with equality and/or inequality constraints can be found using the '[[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]]'.

=== Sufficient conditions for optimality ===
While the first derivative test identifies points that might be extrema, this test does not distinguish a point that is a minimum from one that is a maximum or one that is neither. When the objective function is twice differentiable, these cases can be distinguished by checking the second derivative or the matrix of second derivatives (called the [[Hessian matrix]]) in unconstrained problems, or the matrix of second derivatives of the objective function and the constraints called the [[Hessian matrix#Bordered Hessian|bordered Hessian]] in constrained problems. The conditions that distinguish maxima, or minima, from other stationary points are called 'second-order conditions' (see '[[Second derivative test]]'). If a candidate solution satisfies the first-order conditions, then satisfaction of the second-order conditions as well is sufficient to establish at least local optimality.

=== Sensitivity and continuity of optima ===
The [[envelope theorem]] describes how the value of an optimal solution changes when an underlying [[parameter]] changes. The process of computing this change is called [[comparative statics]].

The [[maximum theorem]] of [[Claude Berge]] (1963) describes the continuity of an optimal solution as a function of underlying parameters.

===Calculus of optimization===
{{Main article|Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions}}
{{See also|Critical point (mathematics)|Differential calculus|Gradient|Hessian matrix|Positive definite matrix|Lipschitz continuity|Rademacher's theorem|Convex function|Convex analysis}}

For unconstrained problems with twice-differentiable functions, some [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s can be found by finding the points where the [[gradient]] of the objective function is zero (that is, the stationary points). More generally, a zero [[subgradient]] certifies that a local minimum has been found for [[convex optimization|minimization problems with convex]] [[convex function|function]]s and other [[Rademacher's theorem|locally]] [[Lipschitz function]]s.

Further, critical points can be classified  using the [[positive definite matrix|definiteness]] of the [[Hessian matrix]]: If the Hessian is ''positive'' definite at a critical point, then the point is a local minimum; if the Hessian matrix is negative definite, then the point is a local maximum; finally, if indefinite, then the point is some kind of [[saddle point]].

Constrained problems can often be transformed into unconstrained problems with the help of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s. [[Lagrangian relaxation]] can also provide approximate solutions to difficult constrained problems.

When the objective function is [[Convex function|convex]], then any local minimum will also be a global minimum. There exist efficient numerical techniques for minimizing convex functions, such as [[interior-point method]]s.

== Computational optimization techniques ==

To solve problems, researchers may use [[algorithm]]s that terminate in a finite number of steps, or [[iterative method]]s that converge to a solution (on some specified class of problems), or [[heuristic algorithm|heuristics]] that may provide approximate solutions to some problems (although their iterates need not converge).

'''Introduction'''



An optimization algorithm is a procedure which is executed iteratively by comparing various solutions till an optimum or a satisfactory solution will be found. Optimization algorithms help us to minimize or maximize an objective function  E(x) which is simply a mathematical function dependent on the Model’s internal parameters which are used in computing the target values(Y) from the set of predictors(X) used in the model. There are two types of optimization algorithms which are widely used such as Zero-order algorithms, First Order Optimization Algorithms and Second Order Optimization Algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Optimization Methods. Department of Mechanical Engineering. India Institute of Technology Madras.

Zero-order (or derivative-free) algorithms use only the criterion value at some positions. It is popular when the gradient and Hessian information are difficult to obtain, e.g., no explicit function forms are given.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ruffio , D. Saury, D. Petit, M.Girault. Zero-Order optimization algorithms. Retrieved from http://www.sft.asso.fr/Local/sft/dir/user-3775/documents/actes/Metti5_School/Lectures&amp;Tutorials-Texts/Text-T2-Ruffio.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These algorithms minimize or maximize a Loss function E(x) using its Gradient values with respect to the parameters. Most widely used First order optimization algorithm is Gradient Descent.  The First order derivative displays whether the function is decreasing or increasing at a particular point. First order Derivative basically will provide us a line which is tangential to a point on its Error Surface.&lt;ref&gt;Ye.Y. Zero-Order and First-Order Optimization Algorithms I.

''Example''

''Gradient descent''

It is a first order optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. 

θ=θ−η⋅∇J(θ) — it is the formula of the parameter updates, where ‘η’ is the learning rate ,’∇J(θ)’ is the Gradient of Loss function-J(θ) w.r.t parameters-‘θ’.

It is the most popular Optimization algorithms used in optimizing a Neural Network. Now gradient descent is majorly used to do Weights updates in a Neural Network Model , i.e update and tune the Model’s parameters in a direction so that we can minimize the Loss function. Now we all know a Neural Network trains via a famous technique called Back-propagation , in which propagating forward calculating the dot product of Inputs signals and their corresponding Weights and then applying a activation function to those sum of products, which transforms the input signal to an output signal and also is important to model complex Non-linear functions and introduces Non-linearity to the Model which enables the Model to learn almost any arbitrary functional mapping.&lt;ref&gt;Evans.J (1992). Optimization algorithms for networks and graphs. CRC Press 2nd edition. &lt;/ref&gt;



'''Second Order Optimization Algorithms'''&lt;ref&gt;Walia,A(2017). Types of Optimization Algorithms used in Neural Networks and Ways to Optimize Gradient Descent. Retrieved from towardsdatascience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-order methods use the second order derivative which is also called Hessian to minimize or maximize the loss function.The Hessian is a Matrix of Second Order Partial Derivatives. Since the second derivative is costly to compute, the second order is not used much. The second order derivative informs us whether the first derivative is increasing or decreasing which hints at the function’s curvature.It also provides us with a quadratic surface which touches the curvature of the Error Surface.&lt;ref&gt;Manson.L, Baxter,J, Bartlett.P, &amp; Fream.M. Boosting algorithms as gradient descent. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Iterative methods===
{{Main article|Iterative method}}
{{See also|Newton's method in optimization|Quasi-Newton method|Finite difference|Approximation theory|Numerical analysis}}

The [[iterative methods]] used to solve problems of [[nonlinear programming]] differ according to whether they [[subroutine|evaluate]] [[Hessian matrix|Hessians]], gradients, or only function values. While evaluating Hessians (H) and gradients (G) improves the rate of convergence, for functions for which these quantities exist and vary sufficiently smoothly, such evaluations increase the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] (or computational cost) of each iteration. In some cases, the computational complexity may be excessively high.

One major criterion for optimizers is just the number of required function evaluations as this often is already a large computational effort, usually much more effort than within the optimizer itself, which mainly has to operate over the N variables.
The derivatives provide detailed information for such optimizers, but are even harder to calculate, e.g. approximating the gradient takes at least N+1 function evaluations. For approximations of the 2nd derivatives (collected in the Hessian matrix) the number of function evaluations is in the order of N². Newton's method requires the 2nd order derivates, so for each iteration the number of function calls is in the order of N², but for a simpler pure gradient optimizer it is only N. However, gradient optimizers need usually more iterations than Newton's algorithm. Which one is best with respect to the number of function calls depends on the problem itself.

** [[Sequential quadratic programming]]: A Newton-based method for small-medium scale ''constrained'' problems. Some versions can handle large-dimensional problems.
** [[Interior point methods]]: This is a large class of methods for constrained optimization. Some interior-point  methods use only (sub)gradient information, and others of which require the evaluation of Hessians.
* Methods that evaluate gradients, or approximate gradients in some way (or even subgradients):
** [[Coordinate descent]] methods: Algorithms which update a single coordinate in each iteration
** [[Conjugate gradient method]]s: [[Iterative method]]s for large problems. (In theory, these methods terminate in a finite number of steps with quadratic objective functions, but this finite termination is not observed in practice on finite–precision computers.)
** [[Gradient descent]] (alternatively, "steepest descent" or "steepest ascent"): A (slow) method of historical and theoretical interest, which has had renewed interest for finding approximate solutions of enormous problems.
** [[Subgradient method]]s - An iterative method for large [[Rademacher's theorem|locally]] [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz function]]s using [[subgradient|generalized gradient]]s. Following Boris T. Polyak, subgradient–projection methods are similar to conjugate–gradient methods.
** Bundle method of descent: An iterative method for small–medium-sized problems with locally Lipschitz functions, particularly for [[convex optimization|convex minimization]] problems.  (Similar to conjugate gradient methods)
** [[Ellipsoid method]]: An iterative method for small problems with [[quasiconvex function|quasiconvex]] objective functions and of great theoretical interest, particularly in establishing the polynomial time complexity of some combinatorial optimization problems. It has similarities with Quasi-Newton methods.
** [[Frank–Wolfe algorithm|Conditional gradient method (Frank–Wolfe)]] for approximate minimization of specially structured problems with [[linear constraints]], especially with traffic networks. For general unconstrained problems, this method reduces to the gradient method, which is regarded as obsolete (for almost all problems).
** [[Quasi-Newton method]]s: Iterative methods for medium-large problems (e.g. N&lt;1000).
** [[Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation]] (SPSA) method for stochastic optimization; uses random (efficient) gradient approximation.
* Methods that evaluate only function values: If a problem is continuously differentiable, then gradients can be approximated using finite differences, in which case a gradient-based method can be used.
** [[Interpolation]] methods
** [[Pattern search (optimization)|Pattern search]] methods, which have better convergence properties than the [[Nelder–Mead method|Nelder–Mead heuristic (with simplices)]], which is listed below.

===Global convergence===
More generally, if the objective function is not a quadratic function, then many optimization methods use other methods to ensure that some subsequence of iterations converges to an optimal solution. The first and still popular method for ensuring convergence relies on [[line search]]es, which optimize a function along one dimension. A second and increasingly popular method for ensuring convergence uses [[trust region]]s. Both line searches and trust regions are used in modern methods of [[subgradient method|non-differentiable optimization]]. Usually a global optimizer is much slower than advanced local optimizers (such as [[BFGS method|BFGS]]), so often an efficient global optimizer can be constructed by starting the local optimizer from different starting points.

===Heuristics===
{{Main article|Heuristic algorithm}}

Besides (finitely terminating) [[algorithm]]s and (convergent) [[iterative method]]s, there are [[heuristic algorithm|heuristics]]. A heuristic is any algorithm which is not guaranteed (mathematically) to find the solution, but which is nevertheless useful in certain practical situations. List of some well-known heuristics:

== Applications ==

===Mechanics===
Problems in [[rigid body dynamics]] (in particular articulated rigid body dynamics) often require mathematical programming techniques, since you can view rigid body dynamics as attempting to solve an [[ordinary differential equation]] on a constraint manifold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.F. |last=Vereshchagin |title=Modelling and control of motion of manipulation robots |journal=Soviet Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=29–38 |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the constraints are various nonlinear geometric constraints such as "these two points must always coincide", "this surface must not penetrate any other", or "this point must always lie somewhere on this curve". Also, the problem of computing contact forces can be done by solving a [[linear complementarity problem]], which can also be viewed as a QP (quadratic programming) problem.

Many design problems can also be expressed as optimization programs. This application is called design optimization. One subset is the [[engineering optimization]], and another recent and growing subset of this field is [[multidisciplinary design optimization]], which, while useful in many problems, has in particular been applied to [[aerospace engineering]] problems.

This approach may be applied in cosmology and astrophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. |last=Haggag|first2=F. |last2=Desokey|first3=M., |last3=Ramadan   |title=A cosmological inflationary model using optimal control |journal= Gravitation and Cosmology|location= |publisher=Pleiades Publishing|volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=236–239 |year=2017 |ISSN=1995-0721 | doi=10.1134/S0202289317030069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics and finance===
[[Economics]] is closely enough linked to optimization of [[agent (economics)|agents]] that an influential definition relatedly describes economics ''qua'' science as the "study of human behavior as a relationship between ends and [[scarce]] means" with alternative uses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lionel Robbins]] (1935, 2nd ed.) ''[[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science#Major propositions|An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science]]'', Macmillan, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern optimization theory includes traditional optimization theory but also overlaps with [[game theory]] and the study of economic [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibria]]. The ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' [[JEL classification codes|codes]] classify mathematical programming, optimization techniques, and related topics under [[JEL classification codes#Mathematical and quantitative methods JEL: C Subcategories|JEL:C61-C63]].

In microeconomics, the [[utility maximization problem]] and its [[dual problem]], the [[expenditure minimization problem]], are economic optimization problems. Insofar as they behave consistently, [[consumer]]s are assumed to maximize their [[utility]], while [[firm]]s are usually assumed to maximize their [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. Also, agents are often modeled as being [[Risk aversion|risk-averse]], thereby preferring to avoid risk. [[Asset pricing|Asset prices]] are also modeled using optimization theory, though the underlying mathematics relies on optimizing [[stochastic process]]es rather than on static optimization. [[International trade theory]] also uses optimization to explain trade patterns between nations. The optimization of [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]] is an example of multi-objective optimization in economics.

Since the 1970s, economists have modeled dynamic decisions over time using [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Dorfman |authorlink=Robert Dorfman |title=An Economic Interpretation of Optimal Control Theory |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=59 |issue=5 |year=1969 |pages=817–831 |jstor=1810679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, dynamic [[search theory|search model]]s are used to study [[labor economics|labor-market behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas J. |last=Sargent |authorlink=Thomas J.

===Electrical engineering===
Some common applications of optimization techniques in [[electrical engineering]] include [[active filter]] design,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De|first=Bishnu Prasad|last2=Kar|first2=R.|last3=Mandal|first3=D.|last4=Ghoshal|first4=S.

===Civil engineering===
Optimization has been widely used in civil engineering. The most common civil engineering problems that are solved by optimization are cut and fill of roads, life-cycle analysis of structures and infrastructures,&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12205-017-0531-z Piryonesi, S. M., &amp; Tavakolan, M. (2017). A mathematical programming model for solving cost-safety optimization (CSO) problems in the maintenance of structures. KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 1-10.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[resource leveling]]&lt;ref&gt;Hegazy, T., (1999) [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tarek_Hegazy/publication/245283201_Optimization_of_Resource_Allocation_and_Leveling_Using_Genetic_Algorithms/links/576afb7008aefcf135bd51a8.pdf Optimization of Resource Allocation and Leveling Using Genetic Algorithms], Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, ASCE, Vol. 125, No. 3, pp 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt; and schedule optimization.

===Operations research===
Another field that uses optimization techniques extensively is [[operations research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New force on the political scene: the Seophonisten |url=http://www.seophonist-wahl.de/ |publisher=http://www.seophonist-wahl.de |accessdate=14 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218090504/http://www.seophonist-wahl.de/ |archivedate=18 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations research also uses stochastic modeling and simulation to support improved decision-making. Increasingly, operations research uses [[stochastic programming]] to model dynamic decisions that adapt to events; such problems can be solved with large-scale optimization and [[stochastic optimization]] methods.

===Control engineering===
Mathematical optimization is used in much modern controller design. High-level controllers such as [[model predictive control]] (MPC) or real-time optimization (RTO) employ mathematical optimization. These algorithms run online and repeatedly determine values for decision variables, such as choke openings in a process plant, by iteratively solving a mathematical optimization problem including constraints and a model of the system to be controlled.

===Geophysics===
Optimization techniques are regularly used in [[geophysics|geophysical]] parameter estimation problems. Given a set of geophysical measurements, e.g. [[seismology|seismic recordings]], it is common to solve for the [[mineral physics|physical properties]] and [[structure of the earth|geometrical shapes]] of the underlying rocks and fluids.

===Molecular modeling===
{{main article|Molecular modeling}}
Nonlinear optimization methods are widely used in [[conformational analysis]].

===Computational systems biology===
{{main article|Computational systems biology}}
Optimization techniques are used in many facets of computational systems biology such as model building, optimal experimental design, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papoutsakis|first=Eleftherios Terry|date=1984-02|title=Equations and calculations for fermentations of butyric acid bacteria|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.260260210|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=174–187|doi=10.1002/bit.260260210|issn=0006-3592}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Relaxation (extension method)===
Methods to obtain suitable (in some sense) natural extensions of optimization problems that otherwise lack of existence or stability of solutions to obtain problems with guaranteed existence of solutions and their stability in some sense (typically under various perturbation of data) are in general called relaxation. Solutions of such extended (=relaxed) problems in some sense characterizes (at least certain features) of the original problems, e.g. as far as their optimizing sequences concerns. Relaxed problems may also possesses their own natural linear structure that may yield specific optimality conditions different from optimality conditions for the original problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7690">In mathematics, a '''matroid polytope''', also called a '''matroid basis polytope''' (or '''basis matroid polytope''') to distinguish it from other polytopes derived from a matroid, is a [[polytope]] constructed via the bases of a [[matroid]]. Given a matroid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the matroid polytope &lt;math&gt;P_M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[convex hull]] of the [[indicator vector]]s of the bases of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a [[matroid]] on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements. Given a basis &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq \{1,\dots, n\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the  '''indicator vector''' of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_B := \sum_{i \in B} \mathbf e_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt; is the standard &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th unit vector in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. The '''matroid polytope''' &lt;math&gt;P_M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[convex hull]] of the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf e_B \mid B \text{ is a basis of } M\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
[[Image:Square pyramid.png|thumb|Square pyramid]]
[[Image:Octahedron.svg|thumb|upright = 0.75|Octahedron]]
* Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be the rank 2 matroid on 4 elements with bases
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}(M) =  \{\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\}\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:That is, all 2-element subsets of  &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4\} &lt;/math&gt; except &lt;math&gt;\{3,4\} &lt;/math&gt;.  The corresponding indicator vectors of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}(M) &lt;/math&gt; are
:: &lt;math&gt;\{\{1,1,0,0\}, \{1,0,1,0\}, \{1,0,0,1\}, \{0,1,1,0\}, \{0,1,0,1\}\}. &lt;/math&gt;
:The matroid polytope of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is
: &lt;math&gt; P_M = \text{conv}\{\{1,1,0,0\}, \{1,0,1,0\}, \{1,0,0,1\}, \{0,1,1,0\}, \{0,1,0,1\}\}. &lt;/math&gt;
:These points form four [[equilateral triangle]]s at point &lt;math&gt;\{1,1,0,0\}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore its convex hull is the [[square pyramid]] by definition.

* Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be the rank 2 matroid on 4 elements with bases that are ''all'' 2-element subsets of &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4\} &lt;/math&gt;.  The corresponding matroid polytope &lt;math&gt;P_N &lt;/math&gt; is the [[octahedron]]. Observe that the polytope &lt;math&gt;P_M&lt;/math&gt; from the previous example is contained in &lt;math&gt;P_N &lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[uniform matroid]] of rank &lt;math&gt;r &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; elements, then the matroid polytope &lt;math&gt;P_M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hypersimplex]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta_n^r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Properties ==
* A matroid polytope is contained in the [[hypersimplex]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta_n^r&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the rank of the associated matroid and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the ground set of the associated matroid.&lt;ref name="goresky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelfand |first1=I.M.|last2=Goresky |first2=R.M. |last3=MacPherson |first3=R.D. |last4=Serganova |first4=V.V.|author4-link= Vera Serganova |year=1987|title=Combinatorial geometries, convex polyhedra, and Schubert cells|journal=Advances in Mathematics|volume=63|issue=3|pages=301&amp;ndash;316|doi=10.1016/0001-8708(87)90059-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More precisely, the vertices of &lt;math&gt;P_M&lt;/math&gt; are a subset of the vertices of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_n^r&lt;/math&gt;.
* Every edge of a matroid polytope &lt;math&gt;P_M&lt;/math&gt; is a parallel translate of &lt;math&gt;e_i-e_j&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i,j\in E&lt;/math&gt;, the ground set of the associated matroid. In other words, the edges of &lt;math&gt;P_M&lt;/math&gt; correspond exactly to the pairs of bases &lt;math&gt;B, B'&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy the [[matroid#Definition|basis exchange property]]: &lt;math&gt;B' = B\setminus{i\cup j}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i,j\in E.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="goresky"/&gt;

* Let  &lt;math&gt; r:2^E \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} &lt;/math&gt; be the rank function of a matroid &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;.  The matroid polytope &lt;math&gt; P_M &lt;/math&gt; can be written uniquely as a signed [[Minkowski addition|Minkowski sum]] of [[simplex|simplices]]:&lt;ref name="volume"/&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; P_M = \sum_{A\subseteq E} \tilde{\beta}(M/A) \Delta_{E-A} &lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; is the ground set of the matroid &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta(M) &lt;/math&gt; is the signed beta invariant of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;:
:: &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\beta}(M) = (-1)^{r(M)+1}\beta(M), &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \beta(M) = (-1)^{r(M)} \sum_{X\subseteq E} (-1)^{|X|}r(X). &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;P_M:= \left\{\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}_+^E~|~\sum_{e\in U}\textbf{x}(e)\leq r(U), \forall U\subseteq E\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

== Related polytopes ==

=== Independence matroid polytope ===
The '''matroid independence polytope''' or '''independence matroid polytope''' is the convex hull of the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{\, \mathbf e_I \mid I \text{ is an independent set of } M \,\} \subseteq \mathbb R^n.&lt;/math&gt;
The (basis) matroid polytope is a face of the independence matroid polytope. Given the [[Matroid#Rank functions|rank]] &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; of a matroid &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;, the independence matroid polytope is equal to the [[polymatroid]] determined by &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Flag matroid polytope ===
The flag matroid polytope is another polytope constructed from the bases of matroids. A '''flag''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a strictly increasing sequence

:&lt;math&gt; F^1 \subset F^2\subset \cdots \subset F^m \, &lt;/math&gt;

of finite sets.&lt;ref name="coxeter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borovik |first1=Alexandre V.|last2= Gelfand |first2=I.M. |last3=White |first3=Neil |title=Coxeter Matroids|journal=Progress in Mathematics|volume=216 |year=2013 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-2066-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt; k_i &lt;/math&gt; be the cardinality of the set &lt;math&gt; F_i &lt;/math&gt;. Two matroids &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''concordant''' if their rank functions satisfy

: &lt;math&gt; r_M(Y) - r_M(X) \leq r_N(Y) - r_N(X) \text{ for all } X\subset Y \subseteq E. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Given pairwise concordant matroids &lt;math&gt; M_1,\dots,M_m &lt;/math&gt; on the ground set &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; with ranks &lt;math&gt; r_1&lt;\cdots &lt;r_m &lt;/math&gt;, consider the collection of flags &lt;math&gt; (B_1,\dots, B_m) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; B_i &lt;/math&gt; is a basis of the matroid &lt;math&gt; M_i &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; B_1 \subset \cdots\subset B_m &lt;/math&gt;.  Such a collection of flags is a '''flag matroid''' &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F} &lt;/math&gt;.  The matroids &lt;math&gt; M_1,\dots,M_m &lt;/math&gt; are called the '''constituents''' of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F} &lt;/math&gt;.
For each flag &lt;math&gt; B=(B_1,\dots,B_m) &lt;/math&gt; in a flag matroid &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F} &lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt; v_B&lt;/math&gt; be the sum of the indicator vectors of each basis in &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; v_B = v_{B_1}+\cdots+v_{B_m}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Given a flag matroid &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F} &lt;/math&gt;, the '''flag matroid polytope''' &lt;math&gt; P_\mathcal{F} &lt;/math&gt; is the convex hull of the set
:&lt;math&gt; \{v_B \mid B\text{ is a flag in }\mathcal{F}\}. &lt;/math&gt;
A flag matroid polytope can be written as a Minkowski sum of the (basis) matroid polytopes of the constituent matroids:&lt;ref name="coxeter"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P_\mathcal{F} = P_{M_1} + \cdots + P_{M_k}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9782">The '''Misra &amp; Gries edge coloring algorithm''' is a [[polynomial time]] algorithm in [[graph theory]] that finds an [[edge coloring]] of any graph. The coloring produces uses at most &lt;math&gt;\Delta+1&lt;/math&gt; colors, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] of the graph. This is optimal for some graphs, and by [[Vizing's theorem]] it uses at most one color more than the optimal for all others.

It was first published by [[Jayadev Misra]] and [[David Gries]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Misra |first=Jayadev |last2=Gries |first2=David|author2-link=David Gries |date=1992 |title=A constructive proof of Vizing's theorem |url=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/misra/psp.dir/vizing.pdf |journal=[[Information Processing Letters]] |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=131–133|doi=10.1016/0020-0190(92)90041-S}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a simplification of a prior algorithm by [[Béla Bollobás]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bollobás |first=Béla |authorlink=Béla Bollobás|date=1982 |title=Graph theory |publisher=Elsevier |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This algorithm is the fastest known almost-optimal algorithm for edge coloring, executing in &lt;math&gt;O(|E||V|)&lt;/math&gt; time. A faster time bound of &lt;math&gt;O(|E|\sqrt{|V|\log|V|})&lt;/math&gt; was claimed in a 1985 technical report by Gabow et al., but this has never been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In general, optimal edge coloring is NP-complete, so it is very unlikely that a polynomial time algorithm exists. There are however exponential time [[Edge coloring#Exact algorithms|exact edge coloring algorithms]] that give an optimal solution.

==Fans==
[[File:Fan, Misra and Gries edge coloring algorithm.png|thumb|A fan F=[x_1,x_2,x_3] of v (dashed edges are uncolored), (v,x_1),(v,x_2),(v,x_3) are the fan edges. F'=[x_1,x_2] is also a fan of v, but it is not maximal.]]

A color ''x'' is said to be '''free''' of an edge (''u,v'') on ''u'' if ''c(u,z)'' ≠ ''x'' for all (u,z) &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E(G) : ''z≠v''.

A '''fan''' of a vertex u is a sequence of vertices F[1:k] that satisfies the following conditions:
 
#F[1:k] is a non-empty sequence of distinct neighbors of u
#(F[1],u) &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E(G) is uncolored
#The color of (F[i+1],u) is free on F[i] for 1 ≤ i &lt; k
[[File:Bicolored path, Misra and Gries edge coloring algorithm.png|thumb|Examples of cd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; paths: ac,cg,gd is a red-green&lt;sub&gt;_c&lt;/sub&gt; path and bd,dg is a red-orange&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; path.]]
Given a fan F, any edge (F[i], X) for 1 ≤ i ≤ k is a '''fan edge'''. Let c and d be colors. A cd&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-path is an edge path that goes through vertex X, only contains edges colored c and d and is maximal (we cannot add any other edge as it would include edges with a color not in {c, d}). Note that only one such path exists for a vertex X, as at most one edge of each color can be adjacent to a given vertex.

===Rotating a fan===
[[File:Rotating a fan, Misra and Gries edge coloring algorithm.png|thumb|Rotating the fan ''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] on the left results in the fan on the right]]
Given a fan ''F''[1:''k''] of a vertex ''X'', the "rotate fan" operation does the following (in parallel):
#c(F[i],X)=c(F[i+1],X)
#Uncolor (F[k],X)

This operation leaves the coloring valid, as for each ''i'', ''c''(''F''[''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1],&amp;nbsp;''X'') was free on (''F''[''i''],&amp;nbsp;''X'').

===Inverting a path===
[[File:Inverting a bicolored path, Misra and edge coloring algorithm.png|thumb|Inverting the red-green&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; path from the graph on the left results in the graph on the right.]]

The operation "invert the cd&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-path" switches every edge on the path colored c to d and every edge colored d to c. Inverting a path can be useful to free a color on X if X is one of the endpoints of the path: if X was adjacent to color c but not d, it will now be adjacent to color d, not c, freeing c for another edge adjacent to X. The flipping operation will not alter the validity of the coloring since for the endpoints, only one of {c, d} can be adjacent to the vertex, and for other members of the path, the operation only switches the color of edges, no new color is added.

==Algorithm==
'''Input:''' A graph G.

'''Output:''' A proper coloring c of the edges of G

Let U := E(G)

'''while''' U ≠ ∅ '''do'''
# Let (u,v) be any edge in U.  
# Let F[1:k] be a maximal fan of u starting at F[1]=v.
# Let c be a color that is free on u and d be a color that is free on F[k].  
# Invert the cd&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; path  
# Let w ∈ V(G) be such that w ∈ F, F'=[F[1]...w] is a fan and d is free on w.  
# Rotate F' and set c(u,w)=d.  
# U := U - {(u,v)}
'''end while'''

==Proof of correctness==
The correctness of the algorithm is proved in three parts. First, it is shown that the inversion of the cd&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; path guarantees a vertex w such that ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F'', ''F''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''F''[1]...''w''] is a fan and ''d'' is free on&amp;nbsp;''w''. Then, it is shown that the edge coloring is proper and requires at most Δ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 colors.

===Path inversion guarantee===
Prior to the inversion, there are two cases:

# The fan has no edge colored ''d''. Since ''F'' is a maximal fan and ''d'' is free on ''F''[''k''], this implies there is no edge with color ''d'' adjacent to ''u'', otherwise, if there was, this edge would be after ''F''[''k''], as ''d'' is free on ''F''[''k''], but ''F'' was maximal, which is a contradiction. Thus, ''d'' is free on ''u'', and since ''c'' is also free on ''u'', the ''cd''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; path is empty and the inversion has no effect on the graph. Set ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''[''k''].
#The fan has one edge with color ''d''. Let (u,F[x+1]) be this edge. Note that ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;1 since (u,F[1]) is uncolored. Thus, ''d'' is free on ''F''[''x'']. Also, ''x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''k'' since the fan has length ''k'' but there exists a ''F''[''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1]. We can now show that after the inversion, for each ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''k''}, the color of (''F''[''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1],&amp;nbsp;''u'') is free on F[y]. Note that prior to the inversion, the color of (''u'',&amp;nbsp;''F''[''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1]) is not ''c'' or ''d'', since ''c'' is free on ''u'' and (''u'',&amp;nbsp;''F''[''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1]) has color ''d'' and the coloring is valid. The inversion only affects edges that are colored ''c'' or ''d'', so (1) holds.
''F''[''x''] can either be in the ''cd''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; path or not. If it is not, then the inversion will not affect the set of free colors on ''F''[''x''], and ''d'' will remain free on it. We can set ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''[''x'']. Otherwise, we can show that ''F'' is still a fan and ''d'' remains free on ''F''[''k'']. Since ''d'' was free on ''F''[''x''] before the inversion and ''F''[''x''] is on the path, ''F''[''x''] is an endpoint of the ''cd''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; path and ''c'' will be free on ''F''[''x''] after the inversion. The inversion will change the color of (''u'',&amp;nbsp;''F''[''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1]) from ''d'' to ''c''. Thus, since ''c'' is now free on ''F''[''x''] and (1) holds, ''F'' remains a fan. Also, ''d'' remains free on ''F''[''k''], since ''F''[''k''] is not on the ''cd''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; path (suppose that it is; since ''d'' is free on ''F''[''k''], then it would have to be an endpoint of the path, but ''u'' and ''F''[''x''] are the endpoints). Select ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''[''k''].

In any case, the fan ''F''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a prefix of ''F'', which implies ''F''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is also a fan.

===The edge coloring is proper===
This can be shown by [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the number of colored edges. Base case: no edge is colored, this is valid. Induction step: suppose this was true at the end of the previous iteration. In the current iteration, after inverting the path, ''d'' will be free on ''u'', and by the previous result, it will also be free on ''w''. Rotating ''F''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; does not compromises the validity of the coloring. Thus, after setting ''c''(''u'',''w'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''d'', the coloring is still valid.

===The algorithm requires at most Δ + 1 colors===
In a given step, only colors ''c'' and ''d'' are used. Since ''u'' is adjacent to at least one uncolored edge and its degree is bounded by Δ, at least one color in {1,...,Δ} is available for&amp;nbsp;''c''. For ''d'', ''F''[''k''] may have degree Δ and no uncolored adjacent edge. Thus, a color Δ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 may be required.

==Complexity==
At each step, the rotation uncolors the edge (u,w) while coloring edges (u,F[1]) and (u,v) which was previously uncolored. Thus, one additional edge gets colored. Hence, the loop will run &lt;math&gt;O(|E|)&lt;/math&gt; times. Finding the maximal fan, the colors c and d and invert the cd&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; path can be done in &lt;math&gt;O(|V|)&lt;/math&gt; time. Finding w and rotating F' takes &lt;math&gt;O(\deg(u))\in O(|V|)&lt;/math&gt; time. Finding and removing the edge (u,v) can be done using a stack in constant time (pop the last element) and this stack can be populated in &lt;math&gt;O(|E|)&lt;/math&gt; time. Thus, each iteration of the loop takes &lt;math&gt;O(|V|)&lt;/math&gt; time, and the total running time is &lt;math&gt;O(|E|+|E||V|)=O(|E||V|)&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''multifractal system''' is a generalization of a [[fractal]] system in which a single exponent (the [[fractal dimension]]) is not enough to describe its dynamics; instead, a continuous spectrum of exponents (the so-called [[singularity spectrum]]) is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harte | first = David | title = Multifractals | publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall | location = London | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1-58488-154-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multifractal analysis uses mathematical basis to investigate datasets, often in conjunction with other methods of [[fractal analysis]] and [[lacunarity]] analysis. The technique entails distorting datasets extracted from patterns to generate multifractal spectra that illustrate how scaling varies over the dataset.

== Definition ==
In a multifractal system &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the behavior around any point is described by a local [[power law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;s(\vec{x}+\vec{a})-s(\vec{x}) \sim a^{h(\vec{x})}.&lt;/math&gt;

The exponent &lt;math&gt;h(\vec{x})&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[singularity exponent]], as it describes the local degree of [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] or regularity around the point &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The ensemble formed by all the points that share the same singularity exponent is called the ''singularity manifold of exponent h'', and is a [[fractal set]] of [[fractal dimension]] &lt;math&gt;D(h)&lt;/math&gt;: the singularity spectrum. The curve &lt;math&gt;D(h)&lt;/math&gt; versus h is called the ''singularity spectrum'' and fully describes the (statistical) distribution of the variable &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In practice, the multifractal behaviour of a physical system &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not directly characterized by its singularity spectrum &lt;math&gt;D(h)&lt;/math&gt;. Data analysis rather gives access to the ''multiscaling exponents'' &lt;math&gt;\zeta(q),\ q\in{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, multifractal signals generally obey a ''scale invariance'' property which yields power law behaviours for multiresolution quantities depending on their scale &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Depending on the object under study, these multiresolution quantities, denoted by &lt;math&gt;T_X(a)&lt;/math&gt; in the following, can be local averages in boxes of size &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, gradients over distance &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, wavelet coefficients at scale &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;... For multifractal objects, one usually observes a global power law scaling of the form:{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

:&lt;math&gt;\langle T_X(a)^q \rangle \sim a^{\zeta(q)}\ &lt;/math&gt;

at least in some range of scales and for some range of orders &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. When such a behaviour is observed, one talks of scale invariance, self-similarity or multiscaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A.J. Roberts and A. Cronin |title=Unbiased estimation of multi-fractal dimensions of finite data sets |journal=Physica A |volume=233 |year=1996 |pages=867–878 |doi=10.1016/S0378-4371(96)00165-3 |arxiv=chao-dyn/9601019 |bibcode=1996PhyA..233..867R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimation ==

Using the so-called ''multifractal formalism'', it can be shown that, under some well-suited assumptions, there exists a correspondence between the singularity spectrum &lt;math&gt;D(h)&lt;/math&gt; and the multiscaling exponents &lt;math&gt;\zeta(q)&lt;/math&gt; through a [[Legendre transform]]. While the determination of &lt;math&gt;D(h)&lt;/math&gt; calls for some exhaustive local analysis of the data, which would result in difficult and numerically unstable calculations, the estimation of the &lt;math&gt;\zeta(q)&lt;/math&gt; relies on the use of statistical averages and linear regressions in log-log diagrams. Once the &lt;math&gt;\zeta(q)&lt;/math&gt; are known, one can deduce an estimate of &lt;math&gt;D(h)&lt;/math&gt; thanks to a simple Legendre transform.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Multifractal systems are often modeled by stochastic processes such as [[multiplicative cascade]]s. The &lt;math&gt;\zeta(q)&lt;/math&gt; receives some statistical interpretation as they characterize the evolution of the distributions of the &lt;math&gt;T_X(a)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; goes from larger to smaller scales. This evolution is often called ''statistical intermittency'' and betrays a departure from [[Gaussian]] models.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Modelling as a [[multiplicative cascade]] also leads to estimation of multifractal properties ({{harvnb|Roberts|Cronin|1996}}).  This methods works reasonably well even for relatively small datasets  A maximum likelihood fit of a multiplicative cascade to the dataset not only estimates the complete spectrum, but also gives reasonable estimates of the errors (see the web service [http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/multifractal.php]).

== Practical application of multifractal spectra ==
[[File:Distort.png|thumb|Multifractal analysis is analogous to viewing a dataset through a series of distorting lenses to home in on differences in scaling. The pattern shown is a [[Hénon map]]]]

This is done using graphs known as '''multifractal spectra''', analogous to viewing the dataset through a "distorting lens" as shown in the [[#distort|illustration]].&lt;ref name="bcmf"/&gt;  Several types of multifractal spectra are used in practise.

=== D&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; vs Q ===
{{anchor|dqvsq}}[[File:Dqvsq.png|thumb|D&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; vs Q spectra for a non-fractal circle (empirical box counting dimension = 1.0), mono-fractal [[List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension#cross|Quadric Cross]] (empirical box counting dimension = 1.49), and multifractal [[Hénon map]] (empirical box counting dimension = 1.29).]]

{{anchor|dimensional ordering}}One practical multifractal spectrum is the graph of D&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; vs Q, where D&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''generalized dimension''' for a dataset and Q is an arbitrary set of exponents. The expression ''generalized dimension'' thus refers to a set of dimensions for a dataset (detailed calculations for determining the generalized dimension using [[box counting]] are described [[#generalized dimension|below]]).

==== Dimensional ordering ====
The general pattern of the graph of D&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; vs Q can be used to assess the scaling in a pattern.  The graph is generally decreasing, sigmoidal around Q=0, where D&lt;sub&gt;(Q=0)&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ D&lt;sub&gt;(Q=1)&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ D&lt;sub&gt;(Q=2)&lt;/sub&gt;. As illustrated in the [[#dqvsq|figure]], variation in this graphical spectrum can help distinguish patterns. The image shows D&lt;sub&gt;(Q)&lt;/sub&gt; spectra from a multifractal analysis of binary images of non-, mono-, and multi-fractal sets. As is the case in the sample images, non- and mono-fractals tend to have flatter D&lt;sub&gt;(Q)&lt;/sub&gt; spectra than multifractals.

The generalized dimension also offers some important specific information. D&lt;sub&gt;(Q=0)&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the [[capacity dimension]], which in the analysis shown in the figures here is the [[box counting dimension]]. D&lt;sub&gt;(Q=1)&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the [[information dimension]], and D&lt;sub&gt;(Q=2)&lt;/sub&gt; to the [[correlation dimension]]. This relates to the "multi" in multifractal whereby multifractals have multiple dimensions in the D&lt;sub&gt;(Q)&lt;/sub&gt; vs Q spectra but monofractals stay rather flat in that area.&lt;ref name="bcmf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chaabra"/&gt;

=== &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ===
Another useful multifractal spectrum is the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (see [[#calculations|calculations]]). These graphs generally rise to a maximum that approximates the [[fractal dimension]] at Q=0, and then fall. Like D&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; vs Q spectra, they also show typical patterns useful for comparing non-, mono-, and multi-fractal patterns. In particular, for these spectra, non- and mono-fractals converge on certain values, whereas the spectra from multifractal patterns are typically humped over a broader extent.

=== Generalized dimensions of species abundance distributions in space ===
One application of  D&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; vs q in ecology is the characterization of the abundance distribution of species. Traditionally the [[relative species abundance]]s is calculated for an area without taking into account the positions of the individuals. An equivalent representation of relative species abundances are species ranks, used to generate a surface called the species-rank surface,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saravia|first=Leonardo A.|date=2015-08-01|title=A new method to analyse species abundances in space using generalized dimensions|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/745v5/|journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|pages=n/a-n/a|doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12417|issn=2041-210X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be analyzed using generalized dimensions to detect different ecological mechanisms like the ones observed in [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|neutral theory of biodiversity]], [[Metacommunity|metacommunity dynamics]] or [[Ecological niche|niche theory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = mfSBA: Multifractal analysis of spatial patterns in ecological communities|url = http://f1000research.com/articles/3-14/v2|journal = F1000Research|date = 2014-01-01|pmc = 4197745|pmid = 25324962|doi = 10.12688/f1000research.3-14.v2|first = Leonardo A.|last = Saravia|volume=3|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimating multifractal scaling from box counting ==
{{anchor|calculations}}
Multifractal spectra can be determined from [[box counting]] on digital images. First, a box counting scan is done to determine how the pixels are distributed; then, this "mass distribution" becomes the basis for a series of calculations.&lt;ref name="bcmf"&gt;{{citation |author=Karperien, A |title=What are Multifractals? |publisher=ImageJ |accessdate=2012-02-10 |url=http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/Multifractals.htm |year=2002 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65LENzkV8?url=http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/Multifractals.htm |archivedate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chaabra"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chhabra | first1 = A. | last2 = Jensen | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.62.1327 | title = Direct determination of the f(α) singularity spectrum | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 62 | issue = 12 | pages = 1327–1330 | year = 1989 | pmid =  10039645| pmc = |bibcode = 1989PhRvL..62.1327C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Posadas | first1 = A.

''NB: For mono[[fractals]], in contrast, the exponent does not change meaningfully over the set.'' &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from the box counting pixel distribution as in {{EquationNote|Eq.2.0}}. 
 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_{[i,\epsilon]} \varpropto \epsilon^{-\alpha_i} \therefore\alpha_i \varpropto \frac{\log{P_{[i,\epsilon]}}}{\log{\epsilon^{-1}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.0.0}}}}

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = an arbitrary scale ([[Box counting|box size]] in box counting) at which the set is examined

:&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; = the index for each box laid over the set for an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m_{[i,\epsilon]}&lt;/math&gt; = the number of pixels or ''mass'' in any box, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, at size &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = the total boxes that contained more than 0 pixels, for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;M_\epsilon = \sum_{i=1}^{N_\epsilon}m_{[i,\epsilon]} = &lt;/math&gt; the total mass or sum of pixels in all boxes for this &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1.0}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_{[i,\epsilon]} = \frac{m_{[i,\epsilon]}}{M_\epsilon} = &lt;/math&gt; the probability of this mass at &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; relative to the total mass for a box size|{{EquationRef|Eq.2.0}}}}

&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is used to observe how the pixel distribution behaves when distorted in certain ways as in {{EquationNote|Eq.3.0}} and {{EquationNote|Eq.3.1}}:

:&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; = an arbitrary range of values to use as exponents for distorting the data set

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;I_{{(Q)}_{[\epsilon]}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_\epsilon} {P_{[i,\epsilon]}^Q} = &lt;/math&gt; the sum of all mass probabilities distorted by being raised to this Q, for this box size|{{EquationRef |Eq.3.0}}}}
:*When &lt;math&gt;Q=1&lt;/math&gt;, {{EquationNote|Eq.3.0}} equals 1, the usual sum of all probabilities, and when &lt;math&gt;Q=0&lt;/math&gt;, every term is equal to 1, so the sum is equal to the number of boxes counted, &lt;math&gt;N_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mu_{{(Q)}_{[i,\epsilon]}} = \frac{P_{[i,\epsilon]}^Q}{I_{{(Q)}_{[\epsilon]}}} = &lt;/math&gt; how the distorted mass probability at a box compares to the distorted sum over all boxes at this box size|{{EquationRef|Eq.3.1}}}}

These distorting equations are further used to address how the set behaves when scaled or resolved or cut up into a series of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-sized pieces and distorted by Q, to find different values for the dimension of the set, as in the following:

:*An important feature of {{EquationNote|Eq.3.0}} is that it can also be seen to vary according to scale raised to the exponent &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in {{EquationNote|Eq.4.0}}:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;I_{{(Q)}_{[\epsilon]}} \varpropto \epsilon^{\tau_{(Q)}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.4.0}}}}

Thus, a series of values for &lt;math&gt;\tau_{(Q)} &lt;/math&gt; can be found from the slopes of the regression line for the log of {{EquationNote|Eq.3.0}} versus the log of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, based on {{EquationNote|Eq.4.1}}:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\tau_{(Q)} = {\lim_{\epsilon\to0}{\left[ \frac {\log{I_{{(Q)}_{[\epsilon]}}}} {\log{\epsilon}} \right ]}} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.4.1}}}}
 
:*{{anchor|generalized dimension}}For the generalized dimension:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;D_{(Q)} = {\lim_{\epsilon\to0} { \left [ \frac{\log{I_{{(Q)}_{[\epsilon]}}}}{\log{\epsilon^{-1}}} \right ]}} {(1-Q)^{-1}} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.5.0}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\tau_{(Q)} = \alpha_{(Q)}Q - f_{\left(\alpha_{(Q)}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.5.3}}}}

:*&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{(Q)}&lt;/math&gt; is estimated as the slope of the regression line for {{math|log A&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;,Q&lt;/sub&gt;}} versus {{math|log &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;}} where:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;A_{\epsilon,Q} =  \sum_{i=1}^{N_\epsilon}{\mu_{{i,\epsilon}_{Q}}{P_{{i,\epsilon}_{Q}}}} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.6.0}}}}
:*Then &lt;math&gt;f_{\left(\alpha_{{(Q)}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt; is found from {{EquationNote|Eq.5.3}}.

:*The mean &lt;math&gt;\tau_{(Q)}&lt;/math&gt; is estimated as the slope of the log-log regression line for &lt;math&gt;\tau_{{(Q)}_{[\epsilon]}}&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\tau_{(Q)_{[\epsilon]}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N_\epsilon} {P_{[i,\epsilon]}^{Q-1}}}  {N_\epsilon} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.6.1}}}}

In practice, the probability distribution depends on how the dataset is sampled, so optimizing algorithms have been developed to ensure adequate sampling.&lt;ref name="bcmf"/&gt;

{{distinguish|text=the symbol denoting a [[mathematical operation]] or [[mathematical symbol]]}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''operator''' is generally a [[Map_(mathematics)|mapping]] that acts on elements of a [[space (mathematics)|space]] to produce other elements of the same space. The most common operators are [[linear map]]s, which act on [[vector space]]s. However, when using "linear operator" instead of "linear map", mathematicians often mean actions on vector spaces of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, which also preserve other properties, such as [[continuous function|continuity]]. For example, [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] and [[indefinite integration]] are linear operators; operators that are built from them are called [[differential operator]]s, [[integral operator]]s or [[integro-differential operator]]s.

'''Operator''' is also used for denoting the symbol of a [[mathematical operation]]. This is related with the meaning of "operator" in [[computer programming]], see [[operator (computer programming)]].

== Linear operators ==
{{Main|Linear operator}}

The most common kind of operator encountered are ''linear operators''. Let ''U'' and ''V'' be vector spaces over a field ''K''. A [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] ''A'': ''U'' → ''V'' is linear if
:&lt;math&gt;A(\alpha \mathbf{x} + \beta \mathbf{y}) = \alpha A \mathbf{x} + \beta A \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;
for all '''x''', '''y''' in ''U'' and for all ''α, β'' in ''K''.  
This means that a linear operator preserves vector space operations, in the sense that it does not matter whether you apply the linear operator before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In more technical words, linear operators are [[morphism]]s between vector spaces.

In finite-dimensional case linear operators can be represented by [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in the following way. Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a field, and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be finite-dimensional vector spaces over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Let us select a basis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{u}_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_m&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Then let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = x^i \mathbf{u}_i&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary vector in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (assuming [[Einstein convention]]), and &lt;math&gt;A: U \to V&lt;/math&gt; be a linear operator. Then
: &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x} = x^i A\mathbf{u}_i = x^i (A\mathbf{u}_i)^j \mathbf{v}_j &lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;a_i^j := (A\mathbf{u}_i)^j \in K&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of the operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in fixed bases. &lt;math&gt;a_i^j&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the choice of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;a_i^j x^i = y^j&lt;/math&gt;. Thus in fixed bases n-by-m matrices are in bijective correspondence to linear operators from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

The important concepts directly related to operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces are the ones of [[Matrix rank|rank]], [[determinant]], [[inverse operator]], and [[eigenspace]].

Linear operators also play a great role in the infinite-dimensional case. The concepts of rank and determinant cannot be extended to infinite-dimensional matrices. This is why very different techniques are employed when studying linear operators (and operators in general) in the infinite-dimensional case. The study of linear operators in the infinite-dimensional case is known as [[functional analysis]] (so called because various classes of functions form interesting examples of infinite-dimensional vector spaces).

The space of [[sequence]]s of real numbers, or more generally sequences of vectors in any vector space, themselves form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The most important cases are sequences of real or complex numbers, and these spaces, together with linear subspaces, are known as [[sequence space]]s. Operators on these spaces are known as [[sequence transformation]]s.

Bounded linear operators over [[Banach space]] form a [[Banach algebra]] in respect to the standard operator norm. The theory of Banach algebras develops a very general concept of [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectra]] that elegantly generalizes the theory of eigenspaces.

== Bounded operators==
{{Main|bounded operator|operator norm|Banach algebra}}

Let ''U'' and ''V'' be two vector spaces over the same [[ordered field]] (for example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;), and they are equipped with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s. Then a linear operator from ''U'' to ''V'' is called '''bounded''' if there exists ''C &gt; 0'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;||A\mathbf{x}||_V \leq C||\mathbf{x}||_U&lt;/math&gt;
for all '''x''' in ''U''.

Bounded operators form a vector space. On this vector space we can introduce a norm that is compatible with the norms of ''U'' and ''V'':
:&lt;math&gt;||A|| = \inf\{C: ||A\mathbf{x}||_V \leq C||\mathbf{x}||_U\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In case of operators from ''U'' to itself it can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;||AB|| \leq ||A||\cdot||B||&lt;/math&gt;.

Any unital [[normed algebra]] with this property is called a [[Banach algebra]]. It is possible to generalize [[spectral theory]] to such algebras. [[C*-algebra]]s, which are [[Banach algebras]] with some additional structure, play an important role in [[quantum mechanics]].

== Examples ==
=== Geometry ===
{{Main|general linear group|isometry}}

In [[geometry]], additional structures on [[vector space]]s are sometimes studied. Operators that map such vector spaces to themselves bijectively are very useful in these studies, they naturally form [[group (mathematics)|group]]s by composition.

For example, bijective operators preserving the structure of a vector space are precisely the [[invertible]] [[linear operator]]s. They form the [[general linear group]] under composition. They ''do not'' form a vector space under the addition of operators, e.g. both ''id'' and ''-id'' are invertible (bijective), but their sum, 0, is not.

Operators preserving the Euclidean metric on such a space form the [[isometry group]], and those that fix the origin form a subgroup known as the [[orthogonal group]]. Operators in the orthogonal group that also preserve the orientation of vector tuples form the [[special orthogonal group]], or the group of rotations.

=== Probability theory ===
{{Main|Probability theory}}

Operators are also involved in probability theory, such as [[expected value|expectation]], [[variance]],  and [[covariance]].{{clarify|reason = Why these are operators?|date=February 2018}}
&lt;!-- if you know it and you know it please expand... --&gt;

=== Calculus ===
{{Main|differential operator|integral operator}}
From the point of view of [[functional analysis]], [[calculus]] is the study of two linear operators: the [[differential operator]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Volterra operator|indefinite integral operator]] &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Fourier series and Fourier transform ====

{{Main|Fourier series|Fourier transform}}

The Fourier transform is useful in applied mathematics, particularly physics and signal processing. It is another integral operator; it is useful mainly because it converts a function on one (temporal) domain to a function on another (frequency) domain, in a way effectively [[invertible]]. No information is lost, as there is an inverse transform operator. In the simple case of [[periodic function]]s, this result is based on the theorem that any continuous periodic function can be represented as the sum of a series of [[sine wave]]s and cosine waves:
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = {a_0 \over 2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{ a_n \cos ( \omega n t ) + b_n \sin ( \omega n t ) } &lt;/math&gt;
The tuple ''(a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...)'' is in fact an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space [[Sequence space|ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], and thus Fourier series is a linear operator.

When dealing with general function '''R''' → '''C''', the transform takes on an [[integral]] form:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = {1 \over \sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty}{g( \omega )e^{ i \omega t } \,d\omega }. &lt;/math&gt;

==== Laplace transform ====

{{Main|Laplace transform}}
The ''Laplace transform'' is another integral operator and is involved in simplifying the process of solving differential equations.

Given ''f'' = ''f''(''s''), it is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f\}(s) =\int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Fundamental operators on scalar and vector fields ===
{{Main|vector calculus|vector field|scalar field|gradient|divergence|curl (mathematics)|l6=curl}}

Three operators are key to [[vector calculus]]:
* Grad ([[gradient]]), (with operator symbol [[Del|&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;]]) assigns a vector at every point in a scalar field that points in the direction of greatest rate of change of that field and whose norm measures the absolute value of that greatest rate of change.
* Div ([[divergence]]), (with operator symbol [[Del#Divergence|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot&lt;/math&gt;]]) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's divergence from or convergence towards a given point.
* [[Curl (mathematics)|Curl]], (with operator symbol [[Del#Curl|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times&lt;/math&gt;]]) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's curling (winding around, rotating around) trend about a given point.

As an extension of vector calculus operators to physics, engineering and tensor spaces, Grad, Div and Curl operators also are often associated with [[Tensor calculus]] as well as vector calculus.&lt;ref name="Vector and Tensor Operators"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 0-393-92516-1 |url= https://www.amazon.com/Div-Grad-Curl-All-That/dp/0393925161/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388768941&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=div+grad+curl |title=Div Grad Cural and All that |author=h.m. schey |location=New York|publisher=W W Norton|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal stopping problems can be found in areas of [[statistics]], [[economics]], and [[mathematical finance]] (related to the pricing of [[American options]]). A key example of an optimal stopping problem is the [[secretary problem]]. Optimal stopping problems can often be written in the form of a [[Bellman equation]], and are therefore often solved using [[dynamic programming]].

==Definition==

===Discrete time case===

Stopping rule problems are associated with two objects:

#A sequence of random variables &lt;math&gt;X_1, X_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, whose joint distribution is something assumed to be known
#A sequence of 'reward' functions &lt;math&gt;(y_i)_{i\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt; which depend on the observed values of the random variables in 1.:
#:&lt;math&gt;y_i=y_i (x_1, \ldots ,x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Given those objects, the problem is as follows:
* You are observing the sequence of random variables, and at each step &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, you can choose to either stop observing or continue
* If you stop observing at step &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, you will receive reward &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;
* You want to choose a [[stopping rule]] to maximise your expected reward (or equivalently, minimise your expected loss)

===Continuous time case===

Consider a gain processes &lt;math&gt;G=(G_t)_{t\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; defined on a [[filtered probability space]] &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\ge 0},\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; and assume that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is [[adapted process|adapted]] to the filtration. The optimal stopping problem is to find the [[stopping time]] &lt;math&gt;\tau^*&lt;/math&gt; which maximizes the expected gain
:&lt;math&gt; V_t^T = \mathbb{E} G_{\tau^*} = \sup_{t\le \tau \le T} \mathbb{E} G_\tau &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_t^T&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[value function]]. Here &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can take value &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

A more specific formulation is as follows. We consider an adapted strong [[Markov process]] &lt;math&gt;X = (X_t)_{t\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; defined on a filtered probability space &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\ge 0},\mathbb{P}_x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}_x&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[probability measure]] where the [[stochastic process]] starts at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Given continuous functions &lt;math&gt;M,L&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, the optimal stopping problem is 
:&lt;math&gt; V(x) = \sup_{0\le \tau \le T} \mathbb{E}_x \left( M(X_\tau) + \int_0^\tau L(X_t) dt + \sup_{0\le t\le\tau} K(X_t) \right). &lt;/math&gt;
This is sometimes called the MLS (which stand for Mayer, Lagrange, and supremum, respectively) formulation.&lt;ref name="opt2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = Goran | last1 = Peskir| first2 = Albert | last2 = Shiryaev | authorlink2 = Albert Shiryaev

==Solution methods==
There are generally two approaches of solving optimal stopping problems.&lt;ref name=opt2006/&gt; When the underlying process (or the gain process) is described by its unconditional [[finite-dimensional distribution]]s, the appropriate solution technique is the martingale approach, so called because it uses [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] theory, the most important concept being the [[Snell envelope]]. In the discrete time case, if the planning horizon &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is finite, the problem can also be easily solved by [[dynamic programming]].

When the underlying process is determined by a family of (conditional) transition functions leading to a Markov family of transition probabilities, powerful analytical tools provided by the theory of [[Markov process]]es can often be utilized and this approach is referred to as the Markov method. The solution is usually obtained by solving the associated [[Free boundary problem|free-boundary problems]] ([[Stefan problem]]s).

==A jump diffusion result==
Let &lt;math&gt;Y_t&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Lévy process|Lévy]] diffusion in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; given by the [[Stochastic differential equation|SDE]]
:&lt;math&gt; dY_t = b(Y_t) dt + \sigma (Y_t) dB_t + \int_{\mathbb{R}^k} \gamma (Y_{t-},z)\bar{N}(dt,dz),\quad Y_0 = y &lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; is an  &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Brownian motion]], &lt;math&gt; \bar{N} &lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt; l &lt;/math&gt;-dimensional compensated [[Poisson random measure]], &lt;math&gt; b:\mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^k &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \sigma:\mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^{k\times m} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \gamma:\mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^{k\times l} &lt;/math&gt; are given functions such that a unique solution &lt;math&gt; (Y_t) &lt;/math&gt; exists. Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}\subset \mathbb{R}^k &lt;/math&gt; be an open set (the solvency region) and 
:&lt;math&gt; \tau_\mathcal{S} = \inf\{ t&gt;0: Y_t \notin \mathcal{S} \} &lt;/math&gt;
be the bankruptcy time. The optimal stopping problem is:
:&lt;math&gt;V(y) = \sup_{\tau \le \tau_\mathcal{S}} J^\tau (y) = \sup_{\tau \le \tau_\mathcal{S}} \mathbb{E}_y \left[ M(Y_\tau) + \int_0^\tau L(Y_t) dt \right]. &lt;/math&gt;
It turns out that under some regularity conditions,&lt;ref name="oksendal2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Øksendal | first1 = B. | authorlink1 = Bernt Øksendal| last2 = Sulem | first2 = A. S. | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-69826-5 | title = Applied Stochastic Control of Jump Diffusions | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-69825-8 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the following verification theorem holds:

If a function &lt;math&gt;\phi:\bar{\mathcal{S}}\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
* &lt;math&gt; \phi \in C(\bar{\mathcal{S}}) \cap C^1(\mathcal{S}) \cap C^2(\mathcal{S}\setminus \partial D) &lt;/math&gt; where the continuation region is &lt;math&gt; D = \{y\in\mathcal{S}: \phi(y) &gt; M(y) \} &lt;/math&gt;, 
* &lt;math&gt; \phi \ge M &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt;, and
* &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}\phi + L \le 0 &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} \setminus \partial D &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)|infinitesimal generator]] of &lt;math&gt; (Y_t) &lt;/math&gt; 
then &lt;math&gt; \phi(y) \ge V(y) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; y\in \bar{\mathcal{S}} &lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, if
* &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}\phi + L = 0 &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt; \phi(y) = V(y) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; y\in \bar{\mathcal{S}} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \tau^* = \inf\{ t&gt;0: Y_t\notin D\} &lt;/math&gt; is an optimal stopping time.

These conditions can also be written is a more compact form (the [[Variational inequality|integro-variational inequality]]):
* &lt;math&gt; \max\left\{ \mathcal{A}\phi + L, M-\phi \right\} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} \setminus \partial D. &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

=== Coin tossing ===
(Example where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}(y_i)&lt;/math&gt; converges)

You have a fair coin and are repeatedly tossing it. Each time, before it is tossed, you can choose to stop tossing it and get paid (in dollars, say) the average number of heads observed.

You wish to maximise the amount you get paid by choosing a stopping rule.
If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (for ''i'' ≥ 1) forms a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables with [[Bernoulli distribution]]
: &lt;math&gt;\text{Bern}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
and if
: &lt;math&gt;y_i = \frac 1 i \sum_{k=1}^{i} X_k&lt;/math&gt;
then the sequences &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\geq 1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(y_i)_{i\geq 1}&lt;/math&gt; are the objects associated with this problem.

=== House selling ===
(Example where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}(y_i)&lt;/math&gt; does not necessarily converge)

You have a house and wish to sell it. Each day you are offered &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; for your house, and pay &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to continue advertising it. If you sell your house on day &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, you will earn &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y_n = (X_n - nk)&lt;/math&gt;.

You wish to maximise the amount you earn by choosing a stopping rule.

In this example, the sequence (&lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;) is the sequence of offers for your house, and the sequence of reward functions is how much you will earn.

=== Secretary problem ===
{{Main|Secretary problem}}
(Example where &lt;math&gt;(X_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite sequence)

You are observing a sequence of objects which can be ranked from best to worst. You wish to choose a stopping rule which maximises your chance of picking the best object.

Here, if &lt;math&gt;R_1, \ldots, R_n&lt;/math&gt; (''n'' is some large number) are the ranks of the objects, and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the chance you pick the best object if you stop intentionally rejecting objects at step i, then &lt;math&gt;(R_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_i)&lt;/math&gt; are the sequences associated with this problem. This problem was solved in the early 1960s by several people. An elegant solution to the secretary problem and several modifications of this problem is provided by the more recent [[odds algorithm]]
of optimal stopping (Bruss algorithm).

=== Search theory ===
{{Main|Search theory}}
Economists have studied a number of optimal stopping problems similar to the 'secretary problem', and typically call this type of analysis 'search theory'. Search theory has especially focused on a worker's search for a high-wage job, or a consumer's search for a low-priced good.

=== Option trading ===
In the trading of [[Option (finance)|options]] on [[financial market]]s, the holder of an [[Option style|American option]] is allowed to exercise the right to buy (or sell) the underlying asset at a predetermined price at any time before or at the expiry date. Therefore, the valuation of American options is essentially an optimal stopping problem. Consider a classical [[Black-Scholes]] set-up and let &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; be the [[risk-free interest rate]] and &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; be the dividend rate and volatility of the stock. The stock price &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; follows geometric Brownian motion
:&lt;math&gt; S_t = S_0 \exp\left\{ \left(r - \delta - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right) t + \sigma B_t \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
under the risk-neutral measure. 

When the option is perpetual, the optimal stopping problem is
:&lt;math&gt; V(x) = \sup_{\tau} \mathbb{E}_x \left[ e^{-r\tau} g(S_\tau) \right] &lt;/math&gt;
where the payoff function is &lt;math&gt; g(x) = (x-K)^+ &lt;/math&gt; for a call option and &lt;math&gt; g(x) = (K-x)^+ &lt;/math&gt; for a put option. The variational inequality is
:&lt;math&gt; \max\left\{ \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 x^2 V''(x) + (r-\delta) x V'(x) - rV(x), g(x) - V(x) \right\} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x \in (0,\infty)\setminus \{b\}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; is the exercise boundary. The solution is known to be&lt;ref name="karatzas1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = Ioannis| last1 = Karatzas| first2 = Steven E.| last2 = Shreve| authorlink2 = Steven E. Shreve| doi = 10.1007/b98840 | title = Methods of Mathematical Finance | series = Stochastic Modelling and Applied Probability | volume = 39 | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-387-94839-3 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* (Perpetual call) &lt;math&gt; V(x) = \begin{cases} (b-K)(x/b)^\gamma &amp; x\in(0,b) \\ x-K &amp; x\in[b,\infty)  \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \gamma = (\sqrt{\nu^2 + 2r} - \nu) / \sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \nu = (r-\delta)/\sigma - \sigma / 2, \quad b = \gamma K / (\gamma - 1). &lt;/math&gt;
* (Perpetual put) &lt;math&gt; V(x) = \begin{cases} K - x &amp; x\in(0,c] \\(K-c)(x/c)^\tilde{\gamma} &amp; x\in(c,\infty)  \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\gamma} = -(\sqrt{\nu^2 + 2r} + \nu) / \sigma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \nu = (r-\delta)/\sigma - \sigma / 2, \quad c = \tilde{\gamma} K / (\tilde{\gamma} - 1). &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, when the expiry date is finite, the problem is associated with a 2-dimensional free-boundary problem with no known closed-form solution. Various numerical methods can however be used. See [[Black–Scholes model #American options]] for various valuation methods here, as well as [[Fugit]] for a discrete, [[Lattice model (finance)|tree based]], calculation of the optimal time to exercise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3917">In [[linear algebra]], an '''orthogonal transformation''' is a [[linear transformation]] ''T''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''V''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''V'' on a real [[inner product space]] ''V'', that preserves the inner product. That is, for each pair {{nowrap|1=''u'', ''v''}} of elements of&amp;nbsp;''V'', we have&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowland|first=Todd|title=Orthogonal Transformation |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrthogonalTransformation.html|publisher=MathWorld|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \langle u,v \rangle = \langle Tu,Tv \rangle \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Since the lengths of vectors and the angles between them are defined through the inner product, orthogonal transformations preserve lengths of vectors and angles between them. In particular, orthogonal transformations map [[orthonormal basis|orthonormal bases]] to orthonormal bases.

Orthogonal transformations in two- or three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] are stiff [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]], or combinations of a rotation and a reflection (also known as [[improper rotation]]s). Reflections are transformations that exchange left and right, similar to mirror images. The matrices corresponding to proper rotations (without reflection) have [[determinant]]&amp;nbsp;+1. Transformations with reflection are represented by matrices with determinant&amp;nbsp;−1. This allows the concept of rotation and reflection to be generalized to higher dimensions.

In finite-dimensional spaces, the matrix representation (with respect to an [[orthonormal basis]]) of an orthogonal transformation is an [[orthogonal matrix]]. Its rows are mutually orthogonal vectors with unit norm, so that the rows constitute an orthonormal basis of&amp;nbsp;''V''. The columns of the matrix form another orthonormal basis of&amp;nbsp;''V''.

The inverse of an orthogonal transformation is another orthogonal transformation. Its matrix representation is the transpose of the matrix representation of the original transformation.

==Examples==
Consider the inner-product space &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^2,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; with the standard euclidean inner product and standard basis. Then, the matrix transformation
:&lt;math&gt;
T = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) &amp; -\sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) &amp; \cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix} : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2
&lt;/math&gt;
is orthogonal. To see this, consider
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Te_1 = \begin{bmatrix}\cos(\theta) \\ \sin(\theta)\end{bmatrix} &amp;&amp; Te_2 = \begin{bmatrix}-\sin(\theta) \\ \cos(\theta)\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\langle Te_1,Te_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) &amp; \sin(\theta) \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) \\ \sin(\theta) \end{bmatrix} = \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1\\
&amp;\langle Te_1,Te_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) &amp; \sin(\theta) \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} -\sin(\theta) \\ \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix} = \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) - \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) = 0\\
&amp;\langle Te_2,Te_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\sin(\theta) &amp; \cos(\theta)  \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} -\sin(\theta) \\ \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix} = \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The previous example can be extended to construct all orthogonal transformations. For example, the following matrices define orthogonal transformations on &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^3,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) &amp; -\sin(\theta) &amp; 0 \\
\sin(\theta) &amp; \cos(\theta) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) &amp; 0 &amp; -\sin(\theta) \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\sin(\theta) &amp; 0 &amp; \cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos(\theta) &amp; -\sin(\theta) \\
0 &amp; \sin(\theta) &amp; \cos(\theta) 
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[computational geometry]], a '''planar straight-line graph''', in short ''PSLG'', (or ''straight-line plane graph'', or ''plane straight-line graph'') is a term used for an [[Graph embedding|embedding]] of a [[planar graph]] in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] such that its edges are mapped into straight line segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author = [[Franco P. Preparata]] and [[Michael Ian Shamos]] | title = Computational Geometry - An Introduction | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| year = 1985 | id = 1st edition: {{isbn|0-387-96131-3}}; 2nd printing, corrected and expanded, 1988: {{isbn|3-540-96131-3}}; Russian translation, 1989: {{isbn|5-03-001041-6}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fáry's theorem]] (1948) states that every planar graph has this kind of embedding.

In computational geometry, PSLGs have often been called '''planar subdivisions''', with an assumption or assertion that subdivisions are polygonal{{clarify|reason=What is a polygonal subdivision?|date=March 2018}}.

A PSLG without vertices of degree 1 defines a subdivision of the plane into [[polygonal region]]s and vice versa. The absence of vertices of degree 1 simplifies descriptions of various [[algorithm]]s, but it is not essential{{why|date=March 2018}}. 

PSLGs may serve as representations of various [[map]]s, e.g., [[geographical map]]s in [[geographical information systems]]{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

Special cases of PSLGs are triangulations ([[polygon triangulation]], [[point set triangulation]]). Point set triangulations are maximal PSLGs in the sense that it is impossible to add straight edges to them while keeping the graph planar. Triangulations have numerous applications in various areas.

PSLGs may be seen as a special kind of [[Euclidean graph]]s. However, in discussions involving Euclidean graphs, the primary interest is their metric properties, i.e., distances between vertices, while for PSLGs the primary interest is the topological properties. For some graphs, such as [[Delaunay triangulation]]s, both  metric and topological properties are of importance.

==Problems in terms of PSLG==
*[[Point location]]. For a query point, find which face of the PSLG it belongs to.
*[[Map overlay]]. Find the overlay of two PSLGs (maps), which is the subdivision of the plane by the two simultaneously embedded PSLGs. In GIS this problem is known as "[[thematic map]] overlay".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1163">In [[mathematics]], in the realm of [[abstract algebra]], a '''radical polynomial''' is a multivariate [[polynomial]] over a field that can be expressed as a polynomial in the sum of squares of the variables. That is, if 

:&lt;math&gt;k[x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; 

is a [[polynomial ring]], the ring of radical polynomials is the subring generated by the polynomial 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Radical polynomials are characterized as precisely those polynomials that are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under the action of the [[orthogonal group]].

The ring of radical polynomials is a [[graded algebra|graded subalgebra]] of the ring of all polynomials.

The standard [[separation of variables theorem]] asserts that every polynomial can be expressed as a finite sum of terms, each term being a product of a radical polynomial and a [[harmonic polynomial]]. This is equivalent to the statement that the ring of all polynomials is a [[free module]] over the ring of radical polynomials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12693">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''residuated lattice''' is an [[algebraic structure]] that is simultaneously a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and a [[monoid]] ''x''•''y'' which admits operations ''x''\''z'' and ''z''/''y'', loosely analogous to division or implication, when ''x''•''y'' is viewed as multiplication or conjunction, respectively.  Called respectively right and left residuals, these operations coincide when the monoid is commutative.  The general concept was introduced by Ward and Dilworth in 1939.  Examples, some of which existed prior to the general concept, include [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s, [[Heyting algebra]]s, [[residuated Boolean algebra]]s, [[relation algebra]]s, and [[MV-algebra]]s.  [[Residuated lattice#Residuated semilattice|Residuated semilattices]] omit the meet operation &amp;and;, for example [[Kleene algebra]]s and [[action algebra]]s.

==Definition==

In [[mathematics]], a '''residuated lattice''' is an [[algebraic structure]] '''L''' = (''L'', ≤, •, '''I''') such that
:  (i) (''L'', ≤) is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]].
: (ii) (''L'', •, '''I''') is a [[monoid]].
:(iii)  For all ''z'' there exists for every ''x'' a greatest ''y'', and for every ''y'' a greatest ''x'', such that ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' (the residuation properties).

In (iii), the "greatest ''y''", being a function of ''z'' and ''x'', is denoted ''x''\''z'' and called the '''right residual''' of ''z'' by ''x''. Think of it as what remains of ''z'' on the right after "dividing" ''z'' on the left by ''x''.  Dually, the "greatest ''x''" is denoted ''z''/''y'' and called the '''left residual''' of ''z'' by ''y''.  An equivalent, more formal statement of (iii) that uses these operations to name these greatest values is

(iii)'  for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''L'', &amp;nbsp; ''y'' ≤ ''x''\''z'' &amp;nbsp; ⇔ &amp;nbsp; ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' &amp;nbsp; ⇔ &amp;nbsp; ''x'' ≤ ''z''/''y''.

As suggested by the notation, the residuals are a form of quotient.  More precisely, for a given ''x'' in ''L'', the unary operations ''x''• and ''x''\ are respectively the lower and upper adjoints of a [[Galois connection]] on '''L''', and dually for the two functions •''y'' and /''y''.  By the same reasoning that applies to any Galois connection, we have yet another definition of the residuals, namely,
:''x''•(''x''\''y'') ≤ ''y'' ≤ ''x''\(''x''•''y''), and
:(''y''/''x'')•''x'' ≤ ''y'' ≤ (''y''•''x'')/''x'',

together with the requirement that ''x''•''y'' be monotone in ''x'' and ''y''.  (When axiomatized using (iii) or (iii)' monotonicity becomes a theorem and hence not required in the axiomatization.)  These give a sense in which the functions ''x''• and ''x''\ are pseudoinverses or adjoints of each other, and likewise for •''x'' and /''x''.

This last definition is purely in terms of inequalities, noting that monotonicity can be axiomatized as ''x''•''y'' ≤ (''x''&amp;or;''z'')•''y'' and similarly for the other operations and their arguments.  Moreover, any inequality ''x'' ≤ ''y'' can be expressed equivalently as an equation, either ''x''&amp;and;''y'' = ''x'' or ''x''&amp;or;''y'' = ''y''.  This along with the equations axiomatizing lattices and monoids then yields a purely equational definition of residuated lattices, provided the requisite operations are adjoined to the signature (''L'', ≤, •, '''I''') thereby expanding it to (''L'', &amp;and;, &amp;or;, •, '''I''', /, \).  When thus organized, residuated lattices form an equational class or [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]], whose homomorphisms respect the residuals as well as the lattice and monoid operations.  Note that distributivity ''x''•(''y''&amp;or;''z'') = (''x''•''y'') &amp;or; (''x''•''z'') and ''x''•0 = 0 are consequences of these axioms and so do not need to be made part of the definition.  This necessary distributivity of • over &amp;or; does not in general entail distributivity of &amp;and; over &amp;or;, that is, a residuated lattice need not be a distributive lattice.  However it does do so when • and &amp;and; are the same operation, a special case of residuated lattices called a [[Heyting algebra]].
  
Alternative notations for ''x''•''y'' include ''x''&amp;#9702;''y'', ''x'';''y'' ([[relation algebra]]), and ''x''⊗''y'' ([[linear logic]]).  Alternatives for '''I''' include ''e'' and 1'.  Alternative notations for the residuals are ''x'' → ''y'' for ''x''\''y'' and ''y'' ← ''x'' for ''y''/''x'', suggested by the similarity between residuation and implication in logic, with the multiplication of the monoid understood as a form of conjunction that need not be commutative.  When the monoid is commutative the two residuals coincide.  When not commutative, the intuitive meaning of the monoid as conjunction and the residuals as implications can be understood as having a temporal quality: ''x''•''y'' means ''x'' ''and then'' ''y'', &amp;nbsp; ''x'' → ''y'' means ''had'' ''x'' (in the past) ''then'' ''y'' (now), &amp;nbsp; and ''y'' ← ''x'' means ''if-ever'' ''x'' (in the future) ''then'' ''y'' (at that time), as illustrated by the natural language example at the end of the examples.

== Examples ==
One of the original motivations for the study of residuated lattices was the lattice of (two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Given a ring ''R'', the ideals of ''R'', denoted Id(''R''), forms a complete lattice with set intersection acting as the meet operation and "ideal addition" acting as the join operation. The monoid operation • is given by "ideal multiplication", and the element ''R'' of Id(''R'') acts as the identity for this operation. Given two ideals ''A'' and ''B'' in Id(''R''), the residuals are given by
:&lt;math&gt;A/B:= \{r \in R \mid rB \subseteq A \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B\setminus A:=\{ r \in R \mid Br \subseteq A \}&lt;/math&gt;
It is worth noting that {0}/''B'' and ''B''\{0} are respectively the left and right [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilators]] of ''B''. This residuation is related to the ''[[conductor (ring theory)|conductor]]'' (or ''transporter'') in [[commutative algebra]] written as (''A'':''B'')=''A''/''B''. One difference in usage is that ''B'' need not be an ideal of ''R'': it may just be a subset.

[[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and [[Heyting algebras]] are commutative residuated lattices in which ''x''•''y'' = ''x''&amp;and;''y'' (whence the unit '''I''' is the top element 1 of the algebra) and both residuals ''x''\''y'' and ''y''/''x'' are the same operation, namely implication ''x'' → ''y''.  The second example is quite general since Heyting algebras include all finite [[distributive lattice]]s, as well as all chains or [[total order]]s forming a [[complete lattice]], for example the unit interval [0,1] in the real line, or the integers and ±&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The structure ('''Z''', ''min'', ''max'', +, 0, &amp;minus;, &amp;minus;) (the integers with subtraction for both residuals) is a commutative residuated lattice such that the unit of the monoid is not the greatest element (indeed there is no least or greatest integer), and the multiplication of the monoid is not the meet operation of the lattice.  In this example the inequalities are equalities because &amp;minus; (subtraction) is not merely the adjoint or pseudoinverse of + but the true inverse.  Any totally ordered group under addition such as the rationals or the reals can be substituted for the integers in this example.  The nonnegative portion of any of these examples is an example provided ''min'' and ''max'' are interchanged and &amp;minus; is replaced by [[monus]], defined (in this case) so that ''x''-''y'' = 0 when ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and otherwise is ordinary subtraction.

A more general class of examples is given by the [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of all [[binary relations]] on a set ''X'',  namely the power set of ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, made a residuated lattice by taking the monoid multiplication • to be composition of relations and the monoid unit to be the identity relation '''I''' on ''X'' consisting of all pairs (''x'',''x'') for ''x'' in ''X''.  Given two relations ''R'' and ''S'' on ''X'', the right residual ''R''\''S'' of ''S'' by ''R'' is the binary relation such that ''x''(''R''\''S'')''y'' holds just when for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''zRx'' implies ''zSy'' (notice the connection with implication).  The left residual is the mirror image of this: ''y''(''S''/''R'')''x'' holds just when for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''xRz'' implies ''ySz''.

This can be illustrated with the binary relations &lt; and &gt; on {0,1} in which 0 &lt; 1 and 1 &gt; 0 are the only relationships that hold.  Then ''x''(&gt;\&lt;)''y'' holds just when ''x'' = 1, while ''x''(&lt;/&gt;)''y'' holds just when ''y'' = 0, showing that residuation of &lt; by &gt; is different depending on whether we residuate on the right or the left.  This difference is a consequence of the difference between &lt;•&gt; and &gt;•&lt;, where the only relationships that hold are 0(&lt;•&gt;)0 (since 0&lt;1&gt;0) and 1(&gt;•&lt;)1 (since 1&gt;0&lt;1).  Had we chosen ≤ and ≥ instead of &lt; and &gt;, ≥\≤ and ≤/≥ would have been the same because ≤•≥ = ≥•≤, both of which always hold between all ''x'' and ''y'' (since ''x''≤1≥''y'' and ''x''≥0≤''y'').

The Boolean algebra 2&lt;sup&gt;Σ*&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[formal language]]s over an alphabet (set) Σ forms a residuated lattice whose monoid multiplication is language concatenation ''LM'' and whose monoid unit '''I''' is the language {ε} consisting of just the empty string ε.  The right residual ''M''\''L'' consists of all words ''w'' over Σ such that ''Mw'' ⊆ ''L''.  The left residual ''L''/''M'' is the same with ''wM'' in place of ''Mw''.

The residuated lattice of all binary relations on ''X'' is finite just when ''X'' is finite, and commutative just when ''X'' has at most one element.  When ''X'' is empty the algebra is the degenerate Boolean algebra in which 0 = 1 = '''I'''.  The residuated lattice of all languages on Σ is commutative just when Σ has at most one letter.  It is finite just when Σ is empty, consisting of the two languages 0 (the empty language {}) and the monoid unit '''I''' = {ε} = 1.

The examples forming a Boolean algebra have special properties treated in the article on [[residuated Boolean algebra]]s.

In [[natural language]] residuated lattices formalize the logic of "and" when used with its noncommutative meaning of "and then."  Setting ''x'' = ''bet'', ''y'' = ''win'', ''z'' = ''rich'', we can read ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' as "bet and then win entails rich."  By the axioms this is equivalent to ''y'' ≤ ''x''→''z'' meaning "win entails had bet then rich", and also to ''x'' ≤ ''z''←''y'' meaning "bet entails if-ever win then rich."  Humans readily detect such non-sequiturs as "bet entails had win then rich" and "win entails if-ever bet then rich" as both being equivalent to the wishful thinking "win and then bet entails rich."  Humans do not so readily detect that [[Peirce's law]] ((''P''→''Q'')→''P'')→''P'' is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], an interesting situation where humans exhibit more proficiency with nonclassical reasoning than classical.

==Residuated semilattice==
A '''residuated semilattice''' is defined almost identically for residuated lattices, omitting just the meet operation &amp;and;.  Thus it is an [[algebraic structure]] L = (L, ∨, •, 1, /, \) satisfying all the residuated lattice equations as specified above except those containing an occurrence of the symbol &amp;and;.  The option of defining ''x'' ≤ ''y'' as ''x''&amp;and;''y'' = ''x'' is then not available, leaving only the other option ''x''&amp;or;''y'' = ''y'' (or any equivalent thereof).

Any residuated lattice can be made a residuated semilattice simply by omitting &amp;and;.  Residuated semilattices arise in connection with [[action algebra]]s, which are residuated semilattices that are also [[Kleene algebra]]s, for which &amp;and; is ordinarily not required.

In such models key quantities of interest are the probability of ruin, distribution of surplus immediately prior to ruin and deficit at time of ruin.

==Classical model==

[[Image:Samplepathcompoundpoisson.JPG|thumb|right|350px|A sample path of compound Poisson risk process]]

The theoretical foundation of ruin theory, known as the Cramér–Lundberg model (or classical compound-Poisson risk model, classical risk process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Delbaen | first1 = F. | last2 = Haezendonck | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1016/0167-6687(87)90019-9 | title = Classical risk theory in an economic environment | journal = Insurance: Mathematics and Economics | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 85 | year = 1987 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Poisson risk process) was introduced in 1903 by the Swedish actuary [[Filip Lundberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Lundberg, F. (1903) Approximerad Framställning av Sannolikehetsfunktionen, Återförsäkering av Kollektivrisker, Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, Uppsala.&lt;/ref&gt; Lundberg's work was republished in the 1930s by [[Harald Cramér]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Blom | first1 = G. | title = Harald Cramer 1893-1985 | doi = 10.1214/aos/1176350596 | journal = [[The Annals of Statistics]]| volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 1335 | year = 1987 | jstor = 2241677| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model describes an insurance company who experiences two opposing cash flows: incoming cash premiums and outgoing claims. Premiums arrive a constant rate ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 from customers and claims arrive according to a [[Poisson process]] with intensity ''λ'' and are [[independent and identically distributed non-negative random variables]] with distribution ''F'' and mean ''μ'' (they form a [[compound Poisson process]]). So for an insurer who starts with initial surplus ''x'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = A.

:&lt;math&gt;X_t = x + ct - \sum_{i=1}^{N_t} \xi_i \quad \text{ for t} \geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The central object of the model is to investigate the probability that the insurer's surplus level eventually falls below zero (making the firm bankrupt). This quantity, called the probability of ultimate ruin, is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\mathbb{P}^x\{\tau&lt;\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;
where the time of ruin is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tau=\inf\{t&gt;0 \,:\, X(t)&lt;0\}&lt;/math&gt; with the convention that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \inf\varnothing=\infty&lt;/math&gt;. This can be computed exactly using the [[Pollaczek–Khinchine formula]] as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huzak | first1 = Miljenko | last2 = Perman | first2 = Mihael | last3 = Šikić | first3 = Hrvoje | last4 = Vondraček | first4 = Zoran | year = 2004 | title = Ruin Probabilities for Competing Claim Processes | journal = Journal of Applied Probability | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 679–690 | publisher = [[Applied Probability Trust]] | jstor = 4141346}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the ruin function here is equivalent to the tail function of the stationary distribution of waiting time in an [[M/G/1 queue]]&lt;ref name="rolski"&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Tomasz | last1 = Rolski| first2 = Hanspeter | last2= Schmidli| first3 = Volker | last3 = Schmidt| first4 = Jozef | last4 = Teugels| doi = 10.1002/9780470317044.ch5 | chapter = Risk Processes | title = Stochastic Processes for Insurance &amp; Finance | series = Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics | pages = 147–204 | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780470317044 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F^{\ast n}_l(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the transform of the tail distribution of ''F'',
:&lt;math&gt;F_l(x) = \frac{1}{\mu} \int_0^x \left(1-F(u)\right) \text{d}u.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = \frac{\lambda \mu}{c}e^{-\left( \frac{1}{\mu}-\frac{\lambda}{c}\right)x}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Sparre Andersen model==
E. Sparre Andersen extended the classical model in 1957&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, E. Sparre. "On the collective theory of risk in case of contagion between claims." ''Transactions of the XVth International Congress of Actuaries''. Vol. 2. No. 6. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; by allowing claim inter-arrival times to have arbitrary distribution functions.&lt;ref&gt;Thorin, Olof. "[http://casact.net/library/astin/vol8no1/104.pdf Some comments on the Sparre Andersen model in the risk theory]" ''The ASTIN bulletin: international journal for actuarial studies in non-life insurance and risk theory'' (1974): 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;X_t = x + ct - \sum_{i=1}^{N_t} \xi_i \quad \text{ for }t \geq 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where the claim number process &lt;math&gt; (N_t)_{t\geq 0} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[renewal process]] and &lt;math&gt;(\xi_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; are independent and identically distributed random variables. 
The model furthermore assumes that &lt;math&gt; \xi_i &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; almost surely and that &lt;math&gt; (N_t)_{t\geq 0} &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;(\xi_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; are independent . The model is also known as the renewal risk model.

==Expected discounted penalty function==

W. | doi = 10.1080/10920277.1998.10595671 | title = On the Time Value of Ruin | journal = North American Actuarial Journal | volume = 2 | pages = 48 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the behavior of the insurer's surplus through the '''expected discounted penalty function''', which is commonly referred to as Gerber-Shiu function in the ruin literature. It is arguable whether the function should have been called Powers-Gerber-Shiu function due to the contribution of Powers.&lt;ref name="powers" /&gt;

In [[Michael R. Powers|Powers]]’ notation, this is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;m(x)=\mathbb{E}^x[e^{-\delta\tau}K_{\tau}]&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the discounting force of interest, &lt;math&gt;K_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; is a general penalty function reflecting the economic costs to the insurer at the time of ruin, and the expectation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^x&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^x&lt;/math&gt;.  The function is called expected discounted cost of insolvency in Powers.&lt;ref name="powers" /&gt;

In Gerber and Shiu’s notation, it is given as

:&lt;math&gt;m(x)=\mathbb{E}^x[e^{-\delta\tau}w(X_{\tau-},X_{\tau})\mathbb{I}(\tau&lt;\infty)]&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the discounting force of interest and &lt;math&gt;w(X_{\tau-},X_{\tau})&lt;/math&gt; is a penalty function capturing the economic costs to the insurer at the time of ruin (assumed to depend on the surplus prior to ruin &lt;math&gt;X_{\tau-}&lt;/math&gt; and the deficit at ruin &lt;math&gt;X_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;), and the expectation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^x&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^x&lt;/math&gt;.  Here the indicator function &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}(\tau&lt;\infty)&lt;/math&gt; emphasizes that the penalty is exercised only when ruin occurs.

It is quite intuitive to interpret the expected discounted penalty function. Since the function measures the actuarial present value of the penalty that occurs at &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the penalty function is multiplied by the discounting factor &lt;math&gt;e^{-\delta\tau}&lt;/math&gt;, and then averaged over the probability distribution of the waiting time to &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. While Gerber and Shiu&lt;ref name="gerber-shiu" /&gt; applied this function to the classical compound-Poisson model, Powers&lt;ref name="powers" /&gt; argued that an insurer’s surplus is better modeled by a family of diffusion processes.

There are a great variety of ruin-related quantities that fall into the category of the expected discounted penalty function.

Other finance-related quantities belonging to the class of the expected discounted penalty function include the perpetual American put option,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gerber | first1= H.U. |last2= Shiu |first2= E.S.W. | year=1997 | title= From ruin theory to option pricing | journal = AFIR Colloquium, Cairns, Australia 1997| url = http://www.actuaries.org/AFIR/Colloquia/Cairns/Gerber_Shiu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the contingent claim at optimal exercise time, and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5218">In [[mathematics]], a [[polynomial]] ''P''(''X'') over a given [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is '''separable''' if its roots are [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] in an [[algebraic closure]] of ''K'', that is, the number of distinct roots is equal to the degree of the polynomial. &lt;ref&gt;S. Lang, Algebra, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept is closely related to [[square-free polynomial]]. If ''K'' is a [[perfect field]] then the two concepts coincide. In general, ''P''(''X'') is separable if and only if it is [[square-free polynomial|square-free]] over any field that contains ''K'',
which holds if and only if ''P''(''X'') is [[coprime]] to its [[formal derivative]] ''D P''(''X'').

==Older definition==
In an older definition, ''P''(''X'') was considered separable if each of its irreducible factors in K[X] is separable in the modern definition.&lt;ref&gt;N. Jacobson, Basic Algebra I, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, separability depended on the field ''K'', for example, any polynomial over a [[perfect field]] would have been considered separable. This definition, although it can be convenient for Galois theory, is no longer in use.

==Separable field extensions==
Separable polynomials are used to define [[separable extension]]s: A field extension {{math|''K'' ⊂ ''L''}} is a separable extension if and only if for every {{math|''α'' ∈ ''L''}}, which is algebraic over {{mvar|K}}, the [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] of  {{math|''α''}} over {{mvar|K}} is a separable polynomial.

[[Inseparable extension]]s (that is extensions which are not separable) may occur only in [[characteristic p|characteristic {{mvar|p}}]]. 

The criterion above leads to the quick conclusion that if ''P'' is irreducible and not separable, then ''D P''(''X'')=0.
Thus we must have
:''P''(''X'') = ''Q''(X&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;) 
for some polynomial ''Q'' over ''K'', where the prime number ''p'' is the characteristic.

With this clue we can construct an example:
:''P''(''X'') = ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''T'' 
with ''K'' the field of [[rational function]]s in the indeterminate ''T'' over the finite field with ''p'' elements. Here one can prove directly that ''P''(''X'') is irreducible, and not separable. This is actually a typical example of why ''inseparability'' matters; in geometric terms ''P'' represents the mapping on the [[projective line]] over the finite field, taking co-ordinates to their ''p''th power. Such mappings are fundamental to the [[algebraic geometry]] of finite fields. Put another way, there are coverings in that setting that cannot be 'seen' by Galois theory. (See [[radical morphism]] for a higher-level discussion.)

If ''L'' is the field extension 

:''K''(''T''&lt;sup&gt;1/''p''&lt;/sup&gt;), 

in other words the [[splitting field]] of ''P'', then ''L''/''K'' is an example of a [[purely inseparable field extension]]. It is of degree ''p'', but has no [[automorphism]] fixing ''K'', other than the identity, because ''T''&lt;sup&gt;1/''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is the unique root of ''P''. This shows directly that Galois theory must here break down. A field such that there are no such extensions is called ''perfect''. That finite fields are perfect follows ''a posteriori'' from their known structure.

One can show that the [[tensor product of fields]] of ''L'' with itself over ''K'' for this example has [[nilpotent]] elements that are non-zero. This is another manifestation of inseparability: that is, the tensor product operation on fields need not produce a ring that is a product of fields (so, not a commutative [[semisimple ring]]).

If ''P''(''x'') is separable, and its roots form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (a subgroup of the field ''K''), then ''P''(''x'') is an [[additive polynomial]].

==Applications in Galois theory==
Separable polynomials occur frequently in [[Galois theory]].

For example, let ''P'' be an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients and ''p'' be a prime number which does not divide the leading coefficient of ''P''. Let ''Q'' be the polynomial over the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements, which is obtained by reducing [[modulo (jargon)|modulo]] ''p'' the coefficients of ''P''. Then, if ''Q'' is separable (which is the case for every ''p'' but a finite number) then the degrees of the irreducible factors of ''Q'' are the lengths of the [[cyclic permutation|cycles]] of some [[permutation]] of the [[Galois group]] of ''P''. 

Another example: ''P'' being as above, a '''resolvent''' ''R'' for a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is a  polynomial whose coefficients are polynomials in the coefficients of ''P'', which provides some information on the [[Galois group]] of ''P''. More precisely, if ''R'' is separable and has a rational root then the [[Galois group]] of ''P'' is contained in ''G''. For example, if ''D'' is the [[discriminant]] of ''P'' then &lt;math&gt;X^2-D&lt;/math&gt; is a resolvent for the [[alternating group]]. This resolvent is always separable (assuming the characteristic is not 2) if ''P'' is irreducible, but most resolvents are not always separable.

[[Image:SkewedDistribution.png|thumb|200px|Example distribution with non-zero (positive) skewness. These data are from experiments on wheat grass growth.]]

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], '''skewness''' is a measure of the asymmetry of the [[probability distribution]] of a [[real number|real]]-valued [[random variable]] about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or undefined.

For a [[unimodal]] distribution, negative skew commonly indicates that the ''tail'' is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right. In cases where one tail is long but the other tail is fat, skewness does not obey a simple rule. For example, a zero value means that the tails on both sides of the mean balance out overall; this is the case for a symmetric distribution, but can also be true for an asymmetric distribution where one tail is long and thin, and the other is short but fat. 

Some popular intuitions about skewness are not correct. As a 2005 journal article points out&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=von Hippel |first1=Paul |date=2005 |title=Mean, Median, and Skew: Correcting a Textbook Rule |url=https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v13n2/vonhippel.html |journal=Journal of Statistics Education |volume=13 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many textbooks teach a rule of thumb stating that the mean is right of the median under right skew, and left of the median under left skew. This rule fails with surprising frequency. It can fail in multimodal distributions, or in distributions where one tail is long but the other is heavy. Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Introduction==
Consider the two distributions in the figure just below. Within each graph, the values on the right side of the distribution taper differently from the values on the left side. These tapering sides are called ''tails'', and they provide a visual means to determine which of the two kinds of skewness a distribution has:

#''{{visible anchor|negative skew}}'': The left tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right of the figure. The distribution is said to be ''left-skewed'', ''left-tailed'',  or ''skewed to the left'', despite the fact that the curve itself appears to be skewed or leaning to the right; ''left'' instead refers to the left tail being drawn out and, often, the mean being skewed to the left of a typical center of the data. A left-skewed distribution usually appears as a ''right-leaning'' curve.&lt;ref name="cnx.org"&gt;Susan Dean, Barbara Illowsky [http://cnx.org/content/m17104/latest/ "Descriptive Statistics: Skewness and the Mean, Median, and Mode"], Connexions website&lt;/ref&gt;
#''{{visible anchor|positive skew}}'': The right tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left of the figure. The distribution is said to be ''right-skewed'', ''right-tailed'', or ''skewed to the right'', ''despite'' the fact that the curve itself appears to be skewed or leaning to the left; ''right'' instead refers to the right tail being drawn out and, often, the mean being skewed to the right of a typical center of the data. A right-skewed distribution usually appears as a ''left-leaning'' curve.&lt;ref name="cnx.org"/&gt;

[[Image:Negative and positive skew diagrams (English).svg]]

Skewness in a data series may sometimes be observed not only graphically but by simple inspection of the values. For instance, consider the numeric sequence (49, 50, 51), whose values are evenly distributed around a central value of 50. We can transform this sequence into a negatively skewed distribution by adding a value far below the mean, e.g. (40, 49, 50, 51). Similarly, we can make the sequence positively skewed by adding a value far above the mean, e.g. (49, 50, 51, 60).

==Relationship of mean and median==
The skewness is not directly related to the relationship between the mean and median: a distribution with negative skew can have its mean greater than or less than the median, and likewise for positive skew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v13n2/vonhippel.html|title=Mean, Median, and Skew: Correcting a Textbook Rule|first=Paul T.|last=von Hippel|journal=Journal of Statistics Education| volume=13| issue=2| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the older notion of [[nonparametric skew]], defined as &lt;math&gt;(\mu - \nu)/\sigma,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean]], &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[median]], and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard deviation]], the skewness is defined in terms of this relationship: positive/right nonparametric skew means the mean is greater than (to the right of) the median, while negative/left nonparametric skew means the mean is less than (to the left of) the median. However, the modern definition of skewness and the traditional nonparametric definition do not in general have the same sign: while they agree for some families of distributions, they differ in general, and conflating them is misleading.

If the distribution is [[Symmetric probability distribution|symmetric]], then the mean is equal to the median, and the distribution has zero skewness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1.3.5.11. Measures of Skewness and Kurtosis |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35b.htm|publisher=NIST|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the distribution is both symmetric and [[Unimodal distribution|unimodal]], then the [[mean]] = [[median]] = [[Mode (statistics)|mode]]. This is the case of a coin toss or the series 1,2,3,4,... Note, however, that the converse is not true in general, i.e. zero skewness does not imply that the mean is equal to the median.

A 2005 journal article points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v13n2/vonhippel.html|title=Mean, Median, and Skew: Correcting a Textbook Rule|first=Paul T.|last=von Hippel|journal=Journal of Statistics Education| volume=13| issue=2| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many textbooks, teach a rule of thumb stating that the mean is right of the median under right skew, and left of the median under left skew. This rule fails with surprising frequency. It can fail in [[multimodal distribution]]s, or in distributions where one tail is [[Long tail|long]] but the other is [[Heavy-tailed distribution|heavy]]. Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal. Such distributions not only contradict the textbook relationship between mean, median, and skew, they also contradict the textbook interpretation of the median.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definition==

===Pearson's moment coefficient of skewness===
The skewness of a random variable ''X'' is the third [[standardized moment]] ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, defined as:&lt;ref name="StanBrown1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FXSolver1"/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;
    \gamma_1 = \operatorname{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^3 \right]
             = \frac{\mu_3}{\sigma^3}
             = \frac{\operatorname{E}\left[(X-\mu)^3\right]}{\ \ \ ( \operatorname{E}\left[ (X-\mu)^2 \right] )^{3/2}}
             = \frac{\kappa_3}{\kappa_2^{3/2}}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where ''μ'' is the mean, ''σ'' is the [[standard deviation]], E is the [[expected value|expectation operator]], ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the third [[central moment]], and ''κ''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are the t&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[cumulant]]s. It is sometimes referred to as '''Pearson's moment coefficient of skewness''',&lt;ref name="FXSolver1"&gt;[http://www.fxsolver.com/browse/formulas/Pearson's+moment+coefficient+of+skewness Pearson's moment coefficient of skewness], FXSolver.com&lt;/ref&gt; or simply the '''moment coefficient of skewness''',&lt;ref name="StanBrown1"&gt;[http://brownmath.com/stat/shape.htm "Measures of Shape: Skewness and Kurtosis"], 2008–2016 by Stan Brown, Oak Road Systems&lt;/ref&gt; but should not be confused with Pearson's other skewness statistics (see below). The last equality expresses skewness in terms of the ratio of the third cumulant ''κ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to the 1.5th power of the second cumulant ''κ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is analogous to the definition of [[kurtosis]] as the fourth cumulant normalized by the square of the second cumulant. 
The skewness is also sometimes denoted Skew[''X''].

Skewness can be expressed in terms of the non-central moment E[''X''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;] by expanding the previous formula,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    \gamma_1
     &amp;= \operatorname{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^3 \right] \\
     &amp;= \frac{\operatorname{E}[X^3] - 3\mu\operatorname E[X^2] + 3\mu^2\operatorname E[X] - \mu^3}{\sigma^3}\\
     &amp;= \frac{\operatorname{E}[X^3] - 3\mu(\operatorname E[X^2] -\mu\operatorname E[X]) - \mu^3}{\sigma^3}\\
     &amp;= \frac{\operatorname{E}[X^3] - 3\mu\sigma^2 - \mu^3}{\sigma^3}.
\end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- EDITORS BEWARE: DO NOT CHANGE THIS INTO   E[X^3] - 3\mu E[X^2] + 2\mu^3  /// SEE TALK PAGE --&gt;

===Examples===
Skewness can be infinite, as when
:&lt;math&gt;\Pr \left[ X &gt; x \right]=x^{-2}\mbox{ for }x&gt;1,\ \Pr[X&lt;1]=0&lt;/math&gt;
where the third cumulants are infinite, or as when
:&lt;math&gt;\Pr[X&lt;x]=(1-x)^{-3}/2\mbox{ for negative }x\mbox{ and }\Pr[X&gt;x]=(1+x)^{-3}/2\mbox{ for positive }x.&lt;/math&gt;
where the third cumulant is undefined.

===Properties===
Starting from a standard cumulant expansion around a normal distribution, one can show that

: &lt;span style="font-size:125%;"&gt;skewness = {{sfrac|6 ([[mean]] − [[median]])|[[standard deviation]] (1 + {{sfrac|kurtosis|8}})}} + [[Big O notation|''O'']]&amp;thinsp;(skewness&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

If ''Y'' is the sum of ''n'' [[independent and identically distributed random variables]], all with the distribution of ''X'', then the third cumulant of ''Y'' is ''n'' times that of ''X'' and the second cumulant of ''Y'' is ''n'' times that of ''X'', so &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Skew}[Y] = \mbox{Skew}[X]/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This shows that the skewness of the sum is smaller, as it approaches a Gaussian distribution in accordance with the [[central limit theorem]].  Note that the assumption that the variables be independent for the above formula is very important because it is possible even for the sum of two Gaussian variables to have a skewed distribution (see [[coskewness#Example|this example]]).

===Sample skewness===
For a sample of ''n'' values, a natural [[Method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]] estimator of the population skewness is&lt;ref name=JG&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joanes&lt;!--sic--&gt; |first=D. N. |last2=Gill |first2=C. A. |year=1998 |title=Comparing measures of sample skewness and kurtosis |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series D]] |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=183–189 |doi=10.1111/1467-9884.00122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
    b_1 = \frac{m_3}{s^3}
        = \frac{\tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^3}{ \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^2}^{\,3}}
        = \frac{\tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^3}{\left[\tfrac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^2\right]^{3/2}}\ ,
  &lt;/math&gt;

        
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[sample mean]], ''s'' is the [[Standard deviation#Corrected sample standard deviation|sample standard deviation]], and the numerator ''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the sample third central [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]].

Another common definition of the ''sample skewness'' is&lt;ref name=JG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doane, David P., and Lori E. Seward. [http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n2/doane.pdf "Measuring skewness: a forgotten statistic."] Journal of Statistics Education 19.2 (2011): 1-18. (Page 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
G_1 &amp; = \frac{k_3}{k_2^{3/2}} = \frac{n^2}{(n-1)(n-2)}\; \frac{m_3}{s^3} \\
&amp; = \frac{\sqrt{n\left( n-1 \right)}}{n-2}\frac{{{m}_{3}}}{{{m}_{2}}^{\frac{3}{2}}} =  \frac{\sqrt{n\left( n-1 \right)}}{n-2}\left[ \frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{{{\left( {{x}_{i}}-\bar{x} \right)}^{3}}}}{{{\left( \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{{{\left( {{x}_{i}}-\bar{x} \right)}^{2}}} \right)}^{\frac{3}{2}}}} \right], \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;




where &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt; is the unique symmetric unbiased estimator of the third [[cumulant]] and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = s^2&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric unbiased estimator of the second cumulant (i.e. the variance).

In general, the ratios &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; are both [[Bias of an estimator|biased estimators]] of the population skewness &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt;; their expected values can even have the opposite sign from the true skewness. (For instance, a mixed distribution consisting of very thin Gaussians centred at −99, 0.5, and 2 with weights 0.01, 0.66, and 0.33 has a skewness of about −9.77, but in a sample of 3, &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; has an expected value of about 0.32, since usually all three samples are in the positive-valued part of the distribution, which is skewed the other way.) Nevertheless, &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; each have obviously the correct expected value of zero for any symmetric distribution with a finite third moment, including a [[normal distribution]].

Under the assumption that the underlying random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is normally distributed, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n} b_1 \xrightarrow{d} N(0, 6)&lt;/math&gt;. The variance of the skewness of a random sample of size ''n'' from a normal distribution is&lt;ref name=Duncan1997&gt;Duncan Cramer (1997) Fundamental Statistics for Social Research. Routledge. {{isbn|9780415172042}} (p 85)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, M.G.; Stuart, A. (1969) ''The Advanced Theory of Statistics, Volume 1: Distribution Theory, 3rd Edition'', Griffin. {{isbn|0-85264-141-9}} (Ex 12.9)&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}(G_1)= \frac{6n ( n - 1 )}{ ( n - 2 )( n + 1 )( n + 3 ) } .&lt;/math&gt;

An approximate alternative is 6/''n'', but this is inaccurate for small samples.

In normal samples, &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; has the smaller variance of the two estimators, with

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}(b_1) &lt; \operatorname{var} \left( \frac{m_3}{m_2^{3/2}} \right) &lt; \operatorname{var}(G_1), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the denominator is the (biased) sample second central moment.&lt;ref name=JG/&gt;

The adjusted Fisher–Pearson standardized moment coefficient &lt;math&gt; G_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the version found in [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and several statistical packages including [[Minitab]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]] and [[SPSS]].&lt;ref name=Doane2011&gt;Doane DP, Seward LE (2011) J Stat Educ 19 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Skewness is a descriptive statistic that can be used on conjunction with the [[histogram]] and the normal [[quantile plot]] to characterize the data or distribution.

Skewness indicates which direction and a relative magnitude of how far a distribution deviates from normal. 

With pronounced skewness, standard statistical inference procedures such as a [[confidence interval]] for a mean will be not only incorrect, in the sense of having true coverage level unequal to the nominal (e.g., 95%) level, but also with unequal error probabilities on each side.

Skewness can be used to obtain approximate probabilities and quantiles of distributions (such as the [[value at risk]] in finance) via the [[Cornish-Fisher expansion]]. 

Many models assume normal distribution; i.e., data are symmetric about the mean. The normal distribution has a skewness of zero. But in reality, data points may not be perfectly symmetric. So, an understanding of the skewness of the dataset indicates whether deviations from the mean are going to be positive or negative.

[[D'Agostino's K-squared test]] is a [[goodness-of-fit]] [[normality test]] based on sample skewness and sample kurtosis.

==Other measures of skewness==
[[Image:Comparison mean median mode.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of [[mean]], [[median]] and [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of two [[log-normal distribution]]s with different skewnesses.]]

Other measures of skewness have been used, including simpler calculations suggested by [[Karl Pearson]]&lt;ref name="Capistrano1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.upd.edu.ph/s114%20cnotes%20fcapistrano/Chapter%2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705025706/http://www.stat.upd.edu.ph/s114%20cnotes%20fcapistrano/Chapter%2010.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with Pearson's moment coefficient of skewness, see above). These other measures are:

===Pearson's first skewness coefficient (mode skewness)=== 
The Pearson mode skewness,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Pearson Mode Skewness|urlname=PearsonModeSkewness}}&lt;/ref&gt; or first skewness coefficient, is defined as

: &lt;span style="font-size:125%;"&gt;{{sfrac|[[mean]] − [[Mode (statistics)|mode]]|[[standard deviation]]}}&lt;/span&gt;.

===Pearson's second skewness coefficient (median skewness)=== 
The Pearson median skewness, or second skewness coefficient,&lt;ref name="MWPSK"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Pearson's skewness coefficients|urlname=PearsonsSkewnessCoefficients}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amstat2011"&gt;Doane, David P., and Lori E. Seward. "[http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n2/doane.pdf Measuring Skewness: A Forgotten Statistic?]" Journal of Statistics Education 19.2 (2011): 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as

: &lt;span style="font-size:125%;"&gt;{{sfrac|3 ([[mean]] − [[median]])|[[standard deviation]]}}&lt;/span&gt;.

The latter is a simple multiple of the [[nonparametric skew]].

===Quartile-based measures===

Bowley's measure of skewness (from 1901),&lt;ref&gt;Bowley, A. L. (1901). Elements of Statistics, P.S. King &amp; Son, Laondon.  Or in a later edition: BOWLEY, AL. "Elements of Statistics, 4th Edn (New York, Charles Scribner)."(1920).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kenney1962&gt;Kenney JF and Keeping ES (1962) ''Mathematics of Statistics, Pt. 1, 3rd ed.'', Van Nostrand, (page 102).&lt;/ref&gt; also called Yule's coefficient (from 1912)&lt;ref&gt;Yule, George Udny. An introduction to the theory of statistics. C. Griffin, limited, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Groeneveld, Richard A. "An influence function approach to describing the skewness of a distribution." The American Statistician 45.2 (1991): 97-102.&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as: 
:&lt;math&gt;B_1 = \frac{{{Q}_{3}}+{{Q}_{1}}-2{{Q}_{2}}}{{{Q}_{3}}-{{Q}_{1}}}&lt;/math&gt;.
When writing it as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{{{Q}_{3}}+{{Q}_{1}}}{2}-{{Q}_{2}}}{\frac{{{Q}_{3}}-{{Q}_{1}}}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, it is easier to see that the numerator is the average of the upper and lower quartiles (a measure of location) minus the median while the denominator is (Q3-Q1)/2 which (for symmetric distributions) is the [[Average absolute deviation|MAD]] measure of [[statistical dispersion|dispersion]].

Other names for this measure are Galton's measure of skewness,&lt;ref name=Johnson1994&gt;Johnson ''et al'' (1994) p 3, p 40&lt;/ref&gt; the Yule–Kendall index&lt;ref name=Wilks1995&gt;Wilks DS (1995) ''Statistical Methods in the Atmospheric Sciences'', p 27. Academic Press. {{isbn|0-12-751965-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the quartile skewness {{citation needed|date=February 2016}},

A more general formulation of a skewness function was described by Groeneveld, R. A. and Meeden, G. (1984):&lt;ref name=Groeneveld1984&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2987742 | last1 = Groeneveld | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Meeden | first2 = G. | year = 1984 | title = Measuring Skewness and Kurtosis | jstor = 2987742| journal = The Statistician | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 391–399 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacGillivray1992&gt;MacGillivray (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hinkley1975&gt;Hinkley DV (1975) "On power transformations to symmetry", ''[[Biometrika]], 62, 101–111&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma( u )= \frac{ F^{ -1 }( u ) +F^{ -1 }( 1 - u )-2F^{ -1 }( 1 / 2 ) }{F^{ -1 }( u ) -F^{ -1 }( 1 - u ) } &lt;/math&gt;
where ''F'' is the [[cumulative distribution function]]. This leads to a corresponding overall measure of skewness&lt;ref name=MacGillivray1992&gt;MacGillivray (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; defined as the [[supremum]] of this over the range 1/2&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''u''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. Another measure can be obtained by integrating the numerator and denominator of this expression.&lt;ref name=Groeneveld1984/&gt; The function ''γ''(''u'') satisfies −1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''γ''(''u'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 and is well defined without requiring the existence of any moments of the distribution.&lt;ref name=Groeneveld1984/&gt;

Bowley's measure of skewness is γ(''u'') evaluated at ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3/4. Kelley's measure of skewness uses ''u'' = 0.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ruh.ac.lk/~pubudu/app5.pdf |title=Applied Statistics I: Chapter 5: Measures of skewness |author=A.W.L. Pubudu Thilan |website=University of Ruhuna |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groeneveld &amp; Meeden’s coefficient===

Groeneveld &amp; Meeden have suggested, as an alternative measure of skewness,&lt;ref name=Groeneveld1984 /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; B_3 = \mathrm{skew}(X) = \frac{( \mu - \nu ) }{ E( | X - \nu | ) }, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ'' is the mean, ''ν'' is the median, |…| is the [[absolute value]], and ''E''() is the expectation operator. This is closely related in form to [[Skewness#Pearson.27s second skewness coefficient .28median skewness.29|Pearson's second skewness coefficient]].

===L-moments===

Use of [[L-moment]]s in place of moments provides a measure of skewness known as the L-skewness.&lt;ref name=hos:92&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hosking | first= J.R.M. | year=1992 | title=Moments or L moments? An example comparing two measures of distributional shape | journal=The American Statistician | volume=46 | number=3 | pages=186–189 | jstor=2685210 | doi=10.2307/2685210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distance skewness===

A value of skewness equal to zero does not imply that the probability distribution is symmetric. Thus there is a need for another measure of asymmetry that has this property: such a measure was introduced in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Szekely, G.J. (2000).  "Pre-limit and post-limit theorems for statistics", In: ''Statistics for the 21st Century'' (eds. [[C. R. Rao]] and G. J. Szekely), Dekker, New York, pp. 411–422.&lt;/ref&gt; It is called '''distance skewness''' and denoted by dSkew. If ''X'' is a random variable taking values in the ''d''-dimensional Euclidean space, ''X'' has finite expectation, ''X''{{'}} is an independent identically distributed copy of ''X'', and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the norm in the Euclidean space, then a simple ''measure of asymmetry'' with respect to location parameter θ is
: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{dSkew}(X) := 1 - \frac{\operatorname{E}\|X-X'\|}{\operatorname{E}\|X+X'-2 \theta\|} \text{ if } \Pr(X=\theta)\ne 1
&lt;/math&gt;
and dSkew(''X'')&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;0 for ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;θ (with probability 1). Distance skewness is always between 0 and 1, equals 0 if and only if ''X'' is diagonally symmetric with respect to θ (''X'' and θ −''X'' have the same probability distribution) and equals 1 if and only if  X is a constant ''c'' (&lt;math&gt;c \neq \theta&lt;/math&gt;) with probability one.&lt;ref&gt;Szekely,&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;J. and Mori,&amp;nbsp;T.&amp;nbsp;F. (2001) "A characteristic measure of asymmetry and its application for testing diagonal symmetry", ''Communications in Statistics – Theory and Methods'' 30/8&amp;9, 1633–1639.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is a simple consistent [[statistical test]] of diagonal symmetry based on the '''sample distance skewness''':
: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{dSkew}_n(X):= 1 - \frac{\sum_{i,j} \|x_i-x_j\| }{\sum_{i,j} \|x_i+x_j-2\theta \|}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Medcouple===

The [[medcouple]] is a scale-invariant robust measure of skewness, with a [[breakdown point]] of 25%.&lt;ref name="Brys2004"&gt;{{cite journal

: &lt;math&gt; h(x_i, x_j) = \frac{ (x_i - x_m) - (x_m - x_j)}{x_i - x_j} &lt;/math&gt;
taken over all couples &lt;math&gt;(x_i, x_j)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i \geq x_m \geq x_j&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_m&lt;/math&gt; is the median of the [[sample (statistics)|sample]] &lt;math&gt;\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen as the median of all possible quantile skewness measures.

'''Skolem arithmetic''' is the [[first-order predicate calculus|first-order theory]] of the [[natural number]]s with [[multiplication]], named in honor of [[Thoralf Skolem]]. The [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] of Skolem arithmetic contains only the multiplication operation and equality, omitting the addition operation entirely.

Skolem arithmetic is much weaker than [[Peano arithmetic]], which includes both addition and multiplication operations. Unlike Peano arithmetic, Skolem arithmetic is a [[Decidability (logic)|decidable theory]]. This means it is possible to effectively determine, for any sentence in the language of Skolem arithmetic, whether that sentence is provable from the axioms of Skolem arithmetic. The asymptotic running-time [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of this [[decision problem]] is triply exponential, however.

==Extension==
Skolem arithmetic with the order predicate or the successor predicate is equivalent to [[Peano arithmetic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2649">In [[probability theory]], the '''Skorokhod problem''' is the problem of solving a [[stochastic differential equation]] with a reflecting boundary condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lions | first1 = P.

'''Spiking neural networks''' ('''SNNs''') are [[artificial neural network]] models that more closely mimic natural neural networks.&lt;ref name="Maas 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maass|first1=Wolfgang|title=Networks of spiking neurons: The third generation of neural network models|journal=Neural Networks|volume=10|issue=9|year=1997|pages=1659–1671|issn=0893-6080|doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(97)00011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Artificial neuron|neuronal]] and [[Electrical synapse|synaptic]] state, SNNs also incorporate the concept of time into their [[Operating Model|operating model]]. The idea is that [[Artificial neuron|neurons]] in the SNN do not fire at each propagation cycle (as it happens with typical multi-layer [[perceptron|perceptron networks]]), but rather fire only when a [[membrane potential]]&amp;nbsp;– an intrinsic quality of the neuron related to its membrane electrical charge&amp;nbsp;– reaches a specific value. When a neuron fires, it generates a signal which travels to other neurons which, in turn, increase or decrease their potentials in accordance with this signal.

In the context of spiking neural networks, the current activation level (modeled as some [[differential equation]]) is normally considered to be the neuron's state, with incoming spikes pushing this value higher, and then either firing or decaying over time. Various ''coding methods'' exist for interpreting the outgoing ''[[spike train]]'' as a real-value number, either relying on the frequency of  spikes, or the timing between spikes, to encode information.

==Beginnings==

The first [[scientific model]] of a spiking neuron was proposed by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] in 1952. This model describes how [[action potential]]s are initiated and propagated. Spikes, however, are not generally transmitted directly between [[neuron]]s. Communication requires the exchange of chemical substances in the [[synapse|synaptic]] gap, called [[neurotransmitter]]s. The complexity and variability of biological models have resulted in various neuron models, such as the [[integrate-and-fire]] (1907?), [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]] (1961–1962) and [[Hindmarsh–Rose model]] (1984).

From the [[information theory]] point of view, the problem is to propose a model that explains how information is encoded and decoded by a series of trains of pulses, i.e. action potentials. Thus, one of the fundamental questions of neuroscience is to determine if neurons communicate by a [[Neural coding|rate or temporal code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Wulfram Gerstner | chapter = Spiking Neurons |editor1=Wolfgang Maass |editor2=Christopher M. Bishop | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-262-63221-7 | title = Pulsed Neural Networks | publisher = MIT Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jEug7sJXP2MC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22Pulsed+Neural+Networks%22+rate-code+neuroscience&amp;ei=FEo0ScetL4zukgSyldy8Ag }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Temporal coding]] suggests that a single spiking neuron ''can replace hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural  net.''&lt;ref name="Maas 1996"/&gt;

==Applications==
This kind of [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] can in principle be used for information processing applications the same way as traditional artificial neural networks.&lt;ref name="Alnajjar 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Alnajjar | first1 = F. | last2 = Murase | first2 = K. | title = A simple Aplysia-like spiking neural network to generate adaptive behavior in autonomous robots | journal = Adaptive Behavior | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 306–324 | doi =10.1177/1059712308093869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, spiking neural networks can model the [[central nervous system]] of a virtual insect for seeking food without the prior knowledge of the environment.&lt;ref name="Silvia_2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=X Zhang |author2=Z Xu |author3=C Henriquez |author4=S Ferrari | title = Spike-based indirect training of a spiking neural network-controlled virtual insect | journal = Decision and Control (CDC), IEEE | pages = 6798–6805 |date=Dec 2013 | doi = 10.1109/CDC.2013.6760966}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to their more realistic properties, they can also be used to study the operation of [[Biological neural network|biological neural circuits]]. Starting with a hypothesis about the topology of a biological neuronal circuit and its function, the [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological recordings]] of this circuit can be compared to the output of the corresponding spiking artificial neural network simulated on [[computer]], determining the plausibility of the starting hypothesis.

In practice, there is a major difference between the theoretical power of spiking neural networks and what has been demonstrated. They have proved useful in neuroscience, but not (yet) in engineering. Some large scale neural network models have been designed that take advantage of the pulse coding found in spiking neural networks, these networks mostly rely on the principles of [[reservoir computing]]. However, the real world application of large scale spiking neural networks has been limited because the increased computational costs associated with simulating realistic neural models have not been justified by commensurate benefits in computational power. As a result, there has been little application of large scale spiking neural networks to solve computational tasks of the order and complexity that are commonly addressed using rate coded (second generation) neural networks. In addition it can be difficult to adapt second generation neural network models into real time, spiking neural networks (especially if these network algorithms are defined in discrete time). It is relatively easy to construct a spiking neural network model and observe its dynamics. It is much harder to develop a model with stable behavior that computes a specific function.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Software==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}
There is diverse range of [[application software]] to simulate spiking neural networks. This software can be classified according to the use of the simulation:
* Software used primarily to simulate spiking neural networks which are present in the biology to study their operation and characteristics. In this group we can find simulators such as [[GENESIS (software)|GENESIS]] (the GEneral NEural SImulation System) developed in James Bower's laboratory at [[Caltech]]; [[Neuron (software)|NEURON]], mainly developed by Michael Hines, John W. Moore and Ted Carnevale in [[Yale University]] and [[Duke University]]; [[Brian (software)|Brian]], developed by Romain Brette and Dan Goodman at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]; and [[NEST (software)|NEST]] developed by the NEST Initiative. This type of [[application software]] usually supports the simulation of complex neural models with a high level of detail and accuracy. However large networks usually require very time-consuming [[Computer simulation|simulations]].
* Software which addresses information processing tasks to solve problems.  Commercialized processing software such as BrainChip Studio are in this group.  It is based on application software developed by [[Arnaud Delorme|Delorme]] and Thorpe in collaboration between Centre de Recherche Cerveau et Cognition and BrainChip (formally SpikeNet technology).  The supervised learning software has an ability to be trained instantaneously, high accuracy, very low power and has considerable advantages over convolutional neural networks where massive datasets are not available.  It's currently in commercial use in both civil and commercial surveillance applications in Europe and North America. 
* Software which provides capabilities to support the simulation of relatively complex neural models efficiently so that it can also be convenient for information processing tasks. This software can exploit biological neuron characteristics to perform computation functions and at the same time allows the study of the functionality of these neural characteristics. In this software group we can find [[EDLUT]] which has been developed in the [[University of Granada]]. This application software must be efficient enough to run fast simulations, sometimes even in real time, and at the same time it must support neural models which are detailed and biologically plausible.

==Hardware==
[[Neurogrid]], built at Stanford University, is a board that can simulate spiking neural networks directly in hardware. [[SpiNNaker]]  (Spiking Neural Network Architecture), designed at the [[University of Manchester]], uses [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processors as the building blocks of a [[massively parallel computing|massively parallel]] computing platform based on  a six-layer [[Thalamocortical radiations|thalamocortical]] model.&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Xin Jin| last2 = Furber | first2 = S. B.| authorlink2 = Steve Furber| last3 = Woods | first3 = J. V.| doi = 10.1109/IJCNN.2008.4634194| chapter = Efficient modelling of spiking neural networks on a scalable chip multiprocessor| title = 2008 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence)| pages = 2812–2819| year = 2008| isbn = 978-1-4244-1820-6| pmid =  | pmc = | postscript = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another implementation is the [[TrueNorth]] processor from IBM. This processor contains 5.4 billion transistors, but is designed to consume very little power, only 70 [[milliwatt]]s; most processors in personal computers contain about 1.4 billion transistors and require 35 watts or more. IBM refers to the design principle behind TrueNorth as [[neuromorphic computing]]. Its primary purpose is pattern recognition;  while critics say the chip isn't powerful enough, its supporters point out that this is only the first generation, and the capabilities of improved iterations will become clear.&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, John, A new chip functions like a brain, IBM says, New York Times, August 8, 2014, p.B1&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial implementation of a hardware-accelerated spiking neural network system, was introduced by BrainChip in September 2017.   BrainChip Accelerator is an 8-lane, PCI-Express add-in card that increases the speed and accuracy of the object recognition function of BrainChip Studio software (see above) by up to six times.   The processing is done by six BrainChip Accelerator cores in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Each core performs fast, user-defined image scaling, spike generation, and spiking neural network comparison to recognize objects.  In combination with a CPU , BrainChip Accelerator can process 16 channels of video simultaneously, with an effective throughput of over 600 frames per second.    The low-power characteristics of BrainChip’s spiking neural technology results in only 15 watts total consumption.  It's particularly suited to aiding law enforcement and intelligence organizations to rapidly search vast amounts of video footage and identify patterns or faces.   The SNN technology enables the Hardware Accelerator to work on low-resolution video and requires only a 24x24 pixel image to detect and classify faces.

Another hardware platform aimed at providing reconfigurable, general-purpose, real-time neural networks of spiking neurons is the [[Dynamic Neuromorphic Asynchronous Processor]] (DYNAP). DYNAP uses a unique combination of slow, low-power, inhomogeneous sub-thresholds analog circuits, and fast programmable digital circuits. This allow the implementation of real-time spike-based neural processing architectures in which memory and computation are co-localized, solving the von Neumann bottleneck problem and enabling real-time massively multiplexed communication of spiking events for realising massive networks. Recurrent networks, feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, attractor networks, echo-state networks, deep networks, and sensory fusion networks are few of the possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Indiveri|first=G.|last2=Corradi|first2=F.|last3=Qiao|first3=N.|date=2015-12-01|title=Neuromorphic architectures for spiking deep neural networks|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7409623/|journal=2015 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM)|pages=4.2.1–4.2.4|doi=10.1109/IEDM.2015.7409623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[stochastic calculus]], '''Tanaka's formula''' states that

:&lt;math&gt;|B_t| = \int_0^t \sgn(B_s)\, dB_s + L_t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard [[Brownian motion]], sgn denotes the [[sign function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sgn (x) = \begin{cases} +1, &amp; x &gt; 0; \\0,&amp; x=0  \\-1, &amp; x &lt; 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is its [[Local time (mathematics)|local time]] at 0 (the local time spent by ''B'' at 0 before time ''t'') given by the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-limit]]

:&lt;math&gt;L_{t} = \lim_{\varepsilon \downarrow 0} \frac1{2 \varepsilon} | \{ s \in [0, t] | B_{s} \in (- \varepsilon, + \varepsilon) \} |.&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
Tanaka's formula is the explicit [[Doob&amp;ndash;Meyer decomposition theorem|Doob&amp;ndash;Meyer decomposition]] of the submartingale |''B''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;| into the [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] part (the [[integral]] on the right-hand side), and a continuous increasing process (local time).  It can also be seen as the analogue of [[Itō's lemma]] for the (nonsmooth) absolute value function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=|x|&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; f'(x) = \sgn(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f''(x) = 2\delta(x) &lt;/math&gt;; see [[Local time (mathematics)|local time]] for a formal explanation of the Itō term.

== Outline of proof ==
The [[Function (mathematics)|function]] |''x''| is not [[smooth function|''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] in ''x'' at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, so we cannot apply [[Itō's formula]] directly. But if we approximate it near zero (i.e. in [&amp;minus;''ε'',&amp;nbsp;''ε'']) by [[parabola]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{2|\varepsilon|}+\frac{|\varepsilon|}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

And using [[Itō's formula]] we can then take the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] as ''ε''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0, leading to Tanaka's formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7850">In [[geometry]], a '''unital''' is a set of ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 [[point (geometry)|points]] arranged into subsets of size ''n'' + 1 so that every pair of distinct points of the set are contained in exactly one subset. ''n'' ≥ 3 is required by some authors to avoid small exceptional cases.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, {{harvnb|Barwick|Ebert|2008|loc=p. 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is equivalent to saying that a unital is a 2-(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1, ''n'' + 1, 1) [[block design]]. Some unitals may be [[Embedding|embedded]] in a [[projective plane]] of order ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the subsets of the design become sets of [[collinear]] points in the projective plane). In this case of ''embedded unitals'', every line of the plane intersects the unital in either 1 or ''n'' + 1 points. In the [[Desarguesian plane]]s, PG(2,''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the classical examples of unitals are given by nondegenerate Hermitian curves. There are also many non-classical examples. The first and the only known unital with non prime power parameters, ''n''=''6'', was constructed by Bhaskar Bagchi and Sunanda Bagchi.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=S.|last1=Bagchi|first2=B.|last2=Bagchi|title=Designs from pairs of finite fields. A cyclic unital U(6) and other regular steiner 2-designs|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A|year=1989|volume=52|pages=51–61|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(89)90061-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is still unknown if this unital can be embedded in a projective plane of order ''36'', if such a plane exists.

==Classical unitals==
We review some terminology used in [[projective geometry]].

A '''correlation''' of a projective geometry is a [[bijection]] on its subspaces that reverses containment. In particular, a correlation interchanges [[point (geometry)|points]] and [[hyperplanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barwick|Ebert|2008|loc=p. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation of order two is called a '''polarity'''.

A polarity is called a '''unitary polarity''' if its associated [[sesquilinear form]] ''s'' with companion automorphism ''α'' satisfies:
:: ''s''(''u'',''v'') = ''s''(''v'',''u'')&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; for all vectors ''u'', ''v'' of the underlying [[vector space]].

A point is called an '''absolute point''' of a polarity if it lies on the image of itself under the polarity.

The absolute points of a unitary polarity of the projective geometry PG(''d'',''F''), for some ''d'' ≥ 2, is a '''nondegenerate Hermitian variety''', and if ''d'' = 2 this variety is called a '''nondegenerate Hermitian curve'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barwick|Ebert|2008|loc=p. 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In PG(2,''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for some prime power ''q'', the set of points of a nondegenerate Hermitian curve form a unital,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is called a ''classical unital''.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}(2,q^2)&lt;/math&gt; be a nondegenerate Hermitian curve in &lt;math&gt;PG(2,q^2)&lt;/math&gt; for some prime power &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. As all nondgenerate Hermitian curves in the same plane are projectively equivalent, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; can be described in terms of [[homogeneous coordinates]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barwick|Ebert|2008|loc=p. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = \{(x_0, x_1, x_2)\colon x_0^{q+1} + x_1^{q+1} + x_2^{q+1} = 0 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Ree unitals==
Another family of unitals, based on [[Ree group]]s was constructed by H. Lüneburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=H.|last=Lüneburg|title=Some remarks concerning the Ree group of type (G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)|journal=Journal of Algebra|year=1966|volume=3|pages=256–259|doi=10.1016/0021-8693(66)90014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let Γ = R(''q'') be the Ree group of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of order (''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'' − 1) where ''q'' = 3&lt;sup&gt;2''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt;. Let ''P'' be the set of all ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 [[Sylow theorems|Sylow 3-subgroups]] of Γ. Γ [[Group action|acts]] doubly transitively on this set by [[Conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]] (it will be convenient to think of these subgroups as ''points'' that Γ is acting on.) For any ''S'' and ''T'' in ''P'', the pointwise [[Stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]], Γ&lt;sub&gt;''S'',''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Cyclic group|cyclic]] of order ''q'' - 1, and thus contains a unique [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], μ. Each such involution fixes exactly ''q'' + 1 points of ''P''. Construct a [[block design]] on the points of ''P'' whose blocks are the fixed point sets of these various involutions μ. Since Γ acts doubly transitively on ''P'', this will be a 2-design with parameters 2-(''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1, ''q'' + 1, 1) called a Ree unital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmus|Key|1992|loc=p. 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lüneburg also showed that the Ree unitals can not be embedded in projective planes of order ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Desarguesian plane|Desarguesian]] or not) such that the automorphism group Γ is induced by a [[collineation group]] of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''q'' = 3, Grüning&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=K. |last=Grüning|title=Das Kleinste Ree-Unital|year=1986|volume=46|journal=Archiv der Mathematik|pages=473–480|doi=10.1007/bf01210788}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that a Ree unital can not be embedded in any projective plane of order 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barwick|Ebert|2008|loc=p. 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isomorphic versus equivalent unitals==
Since unitals are [[block design]]s, two unitals are said to be ''isomorphic'' if there is a design [[isomorphism]] between them, that is, a [[bijection]] between the point sets which maps blocks to blocks. This concept does not take into account the property of embeddability, so to do so we say that two unitals, embedded in the same ambient plane, are ''equivalent'' if there is a [[collineation]] of the plane which maps one unital to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barwick|Ebert|2008|loc=p. 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embeddable versus non-embeddable==
There are precisely four projective planes of order 9: the [[Desarguesian plane]] PG(2,9), the [[Hall plane]] of order 9, the dual Hall plane of order 9 and the [[Hughes plane]] of order 9.&lt;ref&gt;PG(2,9) and the Hughes plane are both self-dual.&lt;/ref&gt; An exhaustive computer search by Penttila and Royle found 18 unitals (up to equivalence) with ''n'' = 3 in these four planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=T.|last1=Penttila|first2=G.F.|last2=Royle|title=Sets of type (''m,n'') in the affine and projective planes of order nine|journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography|year=1995|volume=6|pages=229–245|doi=10.1007/bf01388477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two in PG(2,9), four in the Hall plane, and so another four in the dual Hall plane, and eight in the Hughes plane. However, one of the unitals in the Hall plane is self-dual, and so, gets counted again in the dual Hall plane. Thus, there are 17 distinct embeddable unitals with ''n'' = 3. On the other hand, a nonexhaustive computer search found over 900 mutually nonisomorphic designs which are unitals with ''n'' = 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=A.|last1=Betten|first2=D.|last2=Betten|first3=V.D.|last3=Tonchev|title=Unitals and codes|journal=Discrete Mathematics|year=2003|volume=267|pages=23–33|doi=10.1016/s0012-365x(02)00600-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1540">The '''Weierstrass–Erdmann condition''' is a technical tool from the [[calculus of variations]]. This condition gives the sufficient conditions for an [[extremal]] to have a corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=I. M. |last=Gelfand |authorlink=Israel Gelfand |first2=S. V. |last2=Fomin |authorlink2=Sergei Fomin |title=Calculus of Variations |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1963 |isbn= |pages=61–63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CeC7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions ==

The condition says that, along a [[piecewise smooth]] extremal ''x''(''t'') (i.e. an extremal which is smooth except at a finite number of corners) for an [[integral]] &lt;math&gt;J=\int f(t,x,y)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;, the [[partial derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\partial f/\partial x&lt;/math&gt; must be [[Continuous function|continuous]] at a corner&amp;nbsp;''T''. That is, if one takes the [[Limit of a function|limit]] of partials on both sides of the corner as one approaches the corner&amp;nbsp;''T'', the result must be the same answer.

== Applications ==

The condition allows one to prove that a corner exists along a given extremal. As a result, there are many applications to [[differential geometry]]. In calculations of the [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions|Weierstrass E-Function]], it is often helpful to find where corners exist along the curves. Similarly, the condition allows for one to find a minimizing curve for a given integral.
