The '''1979 Texas 400''' was a [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) race that took place on June 3, 1979, at [[Texas World Speedway]] in [[College Station, Texas]].

By [[1980 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|the following season]], NASCAR had completely stopped tracking the year model of all the vehicles and most teams did not take stock cars to the track under their own power anymore. Only manual transmission vehicles were allowed to participate in this race; a policy that NASCAR has retained to the present day.

==Summary==
Two hundred laps took place on an [[Oval track racing|oval track]] spanning {{convert|2.0|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="racingreference"/&gt; [[Darrell Waltrip]] won the race; beating [[Bobby Allison]] by 60 seconds.&lt;ref name="racingreference"/&gt; Eleven thousand and five hundred fans would attend this live race with lasted more than two hours and thirty-three minutes; making it the least attended race in NASCAR's modern era even when comparing races from after the [[2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] season.&lt;ref name="racingreference"/&gt; Waltrip's overall speed for the race was {{convert|156.216|mi/h|km/h}} while [[Buddy Baker]] achieved the pole position for the race with a speed of {{convert|167.903|mi/h|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="racingreference"/&gt; Total winnings for this race were $161,250 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|161250|1979|r=2}}}} when considering inflation); Darrell would receive $21,750 of the total purse (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|21750|1979|r=2}}}} when considering inflation).

Dale Earnhardt was Waltrip's top challenger before he crashed late in the race. Waltrip had a lap lead but Allison, Baker, and Yarborough had a one-lap dash for second. Allison got second by about two feet over Baker, who was about four feet back.&lt;ref name="racingreference"/&gt; Some of the more notable names to make an appearance here were: [[Dale Earnhardt]], [[Richard Childress]], [[Cale Yarborough]], [[Terry Labonte]], [[Richard Petty]], and [[J. D. McDuffie]].&lt;ref name="racingreference"/&gt;

Notable crew chiefs in attendance for this race were [[Buddy Parrott]], [[Joey Arrington]], [[Kirk Shelmerdine]], [[Darrell Bryant]], [[Dale Inman]], [[Bud Moore (NASCAR owner)|Bud Moore]], [[Tim Brewer]], and [[Jake Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.racing-reference.info/entrylist/1979-14/W/C| title = 1979 Texas 400 crew chiefs information | publisher = Racing Reference | accessdate = 2018-08-23|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Jim Hurlbert]] and [[John Rezek]] would make their NASCAR Cup Series debut, [[Billy Hagan (racing driver)|Billy Hagan]] would make his grand exit after this race along with three other drivers. [[Bill Meazel]] would make his only NASCAR appearance during this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.race-database.com/results/results.php?year=1979&amp;race=14&amp;series_id=2| title = Notable events at the ''1979 Texas 400'' | publisher = Race Database | accessdate = 2014-05-08|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American Iron''' is a group of North American [[road racing]] classes sanctioned by the [[National Auto Sport Association]] (NASA).

'''American Iron''' racing features domestic muscle or [[pony cars]] such as [[Ford Mustang]], [[Chevrolet Camaro]], and [[Pontiac Firebird]] in four classes, '''Camaro Mustang Challenge (CMC &amp; CMC-II),''' '''American Iron (AI),''' and '''American Iron Extreme (AIX)'''. It has large, closely contested fields of V8 powered cars. 

The different classes reflect various levels of permitted modifications, from the near showroom stock entry level Camaro Mustang Challenge (CMC) class, through to the "almost anything goes" American Iron Extreme (AIX) class at the opposite end of the scale. CMC, CMC-II, and AI classes have a power to weight limitation, while AIX is unrestricted. 

The minimum weight for an American Iron race car is 2,700 pounds with driver included. The AI class has a maximum power to weight ratio of 9.5:1 (9.5&amp;nbsp;lbs of vehicle weight per horsepower) and a maximum torque to weight ratio of 9:1 (9 pounds of vehicle weight per each foot-pound).  Both are measured at the rear wheels. These formulas are designed to allow differences in vehicle handling and power while equalizing the competition and keeping race team budgets low by penalizing excessive power.

'''American Iron''' races are run at all [http://www.nasaproracing.com/aboutnasa/regions.html NASA regional] events, as well as the annual National Championships currently held each year in September at [[Miller Motorsports Park]] in Tooele, Utah.  Previously, the championships were held at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course]].

The '''Arab–Khazar wars''' were a series of conflicts fought between the armies of the [[Khazars|Khazar]] [[Khaganate]] and the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliphate]]s and their respective vassals. Historians usually distinguish two major periods of conflict, the '''First Arab–Khazar War''' ({{circa|642–652}}) and '''Second Arab–Khazar War''' ({{circa|722–737}}),{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=41, 58}}{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=126–127}} but the Arab–Khazar military confrontation also involved sporadic raids and isolated clashes from the middle of the 7th century to the end of the 8th century.

The Arab–Khazar wars were a result of the attempts of the Umayyad Caliphate to secure control of [[Transcaucasia]] and the [[North Caucasus]], where the Khazars were already established. The first Arab invasion, in the 640s and early 650s, ended with the defeat of an Arab force led by [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]] outside the Khazar town of [[Balanjar]]. Hostilities broke out again with the Caliphate in the 710s, with raids back and forth across the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. Led by the distinguished generals [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah]] and [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]], the Arabs were able to capture [[Derbent]] and even the southern Khazar capital of Balanjar, but these successes had little impact on the nomadic Khazars, who continued to launch devastating raids deep into Transcaucasia. In one such raid in 730, the Khazars inflicted a major defeat on the Umayyad forces at the [[Battle of Ardabil]], killing al-Jarrah, but were in turn defeated the next year and pushed back north. Maslama then recovered Derbent, which became a major Arab military outpost and colony, before being replaced by Marwan ibn Muhammad (the future caliph [[Marwan II]]) in 732. A period of relatively localized warfare followed until 737, when Marwan led north a massive expedition that reached the Khazar capital [[Atil]] on the Volga. After securing some form of submission by the ''khagan'', the Arabs withdrew.

The 737 campaign marked the end of large-scale warfare between the two powers, establishing Derbent as the northernmost Muslim outpost and securing Muslim dominance over Transcaucasia. At the same time, the continuing warfare weakened the Umayyad army and contributed to the eventual fall of the dynasty to the [[Abbasid Revolution]] a few years later. Relations between the Muslims of the Caucasus and the Khazars remained largely peaceful thereafter, apart from two Khazar raids in the 760s and in 799, resulting from failed efforts to secure an [[Marriage of state|alliance through marriage]] between the Arab governors or local princes of the Caucasus and the Khazar ''khagan''. Occasional warfare continued in the region between the Khazars and the Muslim principalities of the Caucasus until the collapse of the Khazar state in the late 10th century, but the great wars of the 8th century were never repeated.

==Strategic background and motives==
===The Caucasus as a frontier between the steppe and the settled world===
[[File:Mauer von Derbend.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Old geophysical map of the environs of Derbent, with the fortifications of Derbent outlined|Map of the Sassanid fortifications of the "Caspian Gates" at Derbent, by [[Roderich von Erckert]]]]
The Arab–Khazar wars were part of a long series of military conflicts between the nomadic peoples of the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] and the more settled regions south of the [[Caucasus]] range. The two primary routes over the mountains, the [[Darial Pass]] ("Alan Gates") in the centre and the Pass of [[Derbent]] ("[[Caspian Gates]]") in the east along the [[Caspian Sea]], have been used as invasion routes since [[Classical Antiquity]].{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=106}}{{sfn|Mako|2010|pp=50–53}} Consequently, the defence of the Caucasus frontier against the destructive raids of the steppe peoples such as the [[Scythians]] and the [[Huns]] came to be regarded as one of the chief duties of imperial regimes of the [[Near East]].{{sfn|Mako|2010|pp=50–53}} This is reflected in the popular belief among Middle Eastern cultures that [[Alexander the Great]] had [[Gates of Alexander|with divine assistance barred]] the Caucasus against the hordes of "[[Gog and Magog]]". As historian Gerald Mako points out, the latter were stereotypical "northern barbarians", as conceived by the settled civilizations of Eurasia: "uncivilized savages who drank blood, who ate children, and whose greed and bestiality knew no limits"; should Alexander's barrier fail and Gog and Magog break through, the [[Apocalypse]] would follow.{{sfn|Mako|2010|pp=50–51}}

Starting with [[Peroz I]] ({{reign|457|484}}), the shahs of the [[Sassanid Empire]] built a [[Fortifications of Derbent|line of stone fortifications]] to protect the vulnerable frontier along the Caspian shore; when completed under [[Khosrau I]] ({{reign|531|579}}), this stretched over {{convert|45|km|mi}} from the eastern foothills of the Caucasus to the Caspian Sea. The fortress of Derbent was the strategically crucial centre-point of this fortification complex, as evoked by its Persian name ''Dar-band'', "Knot of the Gates."{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=126}}{{sfn|Kemper|2013}}

===Opposing armies: the Arabs and the Khazars===
The [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Khazars]] appeared in the area of modern [[Daghestan]] in the latter half of the 6th century, initially as subjects of the [[Turkic Khaganate]], but following the latter's collapse, they emerged as an independent and dominant power in the area of the northern Caucasus by the 7th century.{{sfn|Kemper|2013}} As the most recent steppe power in the region, early medieval writers came to identify the Khazars with Gog and Magog,{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=7–8}} and the Sassanid fortifications at Derbent as Alexander's wall.{{sfn|Kemper|2013}}

Like other Near Eastern peoples, the [[Arabs]] were already familiar with the legend of Gog and Magog, who appear even in the ''[[Quran]]'' (''Yaʾjūj wa-Maʾjūj''). Following the [[Muslim conquests]], these perceptions were enhanced by incorporating many of the cultural conceptions of their new subjects.{{sfn|Mako|2010|p=52}} The nascent Muslim [[Caliphate]] regarded itself as heir to the Sassanid, and to a lesser extent, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], tradition and "civilizational consciousness". As a result, the Arab caliphs also adopted the notion that, in the words of Mako, it was their duty "to protect the settled, i.e. the civilized world from the northern barbarian". This imperative was further reinforced by the Muslim division of the world into the "House of Islam" or ''[[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam (House of Islam)|Dar al-Islam]]'' and the "House of War" (''[[Dar al-Harb]]''), to which the [[Tengrism|pagan]] Turkic steppe peoples like the Khazars were consigned.{{sfn|Mako|2010|pp=52–53}}{{efn|For more details, cf. {{EI3|last=Albrecht|first=Sarah|title=Dār al-Islām and dār al-ḥarb|year=2016|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_25867}} and the literature referenced there.}} 

The Arabs were "expansionists interested in conquest", unlike their Byzantine and Sassanid predecessors who simply sought to contain the steppe peoples by fortifications and political alliances. From the beginning, the Arabs actively pursued a northward expansion, quickly posing a direct threat to the survival of the Khazars as an independent polity.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2007|pp=374–375}} The eastern Caucasus range became the main theatre of the Arab–Khazar conflict, with the Arab armies aiming to gain control of Derbent (in Arabic, ''Bab al-Abwab'' or "Gate of Gates") and the Khazar cities of [[Balanjar]] and [[Samandar (city)|Samandar]]. Their locations have yet to be established with certainty by modern researchers, but both cities are referred to as Khazar capitals by different Arab writers, and may have functioned as winter and summer capitals respectively. It was only later, under the impact of the Arab attacks, that the Khazars moved their capital further north, to [[Atil]] (Arabic ''al-Bayda'') on the mouths of the [[Volga]].&lt;ref name="EI2-1173"&gt;{{harvnb|Barthold|Golden|1978|p=1173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposing armies represented different military philosophies, which derived from the nature of their societies. Arab armies contained sizeable contingents of both light and heavy cavalry, {{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=126}} but relied primarily on their infantry, to the extent that the Arab cavalry was often limited to skirmishing during the initial phases of a battle, before dismounting and fighting on foot.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=23–25}} While the Khazars had adopted elements of the civilizations of the south and possessed towns, they remained a largely tribal and semi-nomadic power. Like other steppe societies originating in [[Central Asia]], they practiced a very mobile form of warfare, relying on highly skilled and hardy cavalry. As the historian [[Khalid Yahya Blankinship]] writes, "the Khazars were to prove difficult opponents for the Muslims, perhaps partly because their state was not highly organized and thus did not have a center whose fall would bring about a sudden collapse and rapid surrender".{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=108}}

===Connection with the Arab–Byzantine conflict===
To an extent, the Arab–Khazar wars were also linked to the [[Arab–Byzantine wars|long-lasting struggle]] of the Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire along the eastern fringes of [[Asia Minor]], a theatre of war which adjoined the Caucasus. The [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]] pursued close relations with the Khazars, which amounted to a virtual alliance for most of the period in question, including such exceptional acts as the marriage of emperor [[Justinian II]] ({{reign|685|695|705|711}}) to a [[Theodora of Khazaria|Khazar princess]] in 705.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=108–109}}{{sfn|Lilie|1976|p=157}} The possibility of the Khazars linking up with the Byzantines through [[Medieval Armenia|Armenia]] was a grave threat to the Caliphate, especially given its proximity to the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]'s metropolitan province of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]].{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=106}} This did not materialize, and Armenia was left largely quiet, with the Umayyads granting it wide-ranging autonomy and the Byzantines likewise refraining from active campaigning there.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=107}} Indeed, given the common threat posed by the Khazar raids, the Umayyads found the Armenians (and the neighbouring [[Georgians]]) willing allies against the Khazars.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=109}} 

Some [[Byzantine studies|Byzantinists]], notably [[Dimitri Obolensky]], suggested that the Arab expansion against the Khazars was motivated by a desire to outflank the Byzantine defences from the north, and envelop the Byzantine Empire in a pincer movement. However, this idea is rejected as far-fetched by modern scholars. As historian David Wasserstein comments, it is a scheme of extraordinary ambition, which "requires us to accept that Byzantium had succeeded already at this primary stage in persuading the Muslims that it could not be conquered", and furthermore that the Muslims possessed "a far greater knowledge and understanding of the geography of Europe" than can be demonstrated for the time in question. Mako likewise remarks that such a grand strategic plan is not borne out by the rather limited nature of the Arab–Khazar conflict until the 720s.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2007|pp=377–378}}{{sfn|Mako|2010|pp=49–50}} It is more likely that the northward expansion of the Arabs beyond the Caucasus was, at least initially, the result of the onward momentum of the [[early Muslim conquests]], with the local Arab commanders seeking to exploit opportunities, haphazardly and without any overall planning. The expansion may even have been in direct contravention to caliphal orders, repeating a frequent pattern during this period.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2007|pp=378–379}} From a strategic perspective, it is far more probable that it was the Byzantines who encouraged the Khazars to attack the Caliphate to relieve the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|mounting pressure]] on their own eastern frontier in the early 8th century,{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=109}} as indeed Byzantium profited considerably from the diversion of the Muslim armies northwards in the 720s and 730s, resulting in another alliance through marriage, between the future emperor [[Constantine V]] ({{reign|741|775}}) and the Khazar princess [[Tzitzak]] in 733.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=149–154}}{{sfn|Lilie|1976|pp=157–160}}

Gaining control over the northern branch of the [[Silk Road]] by the Caliphate has been suggested as a further motive for the conflict, but Mako disputes this claim by pointing out that warfare declined at precisely the period of the greatest expansion of traffic along the Silk Road, i.e. after the middle of the 8th century.{{sfn|Mako|2010|pp=48–49}}

==First Arab–Khazar War and aftermath==

The Khazars themselves first campaigned in the Caucasus during the [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628]], as subjects of the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]]. The Turks sacked Derbent and joined the Byzantines in their siege of [[Tiflis]]. Their contribution proved decisive for the eventual Byzantine victory in the war. For a few years afterwards, until {{circa|632}}, the Khazars exercised some control over [[Caucasian Iberia]] (approximately modern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), [[Caucasian Albania]] (modern [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]) and Adharbayjan (modern [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]).{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=133–135}}

The Khazars and the Arabs came into conflict as a result of the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]: by 640, the Arabs had reached Armenia,{{sfn|Lilie|1976|p=54}}{{sfn|Gocheleishvili|2014}} and in 642, they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]].{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=126}}&lt;ref name="EI2-1173"/&gt; This raid reached Derbent, where, according to the ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' of [[al-Tabari]], the Persian governor, Shahrbaraz, offered to surrender the fortress to the Arabs and even to aid them against the unruly native Caucasian peoples, if he and his followers were relieved of the obligation to pay the ''[[jizya]]'' tax. The proposal was accepted and ratified by Caliph [[Umar]] ({{reign|634|644}}).{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=47–49}} 

In 645/646, the Arabs defeated a Byzantine army, reinforced with Khazar and [[Alans|Alan]] contingents, in Armenia.{{sfn|Lilie|1976|p=54}} As a result, Arab authority in Transcaucasia was more firmly established in the early 650s: in 652 the Armenian nobility, led by [[Theodore Rshtuni]], recognized the Caliphate's overlordship, and in 654, following an abortive Armenian uprising, Arab authority was extended over Iberia as well.{{sfn|Gocheleishvili|2014}} 

Al-Tabari reports that the first Arab advance into Khazar lands occurred as early as 642, claiming that Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah reached Balanjar, without suffering any losses, and that his cavalry raided up to 200 [[parasang]]s—about {{convert|800|km|mi}}—to the north of it, but both his dating and the improbable claim that the Arabs suffered no casualties have been disputed by modern scholars.&lt;ref name="EI2-1173"/&gt;{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=50–51}} Based at Derbent, Abd ar-Rahman led frequent raids against the Khazars over the following years, but these were small-scale affairs, and no event of major note is recorded in the sources.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=51–54}} In 651/652, disregarding the instructions of the Caliph urging caution and restraint, Abd ar-Rahman led a strong army north, aiming to take Balanjar. The town was besieged for a few days, until the arrival of a Khazar relief force, coupled with a general sortie of the besieged forces, ended in a [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|heavy defeat]] for the Arabs. Abd ar-Rahman (or, according to [[al-Baladhuri]], Abd ar-Rahman's brother [[Salman ibn Rabiah|Salman]]) and 4,000 Muslim troops were left dead on the field.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=55–57}} Three years later, the Khazars repelled a retaliatory campaign under [[Habib ibn Maslama]].{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=126}} In the aftermath of these attacks, the Khazars abandoned Balanjar and moved their capital further north, in an attempt to evade the reach of the Arab armies.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2007|p=375}}

Due to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and the priorities on other fronts, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.{{sfn|Mako|2010|p=45}} The Khazars, on their part, only launched a few raids into the [[Transcaucasia]]n principalities that were loosely under Muslim dominion: in a raid into Albania in 661/662, they were defeated by the local prince, but in 683 or 685 (also a time of [[Second Fitna|civil war]] in the Muslim world), a large-scale raid across Transcaucasia was more successful, capturing much booty and many prisoners. The presiding princes of Iberia ([[Adarnase II of Iberia|Adarnase II]]) and Armenia ([[Grigor I Mamikonian]]) were killed trying to oppose that raid.{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=126–127}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=59–60}}
{{anchor|Second War}}

==Second Arab–Khazar War==
[[File:Крепость Нарын-Кала. Дербент.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of an ochre-coloured medieval fortress on a green hilltop, with higher green hills in the background|[[Naryn-Kala]], the medieval citadel of Derbent, today]]

Relations between the two powers remained relatively quiet until the early years of the 8th century, by which time the stage for a new round of conflict was set: Byzantine political authority had been marginalized in the Caucasus, and the Caliphate tightened its grip on Armenia after the suppression of a large-scale rebellion in 705, placing it under direct Arab rule as the province of ''[[Arminiya]]''. The Arabs and the Khazars now directly confronted each other for control of the Caucasus. Only the western parts of Transcaucasia, comprising modern Georgia, remained free from direct control by either of the two rival powers.{{sfn|Cobb|2011|p=236}} 

Conflicting notices place the resumption of the conflict as early as 707, with a campaign by the Umayyad general [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslama]], a son of Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|685|705}}), in [[Adharbayjan]] and up to Derbent, which appears to have been under Khazar control at the time. Further attacks on Derbent are reported by different sources for 708 under [[Muhammad ibn Marwan]] and in the next year again by Maslama, but the most likely correct date for the recovery of Derbent is Maslama's expedition in 713/714.&lt;ref name="EI2-1173"/&gt;{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=60}}{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=127}} Maslama then drove deeper into Khazar territory, trying, without much success, to subdue the [[North Caucasian Huns|Huns living north of the Caucasus]] (who were Khazar vassals). The Khazars opposed him under the general [[Alp Tarkhan|Alp']], but also launched raids to the south into Albania in response.&lt;ref name="EI2-1173"/&gt;{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=127}} In 717, the Khazars raided in force into Adharbayjan, but they were driven back by the Arabs under Hatin ibn al-Nu'man. Hatin returned to the Caliph with fifty Khazar prisoners, the first such event recorded in the sources.{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=127}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=60–61}}

===Escalation of the conflict===
In 721/722, the main phase of the war began. In the winter of this year, 30,000 Khazars invaded Armenia and inflicted a crushing defeat on the mostly Syrian army of the local governor Mi'laq ibn Saffar al-Bahrani at Marj al-Hijara in February and March 722.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=121–122}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=61–62}} In response, Caliph [[Yazid II]] ({{reign|720|724}}) sent one of his most celebrated generals, [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah]], with 25,000 Syrian troops north.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}} On the news of his approach, the Khazars retreated to the vicinity of Derbent, whose Muslim garrison was still holding out. Advancing swiftly, al-Jarrah was able to enter Derbent without facing resistance, and launched raiding columns into Khazar territory.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=62–63}} Following with the bulk of his own army, he defeated a 40,000-strong Khazar army under [[Barjik]], one of the Khazar ''[[khagan]]''{{'}}s sons, one day's march north of Derbent. Advancing north, the Arab army captured the settlements of Khamzin and Targhu, whose inhabitants were resettled elsewhere.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=63–64}} Finally, the Arab army reached Balanjar. The city had featured strong fortifications during the first Muslim attacks in the mid-7th century, but apparently they had been neglected in the meantime, for the Khazars [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|chose to defend their capital]] by ringing the citadel with a [[laager]] of wagons. The Arabs broke it apart and stormed the city on 21 August 722. Most of Balanjar's inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few, including its governor, managed to flee north. The booty seized by the Arabs was so enormous that each of the 30,000 horsemen—probably an exaggeration by later historians—in the Arab army is said to have received 300 [[gold dinar]]s from it.{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=127}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=64–65}} 

Some of the Khazar prisoners were drowned on al-Jarrah's orders. His army reduced the neighbouring fortresses as well, and continued their march north. The strongly garrisoned fortress of Wabandar capitulated in exchange for tribute, but the Arab advance was cut short before reaching the next important Khazar settlement, Samandar.{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=127}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=65–66}} Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the main Khazar army, which like all nomad forces was not dependent on cities for supplies. The presence of this force near Samandar, as well as reports of rebellions among the mountain tribes in his rear, forced the Arabs to retreat to [[Warthan]] south of the Caucasus.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=66}} On his return, al-Jarrah reported on his campaign to the Caliph, but requested additional troops to defeat the Khazars, an indication of both the severity of the fighting and perhaps, according to Blankinship, that his campaign was not such a resounding success as portrayed in the Muslim sources.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=66}}

[[File:The student's manual of ancient geography, based upon the Dictionary of Greek and Roman geography (1861) (14769210685).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white sketch of a mountain defile, with a river crossed by a bridge|The [[Darial Pass]] {{circa|1861}}]]
The sources are obscure on al-Jarrah's activity in 723, but he seems to have led another campaign north beyond Balanjar (which may be an echo, or possibly the actual date, of the Balanjar campaign of 722).{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=66}} In response, the Khazars raided south of the Caucasus, but in February 724, al-Jarrah inflicted a crushing defeat on them in a battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]] that lasted for several days.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}} The new caliph, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|724|743}}), promised to send reinforcements, but eventually failed to do so. Nevertheless, in 724 al-Jarrah captured Tiflis and brought Caucasian Iberia and the lands of the Alans under Muslim suzerainty, becoming the first Muslim commander to campaign through the Darial Pass in the process. This secured the Muslims' own flank against a possible Khazar attack through the Darial, and gave them a second invasion route into Khazar territory.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=122–123}}

In 725, the Caliph replaced al-Jarrah with his own brother Maslama, who already held the post of governor of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]].{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=127}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=123}} The appointment of Maslama testifies to the importance placed by the Caliph on the Khazar front, for he was one of the most distinguished generals of the Umayyad empire.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=67}} For the time being, Maslama remained in the Jazira and was more concerned with operations against the Byzantines. In his stead, he sent [[al-Harith ibn Amr al-Ta'i]] to the Caucasus front. In 725, al-Harith was engaged in consolidating Muslim authority in Caucasian Albania, campaigning along the Cyrus against the regions of [[Lezgistan|al-Lakz]] and Khasmadan. He was probably also preoccupied with supervising that year's census.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=67}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=123–124}} The next year, Barjik launched a major invasion of Albania and Adharbayjan. The Khazars even laid siege to Warthan, during which they employed [[mangonels]]. The use of such advanced [[siege machines]] shows, according to Blankinship, that the Khazars were "a militarily sophisticated nation, not a mere disorganized pack of barbarians". Al-Harith was able to defeat them on the banks of the Araxes and drive them back north of the river, but the Arabs' position was clearly precarious.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=67}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=124}}

This event prompted Maslama to take over personally the direction of the Khazar front in 727, where now he was faced, for the first time, by the ''khagan'' himself, as both sides escalated the conflict. Maslama, probably reinforced with more Syrian and Jaziran troops, took the offensive. He recovered the Darial Pass, apparently lost in the period since al-Jarrah's expedition in 724, and pushed on into Khazar territory, campaigning there until the onset of winter forced him to return to Adharbayjan.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=67–68}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=124}} Whatever Maslama's achievements in this expedition, they were not enough. The next year, when he repeated his invasion, it ended in what Blankinship calls a "near disaster". Arab sources report that the Umayyad troops fought for thirty or even forty days in the mud, under continuous rainfall, before scoring a victory against the ''khagan'' on 17 September 728. How great that victory was, however, is open to question, because on his return Maslama was ambushed by the Khazars, whereupon the Arabs simply abandoned their baggage train and fled headlong through the Darial Pass to safety.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=68}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=124–125}} In the aftermath of this campaign, Maslama was replaced yet again by al-Jarrah al-Hakami. For all his energy, Maslama's campaigning failed to produce the desired results: by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and been thrust once more on the defensive, with al-Jarrah again having to defend Adharbayjan against a Khazar invasion.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=68}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=125, 149}}

===Ardabil and the Arab reaction===

In 729/730, al-Jarrah returned to the offensive through Tiflis and the Darial Pass. Arab sources report that he reached as far as the Khazar capital, al-Bayda, on the Volga, but modern historians such as Dunlop and Blankinship consider this improbable. The Khazars launched a counterstroke under a certain Tharmach, which forced al-Jarrah to retreat south of the Caucasus once again to defend Albania. It is unclear whether the Khazars came through the Darial Pass or the Caspian Gates, but they managed to move around al-Jarrah's army at [[Bardha'a]] and lay siege to [[Ardabil]]. The city was the capital of Adharbayjan, and the mass of the Muslim settlers and their families, some 30,000 in total, lived within its walls. When al-Jarrah learned of this, he led his army in a rapid march south and engaged the Khazars outside the city walls. There, after a [[Battle of Ardabil|three-day battle]] on 7–9 December 730, al-Jarrah's army of 25,000 was all but annihilated by the Khazars under Barjik.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=68–71}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=149–150}}{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=127–128}} Al-Jarrah was among the fallen, and command passed to his brother al-Hajjaj, who was unable to prevent the sacking of Ardabil. The 10th-century historian [[Agapius of Hierapolis]] reports that the Khazars took as many as 40,000 prisoners from the city, al-Jarrah's army, and the surrounding countryside. The Khazars raided the province at will, sacking [[Gənzə, Nakhchivan|Ganza]] and attacking other settlements, with some detachments reaching as far as [[Mosul]] in the northern Jazira, adjacent to the Umayyad metropolitan province of Syria.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=150}}{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=128}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=70–71}}

The defeat at Ardabil was a major shock to the Muslims, who for the first time faced an enemy penetrating so deep within the borders of the Caliphate, and Caliph Hisham appointed the veteran military leader [[Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi]] to take command against the Khazars in the short term, while Maslama prepared to march against them. Although the forces he could muster immediately (including refugees from Ardabil who had to be paid ten gold dinars to be persuaded to fight) were small, Sa'id managed to recover [[Akhlat]] on [[Lake Van]]. From there he moved northeast to Bardha'a and south again to relieve the siege of Warthan. Near [[Bajarwan (town)|Bajarwan]] Sa'id came upon a 10,000-strong Khazar army, which he defeated, killing most of the Khazars, and rescuing the 5,000 Muslim prisoners they had with them. The surviving Khazars fled north, with Sa'id in pursuit.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=71–73}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=150–151}} Despite this success, Sa'id was relieved of his command in early 731 and even imprisoned for a while at [[Qabala]] and Bardha'a as a result of the jealousy of Maslama, whom Hisham had re-appointed as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=74–76}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=151}} 

Maslama came to the Caucasus with many Jaziran troops and took the offensive. He restored the provinces of Albania to Muslim allegiance after meting out exemplary punishment to the inhabitants of Khaydhan, who resisted his advance, and reached Derbent, where he found a Khazar garrison of 1,000 men with their families installed. Bypassing the fortress, Maslama advanced north. Although the details of this campaign in the sources may be confused with that of 728, it appears that he took Khamzin, Balanjar, and Samandar before being forced to retreat again after a confrontation with the bulk of the Khazar army under the ''khagan'' himself. Leaving their campfires burning, the Arabs withdrew in the middle of the night, and in a series of forced marches covering twice the usual distance, reached Derbent. The 
Khazars shadowed Maslama's march south and attacked him near Derbent, but the Arab army, augmented by local levies, resisted their onslaught until a small picked force attacked the ''khagan''{{'}}s tent and wounded the Khazar ruler himself. Taking heart, the Muslims attacked and defeated the Khazars. It is probably this battle or campaign in which Barjik was reportedly killed.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=76–79}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=151–152}} Taking advantage of his victory, Maslama evicted the Khazars from Derbent by poisoning their water supply and re-founded the city as a military colony, garrisoning it with 24,000 mostly Syrian troops divided into quarters by the districts (''[[jund]]'') of their origin. After that he returned with the rest of his army (mostly the favoured Jaziran and [[Jund Qinnasrin|Qinnasrini]] contingents) south of the Caucasus for the winter, while the Khazars re-occupied their abandoned towns. Despite the capture of Derbent, Maslama's record was apparently unsatisfactory for Hisham, who replaced his brother in March 732 with [[Marwan II|Marwan ibn Muhammad]], who would later reign as the last Umayyad caliph in 744–750.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=152}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=79–80}}

In the summer of 732, Marwan led 40,000 men north into Khazar lands. The accounts of this campaign are confused: [[Ibn A'tham]] records that he reached Balanjar and returned to Derbent with much captured livestock, but the campaign is described in terms strongly reminiscent of Maslama's expeditions in 728 and 731, and its veracity is open to doubt. [[Ibn Khayyat]] on the other hand reports that Marwan led a far more limited campaign on the country immediately to the north of Derbent and then retired there to spend the winter.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=152–153}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=80}} Marwan was more active in the south, where he raised [[Ashot III Bagratuni]] to the position of presiding prince of Armenia, effectively granting the country broad autonomy in exchange for the service of its soldiers alongside the Caliphate's armies. This unique concession points, according to Blankinship, to the worsening manpower crisis faced by the Caliphate.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=153}}{{sfn|Cobb|2011|p=237}} At about the same time, the Khazars and Byzantines strengthened their ties and formalized their alliance against their common enemy with the marriage of Constantine V to the Khazar princess Tzitzak.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=153–154}}{{sfn|Lilie|1976|pp=157–158}}

===Final phase of the war: Marwan's invasion of Khazaria===
After Marwan's 732 expedition, a period of quiet set in. Marwan was replaced as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan in spring 733 by Sa'id al-Harashi, but he undertook no campaigns during the two years of his governorship.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=80}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=170–171}} Blankinship attributes this inactivity to the exhaustion of the Arab armies and draws a parallel with [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana|the contemporaneous quiet phase]] in [[Transoxiana]] in 732–734, where the Arabs had also suffered a series of costly defeats at the hands of a Turkic steppe power.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=171}} In the meantime, Marwan is reported to have gone before Caliph Hisham and remonstrated against the policy followed in the Caucasus, recommending that he himself be sent to deal with the Khazars, with full authority and an army of 120,000 men. When Sa'id requested to be relieved in 735 due to his failing eyesight, Hisham appointed Marwan to replace him.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=80}}

Marwan returned to the Caucasus determined to launch a decisive blow against the Khazars, but it appears that he too was unable to launch anything but local expeditions for some time. He established a new base of operations at Kasak, some twenty [[Parsang|parsangs]] from Tiflis and forty from Bardha'a, but his initial expeditions were against minor local potentates.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=171–172}} In 735, Marwan captured three fortresses in Alania, near the Darial Pass, and the ruler of a North Caucasian principality, Tuman Shah, who was restored to his lands by the Caliph as a client ruler. In the next year, Marwan campaigned against another local prince, Wartanis, whose castle was seized and its defenders killed despite their surrender; Wartanis himself tried to flee, but was captured and executed by the inhabitants of Khamzin.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=171–172}} Indeed, Agapius and [[Michael the Syrian]] record that the Arabs and the Khazars concluded peace during this period, information which Muslim sources ignore or downplay as a short-lived ruse by Marwan designed to gain time for his preparations and mislead the Khazars as to his intentions.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=81}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=171}}

[[File:Анакопийская крепость.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a ruined medieval stone-built fortress on a green hilltop in autumn, with the Caucasus mountains in the background|The medieval citadel of Anakopia today]]
Marwan prepared a massive strike for 737, intended to end the war for good. Marwan apparently went to [[Damascus]] in person to persuade Hisham to back this project and was successful: the 10th-century historian [[Bal'ami]] claims that his army numbered 150,000 men, comprising regular forces of Syria and the Jazira, as well as volunteers for the ''jihad'', Armenian troops under Ashot Bagratuni, and even armed camp followers and servants. Whatever the real size of Marwan's army, it was a huge force and certainly the largest ever sent against the Khazars.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=172}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=81}} Marwan first secured his rear by subduing the Armenian factions who were hostile to the Arabs and their client Ashot. He then [[Marwan ibn Muhammad's invasion of Georgia|pushed into Caucasian Iberia]], driving its [[Chosroid Dynasty|Chosroid]] ruler to seek refuge in the fortress of [[Anakopia]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, in the Byzantine protectorate of [[Kingdom of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]]. Marwan laid siege to Anakopia itself, but he was forced to retire due to the outbreak of [[dysentery]] among his troops.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=172}}

Marwan now launched a two-pronged offensive against the Khazars: 30,000 men (including most of the levies from the Caucasian principalities) under the governor of Derbent, [[Asid ibn Zafir al-Sulami]], advanced north along the coast of the Caspian Sea, while Marwan himself with the bulk of his forces crossed the Darial Pass. The invasion met little resistance; the Arab sources report that Marwan had deliberately detained the Khazar envoy and only let him go with a declaration of war once he was deep in Khazar territory. The two Arab armies converged on Samandar, where a great review was held; according to Ibn A'tham, the troops were issued new clothing in white—the dynastic colour of the Umayyads—as well as new spears.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=172}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=81–82}} From there Marwan pushed on, reaching, according to some Arab sources, the Khazar capital of al-Bayda on the Volga. The ''khagan'' withdrew towards the [[Ural Mountains]], but left behind a considerable force to protect the capital.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=82–83}} This was a "spectacularly deep penetration", according to Blankinship, but of little strategic value: the 10th-century travellers [[Ibn Fadlan]] and [[Istakhri]] describe the Khazar capital in their time as little more than a large encampment, and there is no evidence that it had been larger or more urbanized in the past.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=172–173}} 

[[File:Samosdelskoye gorodische7.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of people in shirtsleeves working amidst the excavated foundations of ancient buildings|Excavations at [[Samosdelka]], identified by some archaeologists with the Khazar capital al-Bayda/Atil{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=21}}]]
The subsequent course of the campaign is only provided by Ibn A'tham and the sources drawn from his work. According to this account, Marwan penetrated further north, and attacked a Slavic people called Burtas, whose territory extended up to that of the [[Volga Bulgars]] and who were Khazar subjects, taking 20,000 families (or 40,000 persons, in other accounts) captive. The Khazar army, under the ''[[tarkhan]]'' (one of the highest dignitaries in Turkic states), shadowed the Arab advance from the opposite shore of the Volga. As the Khazars avoided battle, Marwan sent a detachment of 40,000 troops across the Volga under al-Kawthar ibn al-Aswad al-'Anbari, which surprised the Khazars in a swamp. In the ensuing battle, the Arabs killed 10,000 Khazars, including the ''tarkhan'', and took 7,000 captives.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=83–84}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=173}} Thereupon the Khazar ''khagan'' himself is said to have requested peace. Marwan reportedly offered "Islam or the sword", whereupon the ''khagan'' agreed to convert to Islam. Two ''[[faqih]]s'' were sent to instruct him on the details of the faith—the prohibition on consuming wine, pork, and [[Islamic dietary laws|unclean meat]] are specifically mentioned.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|p=84}}&lt;ref name="EI2-1174"&gt;{{harvnb|Barthold|Golden|1978|p=1174}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marwan also took with him large numbers of Slav and Khazar captives, whom he resettled in the eastern Caucasus: some 20,000 Slavs were settled at [[Kakheti]], according to al-Baladhuri, while the Khazars were resettled at al-Lakz. Soon after, the Slavs killed their appointed governor and fled north, but Marwan rode after them and killed them.&lt;ref name="EI2-1174"/&gt;{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=174}}{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=179}}

Marwan's 737 expedition was the climax of the Arab–Khazar wars, but its actual results were meagre. Although the Arab campaigns after Ardabil may indeed have discouraged the Khazars from further warfare,{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=174}} any recognition of Islam or of Arab supremacy by the ''khagan'' was evidently conditional upon the presence of Arab troops deep in Khazar territory, and such presence could not be sustained for long.&lt;ref name="EI2-1174"/&gt; Furthermore, the credibility of the conversion of the ''khagan'' to Islam is disputed: al-Baladhuri's account, which probably is closer the original sources, suggests that it was not the ''khagan'' but a minor lord who converted to Islam and was placed in charge of the Khazars at al-Lakz—in itself, according to Blankinship, an indication of the implausibility of the conversion of the ''khagan'', if the Khazar Muslim converts had to be removed to safety in Umayyad territory.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=173}} The conversion of the ''khagan'' is also apparently contradicted by the fact that {{circa|740}} the Khazar court embraced [[Judaism]] as its official faith,{{efn|This is the traditional date, which is disputed by more recent studies that put the Khazars' conversion to Judaism in the 9th century, cf. {{harvnb|Brook|2006|pp=106–114}}.}} a decision which clearly owed a great deal to the determination of the Khazars to avoid assimilation by, and emphasize their independence from, both the Christian Byzantine and the Muslim Arab empires.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=173–174}}

===Aftermath and impact of the Second Arab–Khazar War===
Whatever the real events of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737.{{sfn|Cobb|2011|p=237}} Arab military activity in the Caucasus continued until 741, with Marwan launching repeated expeditions against the various principalities of the northern Caucasus.{{efn|The Arab sources list expeditions to extract tribute (in the form of a levy of slaves and annual grain supplies to Derbent) as well as impose obligations of military assistance against the principalities of [[Sarir]], Ghumik, Khiraj or Khizaj, Tuman, Sirikaran, Khamzin, Sindan (also found as Sughdan or Masdar), Layzan or al-Lakz, [[Tabarsaran]], [[Sharwan]], and [[Filan]].{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=174–175, 331–332 (notes 36–47)}}}}{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=85, 86–87}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=174–175}} Blankinship emphasizes that these campaigns appear to have been closer to raids, designed to seize plunder and extract tribute to ensure the upkeep of the Arab army, rather than attempts at permanent conquest.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=175}} On the other hand, the British orientalist [[Douglas M. Dunlop]] considered that Marwan came "within an ace of succeeding" in his conquest of Khazaria, and that he "apparently intended to resume operations against the ''khagan'' at a later date", but this never materialized.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=86–87}}

Despite the Umayyads' success at establishing a more or less stable frontier anchored at Derbent,{{sfn|Cobb|2011|p=236}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=175}} they were unable to push any further, despite repeated efforts, in the face of vigorous Khazar resistance. Dunlop drew parallels between the Umayyad–Khazar confrontation at the Caucasus and that between the Umayyads and the [[Frankish Kingdom|Franks]] at roughly the same time across the [[Pyrenees]] that ended in the [[Battle of Tours]], noting that, like the Franks in the west, the Khazars played a crucial role in stemming the tide of the early Muslim conquests.{{sfn|Dunlop|1954|pp=46–47, 87}} Blankinship also highlights the limited gains made by the Caliphate in the Second Arab–Khazar War as disproportionate to the resources expended: Arab control was in reality limited to the lowlands and coast, and the land itself was too poor to recompense the Umayyad treasury. More importantly, the need to maintain the large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched Syro-Jaziran army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=175}} Eventually, the weakening of the Syrian army through its dispersion across the various fronts of the Caliphate would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the [[Third Fitna|Muslim civil wars of the 740s]] and the [[Abbasid Revolution]] that followed them.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=223–225, 230–236}}

==Later conflicts==
[[File:The Carolingian and Byzantine Empires and the Califate about 814.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Old map of Europe and the Mediterranean basin showing the polities of the year 814 in various colours|Map of Europe and the Mediterranean in the early 9th century, from William R. Shepherd's ''Historical Atlas''.&lt;br&gt;{{legend2|#ffe5ac|[[Abbasid Caliphate]]}} {{legend2|#fce2c9|[[Khazar Khaganate]]}} {{legend2|#e8e9af|[[Byzantine Empire]]}} {{legend2|#decfb8|[[Carolingian Empire]]}}]]
The Khazars resumed their raids on Muslim territory after the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] succession, reaching deep into Transcaucasia. Although by the 9th century the Khazars had re-consolidated their control over [[Dagestan]] almost to the gates of Derbent itself, they never seriously attempted to challenge Muslim control of the southern Caucasus.&lt;ref name="EI2-1174"/&gt;

The first conflict between the Khazars and the Abbasids resulted from a diplomatic manoeuvre by the Caliph [[al-Mansur]] ({{reign|754|775}}). Attempting to strengthen the Caliphate's ties with the Khazars, in {{circa|760}} he ordered his governor of Armenia, [[Yazid ibn Asid ibn Zafir al-Sulami|Yazid al-Sulami]], to marry a daughter of the ''khagan'' [[Baghatur]]. The marriage indeed took place amidst much celebration, but she died in childbirth two years later, along with her infant child. The ''khagan'' suspected the Muslims of poisoning his daughter, and launched devastating raids south of the Caucasus in 762–764: under the leadership of a [[Khwarezm]]ian ''tarkhan'' named [[Ras Tarkhan|Ras]], the Khazars devastated Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, where they captured Tiflis. Yazid himself managed to escape capture, but the Khazars returned north with thousands of captives and much booty.&lt;ref name="EI2-1174"/&gt;{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=129–130}} A few years later, however, in 780, when the deposed Iberian ruler [[Nerse of Iberia|Nerse]] tried to induce the Khazars to campaign against the Abbasids and restore him to his throne, the ''khagan'' refused. This was probably the result of a brief period of anti-Byzantine orientation in Khazar foreign policy, resulting from disputes between the two powers in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. During the same period, the Khazars helped [[Leon II of Abkhazia]] throw off Byzantine overlordship.&lt;ref name="EI2-1174"/&gt;{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=131–132}}

Peace reigned in the Caucasus between Arabs and Khazars until 799, when the last major Khazar attack into Transcaucasia took place. Chroniclers again attribute this attack to a failed marriage alliance.&lt;ref name="EI2-1174"/&gt; According to Georgian sources, the ''khagan'' desired to marry the beautiful Shushan, daughter of Prince [[Archil of Kakheti]] ({{reign|736|786}}), and he sent his general Buljan to invade Iberia and capture her. Most of the central region of [[K'art'li]] was occupied, and Prince [[Juansher of Kakheti|Juansher]] ({{reign|786|807}}) was taken off into captivity for a few years, but rather than be captured, Shushan committed suicide, and the furious ''khagan'' had Buljan executed.{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=130–131}} Arab chroniclers, on the other hand, attribute this to the plans of the Abbasid governor [[al-Fadl ibn Yahya]] (one of the famous [[Barmakids]]) to marry one of the ''khagan''{{'}}s daughters, who died on her journey south, while a different story is reported  by al-Tabari, whereby the Khazars were invited to attack by a local Arab magnate in retaliation against the execution of his father, the governor of Derbent, by the general [[Sa'id ibn Salm]]. According to the Arab sources, the Khazars then raided as far as the Araxes, necessitating the dispatch of troops under [[Yazid ibn Mazyad]], as the new governor of Transcaucasia, with more forces under [[Khazim ibn Khuzayma]] in reserve.&lt;ref name="EI2-1174"/&gt;{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=131–132}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=170–171}}

Arabs and Khazars continued to clash sporadically in the North Caucasus in the 9th and 10th centuries, but warfare was localized and of far lower intensity than the great wars of the 8th century. Thus the Ottoman historian [[Munejjim-bashi Ahmed Dede|Münejjim Bashi]] records a period of warfare lasting from {{circa|901}} until 912, perhaps linked to the [[Caspian raids of the Rus']] at about the same time, whom the Khazars allowed to pass through their lands unhindered.{{sfn|Barthold|Golden|1978|pp=1175–1176}} The Khazar threat receded with the progressive collapse of Khazar power in the 10th century and defeats at the hands of the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] and other Turkic nomads like the [[Oghuz Turks]]. The Khazar realm contracted to its core around the lower Volga, and became removed from reach of the Arab Muslim principalities of the Caucasus. Thus [[Ibn al-Athir]]'s reports of a war between the [[Shaddadids]] of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] with the "Khazars" in 1030 probably refers to the Georgians instead. In the end, the last Khazars found refuge among their former enemies. Münejjim Bashi records that in 1064, "the remnants of the Khazars, consisting of three thousand households, arrived in Qahtan [somewhere in Dagestan] from the Khazar territory. They rebuilt it and settled in it".{{sfn|Barthold|Golden|1978|p=1176}}

'''Bala Turkvision Song Contest 2017''' ({{lang-tr|Bala Türkvizyon Şarkı Yarışması 2017}}) was to be the second edition of the [[Bala Turkvision Song Contest]], which was to take place at the [[Saryarka Velodrome]], in Astana, Kazakhstan; and organised by [[Adam Media Group]]. The contest was originally scheduled to take place in December 2016, but was cancelled due to on-going events in Turkey. Only five [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries|Turkic regions]], which have either a large Turkic population or a widely spoken Turkic language, confirmed their participation in the contest before it was cancelled for the second year running on October 20, 2017. As of now, the future of the Bala Turkvision Song Contest remains uncertain.

The contest was originally scheduled to take place in Turkey, but was later announced as being cancelled due to the [[December 2016 Istanbul bombings]], marking the first time since the inaugural contest in 2015 that a cancellation of the contest had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvision Song Contest delayed until March|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision-song-contest-delayed-march/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=8 December 2016|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017 it was announced by Ministry of Culture and Sports in Kazakhstan, that the 2017 edition would take place in [[Astana]], [[Kazakhstan]], and would coincide with other events taking place in the city as part of [[Expo 2017]].&lt;ref name="TSC2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvision Song Contest 2017 to be held in Kazakhstan|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision-song-contest-2017-to-be-held-in-kazakhstan/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=15 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barnet Fair''' is an annual horse and pleasure fair held near Mays Lane, [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], [[England]], on the first Monday in September.&lt;ref name="BarnetOnline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnet Market and Fair |url=http://www.barnet.gov.uk/index/leisure-culture/libraries/archives/archives-histories/archives-barnethistories/archives-barnet-barnetmarket.htm |work=Barnet Online |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607174613/http://www.barnet.gov.uk/index/leisure-culture/libraries/archives/archives-histories/archives-barnethistories/archives-barnet-barnetmarket.htm |archivedate=7 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Fair takes place over three days starting on 4 September. It still operates under its royal Charter which is issued by Barnet council. The focus in the present-day Fair is no longer on horses and other livestock; but it is rather a pleasure fair instead.

==History==
The fair began in 1588 when [[Queen Elizabeth I]] granted a charter to the Lord of the Manor of Barnet to hold a fair twice yearly, in addition to the weekly [[Barnet Market]].&lt;ref name="Barnet4U"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnet Fair |url=http://barnet4u.co.uk/Barnet%20History/barnetfair.html |work=Barnet 4U |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208035059/http://www.barnet4u.co.uk/Barnet%20History/barnetfair.html |archivedate=8 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally held in June and October, Lord John Tomlinson changed the dates to April and September in 1758 for the reason of improving business.&lt;ref name="Barnet4U"/&gt; From 1881, the April fair ceased.&lt;ref name="Barnet4U"/&gt;

The focus of the fair was its livestock, with animals being brought from across the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="BarnetOnline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnet4U"/&gt; In 1834, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Barnet Fair was England's largest cattle market, with up to 40,000 animals on display.&lt;ref name="Barnet4U"/&gt;

From the eighteenth century, the festivities also used to include horse racing, although these ceased in 1870 when the railway station was built on the ground in which they had been held.&lt;ref name="BarnetOnline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnet4U"/&gt;

==Popular culture==
In 1896, a film was made about Barnet Fair, entitled ''[[Barnet Horse Fair (film)|Barnet Horse Fair]]''.

The term 'Barnet Fair', normally shortened to 'Barnet', has become [[rhyming slang]] for 'hair'.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn, ''A Dictionary of Rhyming Slang'' ([[Routledge]], 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Barnet Fair" is the name of a song by [[Steeleye Span]].

== Nomenclature ==
Today the term ''bushmeat'' is commonly used for meat of [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] wild or feral mammals, killed for sustenance or commercial purposes throughout the humid [[tropics]] of the Americas, Asia, and Africa. In West Africa (primarily [[Ghana]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Nigeria]]), ''[[Achatina achatina]]'', a giant African snail, is also gathered, sold, eaten, and monitored as part of the bushmeat trade.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{cite web|author=Forestry Department|title=Wildlife utilization and food security in Africa|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w7540e/w7540e0i.htm|website=www.fao.org|publisher=FAO|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BCTF&gt;{{cite web|title=Document on the breeding of the giant African snail (Achatina achatina)|url=http://www.bushmeat.org/node/623|publisher=Bushmeat Crisis Task Force|accessdate=14 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214115207/http://www.bushmeat.org/node/623#|archive-date=2015-02-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ebola scares West Africans away from bush meat|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebola-virus-scares-west-africans-away-from-bush-meat/|accessdate=14 February 2015|agency=AP|publisher=CBS News|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reflect the global nature of [[hunting]] of wild animals, Resolution 2.64 of the [[IUCN]] General Assembly in [[Amman]] in October 2000 referred to ''wild meat'' rather than ''bushmeat''. A more worldwide term for terrestrial wild animals is [[game (food)|game]]. The term ''bushmeat crisis'' is sometimes used to describe unsustainable hunting of often [[Endangered species|endangered]] wild mammals in West and Central Africa and the humid tropics, depending on interpretation.  African hunting predates recorded history; by the 21st century, it had become an international issue.&lt;ref name="Ecosystems"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Current State and Trends.

== Extent ==
The volume of the bushmeat trade in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]] was estimated at 1-5&amp;nbsp;million tonnes per year at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = G. | title = Bushmeat and international development | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | year = 2002 | pages = 587–589 | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.01636.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Center for International Forestry Research]] (CIFOR) in 2014, approximately 5&amp;nbsp;million tonnes were still being consumed per year in the [[Congo Basin]].&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"/&gt;

For the people of this region, bushmeat represents a primary source of animal [[protein]] in the diet, making it a significant commercial industry.  According to a 1994 study in [[Gabon]], annual sales were estimated at US$50&amp;nbsp;million. The study found that bushmeat accounted for more than half of meat sold in local markets, with [[primates]] representing 20% of the total bushmeat.&lt;ref name="PanAfricaNews1996"/&gt;

=== Logging penetration of forests ===
[[Logging]] concessions operated by companies in African forests have been closely linked to the bushmeat trade. Because they provide roads, trucks and other access to remote forests, they are the primary means for the transportation of hunters and meat between forests and urban centres. Some, including the Congolaise Industrielle du Bois (CIB) in the [[Republic of Congo]], have partnered with governments and international conservation organizations to regulate the bushmeat trade within the concessions where they operate. Numerous solutions are needed; because each country has different circumstances, traditions and laws, no one solution will work in every location.&lt;ref&gt;Poulsen, J. R., Clark, C. J., Mavah, G., &amp; Elkan, P. W. (2009).

=== Overfishing ===
In the case of [[Ghana]], international over-exploitation of African [[Fisheries|fishing grounds]] has increased demand for bushmeat.  Both [[European Union|EU]]-subsidized fleets and local commercial fleets have depleted fish stocks, leaving local people to supplement their diets with animals hunted from nature reserves.  Over 30&amp;nbsp;years of data link sharp declines in both mammal populations and the biomass of 41&amp;nbsp;wildlife species with a decreased supply of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brashares | first1 = J.

=== Public preference ===
In the case of [[Liberia]] in West Africa, bushmeat is eaten widely and is considered a delicacy.&lt;ref name="Wynfred Russell"/&gt; A 2004 public opinion survey found that bushmeat ranked second behind fish among residents of the capital [[Monrovia]] as a preferred source of protein.&lt;ref name="Wynfred Russell"/&gt; Of households where bushmeat was served, 80% of residents said they cooked it "once in a while", while 13% cooked it once a week and 7% cooked bushmeat daily.&lt;ref name="Wynfred Russell"/&gt; The survey was conducted during the last civil war, and bushmeat consumption is now believed to be far higher.&lt;ref name="Wynfred Russell"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/op-ed/commentaries-features/380-extinction-is-forever-a-crisis-that-is-liberia-s-endangered-wildlife# |title="Extinction is forever: A crisis that is Liberia's endangered wildlife", Wynfred Russell |publisher=[[FrontPage Africa]] |access-date=2014-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191753/http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/op-ed/commentaries-features/380-extinction-is-forever-a-crisis-that-is-liberia-s-endangered-wildlife# |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in spread of diseases ==
The transmission of highly variable [[retrovirus]] chains causes [[zoonotic disease]]s. Outbreaks of the [[Ebola virus]] in the [[Congo Basin]] and in [[Gabon]] in the 1990s have been associated with the butchering of [[Pan (genus)|apes]] and consumption of their meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Georges-Courbot, M.

=== HIV ===
Results of research on wild [[Pan troglodytes troglodytes|chimpanzees]] in [[Cameroon]] indicate that they are naturally infected with the [[simian foamy virus]] and constitute a reservoir of [[HIV-1]], a precursor of the [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) in [[human]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keele | first1 = B.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have shown that HIV originated from a similar virus in primates called [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV); it is likely that HIV was initially transferred to humans after having come into contact with infected bushmeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Scientists find new strain of HIV | publisher = BBC News | date = 2 August 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8175379.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

=== Ebola ===
The Ebola virus, for which the primary host is suspected to be [[Megabat|fruit bats]], has been linked to bushmeat.  Between the first recorded outbreak in 1976 and the largest in 2014, the virus has [[Spillover infection|transferred from animals to humans]] only 30&amp;nbsp;times, despite large numbers of bats being killed and sold each year.&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"/&gt; Bats drop partially eaten fruits and pulp, then land mammals such as gorillas and [[duiker]]s feed on these fallen fruits. This chain of events forms a possible indirect means of transmission from the natural host to animal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gonzalez JP, Pourrut X, Leroy E |title=Ebolavirus and other filoviruses |journal=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |volume=315 |pages=363–387 |year=2007 |pmid=17848072 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-70962-6_15 |isbn=978-3-540-70961-9 |series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although primates and other species may be intermediates, evidence suggests people primarily contract the virus from bats.  Since most people buy smoked bushmeat, hunters and people preparing the food have the highest risk of infection. Hunters usually shoot, net, scavenge or catapult their prey, and butcher the bats without gloves, getting bites or scratches and coming in contact with their blood.&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Hogenboom | first1 = Melissa | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29604204 | publisher = BBC News | title = Ebola: Is bushmeat behind the outbreak? | date = October 18, 2014 | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=camghana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/understanding-the-bushmeat-market-why-do-people-risk-infection-from-bat-meat|title=Understanding the bushmeat market: why do people risk infection from bat meat?|work=Research News|publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the suspected [[index case]] for the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|Ebola outbreak in West Africa]] is a two-year-old child in [[Guéckédou Prefecture|Guéckédou]] in south-eastern Guinea, who was the child of a family that hunted two species of fruit bat,&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"/&gt; ''[[Hammer-headed bat|Hypsignathus monstrosus]]'' and ''[[Franquet's epauletted fruit bat|Epomops franqueti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/voice-field/struggling-contain-ebola-epidemic-west-africa | publisher = MSF USA | title = Struggling to Contain the Ebola Epidemic in West Africa | date = July 8, 2014 | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers suggested the case was caused by [[Zoonosis|zoonotic transmission]] through the child playing with an [[Microbat|insectivorous bat]] from a colony of [[Angolan free-tailed bat]]s near the village.&lt;ref name=EMBOMM123014&gt;{{cite journal|author=Almudena Marí Saéz|author2=Sabrina Weiss|author3=Kathrin Nowak|author4=Vincent Lapeyre|author5=Fee Zimmermann|author6=Ariane Düx|author7=Hjalmar S Kühl|author8=Moussa Kaba|author9=Sebastien Regnaut|author10=Kevin Merkel|author11=Andreas Sachse|author12=Ulla Thiesen|author13=Lili Villányi|author14=Christophe Boesch|author15=Piotr W Dabrowski|author16=Aleksandar Radonić|author17=Andreas Nitsche|author18=Siv Aina J Leendertz|author19=Stefan Petterson|author20=Stephan Becker|author21=Verena Krähling|author22=Emmanuel Couacy‐Hymann|author23=Chantal Akoua‐Koffi|author24=Natalie Weber|author25=Lars Schaade|author26=Jakob Fahr|author27=Matthias Borchert|author28=Jan F Gogarten|author29=Sébastien Calvignac‐Spencer|author30=Fabian H Leendertz|title=Investigating the zoonotic origin of the West African Ebola epidemic|journal=EMBO Molecular Medicine|date=December 30, 2014|issue=Published online|doi=10.15252/emmm.201404792|url=http://embomolmed.embopress.org/content/early/2014/12/29/emmm.201404792|accessdate=December 31, 2014|publisher=EMBO Press|format=online|quote=The severe Ebola virus disease epidemic occurring in West Africa likely stems from a single zoonotic transmission event involving a 2 year old boy in Meliandou, Guinea, who might have been infected by hunting or playing with insectivorous free‐tailed bats living in a nearby hollow tree|volume=7|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea/en/|title=Ground zero in Guinea: the outbreak smoulders – undetected – for more than 3 months|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite health organisations warning about risks of bushmeat, surveys pre-dating the 2014 outbreak indicate that people who eat bushmeat are usually unaware of the risks and view it as healthy food. Because of bushmeat's role as a protein source in Western Africa, it is traditionally associated with good nutrition, and efforts to outlaw the sale and consumption of bushmeat have been impossible to enforce and have met with suspicion from rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/239123/icode/|title=FAO warns of fruit bat risk in West African Ebola epidemic|work=FAO|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study in Ghana, none of the bushmeat hunters knew about Ghana's hunting laws, suggesting that bans may not be enforceable.&lt;ref name=camghana/&gt; The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that between 30 and 80 percent of protein intake in rural households in Central Africa comes from wild meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/news_151010.html|title=Bushmeat consumption, wildlife trade and global public health risks|work=FAO|date=15 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as [[Overpopulation|human populations grow]], the interactions between humans and wildlife will increase, making possible [[Zoonosis|zoonotic transmission]] of diseases from animal hosts more likely.&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"/&gt;

In many instances, contracting the diseases mentioned above often occurs due to the cutting of the meat, when animal blood and other fluids may touch the people cutting it, thereby infecting them.

[[File:Choeropsis.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Pygmy hippo]]s are among the species [[Environmental issues in Liberia|illegally hunted for food in Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Anne Look"/&gt; The [[World Conservation Union]] estimates that there are fewer than 3,000 pygmy hippos remaining in the wild.&lt;ref name="Redlist"&gt;{{IUCN |assessor=Ransom, C.|assessor2=Robinson, P.T. |assessor3=Collen, B. |last-assessor-amp=yes|year=2015 |id=10032|title=Choeropsis liberiensis |version=2016.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The consumption of bushmeat threatens a wide range of species, including species that are endangered and threatened with extinction. For example, a range of endangered species are hunted for bushmeat in Liberia.&lt;ref name="Anne Look"/&gt;

Species hunted for food in Liberia include [[elephants]], [[pygmy hippopotamus]], [[chimpanzees]], [[duikers]], and other monkeys.&lt;ref name="Anne Look"&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/article/370590.html  "Poaching in Liberia's Forests Threatens Rare Animals", Anne Look, [[Voice of America]] News, May 08, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Forest rangers in Liberia say that bushmeat poachers will kill any forest animal they encounter.&lt;ref name="Anne Look"/&gt;

=== Effect on great apes ===
[[File:Gorilla gorilla09.jpg|thumb|250px|A gorilla in the [[DR Congo]], 2008. The use of [[Shotgun shell#Buckshot|buckshot]] has helped bushmeat hunters target gorillas by allowing them to more easily kill the dominant male [[silverback]].]]

The great apes of Central and West Africa—gorillas and chimpanzees—are nearly ubiquitously sold as bushmeat throughout the region, and a study from 1995 suggests that the off-take is unsustainable.&lt;ref name="PanAfricaNews1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = A. L. | title = The African great ape bushmeat crisis | year = 1996 | publisher = Mahale Wildlife Conservation Society | journal = Pan Africa News | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–6 | url = http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/143344/1/Pan3%282%29_01.2.pdf | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the exception of a 1995 report from Cameroon, where gorillas were considered a target species for hunters, Central and West African hunters do not appear to target them.&lt;ref name="ApeAlliance1998"&gt;{{cite book | title = The African bushmeat trade: a recipe for extinction | publisher = Ape Alliance | year = 1998 | url = http://www.insituwildlifeconservation.org/bushmeat.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, poachers have favored hunting chimpanzees because they flee when one is shot.  Gorillas, however, only became easy targets when [[Shotgun shell#Buckshot|buckshot ammunition]] became available, allowing the hunters to more easily kill the dominant male [[silverback]] whose role it is to defend his troop.&lt;ref name="PanAfricaNews1996"/&gt;

Generally, great apes constitute a minor portion of the bushmeat trade.  Although a 1996 study indicated that approximately 1.94% of animal carcasses sold and consumed in [[Brazzaville]] in the [[Republic of the Congo]] belonged to great apes, it accounted for 2.23% of the [[biomass]] of the meat sold, which is significant for ape populations relative to their ecosystem. Furthermore, these numbers may not have accurately represented the extent of the problem for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="ApeAlliance1998"/&gt;
# Vendors may not have admitted the sale of great ape meat because it is illegal;
# The carcasses are large, and may therefore have been consumed locally rather than been transported to large markets;
# Great ape hunting usually peaks when new forest areas are made accessible as they are unwary when unfamiliar with humans, but later hunting declines;
# It is nearly impossible to visually distinguish the meat source when it has been smoked;
# Secondary effects, such as unintended deaths from traps, are not represented in market data.

During the time interval between a study from 1981 to 1983 and another study between 1998–2002 in [[Gabon]], ape population density fell 56%, despite the country retaining nearly 80% of its original forest cover.&lt;ref name="Nature2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Walsh, P.

'''''Cheryl Cole's Night In''''' was a one-off [[television special]], starring English recording artist [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl Cole]], produced for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], that aired on 12 December 2009 at 6:30 pm. The programme was hosted by [[Holly Willoughby]], featured a host of other performers and acted as a lead-in to the final of the [[The X Factor (UK series 6)|sixth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', in which Cole is a judge. Cole performed songs from her debut solo album, ''[[3 Words]]'', and the programme also featured performances from other musical acts as well as interviews conducted by Willoughby. The programme received mixed reviews from critics and was watched by 5 million people; this is substantially less than the viewing figures of other programmes airing at the same time.

==Production==
Tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' published a report on 21 November 2009 claiming that Cole would receive [[Pound sterling|£]]100,000 for appearing in a programme entitled ''Cheryl Cole's Night In''; ITV confirmed the programme two days later, with Cole saying that she would be "working with some of [her] favourite artists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rebecca|last=Routledge|title=Cheryl Cole 'given her own TV show'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a187953/cheryl-cole-given-her-own-tv-show.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=21 November 2009|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="danfrench"&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=French|title=ITV1 confirms Cheryl Cole special|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a188159/itv1-confirms-cheryl-cole-special.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was recorded through the week beginning 7 December at the [[BBC Television Centre]] and images of Cole performing the song "[[Fight for This Love]]", whilst dressed as a [[ninja]], were released.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sophie|last=Freeman|title=Cheryl Cole prepares for Saturday's X Factor fight with ninja routine on TV special|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1234671/Cheryl-Cole-prepares-Saturdays-X-Factor-fight-Ninja-routine-TV-special.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=10 December 2009|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Claire|last=O’Boyle|title=Why do we all love Cheryl Cole - our Woman Of The Year?|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/12/17/why-do-we-all-love-cheryl-cole-our-woman-of-the-year-115875-21902701/|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole also debuted a song from her album, ''3 Words'', titled "[[Parachute (Cheryl Cole song)|Parachute]]", where she danced with [[Derek Hough]], a professional champion of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheryl Cole shows off her glamorous new look as a sexy señorita in TV special|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1235142/Cheryl-Cole-shows-glamorous-new-look-sexy-senorita-TV-special.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=12 December 2009|accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Anna Pickard of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the programme as "an hour of commissioning genius", despite Stuart Heritage of the same publication arguing that "just the title is enough to put you off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anna|last=Pickard|title=The X Factor liveblog - the final shows!|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/dec/11/x-factor-final-live|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 December 2009|accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stuart|last=Heritage|title=Cheryl Cole's Night In?

Holmes also claimed that viewers "were suffering from Chezza overload" due to her appearances on ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' the same weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rachel|last=Holmes|title=Chanel's secret club of 'friends'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/17/chanel-secret-club-of-friends|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme attracted 5 million viewers, a 22% share of the viewing audience, on its first airing. However, an episode of ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' and an installment of the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 7)|seventh series]] of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', which aired at the same time on [[BBC One]], attracted 5.2 million (25% of the audience) and 8.1 million (33%) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Tryhorn|title=TV ratings: More than 12m see Stacey eliminated from The X Factor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/dec/14/tv-ratings-stacey-x-factor|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 December 2009|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3493">'''Cough [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]]''' is the subject of a hoax email that began circulating in 1999.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is described as a "resuscitation technique" in which through prolonged [[cough]]ing and deep breathing every 2 seconds, a person suffering a [[cardiac dysrhythmia]] immediately before [[cardiac arrest]] can keep conscious until help arrives (or until the person can get to the nearest hospital). Neither the [[American Heart Association]] nor the [[American Red Cross]] endorses cough CPR during a heart attack.{{ref|1}}

This confusion appears to revolve primarily over the public's failure to discriminate between a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[cardiac arrest]] and cardiac dysrhythmias. A heart attack occurs when an occlusion (e.g. blood clot) of an artery in the heart slowly causes tissue to die. This can result in chest pain and discomfort, and requires immediate medical attention to resolve the occlusion by emergency surgery or [[Thrombolysis|cardiac clot-busting drugs]]. A cardiac dysrhythmia is primarily an electrical problem within the heart, and is sometimes treated with electrolytes, vagal maneuver, or electrical cardioversion.  Many dysrhythmias may herald an impending heart attack.{{Medical citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Chain E-mails==
Cough CPR has been the subject of a series of [[chain email]] campaigns. These emails are typically of the following format:{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  (See Snopes for this and other citation issues.) [http://www.snopes.com/medical/homecure/coughcpr.asp]
{{quotebox|''HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE''

''Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this article seemed in order. Without help the person whose heart stops beating properly and who begins to feel Faint, has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating.

'''Credit card kiting''' refers to the use of one or more [[credit card]]s to obtain cash and purchasing power they do not have, or pay [[credit card]] balances with the proceeds of other cards. Unlike [[check kiting]], which is illegal under nearly all circumstances, laws against credit card kiting are not completely prohibitive of the practice, thereby allowing it to be done to some degree. It is up to the banks to detect the practice and when necessary, stop it.

In order for prosecution to occur in a credit card kiting scheme, a bank must prove intent to deceive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=West's federal reporter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oXQ1AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Credit+card+kiting%22&amp;dq=%22Credit+card+kiting%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RBjdTsPaDeX30gH9yOSFDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ|year=1996|publisher=West Publishing Company, West Group  0 Reviews West Pub. Co.,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Et seq. reference infers paying credit card minimum balances with [[credit card]] proceeds is [[de facto]] evidence of deceit.

==Methods==
===Introductory rates===
Many credit cards offer [[introductory rate]]s, which in some cases, could be as low as 0% to which balances from other cards can be transferred. In theory, this enables the endless transfer of balances between cards, and since so many offers are available, this could be carried out for a long period of time. But many banks now have become aware of this practice, and introductory rates are offered only a limited number of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumercreditcardguide.com/credit-card-blogs/credit-card-kiting|title=What is "Credit Card Kiting"?|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022301/http://www.consumercreditcardguide.com/credit-card-blogs/credit-card-kiting|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the kiter is delaying legally due balances, and potentially, interest payable to the [[credit card]] bank.

===Cash advances===
[[Cash advance]]s can be obtained from most credit cards, which can be used to pay off balances or loans. Though there are fees and higher interest rates for obtaining these loans, if a card has a high [[credit limit]] or no limit at all, this in theory could be used to pay off the previous balance while adding to the interest. In this case, the kiter is delaying legally due balances, and potentially, interest payable to the [[credit card]] bank; or, in the cited extreme case, using the [[credit card]] proceeds to earn interest at both banks' expense.

===Self payment===
Many payment services, such as [[PayPal]] and [[Square (application)|Square]], allow people to receive credit card payments for low prices, which could be made to oneself. These could be used to pay off balances. In this case, the kiter is creating cash while avoiding legally entitled [[cash advance]] fees. This is a violation of PayPal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/ua-outside|title=Legal Agreements for PayPal Services|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Square&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://squareup.com/legal/ua|title=square User Agreements|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terms of Service]] contracts and agreements.

He enlisted as an aviation cadet at [[Des Moines#Points of interest|Fort Des Moines]] on January 16, 1942. He trained at [[Visalia Municipal Airport|Visalia]], [[Lemoore]] and [[Victorville Army Airfield|Victorville]] Fields in [[California]], receiving his pilot's wings and commission as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in August 1942.&lt;ref name="usaflindsey"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/MOH-bios/Lindsey.html |title=Captain Darrell Robins Lindsey |publisher=Air Force historical studies office |accessdate=July 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041017095133/https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/MOH-bios/Lindsey.html |archivedate=October 17, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsey was also trained as a [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] at [[Kirtland Air Force Base|Kirtland Field]], [[New Mexico]], and in 1943 was assigned to the 314th Bomb Squadron at [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Field]], [[Florida]], with the rank of [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]]. He was transferred to [[Battle Creek, Michigan#Transportation|Kellogg Field]], Michigan, in September 1943, and assigned to the 585th Bomb Squadron, 394th Bomb Group (Medium), a [[B-26 Marauder]] outfit. Promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in December, he was assigned as a flight commander.

As part of the [[List of units using the B-26 Marauder during World War II#Ninth Air Force|Ninth Air Force]] the 394th Bomb Group was deployed to [[RAF Boreham]], [[England]], on March 11, 1944, and immediately participated in the bombing of bridges, airfields and the rail system in France in preparation for the [[Operation Overlord|cross-channel invasion]]. On [[D-Day]], the group attacked gun positions in [[Cherbourg]], then continued to support Allied ground units in Normandy by attacking German [[lines of communication]]. In late July, the group changed bases to [[RAF Holmsley South]] in preparation for a move to the continent, and on August 7, 1944, began a three-day campaign against rail and bridge targets in the [[Île-de-France|Île-de-France region]] of northern France for which the group as a whole received a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]].&lt;ref name="394BG"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.uakron.edu/ul/archives/b26/bg-394th.html |title=394th Bomb Group history |publisher=University of Akron |accessdate=July 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519210516/http://www3.uakron.edu/ul/archives/b26/bg-394th.html |archivedate=May 19, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medalofhonor-lindsey.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Memorial at the [[Lindsey Air Station]], [[Wiesbaden]] before 1993]]

On August 9, Captain Lindsey, a veteran of 45 combat missions, flew as group leader to destroy the railroad bridge over the [[Seine River]] at [[Arrondissement of Pontoise|L'Isle Adam]] northwest of [[Paris]]. The bridge, one of the last over the Seine still standing, was heavily defended by German [[anti-aircraft]] units.

Leading a formation of 30 aircraft, Lindsey's B-26 was heavily damaged and both the right engine and wing set afire during the bombing run. Although knocked out of formation, Lindsey recovered his place and led the group over the target, then stabilized the aircraft so that his crew could parachute. According to the crew's bombardier, Lindsey severely lessened his own chance to escape to prevent the aircraft from spinning, which proved fatal when a fuel tank exploded just after the last crewman exited the aircraft. Captain Lindsey's body was not recovered and he was listed as [[missing-in-action]] and presumed killed.

On May 30, 1945, Lindsey was awarded the Medal of Honor, accepted by his widow, Evalyn Scott Lindsey Rhinehart (1919–1992) during an August 9, 1945, ceremony at First Presbyterian Church in Fort Dodge. In November 1946, [[Lindsey Air Station]], [[Wiesbaden Air Base]], Germany, was named in his memory and served as the location of the Headquarters for the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]]. The station closed in 1993 and a red [[granite]] [[monument]] there was returned to Jefferson, Iowa, and placed on the lawn of the [[Greene County Courthouse (Iowa)|Greene County Courthouse]], where it was dedicated to Lindsey on June 12, 1993.&lt;ref name="gcimemorial"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.jeffersoniowa.com/content_display.php?contentId=16&amp;sectionId=59 |title = Points of Interest-Lindsey Memorial |publisher =  Jefferson Area Chamber of Commerce |accessdate = July 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following day at Lindsey's ''alma mater'', [[Buena Vista University]], another memorial was dedicated to Lindsey and [[Ralph Neppel]], also a recipient of the Medal of Honor who had attended Buena Vista. The memorial was donated by Judge Charles Pendleton, a BVU alumnus. Judge Pendleton had earlier made a donation in the memory of Evalyn Rhinehart, who had recently died (August 17, 1992) in a motor vehicle accident, and the wife of a fellow alumnus, Dr. Bruce L. Rhinehart (1922–2010). Pendleton learned that she had been the widow of Darrell Lindsey, and that Lindsey's monument was being returned from Germany. Together, Pendleton and Rhinehart also began the '''Lindsey-Neppel Scholarship''' at Buena Vista in 1993.&lt;ref name="bvumemorial"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bvu.edu/departments/instadvancement/advancement/publications/bvtoday/winter2000/champagne.html |title=Champagne Charlie Pilots BVU scholarship |publisher=Buena Vista Today Winter 2000 |accessdate=July 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905124252/http://www.bvu.edu/departments/instadvancement/advancement/publications/bvtoday/winter2000/champagne.html |archivedate=September 5, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medal of Honor citation==
&lt;blockquote&gt;On August 9, 1944, Capt. Lindsey led a formation of 30 B-26 medium bombers in a hazardous mission to destroy the strategic enemy held L'Isle Adam railroad bridge over the Seine in [[Vichy France|occupied France]]. With most of the bridges over the Seine destroyed, the heavily fortified L'Isle Adam bridge was of inestimable value to the enemy in moving troops, supplies, and equipment to Paris. Capt. Lindsey was fully aware of the fierce resistance that would be encountered. Shortly after reaching enemy territory the formation was buffeted with heavy and accurate antiaircraft fire. By skillful evasive action, Capt. Lindsey was able to elude much of the enemy flak, but just before entering the bombing run his B-26 was peppered with holes. During the bombing run the enemy fire was even more intense, and Capt. Lindsey's right engine received a direct hit and burst into flames. Despite the fact that his ship was hurled out of formation by the violence of the concussion, Capt. Lindsey brilliantly maneuvered back into the lead position without disrupting the flight. Fully aware that the gasoline tanks might explode at any moment, Capt. Lindsey gallantly elected to continue the perilous bombing run. With fire streaming from his right engine and his right wing half enveloped in flames, he led his formation over the target upon which the bombs were dropped with telling effect. Immediately after the objective was attacked, Capt. Lindsey gave the order for the crew to parachute from the doomed aircraft. With magnificent coolness and superb piloting, and without regard for his own life, he held the swiftly descending airplane in a steady glide until the members of the crew could jump to safety. With the right wing completely enveloped in flames and an explosion of the gasoline tank imminent, Capt. Lindsey still remained unperturbed. The last man to leave the stricken plane was the [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]], who offered to lower the wheels so that Capt. Lindsey might escape from the nose. Realizing that this might throw the aircraft into an uncontrollable spin and jeopardize the bombardier's chances to escape, Capt. Lindsey refused the offer. Immediately after the bombardier had bailed out, and before Capt. Lindsey was able to follow, the right gasoline tank exploded. The aircraft sheathed in fire, went into a steep dive and was seen to explode as it crashed. All who are living today from this plane owe their lives to the fact that Capt. Lindsey remained cool and showed supreme courage in this emergency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Design Commons''' is a deconstructed conference founded by the CEO of Interactive Africa, [[Ravi Naidoo]] in collaboration with World Design Weeks founder [[Kari Korkman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.helsinkidesignweek.com/events/design-commons/|title=DesignCommons|work=Helsinki Design Week|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was established in 2017 and acts as a travelling discussion platform on the future of cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/08/09/design-commons-event-helskini-aims-find-solutions-to-world-issues/|title=DesignCommons event in Helsinki aims to find solutions to world issues|date=2017-08-09|work=Dezeen|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the conventional conference format, Design Commons places stakeholders in urban planning and public space at the same table as notable designers to foster a sense of common ground and find solutions to some of the world's pressing issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.helsinkidesignweek.com/series/ground-breaking-design-conference-to-be-launched-at-helsinki-design-week/|title=Ground-breaking design conference to be launched at Helsinki Design Week - Helsinki Design Week|date=2017-06-07|work=Helsinki Design Week|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The first Design Commons event took place in [[Clarion Congress Centre]], [[Helsinki]] as part of the [[World Design Weeks]] summit from 14 to 15 September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designcommons.info/|title=DesignCommons - Helsinki|website=designcommons.info|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndpculture.org/news/design-commons-at-helsinki-design-week|title=Northern Dimension Partnership on Culture|website=www.ndpculture.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable speakers include architect [[David Adjaye]], Dutch architect [[Winy Maas]], Finnish technology entrepreneur Marko Ahtisaari, Dutch landscape architect [[Cees van der Veeken]] and [[Studio Swine]], a collaboration between Japanese architect [[Azusa Murakami]] and British artist [[Alexander Groves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.designindaba.com/articles/creative-work/design-commons-new-kind-bespoke-global-portable-conference|title=Design Commons is a new kind of bespoke, global, portable conference {{!}} Design Indaba|work=Design Indaba|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dhammayietra''' ({{lang-km|ធម្មយាត្រា}}, "pilgrimage") is an annual peace walk in [[Cambodia]] that originated during the historic repatriation of refugees along the [[Thailand|Thai]] border camps during the [[United Nations]] monitored transition to [[UNTAC|democracy in 1992]].  The Khmer word "dhammayietra", derived from [[Pāli]], ''dhamma'' ([[dharma]]) and [[Sanskrit]] ''yātrā'' ("a walk", "procession"), means "pilgrimage" but is often translated as "pilgrimage of truth". The peace walk takes place in early May and usually involves an assemblage of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks and lay persons who travel various routes in Cambodia.&lt;ref name=PPP97&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Tricia|title=Dhammayietra|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/dhammayietra|accessdate=26 October 2015|work=Phnom Penh Post|date=4 April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assemblage is often greeted by villagers along the route who expect a blessing (''teuk mon'' {{lang-km|ទឹកមន្ត}} or blessing with [[Holy water#Other religions|lustral water]]).  The founder of the Dhammayietra was [[Maha Ghosananda]] ({{lang-km|សម្តេចព្រះមហាឃោសានន្ទ}}), a Buddhist monk who ranked among the higher echelons of the Cambodian [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]; he led the first Dhammayietra as he returned from exile following the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kathryn |last=Poethig |title=Movable Peace: Engaging the Transnational in Cambodia's Dhammayietra |journal=[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] |year=2002 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=19–28 |doi=10.1111/1468-5906.00097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Dhammayietra consisted of almost 500 Cambodian Buddhist monks, nuns and precept-taking lay people. They were joined by [[Peace walk#The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life|The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life.]] Together the two groups crossed Cambodia from the Thai border all the way to Vietnam, spending several days walking through Khmer Rouge controlled territory along the way.

The 1997 Dhammayietra marched from [[Battambang Province|Battambang]] to [[Pailin Province|Pailin]], which was at the time controlled by the [[Khmer Rouge]], and on to [[Banteay Chhmar]] in [[Banteay Meanchey Province]]. The Khmer Rouge banned monks from their territory in Pailin and prohibited the open practice of religion until 1996 when the majority of Khmer Rouge distanced themselves from [[Pol Pot]] and declared [[Ieng Sary]] their new leader. After this mass defection, monks were tolerated in the area. The 1994 Dhammayietra, which also aimed to march through Pailin failed to reach its destination due to heavy fighting in the province. In Pailin, Ghosananda briefly met with Ieng Sary who respectfully received a blessing but did not attend the official ceremonies. The march, which took place just months before the [[1997 Cambodian Coup]], was unexpectedly joined in Pailin, for 15 kilometers, by [[Sam Rainsy]] and his numerous bodyguards. Rainsy used the opportunity to criticize the absence of the two [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Ministers]], [[Hun Sen]] and Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]], who unbeknownst at the time, were embroiled in tensions that would soon erupt into armed fighting between the two and their supporters for control of the government.&lt;ref name=PPP97 /&gt;

'''Dubrava Prison massacre''' is the war time killing of at least 99 [[Kosovo]] [[Albanians|Albanian]] prisoners and the wounding of around 200 prisoners in the Dubrava Prison, in north-western Kosovo between the dates of 22–24 May 1999.

Targeting Yugoslav and Serb forces nearby NATO bombed the prison on May 19 and May 21, 1999. On May 22, Serbian security forces lined up the approximately 1,000 prisoners in the courtyard and fired on them with snipers, machine guns, and grenades from the prison walls and guard towers, killing at least seventy people. At least another twelve prisoners were killed over the next twenty-four hours as prison guards, special police, and possibly paramilitaries attacked prisoners who were hiding in the prison's destroyed buildings, basements, and sewers. The injured were taken away in trucks, while the remaining prisoners were transported to Lipjan prison, where they were beaten. On June 10, they were transferred and held in prisons in Serbia after the war had ended.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/Under_Orders_En_Combined.pdf | title=Under Orders: War Crimes in Kosovo | publisher=Human Rights Watch | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistency of witness testimony, with specific details about times and locations, leaves no doubt that Serbian and possibly Yugoslav government forces deliberately and without need killed a substantial number of ethnic Albanians in the prison.&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;

==Background==

Dubrava prison was Kosovo's largest detention facility. Located a few miles east of [[Istok]] in north-western Kosovo ([[Metohija]] region), near the frontier with Montenegro, the prison had three pavilions with a capacity of more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates were suspected KLA and common criminals.&lt;ref name="Hagan2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=John Hagan |title=Justice in the Balkans: Prosecuting War Crimes in the Hague Tribunal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTqRvd3Ta_cC&amp;pg=PA217 |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31230-9 |pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all of Kosovo's detention facilities, credible reports of torture and abuse emanated from Dubrava prison throughout 1998 and early 1999.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

Defense lawyers reported restricted access to their clients in Dubrava, and the [[Kosovo Verification Mission]] was never allowed access to the prison.{{sfn|HRW|2001}} There were many complaints of torture and beatings from people held in this prison. Injuries ranged from broken bones to permanent kidney failure. It is believed that at least four or five men died as a result of beatings sustained while they were detained at the prison between October 1998 and March 1999.&lt;ref name="OSCE"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/17774 |title=Kosovo/Kosova As Seen, As Told |publisher=Organization for Security Co-operation in Europe |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A witness told HRW prison guards beat the prisoners every day once the NATO bombing began.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

One former prisoner transferred to Dubrava on April 30, said that approximately 165 ethnic Albanians from [[Gjakova]] were brought to Dubrava a short time after he had arrived. This was confirmed during the April–May 2000 trial in [[Niš]] of 143 Albanians arrested in Gjakova in May 1999, who testified that they had been transferred from Gjakova to prisons in [[Peć]], [[Lipljan]], and Dubrava.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

Among the ethnic Albanians in Dubrava was one of Kosovo's most prominent political prisoners, [[Ukshin Hoti]], who was finishing the last year of a five-year sentence. Three witnesses said that Hoti was released from Dubrava on 16 May because his sentence expired. His current whereabouts, however, are unknown, and many former prisoners and human rights activists fear that he is dead.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

Witnesses before [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) have testified that Yugoslav army tanks and anti-aircraft cannons had been placed round the jail, which in April were hit by NATO aircraft.&lt;ref name="IWPR"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/analysis-dubrava-jail-deaths-dispute |title=Analysis: Dubrava Jail Deaths Dispute |date=2002-08-31 |agency=Institute for War and Peace Reporting |accessdate=2013-04-10 |author=Klarin, Mirko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some former prisoners claim that they saw anti-aircraft fire coming from near the prison during the NATO bombing.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

==NATO bombings==

NATO bombed what it claimed to be Yugoslav Army and Serbian police forces near the prison at 1:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 19 May killing four and wounding two civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWGFAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Human Rights Watch|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners spent the next two nights sleeping outside, but within the walls of the prison. On 21 May, prison guards ordered the prisoners to line up in the courtyard, however, the process was interrupted when NATO planes flew over.{{sfn|HRW|2001}} Initially, the NATO claimed that the prison was a military barracks.&lt;ref name="Hagan2010"/&gt;

The next day, [[Tanjug]] (state news agency for [[FR Yugoslavia]]) reported 19 prisoners and guards killed and more than ten wounded.{{sfn|HRW|2001}} The victims of the bombings, at least 23, were KLA members.&lt;ref name="LeurdijkZandee2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dick A. Leurdijk|author2=Dick Zandee|title=Kosovo: from crisis to crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJZpAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-1554-5|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav government claimed 85 civilian deaths, while HRW determined ca. 18 deaths.&lt;ref name="AertsenArsovska2013"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Ivo Aertsen |editor2=Jana Arsovska |editor3=Holger-C Rohne |editor4=Marta Valiñas |editor5=Kris Vanspauwen |title=Restoring Justice after Large-scale Violent Conflicts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKeYVjnJwmUC&amp;pg=PA94 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-00630-4 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source stated that 95 were killed and 196 injured.&lt;ref name="ŠkariḱMihajlovska2002"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Svetomir Škariḱ |author2=Nadica Mihajlovska |title=Law, force, and peace - Macedonia and Kosovo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EE9tAAAAMAAJ |year=2002 |publisher=Tri D |isbn=978-9989-677-03-8 |quote=On 19 and 21 May 1999, the prison Dubrava in Istok, near Pec was bombed, killing 95 and injuring 196 persons.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executions==
Inmates were [[extrajudicially killed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWGFAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Human Rights Watch|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[summary executed]]&lt;ref name="Defence2000"/&gt; on 22 and 23 May.

Witnesses before ICTY stated that on the early morning of 22 May 1999 the prisoners were told to line up on the sports field, with the explanation that they were to be transferred to other more secure prisons. About 800 prisoners obeyed while the rest hid themselves in the jail. After the prisoners formed a line, police started firing from the guard tower and the jail walls, using hand grenades, bazookas and automatic weapons.&lt;ref name="IWPR" /&gt;  The witnesses said about 20 officers opened fire. What ensued was total chaos with prisoners falling down all over the place. Witness testimony with details of times and locations indicates that government forces executed a substantial number of ethnic Albanians in the prison.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

Other witnesses testified that on the fateful day prison officials ordered the approximately 1,000 prisoners to line up in the prison yard. After a few minutes, they were fired upon from the prison walls and guard towers with machine guns and grenades, killing at least seventy people.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt; Another number is 67.&lt;ref name="Defence2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain. Ministry of Defence|title=Kosovo: Lessons from the Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKdPAQAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Stationery Office|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next twenty-four hours, prison guards, special police, and possibly paramilitaries attacked prisoners who were hiding in the prison's buildings, basements, and sewers, killing at least another twelve inmates.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

In 2011 the [[Republic of Kosovo]] [[Parliament of Kosovo|Member of Parliament]] and witness to the massacre Nait Hasani stated:

{{quote|... we were called to this place, surrounded by a crowd of guards - and then the hunting started ... they fired from three sides with grenades and machine guns ... you saw nothing than flames, fire and blood ....}}

A witness told [[Human Rights Watch]]:

{{quote| They put us in a line. Around 6:10 a.m., they said we have ten minutes to get in a line. The line was not clean, but had four to six people in a line, about 200 meters long. After a few seconds, we were twenty to twenty-five meters from the walls, they threw some three or four hand grenades. At the same time, they began shooting with RPGs [rocket propelled grenades], and snipers [sniper rifles]. Whoever could manage just fell to the ground.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}}}

Another recalled:

{{quote|We were made to stand in a line on a cement football field surrounded by guard towers. About 100 people were in one line. We stood there about ten minutes until we were all in a line. Then a guy named "Ace" climbed up one of the towers and gave the order to shoot. We saw that. It was something like twenty minutes of constant shooting from the five meter-high walls—it was all prepared. They had hand-held RPGs, sniper rifles, machine guns, AK47s, hand grenades, and mortars. They were shooting from the walls. The bombs fell on everyone and people were flying.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}}}

Chaos ensued as prisoners ran for cover in the various buildings of the prison, their basements, or the prison's sewer system.{{sfn|HRW|2001}} That evening, all of the witnesses say, a group of special police or paramilitaries entered the prison and tried to reassert control. The assault lasted approximately twenty minutes, during which time hand grenades were thrown into the school building, allegedly killing at least two people. The prisoners remained hidden during the night, some of them preparing to defend themselves with makeshift weapons made from broken furniture or garden tools.{{sfn|HRW|2001}} The wounded numbering about 120 to 150 were placed in the Pavilion C basement. The following morning of May 23, the witnesses said, new soldiers or paramilitary units came to the jail, opened the drains and threw in hand grenades.&lt;ref name="IWPR" /&gt; That day four people went crazy and hanged themselves in their cells.&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;

A witness told Human Rights Watch:

{{quote|Then the forces saw us and surrounded us. I saw them come with machine guns and big knives and they hit the twenty-eight guys in the basement. People's organs were spilling out everywhere.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}}}

Later in the morning, the security forces had reasserted some control over the prison, and they issued an ultimatum for the prisoners to emerge from their hiding places within fifteen minutes. With no other options, the prisoners revealed themselves, and were then gathered in the prison's sports hall, which was still undamaged. According to the witnesses, [[Yugoslav Army]] soldiers were present this time.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

The injured were taken away in trucks, while the remaining prisoners were transported in approximately ten buses to Lipljan prison in south-central Kosovo. All of the former prisoners claimed to have been beaten in Lipjan.{{sfn|HRW|2001}} All of the ethnic Albanian prisoners in Lipljan were transferred to prisons in [[Central Serbia]].{{when|date=October 2015}} The Yugoslav government claimed NATO bombs had killed 95 inmates and injured 196.{{when|date=October 2015}}{{sfn|HRW|2001}} As the prisoners got on buses, the police counted those missing. It came to 154, witnesses stated.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stench of Horror Lingers in a Prison in Kosovo |work=The New York Times |date=1999-11-08 |author=Gall, Carlota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacky Rowland, a BBC journalist who was escorted by the Yugoslav government to the prison,{{when|date=October 2015}} testified before the ICTY seeing a prison room in with about 25 bodies piled up in one place. In addition to the fact that there was no visible damage from bombing in that room, Rowland was "especially disturbed" by the fact that the corpses had their trousers pulled down to the ankles, so that their underwear was visible, ruling out death due to blast effect.&lt;ref name="IWPR" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Since all of the survivors of the massacre were transferred to prisons in Central Serbia after the attack, accounts of the killings did not emerge until after the war when some of the prisoners were released.{{sfn|HRW|2001}} In June 1999, Spanish [[NATO]] troops discovered one body in the prison, who had been lying there at least one month, his throat was cut.&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;

On 13 August, a Spanish forensic team began exhuming 97 graves that were found near Dubrava prison. A legal advisor to the ICTY, Karl Koenig, stated that the bodies appeared to have been there since 26 or 27 May.  In her 10 November 1999 report to the U.N. Security Council, ICTY chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said that 97 bodies had been found at the Rakosh site.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

A New York Times reporter who visited the prison in November 1999 witnessed: "basements of the buildings, the blood lies still sticky on the floor, bullet holes scar the walls, and impact marks of grenade explosions crater the floors.".&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;

==Perpetrators==
The Serbian police in Istok were under the jurisdiction of the Secretariat of Internal Affairs (SUP) in Peć, which covered the municipalities of Peć, Klina, and Istok. The commander of the Peć SUP during the war was Col. Boro Vlahović.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

Journalist Paul Watson, who visited Dubrava on 19 May and 21 May quoted one official from the prison, Aleksandar Rakočević, whom he identified as a warden.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

Two former prisoners who spoke with Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that the director of the prison was known as "Miki", a dark-skinned man who spoke perfect Albanian. According to a witness, the deputy director was known as "Ace" and he was the one who allegedly gave the order to fire on the assembled prisoners on May 22.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

Albanian prisoners that spoke to HRW claimed that the prison guards had released and armed some of the ethnic Serbian prisoners after the first NATO raid on May 19. Both witnesses said they saw some of these people back in the prison attacking the Albanians with whom they had, until recently, been incarcerated.{{sfn|HRW|2001}}

Another former Dubrava prisoner, Kosovo MP Ukë Thaçi, is convinced that the Dubrava killings were an ''"organized massacre through prison staff, police and army ... it was a Serbian state planning ..., because Serbian police and army were located within the prison facilities."''&lt;ref name="Technorati"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://technorati.com/politics/article/kosovo-remembers-dubrava-prison-massacre/ |title=Kosovo Remembers Dubrava Prison Massacre |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2013-04-10 |author=Sofaliu, Korrik |location=Prishtina |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525072826/http://technorati.com/politics/article/kosovo-remembers-dubrava-prison-massacre/ |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the Peć SUP, which after the war had been moved to Serbia, compiled a report on the killing of prisoners in the Dubrava prison three years after the event, was interpreted by the ICTY prosecutor as having the purpose to help the defense of Slobodan Milošević.&lt;ref name="Sense"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/investigation-or-%E2%80%9Ccover-up.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=9101 |title=Investigation or "Cover Up" |date=2005-05-09 |agency=Sense Agency |accessdate=2013-04-10 |location=The Hague}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ely Eel Day''' is an annual celebration observed by people from [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], [[Cambridgeshire]] to celebrate the city's namesake &amp;mdash; the eel. The celebrations start with a parade which begins from Cross Green outside [[Ely Cathedral]] and proceeds through the city to the Jubilee Gardens, passing by the Market Square and along the River Great Ouse at Ely's Waterside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ely People - Eel Day Festival 2011 |url=http://www.elypeople.co.uk/groups/local-events/Ely-rsquo-s-Eel-Festival-Big-Hit/story-11078170-detail/story.html |publisher=Elypeople.co.uk |accessdate=2014-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020123121/http://www.elypeople.co.uk/groups/local-events/Ely-rsquo-s-Eel-Festival-Big-Hit/story-11078170-detail/story.html |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebrations following the parade include an eel throwing competition. The competition does not use real eels. Originally competitors were given socks rolled into some tights with rice in the end to weight it down&lt;ref name='presspack'&gt;{{cite news | first=Oscar | last=Haines | coauthors= | title=I defended my eel-throwing title!|date=2007-04-29|publisher=BBC|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6600000/newsid_6605400/6605443.stm | work =[[Newsround|Newsround Online]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-05-01 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but now the competition uses specially made toy eels.

{{Politics of Japan}}

The '''Emperor of Japan''' is the head of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial Family]] and the [[head of state]] of [[Japan]]. Under the [[Constitution of Japan|1947 constitution]], he is defined as "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people." Historically, he was also the highest authority of the [[Shinto]] religion. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the Emperor is called {{Nihongo||天皇|'''Tennō'''}}, literally "heavenly sovereign".

The role of the Emperor of Japan has historically alternated between a largely ceremonial symbolic role and that of an actual imperial ruler. Since the establishment of the first [[shogunate]] in 1199, the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander, unlike many Western [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchs]]. Japanese Emperors have nearly always been controlled by external political forces, to varying degrees. In fact, between 1192 and 1867, the ''[[shōgun]]s'', or their ''[[shikken]]'' regents in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] (1203–1333), were the ''de facto'' rulers of Japan, although they were nominally appointed by the Emperor. After the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1867, the Emperor was the embodiment of all sovereign power in the realm, as enshrined in the [[Meiji Constitution]] of 1889. Since the enactment of the 1947 Constitution, he has been a ceremonial head of state without even nominal political powers.

Since the mid-nineteenth century, the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] has been called ''Kyūjō'' ({{lang|ja|宮城}}), later ''Kōkyo'' ({{lang|ja|皇居}}), and is on the former site of [[Edo Castle]] in the heart of [[Tokyo]] (the current capital of Japan). Earlier, Emperors resided in [[Kyoto]] (the ancient capital) for nearly eleven centuries. [[The Emperor's Birthday]] (currently December 23) is a national holiday.

==Role==
Unlike most constitutional monarchs, the Emperor is not even the ''nominal'' chief executive. [[wikisource:Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER V. THE CABINET|Article 65]] explicitly vests executive power in the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]], of which the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] is the leader. The Emperor is also not the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]. The Japan Self-Defense Forces Act of 1954 also explicitly vests this role with the Prime Minister.

The Emperor's powers are limited only to important ceremonial functions. [[wikisource:Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER I. THE EMPEROR|Article 4]] of the Constitution stipulates that the Emperor "shall perform only such acts in matters of state as are provided for in the Constitution and he shall not have powers related to government." It also stipulates that "the advice and approval of the Cabinet shall be required for all acts of the Emperor in matters of state" (Article 3). Article 4 also states that these duties can be delegated by the Emperor as provided for by law.

While the Emperor formally [[Imperial Investiture|appoints]] the Prime Minister to office, Article 6 of the Constitution requires him to appoint the candidate "as designated by the [[National Diet|Diet]]", without giving the Emperor the right to decline appointment.

[[wikisource:Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER I. THE EMPEROR|Article 6]] of the [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution]] delegates the Emperor the following ceremonial roles:
#Appointment of the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet.
#Appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as designated by the Cabinet.

The Emperor's other duties are laid down in article 7 of the Constitution, where it is stated that "the Emperor, with the advice and approval of the Cabinet, shall perform the following acts in matters of state on behalf of the people." In practice, all of these duties are exercised only in accordance with the binding instructions of the Cabinet:
#Promulgation of amendments of the constitution, laws, cabinet orders, and treaties.
#Convocation of the Diet.
#Dissolution of the House of Representatives.
#Proclamation of general election of members of the Diet.
#Attestation of the appointment and dismissal of Ministers of State and other officials as provided for by law, and of full powers and credentials of Ambassadors and Ministers.
#Attestation of general and special amnesty, commutation of punishment, reprieve, and restoration of rights.
#Awarding of honors.
#Attestation of instruments of ratification and other diplomatic documents as provided for by law.
#Receiving foreign ambassadors and ministers.
#Performance of ceremonial functions.

Regular ceremonies of the Emperor with a constitutional basis are the [[Imperial Investiture]]s ''(Shinninshiki)'' in the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]] and the [[Speech from the Throne]] ceremony in the [[House of Councillors]] in the [[National Diet Building]]. The latter ceremony opens ordinary and extra sessions of the Diet. Ordinary sessions are opened each January and also after new elections to the House of Representatives. Extra sessions usually convene in the autumn and are opened then.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVYP66nRSO8 The formal investiture of the Prime Minister in 2010], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBcygK0uQ7E the opening of the ordinary session of the Diet in January 2012] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEkWcXFZz2c the opening of an extra session of the Diet in the autumn of 2011.] The 120th anniversary of the Diet was commemorarated with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAY-7gl21i0 a special ceremony] in the House of Councillors in November 2010, when also the Empress and the Prince and Princess Akishino were present.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the Emperor has been a symbol of continuity with the past, the degree of power exercised by the Emperor has varied considerably throughout Japanese history. In the early 7th century, the Emperor had begun to be called the {{nihongo|"[[Son of Heaven]]"|天子|tenshi|or 天子様 ''tenshi-sama''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kO0tUpCViA8C&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=%22son+of+heaven%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22son%20of%20heaven%22&amp;f=false|title=Rethinking Japan: Social Sciences, Ideology and Thought|editor-first=Adriana| editor-last=Boscaro| editor2-first=Franco | editor2-last=Gatti| editor3-first=Massimo | editor3-last=Raveri|publisher=Japan Library Limited|year=2003|isbn=978-0-904404-79-1|page=300|volume=II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
{{See also|List of Emperors of Japan}}

The title of Emperor was borrowed from China, being derived from Chinese characters and was retroactively applied to the legendary Japanese rulers who reigned before the 7th–8th centuries AD.&lt;ref name="Holcombe2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Holcombe|title=The Genesis of East Asia: 221 B.C. – A.D. 907|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XT5pvPZ4vroC&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=January 2001|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2465-5|pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the traditional account of the [[Nihon Shoki]], Japan was founded by [[Emperor Jimmu]] in 660 BC. Modern historians agree that the Emperors before the possible late 3rd century AD ruler known traditionally as [[Emperor Ōjin]] are legendary. [[Emperor Ankō]] of the 5th century AD, traditionally the 20th emperor, is the earliest generally agreed upon historical ruler of all or a part of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Charles F. [http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/kofun.html  "Kofun Culture",] [http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/index.htm Japanese Archaeology.] 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The reign of [[Emperor Kinmei]] ({{circa|509}}&amp;nbsp;– 571 AD), the 29th emperor, is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates;&lt;ref name="Titsingh pp. 34-36"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=nipon%20o%20dai%20itsi%20ran&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 34–36]; Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w4f5FrmIJKIC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=  pp. 261–262; Varley, pp. 123–124].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoye, Timothy. (1999). ''Japanese Politics: Fixed and Floating Worlds,'' p. 78; excerpt, "According to legend, the first Japanese emperor was Jinmu. Along with the next 13 emperors, Jinmu is not considered an actual, historical figure. Historically verifiable Emperors of Japan date from the early sixth century with Kinmei.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of [[Emperor Kanmu]] (737–806), the 50th sovereign of the [[Yamato dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William George Aston|Aston, William]]. (1896). ''Nihongi,''  pp. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological information about the earliest historical rulers of Japan may lie within the ancient tombs known as [[kofun]], constructed between the early 3rd century and the early 7th century AD. However, since the [[Meiji period]], the [[Imperial Household Agency]] has refused to open the kofun to the public nor to archaeologists, citing their desire not to disturb the spirits of the past Emperors. In December 2006, the Imperial Household Agency reversed its position and decided to allow researchers to enter some of the kofun with no restrictions.

===Factional control===
There have been six non-imperial [[Japanese clans|families]] who have controlled Japanese emperors: the [[Soga clan|Soga]] (530s–645), the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] (850s–1070), the [[Taira clan|Taira]] (1159-1180s), the [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] (and [[Kamakura Bakufu|Kamakura bakufu]]) (1192–1333), the [[Ashikaga shogunate|Ashikaga]] (1336–1565), and the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] (1603–1867). However, every shogun from the Minamoto, Ashikaga, and Tokugawa families had to be officially recognized by the Emperors, who were still the source of sovereignty, although they could not exercise their powers independently from the Shogunate.

===Disputes===
The growth of the [[samurai]] class from the 10th century gradually weakened the power of the imperial family over the realm, leading to a time of instability. Emperors have been known to come into conflict with the reigning shogun from time to time. Some instances, such as [[Emperor Go-Toba]]'s [[Jōkyū War|1221 rebellion]] against the [[Kamakura shogunate]] and the 1336 [[Kenmu Restoration]] under [[Emperor Go-Daigo]], show the power struggle between the imperial court and the military governments of Japan.

===Territorial matters===
Until recent centuries, Japan's territory did not include [[List of extreme points of Japan|several remote regions]] of its modern-day territory. The name "[[Names of Japan|Nippon]]" came into use only many centuries after the start of the current imperial line. Centralized government only began to appear shortly before and during the time of [[Prince Shōtoku]] (572–622). The Emperor was more like a revered embodiment of divine harmony than the head of an actual governing administration. In Japan, it has always been easy for ambitious lords to hold actual power, as such positions have not been inherently contradictory to the Emperor's position. The parliamentary government today continues a similar coexistence with the Emperor as have various shoguns, regents, warlords, guardians, etc.

Historically the titles of ''Tennō'' in Japanese have never included territorial designations as is the case with many European monarchs. The position of Emperor is a territory-independent phenomenon—the Emperor is the Emperor, even if he has followers only in one province (as was the case sometimes with the southern and northern courts).

===''Shōguns''===
From 1192 to 1867, sovereignty of the state was exercised by the ''[[shōgun]]s'', or their ''[[shikken]]'' regents (1203–1333), whose authority was conferred by Imperial warrant. When [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers first came into contact with the Japanese (see ''[[Nanban period]]''), they described Japanese conditions in analogy, likening the Emperor with great symbolic authority but little political power, to the [[Pope]], and the ''shōgun'' to secular European rulers (e.g., the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]). In keeping with the analogy, they even used the term "Emperor" in reference to the ''shōguns'' and their regents, e.g. in the case of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], whom missionaries called "Emperor Taico-sama" (from [[Sesshō and Kampaku|Taikō]] and the honorific ''[[Japanese titles|sama]]'').

===Meiji restoration===
{{main article|Meiji Restoration}}

After the [[United States Navy]] [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s [[Black Ships]] forcibly opened Japan to foreign trade, and the shogunate proved incapable of hindering the "barbarian" interlopers, the [[Emperor Kōmei]] began to assert himself politically. By the early 1860s, the relationship between the imperial court and the Shogunate was changing radically. Disaffected [[Han system|domains]] and ''[[rōnin]]'' began to rally to the call of ''[[sonnō jōi]]'' ("revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians"). The domains of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]], historic enemies of the Tokugawa, used this turmoil to unite their forces and won an important military victory outside of [[Kyoto]] against Tokugawa forces.

In 1868, imperial "restoration" was declared, and the Shogunate was dissolved. A new constitution described the Emperor as "the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty", whose rights included to sanction and promulgate laws, to execute them and to exercise "supreme command of the Army and the Navy". The liaison conference created in 1893 also made the Emperor the leader of the [[Imperial General Headquarters]].

===World War II===
The role of the Emperor as head of the [[State Shinto]] religion was exploited during the war, creating an [[Imperial cult]] that led to [[kamikaze]] bombers and other [[Hirohito#Civilian deaths and suicides|fanaticism]]. This in turn led to the requirement in the [[Potsdam Declaration]] for the elimination "for all time [of] the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest". In [[State Shinto]], the Emperor was believed to be a [[Arahitogami]] (a living god). Following Japan's surrender, the Allies issued the [[Shinto Directive]] separating church and state within Japan.

===Current constitution===
The constitution provides for a [[parliamentary system]] of government and guarantees certain fundamental rights. Under its terms, the Emperor of Japan is "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people" and exercises a purely ceremonial role without the possession of sovereignty.

The constitution, also known as the {{nihongo|"[[Constitution of Japan]]"|日本国憲法|Nihonkoku-Kenpō|formerly written 日本國憲法 (same pronunciation)}}, {{nihongo|"Postwar Constitution"|戦後憲法|Sengo-Kenpō}} or the {{nihongo|"Peace Constitution"|平和憲法|Heiwa-Kenpō}}, was drawn up under the [[Allied occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]] that followed World War II and was intended to replace Japan's previous militaristic and quasi-absolute monarchy system with a form of liberal democracy. Currently, it is a rigid document and no subsequent amendment has been made to it since its adoption.

===Relation to Shinto===
In [[Japanese mythology]], according to ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the Emperor and his family are said to be direct descendants of the sun-goddess [[Amaterasu]]. During [[World War II]], the role of the Emperor as head of the [[Shinto]] religion was exploited, which resulted in the creation of [[State Shinto]] and an [[Imperial cult]]. Following the end of the Second World War, the Allies issued the [[Shinto Directive]] which abolished the state support for the Shinto religion, leading to the [[Humanity Declaration]] of the incumbent Emperor which refuted the idea that the Emperor is a living divine being, and dismissed the importance of "myths and legends" for the Emperor's status. However, the Emperors have continued to perform many traditional ceremonies privately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/%257egln/77/7750/775004.htm 役員、総代としての基礎知識 全国神社総代会編集発行「改訂神社役員、総代必携」]{{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ritual Ceremonies of the Imperial Palace - The Imperial Household Agency|url=http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-about/kyuchu/saishi.html|website=www.kunaicho.go.jp|accessdate=22 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of main ritual ceremonies of the Imperial Palace - The Imperial Household Agency|url=http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-about/kyuchu/saishi/saishi01.html|website=www.kunaicho.go.jp|accessdate=22 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
The Emperors traditionally had an education officer. In recent times, [[Emperor Taishō]] had Count [[Nogi Maresuke]], [[Emperor Shōwa]] had Marshal-Admiral Marquis [[Tōgō Heihachirō]], and Emperor [[Akihito]] had [[Elizabeth Gray Vining]] as well as [[:ja:小泉信三|Shinzō Koizumi]] as their tutors.

==Addressing and naming==
There are two Japanese words equivalent to the English word "Emperor": ''tennō'' ({{lang|ja|天皇}}, "heavenly sovereign"), which is used exclusively to refer to the Emperor of Japan, and ''kōtei'' (皇帝, the title used for all other foreign Emperors), which is used primarily to describe non-Japanese Emperors. ''Sumeramikoto'' ("the Imperial person") was also used in [[Old Japanese language|Old Japanese]]. The term ''tennō'' was used by the Emperors up until the Middle Ages; then, following a period of disuse, it was used again from the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779–1822,'' p. 232 n4.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[English language|English]], the term ''mikado'' ({{lang|ja|御門}} or {{lang|ja|帝}}), literally meaning "the honorable gate" (i.e. the gate of the imperial palace, which indicates the person who lives in and possesses the palace), was once used (as in ''[[The Mikado]]'', a 19th-century [[operetta]]), but this term is now obsolete.&lt;ref name="Asakawa1903"&gt;Kanʼichi Asakawa. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K1MuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA25 The early institutional life of Japan: a study in the reform of 645 A.D.]''. Tokyo: Shueisha (1903), p. 25. "We purposely avoid, in spite of its wide usage in foreign literature, the misleading term ''Mikado''. If it be not for the natural curiosity of the races, which always seeks something novel and loves to call foreign things by foreign names, it is hard to understand why this obsolete and ambiguous word should so sedulously be retained. It originally meant not only the Sovereign, but also his house, the court, and even the State, and its use in historical writings causes many difficulties which it is unnecessary to discuss here in detail. The native Japanese employ the term neither in speech nor in writing.  It might as well be dismissed with great advantage from sober literature as it has been for the official documents."&lt;/ref&gt; (Compare [[Sublime Porte]], an old term for the Ottoman government.)

Traditionally, the Japanese considered it disrespectful to call any person by his [[given name]], and more so for a person of noble rank. This convention is only slightly relaxed in the modern age and it is still inadvisable among friends to use the given name, use of the family name being the common form of address. In the case of the imperial family, it is considered extremely inappropriate to use the given name. Since Emperor Meiji, it has been customary to have one [[Japanese era name|era]] per Emperor and to rename each Emperor after his death using the name of the era over which he presided. Before [[Emperor Meiji]], the names of the eras were changed more frequently, and the posthumous names of the Emperors were chosen differently.

[[File:Emperor of Japan - Tenno - New Years 2010.ogv|thumb|right|thumbtime=7|The Emperor of Japan giving a New Year's address to the people in 2010]]

Outside Japan, the previous Emperor is usually called [[Hirohito]] in English, although he was never referred to as Hirohito in Japan, and was renamed ''[[Shōwa Tennō]]'' after his death, which is the only name that Japanese speakers currently use when referring to him.

The current Emperor on the throne is typically referred to as ''Tennō Heika'' ({{lang|ja|天皇陛下}}, "His (Imperial) Majesty the Emperor"), ''Kinjō Heika'' ({{lang|ja|今上陛下}}, "His Current Majesty") or simply ''Tennō'', when speaking Japanese. The current Emperor will be renamed ''Daijō Tennō'' ({{lang|ja|太上天皇}}, Retired Emperor), often shortened to ''Jōkō'' ({{lang|ja|上皇}}), upon his planned retirement on 30 April 2019, and renamed ''Heisei Tennō'' ({{lang|ja|平成天皇}}) after his death and will then be referred to exclusively by that name in Japanese. In Japanese culture, it is considered a major faux pas to refer to a living Emperor by his posthumous name, although the posthumous name is the same as the era, which is used in official documents.

===Origin of the title===
Originally, the ruler of Japan was known as either {{lang|ja|大和大王}}/{{lang|ja|大君}} (Yamato-ōkimi, Grand King of [[Yamato Province|Yamato]]), {{lang|ja|倭王}}/{{lang|ja|倭国王}} (''Wa-ō''/''Wakoku-ō'', [[Five kings of Wa|King of Wa]], used externally) or {{lang|ja|治天下大王}} (''Ame-no-shita shiroshimesu ōkimi'' or ''Sumera no mikoto'', Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally) in Japanese and Chinese sources before the 7th century. The oldest documented use of the word "Tennō" is on a wooden slat, or ''mokkan'', that was unearthed in [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture]] in 1998 and dated back to the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jitō]].{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}

==Marriage traditions==
[[File:Empress Michiko cropped 20140424.jpg|thumb|upright|The current empress, [[Empress Michiko|Michiko]]]]
Throughout history, Japanese Emperors and noblemen appointed the position of chief wife, rather than just keeping a [[harem]] or an assortment of female attendants.

The Japanese imperial dynasty consistently practiced official [[polygamy]], a practice that only ended in the [[Taishō period]] (1912–1926). Besides the Empress, the Emperor could take, and nearly always took, several secondary consorts ("[[concubine]]s") of various hierarchical degrees. Concubines were allowed also to other dynasts ([[Shinnōke]], [[Ōke]]). After a decree by [[Emperor Ichijō]], some Emperors even had two empresses simultaneously (''[[Empress of Japan|kōgō]]'' and ''chūgū'' are the two separate titles for that situation). With the help of all this polygamy, the imperial clan thus was capable of producing more offspring. (Sons by secondary consorts were usually recognized as imperial princes, too, and could be recognized as heir to the throne if the empress did not give birth to an heir.)

Of the eight female Tennō (reigning empresses) of Japan, none married or gave birth after ascending the throne. Some of them, being widows, had produced children before their reigns.

In the succession, children of the empress were preferred over sons of secondary consorts. Thus it was significant which quarters had preferential opportunities in providing chief wives to imperial princes, i.e. supplying future empresses.

Apparently, the oldest tradition of official marriages within the imperial dynasty were marriages between dynasty members, even half-siblings or uncle and niece. Such marriages were deemed to preserve better the imperial blood or were aimed at producing children symbolic of a reconciliation between two branches of the imperial dynasty. Daughters of others remained concubines, until [[Emperor Shōmu]] (701–706)&amp;nbsp;– in what was specifically reported as the first elevation of its kind&amp;nbsp;– elevated his [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] consort [[Empress Kōmyō]] to chief wife.

Japanese monarchs have been, as much as others elsewhere, dependent on making alliances with powerful chiefs and other monarchs. Many such alliances were sealed by marriages. The specific feature in Japan has been the fact that these marriages have been soon incorporated as elements of tradition which controlled the marriages of later generations, though the original practical alliance had lost its real meaning. A repeated pattern has been an imperial son-in-law under the influence of his powerful non-imperial father-in-law.

Beginning from the 7th and 8th centuries, Emperors primarily took women of the [[Fujiwara clan]] as their highest wives — the most probable mothers of future monarchs. This was cloaked as a tradition of marriage between heirs of two ''[[kami]]'' ([[Shinto]] deities): descendants of [[Amaterasu]] with descendants of the family ''kami'' of the Fujiwara. (Originally, the Fujiwara were descended from relatively minor nobility, thus their ''kami'' is an unremarkable one in the Japanese myth world.) To produce imperial children, heirs of the nation, with two-side descent from the two kami, was regarded as desirable — or at least it suited powerful Fujiwara lords, who thus received preference in the imperial marriage market. The reality behind such marriages was an alliance between an imperial prince and a Fujiwara lord, his father-in-law or grandfather, the latter with his resources supporting the prince to the throne and most often controlling the government. These arrangements created the tradition of regents ([[Sesshō and Kampaku]]), with these positions held only by a Fujiwara [[sekke]] lord.

Earlier, the Emperors had married women from families of the government-holding [[Soga clan|Soga]] lords, and women of the imperial clan itself, i.e. various-degree cousins and often even their own sisters (half-sisters). Several imperials of the 5th and 6th centuries such as [[Prince Shōtoku]] were children of half-sibling couples. These marriages often were alliance or succession devices: the Soga lord ensured his domination of a prince who would be put on the throne as a puppet; or a prince ensured the combination of two imperial descents, to strengthen his own and his children's claim to the throne. Marriages were also a means to seal a reconciliation between two imperial branches.

After a couple of centuries, Emperors could no longer take anyone from outside such families as primary wife, no matter what the expediency of such a marriage and power or wealth brought by such might have been. Only very rarely did a prince ascend the throne whose mother was not descended from the approved families. The earlier necessity and expediency had mutated into a strict tradition that did not allow for current expediency or necessity, but only dictated that daughters of a restricted circle of families were eligible brides, because they had produced eligible brides for centuries. Tradition had become more forceful than law.

Fujiwara women were often Empresses, and concubines came from less exalted noble families. In the last thousand years, sons of an imperial male and a Fujiwara woman have been preferred in the succession.

The five Fujiwara families, [[Ichijō family|Ichijō]], [[Kujō family|Kujō]], [[Nijō family|Nijō]], [[Konoe family|Konoe]], and [[Takatsukasa family|Takatsukasa]], were the primary source of imperial brides from the 8th century to the 19th century, even more often than daughters of the imperial clan itself. Fujiwara daughters were thus the usual empresses and mothers of Emperors.

This restriction on brides for the Emperor and crown prince was made explicit in the [[Meiji period|Meiji]]-era Imperial House Law of 1889. A clause stipulated that daughters of Sekke (the five main branches of the higher Fujiwara) and daughters of the imperial clan itself were primarily acceptable brides.

The law was repealed in the aftermath of [[World War II]]. The present Emperor, [[Akihito]], became the first crown prince for over a thousand years to marry a consort from outside the previously eligible circle.

==Burial traditions==
[[File:Musashiryo -01.jpg|thumb|Entrance of the [[Musashi Imperial Graveyard]] in [[Hachiōji, Tokyo]]]]
During the [[Kofun period]], so-called "archaic funerals" were held for the dead Emperors, but only the funerary rites from the end of the period, which the chronicles describe in more detail, are known. They were centered around the rite of the ''mogari'' ({{lang|ja|殯}}), a provisional depository between death and permanent burial.&lt;ref name="Nanzan Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/1853|title=The Funerals of the Japanese Emperors|author=François Macé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empress [[Jitō]] was the first Japanese imperial personage to be cremated (in 703). After that, with a few exceptions, all Emperors were cremated up to the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name="Nanzan Bulletin" /&gt; For the next 350 years, in-ground burial became the favoured funeral custom.

Until 1912, the Emperors of Japan were usually buried in Kyoto.&lt;ref&gt;Seidensticker, Edward. (1990). ''Tokyo Rising,'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Emperor Taishō|Taishō Emperor]] onward, the Emperors have been buried at the [[Musashi Imperial Graveyard]] in Tokyo.

==Succession==
[[File:Imperial place Japan 1979 air.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Tokyo Imperial Palace]]]]
The Japanese imperial dynasty bases its position in the expression that it has "reigned since [[time immemorial]]" ({{lang|ja|万世一系}} ''bansei ikkei''). It is true that its origins are buried in the mists of time: there are no records of any Emperor who was not said to have been a descendant of other, yet earlier Emperors. There is suspicion that [[Emperor Keitai]] (c. 500 AD) may have been an unrelated outsider, though the sources state that he was a male-line descendant of [[Emperor Ōjin]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} However, his descendants, including his successors, were according to records descended from at least one and probably several imperial princesses of the older lineage. The tradition built by those legends has chosen to recognize just the putative male ancestry as valid for legitimizing his succession, not giving any weight to ties through the said princesses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Millennia ago, the Japanese imperial family developed its own peculiar system of hereditary succession. It has been non-primogenitural, more or less agnatic, based mostly on rotation. Today, Japan uses strict [[agnatic primogeniture]], which was adopted from [[Prussia]], by which Japan was greatly influenced in the 1870s.

The controlling principles and their interaction were apparently very complex and sophisticated, leading to even idiosyncratic outcomes. Some chief principles apparent in the succession have been:
* Women were allowed to succeed (but there existed no known children of theirs whose father did not also happen to be an agnate of the imperial house, thus there is neither a precedent that a child of an imperial woman with a non-imperial man could inherit, nor a precedent forbidding it for children of empresses). However, female accession was clearly much more rare than male.
* Adoption was possible and a much used way to increase the number of succession-entitled heirs (however, the adopted child had to be a child of another member agnate of the imperial house).
* Abdication was used very often, and in fact occurred more often than death on the throne. In those days, the Emperor's chief task was priestly (or godly), containing so many repetitive rituals that it was deemed that after a service of around ten years, the incumbent deserved pampered retirement as an honored former Emperor.
* [[Primogeniture]] was not used — rather, in the early days, the imperial house practiced something resembling a system of rotation. Very often a brother (or sister) followed the elder sibling even in the case of the predecessor leaving children. The "turn" of the next generation came more often after several individuals of the senior generation. Rotation went often between two or more of the branches of the imperial house, thus more or less distant cousins succeeded each other. [[Emperor Go-Saga]] even decreed an official alternation between heirs of his two sons, which system continued for a couple of centuries (leading finally to shogun-induced (or utilized) strife between these two branches, the "southern" and "northern" Emperors). Towards the end, the alternates were very distant cousins counted in degrees of male descent (but all that time, intermarriages occurred within the imperial house, thus they were close cousins if female ties are counted). During the past five hundred years, however, probably due to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] influence, inheritance by sons — but not always, or even most often, the eldest son has been the norm.

Historically, the succession to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] has always passed to descendants in male line from the imperial lineage. Generally, they have been males, though over the reign of one hundred monarchs there have been nine women (one pre-historical and eight historical) as Emperor on eleven occasions.

Over a thousand years ago, a tradition started that an Emperor should ascend relatively young. A dynast who had passed his toddler years was regarded suitable and old enough. Reaching the age of legal majority was not a requirement. Thus, a multitude of Japanese Emperors have ascended as children, as young as 6 or 8 years old. The high-priestly duties were deemed possible for a walking child. A reign of around ten years was regarded a sufficient service. Being a child was apparently a fine property, to better endure tedious duties and to tolerate subjugation to political power-brokers, as well as sometimes to cloak the truly powerful members of the imperial dynasty. Almost all Japanese empresses and dozens of Emperors abdicated, and lived the rest of their lives in pampered retirement, wielding influence behind the scenes. Several Emperors abdicated to their entitled retirement while still in their teens. These traditions show in Japanese folklore, theater, literature, and other forms of culture, where the Emperor is usually described or depicted as an adolescent.

Before the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan had eleven reigns of [[Empress of Japan|reigning empresses]], all of them daughters of the male line of the Imperial House. None ascended purely as a wife or as a widow of an Emperor. Imperial daughters and granddaughters, however, usually ascended the throne as a sort of a "stop gap" measure — if a suitable male was not available or some imperial branches were in rivalry so that a compromise was needed. Over half of Japanese empresses and many Emperors abdicated once a suitable male descendant was considered to be old enough to rule (just past toddlerhood, in some cases).  Four empresses, [[Empress Suiko]], [[Empress Kōgyoku]] (also [[Empress Saimei]]), and [[Empress Jitō]], as well as the mythical [[Empress Jingū]], were widows of deceased Emperors and princesses of the blood imperial in their own right. One, [[Empress Genmei]], was the widow of a crown prince and a princess of the blood imperial. The other four, [[Empress Genshō]], [[Empress Kōken]] (also Empress Shōtoku), [[Empress Meishō]], and [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]], were unwed daughters of previous Emperors. None of these empresses married or gave birth after ascending the throne.

Article 2 of the [[Meiji Constitution]] (the Constitution of the Empire of Japan) stated, "The Imperial Throne shall be succeeded to by imperial male descendants, according to the provisions of the Imperial House Law." The 1889 Imperial Household Law fixed the succession on male descendants of the imperial line, and specifically excluded female descendants from the succession. In the event of a complete failure of the main line, the throne would pass to the nearest collateral branch, again in the male line. If the Empress did not give birth to an heir, the Emperor could take a concubine, and the son he had by that concubine would be recognized as heir to the throne. This law, which was promulgated on the same day as the [[Meiji Constitution]], enjoyed co-equal status with that constitution.

Article 2 of the [[Constitution of Japan]], promulgated in 1947 by influence of the U.S. occupation administration, provides that "The Imperial Throne shall be dynastic and succeeded to in accordance with the Imperial Household Law passed by the Diet." The [[Imperial Household Law]] of 1947, enacted by the ninety-second and last session of the Imperial Diet, retained the exclusion on female dynasts found in the 1889 law. The government of Prime Minister [[Yoshida Shigeru]] hastily cobbled together the legislation to bring the Imperial Household in compliance with the American-written [[Constitution of Japan]] that went into effect in May 1947. In an effort to control the size of the imperial family, the law stipulates that only legitimate male descendants in the male line can be dynasts; that imperial princesses lose their status as Imperial Family members if they marry outside the Imperial Family;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Alex, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111216f1.html Imperial law revisited as family shrinks, Emperor ages]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', December 16, 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Emperor and other members of the Imperial Family may not adopt children. It also prevented branches, other than the branch descending from [[Taisho Emperor|Taishō]], from being imperial princes any longer.

===Current status===
{{Main article|Line of succession to the Japanese throne}}
Succession is now regulated by laws passed by the [[National Diet]]. The current law excludes women from the succession. A change to this law had been considered until [[Kiko, Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] gave birth to a [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|son]].

Until the birth of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], son of [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino|Prince Akishino]], on September 6, 2006, there was a potential [[Order of succession|succession]] problem, since Prince Akishino was the only male child to be born into the imperial family since 1965. Following the birth of [[Aiko, Princess Toshi|Princess Aiko]], there was public debate about amending the current Imperial Household Law to allow women to succeed to the throne. In January 2005, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] appointed a special panel composed of judges, university professors, and civil servants to study changes to the [[Imperial Household Law]] and to make recommendations to the government.

The panel dealing with the succession issue recommended on October 25, 2005, amending the law to allow females of the male line of imperial descent to ascend the Japanese throne. On January 20, 2006, Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] devoted part of his annual keynote speech to the controversy, pledging to submit a bill allowing women to ascend the throne to ensure that the succession continues in the future in a stable manner. Shortly after the announcement that [[Princess Kiko]] was pregnant with her third child, Koizumi suspended such plans. Her son, Prince Hisahito, is the third in line to the throne under the current law of succession. On January 3, 2007, Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] announced that he would drop the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2007-01-03-japan-female-monarch_x.htm |title=Report: Japan to drop plan to allow female monarch |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 3, 2007 |publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]] |location=[[McLean, VA]] |issn=0734-7456 |agency=The Associated Press |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth==
Until World War II, the Japanese monarchy was thought to be among the wealthiest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=3 May 1989 |title=Legacy of Hirohito  |work=The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1911, no distinction was made between the imperial crown estates and the Emperor's personal properties, which were considerable. The Imperial Property Law, which came into effect in January 1911, established two categories of imperial properties: the hereditary or crown estates and the personal ("ordinary") properties of the imperial family. The Imperial Household Minister was given the responsibility for observing any judicial proceedings concerning imperial holdings. Under the terms of the law, imperial properties were only taxable in cases where no conflict with the Imperial House Law existed; however, crown estates could only be used for public or imperially-sanctioned undertakings. Personal properties of certain members of the imperial family, in addition to properties held for imperial family members who were minors, were exempted from taxation. Those family members included the Empress Dowager, the Empress, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, the Imperial Grandson and the consort of the Imperial Grandson.&lt;ref name="court_wealth"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Japan - The Imperial Court |title=The Japan-Manchoukuo Year Book |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |publisher=The Japan-Manchoukuo Year Book Co. |publication-date=1938 |pages=50–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the poor economic conditions in Japan, 289,259.25 acres of crown lands (about 26% of the total landholdings) were either sold or transferred to government and private-sector interests in 1921. In 1930, the Nagoya Detached Palace ([[Nagoya Castle]]) was donated to the city of [[Nagoya]], with six other imperial villas being either sold or donated at the same time.&lt;ref name="court_wealth"/&gt; In 1939, [[Nijō Castle]], the former Kyoto residence of the Tokugawa shoguns and an imperial palace since the [[Meiji Restoration]], was likewise donated to the city of Kyoto.

At the end of 1935, according to official government figures, the Imperial Court owned roughly 3,111,965 acres of landed estates, the bulk of which (2,599,548 acres) were the Emperor's private lands, with the total acreage of the crown estates amounting to some 512,161 acres; those landholdings comprised palace complexes, forest and farm lands and other residential and commercial properties. The total value of the imperial properties was then estimated at ¥650 million, or  roughly US$195 million at prevailing exchange rates.&lt;ref name="worth" group="note"&gt;Roughly US$19.9 billion in 2017, in terms of economic status value (https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/uscompare/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="court_wealth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 332–333, "Exchange and Interest Rates", ''Japan Year Book 1938–1939'', Kenkyusha Press, Foreign Association of Japan, Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt; This was in addition to the Emperor's personal fortune, which itself amounted to hundreds of millions of yen and included numerous family heirlooms and furnishings, purebred livestock and investments in major Japanese firms, such as the Bank of Japan, other major Japanese banks, the [[Imperial Hotel (company)|Imperial Hotel]] and [[Nippon Yusen]].&lt;ref name="court_wealth"/&gt;

Following Japan's defeat in the Second World War, all of the collateral branches of the imperial family were abolished under the Allied occupation of the country and the subsequent constitutional reforms, forcing those families to sell their assets to private or government owners. Staff numbers in the imperial households were slashed from a peak of roughly 6000 to about 1000. The imperial estates and the Emperor's personal fortune (then estimated at US$17.15 million, or roughly US$625 million in 2017 terms) were transferred to either state or private ownership, excepting 6,810 acres of landholdings. Since the 1947 constitutional reforms, the imperial family has been supported by an official civil list sanctioned by the Japanese government. The largest imperial divestments were the former imperial Kiso and Amagi forest lands in [[Gifu prefecture|Gifu]] and [[Shizuoka prefecture|Shizuoka]] prefectures, grazing lands for livestock in [[Hokkaido]] and a stock farm in the Chiba region, all of which were transferred to the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]]. Imperial property holdings have been further reduced since 1947 after several handovers to the government. Today, the primary imperial properties include the two Imperial Palaces at Tokyo and Kyoto, imperial villas at [[Hayama Imperial Villa|Hayama]] and at [[Nasu Imperial Villa|Nasu]] and a number of imperial farms and game preserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reed |first=Christopher |date=5 October 1971 |title=Few personal possessions for reigning monarch  |work=The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2017, Akihito, the present Emperor, has an estimated net worth of US$40 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/akihito-net-worth-2017-how-rich-japanese-emperor-parliament-passed-historic-law-his-2549849  |title=Akihito Net Worth 2017: How Rich Is Japanese Emperor As Parliament Passed Historic Law For His Abdication |work=[[The International Business Times]] |date=June 9, 2017 |publisher= |accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact wealth and expenditures of the Emperor and the imperial family have remained a subject of speculation, and were largely withheld from the public until 2003, when Mori Yohei, a former royal correspondent for the ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'', obtained access to 200 documents through a recently passed public information law. Mori's findings, which he published in a book, revealed details of the imperial family's US$240 million civil list (in 2003 values).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/gbp/GBP-to-USD-2003 |title=British Pound to US Dollar Spot Exchange Rates for 2003 from the Bank of England |last= |first= |date= |website=PoundSterling Live |publisher= |access-date=May 27, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other details, the book revealed the royal family employed a staff of over 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/1440830/Book-lifts-the-lid-on-Emperors-high-living.html  |title=Book lifts the lid on Emperor's high living |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=7 September 2003 |publisher= |accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erotomania''' is listed in the DSM 5 as a subtype of a delusional disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Oliveira |first1=C. |last2=Alves |first2=S. |last3=Ferreira |first3=C. |last4=Agostinho |first4=C. |last5=Avelino |first5=M.J.|date=2016|title=Erotomania-A review of De Clerambault's Syndrome.|url=|journal=The Journal of the European Psychiatric Association|volume=33|pages=664|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively uncommon paranoid condition that is characterized by an individual's delusions of another person being infatuated with them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segal, J.H.|first=|date=1989|title=Erotomania revisited: From Kraepelin to DSM-III-R|url=|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=146|pages=1261|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disorder is most often seen (though not exclusively) in female patients that are shy, dependent, and sexually inexperienced. The object of the delusion is typically a male who is unattainable due to high social or financial status, marriage, or disinterest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jordan |first1=H.W. |last2=Lockert |first2=E.W. |last3=Johnson-Warren |first3=M. |last4=Cabell |first4=C. |last5=Cooke |first5=T. |last6=Greer |first6=W. |last7=Howe |first7=G.|date=2006|title=Erotomania revisisted: Thirty-four years later|url=|journal=Journal of the National Medical Association|volume=98|pages=787–793|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of obsession may also be imaginary, deceased, or someone the patient has never met. Delusions of reference are common as the erotomanic individual often perceives that they are being sent messages from the secret admirer through innocuous events such as seeing license plates from specific states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Commonly, the onset of erotomania is sudden and the course is chronic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Presentation==

Erotomania is more common in women, but men are more likely to exhibit violent and stalker-like behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The core symptom of the disorder is that the sufferer holds an unshakable belief that another person is secretly in love with them. In some cases, the sufferer may believe several people at once are "secret admirers". Most commonly, the individual has delusions of being loved by an unattainable man who is usually an acquaintance or someone the person has never met. The sufferer may also experience other types of delusions concurrently with erotomania, such as delusions of reference, wherein the perceived admirer secretly communicates their love by subtle methods such as body posture, arrangement of household objects, colors, license plates on cars from specific states, and other seemingly innocuous acts (or, if the person is a public figure, through clues in the media). Some delusions may be extreme such as the conception, birth, and kidnapping of children that never existed. The delusional objects may be replaced by others over time, and some may be chronic in fixed forms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Denial is characteristic with this disorder as the patients do not accept the fact that their object of delusion may be married, unavailable, or uninterested. The phantom lover may also be imaginary or deceased. Erotomania has two forms: primary and secondary. Primary erotomania is also commonly referred to as de Clerambault's syndrome and Old Maid's Insanity&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and it exists alone without comorbidities, has a sudden onset and a chronic outcome.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The secondary form is found along with mental disorders like paranoid schizophrenia, often includes persecutory delusions, hallucinations, and grandiose ideas, and has a more gradual onset.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Patients with a "fixed" condition are more seriously ill with constant delusions and are less responsive to treatment. These individuals are usually timid, dependent women that are often sexually inexperienced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In those with a more mild, recurrent condition, delusions are shorter-lived and the disorder can exist undetected by others for years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Problematic behaviors include actions like calling, sending letters and gifts, making unannounced house visits and other persistent stalking behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Etiology==

Erotomania may present as a primary mental disorder, or as a symptom of another psychiatric illness. With secondary erotomania, the erotomanic delusions are due to other mental disorders such as bipolar I disorder or schizophrenia. Symptoms may also be precipitated by alcoholism and the use of antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seeman, M.V.|first=|date=2016|title=Erotomania and recommendations for treatment|url=|journal=Psychiatric Quarterly|volume=87|pages=355–364|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be a potential genetic component involved as family histories of first degree relatives with histories of psychiatric disorders are common. [[Sigmund Freud]] explained erotomania as a defense mechanism to ward off homosexual impulses which can lead to strong feelings of paranoia, denial, displacement and projection. Similarly, it has been explained as a way to cope with severe loneliness or ego deficit following a major loss.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Erotomania may also be linked to unsatiated urges dealing with homosexuality or narcissism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly, B.D.|first=|date=2005|title=Erotomania: Epidemiology and management|url=|journal=CNS Drugs|volume=19|pages=657–669|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research shows brain abnormalities occurring in patients with erotomania such as heightened temporal lobe asymmetry and greater volumes of lateral ventricles than those with no mental disorders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Prognosis and Treatment==

Prognosis differs from person to person, and the ideal treatment is not completely understood. Treatment for this disorder gains the best results when tailored specifically for each individual. To date, the mainline pharmacological treatments have been pimozide (a typical antipsychotic which was also approved for treating Tourette's Syndrome),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and atypical anti-psychotics like risperidone and clozapine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Non-pharmacologic treatments that have shown some degree of efficacy are electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), supportive psychotherapy, family and environment therapy,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; rehousing, risk management and treating underlying disorders in cases of secondary erotomania.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ECT may provide temporary remission of delusional beliefs; anti-psychotics help attenuate delusions and reduce agitation or associated dangerous behaviors, and SSRIs may be used to treat secondary depression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In delusional disorder there is some evidence that pimozide has superior efficacy compared with other antipsychotics. Psychosocial psychiatric interventions can enhance the quality of life through allowing some social functioning, and treating comorbid disorders is a priority for secondary erotomania.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Family therapy, adjustment of socio-environmental factors, and replacing delusions with something positive may be beneficial to all. In most cases, harsh confrontation should be avoided.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Structured risk assessment helps to manage risky behaviors in those individuals more likely to engage in actions that include violence, stalking, and crime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For particularly troublesome cases, neuroleptics and enforced separation may be moderately effective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

[[File:Female patient suffering from erotomania, 1843 Wellcome L0022720.jpg|thumb|268x268px|M.S.P. "Female patient suffering from erotomania," from [[Alexander Morison]]'s ''The Physiognomy of Mental Diseases'']]Early references to the condition can be found in the work of Hippocrates, Freud (1911), G.G. de Clérambault (1942),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Erasistratus, Plutarch and Galen. Parisian physician, Bartholomy Pardoux (1545-1611) covered the topics of nymphomania and erotomania.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1623, erotomania was referred to in a treatise by Jacques Ferrand&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (Maladie d'amour ou Mélancolie érotique) and has been called "erotic paranoia" and "erotic self-referent delusion" until the common usage of the terms erotomania and de Clérambault's syndrome. In 1971 and 1977, M.V. Seeman referred to the disorder as "phantom lover syndrome" and "psychotic erotic transference reaction and delusional loving".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Emil Kraepelin and Bernard also wrote of erotomania and more recently, Winokur, Kendler, and Munro have contributed to knowledge on the disorder.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

G. E. Berrios and N. Kennedy outlined in 'Erotomania: a conceptual history' (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berrios GE, Kennedy N|first=|date=2002|title=Erotomania: a conceptual history|url=|journal=History of Psychiatry|volume=13 (52, pt4)|pages=381–400|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; several periods of history through which the definition of erotomania has changed considerably:

*Classical times – early eighteenth century: General disease caused by unrequited love
*Early eighteenth-beginning of nineteenth century: Practice of excess physical love (akin to nymphomania or satyriasis)
*Early nineteenth century – beginning twentieth century: Unrequited love as a form of mental disease
*Early twentieth century – present: Delusional belief of "being loved by someone else"

In one case, erotomania was reported in a patient who had undergone surgery for a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Anderson |first1=CA |last2=Camp |first2=J |last3=Filley |first3=C.M.|date=1998|title=Erotomania after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: case report and literature review|url=|journal=J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci|volume=10 (3)|pages=330–337|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Well-known cases==

In his paper that described the syndrome, de Clérambault referenced a patient he had counselled who was obsessed with British monarch George V.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crimefeed.com/2013/10/9-stalkers-that-make-us-glad-were-not-famous/|title=9 Stalkers That Make Us Glad We're Not Famous.|last1=McDonnell |last2=Margaux |last3=McPadden.|first=|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had stood outside Buckingham Palace for hours at a time, believing that the king was communicating his desire for her by moving the curtains.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Parallels were drawn between this and a 2011 case where the body of a homeless American man was found on a secluded [[traffic island]] within sight of Buckingham Palace. The man had sent hundreds of "strange and offensive" packages to Queen Elizabeth II over the previous 15 years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The assassination attempt on [[Ronald Reagan]] by [[John Hinckley, Jr.]] has been reported to have been driven by an erotomanic fixation on [[Jodie Foster]], whom Hinckley was attempting to impress.[3]

Late night TV entertainer [[David Letterman]] and former astronaut [[Story Musgrave]] were both stalked by [[Margaret Mary Ray]], who suffered from erotomania.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Michael David Barrett allegedly suffered from erotomania, stalking ESPN correspondent Erin Andrews across the country, trying to see her and taking lewd videos.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is important to note that many cases of obsession or stalking can be linked to erotomania but do not always necessarily go hand in hand.

==Portrayals in fiction==

The horror of erotomania can be seen in these films:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gediman|first=Helen|date=2016|title=Stalker, Hacker, Voyeur, Spy: A Psychoanalytic Study of Erotomania, Voyeurism, Surveillance, and Invasions of Privacy|url=|journal=Karnac Books.|volume=|pages=21–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3865">[[File:Fiesta de Toros.jpg|Sacrifice of the bull following a ''corrida''|thumb]]
'''Fiesta de Toros del Señor de Girón''' is a festival held each year in [[Girón, Azuay|Girón]], [[Ecuador]]. It is the most popular festival in the canton of Girón and is one of the most important festivals in [[Azuay Province]].&lt;ref name=arranca&gt;[http://www.elmercurio.com.ec/218890-arranca-fiesta-de-toros-en-giron.html "Arranca Fiesta de Toros en Girón"]. ''[[El Mercurio (Ecuador)|El Mercurio]]'' (November 19, 2008). {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gov&gt;[http://www.giron.gov.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=116:fiesta-de-toros&amp;catid=52:noticias&amp;Itemid=82&amp;layout=default&amp;date=2017-04-01 "Fiesta de Toros"]. Gobierno Municipal de Girón (November 8, 2009). {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival celebrates the Señor de las Aguas de Girón, an image of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified Christ]] that is located in Girón's church.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; The image is believed to bring rain; it is celebrated to bring blessings to agriculture and livestock.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; The origins of the festival are unclear. Some say that it is adapted from customs practiced by their ancestors, while others claim that it is a Spanish custom that combined with local influences.&lt;ref name=orden/&gt;

The festival takes place around November,&lt;ref name=orden&gt;Ruth Orden. [http://www.eluniverso.com/2003/11/22/0001/12/E409AF4D6EB84A92BAA706AA4CA61B5A.html "La fiesta de toros en Girón, con la matiz de migración"]. ''[[El Universo]]'' (November 23, 2003). {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the festival's length depends on the number of ''priostes'' (hosts), who provide the funds for the festival.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; In recent years, it has lasted six weeks.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; The ''priostes'' are generally Ecuadorian emigrants living in the United States and other countries.&lt;ref name=arranca/&gt;&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; Each week, there is one primary ''prioste'' called the "Fiesta Alcalde" and two secondary hosts called the "Incierro Izquierdo" and the "Incierro Derecho".&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

The highlight of the festival are the ''corridas'' ([[Running of the Bulls|runnings of the bulls]]) held each Saturday. Bulls are brought into a plaza and released, so that they can be chased and brought back to the plaza. Young people re-capture the animals, often by pulling on their tails, and bring the animals back to the plaza. Upon the bulls' return, one or more of the bulls is killed as a sacrifice. Dozens of participants surround the bull and take turns drinking the blood that flows from it as it dies. It is commonly believed that the blood is good for the health. After the drinking of the blood, the bull is cleaned and prepared for being served in later festivities.&lt;ref name=fe&gt;[http://www.elmercurio.com.ec/219377-la-fe-con-sabor-a-sangre.html "La fe con sabor a sangre"]. ''[[El Mercurio (Ecuador)|El Mercurio]]'' (October 26, 2008). {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To accompany the corridas, there are bands and dancing, as well as ''platilleras'' (girls chosen from the surrounding area, dressed in traditional clothing). Many of the ''platilleras'' are Ecuadorians who have returned from the United States to participate in the festivities. There are exchanges of bottles of liquor with the hosts and ''agua de canela'' (cinnamon water) as a sign of friendship and good luck.&lt;ref name=fe/&gt;

'''''From the Earth to the Moon''''' is a 12-part 1998 [[HBO]] [[miniseries|television miniseries]] co-produced by [[Ron Howard]], [[Brian Grazer]], [[Tom Hanks]], and Michael Bostick, telling the story of the landmark ''[[Apollo program|Apollo]]'' expeditions to the [[Moon]] during the 1960s and early 1970s in [[docudrama]] format. Largely based on [[Andrew Chaikin]]'s book, ''[[A Man on the Moon]]'', the series is known for its accurate telling of the story of Apollo and the outstanding [[special effect]]s under visual director Ernest D. Farino.

The series takes its title from, but is not based upon, the famous [[Jules Verne]] [[science fiction]] novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''. Hanks appears in every episode, introducing each of the first eleven. The last episode is represented in a pseudo-[[Documentary film|documentary]] format narrated by [[Blythe Danner]], interspersed with a reenactment of the making of [[Georges Méliès]]' film ''[[A Trip to the Moon|Le Voyage dans la Lune]]''. Hanks narrates and appears in these scenes as Méliès' assistant.

==Cast==
{{Main article|List of From the Earth to the Moon characters}}
The miniseries has a fairly large cast, driven in part by the fact that it portrays 30 of the [[List of Apollo astronauts|32 astronauts who flew, or were preparing to fly, the twelve missions]] of the [[Apollo program]]. (The only two Apollo astronauts not portrayed by credited actors are [[Apollo 13]] [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] pilot [[Jack Swigert]] and [[Apollo 17]] Command Module pilot [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]], who had a brief appearance in the liftoff scene of [[Apollo 17]] in the final episode.) Members of many of the astronauts' families, and other [[NASA]] and non-NASA personnel, are also portrayed.

Several fictional (or fictionalized) characters are also included, notably television newscaster Emmett Seaborn ([[Lane Smith]]) who appears in nine of the twelve episodes.

==Episodes==
The twelve episodes, each directed by different individuals, use a variety of viewpoints and themes, while sequentially covering the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs. [[Lane Smith]] portrays Emmett Seaborn, a seasoned reporter for a fictional television network, who covers the U.S. space program from its earliest days, providing continuity for most of the episodes.

Veteran [[television|TV]] spaceflight reporter Emmett Seaborn ([[Lane Smith]]) is summoned to broadcast the breaking news of the in-flight failure, as young reporter Brett Hutchings ([[Jay Mohr]]) is pulled off of sports to help with the coverage. As the crisis unfolds, Seaborn finds himself at odds with Hutchings' style of sensationalizing its impact on the astronauts' families, and criticizing NASA. Seaborn starts to feel he is being marginalized when the network decides to leave Hutchings on location in Houston, while sending him back to headquarters to provide only background coverage. The last straw falls when, after the successful recovery of the astronauts, Hutchings horns in on his traditional post-flight interview with flight controller [[Gene Kranz]]. Seaborn leaves dejectedly, not to be seen again until the flight of [[Apollo 17]] in the final episode.

| ShortSummary=In 1964, while riding high on his fame as America's first man in space and his expected command of the first Gemini mission, [[Alan Shepard]] is suddenly struck with [[Ménière's disease]], characterized by vertigo and nausea. Flight operations director Deke Slayton must ground him, but offers him the job of chief astronaut, effectively making Shepard Slayton's assistant as supervisor of all the astronauts. A few years later, a surgeon tries an experimental surgery which cures Shepard's symptoms, and he is returned to the flight rotation, commanding [[Apollo 14]] in early 1971, which accomplishes Apollo 13's failed Fra Mauro landing. Shepard brings a [[iron (golf)|six-iron golf club]] head on board, which he fastens to a soil-collecting tool handle and uses to hit a ball "for miles and miles".

Silver takes the four [[Apollo 15]] prime and backup landing crew members ([[David Scott]], [[James Irwin]], [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.]], and Schmitt) to the southwestern desert, while lunar geologist [[Farouk El-Baz]] trains the Command Module pilots ([[Alfred Worden]] and [[Vance D. Brand]]) in high-altitude recognition of geological features using airplane flights over Hawaii. Schmitt is disappointed to learn his own Apollo 18 flight will be cancelled, but he still believes the training of the other astronauts is vital. It pays off when Scott and Irwin find the "[[Genesis Rock]]", originally believed to come from the Moon's primordial crust. The title refers to Scott's reproduction of an experiment proving [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s hypothesis that gravity will cause bodies of differing masses to fall at the same rate in a vacuum, by dropping a hammer and a feather.

Simulated interviews of various characters such as Emmett Seaborn and flight director [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr.]], in old-age makeup, are included. The documentary is interspersed with the story of early French film maker [[Georges Méliès]]' creation of his vision of a trip to the Moon, the 1902 ''[[A Trip to the Moon|Le Voyage dans la Lune]]''. Scenes from the original film are merged with the recreation of its filming.| LineColor=191970  }}

==Integration with existing films==
The miniseries, concentrating on the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] space program, was produced with an intent not to repeat other dramatic portrayals of events of the space race.

[[Project Mercury]], which was portrayed in the film ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'', was briefly summarized in the first episode.  Miniseries producers Hanks, Howard and Grazer, who had previously produced ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', shot the episode "We Interrupt This Program" from the perspective of the media covering that flight, as the film had already covered the story from the point of view of the crew and the mission control team.

==Production information==
Many of the actors had opportunity to interact and form friendships with the real life astronauts they were portraying.  [[Brett Cullen]], who played [[Apollo 9]] [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] pilot and [[Apollo 15]] commander [[David Scott]], was invited to the Scott family home each time an episode he appeared in was first televised. Two short clips from the final scenes of ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' were used in "That's All There Is"; a splashdown sequence, and a view of the recovery ship [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']] (portrayed by [[USS New Orleans (LPH-11)|USS ''New Orleans'']]).

The original series was shot in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, intended to be viewed on standard television sets. The series was released on DVD as a 4-disc set. With the proliferation of widescreen flat-panel TV sets the series was remastered in 1.78:1 aspect ratio and re-released in 2005 as a 5-disc DVD box set. New framing causes loss of top and bottom parts of the frames from the original movie. This is not always noticeable because of careful transfer process, but in some scenes important details are lost. For example, in Disc 1, when the Gemini 8 / Agena assembly is tumbling around the sky with a stuck thruster, the thruster is not visible in the new widescreen version as it is cut off by the top of the frame. Some captions have also been compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/review/R14N5WVCNCBTH2/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm|title=From the Earth to the Moon: 2005 Signature Series DVD Box set, user's comments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of the mini-series were filmed at the Disney-MGM Studios (now [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]) in Orlando, Florida.  Scenes of the moonwalks were shot inside the blimp hangars on the former Marine base in Tustin, California. Approximately half the area inside was converted to the Moon's surface, with the remainder used to hold production trailers.  To simulate lunar [[surface gravity]], weather balloons filled with helium were attached to the backs of the actors playing the astronauts in the lunar [[extravehicular activity]] scenes, effectively reducing their Earth-bound weights to one-sixth.

The score of "Spider" prominently features an imitation of the main title theme from the 1963 [[World War II]] movie ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', and Tom Kelly jokes about having a crew digging a tunnel out of the Grumman plant. The episode also featured a real [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM-13), which had been built for the Apollo 18 mission but was never used due to budget cuts. [[Blythe Danner]], who narrated the final episode, had previously worked on location at the [[Johnson Space Center]] for the 1976 movie ''[[Futureworld]]'', filmed in the same buildings where Apollo moonwalkers had recently trained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/media/rm2119730432/tt0074559|title=Futureworld (1976)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/media/rm1196983552/tt0074559|title=Futureworld (1976)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The series won 3 Emmy awards for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries|Outstanding Miniseries]], [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries, Movie, or a Special|Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries or a Movie]] and Outstanding Hairstyling for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special. In addition, the series won a 1999 [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV]].

{{Great Recession sidebar}}
The '''Great Recession in South America''', as it mainly consists of commodity exporters, was not directly affected by the financial turmoil, even if the bond markets of [[Economy of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Economy of Argentina|Argentina]], [[Economy of Colombia|Colombia]] and [[Economy of Venezuela|Venezuela]] have been hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/business/newsid_6922000/6922832.stm |title= "Subprime": lejos de A.

On the other hand, the continent experienced a tough [[2008 global rice shortage|agricultural crisis]] at the beginning of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclac.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/prensa/noticias/comunicados/0/34740/P34740.xml&amp;xsl=/prensa/tpl-i/p6f.xsl&amp;base=/tpl-i/top-bottom.xsl Poverty Declines Slightly in Latin America and the Caribbean, in Spite of Global Financial Crisis], ECLAC Notes Nº 59 (9 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Food prices have increased a lot, due to a lack of arable land. One of the main reasons for the loss of agricultural land was the high value offered by the production of [[biofuel]]s. However, second generation biofuel processes is slowly being implemented in order to  extend the amount of biofuel that can be produced [[sustainably]] by using biomass consisting of the residual [[non-food]] parts of current crops, such as [[Plant stem|stem]]s, [[Leaf|leaves]] and [[husk]]s.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b822951c | author = Oliver R.

In one year the average price of food rose by about 50%.

Then South American countries were affected by both the global slowdown and the decrease in food prices due to the declining demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.eclac.org/prensa/noticias/notas/3/34963/Notes59ENGFinal.pdf |title= Latin America risks reverting progress in poverty reduction / Global financial crisis will affect region’s trade with the rest of the world| publisher = ECLAC |date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC) declared it expected a 4% growth for 2009.

==Countries==

===Brazil===
While previously thought immune to the [[Late 2000s recession|global financial crisis]], the [[economy of Brazil]] shrank 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2008, with industrial production in January 2009, 17.2% below that of January 2008. Growth for 2008 as a whole was 5.1%. Capital spending fell 9.8% in the fourth quarter while household consumption fell 2% from the third quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/10604/ "Brazil Shrinks 3.5%, Worst Decline in 13 Years"], ''Brazzil'', 11 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Another report, in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', showed drop in [[gross domestic product]] of 13.6% in the 4th quarter of 2008 on an [[wikt:annualise|annualized rate]] and a drop in industrial production for December, 2008 to a rate 18.6% lower than December 2007, with a loss of over 700,000 jobs between November 2008 and February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Regalado, Antonio.

===Argentina===
As the second-largest economy in South America and an important exporter of both machinery and agricultural goods, [[Argentina]] has been affected by the global slowdown. The country has been seeing slower economic growth recently, seeing its growth rate forecast reduced from nearly 7% in 2008 to 0% in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/312327/Economia/FMI_dijo_economia_argentina_no_crecera_2009.html |title=El FMI dijo que la economía argentina no crecerá en 2009 |publisher=La Gaceta |location=Tucuman, Argentina |date=Feb 5, 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and due to the steep drop in commodities prices, plus a long, damaging drought in the farm provinces, local economists believe the country may fall into recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1095594 |title=Prevén que éste será el peor año económico desde 2002 |publisher=La Nacion |location=Buenos Aires, Argentina |date=Feb 2, 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat the effects of the financial crisis, the government announced a $32 billion [[Stiumulus (economics)|stimulus]] package that is intended to create some 380,000 jobs and favor small and medium-sized businesses, with investment in [[infrastructure]], gas pipelines and electricity generators, as well as the completion by 2010 of a new [[nuclear power]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=323392&amp;CategoryId=14093 |title=Argentina Announces $32 Billion Stimulus Package |publisher=Latin American Herald |location=Buenos Aires, Argentina |date=Dec 29, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, former President [[Néstor Kirchner]], the husband of the current president, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] and leader of the ruling [[Justicialist Party]], said in a speech on February 17, 2009, that due to the international crisis, Argentina in 2009 will face "the most difficult year in the last century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cronista.com/notas/176891-para-el-ex-presidente-el-2009-sera-el-ano-mas-dificil-los-ultimos-cien-y-pidio-memoria |title=Para el ex presidente, el 2009 será "el año más difícil de los últimos cien" y pidió "memoria" |publisher=El Cronista |location=Buenos Aires, Argentina |date=Feb 19, 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecuador===
[[Ecuador]] is seeking ways to [[Default (finance)|default]] on [[sovereign debt]]s incurred under the government of [[Gustavo Noboa]], which the present government deems to have been incurred illegally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ic7_tIU4eNg_aS1NENnza0naTsVwD94S2DA00 Ecuador renews default threats]&lt;/ref&gt; If Ecuador defaults, it will be the first [[developing country]] to default on sovereign debt since the crisis began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfor.com Stratfor.com homepage, December 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caribbean Islands===
The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) said as soon as February 2008 that a U.S. slowdown would hurt the economies of the [[Caribbean Islands]], especially those in the Eastern Islands. Indeed, the [[tourism]] sector makes up a large part of the Islands' economies, so that they are heavily dependent on the number of U.S. visitors each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.propertywire.com/news/south-america/caribbean-islands-may-be-hit-by-us-recession-20080213426.html |title= Caribbean islands may be hit by US recession |publisher = Property Wire| date= 13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lower [[inflation]] and [[currency depreciation]] in several Latin American and Caribbean nations can have offset this impact of the financial crisis, sustaining the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.eclac.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/prensa/noticias/comunicados/2/34892/P34892.xml&amp;xsl=/prensa/tpl-i/p6f.xsl&amp;base=/prensa/tpl-i/top-bottom.xsl |title= Central America and the Caribbean Will Be the Most Affected Subregions By Standstill in Tourism|publisher= ECLAC|date= 23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hot Dog Days''' are informal events that are celebrated in communities throughout the hotdog-eating world, including the United States, Canada, [[Great Britain]] and Australia. Their origin is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.holidayinsights.com/moreholidays/July/hotdogday.htm | title = National Hot Dog Day | work = Holiday Insights | publisher = Premier Star Co. | accessdate = 21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name suggests, the festivals revolve around eating [[hot dogs]], but usually there are many other activities such as [[wiener dog]] races, [[root beer]] chugging contests, and [[Body painting#Face painting|face painting]]. Often the proceeds from a hot dog day are given to charity.&lt;ref name="press_release_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HotDogSafari/&gt; Industry groups, such as [[National Hot Dog and Sausage Council]] in the USA, encourage, sponsor, and support the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hot-dog.org/resources/national-hot-dog-month-planning-guide | title = National Hot Dog Month Planning Guide | year = 2016 | publisher = National Hot Dog and Sausage Council | accessdate = 6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council designates July as National Hot Dog Month; National Hot Dog Day varies year to year – in 2018 it falls on Wednesday, July 18 – based on when the [[North American Meat Institute]] hosts its annual Hot Dog Lunch on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.meatinstitute.org/2013/07/is-today-national-hot-dog-day-a-look-at-the-hot-dog-day-mystery/|title=Is Today National Hot Dog Day?

==Notable Hot Dog Festivals==

===Alfred Village Hot Dog Day===
[[Image:Hot Dog Day 2007 1.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A crowd at Hot Dog Day 2007. Alfred University's Howell Hall and statue of King Alfred are visible on the left.]]
Hot Dog Day is celebrated in the spring in the village of [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]].  It has been celebrated since 1971, when students first proposed it.&lt;ref name="herrick"&gt;{{cite web | title = Hot Dog Day | url = http://herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/trad/hdd.cfm | accessdate = 2008-12-17 | work = Archives and Special Collections: Herrick Memorial Library | publisher = Herrick Memorial Library at [[Alfred University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619050924/http://herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/trad/hdd.cfm |archivedate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is focused on the [[hot dog]], a food popular among college students for its cheapness and ease of preparation.  Hot Dog Day itself is usually the third Saturday in April, although many students celebrate the entire "hot dog week", running from that Wednesday to that Sunday.

Hot Dog Day, which is organized primarily by students from [[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]], raises money for local charities and community organizations such as Alfred [[firefighter|fire department]] and Alfred [[Montessori method|Montessori school]].&lt;ref name="press_release_2007"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Seven Allegany County charities share in Hot Dog Day 2007 proceeds | url = http://www.alfred.edu/pressreleases/viewrelease.cfm?ID=4435 | accessdate = 2008-12-17 | publisher = Alfred University | date = 2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events typically include a [[parade]], ice cream social, "fun run", mud Olympics, hot dog eating contests, carnival, and live music.  Main Street, which is closed to traffic, hosts most of these activities along with food choices such as a chicken [[barbecue]] and numerous hot dog stands. Hot Dog Day is often the time chosen for [[alumni]] reunions for Alfred's two colleges.

===Boston Hot Dog Safari===
The Boston Hot Dog Safari is an annual charity benefit founded by [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] sports radio host [[Eddie Andelman]]. The charity began in 1990 to help find a cure for [[cystic fibrosis]] by raising money for the Joey Fund, named after a friend of his who died of the disease in 1986 at the age of twelve. One of Andelman's all-time favorite foods are [[hot dog]]s, which is why the charity is called the Hot Dog Safari.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The Hot Dog Safari is one of the most popular charity events in Boston today. Over the years, it has a gained a steady flow of participants as well as money for charity. In one single day, an estimated $150,000 dollars was raised to help find a cure for cystic fibrosis. Medical experts have said that finding a cure for the disease is close to being found in only a few years' time.

The Safari is an all-you-eat supply of hot dogs, sausages, and ice cream sundaes. Money is earned from tickets (sold either at the door or in advance) and raffles. Entertainment is also provided.&lt;ref name=HotDogSafari&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hotdogsafari.com | title = Boston Hot Dog Safari | accessdate = 21 December 2008 | publisher = Phantom Gourmet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''I Don't Like Mondays'''" is a song by Irish band [[The Boomtown Rats]] about the [[Cleveland Elementary School shooting (San Diego)|1979 Cleveland Elementary School shooting]] in San Diego. The song was a number one [[single (music)|single]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] for four weeks during the summer of 1979,&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Roberts | year=2006 | title=[[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]] | edition=19th | publisher=Guinness World Records Limited | location=London | isbn=1-904994-10-5 | pages=370–1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranks as the sixth biggest hit of the UK in 1979.&lt;ref name="top-source1979"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-charts.top-source.info/top-100-1979.shtml |title=Top 100 1979 - UK Music Charts |publisher=Uk-charts.top-source.info |date= |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Bob Geldof]], it was the band's second number one single.

The full length version appeared on the group's third album, ''[[The Fine Art of Surfacing]]''. It includes a reprise of the first verse, which was edited for the single release.

==History==
According to Geldof, he wrote the song after reading a [[Teletypewriter message|telex]] report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b038428z&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Georgia State University]]'s campus radio station, [[WRAS (FM)|WRAS]], on the shooting spree of 16-year-old [[Cleveland_Elementary_School_shooting_(San_Diego)#Brenda_Spencer|Brenda Ann Spencer]], who [[Cleveland Elementary School shooting (San Diego)|fired at children in a school playground]] at Grover Cleveland Elementary School in San Diego, California, US on 29 January 1979, killing two adults and injuring eight children and one police officer. Spencer showed no remorse for her crime and her full explanation for her actions was "I don't like Mondays. This livens up the day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/music/songs/mondays.asp | title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Music (I Don't Like Mondays) | first=Barbara | last=Mikkelson | date=29 September 2005 | work=snopes.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geldof had been contacted by [[Steve Jobs]] to play a gig for Apple, inspiring the opening line about a 'Silicon chip'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b038428z&lt;/ref&gt; The song was first performed less than a month later. 

Geldof explained how he wrote the song:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was doing a radio interview in [[Atlanta]] with [[Johnnie Fingers|[Johnnie] Fingers]] and there was a telex machine beside me. I read it as it came out. Not liking Mondays as a reason for doing somebody in is a bit strange. I was thinking about it on the way back to the hotel and I just said 'Silicon chip inside her head had switched to overload'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b038428z&lt;/ref&gt; I wrote that down. And the journalists interviewing her said, 'Tell me why?' It was such a senseless act. It was the perfect senseless act and this was the perfect senseless reason for doing it. So perhaps I wrote the perfect senseless song to illustrate it. It wasn't an attempt to exploit tragedy.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book | last=Clarke | first=Steve | title=The Fastest Lip on Vinyl | work=[[Smash Hits]] | publisher=EMAP National Publications Ltd | date=18–31 October 1979 | pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Geldof had originally intended the song as a B-side, but changed his mind after the song was successful with audiences on the Rats' US tour.&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt; Spencer's family tried unsuccessfully to prevent the single from being released in the United States.&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt; Despite being a major hit in the United Kingdom, it only reached #73 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Top Pop Singles 1955-1999 | first=Joel | last=Whitburn | year=2000 | publisher=[[Record Research]] Inc | page=65 | isbn=0-89820-139-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was played regularly by album-oriented rock format radio stations in the United States throughout the 1980s, although radio stations in San Diego refrained from playing the track for some years in respect to local sensitivities about the shooting. 

The strings were arranged by Fiachra Trench. Apart from Geldof, pianist Johnnie Fingers and drummer Simon Crowe are the only members of the group who appear on the recording.

In the UK the song reached Number One on the singles chart in July 1979, and won the Best Pop Song and Outstanding British Lyric categories at the [[Ivor Novello Awards]].&lt;ref name="songfacts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=698 | title=I Don't Like Mondays | work=Songfacts.com | accessdate=2009-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Live performances ==

On 9 September 1981, Geldof was joined on stage by fellow Boomtown Rat, Johnnie Fingers, to perform the song for [[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball|The Secret Policeman's Ball]] sponsored by [[Amnesty International]].  A recording of that performance appears on the 1982 album, [[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]. 

The Boomtown Rats performed the song for [[Live Aid]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in 1985. This was the band's final major appearance. On singing the line, "And the lesson today is how to die", Geldof paused for 20 seconds&lt;!--timed from the video--&gt; while the crowd applauded on the significance to those starving in Africa that Live Aid was intended to help. 

At a concert in London in 1995, almost ten years later to the day, [[Bon Jovi]] covered the song after being joined on stage by Geldof at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. This recorded performance features on Bon Jovi's live album ''[[One Wild Night Live 1985–2001]]'', as well as on the bonus 2-CD edition of ''[[These Days (Bon Jovi album)|These Days]]''. Bon Jovi was again joined by Geldof for a performance of the song at The [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] on 23 June 2010, the 10th night of their 12-night residency. Geldof himself performed a version of the song while hosting the [[Live 8]] concert in London, on 2 July 2005.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} 

"I Don't Like Mondays" was subsequently covered by [[Tori Amos]] on her 2001 album ''[[Strange Little Girls]]'' and later by [[G4 (band)|G4]] on their 2006 album ''[[Act Three (G4 album)|Act Three]]''.

The '''''Journal for Geoclimatic Studies''''' is the name given to a nonexistent journal which published a fabricated [[global warming]] study in November 2007 entitled, "Carbon dioxide production by benthic bacteria: the death of manmade global warming theory?" The published study identified the ''Journal for Geoclimatic Studies'' as an official publication of [[Okinawa University]]'s '''Institute for Geoclimatic Studies''' (The Institute for Geoclimatic Studies is also fraudulent and does not exist). The spurious study, ostensibly authored by Daniel Klein and Mandeep J. Gupta of the [[University of Arizona]]'s Department of Climatology, and Philip Cooper and Arne FR Jansson at the [[University of Gothenburg]]'s Department of Atmospheric Physics, claimed that global warming was not human caused, but the work of carbon-dioxide emitting bacteria based on the ocean floor.  

The report was circulated by a number of global warming skeptics before discovery that the study authors and university departments identified in the publication did not exist.  The website where the study was published was taken down once the deception was revealed, and its ownership was traced to David Thorpe, a science journalist and web designer based in the [[United Kingdom]].  The true author of the article is purportedly a man identifying himself as Mark Cox, who has claimed the [[hoax]] was designed to expose the gullibility and scientific illiteracy of [[global warming skeptics]].

'''Kaziuko mugė''' or '''Saint Casimir's Fair''' is a large annual [[folk art]]s and crafts [[fair]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], dating to the beginning of the 17th century. The fair is traditionally held in city's markets and streets on the Sunday nearest to March 4 (Feast of St. Casimir), the anniversary of [[Saint Casimir|Saint Casimir's]] death. In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], ''Kaziukas'' is a [[diminutive]] of ''Casimir''. Today, Saint Casimir's fair  also features music, dance, theater performances; it attracts tens of thousands of visitors and many craftsmen from across Lithuania as well as from neighbouring countries such as [[Latvia]], [[Russia]], and [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=manel/&gt; In recent years, the fair has expanded into other cities in Lithuania, Belarus, Poland.

==History and location==
[[File:Kaziukas-1939.png|thumb|Vendor of Casimir's Hearts in 1939]]
St. Casimir, son of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]], was canonized in 1602.&lt;ref name=manel/&gt; In conjunction with his [[feast day]] celebrations, merchants established a fair. In 1827, they received a privilege to hold the fair in the [[Cathedral Square, Vilnius|Cathedral Square]]. In 1901, after a monument to [[Catherine the Great]] was unveiled in the Cathedral Square, the fair was moved to [[Lukiškės Square]].&lt;ref name=dumal/&gt; During the [[Lithuanian SSR|Soviet era]], the fair was held in [[Kalvarijos Market]]. In 1991, it returned to the [[Old Town of Vilnius]].&lt;ref name=manel/&gt; It was first held in [[Pilies Street]] but has since grown to span [[Gediminas Avenue]], traverse the Cathedral Square, and branch out into Pilies Street, [[Barbara Radziwill|B. Radvilaitės]] Street, passing [[St. Anne's Church, Vilnius|St. Anne's Church]], and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Cathedral of the Theotokos]], and into the Tymas' Quarter on the left bank of [[Vilnia River]] near [[Užupis]].&lt;ref name=savic/&gt; It is estimated that as of 2013, the fair attracted 2,000 merchants and half a million visitors over three days (Friday to Sunday).&lt;ref name=balsas/&gt;

In recent years the fair has expanded into other cities in Lithuania, including [[Kaunas]] (in [[Laisvės alėja]] and [[Town Hall, Kaunas|Town Hall Square]]), [[Alytus]], [[Klaipėda]].&lt;ref name=manel/&gt; Similar festivals called ''Kaziuki'' are also held in several cities in Poland, e.g. in [[Lidzbark Warmiński]], [[Olsztyn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewandowska|first1=Izabela|title=The tradition and the contemporary of multiculturalism in Warmia and Masuria|journal=Region and Regionalism|date=2007|volume=2|issue=8|page=101|publisher=University of Łódź, Silesian Institute of Opole}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Szczecin]], [[Gdańsk]] and [[Poznań]],&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} ''[http://radioszczecin.pl/4,96936,kiermasz-i-koncert-czyli-kaziuki-po-szczecinsku Kiermasz i koncert, czyli Kaziuki po szczecińsku]'', [[Szczecin]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} ''[http://www.gdansk.pl/nasze-miasto,512,5773.html Wileńskie Kaziuki w Gdańsku]'', [[Gdańsk]] official website for celebrations in Gdańsk.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} ''[http://miasta.gazeta.pl/poznan/1,36001,4978276.html Kaziuk Wileński w niedzielę w Poznaniu]'', [[Gazeta Wyborcza]], [[Poznań]].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Hrodna]], [[Belarus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} {{cite web|title=W Grodnie rozpoczęły się Kaziuki|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/78/3564/Artykul/1590827,W-Grodnie-rozpoczely-sie-Kaziuki|website=polskieradio.pl|publisher=IAR|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city where St. Casimir died.
A smaller version of the fair is also held by Lithuanian communities abroad, including inside the Lithuanian World Center in [[Lemont, Illinois]].

==Features==
[[File:Verbos Kaziuko mugeje.jpg|thumb|left|Verbos]]
The arts and crafts at the fair include hand-made goods from local craftsmen, such as woven and [[knitting|knitted]] clothes, footwear, toys, [[food utensil|utensils]], pots and jugs, jewelry, souvenirs, and paintings. Traditional foodstuffs include [[rye bread]], [[bublik]]s, [[gingerbread]], natural honey, beer, [[kvass|gira]], and colorfully wrapped [[hard candy]]. Crafts represented include wood carvers, [[blacksmith]]s, potters, weavers and knitters, [[wicker]] weavers.&lt;ref name=travel/&gt;

[[Easter palm]]s ({{lang-lt|verbos}}) are one of the fair's specialties. They are made of colourful dried wild flowers and herbs (about 150 different varieties of plants are used) tied around a wooden stick.&lt;ref name=dumal/&gt; Traditionally, they were taken to churches on [[Palm Sunday]]. Verba has become a traditional symbol of spring and Easter. However, it is an endangered craft.&lt;ref name=dumal/&gt; Making ''verba'' is difficult and time-consuming process. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find flowers and herbs or special dies to color them. The buyers are wary that the dried plants would cause allergic reactions.&lt;ref name=dumal/&gt;

Another signature product at the fair is the Casimir's Heart, a heart-shaped [[gingerbread]] decorated with sugar patterns and figures (flowers, zigzags, birds, etc.) or popular given names. People buy them to give to their loved ones. It is customary to bring back some these to those who could not attend.

'''''Kong Renés Datter''''' (''King René’s Daughter'') is a [[Danish language|Danish]] verse drama written in 1845 by [[Henrik Hertz]]. It is a fictional account of the early life of [[Yolande, Duchess of Lorraine|Yolande of Lorraine]], daughter of [[René of Anjou]], in which she is depicted as a beautiful blind sixteen-year-old princess who lives in a protected garden paradise. The play was highly popular in the 19th century. It was translated into many languages, copied, parodied and adapted. The Russian adaptation by Vladimir Zotov was used as the basis for the 1892 opera ''[[Iolanta]]'', written by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], with libretto by his brother [[Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wheeler | first = Victor |authorlink = | title = Dicapo Opera – Tchaikovsky’s Iolanta | work =  | publisher = www.classicalsource.com | year = 2011 | url = http://classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=9810  | accessdate  = 2011-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the central character is given as "[[Iolanthe (disambiguation)|Iolanthe]]" in the original and in early English versions.

==Characters==
*King René of Naples, Count of Provence
*Iolanthe, his daughter
*Tristan, Count of Vaudémont
*Sir Geoffrey of Orange, Tristan's friend
*Sir Almerick, a knight in René's court
*Ebn Jahia, a Moorish physician 
*Bertrand, guardian of Iolanthe's garden
*Martha, his wife

==Plot==
At the entrance to a hidden garden in a beautiful Provençal valley Bertrand explains to Almerick that no one must be allowed to enter because the king's daughter Iolanthe is living there in seclusion. The fact that she is blind has been kept secret from all but a few confidants; it has been put out that she is living in a convent. Even Iolanthe herself does not understand that she is blind because no one is allowed to speak to her of light or colour. Nor does she know she is a princess. She was blinded in an accident in infancy and has been attended ever since by the Moorish physician Ebn Jahia, who every day places her in an enchanted sleep and attends to her eyes while she is unconscious. With a combination of medication, magic and astrology, he has predicted that she will be cured when she is 16. This is also when she is due to marry Tristan, Count of Vaudémont, who is unaware of her condition. Iolanthe has just passed her 16th birthday. Martha says that Iolanthe has grown up happy, spending her time in song and poetry, and that she will not be able to understand what sight is. Almerick says that he has been sent to inform Bertrand that the king and the physician will be arriving shortly and that Count Tristan is on his way to Provence to marry Iolanthe.

King René and Ebn Jahia arrive. They discuss Iolanthe's cure. Ebn Jaha says that Iolanthe should soon be able to see, but first she must be told that she is blind and made to understand what sight is. René does not want his daughter's happiness to be broken, so is unwilling to violate Iolanthe's innocence. Ebn Jahia explains that the body and the spirit are intertwined, insisting that Iolanthe must be psychologically prepared for sight. King René agonises over his decision, while Ebn Jahia places Iolanthe in a sleep using a magical amulet. They leave.

Geoffrey and Tristan arrive at the gate. They enter the garden. Tristan tells Geoffrey that he does not want to marry a woman he has never seen; indeed he hates the thought of it. He is only willing to do so from a sense of duty. They enter the garden marvelling at its beauty. Tristan sees the sleeping Iolanthe and immediately falls in love with her. Geoffrey thinks he has been enchanted. Tristan picks up the amulet. He prepares to leave, but Iolanthe wakes, calling for Bertrand and Martha. Geoffrey and Tristan introduce themselves and Iolanthe makes them a drink. The three young people sing troubadour songs to each other. Tristan asks Geoffrey to bring their troops to guard the pass giving entrance to the valley. Geoffrey leaves. Iolanthe and Tristan talk together. He discovers she is blind when she fails to distinguish a white from a red rose. He tries to explain light and colour to her, but she cannot understand him. He declares his love for her and says he will find her father and ask him for her hand in marriage. He leaves.

Iolanthe tells Bertrand and Martha that a mysterious stranger has been there and awakened in her confusing new ideas and feelings. René and Ebn Jahia arrive. René realises he must now explain to Iolanthe what blindness is. He tries to do so. Iolanthe is perplexed, but Ebn Jahia says that the cure can now be successfully completed. He leads Iolanthe away. Almerick arrives with a letter from Tristan stating that he can no longer marry Iolanthe as he has found his true love. René is astounded. Tristan and Geoffrey arrive wearing armour. They say their army has taken control of the valley. They demand to know who René is. He tells them he is the king. Tristan states that he loves the girl who lives in the garden. René explains that she is Iolanthe, his own daughter and Tristan's fiancée. Iolanthe and Ebn Jahia return. She is cured. Everyone rejoices.

==Background==
The story is based on the life of [[Yolande, Duchess of Lorraine|Yolande]], daughter of King [[René of Anjou]], who married her cousin [[Frederick II, Count of Vaudémont]] in 1445. The marriage was a dynastic alliance, arranged to end the dispute which existed between René of Anjou and Frederick's father, [[Antoine of Vaudémont]], regarding the succession to the Duchy of Lorraine. Beyond these facts, the play is fictional. The Count of Vaudémont's given name is altered to "Tristan". The central conceit of Iolanthe's blindness is entirely invented.

Subjects related to the court of René were familiar in the Romantic and Victorian period. René had been idealised in the Romantic era as a poet-king, whose court in Provence was a genteel haven of literature, architecture and art in a violent era. This image was first popularised in [[Walter Scott]]'s 1829 novel ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Baring-Gould, ''In Troubadour-land: A Ramble in Provence and Languedoc'', 1891, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and adaptations==
[[File:Maude Fealy - King Rene's Daughter.jpg|thumb|poster for the 1913 film]]
The portrayal of Yolande in Hertz's play as a saintly dreaming beauty (regularly placed in an entranced sleep by the physician) was immensely popular.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;!-- When/where was Hertz's play produced?  How frequently was it revived?  There needs to be a discussion of the Danish productions here. --&gt; The play was translated into other languages.

There were several English translations, including by Jane Frances Chapman (1845) and [[Theodore Martin]] (1850).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Theodore. ''King René's daughter: a Danish lyrical drama'', W. Crosby and H.P. Nichols, 1850; [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1k4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA460&amp;dq=iolanthe+hertz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=quQKT4yOKJP78QOX2-DfDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=iolanthe%20hertz&amp;f=false Review of Chapman's translation], ''Christian Examiner'', Volume 8; Volume 43, 1847, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; The heroine's name was retained from the original as "Iolanthe". The piece was produced in London several times, including at the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] in 1849; later by [[Charles Kean]] at the [[Haymarket Theatre]]; and in 1876 at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] by [[Henry Irving]]'s company in Martin's version, starring [[Helena Faucit|Helena Faucit Martin]] in the title role and Irving as Count Tristan.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Ellen Terry's Benefit", ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 23 May 1880, p. 6; and [http://www.henryirving.co.uk/correspondence_subject.php?pageNum_rs_corr=16&amp;totalRows_rs_corr=491&amp;subject=6 Correspondence of Henry Irving], 6 June 1876, Henry Irving Foundation Centenary Project website, accessed 12 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  A version of the play adapted by [[W.G. Wills]] was performed by Irving's company at the Lyceum in 1880 under the title "Iolanthe", starring [[Ellen Terry]] in the title role and Irving as Count Tristan.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Ellen Terry's Benefit", ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 23 May 1880, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; An unrelated 1882 [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera was titled ''[[Iolanthe]]'' after Gilbert asked his producer, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], to request Irving's permission for use of the name.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, Michael. ''Gilbert and Sullivan &amp;ndash; A Dual Biography'', Oxford University Press (2002), p. 212; and [[Ian Bradley|Bradley, Ian]]. ''The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan'', Oxford University Press (1996), p. 364. Neither source records whether Irving ever responded.&lt;/ref&gt; A musical version of the play itself had already been created in 1871 as a [[cantata]] by [[Henry Smart]], setting a verse adaptation by Frederick Enoch.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, George P. ''The Standard Cantatas'', Echo, 2010 (reprint of 1888 edition), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Rene's daughter musical.jpg|thumb|left|The front page of the score for Edwards' 1893 musical.]]
The Russian translation was by Fyodor Miller. An adaptation by Vladimir Zotov expanded the plot. This version was used as the basis for the opera ''[[Iolanta]]'', written by Tchaikovsky to a libretto by his brother, Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It received its premiere on 18 December 1892 in St. Petersburg. In this version much of the magical material in the original is eliminated, making Ebn Jahia more of a scientist than sorcerer. A new character, Robert, Duke of Burgundy, is introduced to replace Geoffrey. Robert becomes Iolanthe's original unwilling fiancé, who happily relinquishes Iolanthe to his friend Vaudémont.

In 1893 a new musical version of the drama, by the [[light opera]] composer [[Julian Edwards]], was published in America and performed with limited success on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Edwards, ''King René's Daughter, a lyric drama'', John Church, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Julian Edwards, A Composer of Light Opera who has recently become famous", ''Lewiston Evening Journal'', 30 October 1896, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 a silent film of Hertz's play was made by the [[Thanhouser Company]], starring [[Maude Fealy]] as Iolanthe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thanhouser.org/films/king_rene.htm ''King's Rene's Daughter'', Thanhouser films .]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also adapted in 1990 as the German film ''Das Licht der Liebe''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zweitausendeins.de/filmlexikon/?wert=16242&amp;sucheNach=titel Das Licht der Liebe (1990)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake Peigneur''' (locally pronounced {{IPA|[pæ̃j̃æ̹ɾ]}}) is a saline&lt;ref group=upper-alpha name=salinity/&gt; lake in the US state of [[Louisiana]], {{convert|1.2|mi|km|1}} north of [[Delcambre, Louisiana|Delcambre]] and {{convert|9.1|mi|km|1}} west of [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]], near the northernmost tip of [[Vermilion Bay (Louisiana)|Vermilion Bay]]. With a maximum depth of {{convert|200|ft|m|0}}, it is the deepest lake in Louisiana.

It was a {{convert|10|ft|m|0|sing=on}} deep [[freshwater]] body, popular with sportsmen, until an unusual man-made disaster on November 20, 1980 changed its structure and the surrounding land.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/waters/tmdldocs/FTNLakePeigneur.pdf |title=Lake Peigneyr TMDLS for dissolved oxygen and nutrients |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] |type=Report |year=2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924143856/https://www.epa.gov/waters/tmdldocs/FTNLakePeigneur.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="v"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.versatel.nl/the_sims/rig/lakepeigneur.htm |title=Lake Peigneur - Oil rig disasters - Offshore Drilling Rig Accidents |accessdate=2017-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912140512/http://home.versatel.nl/the_sims/rig/lakepeigneur.htm |archivedate=2016-09-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drilling disaster==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--many paragraphs without citations--&gt;
[[File:Lake Peigneur Waterfall.png|thumb|right|The backwards flow of the normally outflowing [[Delcambre Canal]] temporarily created the biggest [[waterfall]] in [[Louisiana]]]]
On Thursday, November 20, 1980, an [[Oil platform|oil rig]] contracted by [[Texaco]] accidentally drilled into the [[Cargill|Diamond Crystal Salt Company]] [[salt mine]] under the lake.  Because of an incorrect or misinterpreted [[coordinate reference system]] (the rig was positioned as if the coordinates were in the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]] when, in actuality, they were in [[transverse Mercator projection]]{{Citation needed|reason=Not described in any of the sources|date=April 2017}}) the {{convert|14|in|cm|sing=on}} drill bit entered the mine, starting a chain of events that turned the lake from freshwater to salt-water, with a deep hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alan |last=Bellows |url=http://www.damninteresting.com/lake-peigneur-the-swirling-vortex-of-doom/ |title=Lake Peigneur: The Swirling Vortex of Doom |publisher=Damninteresting.com |date=2005-09-06 |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to determine what occurred, as much evidence was destroyed or washed away in the ensuing [[maelstrom]]. Eventually, it was determined that a miscalculation by Texaco about their location resulted in the drill puncturing the roof of the third level of the mine. This created an opening in the bottom of the lake. The lake then drained into the hole, expanding the size of that hole as the soil and salt were washed into the mine by the rushing water, filling the enormous caverns that had been left by the removal of salt since 1919.

The resultant [[whirlpool]] sucked in the drilling platform, eleven barges, many trees and {{convert|65|acre|ha}} of the surrounding terrain. So much water drained into those caverns that the flow of the [[Delcambre Canal]] that usually empties the lake into [[Vermilion Bay (Louisiana)|Vermilion Bay]] was reversed, making the canal a temporary inlet. This backflow created for a few days the tallest [[waterfall]] ever in the state of Louisiana, at {{convert|164|ft|m|0}}, as the lake refilled with salty water from the Delcambre Canal and Vermilion Bay. Air displaced by the water flowing into the mine caverns erupted through the mineshafts as compressed air and then later as {{convert|400|ft|m|sing=on}} [[geyser]]s.

Although there were no injuries and no human lives lost, three dogs were reported killed. All 55 employees in the mine at the time of the accident were able to escape thanks to well-planned and rehearsed evacuation drills, while the crew of the drilling rig fled the platform before it was sucked down into the new depths of the lake; a fisherman who was on the lake at the time was able to pilot his small boat to shore and escape. Days after the disaster, once the water pressure equalized, nine of the eleven sunken [[barge]]s popped out of the whirlpool and refloated on the lake's surface.

===Aftermath===
[[Texaco]] and the drilling contractor Wilson Brothers paid $32&amp;nbsp;million to Diamond Crystal and $12.8&amp;nbsp;million to a nearby [[plant nursery]], Live Oak Gardens, in [[out-of-court settlement]]s to compensate for the damage caused. The mine was finally closed in December 1986.

Since 1994, [[AGL Resources]] has used Lake Peigneur's underlying [[salt dome]] as a [[AGL Resources#Jefferson Island Storage &amp; Hub|storage and hub facility]] for pressurized natural gas.&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;[http://www.aglresources.com/about/jish_qa.aspx Jefferson Island Storage and Hub Q &amp; A] AGL resources, 2007, (map of lake showing current and planned gas caverns)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a"&gt;

===Salinity===
The lake had salty water&lt;!-- it *had* salt water in 1980, but what is its salinity in 2007? --&gt; after the event, not as a result of salt from the mine dissolving into the water, but from the inflow of salty water from the Delcambre Canal and Vermilion Bay, which are naturally salty or [[brackish]]. The event permanently affected the [[ecosystem]] of the lake by changing the lake from freshwater to saltwater and increasing the depth of part of the lake.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7738">The term '''Lehman Wave''' refers to an economy-wide fluctuation in production and economic activity, with a wavelength of between 12 and 18 months, driven by a sudden major disruption of the economic system. The Lehman Wave is a damped, wave-like fluctuation around equilibrium. The amplitude of the Lehman Wave is larger for a business that is further away from its end market than for a business that is closer to its end market, which difference is caused by cumulative de-stocking of the intermediate supply chain. 
This term Lehman Wave has first been used by Dutch researchers in 2009&lt;ref&gt;[https://business.uc.edu/content/dam/business/departments/oba/seminar-sereis/2010-2011/seminar_20110218_Fransoo.pdf Responding to the Lehman Wave: Sales Forecasting and Supply Management during the Credit Crisis], http://beta.ieis.tue.nl/node/1502 , by Robert Peels, Maximiliano Udenio, Jan C. Fransoo, Marcel Wolfs, Tom Hendrikx published by technical University Eindhoven.&lt;/ref&gt; who gave that name to the economic wave that started in September 2008. They argue that the latter was caused by global de-stocking after the financial panic following the [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008. The Lehman Wave can have strong effects on the sales volume and therefore on the profitability of companies that are located upstream in the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.european-coatings.com/Editorial-archive/Lehman-Wave-shakes-the-coating-industry Lehman Wave shakes the Coating Industry], http://www.european-coatings.com, by Robert Peels, Maximiliano Udenio, Jan C. Fransoo, Marcel Wolfs, Tom Hendrikx, Dimitri de Vreeze, European Coatings Journal, April 2004, p 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism ==
The strong dip in the manufacturing industry seen at the end of 2008 was caused by cumulative and synchronized [[active destocking]], triggered by the [[bankruptcy]] of [[Lehman Brothers]]. Said [[bankruptcy]] created a sudden peak in the [[Libor]] interest rate, causing banks to recall credit and companies to start freeing up cash by reducing [[stocks]]. End markets also responded by going down, but much slower and in most markets not so strongly. The de-stocking created a giant [[damped wave]], the so-called "Lehman wave". 
 [[File:Lehman Wave curve and economic cycle curve.jpg|right|thumb|400px|''Fig 1: Red curve is the Lehman Wave as a fluctuation around the equilibrium, in this simplified example the black line represents the longer term economic cycle.'']]

==Compared with other business cycles==
The cyclic pattern of the Lehman Wave can be modelled explicitly since it is the consequence of mechanical behavior of [[stocks]] and flows. The Lehman Wave is presumed to have a wave-like character because of the elasticity of the supply chains in which it takes place. Each individual supply chain acts as a [[wikt:string|string]] that is oscillating. All supply chains together form the economy, which also oscillates. The wave character of the Lehman Wave makes it possible to predict its cause.

==Active and re-active destocking ==
Active and re-active destocking explains why some companies can see a strong dip in sales while their end markets are fairly stable. If the supply chain between a company and its end-customer would have a [[stock depth]] of "250 days' sales", meaning that it takes at least 250 days for a molecule to travel from a companies' warehouse to the end consumer, and if each firm in such a 250-day supply chain decides to do [[active destocking]] of 12%, an amount of stock equal to 30 days' sales (a whole month) is taken out of the chain. For a company at the beginning of the supply chain this will result in either a business standstill for a whole month or a 33% decline during three months.
This discovery of active destocking, [[reactive destocking]] and the Lehman Wave can have important implications for manufacturing scheduling, inventory management, work force management and budgeting.&lt;ref name="implications"&gt;{{cite web|work=About.com |title=Financial Careers|url=http://financecareers.about.com/od/jp/g/Lehman_Wave.htm|author=Mark Kolakowski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the bullwhip effect==
While the existence of the [[bullwhip effect]] has been extensively documented (e.g., Forrester (1961),&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, J.W. (1961), Industrial Dynamics. Cambridge: MIT Press, and New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Sterman (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, J.D. (1989), Modeling Managerial Behavior: Misperceptions of Feedback in a Dynamic Decision Making Experiment, Management Science 35:3, 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lee et al. (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H.L., V. Padmanabhan, and S. Whang (1997), Information Distortion in a Supply Chain: The Bullwhip Effect, Management Science, 43:4, 546-558.&lt;/ref&gt;) Croson and Donohue (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Croson, R., and K. Donohue (2006), Behavioral causes of the bullwhip effect and the observed value of inventory information, Management Science, 52:3, 323-336.&lt;/ref&gt; there have been arguments about its existence in the overall economy or in supply chains encompassing numerous companies. Cachon et al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Cachon, G.P., T. Randall, and G.M. Schmidt (2007), In Search of the Bullwhip Effect, Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management 9:4, 457-479.&lt;/ref&gt; recently argued that no evidence of the existence of the bullwhip effect could be found. Fransoo and Wouters (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Fransoo, J.C., and M.J.F. Wouters (2000), Measuring the bullwhip effect in the supply chain, Supply Chain Management: An International Journal 5:2, 78-89&lt;/ref&gt; and Chen and Lee (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Chen, L., and H.L. Lee (2009), Information Sharing and Order Variability Control Under a Generalized Demand Model, Management Science 55:5, 781-797.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that in order to observe the bullwhip effect it is crucial to measure it correctly. Both these papers argue that improper aggregation essentially takes away the opportunity to observe the bullwhip effect. In the [[beer distribution game]] (Sterman, 1989), the bullwhip effect is created by a single pulse. In Sterman's experiment, this single pulse is an increase in the demand level. In the case of the Lehman Wave that started in September 2008 the single pulse is a synchronized decrease in the target inventory level along the entire [[supply chain]]. A reduction of inventories under stable or slightly decreasing sales can only be achieved if purchases are reduced or postponed. As a consequence of the decision to reduce inventory, therefore, many companies substantially reduced their purchases of supplies or raw materials. Obviously, companies further upstream in the supply chain were hit more than companies downstream. So the Lehman Wave can be described as a synchronized bullwhip.

==Relationship with debates in economics==
In economics, there has been an ongoing debate whether inventory smoothes production or whether it act as an accelerator of business cycles. Feldstein and Auerbach (1976)&lt;ref&gt;Feldstein, M., and M. Auerbach (1976), Inventory Behavior in Durable-Goods Manufacturing: The Target-Adjustment Model, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, No 2., 351-408.&lt;/ref&gt; note that "rarely [does] a study of inventory behavior fail[s] to note that some 75 percent of the cyclical downturn in gross national product from peak to trough can be accounted for by the reduction of business inventories". Theoretical explanations of the inventory accelerator effect list aspects of the Lehman Wave phenomenon, such as delay in adjusting forecasts, but do not capture the essential layered structure of the supply chain. The latter is a novelty in the reasoning behind the Lehman Wave theory.

'''James Leslie Robert Long''' (21 February 1915 – 12 April 1944), known as '''Cookie''', was a British [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber pilot who was taken prisoner during the [[Second World War]]. He took part in the 'Great Escape' from [[Stalag Luft III]] in March 1944, but was one of the men re-captured and subsequently [[Stalag Luft III murders|murdered]] by the ''[[Gestapo]]''.

==Pre-war life==
Long grew up in Somerset where his father owned a large grocery store, he was educated at [[Taunton]]. His father was a senior member of the [[Octagon Chapel, Bath|Octagon Chapel]] a congregation of the [[Plymouth Brethren]] and Les Long grew up within the religious community. He was educated at Huish's Grammar School [[Taunton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Wartime-recollection/story-11354773-detail/story.html   BathChronicle Website – JLR Long]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite passing the entrance examination for [[Oxford University]] he was apprenticed to the General Accident Insurance Company to train as an inspector. After an adventurous holiday in Ireland he returned home and joined the [[Civil Air Guard]] determined to get his civil pilots licence. His call up papers were issued soon after war broke out and he applied for the [[Royal Air Force]] to complete his pilot training.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==War service==
On 19 April 1940 Long commenced his service with the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] with service number 922353 and by 24 December 1940 had been promoted to [[Leading Aircraftman]] and awarded his pilot brevet (wings). He was commissioned on 24 December 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35049 |date=21 January 1941 |pages=415–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posted to No. 19 [[Operational Training Unit]] to prepare for operational service with a squadron. 
On 3 March 1941 he was posted to [[No. 9 Squadron RAF]] flying [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers. As a junior pilot he flew as second pilot in experienced crews to gain experience but his operational career was to be short.

==Prisoner of war==
At 19:43 hours on the evening of 27 March 1941 Long took off in a [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington Mark Ic bomber]] (serial number ''R1335'') from [[RAF Honington]] to attack a target at [[Cologne]], Germany. They suffered with engine problems but arrived at the target and bombed but at 2248 that night a message was received that the bomber was having to crash land in the Netherlands, it had been badly shot up by a [[Luftwaffe]] night fighter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aircrewremembered.com/john-talbot-lovell-shore.html  AircrewRemembered Website – Shore &amp; Long]&lt;/ref&gt; The entire crew were made prisoner of war near [[Limbourg]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Chorley (1993), p.34&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a prisoner of war he was interrogated by the Luftwaffe before being sent to [[Stalag Luft I]] [[Barth, Germany|Barth]] where he and his pilot, John Shore, immediately became involved in escape attempts involving tunneling out of the camp during one of which Shore got out and made it home to England via Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt;
Long was one of an initial batch of persistent escapers,&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.63&lt;/ref&gt; who were sent to the new [[Stalag Luft III]] in the province of Lower Silesia near the town of [[Sagan, Germany|Sagan]] (now [[Żagań]] in Poland) on 21 March 1942. He tried to escape during the transfer between camps but was recaptured.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.42&lt;/ref&gt; He was an enthusiastic tunneller,&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976) p.36&lt;/ref&gt; and did much to improve and lengthen tunnel codenamed "Tom".&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.157 and p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

In between tunneling Long studied economics with text books sent from home with a 2-day period of study during enforced bed time after an injury during tunnelling.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.91 and p.190&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Model Stalag Luft III.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Model of Stalag Luft III prison camp.]]
He was promoted to [[flying officer]] on 23 December 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35531 |date=21 April 1942 |pages=1756–1757  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flight lieutenant]] on 23 December 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36004 |date=4 May 1943 |pages=2051–2052  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Great Escape'==
In preparations for the Great Escape operation Long was one of the leading tunnellers. During the escape he made two emergency repairs to the tunnel due to roof falls&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976) pp.42 and p.50 and p.64&lt;/ref&gt; and after breaking out quite late accompanied by [[Tony Bethell]] who was an appointed "marshal", one of the dozen men appointed to wait in the forest after escaping to collect a pre-selected group of ten men who would then be led westwards as initial stage guides&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.245&lt;/ref&gt; Long joined a group known as the "hard arsers" because they planned to walk alone then entire trip homewards rather than catching trains.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.50&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was one of the 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24–25 March 1944 in the escape now famous as "[[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]]" but on the evening of 29 March 1944 Long and [[Tony Bethell]] arrived at [[Görlitz]] prison from Sagan police station where they had been held after recapture. Long's party had become lost in the dense forest and ended up beside the Russian compound of [[Stalag Luft III]] only to be set on the right direction by [[Tony Bethell]] who then teamed up with Long. They made excellent progress after that walking alongside the main railway line to [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] but found the trains travelling to fast to jump aboard.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.50&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 March 1944 they were arrested by German Home Guard and arrived at the collecting point for recaptured officers in Görlitz prison on 29 March 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.244-245&lt;/ref&gt; Regularly groups of officers were taken away by the [[Gestapo]] in a variety of vehicles until just Long and Max Ellis remained at Görlitz&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.267&lt;/ref&gt; They were regularly moved from cell to cell until finally being separated on 11 April 1944.  Ellis saw Long on 12 April 1944 and on 13 April 1944 he asked to borrow Long's comb, but was told by a guard that "he left yesterday".&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.268)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.64&lt;/ref&gt; No trace of Long was ever found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegasusarchive.org/pow/cSL_3_Fifty.htm|work=Pegasus Archive|title=Stalag Luft III: The Fifty|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long was one of the 50 escapers [[Stalag Luft III murders|executed and murdered]] by the ''Gestapo''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flyingforyourlife.com/pilots/ww2/bl/buckles/  Fly for your Life Website – listing of officers murdered]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/article-template-standard.page?doc=commemorating-the-great-escape/hvhsqy96  RCAF Website listing the officers murdered]&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated at Breslau.&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Originally his remains were buried at Sagan, he is now buried in part of the Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2194329/LONG,%20JAMES%20LESLIE%20ROBERT Commonwealth War Graves Commission – Les Long]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:The50Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial to "The Fifty" down the road toward Żagań (Long is on the right)]]
Long was named beside [[Stanislaw Krol]] and [[Pawel Tobolski]] on the supplementary list of prisoners "shot while attempting to escape" which was handed to prisoners at [[Stalag Luft III]] on 18 May 1944, though his name was not in the list of the murdered prisoners which was published in the press in the UK and Commonwealth countries when news broke on or about 20 May 1944.&lt;ref&gt;''Western Morning News'', ''Dundee Courier'', ''Yorkshire Post'', etc. 20 May 1944&lt;/ref&gt; (Post-war investigations saw a number of those guilty of the murders tracked down, arrested and tried for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), pp. 188 and 199&lt;/ref&gt;)

Shortly afterwards, a communication arrived from England to advise Long that he had successfully completed the requirements for a degree of Bachelor of Arts in Economics.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p. 188-189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Reportedly [[Mentioned in despatches]] for bravery as a prisoner of war (none of the other relevant decorations then available could be awarded posthumously). Those awards to his fellow escapers were published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 8 June 1944, but the award to Long cannot be found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36544 | supp=y |date=2 June 1944 |pages=2619–2620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The North of England Education Conference (NEEC)''' was the UK’s biggest annual education conference. The first Conference took place in [[Manchester]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL20289314M/North_of_England_education_conference_1902-1992 "A history of the NEEC Conference 1902 -1992"] Professor Peter Osgood, Leeds University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The event provided an opportunity for senior decision makers in education, Children’s Services, the public sector, associated agencies and organisations to meet and consider the latest thinking and legislation affecting children and young people. In recent years the scope of the conference had expanded to encompass the broader children’s services agenda.

Despite the conference name, delegates attended from across the UK and beyond. In recent years the conference took place outside of the North of England, including [[Belfast]] and [[Cardiff]].
In 2015 the conference was to be hosted in [http://www.educationconferences.co.uk Manchester] between 14–16 January but was cancelled and has not been held since.
==Delegates==

Within recent years the focus of the conference had expanded. Whilst still having education at its core, a broader children’s agenda was embraced.  Attendees included Directors of Education, key elected members, headteachers, school governors, those engaged in research in Higher Education and partners from Health, Police and Voluntary Sector organisations.

==Speakers==

The conference attracted high-profile speakers and notably the appropriate Secretary of State. This has included in recent years [[Ed Balls]], [[Ruth Kelly]], [[David Miliband]], [[David Blunkett]] and [[Estelle Morris]]. The conference was often used as a platform to launch or 'sound out' changes in policy or legislation. Hosting authorities often worked in collaboration with local universities and colleges to tap into national and international expertise and research.

==Venues==

Historically the Conference has taken place each January and has alternated in venue between the east and west of the [[Pennines]]. On occasion however, the Conference has been held outside the North of England. In 2004 the NEEC was held in [[Northern Ireland]] in [[Belfast]] and in 2008, the NEEC paid its first visit to [[Wales]] and [[Cardiff]].  In January 2014 the last conference was held in [[Nottingham]]. 

==Development==

Reflecting changes in recent years in the delivery of services to children, young people and families the conference focus had begun to reflect the wider children’s agenda encapsulated in ''[[Every Child Matters|Every Child Matters: Change for Children]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/ "Every Child Matters Agenda"] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101220152656/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/ |date=20 December 2010 }}  Labour Government Paper enshrining the Children Act 2004 (retrieved 31 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the conference continued to provide high-profile speakers with an education focus, it had recently included speakers from other areas of the children’s workforce such as health, the police, business and the [[Voluntary sector|Third Sector]]. However the event, which generations of education policymakers viewed as a key moment of the year, now appears to be a thing of the past and by the time Michael Gove took over as education secretary in 2010, it was an event he was quite happy to miss, choosing to make major announcements elsewhere. No minister was due to appear in 2015.

==Governance==

The NEEC operated under the governance formed by its membership as part of the North of England Education Conference Association. This is defined as ''"Those English Local Authorities within the Government Office areas for the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, and also the higher education institutions lying in this area".'' Representatives from the host authority, their predecessor and the following years host were represented in the governance.

==Involvement of children and young people==

A strong feature of the conference is the involvement of children and young people. Traditionally involved in artistic, musical and dramatic performance they had begun to play a wider role in the content of the programme. In January 2012 Blackpool had a young person co-preside over the conference for the first time along with President, [[Ann Widdecombe]]. In [[Nottingham]] in 2014 there was a separate Youth Conference running alongside the main event run by young people from the eight Core Cities.

==History of the Conference==

In 1902, having seen the success of a conference for science teachers in London,  JH Reynolds, Manchester City Council's Director of Technical Instruction, decided to replicate the conference in his home town. The conference, also with a science theme, was arranged for 2 and 3 January 1903 and attended by 3,200 teachers, lecturers, inspectors and local government employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=373229 "Best wishes to our friend in the North"] Times Educational Supplement, 3 January 2003, Alison Brace - Article on the History of the NEEC on its 100th anniversary (retrieved 31 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Built on this success the conference widened the agenda to cover all areas of the curriculum. With short input from a range of professionals the, conference has remained true to the original template and remained a fixture in the first week of the year.
 
In 1924 the political dimension was added and the Secretary of the State of the day has usually been in attendance ever since, the conference often serving as a platform for announcement to changes in legislation or educational approaches. Over the course of its history this has included: [[Anthony Crosland]], [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]], [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[Shirley Williams]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102083 "Speech to North of England Education Conference"], 6 Jan 1971, Margaret Thatcher&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Clarke, on assuming his post as Secretary of State, is reported to have been told it was the one conference he could not afford to miss.

[[Image:Rue Card-Lemoine-Paradis-Latin.JPG|thumb|Theater Paradis Latin]]
The '''Paradis Latin''' is a theater at number 28, rue du Cardinal Lemoine, in the [[Latin Quarter]] of [[Paris]], in the fifth arrondissement, near Notre-Dame, the Panthéon, and the [[Tour d'Argent]] restaurant. The closest métro stations are [[Cardinal Lemoine (Paris Métro)|Cardinal Lemoine]] and [[Jussieu (Paris Métro)|Jussieu]]. 
 
It was first built on the rue des Fosses-Saint-Victor in 1803 and called Théâtre Latin. It burned down in 1870, but was rebuilt on the rue du Cardinal Lemoine, as Paradis Latin in 1887–1889 by [[Gustave Eiffel]]. It was closed around 1900, but was rehabilitated, starting in 1973, and reopened, in 1977, as a cabaret.

==History==
Paradis Latin goes back to 1802, when the First Consul [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] built the Latin Theater, on the rue des [[:fr:Fossés Saint-Victor|Fossés-Saint-Victor]], and opened in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;https://eldiariodelamarina.com/le-paradis-latin-paris-philippe-auguste-machiavel-1201-1899/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, the Latin Theater became one of the highlights of the Parisian nights where artists, bourgeois, writers, poets, journalists, politicians, intellectuals, students, workers, merchants, aristocrats ... [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Alexandre Dumas fils]] and [[Prosper Mérimée]] were regulars. It was destroyed by a fire during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, when Prussian Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] besieged Paris. Its ruins remained for 17 years.

In 1887, during the preparation of the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exhibition of 1889]], [[Gustave Eiffel]] reconstructed the theater at the same time as his tower. The new hall was inaugurated on Sunday, January 20, 1889, under the name of Paradis Latin, and was a complete poster every night, presenting revues and ballets. The year of the Exposition was a happy year for the Parisian show with among others: the Mandrake, a very acclaimed piece whose heroine of the evening was [[Yvette Guilbert]] ([[:fr:Yvette Guilbert|fr]]), immortalized by [[Toulouse Lautrec]], who for several months was the star of the Song, and would become the interpreter of the composer [[Léon Xanrof]].

As a direct competitor to Paradis Latin, cafés-concerts, more numerous than ever, all gave the same stereotyped spectacle. There was a beginning of the songs which invariably produced in front of the public, the comic-troupier, the poivrot, the gummeuse, the peasant comic, the patriotic singer. The directors of Paradis Latin then had the idea to call on acrobats, balancers, jugglers, contortionists, Chinese shadow-makers to complete and enrich their show. The new formula held only a few seasons. 

In 1894, the great hall of the Paradis Latin closed its doors. Only the brasserie, starring Chopinette, a pupil of [[Bruant]]([[:fr:Bruant|fr]]) but with neither talent nor authority, and his clientele, largely made of students, did not allow him to survive beyond 1903. The immense location became a warehouse.

At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Montmartre]] is now the fashionable district of Paris. The Paradis Latin suffers from this displacement and becomes an industrial area with glassmakers and faience potters who settle there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.francebillet.com/place-spectacle/fichesalle/PARIS-05-PARADIS-LATIN-PARLA.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The glass-maker [[Charles Leune]]([[:fr:Charles Leune|fr]]) bought the place to install his workshop there. In 1930 a pharmaceutical company acquired it but left the place unoccupied for a long time.

==1970s==
In 1973, the real estate developer [[Jean Kriegel]]([[:fr:Jean Kriegel|fr]]) bought the building at 28 and 28 bis rue de Cardinal Lemoine to rehabilitate the old building into apartments. Visiting the premises, he goes from room to room, and from surprise to surprise. Eighteen thousand pipettes and other stills litter the ground, abandoned by its last owner. As the walls and false ceilings are destroyed, the imposing metal structure of Eiffel is revealed, including fragments of posters and scenery, and a Paradis Latin poster. On the first floor, workers uncover an astonishing cathedral, gilt, columns, arches, capitals and a glorious painted cupola. After discovering the theater and seduced by the place, he decided to resurrect the 720-seat cabaret according to Eiffel's original plans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paradislatin.com/fr/histoire/la-legende&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paradislatin.com/en/histoire/la-legende&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://staging.paradislatin.fr/en/history/the-legend&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Marie Rivière]]([[:fr:Jean-Marie Rivière|fr]]), artistic director, assisted by the author [[Frédéric Botton]]([[:fr:Frédéric Botton|fr]]), presented the first Paris Paradis show on November 14, 1977, which was a triumph. The Latin Paradise has since regained its status as a high place of the Parisian nights.

In 1979 two years after the opening of ''Paris Paradis,'' [[Jean-Jacques Debout]]([[:fr:Jean-Jacques Debout|fr]]) and [[Roger Dumas]]([[:fr:Roger Dumas|fr]]) created the ''Nuit de Paradis'' show for Jean-Marie Rivière.
In 1981 a new show, ''Paradisiac,'' was produced and directed by [[Frédéric Botton]] ([[:fr:Frédéric Botton|fr]]) and [[Francis Lai]]([[:fr:Francis Lai|fr]]), who took a leave from his musical and film career for the project. 

[[Thierry Paulin]]([[:fr:Thierry Paulin|fr]]), [[Jean-Thierry Mathurin]]([[:fr:Jean-Thierry Mathurin|fr]]), and the artist [[Michel Berger]]([[:fr:Michel Berger|fr]]) got their start at the theater. [[Arturo Brachetti]]([[:fr:Arturo Brachetti|fr]]), considered the best quick change performer in the world, started his career at Paradis Latin in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brachetti.com|title=ARTURO BRACHETTI - Official Site|author=|date=|website=ARTURO BRACHETTI|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only one in the world since the legendary [[Leopoldo Fregoli]] (1867-1937).

The artistic director, Jean-Marie Rivière, eventually retired to the [[Antilles]], but the theater continued. New shows followed, co-written and directed by [[Christian Dura]] ([[:fr:|fr]]): ''Champagne'' in 1984, then ''Hello Paradis'' in 1987, and ''Viva Paradis,'' which commemorates the hundredth anniversary of the theater.
In May 1995, a few years after the departure of his former colleague Riviére, Jean Kriegel chose to retire as well. Over nearly twenty years, he had hosted some two million spectators, with six different shows and over 1600 performances.

Management has since been transferred to Sidney Israel and his son Harold.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatreonline.com/Theatre/Paradis-Latin/518&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ragam'''  is the annual inter-college fest conducted by the [[National Institute of Technology, Calicut]]. Ragam blends a series of fine-arts, socio-cultural and literary events, along with a variety of workshops, exhibitions and informal events. The fest attracts thousands of visitors to the campus annually, and is one of the biggest cultural fests in India.

==History==
Over two decades have passed since the inception of Ragam. The humble yet controversial beginnings of this festival are well-known due to the famous [[Rajan case]] that rocked Kerala in the seventies. Rajan, a student of the then-CREC was taken into police custody during the Emergency period and allegedly died in custody in 1976. In 1977 the All Kerala Rajan memorial music competition was started to commemorate his life. However, the same got discontinued in a few years. Later in 1987 the fest resurfaced as Ragam, an inter-college cultural fest in remembrance of Rajan. The prestigious ever-rolling Ragam trophy of "Nataraj", the trophy awarded to the overall champions at the fest, is considered as one of the most coveted prizes by the colleges in South India. The 31st edition of the fest was conducted in March 2017. The 32nd edition of Ragam was held from 23-25 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/260318/curtains-down-for-nit-c-ragam-2018.html|title=Curtains down for NIT-C Ragam 2018|date=26 March 2018|work=Deccan Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pro Shows==
The Ragam pro-shows have always been noted for the celebrities who have performed at NIT Calicut. The shows are staged in the institute OAT (Open Air Theatre), with a capacity of over 6000 spectators. Presently the Ragam "nites" include four cultural nites - ‘the inaugural nite’, ‘the highlight pro-show’, ‘the popular nite’ and ‘the rock show nite’.

[[Benny Dayal]], [[Naresh Iyer]], [[Ranjith]], [[Suraj Jagan]] and many more have taken the stage for the ‘Popular nite’, where a group of two or more singers perform for the crowds.

Notable bands that have visited the fest in the past are [[Parikrama]], [[Silk Route]], Whitenoise and [[Motherjane]] along with tribute bands like Higher-on-maiden, Breathe the Floyd and Jail break. In 2011, Ragam witnessed a breathtaking performance by the 'Jai Ho' team. In 2009 Ragam became the first stage in Kerala to host a foreign band, with Breathe the Floyd, a tribute band to Pink Floyd.
In 2015 Ragam truly went international, with Swiss folk metal band [[Eluveitie]] performing for the 'nite'. Sunburn Campus featuring DJ Diego Miranda for the first time in India took Ragam to new heights.

{{Campaignbox First Italian War of Independence}}

The '''Republic of San Marco''' ({{lang-it|Repubblica di San Marco}}), an [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|Italian revolutionary state]], existed for 17 months in 1848–1849. Based on the [[Venetian Lagoon]], it extended into most of [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]], or the ''[[Domini di Terraferma|Terraferma]]'' territory of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], suppressed 51 years earlier in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. After [[declaration of independence|declaring independence]] from the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Austrian Empire]], the republic later joined the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in an attempt, led by the latter, to unite [[northern Italy]] against foreign (mainly Austrian but also French) domination. But the [[First Italian War of Independence]] ended in the defeat of Sardinia, and Austrian forces reconquered the Republic of San Marco on 28 August 1849 following a long siege.

==History==

===Background===
After existing as an independent [[maritime republic]] for  1101 years and a [[thalassocracy|leading naval power]] in the Mediterranean for most of that time, the [[Republic of Venice]] surrendered to [[Napoleon]] during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1797 and was ceded to the Austrian Empire (as the [[kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]) by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] a few months later.  This was confirmed by the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]].

Austrian rule, after realising that mutually-agreeable [[home rule]] would not be possible, exploited Venetian resources, economically and politically, favouring [[Trieste]] as the imperial seaport.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"&gt;{{citation | first = Ronald S | last = Cunsolo | url = http://www.ohiou.edu/~Chastain/rz/venrev.htm | title = Venice and the Revolution of 1848–49 | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848 | accessdate = 22 November 2008 | publisher = Ohio University | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081220140052/http://www.ohiou.edu/~Chastain/rz/venrev.htm | archivedate = 20 December 2008 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 50 years of their acquisition of the former republic, Austria had taken 45 million [[Venetian lira|Austrian lire]] more from the region than had been spent there and Venetian capitalism had been stifled by a reluctance on the part of the slow, bureaucratic Habsburg régime to grant [[credit (finance)|credit]] to Venetian entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848" /&gt; By the end of the 1840s, a collection of intellectuals, urban manufacturers, bankers, merchants and agrarian inhabitants of the ''terra ferma'' were clamouring for political change and greater economic opportunity, albeit only by non-violent means.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt;

Across Italy, discomfort with foreign domination and with [[absolute monarchy]] had led to all Italian states (apart from [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Lombardy–Venetia]]) becoming [[parliamentary monarchy|parliamentary monarchies]] with much of the reform led by [[Pope Pius IX]]. Heavy-handed policing in response to an economic boycott of [[state monopoly|state monopolies]] in Austrian-held [[Milan]] led to the popular expulsion of the Austrian [[garrison]] in the city [[Five Days of Milan|for five days in March 1848]].

Shortly after, the news of [[Revolutions_of_1848_in_the_Austrian_Empire#Revolution_in_the_Austrian_lands|revolt in Vienna]] spreading to Venice lead the city to revolt against the Austrian rule, with the beginnings of Venetian independence.

===Insurrection and independence===
[[File:Sanesi - La proclamazione della Repubblica di San Marco, Marzo 1848 - litografia - ca. 1850.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daniele Manin]] proclaims the Republic of San Marco. [[Lithograph]], dated ''ca.'' 1850]]
A few days after the independence of Milan and Venice and their affiliation to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont–Sardinia]], the Piedmontese army crossed into [[Lombardy]] on 24 March 1848, with the Austrian commander, Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] pulling back to the [[Quadrilatero]], a chain of defensive fortresses between Milan and Venice. Two days previously, [[Daniele Manin]] entered the [[Venetian Arsenal]] with "a number of public-spirited Venetians", in a direct challenge to Austrian rule.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; As the ''Arsenalotti'' detested the Austrian overseers and the Italians in Austrian military service were pro-Venetian, Manin and his supporters moved about at will, unharmed.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; Believing that the timing was favourable, Manin led his followers out of the compound with the cry ''Viva San Marco!'' ({{lang-en|Long Live St. Mark!}})—the [[national motto|motto]] of the defunct Republic of Venice.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; Venetians, if not Austrian officials, accepted this to mean restoration of the old republic.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; With the exception of [[Verona]], garrisoned as part of the Quadrilatero, the cities of Venetia — in particular [[Belluno]], [[Padua]], [[Rovigo]], [[Treviso]], [[Udine]] and [[Vicenza]]&lt;ref name="Manin"/&gt;—immediately sided with the lagoon and rejected Austrian rule, proclaiming Manin president of the Republic of San Marco and investing him with [[dictator]]ial powers during the [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; Manin's leadership was supported by the [[middle class]]es, revealing a permanent change in power from the mercantile [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s of the old republic, and his support of the lower classes, combined with promises of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] to the [[bourgeoisie]], meant his leadership was popular.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; Unfortunately, however, Manin did not have the leadership qualities that might have led to enduring independence.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt;

===Maintaining independence===
King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] had occupied Milan and other Austrian territories with his army. But despite popular support in the [[Papal States]], the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], and [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|the Two Sicilies]] for the Sardinian campaign, he chose to seek [[plebiscite]]s in the occupied territories, rather than  pursuing the retreating Austrians.

Despite enthusiastic support for Sardinia by the revolutionaries (the Republic of San Marco and [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s Milanese volunteers), the Austrians started to regain ground. But the Austrian government was distracted by the [[Vienna Uprising]], the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], and other [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas]]. So Radetzky was instructed to seek a truce, an order he ignored.

While Austria was pressed on every front, the Italians allowed her time to regroup and to reconquer Venice and the other troubled areas of the empire one by one.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt;

Militarily, misreadings of the fluctuating political status in northern Italy—combined with Manin's indecision and ill-health, which confined him to bed at critical moments&lt;ref name="Manin"&gt;Cunsolo, Ronald/ [http://www.ohiou.edu/~Chastain/ip/manin.htm Daniele Manin (1804–1857)], ''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''. Last accessed 23 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;—led to several damaging poor judgements by Venice. The [[Imperial Austrian Navy|Austrian fleet]] was stationed in the formerly-Venetian port of [[Pula|Pola]], in [[Istria]]. Despite Venice having much sympathy there, they made no effort to seize the fleet.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; Similarly, had the Venetians encouraged the desertion of Lombard-Venetian soldiers from the Austrian army, such trained and disciplined troops might have bolstered the Venetian army.

The Venetian revolutionaries also failed to incorporate the ''terra ferma'' (the Venetian mainland) into the lagoon-based republic effectively. While revolutionary reform generated some popular support for the new régime, the revolutionaries recruited few troops there. Mainlanders were mistrustful of Venetian power, probably as a result of old assumptions about the earlier Mariner Republic. This combined with destructive foraging and other damage, which might have been avoided had the revolutionaries recruited across ''terra ferma''.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; While most of the middle and upper classes still supported the fight for independence, the lower classes of ''terra ferma'' were largely indifferent. The Venetian and Lombard troops of Radetzky's army remained mostly loyal and actively fought for Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rassegnastampa.unipi.it/rassegna/archivio/2010/12/08SID3079.PDF The Italians who stayed loyal to the Habsburgs, Gilberto Oneto, 8 December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Mainland recruits could have combined with the 2,000 Papal guards and Neapolitan soldiers under [[Guglielmo Pepe|General Pepe]], who ignored orders to retreat in favor of supporting the infant republics.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt;  But when Austrians under Nugent marched on [[Verona]], and [[Giovanni Durando|General Durando]] led a Piedmontese force to defend, Venice could only supply a few volunteers, later joined by [[Andrea Ferrari (soldier)|Colonel Ferrari]]'s Papal regulars. This was of no avail, as Nugent's force met up with Radetzky's forces and took Verona easily.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt;

[[File:Assedio Venezia Chiesa San Geremia (1849).jpg|thumb|The church of San Geremia in Venice hit by the Austrian bombardment of 1849.]]

Meanwhile, Manin retreated from his republican fervor, for fear of offending Charles Albert; this move was, however, both transparent and ineffectual.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; He also relied on reinforcement by Piedmontese and Papal troops, not understanding that Piedmont would not welcome a powerful republican neighbour when [[Revolutions of 1848|monarchies were under threat across Europe]], or that [[Pope Pius IX]] could not continue to support war between two Catholic monarchs practically on his border.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; After the Italian rout at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 29 July, Charles Albert abandoned Milan. When Radetzky offered its citizens free passage from the city, half the population left.

[[File:5 lire Venezia 1848.jpg|thumb|left|Five [[Venetian lira|Venetian lire]] from the revolutionary republic]]

On 4 July 1848, the Venetian assembly voted 127–6 to approve Manin's proposal of subsumption into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. This lasted only a month, as on 9 August Charles Albert signed an armistice that restored the Piedmontese border at the [[Ticino River]]. At the same time, the Piedmontese navy abandoned its support of Venice.&lt;ref name="Manin"/&gt;

In early October, followers of [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] tried to organize a great republican demonstration, hoping to gain aid from the [[French Second Republic]], convert the city into a centre of Italian liberation, and inspire [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] into an anti-Austrian crusade. But Manin, to avoid offending Charles Albert, suppressed them.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; A "federal congress" was to meet in [[Turin]] on 12 October 1848, and Prime Minister [[Vincenzo Gioberti]] of Piedmont invited Venice to send delegates, but the Venetians declined.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt;  The revolutionary authorities' reaction to Piedmont's declaration of war on Austria illustrated their failure to grasp realities — the Venetian assembly recessed for two weeks.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt;

===Return to Austrian control===
[[File:Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II (Venezia) - Venezia soggiogata - Ettore Ferrari.jpg|thumb|right|The 1887 bronze equestrian monument to [[Victor Emmanuel II]] in Venice, modelled by [[Ettore Ferrari]] (1848–1929), stands on the [[Riva degli Schiavoni]]. The details shows Venice in chains after the defeat in the 1848–49 Revolution. At her side, the Lion of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] in chains.]]
The crushing defeat of Italian forces at the [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Battle of Novara]] (23 March 1849) sounded a death knell for Italian independence from the Austrians.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; To avoid an occupation of Piedmont, Charles Albert [[abdicated]] in favour of his son [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], whose treaty with Austria required the complete removal of the Sardinian navy from Venetian waters.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; Manin addressed the Venetian assembly on 2 April 1849 and they voted to continue their struggle against the Austrians, despite an Austrian [[blockade]] of the city.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; On 4 May 1849, Radetzky started his attack on the Venetian fort of [[Marghera]], held by 2500 troops under the Neapolitan command of [[Girolamo Ulloa]]. Bombardment of the lagoon and city started at the same time and, over the next three weeks alone, {{nowrap|60 000 projectiles}} were dispatched towards Venice.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; The fort at Marghera held out until 26 May, when Ulloa ordered its evacuation; an offer of surrender from Radetzky was rejected at this time.

By August, with [[famine]] and [[cholera]] sweeping the city, Manin proposed that the assembly vote for surrender, threatening to resign if the assembly votes to fight to the last. The assembly, however, agreed, and provided the president with authority to seek terms, which were agreed on 22 August. Radetzky's entrance to Venice on 27 August marked the complete surrender of Venice to the Austrian Empire, restoring the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' and causing Manin to flee Italy, with his family and 39 fellow-revolutionaries, into exile.&lt;ref name="Encyc Rev 1848"/&gt; Manin's wife died of cholera within hours of their departure for Paris.&lt;ref name="Manin"/&gt;

==Leadership  ==
Leadership was effectively provided by Daniele Manin throughout the republic's brief existence, but the following heads of state were in place during the 17 months:&lt;ref name="HHWN"&gt;[http://www.hicon.pl/~pothkan/hhwn/Venice2.html Venetian Republic], ''Historical Handbook of World Navies''.

Duterte studied [[political science]] at the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University]], graduating in 1968, before obtaining a [[law]] degree from [[San Beda College of Law]] in 1972.

==Early life==

Duterte]] (1911–1968), a [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] lawyer, and his mother, [[Soledad Roa-Duterte|Soledad Duterte]] ([[née]] Roa; 1916–2012), was a school teacher from [[Cabadbaran]], [[Agusan del Norte|Agusan]] and a civic leader of [[Maranao people|Maranao]] descent. Duterte's father was mayor of [[Danao, Cebu]], and subsequently the provincial governor of (the then-undivided) [[Davao (province)|Davao province]]. Rodrigo's cousin Ronald was mayor of [[Cebu City]] from 1983 to 1986. Ronald's father, Ramon Duterte, also held the position from 1957 to 1959. The Dutertes consider the Cebu-based [[List of political families in the Philippines|political families]] of the Durano and the Almendras clan as relatives.&lt;ref name="FilipiKnow" /&gt; Duterte also has relatives from the Roa clan in Leyte through his mother's side.&lt;ref name="DuterteZamboTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor Rodrigo Roa Duterte: Leyte's first president?|url=http://www.zamboangatimes.ph/top-news/14939-mayor-rodrigo-roa-duterte-leytes-first-president.html|accessdate=September 13, 2016|work=Daily Zamoanga Times|date=May 20, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306013153/http://www.zamboangatimes.ph/top-news/14939-mayor-rodrigo-roa-duterte-leytes-first-president.html|archivedate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte's family lived in Maasin, and in his father's hometown in Danao, until he was four years old.&lt;ref name="PresidentGovPH"&gt;{{cite web|title=About President Duterte|url=http://president.gov.ph/|website=Office of the President of the Philippines|accessdate=September 14, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708082800/http://president.gov.ph/|archivedate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- There was an earlier supplementary citation of a Rappler.com source, but per an RSN post, that appears to be a social media site or a venue for self-publishing, whose use here violated WP:BLPSPS.

===Education===
Duterte went to Laboon Elementary School in Maasin, for a year.&lt;ref name="DuterteZamboTimes" /&gt; He spent his remaining elementary days at the Santa Ana Elementary School in [[Davao City]], where he graduated in 1956. He finished his secondary education in the High School Department of the then Holy Cross College of Digos (now [[Cor Jesu College]]) in today's city of [[Digos]] in the now defunct [[Davao (province)|Davao province]], after being expelled twice from previous schools, including one in [[Ateneo de Davao University#High School|Ateneo de Davao University (AdDU) High School]] due to misconduct.&lt;ref name="FilipiKnow"&gt;{{cite web|title=17 Things You Didn't Know About Rodrigo Duterte|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/rodrigo-duterte|website=FilipiKnow|accessdate=September 14, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126015106/http://www.filipiknow.net/rodrigo-duterte|archivedate=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1968 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]] at the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University|Lyceum of the Philippines]] in Manila.

Duterte eventually became Special Counsel at the City Prosecution Office in Davao City from 1977–79, Fourth Assistant City Prosecutor from 1979–81, Third Assistant City Prosecutor from 1981–83, and Second Assistant City Prosecutor from 1983–86.

===Sexual Abuse===
Duterte has said that he was [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sexually abused by a priest]] when he was a minor.&lt;ref name="Inquirer-SexuallyAbused"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lacorte|first1=Germelina|title=Duterte names priest who allegedly molested him as teen|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/744824/duterte-names-priest-who-allegedly-molested-him-as-teen|accessdate=December 19, 2016|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=December 4, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308170821/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/744824/duterte-names-priest-who-allegedly-molested-him-as-teen|archivedate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he was challenged by the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] (CBCP) and AdDU officials to name the priest and file a case against him, Duterte then revealed the priest's name as Fr. Mark Falvey, SJ (d. 1975).&lt;ref name="Inquirer-SexuallyAbused" /&gt; The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines]] confirmed that according to press reports in the United States, in May 2007, the Society of Jesus agreed to a tentative payout of USD16 million to settle claims that Falvey sexually abused at least nine children in [[Los Angeles]] from 1959 to 1975. Accusations against Falvey began in 2002, and he was never charged with a crime. Additionally in May 2008, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento|Diocese of Sacramento]] paid $100,000 settlement to a person allegedly raped and molested by Mark's brother, Fr. Arthur Falvey. However, it was not clearly indicated in the report if Mark Falvey was assigned at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Davao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jesuit order paid USD16M to settle Falvey case in US|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/133393/jesuit-order-paid-16m-to-settle-falvey-case-in-us|accessdate=December 17, 2015|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he did not complain when the abuse supposedly happened, Duterte claimed that he was too young to complain about the priest's abuse and was intimidated by authorities at that time.

===Shooting of student at law school===
Duterte stated at a rally in April 2016 that he shot a fellow student who had bullied him about his Visayan origin as well as other students of the same ethnicity, while at San Beda law college. He said "But the truth is, I'm used to shooting people. When we were about to graduate from San Beda, I shot a person." Duterte said that he shot the student in a corridor at the college when the said student called him names again. He later told a reporter that the student survived, but refused to answer any further questions about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/780836/law-student-duterte-shot-frat-brod-on-campus-in-72 |title=Law student Duterte shot frat brod on campus in '72 |work=Inquirer.net |date=May 22, 2016 |accessdate=September 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- There was an earlier supplementary citation of a Rappler.com source, but per an RSN post, that appears to be a social media site or a venue for self-publishing, whose use here violated WP:BLPSPS.

As early as the first quarter of 2015, Duterte made hints to the media of his intention to run for president in the 2016 elections. However, he denied these plans numerous times amidst clamor from his supporters for him to run.

In January, Duterte said he would abolish Congress if he chose to run for President and was elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte eyes abolition of Congress if elected president in 2016|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2015/01/26/1416721/duterte-eyes-abolition-congress-if-elected-president-2016|accessdate=November 6, 2016|work=The Philippine Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21, in a private gathering with fraternity brothers from [[San Beda College of Law]], Duterte formally announced his presidential bid and also finally accepted [[Alan Peter Cayetano]]'s offer to be his running mate, and named his daughter, Sara Duterte, as his substitute for Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dioquino |first=Rose-An Jessica |date=November 27, 2015 |title=Duterte files COC for president |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/545982/news/nation/duterte-files-coc-for-president |publisher=[[GMA Network]] |location= |access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duterte makes a stand |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/duterte-makes-a-stand/#LubMmVQSGTGM834v.99 |website=Manila Bulletin |accessdate=November 22, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123202534/http://www.mb.com.ph/duterte-makes-a-stand/ |archivedate=November 23, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his campaign, he said he would introduce a federal parliamentary form of government. He also promised to kill tens of thousands of criminals and eradicate crime in six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines election: Duterte declares victory and promises change|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/rodrigo-duterte-declares-victory-in-philippines-election-vows-to-rewrite-constitution|accessdate=November 6, 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC6"/&gt;

===Constitutional reform===
Rodrigo Duterte campaigned for [[decentralization]] and a shift to federal government during the 2016 presidential election. In an October 2014 forum organized by ''Federal Movement for a Better Philippines'' in [[Cebu City]] prior to joining the presidential race, the then-mayor of Davao City called for the creation of two federal states for [[Moro people]] as a solution to the problems besetting [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref name="inq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/643859/argument-for-federalism-manila-steals-funds |title=Argument for federalism: Manila steals funds |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Lacorte, G. |date=October 10, 2014 |accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Duterte said that [[Nur Misuari]] and his [[Moro National Liberation Front]] don't see eye-to-eye with the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] which the administration of President [[Benigno Aquino III]] had inked a peace deal with. He also said that the "template of the [[Bangsamoro Basic Law]] is federal", but what is granted to the Bangsamoro should also be granted to other Moro groups and other regions in the country.&lt;ref name="chacha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/691847/duterte-change-in-form-of-govt-possible-only-through-con-con |title=Duterte: Change in form of gov't possible only through ‘Con-Con’ |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Lacorte, G. |date=May 17, 2015 |accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a dialogue with the [[Makati Business Club]] prior to the elections, Duterte said he is open to "toning down the Constitution" to accommodate more foreign investors to the Philippines.&lt;ref name="mb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2016.mb.com.ph/2016/04/28/duterte-open-to-toning-down-constitution-to-accommodate-foreign-investors/comment-page-16/ |title=Duterte open to ‘toning down’ Constitution to accommodate foreign investors |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |author=[[Philippine News Agency]] |date=April 28, 2016 |accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said he is open to up to 70 percent foreign ownership of businesses in the country and foreign lease of lands up to 60 years, but will "leave it to Congress to decide".&lt;ref name="mb"/&gt;

===Rape comments===
{{further information|Rodrigo Duterte presidential campaign, 2016#Rape of an Australian missionary}}
At a campaign rally on April 12, 2016, Duterte told supporters that, as Mayor, he thought he "should have been first" to rape Jacqueline Hamill, an Australian missionary who was [[gang-rape]]d and killed during the [[1989 Davao hostage crisis]]. He recalled examining her corpse: {{quote|text=When the bodies were brought out, they were wrapped. I looked at her face, son of a bitch, she looks like a beautiful American actress. Son of a bitch, what a waste. What came to my mind was, they raped her, they lined up. Was I angry because she was raped? Yes, that's one thing. But she was so beautiful, I think the mayor should have been first.

After being condemned for his comments, Duterte later apologized for the incident and acknowledged the comment as a "bad remark" saying he regretted his "gutter language" but would not apologize for being misinterpreted. He insists though that the remark was not a "joke" as reported by some media outlets, saying that he stated it in a narrative. He further said that he was not apologizing for stating the remark reasoning that he made the remark out of "utter anger" when he recalled the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-18/rodrigo-duterte-hits-back-back-as-rape-remark-sparks-fury/7333532|title=Rodrigo Duterte: Philippines presidential candidate hits back as rape remark sparks fury|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- There was an earlier supplementary citation of a Rappler.com source, but per an RSN post, that appears to be a social media site or a venue for self-publishing, whose use here violated WP:BLPSPS.

User:Hijiri88, October 2016. --&gt; He threatened to sever diplomatic ties with the US and Australia, if elected, after their ambassadors criticized his comments.&lt;ref name="ABC6"/&gt;

His daughter [[Sara Duterte]] subsequently announced on social media that she was a [[rape victim]], but would still vote for her father. He said that he doubted her story, jokingly referring to her as a "drama queen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte calls daughter drama queen|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/780443/duterte-calls-daughter-drama-queen|accessdate=October 5, 2016|work=Inquirer|date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a campaign speech on April 27 to business leaders, he said his presidency would be "a bloody one", but that he would issue "a thousand pardons a day" to police and soldiers accused of human rights abuses, and would also issue a presidential pardon to himself for mass murder at the end of his six-year term.&lt;ref name="ABC6"&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippine presidential frontrunner Rodrigo Duterte vows to pardon himself for murder|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-28/philippine-candidate-rodrigo-duterte-vows-murder-pardon/7365436|accessdate=November 6, 2016|work=Australian Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte began at noon on June 30, 2016, when he became the [[List of Philippine Presidents#List of Presidents|16th]] [[President of the Philippines]], succeeding [[Benigno Aquino III]].

At the age of 71, Duterte became the oldest person ever elected to the presidency. Duterte is also the first local chief executive to get elected straight to the Office of the President, the second [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] to become president (after [[Sergio Osmeña]]), the third [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]-speaking president (after Osmeña and [[Carlos P.

More than half were attributed to vigilantes. At the beginning of October, a senior police officer told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that ten "special ops" official police death squads had been operating, and that he had personally been involved in killing 87 suspects. He described how the corpses were dumped at the roadside ("salvage" victims), or had their heads wrapped in masking tape with a cardboard placard labelling them as a drug offender, so that the killing would not be investigated. The chairman of the [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]], [[Chito Gascon]], was quoted in the report: "I am not surprised, I have heard of this." The [[Philippine National Police]] declined to comment. The report stated: "although ''The Guardian'' can verify the policeman's rank and his service history, there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines secret death squads: officer claims police teams behind wave of killings|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/philippines-secret-death-squads-police-officer-teams-behind-killings|accessdate=October 6, 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mindanao Hariraya [[Eid al-Fitr]] 2016 convention in Davao City on July 8, 2016, Duterte vowed to address the Moro conflict and bring peace in Mindanao, assuring the [[Islam in the Philippines|Filipino Muslim]] community that "something will change" before the end of his term. He said that the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) and the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF) both support his proposal for [[federalism in the Philippines]], which he says is the only solution to the Bangsamoro peace process. Duterte said that if the proposal for the country's shift to federalism fails or is not desired by the Filipino people, he will vow to pass the [[Bangsamoro Basic Law]], which would establish the [[Bangsamoro (political entity)|Bangsamoro Autonomous Region]]. He also added that the Basic Law should benefit both MILF and MNLF, saying he is willing to negotiate with both secessionists to initiate a "reconfiguration" of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartolome|first1=Jessica|title=Plan B: Duterte promises BBL for both MNLF, MILF if Filipinos vote against federalism|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/572959/news/nation/plan-b-duterte-promises-bbl-for-both-mnlf-milf-if-filipinos-vote-against-federalism|accessdate=July 9, 2016|publisher=[[GMA News Online]]|date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Jesus|first1=Julliane Love|title=Duterte promises to fix insurgency, war in Mindanao before his term ends|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/795114/duterte-promises-to-fix-insurgency-war-in-mindanao-before-his-term-ends|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2016, Duterte signed an executive order to expand the [[Bangsamoro Transition Commission]] to 21 members from 15, in which 11 will be decided by the MILF and 10 will be nominated by the government.

====Terrorism====

The [[Maute group]], an ISIS-inspired terrorist group, had reportedly been able to establish a stronghold in Lanao del Sur since early 2016. The group had been blamed for the [[2016 Davao City bombing]] and two attacks in [[Butig, Lanao del Sur]], a town located south of Marawi, in 2016.&lt;ref name="mautegrp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/170772-fast-facts-maute-group |title=FAST FACTS: What you should know about the Maute Group |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Francisco, K. |date=May 24, 2017 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Duterte administration, the Philippine government had downplayed the threat of ISIS in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/111463/aquino-downplays-isis-threat-in-ph |title=Aquino downplays ISIS threat in PH |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Esguerra, C.V. |date=September 21, 2014 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the [[February 2016 Butig clash]] with the Maute group, then-President [[Benigno Aquino III]] discounted the possibility of the Islamic State's presence in the country. He said that those behind the attack were just mercenaries wanting to be recognized by the Middle East-based terror group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/no-isis-in-mindanao-aquino/249460/ |title=No ISIS in Mindanao – Aquino |publisher=[[The Manila Times]] |date=March 9, 2016 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, President Duterte confirmed the Maute group's affiliation with the Islamic State.&lt;ref name="mautegrp"/&gt; Amidst [[November 2016 Butig clash|fierce fighting in Butig]] on November 30, 2016, Duterte, in a command briefing in Lanao del Sur, warned the Maute group: "''Ayaw ko makipag-away sa inyo.

I cannot be forever traveling here every month ''para lang makipag-usap'' (just to talk), ''at pagtalikod ko patayan na naman'' (and when I turn around, there's killing again).

On May 23, 2017, clashes between [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government]] [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|security forces]] and militants affiliated with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), including the [[Maute group|Maute]] and [[Abu Sayyaf]] [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadist]] groups erupted in the city of Marawi.&lt;ref name="crisis1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/25/1703153/marawi-crisis-what-we-know-so-far |title=Marawi crisis: What we know so far |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |date=May 25, 2017 |accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, Duterte signed [[Proclamation No. 216]] declaring a 60-day [[martial law]] in Mindanao following [[Marawi crisis|clashes]] between the AFP and the [[Maute group]] in [[Marawi]], [[Lanao del Sur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mendoza|first1=Greanne|title=Duterte declares Martial Law in Mindanao|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/23/17/duterte-declares-martial-law-in-mindanao|accessdate=May 24, 2017|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]]|date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the implementation is similar to [[Proclamation No. 1081]] and expressed the possibility of extending the scope of the martial law nationwide if deemed necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Martial law in Mindanao could last a year—Duterte|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/899057/martial-law-in-mindanao-could-last-a-year-duterte|accessdate=May 24, 2017|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|via=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maute group militants attacked Camp Ranao and occupied several buildings in the city, including Marawi City Hall, [[Mindanao State University]], a hospital, and the city jail.&lt;ref name="inq2"/&gt; They also occupied the main street and set fire to [[St. Mary's Cathedral (Marawi)|Saint Mary's Cathedral]], Ninoy Aquino School, and Dansalan College, which is run by the [[United Church of Christ in the Philippines]] (UCCP).&lt;ref name="abs1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCCP Statement on the Burning of Dansalan College|url=http://www.globalministries.org/uccp_statement_on_the_burning_of_dansalan_college|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militants also took a priest and several churchgoers hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/mindanao-churchgoers-hostage-marawi-siege-170524085829461.html |title=Mindanao: Churchgoers 'taken hostage' amid Marawi siege |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=May 24, 2017 |accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] stated that some of the terrorists were foreigners who had been in the country for a long time, offering support to the Maute group in Marawi.

The Duterte administration has vowed to pursue an "independent foreign policy" that would reject any meddling by foreign governments, reiterating [[Constitution of the Philippines#Article 2. Declaration of Principles and State Policies|Article II]], Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution which states: "The State shall pursue an independent foreign policy. In its relations with other states the paramount consideration shall be national [[sovereignty]], [[territorial integrity]], [[national interest]], and the right to [[self-determination]]." In September 2016, Duterte said: "We will observe and must insist on the time-honored principle of sovereignty, sovereign equality, non-interference and the commitment of peaceful settlements of dispute that will serve our people and protect the interests of our country."&lt;ref name="independent foreign policy"/&gt;

Duterte made his first international trips as president to [[Vientiane]], [[Laos]] and [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] on September 5–9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicolas|first1=Fiona|title=Duterte heads to Laos for ASEAN summit|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/09/05/Duterte-heads-to-Laos-Asean-summit.html|accessdate=September 10, 2016|publisher=[[CNN Philippines]]|date=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' published aerial surveillance photos of Chinese military fortifications in the South China Sea which showed runways, hangars, control towers, helipads, radomes and multi-storey buildings on reefs across the region, described by the newspaper as "island fortresses". The photos, which were mostly taken in late 2017, were authenticated by the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], which described them as "the most complete, detailed batch of aerial pics available", and stated that the "photos show China is nearly done with its militarization of South China Sea". Duterte's spokesman told reporters: "[The region has] long been militarized. And the question is, what can we do?" - which led to accusations of dereliction of his "sacred core duty" of defending Philippine territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photos show Beijing’s militarisation of South China Sea in new detail|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/06/photos-beijings-militarisation-south-china-sea-philippines|accessdate=19 February 2018|work=The Guardian|date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his term, Duterte's expletive-laden outbursts triggered the biggest exodus from stocks in a year and made the peso Asia's worst performer in September 2016. The Philippine currency was at a seven-year low and rounding out its worst month since May 2010. In the same month, the Philippine peso completed its biggest monthly decline since October 2000 amid the biggest outflow from the nation's stocks in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-30/philippine-peso-completes-worst-month-in-16-years-amid-outflows |title=Philippine Peso Completes Worst Month in 16 Years Amid Outflows |author=Lopez, Ditas B. |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=September 30, 2016 |accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Philippines' Finance Secretary [[Carlos Dominguez]], the peso's slump this year is "mainly due to a deteriorating trade outlook because of rising imports of capital goods, which is normal for a country that is growing very fast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/philippines-in-a-sweet-spot-despite-peso-slump-dominguez-says | title=RP in sweet spot despite peso slump |date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currency strategists have, however, "predicted a rebound once investors see beyond Duterte's words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/duterte-s-noisy-peso-rout-out-of-harmony-with-philippine-economy |title=Duterte's Peso Rout Runs Counter to the Booming Philippine Economy |last1=Liau |first1=Y-Sing |last2=Lopez |first2=Ditas B |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=September 29, 2016 |accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential immunity===
On November 7, 2016, Senator [[Leila de Lima]], Duterte's chief government critic, filed a Supreme Court writ of ''[[habeas data]]'' against Duterte, testing the doctrine of presidential immunity, stating "The verbal attacks on petitioner's womanhood and threats on her person are not covered by presidential immunity from suit because they are not the official act of a President". The 20-page writ asked, "Can a sitting President wage a personal vendetta against petitioner and use the resources of his powerful office to crucify her as a woman, a human being, and a duly elected senator in violation of her right to privacy in life, liberty and security?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De Lima challenges Duterte's immunity|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/07/1641379/de-lima-challenges-dutertes-immunity|accessdate=November 9, 2016|work=Philippine Star|date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lima's counsel, [[De La Salle University College of Law]] dean [[Jose Manuel Diokno]], said "Immunity cannot be used to block this case. There is a blatant violation of the magna carta for women, code of conduct for public officials. We hope the Supreme Court will listen to the plea of Senator de Lima and give consideration to this petition because we believe it is of groundbreaking importance".&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

Presidential spokesperson [[Ernesto Abella]] said that "Senator Leila de Lima is apparently playing the gender card as a shield against mounting evidence of her ties with high-profile drug lords and the [[New Bilibid Prison drug trafficking scandal|proliferation of drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison]]". Chief Presidential Legal Counsel [[Salvador Panelo]] said that "the president is immune from suit but even if he is not, the petition has no basis in fact nor in law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palace: De Lima playing gender card as shield|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/07/1641390/palace-de-lima-playing-gender-card-shield|accessdate=November 9, 2016|work=Philippine Star|date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 2015, an infamous incident was reported of a tourist being forced to swallow his own cigarette butt in a local bar in Davao City after the tourist refused to comply with the public anti-smoking ordinance of the city. Duterte was personally contacted by the bar owner and went into the bar and forced the tourist to swallow his cigarette butt. Duterte was then met with criticisms especially from the [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights (CHR)]].&lt;ref name="Inquirer-CigaretteSwallow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gonzales|first1=Yuji Vincent|title=Davao tourist swallows cigarette butt after reprimand from Duterte|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/719038/davao-tourist-swallows-cigarette-butt-after-reprimand-from-duterte|accessdate=December 19, 2016|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=September 3, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905145735/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/719038/davao-tourist-swallows-cigarette-butt-after-reprimand-from-duterte|archivedate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the arrest of a suspected rice smuggler, Duterte spoke out in the state senate saying, "If this guy would go to Davao and starts [sic] to unload (smuggled rice)&amp;nbsp;... I will gladly kill him." For these comments, Duterte was attacked in an editorial in ''[[The Manila Times]]'', which condemned "the mentality of lawlessness and vigilantism".&lt;ref name="The Manila Times 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Duterte and the Law Enforcers' Code of Ethics|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/duterte-and-the-law-enforcers-code-of-ethics/73513/|website=Manila Times |publisher=Manila Times|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper argued that this culture of impunity enabled those in power, including officials, "private warlords and businessmen vigilantes" to take retribution against those they felt had acted against their interests: "They kill journalists exposing corruption and human rights activists exposing abusive police and military men."&lt;ref name="The Manila Times 3" /&gt; Following Duterte's comments in relation to killing a person suspected of smuggling rice, the office of the President of the Philippines issued a statement saying, "Killing a person is against the law.

In October 2016, the French newspaper ''[[Libération]]'' depicted Duterte as a "serial killer president", pertaining to the spate of drug-related killings in the Philippines. The newspaper report drew condemnation from the Filipino community in France. Presidential Spokesperson [[Ernesto Abella]] said in a radio interview that the newspaper's presentation of Duterte as a serial killer was "very unfair" and "irresponsible" while DILG Secretary [[Ismael Sueno]] stated that the description was "too much" and noted the lack of understanding over the administration's war on drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/146418/french-paper-banners-duterte-as-serial-killer-president |title=French paper banners Duterte as ‘serial killer president' |author=Gonzales, Yuji Vincent |website=Inquirer.net |date=October 9, 2016 |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/palace-hits-french-dailys-serial-killer-tag-on-duterte/ |title=Palace hits French daily's "serial killer" tag on Duterte |author=Kabiling, Genalyn |work=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=October 9, 2016 |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/10/10/1632125/french-newspaper-calls-duterte-serial-killer |title=French newspaper calls Duterte 'serial killer'  |website=philstar.com |date=October 10, 2016 |accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As 2016 concluded, the [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]] (OCCRP) nominated Duterte as a runner-up in their ''2016 Person of the Year Award'' that "recognizes the individual who has done the most in the world to advance organized criminal activity and corruption".&lt;ref name=OCCRP2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuelan president wins OCCRP person of the year for 2016|url=https://www.occrp.org/personoftheyear/2016/|publisher=OCCRP|accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCCRP panel members who recognized Duterte noted his use of "death squads to slaughter drug dealers (and users)", with some panelists comparing his use of vigilante groups to those of the ''2016 Person of the Year Award'' winner, Venezuelan president [[Nicolás Maduro]].&lt;ref name=OCCRP2016/&gt; In 2017, the investigative journalists' network [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project|OCCRP]] has named Duterte ''Person of the Year in Organized Crime''.&lt;ref name="duterte"&gt;{{cite news |title=OCCRP announces 2017 Organized Crime and Corruption ‘Person of the Year’ Award |url=https://www.occrp.org/personoftheyear/2017/ |work=Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project |quote=Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is the Person of the Year for 2017, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), an organization that has for six years recognized the individual who has done the most in the world to advance organized criminal activity and corruption. "Duterte has made a mockery of rule of law in his country", said Drew Sullivan, editor for the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and one of the nine judges who made the selection from nominations submitted by journalists and the public. "While he is not your typical corrupt leader, he has empowered corruption in an innovative way. His death squads have allegedly focused on criminals but, in fact, are less discriminating. He has empowered a bully-run system of survival of the fiercest. In the end, the Philippines are more corrupt, more cruel, and less democratic." – Drew Sullivan. Duterte beat out two African strongmen for the title. South African President Jacob Zuma and recently ousted Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe were runners-up. The global panel of nine corruption-fighting journalists, scholars and activists chose Duterte on the strength of his brutal war on drugs. Blunt, swaggering and profane, Duterte has vigorously implemented his pledge to use any tactic necessary to stop drug use. "Hitler massacred 3 million Jews", he declared in a disturbing comparison last year. "There are 3 million drug addicts. I'd be happy to slaughter them."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Duterte said that the United States has not even apologized to the Philippines for its atrocities during the [[Philippine–American War]].&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt;  In October 2016, Duterte continued his tirade against the US and the European Union saying in Tagalog that "Mr. Obama,  you can go to hell. EU, better choose purgatory. Hell is already full. Why should I be afraid of you?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/10/05/duterte-tells-obama-go-to-hell.html|title=Duterte tells Obama to 'go to hell,' explains frustration with U.S.|work=cnnphilippines.com|accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duterte's constant cursing had local officials worried that the Philippines would lose foreign aid from the United States and European Union.  He responded that “If you think it is high time for you guys to withdraw your assistance, go ahead.  We will not beg for it. We have a problem here trying to preserve our society" he said.  The President continued that he would “be the first to go hungry. I will be the first one to die of hunger". Local actress [[Agot Isidro]] responded in Tagalog "First of all, no one's trying to fight you. As a matter of fact, you're the one who's picking a fight. Secondly, the country where you are elected as President by 16 million out of 100+ million is Third World. You talk as if the Philippines is a superpower. Excuse me, we don't want to go hungry. If you want, you do it yourself. Leave us out of it.

During the [[APEC Peru 2016|2016 APEC Summit]] in Peru, President Duterte skipped two major events due to jet lag.  In a press conference at his office in Makati, former president Ramos hit the absence of Duterte at the APEC gala dinner and the shoot for the leaders’ traditional family photo.  Ramos said that while Duterte and his Cabinet may have thought that the two events are negligible, it could have disappointed the host country.  “Peru President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski must be very disappointed,” Ramos said.  He said the gala night could have been an opportunity for Duterte to exchange ideas with world leaders and sickness is an unacceptable alibi to skip such an important gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/22/1646177/fvr-duterte-big-disappointment-peru|title=FVR: Duterte a big disappointment in Peru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Duterte revealed that he advised [[Myanmar]]'s [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] to 'ignore human rights criticisms on Rohingya issue'.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnation.inquirer.net/163689/duterte-suu-kyi-ignore-human-rights-criticisms-rohingya-issue-duterte-myanmar-suu-kyi-rohingya-muslims-asean-meetings&lt;/ref&gt; In April 5, 2018, Duterte recognized the existence of a [[genocide]] against the [[Rohingya people]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/649045/duterte-cites-lsquo-genocide-rsquo-in-myanmar-says-phl-will-take-rohingya-refugees/story/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church in the Philippines had lost much of its popularity and political power since being active in overthrowing [[Proclamation No. 1081|the Marcos regime in 1986]].

Duterte committed to lessen his profanity in public gatherings and even assured that he would donate ₱1,000 to Caritas Davao every time he swears in public.

On August 28, 2016, [[Luis Antonio Tagle]], the Archbishop of Manila, acknowledged that people were right to be "worried about extrajudicial killing".

On August 31, in a speech before a gathering of a religious group in Davao City, Duterte said that he once considered being a priest: "It's good I didn't join the priesthood," said Duterte, "or else now I would be a homosexual."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/579828/news/nation/duterte-once-wanted-to-be-a-priest-buti-na-lang-hindi-ako-nasali |title=Duterte once wanted to be a priest: ‘Buti na lang, hindi ako nasali’ |author=Macas, Trisha |work=[[GMA News]] |date=September 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on media killings===
The Philippines is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, with 174 assassinations recorded since the Marcos dictatorship. In a press conference on May 31, 2016, Duterte said that "Most of those killed, to be frank, have done something. You won't be killed if you don't do anything wrong." He appeared to announce his support for killing "corrupt" journalists: "Just because you're a journalist you are not exempted from assassination if you're a son of a bitch".

At the press conference where Duterte announced this, he [[wolf-whistling|wolf-whistled]] at a female journalist ([[Mariz Umali]] of [[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]]) when she asked a question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/misogynistic-philippines-leader-rodrigo-duterte_us_575043bbe4b0eb20fa0ce55e|title=Misogynistic Philippines Leader Duterte Continues To Disrespect Women |last=Cook |first=Jesselyn|date=June 2, 2016|website=Huffington Post|access-date=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a news conference on the following day he defended his comments and refused to apologise, telling reporters, "I cannot protect you". He has been criticized by foreign and domestic media organizations regarding his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines' Duterte offers no apology for attacks on media |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-politics-idUSKCN0YO26V|accessdate=November 16, 2016|publisher=Reuters|date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southeast Asia representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists said: "What he has done with these irresponsible comments is give security officials the right to kill for acts that they consider defamation.

Melinda Quintos de Jesus, executive director of the Center for Media Freedom, stated in October 2016 that major newspapers and television stations have not critically analyzed Duterte's policies, because "they fear him. They basically are afraid to be singled out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rodrigo Duterte, Scorned Abroad, Remains Popular in the Philippines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/world/asia/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-rating.html|accessdate=October 16, 2016|work=New York Times|date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his rocky relationship with the media, Duterte's first Administrative Order was the creation of a Presidential Task Force on Media Security, whose main task is conduct an inventory of cases of media killings, including unsolved cases, cases under investigation, cases under preliminary investigation, cases under trial, and cases under appeal, and "to put an end to all forms of political violence and abuses of powers against members of the fourth estate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/task-force-vs-media-killings-hailed/335627/ | title = Media workers hail task force}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/13/16/duterte-creates-task-force-on-media-killings | title = Duterte creates task force to protect media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year that Duterte took office, four journalists were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/11/philippine-journalist-killings-demand-state-action | title = Philippine Journalist Killings Demand State Action }} &lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Personal killings ===

Duterte has repeatedly admitted to killing three people while he was the Mayor of Davao. In December 2015, Duterte recounted shooting three gunmen dead only months into his first mayoral term in 1988 after they had kidnapped and raped a Chinese girl. He justified his actions, saying "they were committing a crime in my presence and I was the person in authority under the law".&lt;ref name=1988kidnap&gt;{{cite web|last1=dela Cruz|first1=Kathlyn|title=Duterte confirms killing 3 rapist-kidnappers|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/halalan2016/nation/12/09/15/duterte-confirms-killing-3-rapist-kidnappers|publisher=[[ABS-CBN]]|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with BBC on December 16, 2016, he said: "I killed about three of them, because there were three of them.

On December 14, 2016, Duterte gave a speech to business leaders in the presidential palace where he spoke of personally killing suspected criminals as Mayor of Davao to set an example for local police. He said, "In Davao I used to do it personally. Just to show to the guys that if I can do it why can't you. And I'd go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, looking for trouble also."&lt;ref name=cannotlie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duterte says he patrolled streets looking for criminals to kill|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEgGVXZkZc|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldman|first1=Russell|title=Rodrigo Duterte on Killing Criminal Suspects: ‘I Used to Do It Personally’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-killings.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaviria claimed that Duterte is simply repeating his mistakes during his term as president when he used heavy-handed means in Colombia's war against drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/opinion/president-duterte-is-repeating-my-mistakes.html|title=President Duterte Is Repeating My Mistakes|last=Gaviria|first=César|date=February 7, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 18, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte said Gaviria was “lecturing” and the Philippine case was different to Colombia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Various international publications and media companies had claimed that Duterte's "War on Drugs" was a war against the poor due to the abject poverty of those arrested or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4462352/rodrigo-duterte-drug-war-drugs-philippines-killing/|title=The Killing Time: Inside Rodrigo Duterte's Drug War|last=Manila|first=Rishi Iyengar /|website=Time|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/02/war-on-drugs-war-on-poor/|title=Philippines: Duterte's 'war on drugs' is a war on the poor|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the investigative journalists' network [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project|OCCRP]] reported that "Duterte has overseen the killing of more than 7,000 and possibly as many as 12,000. The statistics are hard to pin down because Duterte’s National Police suppress all critical reports. And police are spared from any accountability or legal consequences for a campaign that has left bodies in the streets."&lt;ref name="duterte"/&gt;

On August 18, 2017, Duterte admitted his mistake in trying to end drugs in six months, and it would take him his entire term to end it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/08/18/1730277/6-years-drug-war|title=‘6 years for drug war’|last=Romero|first=Alexis|work=philstar.com|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte stated that he had no idea when he took office that Philippines had become a failed state, having been degenerated into a [[narco-state]]. He blamed the [[Bureau of Customs]] whose people he thought were loyal to him. He also blamed the governors, mayors and policemen who were involved in drugs and threatened to have them killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/08/17/1730136/duterte-admits-he-was-wrong-about-6-month-deadline-vs-drugs|title=Duterte admits he was wrong about 6-month deadline vs drugs|last=Romero|first=Alexis|work=philstar.com|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duterte administration had been using a "narco-list" which Duterte shares with the mass media to warn public officials allegedly involved in the drug trade to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/08/17/1730085/updated-narco-list-now-pnp-chiefs-hands|title=Updated ‘narco-list’ now in PNP chief's hands|last=Bolando|first=AJ|work=philstar.com|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte claims to have received several death threats because of his campaign against drugs.

==Personal life==
Duterte is known for being an avid fan of [[Cruiser (motorcycle)|big bike]]s but detests luxury cars. He once owned a second-hand [[Harley-Davidson]] and currently a [[Yamaha Virago]]. He was once a habitual [[smoking|smoker]], but he eventually quit after a doctor's suggestion due to health concerns. Duterte is an avid reader of [[Robert Ludlum]] and [[Sidney Sheldon]] novels.&lt;ref name="Duterte22"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ranada |first1=Pia |last2=Caduaya |first2=Editha |date=September 18, 2015 |title=22 things to know about 'Duterte Harry' |url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/105955-things-know-trivia-rodrigo-duterte |publisher=''[[Rappler]]'' |location= |access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte is also known for his straightforward and vocal attitude in public especially in interviews, showing no hesitation in using [[profanity]] profusely live on-screen on numerous occasions despite formal requests by media groups and schools beforehand to abstain.&lt;ref name="DBD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://durianburgdavao.wordpress.com/2015/05/16/the-dutertes-in-davao-city-politics/|title=The Dutertes in Davao City Politics|work=Durian Post by DurianburgDavao}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Regalado |first=Edith |date=March 3, 2001 |title=Davao City Mayoral Race; Duterte siblings slugging it out |url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/104586/davao-city-mayoral-race-duterte-siblings-slugging-it-out |newspaper=''[[The Philippine Star|Philstar]]'' |location= |access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duterte has his own local show in Davao City called ''Gikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa'' ("From the Masses, For the Masses") aired as a [[block programming|blocktimer]] on [[DXAS-TV|ABS-CBN Davao]]. He is also a member of [[Lex Talionis Fraternitas]], a fraternity based in the [[San Beda College of Law]] and the [[Ateneo de Davao University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Monforte |first=Cha |date=April 15, 2015 |title=2 Duterte aides hurt in accident |url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/2-duterte-aides-hurt-in-accident |newspaper=[[BusinessMirror]] |location= |access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his native [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], Duterte is also fluent in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Apostol |first=Gina |date=May 29, 2017 |title=Speaking in Fascism’s Tongues |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/opinion/sunday/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-fascism.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location= |access-date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===

[[File:Rodrigo Duterte and Cielito Avanceña family portrait.jpg|thumb|Duterte with Avanceña along with their daughter, Veronica]]
Duterte was once married to [[Elizabeth Zimmerman|Elizabeth Abellana Zimmerman]], a flight attendant from Davao City and is of [[Jewish]] [[German American]] descent who also traces her roots in [[Tuburan, Cebu]]. They together have three children (from eldest to youngest): [[Paolo Duterte|Paolo]] ("Pulong"), [[Sara Duterte|Sara]] ("Inday Sara") and Sebastian ("Bastê"). Paolo and Sara ventured into politics while Baste, with no interest in politics, concentrated on business and surfing.&lt;ref name="DBD" /&gt; In 2012, Duterte made a notorious remark in a media interview regarding an incident where Paolo's name was allegedly linked to a carnapping ([[portmanteau]] of car and [[kidnapping]]) syndicate led by Ryan Yu. Duterte is infamously quoted as having said: "Kill my son Paolo if he is involved in crime." Paolo was never charged for lack of evidence and eventually won the Davao City vice mayoralty in 2013.&lt;ref name="DurianBurgDavao-KillMySon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balanza|first1=Roger M.|title=Rody Duterte: Kill my son Paolo if he is involved in crime|url=https://durianburgdavao.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/rody-duterte-kill-my-son-paolo-if-he-is-involved-in-crime/|accessdate=September 14, 2016|work=The Durian Post|date=October 28, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304141142/https://durianburgdavao.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/rody-duterte-kill-my-son-paolo-if-he-is-involved-in-crime/|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte's father Vicente died in 1968 while his mother Soledad died on February 4, 2012, at the age of 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lacorte |first=Germelina |date=February 5, 2012 |title=Duterte matriarch dies at 95 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/140077/duterte-matriarch-dies-at-95 |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer|Inquirer.net]] |location= |access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmerman was diagnosed with [[Cancer staging|stage 3]] [[breast cancer]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/561578/news/nation/duterte-s-ex-wife-skips-cancer-treatments-to-launch-campaign-caravan Duterte's ex-wife skips cancer treatments to launch campaign caravan &amp;ndash; ''GMA News Online''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Duterte has been publicly very open about his infidelity and philandering while married to Zimmerman and cited it as the reason for his failed first marriage when asked in interviews. In 1998, Zimmerman filed a petition with the [[Regional Trial Court]] in [[Pasig]] to nullify her marriage. Duterte never appeared in court and did not contest Zimmerman's petition. Two years later, the court decided in her favor, ending the 27-year marriage of Duterte and Zimmerman. Duterte and Zimmerman have been on good terms in recent years with Zimmerman stating, "Yes, [Rodrigo] is really a very good leader. That is all he is. But when it comes to family, he is not capable of taking care of it." In 2001, Zimmerman eventually ran for a seat on the city council but lost. Duterte and Zimmerman are said to have patched things up and appear to be civil to each other, 15 years after their marriage was declared null and void. Zimmerman eventually joined the campaign trail for Duterte's presidential candidacy in early 2016 called ''Byaheng Du30'' in which she would travel by bus to major cities together with her daughter Sara and a number of delegates.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman" /&gt;

Duterte is currently living with his [[common-law marriage|common-law wife]] Cielito "Honeylet" Avanceña, a nurse, with whom he has one daughter named Veronica ("Kitty"). Duterte has eight grandchildren, half of whom are Muslims and the other half Christian.&lt;ref name="BoholNewsToday-Conflict"&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte wants conflict with Muslims settled|url=http://boholnewstoday.com/201501/duterte-wants-conflict-with-muslims-settled.html|accessdate=September 14, 2016|work=Bohol News Today|date=January 13, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603155536/http://boholnewstoday.com/201501/duterte-wants-conflict-with-muslims-settled.html|archivedate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SunStarDavao-CallingDuterte"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ledesma|first1=Jun|title=Calling Duterte|url=http://archive.sunstar.com.ph/davao/opinion/2015/02/12/ledesma-calling-duterte-391700|accessdate=September 14, 2016|work=Sun.Star Davao|date=February 12, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930011541/http://archive.sunstar.com.ph/davao/opinion/2015/02/12/ledesma-calling-duterte-391700|archivedate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancestry===
On his paternal side, he shares familial ties with some of the prominent families of the Visayas, particularly the Almendrases &amp; Duranos of [[Danao, Cebu]].{{efn|name="duterte-durano-almendras"|Brothers Facundo &amp; Severo Duterte both married women from Danao; Severo's daughter Beatriz married post-War business magnate Ramon M.

===Religion===
Despite being raised as a communicant of the [[Catholic Church]], on January 19, 2016, while meeting with businessmen in [[Binondo]], Manila, Duterte clarified that he has not attended [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] for quite some time already since he deemed it incompatible with his mayoral responsibilities: "If I listened to the [[Ten Commandments]] or to the priests" said Duterte, "I would not be able to do anything as a mayor". He then clarified that he still believes in God, but not in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/05/20/1585212/duterte-says-he-believes-god-not-religion |last=Romero |first=Alexis |title=Duterte says he believes in God but not in religion |website=Philstar.com |date=May 20, 2016 |accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2016, Duterte said he's [[Christianity|Christian]], but also said that he believes "in one god [[Allah]]".&lt;ref name="Christian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/duterte.vows.to.promote.birth.control.in.the.philippines.says.hes.a.christian.but.believes.in.one.god.allah/89535.htm |title=Duterte vows to promote birth control in the Philippines, says he's a Christian but believes 'in one god Allah' |author=Torres, Hazel |work=[[Christian Today]] |date=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, he called himself "[[Spiritual but not religious|spiritual]]" and expressed his belief in "one Supreme [[God]]", but stated he "can't accept" [[Catholicism]] or [[organised religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/rodrigo-duterte-doubles-down-on-attack-on-god-asks-for-proof.html|title=Rodrigo Duterte doubles down on attack on God, asks for proof|date=July 8, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Duterte has [[Thromboangiitis obliterans|Buerger's disease]], an inflammation of blood vessels, mostly in the limbs, and [[Barrett's esophagus]], wherein esophageal cells are gradually replaced by gastrointestinal cells. He has denied rumors of [[throat cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frialde|first1=Mike|title=Duterte: I may not last 6 years in office|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/12/10/1531028/duterte-i-may-not-last-6-years-office|accessdate=December 17, 2015|work=The Philippine Star|date=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prescription drug use===
Duterte admitted in December 2016 that he had been a user of the addictive [[opioid]] drug [[Fentanyl]]. He said that a doctor prescribed the drug to alleviate back pain and headaches, but that he would take more than he was prescribed: "I was only given a fourth of [the whole patch], but no more, because, of course, my doctor learned that I was using the whole patch because I felt better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines President Duterte admits killing suspects|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/14/asia/duterte-philippines-davao-killings/|accessdate=December 17, 2016|work=CNN|date=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fentanyl is described by the US [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] as "a powerful synthetic opioid analgesic that is similar to [[morphine]] but is 50 to 100 times more potent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte’s painkiller too strong to prescribe, says medical specialist|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/592535/lifestyle/healthandwellness/duterte-s-painkiller-too-strong-to-prescribe-says-medical-specialist|accessdate=December 15, 2016|work=GMA|date=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte later denied that he was a drug addict, and a spokesman stated that he was not affected by side-effects of the drug, which include confusion, anxiety and [[hallucination]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines: Duterte confirms he personally killed three men|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38337746|accessdate=December 17, 2016|work=BBC|date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duterte has boasted about his use of [[Viagra]]: "When I was young, I could do overnight, which is more expensive. When I got old, I could do short time only because I have such a short time left. After one erection, that's it. No more. Without Viagra, it's even more difficult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte's shocking, shrewd shot at the Philippine presidency|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/duterte-s-shocking-shrewd/2761902.html|accessdate=October 5, 2016|work=Channel NewsAsia|date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ranada |first=Pia |date=November 30, 2015 |title=Rodrigo Duterte: Yes, I'm a womanizer |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/114416-rodrigo-duterte-womanizer |publisher=''[[Rappler]]'' |location= |access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rumor''' ([[American English]]) or '''rumour''' ([[British English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|see spelling differences]]) (origin word from '''latin''' is '[https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/rumor rumorem]', or noise) is "a tall tale of explanations of events circulating from person to person and pertaining to an object, event, or issue in public concern."&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peterson  | first1 = Warren | last2 = Gist | first2 = Noel | title = Rumor and Public Opinion | journal = The American Journal of Sociology | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–167 | date = September 1951  | doi = 10.1086/220916 | jstor=2772077}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[social sciences]], a rumor involves some kind of a statement whose veracity is not quickly or ever confirmed. In addition, some scholars have identified rumor as a subset of [[propaganda]]. [[Sociology]], [[psychology]], and communication studies have widely varying definitions of rumor.&lt;ref&gt;Pendleton, S.c. (1998), 'Rumor research revisited and expanded', ''Language &amp; Communication'', vol. 1. no. 18, pp. 69-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors are also often discussed with regard to "misinformation" and "disinformation" (the former often seen as simply false and the latter seen as deliberately false, though usually from a government source given to the media or a foreign government).&lt;ref&gt;from Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors thus have often been viewed as particular forms of other communication concepts.

== Early work ==

French and German social science research on rumor locates the modern scholarly definition of it to the pioneering work of the German [[Louis William Stern|William Stern]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;L. William Stern, Zur Psychologie der Aussage. Experimentelle Untersuchungen über Erinnerungstreue. "Zeitschrift für die gesamte Strafechtswissenschaft". Vol. XXII, cahier 2/3, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Stern experimented on rumor involving a "chain of subjects" who passed a story from "mouth to ear" without the right to repeat or explain it. He found that the story was shortened and changed by the time it reached the end of the chain. His student was another pioneer in the field, [[Gordon Allport]].

The experiment is similar to the children's game [[Chinese whispers]].

== 1944 study ==
"A Psychology of Rumor" was published by {{ill|Robert H. Knapp|fr}} in 1944, in which he reports on his analysis of over one thousand rumors during World War II that were printed in the ''[[Boston Herald]]'''s "[[Boston Herald Rumor Clinic|Rumor Clinic]]" Column. He defines rumor as 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''
a proposition for belief of topical reference disseminated without official verification''. So formidably defined, rumor is but a special case of informal social communications, including myth, legend, and current humor. From myth and legend it is distinguished by its emphasis on the topical. Where humor is designed to provoke laughter, rumor begs for belief.&lt;ref&gt;p.22&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Knapp identified three basic characteristics that apply to rumor: 
# they're transmitted by word of mouth; 
# they provide "information" about a "person, happening, or condition"; and 
# they express and gratify "the emotional needs of the community." 
Crucial to this definition and its characteristics is the emphasis on transmission (word of mouth, which then was heard and reported in the newspaper); on content ("topical" means that it can somehow be distinguished from trivial and private subjects—its domain is public issues); and on reception ("emotional needs of the community" suggests that though it is received by an individual from an individual, it is not comprehended in individual but community or social terms).

Based on his study of the newspaper column, Knapp divided those rumors into three types:
# Pipe dream rumors: reflect public desires and wished-for outcomes.(e.g. Japan's oil reserves were low and thus World War II would soon end.)
# Bogie or fear rumors reflect feared outcomes.(e.g. An enemy surprise attack is imminent).
# Wedge-driving rumors intend to undermine group loyalty or interpersonal relations (e.g. American Catholics were seeking to avoid the draft; German-Americans, Italian-Americans, Japanese-Americans were not loyal to the American side).

Knapp also found that negative rumors were more likely to be disseminated than positive rumors. These types also differentiate between positive (pipe dream) and negative (bogie and wedge-driving) rumors.

== 1947 study ==

In the 1947 study, ''Psychology of Rumor'', Gordon Allport and {{ill|Leo Postman|fr}} concluded that, "as rumor travels it [...] grows shorter, more concise, more easily grasped and told."&lt;ref name=rumorchange&gt;{{cite book   | last1= Allport  | first1= Gordon  | authorlink = Gordon Allport  | author2= Leo Postman  | title = Psychology of Rumor  | publisher = Russell and Russell  | year = 1951  | pages = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion was based on a test of message diffusion between persons, which found that about 70% of details in a message were lost in the first 5-6 mouth-to-mouth transmissions.&lt;ref name=rumorchange/&gt;

In the experiment, a test subject was shown an illustration and given time to look it over. They were then asked to describe the scene from memory to a second test subject. This second test subject was then asked to describe the scene to a third, and so forth and so on. Each person’s reproduction was recorded. This process was repeated with different illustrations with very different settings and contents.

Allport and Postman used three terms to describe the movement of rumor. They are: ''leveling'', ''sharpening'', and ''assimilation''. Leveling refers to the loss of detail during the transmission process; sharpening to the selection of certain details of which to transmit; and assimilation to a distortion in the transmission of information as a result of [[subconscious]] motivations.

Assimilation was observed when test subjects described the illustrations as they ought to be but not as they actually were. For example, in an illustration depicting a battle-scene, test subjects often incorrectly reported an ambulance truck in the background of the illustration as carrying “medical supplies,” when, in fact, it was clearly carrying boxes marked “TNT (102).”

== Social cognition ==

In 2004, Prashant Bordia and Nicholas DiFonzo published their ''Problem Solving in Social Interactions on the Internet: Rumor As Social Cognition'' and found that rumor transmission is probably reflective of a "collective explanation process."&lt;ref name=internet&gt;{{cite journal  | last1= Bordia  | first1= Prashant  | author2= Nicolas DiFonzo  | title = Problem Solving in Social Interactions on the Internet: Rumor As Social Cognition  | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly  | volume = 67  | issue = 1  | pages = 33–49  | date = March 2004    | doi = 10.1177/019027250406700105| jstor=3649102}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion was based on an analysis of archived message board discussions in which the statements were coded and analyzed. It was found that 29% (the majority) of statements within these discussions could be coded as “sensemaking” statements, which involved, “[...] attempts at solving a problem.”&lt;ref name=internet/&gt;

It was noted that the rest of the discussion was constructed around these statements, further reinforcing the idea of collective problem solving. The researchers also found that each rumor went through a four-stage pattern of development in which a rumor was introduced for discussion, information was volunteered and discussed, and finally a resolution was drawn or interest was lost.&lt;ref name=internet/&gt;

For the study, archived discussions concerning rumors on the internet and other computer networks such as BITnet were retrieved. As a rule, each discussion had a minimum of five statements posted over a period of at least two days. The statements were then coded as being one of the following: ''prudent'', ''apprehensive'', ''authenticating'', ''interrogatory'', ''providing information'', ''belief'', ''disbelief'', ''sensemaking'', ''digressive'', or ''uncodable''. Each rumor discussion was then analyzed based on this coding system. A similar coding system based on statistical analysis was applied to each discussion as a whole, and the aforementioned four-stage pattern of rumor discussion emerged.

There are four components of managing rumors that both of you need to understand for the sake of your relationship’s success. The first, '''anxiety (situational and personality)''', is when people who either have a more anxious personality, or people who are in an anxiety- lifting situation are more likely to create rumors in order to relieve some of their insecurities. The second component of managing rumors is '''ambiguity'''. Ambiguity is when someone is not sure about what is going on, so they end up assuming the worst. The third component is '''information importance'''. . Information is key, and if that information is not juicy or if it does not interest people, there won’t be rumors, but information can often be false. Information can also be ambiguous. The last component of managing rumors is '''credibility.''' Rumors are often spread by sources that are not credible. A rumor itself is not credible unless it is proven to be true. That is why people say to never trust the tabloids. 

== Political communication strategy ==
Rumor has always played a major role in politics, with negative rumors about an opponent typically more effective than positive rumors about one's own side.&lt;ref&gt;David Coast and Jo Fox, "Rumour and Politics" ''History Compass'' (2015), 13#5 pp 222-234.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box|width=50%|align=right|quote="[[Propaganda]] is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for ideological, political or commercial purposes through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels. A propaganda organization employs propagandists who engage in propagandism—the applied creation and distribution of such forms of persuasion."|source=Richard Alan Nelson, ''A Chronology and Glossary of Propaganda in the United States'', 1996|}}
 
In the past, much research on rumor came from psychological approaches (as the discussion of Allport and DiFonzio demonstrates above). The focus was especially on how statements of questionable veracity (absolutely false to the ears of some listeners) circulated orally from person to person. Scholarly attention to political rumors is at least as old as Aristotle's ''Rhetoric''; however, not until recently has any sustained attention and conceptual development been directed at political uses of rumor, outside of its role in war situations. Almost no work had been done until recently on how different forms of media and particular cultural-historical conditions may facilitate a rumor's diffusion.&lt;ref name="propagandacritic.com"&gt;See the historical discussion by Dr. Aaron Delwiche at http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet's recent appearance as a new media technology has shown ever new possibilities for the fast diffusion of rumor, as the debunking sites such as snopes.com, urbanlegend.com, and factcheck.org demonstrate. Nor had previous research taken into consideration the particular form or style of deliberately chosen rumors for political purposes in particular circumstances (even though significant attention to the power of rumor for mass-media-diffused war propaganda has been in vogue since World War I; see Lasswell 1927).&lt;ref name="propagandacritic.com"/&gt; In the early part of the 21st century, some legal scholars have attended to political uses of rumor, though their conceptualization of it remains social psychological and their solutions to it as public problem are from a legal scholarly perspective, largely having to do with libel and privacy laws and the damage to personal reputations.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, Cass. 2009. On Rumors: How Falsehoods Spread, Why We Believe Them, What Can Be Done. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux; Solove, Daniel J. The Future of Reputation. New Haven: Yale University Press.Stowe, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working within political communication studies,  in 2006, Jayson Harsin&lt;ref&gt;Harsin, Jayson. The Rumour Bomb: Theorising the Convergence of New and Old Trends in Mediated US Politics [online]. Southern Review: Communication, Politics &amp; Culture; Volume 39, Issue 1; 2006; 84-110; http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=264848460677220;res=E-LIBRARY&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(reprinted in Michael Ryan (ed.). 2008. Cultural Studies: An Anthology. London: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of the "rumor bomb" as a response to the widespread empirical phenomenon of rumoresque communication in contemporary relations between [[media and politics]], especially within the complex convergence of multiple forms of media, from cell phones and internet, to radio, TV, and print. Harsin starts with the widespread definition of rumor as a claim whose truthfulness is in doubt and which often has no clear source even if its ideological or partisan origins and intents are clear. He then treats it as a particular rhetorical strategy in current contexts of media and politics in many societies. For Harsin a "rumor bomb" extends the definition of rumor into a political communication concept with the following features:
# A crisis of verification. - A crisis of verification is perhaps the most salient and politically dangerous aspect of rumor. Berenson (1952) defines rumor as a kind of persuasive message involving a proposition that lacks 'secure standards of evidence' (Pendleton 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Pendleton, S.c. (1998), 'Rumour research revisited and expanded', Language &amp; Communication, vol. 1. no. 18, pp. 69--86.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A context of public uncertainty or anxiety about a political group, figure, or cause, which the rumor bomb overcomes or transfers onto an opponent.
# A clearly partisan even if an anonymous source (e.g. "an unnamed advisor to the president"), which seeks to profit politically from the rumor bomb’s diffusion.
# A rapid diffusion via highly developed electronically mediated societies where news travels fast.

In addition, Harsin locates the "rumor bomb" within other communication genres, such as disinformation (intentional false information) and propaganda, as rumor has been viewed by others. However, he distinguishes it from these concepts as well, since disinformation is often too associated with government, and propaganda is attempts to control opinion without regard for ethics and accuracy of statement. Similarly, "[[Spin (public relations)|spin]]" is a generic term for strategic political communication that attempts to frame or re-frame an event or a statement in a way that is politically profitable for one side and detrimental to another, though at its core it may simply be a red herring (Bennett 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;130).&lt;ref&gt;W. Lance Bennett (2003), News: The Politics of an Illusion&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a "[[smear campaign]]" is a term that loosely means a coordinated effort to attack a person's character. Unlike a "smear campaign," rumor bombs need not be about discrediting a person (as is the case, for example, in claims about Iraq and 9/11 or weapons of mass destruction moved to Syria). “Spin” also specifically refers to an event and its re-framing. Rumor bombs may seek to produce events themselves.
 
A rumor bomb can be seen as having some characteristics of these general concepts, but rumor bombs happen in very particular cultural and historical conditions. They are not about mouth-to-ear interpersonal rumors as much rumor research has been interested in. They begin in a rapport between deliberate "disinformers" and ''media'', whether TV news, talk shows, newspapers, radio, or websites. They then circulate across these media, perhaps but not necessarily resulting in interpersonal mouth-to-ear rumor diffusion.&lt;ref name="Richard Pells 2003"&gt;For discussions of these trends in news and politics see John Corner and Richard Pells (eds.) 2003. Media and the Re-styling of Politics. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="French, i 2010"&gt;(see more recent developments of the concept and case studies in "Diffusing the Rumor John Kerry is French, i.e. Haughty, Cowardly, Foppish, Socialist and Gay," in R. Given and S. Soule eds. The Diffusion of Social Movements, New York: Cambridge University Press (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Harsin distinguishes the rumor bomb from other more general concepts of rumor by ''emphasizing changes in politics, media technology, and culture''. According to Harsin, rumor in politics has always existed, but recent changes have created an environment ripe for a new kind of political rumor: a new media "convergence culture" where information produced on the internet can influence the production of media content in other forms;new media technologies and business values that emphasize speed and circulation that combine with entertainment values in news, political marketing, and public craving of tabloid news that mirrors other entertainment genres.&lt;ref name="Richard Pells 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="French, i 2010"/&gt;

Rumors of affairs, of "weapons of mass destruction" and their alleged removal to other countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/saddams-wmd-moved-to-syria-an-israeli-says/24480/|title=Saddam's WMD Moved to Syria, An Israeli Says - The New York Sun|website=www.nysun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;"John Kerry is French,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/2/4/3/p172432_index.html?phpsessid=a4fd476ee1fbf0cc5ca97ef9fe864b88&lt;/ref&gt; Obama is a Muslim, John McCain had an illegitimate black child&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Richard H. | last=Davis | title=The anatomy of a smear campaign | date=21 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;—all of these involve statements whose veracity is in question or that are simply false. Other statements may have an ambiguous nature that makes them potentially appealing to different audiences who may interpret them in particular ways and circulate them. Harsin builds on rumor research that has emphasized social cognition and diffusion of propaganda. He extends Prashant and Difonzio's work in particular, since they attempt to distinguish rumor from [[gossip]], in that rumor is supposedly about public issues and gossip is about private, trivial things. The emergence of infotainment and tabloidization in especially American and British news has broken that distinction, since politics is now just as much about bringing the private into the public view, as was clear with the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.

==Strategic communication==

Similar to their appearance and function in political communication, wherein rumors can be deployed for specific deleterious effect (rumor bomb) or can otherwise plague a candidate for office, rumors also play an important role in [[strategic communication]]. Strategic communication is the process of crafting messages in support of specific organizational goals, and is usually concerned with governments, militaries and Non-Governmental Organizations ([[NGO]]s).  Adroit strategic communication requires an understanding of stories, trends and memes circulating within a culture.

Rumors can be viewed as stories that seem rational but that are steeped into speculation, in connection with a certain narrative landscape (the vast array of cultural expression circulating within a community or region).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel Leonard Bernardi, Pauline Hope Cheong, Chris Lundry, and Scott W.

Ruston coin the term [[narrative IED]] to help explain the function and danger of rumors in a strategic communication context. Rumors, as narrative IEDs, are low-cost, low-tech communication weapons that can be used by anyone to disrupt the efforts of communication, civil affairs or outreach campaigns such as those undertaken by governments in crisis response situations or militaries in insurgencies. As Bernardi notes, “"Like their explosive cousins, rumors can be created and planted by nearly anybody, require limited resources to utilize, can be deadly for those in its direct path, and can instill fear”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Asimov|first=Nanette|title=Researchers help U.S. military track, defuse rumors|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-10-14/news/30282265_1_rumors-low-tech-aliens|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2011-10-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121004325/http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-10-14/news/30282265_1_rumors-low-tech-aliens|archivedate=2012-01-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''set list''', or most commonly, '''setlist''', is typically a handwritten or printed document that is created as a blueprint for a performance that lists the order of songs, jokes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creativestandup.com/setlist-remember-performance/|title=http://creativestandup.com/setlist-remember-performance/|website=creativestandup.com|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, stories or other performance elements that an artist intends to play, or has played, during a specific performance. (In the case of music concerts, the popular website [https://www.setlist.fm/ setlist.fm], specifically defines a setlist to be the list of the songs a band or artist actually played during a concert).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/about|title=About {{!}} setlist.fm|website=www.setlist.fm|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A set list can be made of nearly any material that can be written or printed on, but are most commonly made with [[paper]], [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]], or [[Card stock|cardstock]]. They are also often [[laminate|laminated]] as well, especially for outdoor stage settings. The set list is usually taped directly to the [[stage (theatre)|stage]] in front of the performers, or somewhere the musicians can see it, such as to a monitor or amplifier.

Artists use setlists for a variety of reasons beyond just being a reminder of the order in which their material is to be played during a performance. They are most often used to help the artist or band to create the overall mood of a live performance by allowing them to create a memorable sense of range and variety in the tone, tempo, and dynamics within their performance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://diymusician.cdbaby.com/musician-tips/the-art-of-the-set-list-choosing-the-right-songs-in-the-right-order/|title=The Art of the Set List: Choosing the Right Songs in the Right Order - DIY Musician Blog|date=2013-08-19|work=DIY Musician Blog|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is often a factor in creating great performances that fans will talk about for years if not generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://glidemagazine.com/170268/wilco-tap-creative-setlist-schmilco-songs-rarities-fan-favorites-portland-show-review/|title=https://glidemagazine.com/170268/wilco-tap-creative-setlist-schmilco-songs-rarities-fan-favorites-portland-show-review/|website=glidemagazine.com|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also used to create sets for a specific audience or location, an increasingly popular idea that is aided by the use of today's technologies like the use of instant polling on social media and websites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/27/metallica-european-tour-fans-pick-setlist|title=Metallica ask fans to pick their setlist|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=2013-11-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where fans can choose the material to be performed.  

Many performers also craft their playlists in ways that highlight other elements of their stage shows such as the visual ambience of the stage, choreography, or in an order that defines things like different albums or eras of their career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagomag.com/arts-culture/August-2018/The-Chicago-Choreographer-Behind-Smashing-Pumpkins-Reunion-Tour/|title=The Chicago Choreographer Behind Smashing Pumpkins’ Reunion Tour|work=Chicago magazine|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.setlist.fm/news/10-18/a-look-inside-david-byrnes-american-utopia-tour-4bd6bbca|title=A Look Inside David Byrne's American Utopia Tour|work=setlist.fm|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music fans also refer to the set list in the non-physical sense of what a performing artist chooses to play.  For many artists, the same set list is played for every performance on a given [[concert tour]].  For others this is not necessarily the case, and for their devoted fan bases who follow the artist around on tour, the most variety in the set list from night to night is longed for. The [[Grateful Dead]] are one example, having never played the same set list twice in the band's entire existence. Some such artists have predetermined "slots" in an otherwise mostly fixed show where different songs can be swapped in and out; other artists guarantee that the same song will not be played two shows in a row; and still other artists such as [[Van Morrison]] use no predetermined set list at all.

Websites exist to track and report statistics on the played set lists of those artists who change them from night to night.   In the case of devoted fan bases such as for [[Bruce Springsteen]], in the pre-smartphone era fans attending concerts took on the assigned role of "set list caller", periodically calling out or text-messaging from a [[cell phone]] to a friend, to report the most recent songs played, with the friend then updating a running set list on one of several [[Internet forums]].  In the smartphone era, such fans could update the sites themselves or put out running commentaries on [[Twitter]].

Collecting setlists has become nearly as popular for music fans as collecting ticket stubs and show posters, with the actual physical setlist becoming a treasured and uniquely rare souvenir for concert goers and fans of music in general&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2013/11/11/244014650/question-of-the-week-do-you-collect-setlists|title=Gallery: The Setlists We've Nabbed|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fans often wait around after a concert just so they can grab one off the stage after a performance or so they can try requesting one from a [[roadie]] or other crew member. Crew members also sometimes keep items like setlists, guitar picks, and drum sticks for themselves, or so that they can sell them on websites such as [[eBay]], where dedicated music fans and concert attendees who are looking to the highlight their own experience of a particular show can purchase them for their own collection.

In some cases, so great is the urge for a fan to obtain a setlist that they don't always wait for a show to end before trying to get their hands on a setlist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/video-sebastian-bach-stops-show-after-fan-steals-setlist-injures-fellow-concertgoer/|title=Video: SEBASTIAN BACH Stops Show After Fan Steals Setlist, Injures Fellow Concertgoer|date=2015-06-17|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Performances==

===Fashion and stage===

Shila Amzah Love Live in Malaysia marked Shila Amzah's first ever solo concert to be organized in Malaysia. Her makeup for the night was provided by Fiza Zainuddin while her dresses were designed by Raffiey Nasir.

===Synopsis===

As the kick start of the show, Shila began her first performance with “Yang Teristimewa” and “Bebaskan/Ada Sahaja”. She has composed and written these songs at a very young age as one of the songs was actually created by her at the age of 13 years old. Throughout the show, Shila has spoken in multiple languages including Malay, Chinese and English so that all of her audiences could understand her. She also said that, regardless of the races who have attended the concert, everyone is actually one big family.

Shila then proceeded with the song which has made everyone knows her, Zheng Fu. All of the fans were mesmerized by her powerful vocal. She has totally conquered the heart of the audiences with her wonderful voice.

She has altered some of the song lyrics and even mixed-and-matched different versions or languages of songs during her performance on stage. The most prominent one is during her performance of “Ji De. Shila has sung cover for “Ji De” in Malay version before. During her concert this time, she has mixed the Mandarin version as well as Malay version together.

During Shila Amzah Love Live in Shanghai, she has invited Evan Guo as her guest artist. In Shila Amzah Love Live in Malaysia Concert, she has invited a James Yang, who is famous for his song, “Long Time No See". They have performed that song together on stage. After their duet, James have also performed another song titled “忘了我是谁”. During this song, he has come down from the stage to interact with the audiences.

During the concert, Shila has also surprised the audience by performing K-pop song by EXO titled Overdose. She said that language is not a barrier for music.

During her participation in I Am a Singer (season 2)，her performance of "Xiang Ni De Ye" has amazed all of the audiences including the original singer himself. Besides this song, she also sang "Zui Chang De Dian Ying" which she has also performed during I Am a Singer (season 2).

During the concert, she has featured a medley consisting of [[Wang Lee Hom]]’s songs. Besides, she has also done a medley performance of [[Beyoncé]]’s Songs! She danced along with the dancers during the medley. Medias describe it as "Her performance during this medley was very energetic and lively!".

During her concert, she has interacted a lot with the fans and some of her speech were really hilarious. For example, she told the fans regarding how much she likes Wang LeeHom and she jokingly said that she was very sad when she knew that he was married. She asked the audiences whether she has really gained some weights because a few netizen commented on her social media that she’s fat. Well, the audiences replied, “No!”. Hearing the response, she jokingly replied that she could eat without much worries then.

Afterwards, Shila gave a speech regarding patriotism as well as love during her performance of “Warisan”. She said that while she was dedicating the song for her beloved country, the real dedication of the song was for her father. She has invited her father to go on stage to sing with her.

After Shila’s performance of her which is "Memori Tercipta", the audiences did not leave the hall and they screamed for an encore. Without disappointing the fans, Shila came back on stage with her song "Patah Seribu" which was blended with her Mandarin version, "Xia Yi Bu". All of the fans have gathered closer to the stage during the performance of this song. Shila has taken a selfie on stage with all of her fans as the background.

'''''The Pinkerton Labor Spy''''' (alternately, '''''The Pinkerton's Labor Spy''''') is a nonfiction book published in 1907 as an exposé of intrigue and abuses by the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton Detective Agency]] in general, and by chief agent [[James McParland]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pinkerton's Labor Spy |last=Friedman |first=Morris  |authorlink=Morris Friedman |year=1907 |publisher= Wilshire Book Company |oclc=11342350}}  [https://books.google.com/books?id=6rQBAAAAYAAJ Full-text version, Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book detailed the use of spies by mining and ore milling companies during the period of the [[Colorado Labor Wars]]. It described the recruiting, utilization, and management of agents who infiltrated the [[Western Federation of Miners]] and the [[United Mine Workers]] unions for the purposes of disruption, sabotage, and gathering information.

The author of the book, [[Morris Friedman]], had worked in the agency as Mr. McParland's stenographer.

==Other criticism==

''The Pinkerton Labor Spy'' criticized the Pinkerton Detective Agency from a pro-labor point of view. [[Charlie Siringo]], another former employee of the agency, had no sympathy for labor, yet wrote books about his experiences as a Pinkerton Detective that were so objectionable to the company, they were repeatedly suppressed. In 1936, the [[La Follette Committee]] of the United States Senate investigated and publicized abuses of detective agencies, including Pinkerton. The Pinkerton Agency eventually shifted from detective work to security services, at least in part due to such criticism.

==History==
Vague metamorphosed from an earlier proto-club night called the Kit Kat Club at Arcadia operated by Suzy Mason&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Warehouse: Leeds nightclub memories|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/the-warehouse-leeds-nightclub-memories-1-2246028|website=28 May 2010|publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post Newspaper|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.paulfryer.net/paulFbiog.html Paul Fryer]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Martin|title=Art: Paul Fryer's Pieta at the Cathedral of Gap|url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/the-ticket/2009/04/art-paul-fryers-pieta-at-the-c.html|website=15 April 2009|publisher=The Daily Mirror Newspaper|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;(former lead-singer of [[1980s in music|eighties]] [[electropop]] group Bazooka Joe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist: Bazooka Joe|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/147321-Bazooka-Joe-2|website=1989|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fryer and Mason then in brought in [[Nick Raphael]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Johnny|title=White Collar Rock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/12/popandrock1|website=12 October 2008|publisher=The Guardian Newspaper|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and debuted Vague at the High Flyers club in Leeds on 10 April 1993, before moving to The Warehouse a month later. Vague blended [[kitsch]] with the artistic and [[theatrical]]; its outlandish theme and costume parties included a recreation of a day-night out at [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach]] only inside the club that was believed to have been filled entirely with beach sand, parasols and miniature [[fair|fairground rides]], a retake on [[Garden at Buckingham Palace#Garden parties|royal garden parties]] that was held annually and an evening with [[Vera Duckworth]] a fictional character from the [[Coronation Street|British soap opera ''Coronation Street'']].
The club is credited as being the first in the UK to advertise itself as "mixed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collard|first1=James|title=United Kingdom of Dance|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/united-kingdom-of-dance-if-the-capitals-clubs-are-too-cool-for-comfort-the-rest-of-the-country-is-steaming-on-a-saturday-night-says-james-collard-1443970.html|website=20 October 1994|publisher=The Daily Telegraph Newspaper|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;– ''i.e.'' for [[Homosexuality|homosexual]], [[heterosexual]] and [[Polysexuality|polysexual]] patrons equally, however the claim is not entirely true for example the promoter [[Leigh Bowery]] and creator of the [[Bowery#Taboo|Taboo Club night]] in London in 1985 could be credited with embracing poly-sexual identities in club culture at a much earlier date. Although the vetting of customers on the door at Vague was notoriously strict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Almond|first1=Kevin Dr|title=Masquerade in Clubland: A Safe Space for Glamour|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/11442/3/AlmondMasquerade.pdf|website=2011|publisher=Routledge Oxford UK|accessdate=28 February 2015|ref=pp 3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120757/http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/11442/3/AlmondMasquerade.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example it was rumored on some occasions that visiting male heterosexual customers were asked to dress up as a woman, then come back to the club or passionately kiss another male customer in-front of door staff, to prove they held no prejudices. Once inside, the atmosphere was one of tolerance, [[hedonism]], and [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]]. The British music newspaper ''[[Melody Maker]]'' featured Vague in 1994 in a review called "For Frocks Sake" and described the club as a "Dance Equivalent of Andy Warhol's [[The Factory]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Maker Crew spent last weekend sizing up the nations most exciting clubs|url=https://archivedmusicpress.wordpress.com/category/live-reviews/|website=22 January 1994|publisher=Melody Maker Music Newspaper|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' journalist Tim Willis depicted the scene inside of the club as one of "[[Bacchanalia|Bacchanalian excess]]" for the feature "Up North Where Anything Goes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Almond|first1=Kevin Dr|title=Diversity in Clubland: A Safe Space for Glamour,|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/11540/4/AlmondDiversity.pdf|website=2011|publisher=University of Huddersfield UK, pp9|accessdate=2 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124412/http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/11540/4/AlmondDiversity.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneering ethos that was behind Vague is what made it so successful years before any other club in the UK adopted a similar [[safe-space]] approach, according to Richard Smith speaking in 2006 then editor of [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] leading gay publication ''[[Gay Times]]'' on the banning by the [[UK government]] of gay straight door policies he stated "one of the most important clubs of the 90s was Trannies With Attitude Vague in Leeds. They – quite consciously – started and worked at building up a big mixed, polysexual club night, and succeeded”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bui|first1=Paul|title=Gay straight door policies banned in the UK|url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/25355/Gay_straight_door_policies_banned_in_the_UK|website=6 March 2006|publisher=In the Mix Music Magazine Australia|accessdate=2 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142720/http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/25355/Gay_straight_door_policies_banned_in_the_UK|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notoriety of Vague during this period helped to put Leeds firmly on the international club scene radar along with the city's other major [[house music]] venue, [[Dave Beer#Back To Basics Promoter|Back to Basics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haj-Najafi|first1=Daryoush|title=Invisible Hand: Hip, Leeds|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/fashion-uk-interview-inivisble-hand-hip-leeds|website=2 December 2011|publisher=Vice Webzine|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Vague sound==
The club played a mixture of '[[Handbag house]]'', ''[[hard house]]'', [[hard trance]] and [[Disco|Classic and electronic Disco]] music played on the main dance floor, with a more eclectic selection of music played on the upper floor such as [[Glam punk]], [[Musical theatre|Musical's]].[[Soul music|Rare Soul]] and [[Jazz|Jazz Styles]]. Resident DJ's TWA particularly championed  "[[Techno|Techno Disco]]" or "tesko" (for legal reasons) a brand of disco house at the club. A number of Vague anthems included TWA's "Disco Biscuit" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Various - Vague (Now &amp; Then)|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Vague-Now-Then/release/1543702|website=Discogs|publisher=EMI Records Ltd.|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=en|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Nasty Girl's", Atlantic Ocean's "Waterfall", [[Björk|Björk's]], [[Big Time Sensuality]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Various - Vague (Now &amp; Then)|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Vague-Now-Then/release/1543702|website=Discogs|publisher=EMI Records Ltd.|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=en|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Lisa lisa cult jam|Lisa lisa cult jam's]], [[Let the Beat Hit 'Em]], [[WestBam|WestBam's]], [[Wizards of the Sonic]], [[Fierce Ruling Diva|Fierce Ruling Diva's]], "Get Funky" and [[D.

TESKO has been defined as [[Techno]] with sex put into it; in other words encapsulating the power of Techno then adding in [[Funk music|Funk]] and the love of [[Disco|Classic Disco]].

==DJs==
Original resident [[disk jockey|DJs]] included Fryer and Raphael as "TWA"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discogs Artist Credits|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/46227-TWA?type=Credits|website=2014|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;(styled as "Trannies With Attitude"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flick|first1=Larry|title=Flying with TWA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=TWA+trannies+with+attitued&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6WF8wd2yW4&amp;sig=_wcs4EPvRx2J8TQNTtUpQtGurhY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pU7xVLrDEMPguQS_toLwBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=TWA%20trannies%20with%20attitued&amp;f=false|website=7 January 1995|publisher=Billboard Magazine|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "The World is Androgynous") and Phil Faversham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Team|url=http://www.hedkandi.com/partiesfolder/team_member/phil_faversham.aspx|website=2014|publisher=Hed Kandi|accessdate=5 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607003034/http://www.hedkandi.com/partiesfolder/team_member/phil_faversham.aspx|archive-date=7 June 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; later residents included [[Anne Savage (DJ)|Anne Savage]] Curtis Zack, Daisy &amp; Havoc.

==Door host==
The host who ran the door at Vague was ‘Madame JoJo’ also known as ‘Lady JoJo Queen of the GoGo’, she was also a member of TWA and featured in the Music Video for their song ‘Nasty Girls’, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rachel McAlley: JoJo|url=http://leedscitymagazine.co.uk/rachel-mcalley-jojo/|website=leedscitymagazine.co.uk|publisher=Leeds City Magazine, 2017|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Final year==
In April 1996 a boxed double compilation [[Compact disc|CD]] - ''Vague - Now &amp; Then'' - was released, its accompanying booklet detailing the history of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vague Now &amp; Then|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Vague-Now-Then/release/1543702|website=15 April 1996|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The night ended after Vague&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guest Hayden|first1=Anthony|title=Paul Fryer In Conversation With Anthony Haden-guest|url=http://magazine.saatchiart.com/articles/artnews/paul_fryer_in_conversation_wit|website=5 November 2008|publisher=Saatchi Art Magazine|accessdate=1 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114746/http://magazine.saatchiart.com/articles/artnews/paul_fryer_in_conversation_wit|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrated its third birthday at the Warehouse on 14 September 1996.
