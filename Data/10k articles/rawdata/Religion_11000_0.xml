      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3140">'''Abraham ben Yechiel-Michel Catz Ha Cohen of Lask''' (Yechiel-Michel was the grandson of the martyr Yechiel-Michel Ha Cohen of Nemirov). Abraham was a Jewish ascetic who flourished at the end of the 18th century. He went to live at [[Jerusalem]] in 1785, but afterward traveled through Europe as an agent for the collection of donations for the [[Polish Jews]] in the [[Land of Israel|Eretz Yisrael]], making [[Amsterdam]] his center; he died as Hakam at [[Safed]], during a riot against the Jews, who had protested against excessive taxation. Another version says he was punished by the Turks, in Jerusalem, (see below) and died in Safed, in 1799, there he was buried. He did not have children.

Abraham (brother of Samuel Catz of Lask) was an ascetic of a remarkable type; he fasted six days of the week, from [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] night to Sabbath eve, but feasted quite luxuriously on the Sabbath. Often he devoted entire days and nights to the study of the Torah, standing upright during that time. He took his daily ablutions in the river before offering his prayers in the morning, often breaking through the ice in winter for this purpose. Yet in spite of all this austerity he was a man of uncommon vigor.

Once in the [[Holy Land]], together with a number of Jewish scholars, Abraham was dragged to prison by some Turkish officials, and subjected to the [[bastinado]], for no other reason than that it was the usual method pursued by the Turkish government for extorting money from the Jews. Abraham and another rabbi alone survived. At every stroke received Abraham uttered the rabbinic phrase, גם זו לטובה ("This, too, is for the best"). He was held in reverence by the best men of the time as "the holy man of God."

He published several [[kabalistic]] homilies, one under the title of ''Weshab ha-Kohen'' (The Priest Shall Return), Leghorn, 1788; another, ''Wechishab lo ha-Kohen'' (The Priest Shall Reckon), Fürth, 1784; a third, ''Bet Ya'akob'' (Jacob's House), Leghorn, 1792; and a fourth, ''Ayin Panim ba-Torah'' (Seventy Meanings of the Law), Warsaw, 1797. The last work gives seventy reasons for the order of the sections in the [[Pentateuch]], as well as seventy reasons why the Law begins, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" ([[Gen.]] i.1). All are filled with fantastic numerical and alphabetical combinations.

{{Italic title}}
In [[church history]], the term '''''{{lang|la|acephali}}''''' (from [[Ancient Greek]]: ἀκέφαλοι ''akephaloi'', "headless", singular ἀκέφαλος ''akephalos'' from ἀ- ''a-'', "without", and κεφαλή ''kephalé'', "head") has been applied to several sects that supposedly had no leader. [[E. Cobham Brewer]] wrote, in ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'', that acephalites, "properly means men without a head."&lt;ref name="Brewer1900"&gt;{{Source-attribution|{{cite encyclopedia|location=London|publisher=Cassell|encyclopedia=Dictionary of phrase and fable : giving the derivation, source, or origin of common phrases, allusions, and words that have a tale to tell|edition=New|year=1900|oclc=586047493|last=Brewer|first=E. Cobham|authorlink=E. Cobham Brewer|title=Acephalites|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-DQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=2014-10-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Cooper wrote, in ''Dictionary of Christianity'', that it characterizes "various schismatical Christian bodies".&lt;ref name="Cooper2013"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|location=New York [u.a.]|publisher=Routledge|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Christianity|edition=eBook|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Jean C.|editor-link=|year=2013|origyear=1996|isbn=978-1-315-07404-7|title=Acephalites|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZC3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=2014-10-22}} This is "based on the Christian references taken from Brewer's ''Dictionary of phrase and fable''".&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were [[Nestorians]] who rejected the [[Council of Ephesus]] condemnation of [[Patriarch Nestorius of Constantinople]],&lt;ref name="Cooper2013" /&gt; which deposed Nestorius and declared him a [[heretic]].

==Fifth-century ''acephali''==

Those who refused to acknowledge the authority of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] were originally called Haesitantes; the ''{{lang|la|Acephali}}'' developed from among them, and, according to Blunt, the earlier name – Haesitantes – seems to have been used for only a short time.&lt;ref name="Blunt1874"&gt;{{Source-attribution|{{cite encyclopedia|location=London|publisher=Rivingtons|encyclopedia=Dictionary of sects, heresies, ecclesiastical parties, and schools of religious thought|year=1874|oclc=752973510|editor-last=Blunt|editor-first=John H.|editor-link=John Henry Blunt|pages=109, 
|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofsect00blunuoft|accessdate=2014-10-23}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=180}}

With the apparent purpose of bringing the Orthodox and heretics into unity, [[Patriarch Peter III of Alexandria]] and [[Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople]] had elaborated a new [[creed]] in which they expressly condemned both Nestorius and [[Eutyches]], a [[presbyter]] and [[archimandrite]], but at the same time rejected the decisions of the Council of Chalcedon.&lt;ref name="Becket1907" /&gt; This ambiguous formula, though approved by [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and imposed in his ''[[Henoticon]]'', could only satisfy the indifferent.&lt;ref name="Becket1907" /&gt;

The term applied to a 5th-century faction among the [[Eutychians]], who seceded from Peter, a Monophysite or more accurately a [[Miaphysite]], in 482,&lt;ref name="Becket1907"&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Acephali|last=A'Becket|first=John J.|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Peter signed the ''Henoticon'' and was recognised by Zeno as the legitimate patriarch of Alexandria by which they were "deprived of their head".&lt;ref name="Brewer1900" /&gt;
{{citation needed span|text=They remained "without king or bishop"{{Cite quote|date=October 2014}} until they were reconciled with [[Coptic Orthodox]] [[Pope Mark II of Alexandria]] (799–819).|date=October 2014}}
The condemnation of Eutyches irritated the rigid Monophysites; the equivocal attitude taken towards the Council of Chalcedon appeared to them insufficient, and many of them, especially the monks, deserted Peter, preferring to be without a head, rather than remain in communion with him.&lt;ref name="Becket1907" /&gt;
Later, they joined the adherents of the non-Chalcedonian Patriarch [[Severus of Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Becket1907" /&gt;
They were, according to ''[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]'', a "group of extreme Monophysites"&lt;ref name="OEDOnline-acephali"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|publisher=Oxford University Press|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary Online|edition=September 2014|title=acephali, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/1347|accessdate=2014-10-23|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "were absorbed by the Jacobites".&lt;ref name="Cooper2013" /&gt;

[[Liberatus of Carthage]] wrote, in ''{{lang|la|Breviarium causae Nestorianorum et Eutychianorum}}'', that those at the [[Council of Ephesus]] who followed neither [[Patriarch Cyril I of Alexandria]] nor [[Patriarch John I of Antioch]] were called ''{{lang|la|Acephali}}''.&lt;ref name="Becket1907" /&gt;

Esaianites were one of the sects into which the Alexandrian ''{{lang|la|Acephali}}'' separated at the end of the 5th century. They were the followers of Esaias, a deacon of Palestine, who claimed to have been consecrated to the episcopal office by the Bishop Eusebius. His opponents averred that after the bishop's death his hands had been laid upon the head of Esaias by some of his friends.&lt;ref name="Blunt1874" /&gt;{{rp|page=148}}

''{{lang|la|Paulitae}}'' were a sect of ''{{lang|la|Acephali}}'' who followed Chalcedonian [[Patriarch Paul of Alexandria]], who was deposed by a synod at Gaza, in 541, for his uncanonical consecration by the Patriarch of Constantinople, and who, after his deposition, sided with the Miaphysites.&lt;ref name="Blunt1874" /&gt;{{rp|page=415}}{{efn|They are mentioned as Paulianists in a treatise on the reception of heretics written by [[Patriarch Timothy I of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Blunt1874" /&gt;{{rp|page=415}}}}

Barsanians, later called Semidalites, were a sect of ''{{lang|la|Acephali}}'' at the end of the 5th century. They had no succession of priests, and professed to keep up the celebration of a valid Eucharist by placing a few crumbs of some of the bread which had been consecrated by [[Antipope Dioscorus|Dioscorus]] into a vessel of meal, and then using as fully consecrated the bread baked from it.&lt;ref name="Blunt1874" /&gt;{{rp|page=551}}

==Other ''acephali''==

According to Brewer, acephalites were also certain bishops exempt from the jurisdiction and discipline of their patriarch.&lt;ref name="Brewer1900" /&gt; Cooper explains that they are "priests rejecting episcopal authority or bishops that of their metropolitans."&lt;ref name="Cooper2013" /&gt; Blunt described ''{{lang|la|clerici acephali}}'' as those clergy who were ordained with a [[sinecure]] [[benefice]] and who generally obtained their orders by paying for them, that is by [[simony]]. The Council of Pavia, in 853, legislated its canons 18 and 23 against them, from which it appears, according to Blunt, that they were mostly chaplains to noblemen, that they produced much scandal in the Church, and that they disseminated many errors.&lt;ref name="Blunt1874" /&gt;{{rp|page=109}}

{{citation needed span|text=In the [[Middle Ages]] the term denoted ''{{lang|la|[[clerici vagantes]]}}'',|date=October 2014}} clergy without title or benefice.

According to Brewer, acephalites were also a sect of [[Levellers]] during the reign of [[Henry I of England]] who acknowledged no leader.&lt;ref name="Brewer1900" /&gt; They were, according to ''Oxford English Dictionary Online'', "a group of free [[socager]]s having no [[feudal]] superior except the [[king]]." This usage is now considered obsolete.&lt;ref name="OEDOnline-acephali" /&gt;

Fabled human-like creatures in [[Greek mythology]], analogous to [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''{{lang|la|[[Blemmyes (legendary creatures)|Blemmyae]]}}'', without heads and with facial features on their torsos, were also called ''{{lang|la|Acephali}}''.&lt;ref name="Brewer1900" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OEDOnline-acephali" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|location=London|publisher=Harper Element|encyclopedia=The Element encyclopedia of magical creatures : the ultimate a-z of fantastic beings from myth and magic|year=2005|isbn=0-00-720873-1|last1=Matthews|first1=John|last2=Matthews|first2=Caitlin|title=Acephali|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHrJ6UmlJLcC&amp;pg=PT35|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book discussing [[new religious movement]]s and the [[New Age]] movement, written by Ruth A. Tucker.&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt;  The book was published in 1989 by [[Zondervan]],&lt;ref name="OCLC1"/&gt;  a Christian publishing house.&lt;ref name="Mission"/&gt;  Another edition was released by the same publisher in 2004.&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt;

==Author==
Ruth A. Tucker is a former professor of [[missiology]] with a [[PhD]] from [[Northern Illinois University]].&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt;  Tucker has taught alternative religions at both the graduate and undergraduate level.&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt;  Her book ''Daughters of the Church'' was published in 1987.&lt;ref name="OCLC2"/&gt;  In 2000, Tucker was a professor at [[Calvin Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref name="HCharles"/&gt;  Tucker authored the book ''Walking Away from Faith'' in 2002.&lt;ref name="OCLC3"/&gt;

==Title==
The title "Another Gospel" is taken from [[Paul (apostle)|Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians]] in the [[New Testament]] verses 1:6-8: "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."&lt;ref name="McKnight2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 1:6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
''Another Gospel'' discusses a wide range of groups, including [[Mormonism]], [[Seventh-day Adventism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christian Science]], [[New Thought]] and [[Unity Church|Unity]], the [[Worldwide Church of God]], the [[Way International]], the [[Children of God (religious group)|Children of God]], the [[Unification Church]], [[ISKCON|Hare Krishnas]], [[Bahá'ís]], and [[Scientology]].&lt;ref name="TOC"/&gt;  Other groups, including [[Rosicrucianism]] and [[Swedenborgianism]], are described in appendices.&lt;ref name="zondervan"/&gt;  Tucker discusses some of the controversies as related to these groups,&lt;ref name="Selverstone"/&gt;   while adding that frequently new religions maintain an "ability to reach out and meet the needs of people who are suffering and dejected."&lt;ref name="CohenBoyer"/&gt;

Tucker writes about the New Age movement, "The most popular and widely publicized new religion in recent years has been the New Age movement, a difficult-to-define variety of mystical, spiritualistic, and occultic groups that above all else are not ''new''. From channeling crystals to harmonic convergence, celebrities and ordinary citizens have been captivated by this increasingly popular religious trend."&lt;ref name="Nash"/&gt;  Tucker asks: "Is New Age merely an age-old form of the occult that will taper off in popularity as the fad loses its luster, or is it truly a movement that has only barely begun to make its all-encompassing mark on the world?"&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt; and warns that "every individual concerned about maintaining traditional Christian values should be apprehensive about the potential negative effect the New Age may have on the coming generations."&lt;ref name="Melton" /&gt;

In discussion of the Unification Church, Tucker writes that the organization has used controversial recruitment tactics which subsequently resulted in college students dropping out of universities in order to join it.&lt;ref name="gilfand"/&gt;  "The recruitment strategy of the Unification Church was widely criticized for utilizing tactics that sometimes were compared to brainwashing techniques," writes Tucker.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto"/&gt;  ''Another Gospel'' describes how Unification Church founder [[Sun Myung Moon]] stated that he was told by [[Jesus Christ]] to complete a task in which Jesus had not succeeded, and carry out the desires of God on the earth.&lt;ref name="gilfand" /&gt;

Tucker notes a disparity between approaches to religious movements abroad compared to within a person's own cultural milieu.&lt;ref name="hexham" /&gt;  "In cross-cultural evangelism overseas, missionaries are admonished not to ridicule other religious beliefs or practices. ... Yet, these 'cross-cultural' courtesies are often blatantly ignored when they pertain to situations within our own culture. We often ridicule or mock the unorthodox religious beliefs of people in our own communities, because ''cultists'' do not deserve respect," writes Tucker.&lt;ref name="hexham"/&gt;

''Another Gospel'' delves into the difficulty in defining cults.&lt;ref name="gomes"/&gt;  Tucker says that a cult is "a religious group that has a 'prophet'-founder called of God to give a special message not found in the Bible itself".&lt;ref name="gomes" /&gt;  She comments on the defining characteristics utilized by [[sociologist]]s, who "have tended to define cults more in terms of lifestyle, proselytizing practices, and authoritarian leadership, rather than in terms of belief or by any standard of orthodoxy".&lt;ref name="gomes" /&gt;  According to Tucker cults often have a "prophet-founder" who serves as a "legalistic, authoritarian leader".&lt;ref name="gomes" /&gt;  In her given definition of a cult, Tucker writes, "In deference to this charismatic leader ... the style of leadership is authoritarian and there is frequently an exlusivistic outlook supported by a legalistic lifestyle and persecution mentality. ... It is the attribute of a prophet-founder that very distinctly separates cults from denominations."&lt;ref name="gomes" /&gt;

According to the description of the book from the publisher, Tucker "explains how ... alternative religious movements appear to meet people's needs."&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt; Tucker concludes that "the increase in cult membership is a direct result of a failure on the part of the church."&lt;ref name="Rhodes"/&gt;

== Reception ==
Charles H. Lippy, writing in ''Modern American Popular Religion: A Critical Assessment and Annotated Bibliography'', stated that ''Another Gospel'' is written "from a decidedly conservative Christian perspective", and although Tucker "does not ridicule the groups she seeks to expose ... it is clear that [she] does not see the groups she studies as legitimate religious alternatives."&lt;ref name="Lippy" /&gt;

[[Robert M. Bowman, Jr.]], reviewing ''Another Gospel'' for the ''[[Christian Research Journal]]'', commented: "Although Tucker is at her best in recounting the histories of the religions she surveys, at places she is not critical enough of the historical accounts that have been published by the cults themselves."  Bowman's review concluded, "... Ruth Tucker's ''Another Gospel'' is, in several respects, the best general textbook on the cults. It is more up-to-date, more readable, and more respectful of the cults than any other such textbook. But, because it is lacking in biblical critiques of the cults (which is understandable, given the author's areas of expertise), it cannot replace those books which do provide such critiques, however much fresh treatments are needed."&lt;ref name="bowman" /&gt;

A review of the book for the ''Journal of Christian Nursing'', said that the book provides information about "what people in various cults and religious groups believe", and called the book "outstanding", and recommended it for personal libraries and church libraries. The reviewer commented: "Although designed as a reference book, it is hard to put down. I started dipping into sections that interested me, then sat down and read the whole book. In the process, I felt as if I'd taken a semester course in alternative religions."&lt;ref name="jas" /&gt;

Author [[James Penton|M. James Penton]] wrote positively of the book, in his book ''Apocalypse Delayed'' published by [[University of Toronto Press]]. He wrote that Tucker's chapter on [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] "is far more superior to most older books and articles produced by Catholic and Protestant critics of the Watch Tower movement."&lt;ref name="penton" /&gt;

In a discussion of the prevalence of belief in [[reincarnation]] among adherents of various belief systems, ''Theology for the Community of God'' author [[Stanley Grenz|Stanley J. Grenz]] recommended Tucker's book "for references to the presence of this doctrine in the New Age movement".&lt;ref name="Grenz"/&gt;

[[Image:Damarri001.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Djabugay people|Djabugay]] language group's mythical being, ''Damarri'', transformed into a mountain range, is seen lying on his back above the [[Barron Gorge National Park|Barron River Gorge]], looking upwards to the skies, within north-east Australia's wet tropical forested landscape.]]

'''Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology''' (also known as [[Dreamtime]] or Dreaming stories, [[songlines]], or Aboriginal [[oral literature]]) are the stories [[ritual|traditionally performed]] by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1994) "Oral Literature" in Horton, David (General Editor)&lt;/ref&gt; within each of the [[language group]]s across Australia.

All such [[myth]]s variously "tell significant truths within each Aboriginal group's local [[cultural landscape|landscape]]. They effectively layer the whole of the Australian continent's [[topography]] with cultural nuance and deeper meaning, and empower selected audiences with the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back to [[time immemorial]]".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1995) "An Approach to Ensure Continuity and Transmission of the Rainforest Peoples' Oral Tradition", in Fourmile, H; Schnierer, S.; &amp; Smith, A. (Eds) ''An Identification of Problems and Potential for Future Rainforest Aboriginal Cultural Survival and Self-Determination in the Wet Tropics.'' Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Participation Research and Development. Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

David Horton's ''[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]'' contains an article on Aboriginal mythology observing:&lt;ref name="BERN001"&gt;Berndt, C. (1994) "Mythology" in David Horton (General Editor)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A mythic map of Australia would show thousands of characters, varying in their importance, but all in some way connected with the land. Some emerged at their specific sites and stayed spiritually in that vicinity. Others came from somewhere else and went somewhere else."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Many were shape changing, transformed from or into human beings or natural species, or into natural features such as rocks but all left something of their spiritual essence at the places noted in their stories."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Australian Aboriginal mythologies have been characterized as "at one and the same time fragments of a [[catechism]], a [[Liturgy|liturgical]] manual, a history of [[civilization]], a [[geography]] textbook, and to a much smaller extent a manual of [[cosmography]]."&lt;ref&gt;Van Gennep, A. (1906)&lt;/ref&gt;


==Antiquity==
An Australian [[Linguistics|linguist]], [[R. M. W. Dixon]], recording Aboriginal myths in their original languages, encountered coincidences between some of the landscape details being told about within various myths, and [[Hard science|scientific]] discoveries being made about the same landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R. M. W. (1972) ''The Dyirbal Language of North Queensland''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Atherton Tableland]], myths tell of the origins of [[Lake Eacham]], [[Lake Barrine]], and [[Lake Euramo]]. Geological research dated the formative volcanic explosions described by Aboriginal myth tellers as having occurred more than 10,000 years ago. [[Paleobotany|Pollen fossil]] sampling from the silt which had settled to the bottom of the craters confirmed the Aboriginal myth-tellers' story. When the craters were formed, [[eucalyptus]] forests dominated rather than the current wet tropical [[rain forests]].&lt;ref name="Dixon, R. M. W. 1996"&gt;Dixon, R. M. W. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://earthsci.org/aboriginal/Ngadjonji%20History/antquity/history2.htm |title=Ngadjon jii - Earthwatch Web Page |access-date=25 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202233604/http://earthsci.org/aboriginal/Ngadjonji%20History/antquity/history2.htm |archive-date=2 February 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Lake Euramo]] for an excerpt of the original myth, translated.)

Dixon observed from the evidence available that Aboriginal myths regarding the origin of the Crater Lakes might be dated as accurate back to 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Dixon, R. M. W. 1996"/&gt; Further investigation of the material by the Australian Heritage Commission led to the Crater Lakes myth being listed nationally on the [[Register of the National Estate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AHD|105689|Queensland's wet tropical forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included within Australia's [[World Heritage]] nomination of the [[Wet Tropics of Queensland|wet tropical forests]], as an "unparalleled human record of events dating back to the [[Pleistocene]] era."&lt;ref&gt;cited in PANNELL, S (2006) ''Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage List''[http://www.rainforest-crc.jcu.edu.au/publications/nature_culture.htm Jcu.edu.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165537/http://www.rainforest-crc.jcu.edu.au/publications/nature_culture.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}. James Cook University, Cairns. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Dixon has assembled a number of similar examples of Australian Aboriginal myths that accurately describe landscapes of an ancient past. He particularly noted the numerous myths telling of previous sea levels, including:&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

*the [[Port Phillip]] myth (recorded as told to Robert Russell in 1850), describing Port Phillip Bay as once dry land, and the course of the [[Yarra River]] being once different, following what was then Carrum Carrum swamp.
*the [[Great Barrier Reef]] coastline myth (told to Dixon) in [[Yarrabah]], just south of [[Cairns]], telling of a past coastline (since flooded) which stood at the edge of the current Great Barrier Reef, and naming places now completely submerged after the forest types and trees that once grew there.
*the [[Lake Eyre]] myths (recorded by J. W. Gregory in 1906), telling of the deserts of [[Central Australia]] as once having been fertile, well-watered plains, and the deserts around present Lake Eyre having been one continuous garden. This oral story matches geologists' understanding that there was a wet phase to the early [[Holocene]] when the lake would have had permanent water.

Other volcanic eruptions in Australia may also be recorded in Aboriginal myths, including [[Mount Gambier, South Australia|Mount Gambier]] in South Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/when-the-bullin-shrieked-aboriginal-memories-of-volcanic-eruptions-thousands-of-years-ago-81986|title=When the Bullin shrieked: Aboriginal memories of volcanic eruptions thousands of years ago|last=Nunn|first=Patrick D.|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kinrara in northern Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-01|title=Holocene-Neogene volcanism in northeastern Australia: Chronology and eruption history|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871101416300826|journal=Quaternary Geochronology|language=en|volume=39|pages=79–91|doi=10.1016/j.quageo.2017.01.003|issn=1871-1014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity across a continent===
There are 900 distinct Aboriginal groups across Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Horton, David (1994) ''Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia''&lt;/ref&gt; each distinguished by unique names usually identifying particular [[language]]s, [[dialect]]s, or distinctive [[manner of articulation|speech mannerisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, T. J. (1994) "Tribal Names", in ed. David Horton (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Each language was used for original myths, from which the distinctive words and names of individual myths derive.

With so many distinct Aboriginal groups, languages, beliefs and practices, scholars cannot attempt to characterise, under a single heading, the full range and diversity of all myths being variously and continuously told, developed, elaborated, performed, and experienced by group members across the entire continent. (See external link&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbourne.indymedia.org/uploads/aus_map_covered_text_lined.jpg Indymedia.org]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024230333/http://www.melbourne.indymedia.org/uploads/aus_map_covered_text_lined.jpg |date=24 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for one indicative spatial map of Australian Aboriginal groups, and see [https://web.archive.org/web/20080316044231/http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/page/default.asp?site=2&amp;page=TIN_Tribal&amp;level=1 here] for an earlier [[Norman Tindale|Tindale]] map of Aboriginal groups.)

''The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia'' nevertheless observes: "One intriguing feature [of Aboriginal Australian mythology] is the mixture of diversity and similarity in myths across the entire continent."&lt;ref name="BERN001"/&gt;

===Public education about Aboriginal perspectives===
The [[Reconciliation Australia|Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation]]'s booklet, ''Understanding Country'', formally seeks to introduce non-indigenous Australians to Aboriginal perspectives on the environment. It makes the following generalisation about Aboriginal myths and mythology:&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Dermot (1994) ''Understanding Country: The Importance of Land and Sea in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Societies''. Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation's Key Issue Paper 1. Australian Government Publishing Service. Canberra. pp. 3, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...they generally describe the journeys of ancestral beings, often giant animals or people, over what began as a featureless domain. Mountains, rivers, waterholes, animal and plant species, and other natural and cultural resources came into being as a result of events which took place during these Dreamtime journeys. Their existence in present-day landscapes is seen by many indigenous peoples as confirmation of their creation beliefs..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The routes taken by the Creator Beings in their Dreamtime journeys across land and sea... link many [[Australian Aboriginal sacred sites|sacred sites]] together in a web of Dreamtime tracks criss-crossing the country. Dreaming tracks can run for hundreds, even thousands of kilometres, from desert to the coast [and] may be shared by peoples in countries through which the tracks pass..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An anthropological generalisation===
Australian [[anthropology|anthropologists]] willing to generalise suggest Aboriginal myths still being performed across Australia by Aboriginal peoples serve an important [[Functionalism (sociology)|social function]] amongst their intended audiences: justifying the received ordering of their daily lives;&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, J. (1994) pp.&amp;nbsp;97–115&lt;/ref&gt; helping shape peoples' ideas; and assisting to influence others' behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, M. (1994) "Storytelling" in Horton, David (1994) ''The Encyclopedia of Aboriginal Australia: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander History, Society, and Culture''  Aboriginal Studies Press. Canberra&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, such performance often continuously incorporates and "mythologises" historical events in the service of these social purposes in an otherwise rapidly changing [[modern world]]. As R.M. W. Dixon writes:&lt;ref&gt;[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R. M. W.]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is always integral and common... that the Law ([[Dreamtime#The Dreaming.2C Tribal Law .26 Songlines|Aboriginal law]]) is something derived from ancestral peoples or Dreamings and is passed down the generations in a continuous line. While... entitlements of particular human beings may come and go, the underlying relationships between foundational Dreamings and certain landscapes are theoretically eternal&amp;nbsp;... the entitlements of people to places are usually regarded strongest when those people enjoy a relationship of identity with one or more Dreamings of that place. This is an identity of spirit, a [[consubstantiality]], rather than a matter of mere belief...: the Dreaming pre-exists and persists, while its human incarnations are temporary."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Peter (2003) ''Native Title in Australia: An Ethnographic Perspective''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. pp. 113, 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An Aboriginal generalization===
Aboriginal specialists willing to generalise believe all Aboriginal myths across Australia, in combination, represent a kind of unwritten ([[Orality|oral]]) library within which Aboriginal peoples learn about the world and perceive a peculiarly Aboriginal 'reality' dictated by concepts and values vastly different from those of [[Western culture|western societies]]:&lt;ref&gt;Morris&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Aboriginal people learned from their stories that a society must not be human-centred but rather land centred, otherwise they forget their source and purpose&amp;nbsp;... humans are prone to exploitative behaviour if not constantly reminded they are interconnected with the rest of creation, that they as individuals are only temporal in time, and past and future generations must be included in their perception of their purpose in life."&lt;ref name="Morris C 1995 p 71"&gt;Morris, C (1995) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"People come and go but the Land, and stories about the Land, stay. This is a wisdom that takes lifetimes of listening, observing and experiencing&amp;nbsp;... There is a deep understanding of human nature and the environment... sites hold 'feelings' which cannot be described in physical terms... subtle feelings that resonate through the bodies of these people... It is only when talking and being with these people that these 'feelings' can truly be appreciated. This is... the intangible reality of these people..."&lt;ref name="Morris C 1995 p 71"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Pan-Australian mythology==

===Rainbow Serpent===
{{Main|Rainbow Serpent}}
[[Image:Australian-Carpet-Python.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Australian [[carpet python]], one of the forms the 'Rainbow Serpent' character may take in 'Rainbow Serpent' myths]]
In 1926 a British anthropologist specialising in Australian Aboriginal [[ethnology]] and [[ethnography]], Professor [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], noted many Aboriginal groups widely distributed across the Australian continent all appeared to share variations of a single (common) myth telling of an unusually powerful, often creative, often dangerous snake or serpent of sometimes enormous size closely associated with the rainbows, rain, rivers, and deep waterholes.&lt;ref name="RADC1926"&gt;Radcliffe-Brown, A. R. (1926) pp.&amp;nbsp;19–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Radcliffe-Brown coined the term 'Rainbow Serpent' to describe what he identified to be a common, recurring myth. Working in the field in various places on the Australian continent, he noted the key character of this myth (the 'Rainbow Serpent') is variously named:&lt;ref name="RADC1926"/&gt;

:''Kanmare'' ([[Boulia, Queensland]]); ''Tulloun'': ([[Mount Isa, Queensland]]); ''Andrenjinyi'' ([[Pennefather River]], Queensland), ''Takkan'' ([[Maryborough, Queensland]]); ''Targan'' ([[Brisbane]], Queensland); ''Kurreah'' ([[Broken Hill, New South Wales]]);''Wawi'' ([[Riverina]], New South Wales), ''Neitee &amp; Yeutta'' ([[Wilcannia, New South Wales]]), ''Myndie'' ([[Melbourne]], Victoria); ''Bunyip'' (Western [[Victoria (Australia)#Geology and geography|Victoria]]); ''[[The Arkaroo|Arkaroo]]'' (Flinders Ranges, South Australia); ''[[Wagyl|Wogal]]'' ([[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Western Australia); ''Wanamangura'' ([[Shire of Laverton|Laverton, Western Australia]]); ''Kajura'' ([[Shire of Carnarvon|Carnarvon, Western Australia]]); ''Numereji'' ([[Kakadu National Park|Kakadu, Northern Territory]]).

This 'Rainbow Serpent' is generally and variously identified by those who tell 'Rainbow Serpent' myths, as a snake of some enormous size often living within the deepest waterholes of many of Australia's waterways; descended from that larger being visible as a dark streak in the [[Milky Way]], it reveals itself to people in this world as a rainbow as it moves through water and rain, shaping landscapes, naming and singing of places, swallowing and sometimes drowning people; strengthening the knowledgeable with rainmaking and healing powers; blighting others with sores, weakness, illness, and death.&lt;ref name="RADC1926"/&gt;

Even Australia's '[[Bunyip]]' was identified as a 'Rainbow Serpent' myth of the above kind.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe-Brown (1926) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The term coined by Radcliffe-Brown is now commonly used and familiar to broader Australian and international audiences, as it is increasingly used by government agencies, museums, art galleries, Aboriginal organisations and the media to refer to the pan-Australian Aboriginal myth specifically, and as a shorthand allusion to Australian Aboriginal mythology generally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rainbow Serpent#External links]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captain Cook===
{{See also|James Cook}}
[[File:James Cook statue closeup 574.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Statue of Captain James Cook at [[Admiralty Arch]], London]]
A number of linguists, anthropologists and others have formally documented another common Aboriginal myth occurring across Australia. Predecessors of the myth tellers encounter a mythical, exotic (most often English) character who arrives from the sea, bringing western [[colonialism]], either offering gifts to the performer's predecessors or bringing great harm upon the performer's predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Maddock, K. (1988) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

This key mythical character is most often named 'Captain Cook', this being a 'mythical' character shared with the broader Australian community, who also attribute [[James Cook]] with playing a key role in colonising Australia.&lt;ref name="MADD001"&gt;Maddock (1988) p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginal 'Captain Cook' is attributed with bringing British rule to Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R. M. W. (1983) pp.&amp;nbsp;1–3&lt;/ref&gt; but his arrival is not celebrated. More often within the Aboriginal telling, he proves to be a [[villain]].&lt;ref name="MADD001"/&gt;

The many Aboriginal versions of this 'Captain Cook' are rarely oral recollections of encounters with the [[Lieutenant]] [[James Cook]] who first navigated and mapped Australia's east coast on the [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] in 1770. [[Guugu Yimithirr people|Guugu Yimidhirr]] predecessors, along the [[Endeavour River]], did encounter James Cook during a 7-week period beached at the site of the present town of [[Cooktown]] while the Endeavour was being repaired.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, Richard. (1994). ''Captain James Cook: a biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–155. Hodder and Stoughton, London. {{ISBN|0-340-58598-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this time the Guugu Yimidhirr did receive present-day names for places occurring in their local landscape; and the Guugu Yimmidhir may recollect this encounter.

The pan-Australian Captain Cook myth, however, tells of a generic, largely symbolic British character who arrives from across the oceans sometime after the Aboriginal world was formed and the original social order founded. This Captain Cook is a harbinger of dramatic transformations in the social order, bringing change and a different social order, into which present-day audiences have been born.&lt;ref&gt;Maddock, K. (1988) p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Australian Aboriginal mythology#An Anthropological generalisation|above]] regarding this social function played by Aboriginal myths)

In 1988 Australian anthropologist [[Kenneth Maddock]] assembled several versions of this 'Captain Cook' myth as recorded from a number of Aboriginal groups around Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Maddock, K. (1988) pp.&amp;nbsp;13–19&lt;/ref&gt; Included in his assemblage are:
*'''[[Batemans Bay, New South Wales]]:''' Percy Mumbulla told of Captain Cook's arriving on a large ship which anchored at [[Snapper Island (New South Wales)|Snapper Island]], from which he disembarked to give the myth-teller's predecessors clothes (to wear) and hard biscuits (to eat). Then he returned to his ship and sailed away. Mumbulla told how his predecessors rejected Captain Cook's gifts, throwing them into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Roland (1970) ''Alteringa and Other Aboriginal Poems''. A. H. and A. W. Reed.

*'''[[Cardwell, Queensland]]:''' Chloe Grant and Rosie Runaway told of how Captain Cook and his group seemed to stand up out of the sea with the white skin of ancestral spirits, returning to their descendants. Captain Cook arrived first offering a pipe and [[tobacco]] to smoke (which was dismissed as a 'burning thing... stuck in his mouth'), then boiling a billy of [[tea]] (which was dismissed as [[scalding]] 'dirty water'), next baking [[flour]] on the coals (which was rejected as smelling 'stale' and thrown away untasted), finally boiling [[beef]] (which smelled well, and tasted okay, once the salty skin was wiped off). Captain Cook and group then left, sailing away to the north, leaving Chloe Grant and Rosie Runaway's predecessors beating the ground with their fists, fearfully sorry to see the spirits of their ancestors depart in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''South-eastern side of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], [[Queensland]]:''' Rolly Gilbert told of how Captain Cook and others sailed the oceans in a boat, and decided to come to see Australia. There he encountered a couple of Rolly's predecessors whom he first intended to shoot, but instead tricked them into revealing the local population's main camping area, after which they:&lt;ref&gt;Maddock, K. (1988) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"set up the people [cattle industry] to go down the countryside and shoot people down, just like animal, they left them lying there for the hawks and crows... So a lot of old people and young people were struck by the head with the end of a gun and left there. They wanted to get the people wiped out because Europeans in Queensland had to run their stock: horses and cattle."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''[[Victoria River (Northern Territory)]]:''' it is told in a Captain Cook [[saga]] that Captain Cook sailed from London to [[Sydney]] to acquire land. Admiring the country, he landed [[Cattle|bullocks]] and men with [[firearms]], following which local Aboriginal peoples in the Sydney area were [[List of events named massacres|massacred]]. Captain Cook made his way to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], where he sent armed horsemen to hunt down the Aborigines in the Victoria River country, founding the city of Darwin and giving police plus cattle station managers orders on how to treat Aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Deborah (1984) "The Saga of Captain Cook: Morality in Aboriginal and European Law", ''Australian Aboriginal Studies'' Volume 2; pp.&amp;nbsp;24–39&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' [[Kimberley (Western Australia)]]:''' Numerous Aboriginal myth-tellers say that Captain Cook is a European culture hero who landed in Australia. Using gunpowder, he set a precedent for the treatment of Aboriginal peoples throughout Australia, including the Kimberley. On returning to his home, he claimed he had not seen any Aboriginal peoples, and advised that the country was a vast and empty land which settlers could come and claim for themselves. In this myth, Captain Cook introduced 'Cook's Law', upon which the settlers rely. The Aboriginals note, however, that this is a recent, unjust and false law compared to Aboriginal law.&lt;ref&gt;Kolig, Erich (1980) "Captain Cook in the Kimberley's", in Berndt, R. M. &amp; Berndt, C. H. (Eds) ''Aborigines of the West: Their Past and Their Present''. University of Western Australia Press. St Lucia. pp.&amp;nbsp;23–27&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on death ===
Death in Aboriginal religion in some aspects may seem like it has some Western traditions in regard to having a ceremony and mourning the loss of the person that is deceased. However, that is really the only thing that this religion has in common with Western religion as far as death is concerned. "For Aboriginal people when a person dies some form of the persons spirit and also their bones go back to the country they were born in".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experiences of Place (Religions of the World)|last=Bird Rose|first=Deborah|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0945454380|location=|pages=163–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Aborigine people believe that they share their being with their country and all that is within it". "So when a person dies their country suffers, trees die and become scarred because it is believed that came into being because of the deceased person".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When an Aborigine person dies the families have death ceremonies called the "Sorry Business". "During this time the entire community and family mourns the loss of the person for days". "They are expected to cry together and share grief as a community".  If someone was out of town and arrives after they have had a ceremony for the deceased, the entire community stops what they are doing and  goes and tells them and mourns with them. "The family of the deceased all stay in one room and mourn for their loved one".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/people/mourning-an-aboriginal-death#ixzz4g5QXFnLX|title=Mourning an Aboriginal death|last=Spirits|first=Jens Korff, Creative|website=Creative Spirits|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Naming a person after they have died is not allowed in the Aborigine religion". "To say someone's name after they die would be to disturb their spirit ".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Photos of the deceased are not allowed for fear of disturbing the spirit also. Many Aborigine families will not have any photographs of their loved ones after they die. "A smoking ceremony is also conducted when someone dies". "The community uses smoke on the  belongings and also the residence of the deceased to help release the spirit". "Identifying the cause of death is determined by elders who hold the cultural authority to do so, and the causes in question are usually of a spiritual nature". "The ceremonies are likened to an autopsy of Western practice".

Ceremonies and mourning periods last days, weeks and even sometimes months depending upon the social status of the deceased person.  It is culturally inappropriate for a non-Aboriginal person to contact and inform the next of kin of a person’s passing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When someone passes away, the family of the deceased move out of their house and another family then moves in. Some families will move to "sorry camps" which are usually further away.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  
Mourning includes the recital of symbolic chants, the singing of songs, dance, body paint, and cuts on the bodies of the mourners. The body is placed on a raised platform  for several months, covered in native plants. Sometimes a cave or a tree is used instead. "When nothing but bones are left, family and friends will scatter them in a variety of ways. They sometimes wrap the bones in a hand-knitted fabric and place them in a cave for eventual disintegration or place them in a naturally hollowed out log".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Aboriginals believe in a place called the "Land of the Dead". This place was also commonly known as the  "sky-world", which is really just the sky. As long as certain rituals were carried out during their life and at the time of their death, the deceased is allowed to enter The Land of the Dead in the "Sky World".  The spirit of the dead is also a part of different lands and sites and then those areas become [[Australian Aboriginal sacred sites|sacred site]]s. This explains why the Aboriginals are very protective of sites they call sacred. The Aboriginals believe that life is a never-ending cycle. You are born, you die, you are born again as an animal, human or other life form .

The rituals that are performed enable the aborigine to return to the womb of all time which is another word for "Dream Time". It allows the spirit to be  connected once more to all nature, to all their ancestors, and to their own personal meaning and place within the scheme of things. "The Dreamtime is a return to the real existence for the aborigine". "Life in time is simply a passing phase – a gap in eternity". It has a beginning and it has an end. "The experience of Dreamtime, whether through ritual or from dreams, flowed through into the life in time in practical ways". "The individual who enters the Dreamtime feels no separation between themselves and their ancestors". "The strengths and resources of the timeless enter into what is needed in the life of the present". "The future is less uncertain because the individual feels their life as a continuum linking past and future in unbroken connection". Through Dreamtime the limitations of time and space are overcome.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/australian-aborigine-dream-beliefs/|title=Australian Aborigine Dream Beliefs|work=dreamhawk.com|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For the Aborigine people dead relatives are very much a part of continuing life. It is believed that in dreams dead relatives communicate their presence." At times they may bring healing if the dreamer is in pain". "Death is seen as part of a cycle of life in which one emerges from Dreamtime through birth, and eventually returns to the timeless, only to emerge again. It is also a common belief that a person leaves their body during sleep, and temporarily enters the Dreamtime".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Murrinh-Patha people's country&lt;ref name="deBr001" /&gt;
|}
The [[Murrinh-Patha]] people (whose country is the saltwater country immediately inland from the town of [[Wadeye, Northern Territory|Wadeye]]&lt;ref name="deBr001"&gt;de Brabander, Dallas (1994) "Murrinh-patha" in Horton, David  (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;) describe a [[Dreamtime]] in their myths which anthropologists believe is a religious belief equivalent to, though wholly different from, most of the world's other significant religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="YENG001"&gt;Yengoyan (1979)citing Stanner (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, scholars suggest the Murrinh-Patha have a oneness of thought, belief, and expression unequalled within [[Christianity]], as they see all aspects of their lives, thoughts and culture as under the continuing influence of their Dreaming.&lt;ref name="YENG001"/&gt; Within this Aboriginal religion, no distinction is drawn between things spiritual/ideal/mental and things material; nor is any distinction drawn between things sacred and things profane: rather all life is 'sacred', all conduct has 'moral' implication, and all life's meaning arises out of this eternal, everpresent [[Dreaming (story)|Dreaming]].&lt;ref name="YENG001"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In fact, the isomorphic fit between the natural and supernatural means that all nature is coded and charged by the [[sacred]], while the sacred is everywhere within the physical landscape. Myths and mythic tracks cross over.. thousands of miles, and every particular form and feature of the terrain has a well-developed 'story' behind it."&lt;ref&gt;Yengoyan (1979) p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Animating and sustaining this Murrinh-patha mythology is an underlying philosophy of life that has been characterised by [[Bill Stanner|Stanner]] as a belief that life is "...&amp;nbsp;a joyous thing with [[maggots]] at its centre.".&lt;ref name="YENG001"/&gt; Life is good and benevolent, but throughout life's journey, there are numerous painful sufferings that each individual must come to understand and endure as he grows. This is the underlying message repeatedly being told within the Murrinh-patha myths. It is this philosophy that gives Murrinh-patha people motive and meaning in life.&lt;ref name="YENG001"/&gt;

The following Murrinh-patha myth, for instance, is performed in Murrinh-patha ceremonies to initiate young men into adulthood.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A woman, ''Mutjinga'' (the 'Old Woman'), was in charge of young children, but instead of watching out for them during their parents' absence, she swallowed them and tried to escape as a giant snake. The people followed her, spearing her and removing the undigested children from the body."&lt;ref&gt;Stanner, W. E. H. (1966) pp.&amp;nbsp;40–43, as summarised and cited by Koepping, Klaus-Peter (1981) p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within the myth and in its performance, young, unadorned children must first be swallowed by an ancestral being (who transforms into a [[#Rainbow Serpent|giant snake]]), then regurgitated before being accepted as young adults with all the rights and privileges of young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Koepping, Klaus-Peter (1981) pp.&amp;nbsp;377–378&lt;/ref&gt;

Pintupi people's country

Scholars of the [[Pintupi]] peoples (from within Australia's [[Gibson Desert]] region) believe they have a predominantly 'mythic' form of [[consciousness]],&lt;ref&gt;Rumsey, Allen (1994) pp.&amp;nbsp;116–128&lt;/ref&gt; within which events occur and are explained by the preordained social structures and orders told of, sung about, and performed within their superhuman mythology, rather than by reference to the possible accumulated political actions, decisions and influences of local individuals (i.e. this understanding effectively 'erases' history).&lt;ref&gt;Myers, E. (1986) ''Pintupi Country, Pintubi Self: Sentiment, Place and Politics among Western Desert Aborigines''. Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra &amp; Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Dreaming.. provides a [[moral authority]] lying outside the individual will and outside human creation.. although the Dreaming as an ordering of the cosmos is presumably a product of historical events, such an origin is denied."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"These human creations are objectified &amp;ndash; thrust out &amp;ndash; into principles or precedents for the immediate world.. Consequently, current action is not understood as the result of human alliances, creations, and choices, but is seen as imposed by an embracing, cosmic order."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within this Pintupi [[world view]], three long geographical tracks of named places dominate, being interrelated strings of significant places named and created by mythic characters on their routes through the Pintupi desert region during the Dreaming. It is a complex mythology of narratives, songs and ceremonies known to the Pintupi as [[Tingari|''Tingarri'']]. It is most completely told and performed by Pintupi peoples at larger gatherings within Pintupi country.&lt;ref&gt;De Brabander, Dallas (1984) "Pintupi", in Horton, David (General Editor)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days==
In 1953 the twelve existing [[National Spiritual Assembly|Bahá'í National Spiritual Assemblies]] were asked by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, to help spread the religion. The community of the United States was to attempt to bring the religion to Tonga.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt; In Tonga, the Bahá'í community grew much like it did in other Pacific communities &amp;mdash; first the community emerged through the acts of both pioneers and converts and then grew by spreading through family and tribal groups or clan-structures.&lt;ref name="hassal-pacific"/&gt;

Australian Stanley P. Bolton was the first Bahá'í to arrive in Tonga &amp;mdash; he arrived on 25 January 1954.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; American Dudley M. Blakely, nephew of [[Lua Getsinger]], and wife Elsa also pioneered to Tonga on 12 July 1954. Each earned the title [[Knights of Bahá'u'lláh]] for their service to the religion. Blakely was a designer and worked as an adviser to the Tongan government contributing to a number of buildings and furnishings as well as stamps and coins for the government. In 1961 he had designed a five-stamp special issue set commemorating mail deliveries to the islands changing from the era of the fishing boat to [[airmail]]. In 1962 he designed a set of the first gold coins in [[Polynesia]]. He designed Tonga's first decimal coin set in 1965.&lt;ref name="blakely"&gt;{{Citation | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 686–7, 757, 793–4, 809–11 | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/666-693.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1956 there were indigenous Bahá'í converts on the islands;&lt;ref name="blakely"/&gt; three individuals who converted to the religion were prominent in Tongan society: Mosese Hokafonu, Lisiata Mak, and Suliana Halaholo. Mosese Hokafonu, who lived on the island of [[Tongatapu]], converted to the Bahá'í Faith in the early 1950s. For many years Hokafonu served on the Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of [[Nuku'alofa]] and donated a significant portion of the land for the site of the national Bahá'í Center. Hokafonu joined Gina and [[Russell Garcia (composer)|Russell Garcia]] on board their boat ''the Dawnbreaker'' for an extensive trip which took them through the islands of [[Fiji]], Tonga and [[Samoa]]. Hokafonu was the first Pacific Islander to undertake missionary trips of long duration &amp;mdash; including [[Kiribati]] and Tuvalu; Niue; the Solomon Islands; New Guinea; the Marshall, Mariana and Caroline Islands; Nauru; Australia and New Zealand (especially among the [[Māori people|Māori]]), Hawaii, Alaska and the continental United States. [[Baron Vaea of Houma|Baron Vaea]], a Tongan noble and former Prime Minister, a relative of Hokafonu, conducted the funeral service which was attended by many hundreds of people.&lt;ref name="blakely"/&gt;

Lisiata Maka, a legal adviser in Tonga's lower and supreme courts, became a Bahá'í in 1957 and was elected to the Regional National Assembly, and was later appointed to the [[Institution of the Counsellors|Continental Board of Counsellors]].&lt;ref name="hassal-pacific"/&gt; Suliana Halaholo was born in Tonga in 1950 and began attending a [[Bahá'í school|Bahá'í school's]] children's classes at the age of eight. Soon she was teaching classes and began being involved in administrative activities while she was still a youth. She was secretary of the youth committee of Tonga, and later of Fiji, and thanks to her academic achievements the government of Tonga gave her a scholarship to study [[dietetics]] at the [[University of the South Pacific]] in [[Suva]], Fiji, where she obtained her bachelor's degree. Halalholo devoted two of her vacations from schooling to translating into the Tongan language ''[[The Seven Valleys]]'' (one of Bahá'u'lláh's metaphysical works), and later the Tablet [[Words of Wisdom]]. Both translations were approved by the National Spiritual Assembly of Tonga.&lt;ref name="blakely"/&gt;

==Growth==
The first Local Spiritual Assembly of Tonga was of Nuku'alofa in 1958,&lt;ref name="hassal-pacific"/&gt; and by 1963 there were Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies in [[Houma (Tongatapu)|Houma]], [[Kolonga]], [[Mu'a (Tongatapu)|Mu'a]], Nuku'alofa, [[Vaini]], and smaller Bahá'í groups in [[Folaha]], [[Tokomolo]], [[Vaotu'u]] and isolated Bahá'ís in [[Felemea]] and several villages on the island of [[Haʻapai]] - [[Kotu']], [[Lotofoa]], [[Na'ufanga]], [[Nomuka]] and [[Ohonua Eua]].&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

Tonga developed international administrative relationships in tandem with its internal growth. Mr. Latu Tu 'Akihekolo represented Tongan Bahá'ís to an Bahá'í International Conference in Japan in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Bahá'í pioneers continued to make their presence felt in Tonga whether their stay was short or long. Margaret Rowling was almost constantly traveling to Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, New Caledonia, Nouméa and the Cook Islands between 1956 and 1975.&lt;ref name="blakely"/&gt; During 1974-79 Australian pioneers embarked to many of the Pacific islands including Tonga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2004, during the golden jubilee of the Bahá'í community of Tonga, there were 29 local spiritual assemblies and the community has had visits over the years from prominent Baha'is &amp;mdash; [[Hands of the Cause]] [[Collis Featherstone]], [[Abu'l-Qasim Faizi]], [[Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir]], [[Enoch Olinga]], [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]], and [[John Robarts (Bahá'í)|John Robarts]], and a member of the Universal House of Justice, [[Hugh Chance]].&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt;

Celebrations held for the golden anniversary of the Bahá'í Faith in Tonga included the attendance of then Crown Prince [[George Tupou V|Tupouto'a]], Native American artist [[Kevin Locke (musician)|Kevin Locke]] as well as choirs, dance troops, tribal story tellers and hundreds of participants.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; The brother of then Crown Prince Topouto'a, the Honoroble Ma'atu, died on 17 February 2004 after suffering a heart attack. Representatives of the Bahá'í community accepted an invitation to offer prayers at the memorial service held on 24 February&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; and was survived by his wife Alaileula, the granddaughter of the late [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]], former Head of State of [[Samoa]], also a member of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Opposition in Tonga===
While the Bahá'í community has grown in the country, there has also been opposition. In 1973, the Wesleyan Church of Niua Toputapu published an anti-Bahá'í polemic "The Baha'i Faith Answered by Christianity".&lt;ref name="MacEoin"&gt;{{cite web | last = MacEoin | first = Denis |author2=William Collins | title = Anti-Baha'i Polemics | work = The Babi and Baha'i Religions: An Annotated Bibliography | publisher = Greenwood Press's ongoing series of Bibliographies and Indexes in Religious Studies | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/antibahai.polemic.html | accessdate = 2008-04-12|at  = entry #773 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515215132/http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/antibahai.polemic.html| archivedate= 15 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, even as late as 2008 the [[Tonga Broadcasting Commission]] (TBC) maintains policy guidelines regarding the broadcast of religious programming on [[Radio Tonga]]. The TBC guidelines state that in view of "the character of the listening public" those who preach on Radio Tonga must confine their preaching "within the limits of the mainstream Christian tradition." Due to this policy, the TBC does not allow discussions by members of the Bahá'í Faith of its founder, [[Bahá'u'lláh]], by name, or of the tenets of their religions. Members of the Bahá'í Faith utilize a privately owned radio station for program activities and the announcement of functions.&lt;ref name="statedept"/&gt;

==Demographics==
In 1983, Bahá'í sources claimed they constituted 3.9% of the national population and by 1987 the number of Bahá'ís was at 6.3%.&lt;ref name="hassal-pacific"/&gt; Through 2000-2006 estimates ranged between nearly 5%&lt;ref name="statedept"/&gt; or 6.09%.&lt;ref&gt;Sources: Year 2000 Estimated Baha'i statistics from: David Barrett, [[World Christian Encyclopedia]], 2000; Total population statistics, mid-2000 from Population Reference Bureau [http://www.prb.org] and ''The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Encyclopedia Encarta]] estimated the Bahá'í community constituted 7% of the national population, (about 8100 individuals) &amp;mdash; more than twice the size of the remaining non-Christian religious groups in Tonga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Bahá'í community in Tonga has organized various institutions and events in the country. The [[Ocean of Light International School]] is a private [[International school|internationalist]] [[Bahá'í school]] directly administered by a non-profit Board of Education nominated by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Tonga. The school is known as a Bahá'í school and is striving to incorporate [[Bahá'í teachings|Bahá'í ideals]], principles and concepts into the curriculum and organization of the school. The school is located in Kolomotu’a / Hofoa - about 3 kilometers from the centre of [[Nukuʻalofa|Nuku{{Okina}}alofa]]. It offers classes from kindergarten (3 years old) to high school diploma using [[Cambridge International Examinations]] including the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education]]. There are Bahá'í youth performing periods of service at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In [[Islam]], '''bid‘ah''' ({{lang-ar|بدعة}}; {{lang-en|innovation}}) refers to innovation in religious matters.&lt;ref name="jacb1"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = A.C. Brown|first1 = Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan A.C. Brown|title = Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World ''(Foundations of Islam)''|date = 2009|publisher = [[Oneworld Publications]]|isbn = 978-1851686636|page = 277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically the term means "innovation, novelty, heretical doctrine, [[heresy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Hans|title=Arabic-English Dictionary|year=1994|publisher=Spoken Language Services, Inc.|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical Arabic literature ([[Adab (literature)|adab]]), it has been used as a form of praise for outstanding compositions of prose and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Shatibi|first=Ibrahim ibn Musa|title=''al-I`itsam''|pages=1:49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Sunni Islam==
In early Islamic history, bid'ah referred primarily to heterodox doctrines (as evidenced below). However, in Islamic law, when used without qualification, bid'ah denotes any newly invented matter that is without precedent and is in opposition to the [[Quran]] and [[Sunnah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Masri|first=Jamaluddin ibn al-Manzur|title=Lisan al-‘Arab|pages=8:6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars (most prominent of which is [[Al-Shafi‘i|Imam Shafi‘i]]) generally have divided bid'ah into two types: innovations in worldly matters and innovations in religious matters.&lt;ref name=IS&gt;''Al-Qawaa'id wal-Usool al-Jaami'ah wal-Furooq wat-Taqaaseem al-Badee'ah an-Naafi'ah'' by [[Abd ar-Rahman as-Saa'di|Abd ar-Rahman ibn Naasir as-Sa'di]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}{{qn|date=April 2016}} Some have additionally divided bid'ah into lawful and unlawful innovations, the details of which are discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nawawi|first=Al-|title=Tahzeeb al-Asma wal-Lugha|volume=2|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introducing and acting upon a bid‘ah in religious matters is a sin and considered one of the [[Islamic views on sin#Islamic Major sins: Al-Kaba.27ir|enormities]] in Islam that is obligatory to immediately desist and repent from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Dhahabi|first=Muhammad ibn Ahmad|title=Kitab al-Kaba'ir}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

===In worldly matters===
[[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslim scholars have divided bid‘ah in worldly matters into two types:&lt;ref name=IS/&gt;
# Good innovations such as using technology to propagate the faith of Islam.&lt;ref name=bahith-Q-A&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Bahith ,|first1=Yahya|title=What is the meaning of Bida’a?

Using modern technology in Dawah is required as means to convoy the message of Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Innovations that are purely evil - these are forbidden under Islamic law. Examples of this type of bid'ah include alcohol,&lt;ref&gt;Fat-hul Baari by [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] (vol.2, page 443)&lt;/ref&gt; or, in modern times, the discovery and synthesis of new intoxicants.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===In religious matters===

====Traditional view====
There are a number of different definitions of Bid‘ah.
* Good and bad innovation: 
** ''Bid'ah Say'iah'', "a new thing" which "opposes the Quran and Sunnah" or is "against Islam"&lt;ref name=Alahazrat.net-bidah/&gt; ([[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]]&lt;ref&gt;(Fathul Bari chap on Taravi by Hafidhh Asqalani)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]])&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya wrote: 'The one who denies the punishment of the grave is an innovater'.&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Sharia]] (Islamic law)" (Muhammad Ramzaan),&lt;ref name=Haajiree-8&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bin Ramzaan Al Haajiree|first1=Muhammad|title=The Guidance of the Companions With Regards To The People Of Innovation (Salafi)|date=2013|publisher=MPUBS|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9QC-AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=examples+of+bid%27ah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAmoVChMIscCS6_faxwIVDQeSCh0hngKa#v=onepage&amp;q=examples%20of%20bid%27ah&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or removes sunnah or wajib and is forbidden.
** ''Bid'ah Hasana'', a new thing that is not against the Sharia (according to scholars such as [[Muhammad ash-Shawkani]]&lt;ref&gt;Qadi Shawkani ''Nayl-ul-Autaar'', chapter Salaah Al Taravee&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Nawawi]]&lt;ref&gt;Tahzeeb al-Asma wal-Lughat, word Bid’ah by Imam Nawawi&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani,&lt;ref&gt;(Hafidhh Asqalani, ''Fathul Bari'', chapter on Taravi)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Manzur]], [[Al-Raghib al-Isfahani]] and [[Badr al-Din al-Ayni]]).&lt;ref name=Alahazrat.net-bidah/&gt; An example of ''Bid'ah Hasana'' is the development of the study of [[Hadith]], [[Fiqh]], [[Tafsir]], which did not exist at the time of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (Al-Nawawi).&lt;ref&gt;Tahzeeb al Asma wal lughaat word Bid’ah by Imam Nawawi&lt;/ref&gt;
* "carrying out actions which displease Allah ta'ala and his messenger" Muhammad. ([[Muhammad ibn Isa at-Tirmidhi]]).&lt;ref name=Alahazrat.net-bidah&gt;from: {{cite web|title=Concept of Bidah in Islam|url=http://www.alahazrat.net/islam/concept-of-bidah-in-islam.php|website=Alahazrat.net|publisher=INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC WEBSITE|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Tirmizi chapter Il&lt;/ref&gt;
* "new things that have no basis in the Qur'an or Sunnah" ([[Ibn Rajab]]).&lt;ref name=Alahazrat.net-bidah/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Hafidhh ibn Rajjab, ''Jaami' Al Uloom Al Hukkam'', p 252)&lt;/ref&gt;
* bid'ah is always bad but if a new thing has origins in the Qur'an and Sunnah it is to be called ''Bid'ah Logaviyya'' (verbal innovation), ([[Ibn Taymiyyah]]).&lt;ref name=Alahazrat.net-bidah/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Hafidhh ibn Taymiyya, ''Iqtidah al Sirat al Mustaqeem''. chapter on Bid'ah)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views against bid’ah====
The Qur'anic verse: "This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion."({{cite quran|5|4|s=ns}}), is considered by at least some Muslim to be against bid'ah in religion. The [[Sunnah]] has many more prohibitions against innovation in religion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Talib]], of the ''[[Rashidun]]'' (rightly guided [[Caliph]]s),  said; "He who innovates or gives protection to an innovator, there is a curse of [[Allah]] and that of His [[angel]]s and that of the whole humanity upon him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|9|3601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|80|8747}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] said: "Every innovation is misguidance, even if the people see it as something good."&lt;ref&gt;Abu Shaamah (no. 39)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]], a companion of the Prophet and early Islamic scholar also said: "Indeed the most detestable of things to Allah are the innovations."&lt;ref&gt;al-Bayhaqee in as-Sunan al-Kubraa (4/316)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufyan al-Thawri]], a ''[[taba'een|tabi'i]]'' [[Islamic scholar]], [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Hafiz]] and [[jurist]],  mentions: "Innovation is more beloved to [[Devil (Islam)|Iblees]] than sin, since a sin may be [[Repentance in Islam|repented]] for but innovation is not repented for."&lt;ref&gt;al-Laalikaa'ee - Sharh Usool I'tiqaad [[Salafi|Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah]] (no. 238)&lt;/ref&gt; He also said, "Whoever listens to an innovator has left the protection of Allāh and is entrusted with the innovation."&lt;ref&gt;Abu Nu'aym in al-Hilyah (7/26) and Ibn Battah (no.444)&lt;/ref&gt;

A person once sent salaam to [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] who replied: "I do not accept his salaam, as this person has innovated by becoming [[Qadariyah]] (A sect which does not believe in destiny.")&lt;ref&gt;''Kitaab-ul-Iman wa-al-Qadr'', transmitted by Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Fuḍayl ibn ‘Iyāḍ]] is reputed to have said: "I met the best of people, all of them Salafi and they used to forbid from accompanying the people of innovation."&lt;ref name=WAISP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abu 'Iyaad as-Salafi|title=Warning Against the Innovators|url=http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=BDH05&amp;articleID=BDH050003&amp;articlePages=1|website=salafi publications|accessdate=26 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626102140/http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=BDH05&amp;articleID=BDH050003&amp;articlePages=1|archivedate=26 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;al-Laalikaa'ee - Sharh Usool I'tiqaad [[Salafi|Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah]] (no.267)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hasan al-Basri]] mentions: "Do not sit with the people of innovation and desires, nor argue with them, nor listen to them".&lt;ref&gt;Sunan ad-Daarimee (1/121)&lt;/ref&gt; Ibraaheem ibn Maysarah mentions: "Whoever honours an innovator has aided in the destruction of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;al-Laalikaa'ee - Sharh Usool I'tiqaad [[Salafi|Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah]] (1/139)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Barbahari]] mentions: "The innovators are like [[scorpion]]s. They bury their heads and bodies in the sand and leave their tails out. When they get the chance they sting; the same with the innovators who conceal themselves amongst the people, when they are able, they do what they desire."&lt;ref&gt;Tabaqaatul-Hanaabilah - Volume 2, Page 44&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Haatim said: "A sign of the people of innovation is their battling against the people of Narrations."&lt;ref&gt;Sharh Usool I'tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah - al-Laalikaa'ee - Volume 1, Page 179&lt;/ref&gt; Abu 'Uthmaan as-Saaboonee said: "The signs of the people of innovation are clear and obvious. The most apparent of their signs is their severe enmity for those who carry the reports of the Prophet."&lt;ref&gt;Abu 'Uthmaan as-Saaboonee, The 'Aqeedah of the [[Salaf|(Pious) Predecessors]] - Page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

A tradition holds that Muhammad told a companion: "The person who introduced a good (precedent) thing in Islam, shall obtain the reward for it and also the reward for those who adopt it. As for the one who introduces a bad thing he will obtain the punishment for introducing it and also for those who adopt it, will also be punished."&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim, Kitaab-uz-Zakaat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tirmidhi, chapter 11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6mKCwAAQBAJ|title=Force and Fanaticism: Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia and Beyond|last=Valentine|first=Simon Ross|date=2015-08-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849046152|page=88|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s6sYxzbiP-gC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=bid%2527a+hasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=bid'a%2520hasana&amp;f=false|title=Muslim Studies, Vol. 1|last=Goldziher|first=Ignác|date=1973-01-01|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780873952347|page=37|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jabir ibn Abd Allah]] narrated "...The Prophet said: He who introduced some good (precedent) practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect.

[[Anas ibn Malik]] said "I heard the Prophet say: 'My nation will not unite on misguidance, so if you see them differing, follow the great majority.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunan ibn Majah]] [http://sunnah.com/ibnmajah/36 5:36:3950]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abu Hurairah]] narrated that the Prophet said, "Whoever prayed at night the whole month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven." After the Prophet's death the people continued observing that (i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it remained as it was during the Caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]] and in the early days of [[Umar|Umar ibn Al-Khattab]]'s Caliphate. During [[Ramadan]] upon seeing people praying in different groups, Umar ordered [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]] to lead the people in congregational prayer. On this Umar said: 'What an excellent Bida (i.e. innovation in religion at that time from an earlier time) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari]], {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|3|32|227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s6sYxzbiP-gC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=good+and+bad+innovation+Shafi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=good%2520and%2520bad%2520innovation%2520Shafi&amp;f=false|title=Muslim Studies, Vol. 1|last=Goldziher|first=Ignác|date=1973-01-01|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780873952347|page=36|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PzVCgAAQBAJ|title=Shari'a and Muslim Minorities: The wasati and salafi approaches to fiqh al-aqalliyyat al-Muslima|last=Shavit|first=Uriya|date=2015-11-12|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191074448|language=en|quote=It was accorded a second, positive connotation by the second Khalifa Umar, who said in regard to the prayer of Ramadan that it is a blessed innovation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salman the Persian|Salman al-Farsi]] narrated that the Prophet was asked, by some of the companions, about the permissibility and prohibition of certain items, he states "Halal is that which Allah has made Halal in His book, Haram is that which Allah has made Haram in His book and about which he has remained silent is all forgiven."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Majah, page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Hurairah narrated at the time of the [[Fajr prayer]] the Prophet asked [[Bilal ibn al-Harith]], "Tell me of the best deed you did after embracing Islam, for I heard your footsteps in front of me in Paradise." Bilal replied, "I did not do anything worth mentioning except that whenever I performed ablution during the day or night, I prayed after that ablution as much as was written for me."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari]], {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|2|21|250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani says in ''[[Fath al-Bari]]'' that "the hadith shows it is permissible to use personal reasoning (ijtihad) in choosing times for acts of worship, for Bilal reached the conclusion he mentioned by his own inference and the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) confirmed him therein."&lt;ref name="The Concept of Bid‘a in the Islamic Shari‘a2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Keller|first=Nuh Ha Mim|title=The Concept of Bid‘a in the Islamic Shari‘a|url=http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/bida.htm|year=1995|publisher=Muslim Academy Trust]|pages=5|isbn=1-902350-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to this, [[Khubyab bin Adi]] asked to pray two rak‘as before being executed by idolators in Mecca, and was hence the first to establish the ''sunna'' of two rak'as for those who are steadfast in going to their death.&lt;ref name="The Concept of Bid‘a in the Islamic Shari‘a2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari]], {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|4|52|281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rifaa ibn Rafi narrated: When we were praying behind the Prophet and he raised his head from bowing and said, "Allah hears whoever praises Him," a man behind him said, "Our Lord, Yours is the praise, abundandly, wholesomely, and blessedly."When he rose to leave, the Prophet asked who said it, and when the man replied that it was he, the Prophet said, "I saw thirty-odd angel each striving to be the one to write it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari]], {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|1|12|764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani comments in ''Fath al-Bari'' that the hadith "indicates the permissibility of initiation new expression of ''dhikr'' in the prayer other than the ones related through hadith texts (even though this is still reported in the hadiths), as long as they do not contradict those conveyed by the hadith. It is clear that this is since the above were a mere enhancement and addendum to the know, ''sunna dhikr''."&lt;ref name="The Concept of Bid‘a in the Islamic Shari‘a2"/&gt;

[[Imam Shafi'i]] gave the following advice, "An innovation which contradicts the Qur'an, Sunnah, an Athar or [[Ijma]] is a heretical bid'a: if however something new is introduced which is not evil in itself and does not contradict the above mentioned authorities of religious life, then it is a praiseworthy, unobjectional bid'a." This can infer worldly bid'a or technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;al-Bayhaqi, Manaqib al-Shafi'i, in Qastallani, X, p 342.

====Modern discourse====
The criterion that qualifies a particular action as a bid'ah in the religion is a debate amongst Sunni scholars. Scholars affiliated to the [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] and [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] sects argue for an exclusive, literal definition that entails anything not specifically performed or confirmed by the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6mKCwAAQBAJ|title=Force and Fanaticism: Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia and Beyond|last=Valentine|first=Simon Ross|date=2015-08-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849046152|page=87|language=en|quote=Wahhabism, literal and narrow in its exegesis of the Qur'an and hadith regards bida as 'whatever religious practice or concept had come into being after the third century of the Islamic era', or as some ulema argue, those things introduced into society which were not known at the time of Prophet Muhammad (s)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of [[Sufism]], in contrast, argue for an inclusive, holistic definition. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah writes:
{{Quote|[B]id‘a could take on various shades of meaning. When used without qualifying adjectives, it tended to be condemnatory, as, for example, in the statement, "bid‘a must be avoided"” Nevertheless, bid‘a was not always something bad. In certain contexts, especially when qualified by adjectives, bid‘a could cover a wide range of meanings from what was praiseworthy to what was completely wrong, as, for example, in the caliph ‘Umar’s statement below, "what an excellent bid‘a is this!"|Umar Faruq Abd-Allah|Innovation and Creativity in Islam&lt;ref name="Innovation and Creativity In Islam"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abd-Allah|first=Umar Faruq|title=Innovation and Creativity In Islam|url=http://www.nawawi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Article4.pdf|year=2006|publisher=A Nawawi Foundation Paper|pages=2|isbn=1-902350-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In Shia Islam==
According to [[Shia Islam]] the definition of bid'ah is anything that is introduced to Islam as either being [[fard]] (mandatory), [[mustahabb]] (recommended), [[halal]] (neutral), [[makruh]] (reprehensible) or [[haraam|haram]] (forbidden) that contradicts the Qur'an or hadith. Any new good practice introduced that does not contradict the Qur'an or hadith is permissible. However, it is not permissible to say that a new good practice (that does not contradict the Qur'an or hadith) is obligatory, highly recommended or "sunnah" proper. Hence, the Shi'a stance mirrors the body of Sunni scholars who proffer the idea of "bid'ah hasana". As a general rule in Shi'a jurisprudence, anything is permissible except whatever is prohibited through divine revelation (i.e. the Qur'an or hadith).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/bidah/en/chap2.php Answering-Ansar.org :: Bidah (Innovation)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316184846/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/bidah/en/chap2.php |date=March 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes==
Despite the general understanding of standing scholarly disagreements ([[ikhtilaf]]), the notion of lawful innovation is a polarizing issue in the Islamic world.  A practical example of this is the debate over the permissibility of the [[mawlid]] or commemoration of Muhammad's birthday. All scholars agree that such celebrations did not exist in the early period of Islamic history, and yet ''mawalid'' commemorations are a common element in Muslim societies around the world. Even so, Sunnis' scholars are divided between emphatic unconditional condemnation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bin Baz|first=Abd al-Aziz|title=Warning Against Bid'ahs: Ruling on Celebrating the Prophet's Mawlid and Other Events|url=http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?BookID=14&amp;View=Page&amp;PageNo=1&amp;PageID=37|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002606/http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?BookID=14&amp;View=Page&amp;PageNo=1&amp;PageID=37|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 December 2013|work=Fatawa Bin Baz|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conditional acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bin Bayyah|first=Abdullah|title=On Celebrating the Prophet's Birthday|url=http://www.suhaibwebb.com/islam-studies/on-celebrating-the-prophet%E2%80%99s-birthday-sa-sheikh-abdullah-bin-bayyah/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929083233/http://www.suhaibwebb.com/islam-studies/on-celebrating-the-prophet%E2%80%99s-birthday-sa-sheikh-abdullah-bin-bayyah/|archivedate=2011-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the celebration with the former insisting it is a bid'ah and thus automatically unlawful, while the latter argues it nonetheless is contextually permissible.

British historian Sadakat Kadri has noted the change over time in what is considered bid'ah.

Hadith were not written down until the 9th century, at least in part because "traditionialists such as [[Ibn Hanbal]] considered human literature to be an unholy innovation."&lt;ref name=SKHoE2012:187&gt;[[#SKHoE2012|Kadri, ''Heaven on Earth'', 2012]]: p.187&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation changed even for very conservative jurists such as [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] who wrote dozens of books. Ibn Taymiyyah however considered mathematics, a bidah, a false form of knowledge that "does not bring perfection to the human soul, nor save man from castigation of God, nor lead him to a happy life", and forbade its use in determining the beginning of lunar months.&lt;ref&gt;see Nurcholish Madjid, `Ibn Taymiyya on Kalam and Falsafa: A Problem of Reason and Revelation in Islam` (Ph.D. dissertation., University of Chicago, 1984), pp.235-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Very conservative Wahhabis allow the broadcast of television but Indian Deobandi forbid their followers from watching it,&lt;ref name=SKHoE2012:190/&gt; but make use of the more recent invention the internet to issue fatwas.&lt;ref name=SKHoE2012:190&gt;[[#SKHoE2012|Kadri, ''Heaven on Earth'', 2012]]: p.190&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally who died of plague and who did not was explained as simply the will of [[God in Islam|God]] based on al-Bukhari’s al-Sahih hadith,&lt;ref name=SKHoE2012:185&gt;[[#SKHoE2012|Kadri, ''Heaven on Earth'', 2012]]: p.185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|4|56|680}}&lt;/ref&gt; but studying the progress of the [[Black Death]] ([[bubonic plague]]) in the 14th century, scholar [[Ibn al-Khatib]] noted those who died had the plague transmitted to them from "garments, vessels, ear-rings; ... persons ...  by infection of a healthy sea-port by an arrival from an infected land" where as isolated individuals were immune.&lt;ref name="SKHoE2012:185"/&gt; In the [[Muqaddimah]], Ibn Khaldun defends the science of medicine from suggestions that it is an innovation going against the Sunna. "The medicine mentioned in religious tradition ... is in no way part of the divine revelation." It was simply part of "Arab custom and happened to be mentioned in connection with the circumstances of the Prophet, like other things that were customary in his generation." But was "not mentioned in order to imply that [it] is stipulated by the religious law."&lt;ref name=Muqaddimah-387&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibn Khaldun|title=The Muqaddimah : an introduction to history ; in three volumes. 1|date=1967|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlNZ5wmo5LAC&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;dq=The+medicine+mentioned+in+religious+tradition+...+is+in+no+way+part+of+the+divine+revelation+ibn+khaldun&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WH9idGUNsi&amp;sig=7y-kSudi_Zv4mq7b3Ro0777bNDs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwA2oVChMI1MfG05_bxwIVDQuSCh1dowsI#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20medicine%20mentioned%20in%20religious%20tradition%20...%20is%20in%20no%20way%20part%20of%20the%20divine%20revelation%20ibn%20khaldun&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Book of Knowledge'' [[Al-Ghazali]] observed that many phenomena once thought bid'ah had come to be though legally unobjectionable. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]mong the accepted practices of our time are decorating and furnishing the mosques, and expending great sums of money on their ornate construction and fine rugs which were then considered innovations. These were introduced by the pilgrims, since the early Muslims seldom placed anything on the ground during prayer. Similarly disputation and debate are among the most honoured disciples of the day and are numbered among the best meritorious works (qarubat): nevertheless they were among the taboos at the time of the Companions. The same is true of the chanting (talhiri) of the Qur'an and the call for prayer, going to excess in matters of cleanliness and being over fastidious in matters of ceremonial purity, ruling clothes unclean on petty and far-fetched grounds, and, at the same time, being lax in ruling foods lawful and unlawful as well as many other like things.&lt;ref name=ghazali/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He quoted [[Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman]] approvingly: "Strange as it may seem, accepted practices of today are the taboos of a day gone by. ... And the taboos of today are the accepted practices of a day yet to come."&lt;ref name=ghazali&gt;Al-Ghazali, ''[https://archive.org/stream/TheBookOfKnowledgeByImamAl-ghazaliKitabAl-ilmOfImamAl-ghazalis/TheBookOfKnowledgeByImamAl-ghazaliKitabAl-ilmOfImamAl-ghazalisIhya_djvu.txt Book of Knowledge]'', p.206&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coven Celeste''' was the first "official" Gardnerian [[Wiccan]] coven in Canada, founded in the late 1960s by [[Gary Botting]], the grandson of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)]]'s London-based High Priestess Lysbeth Turner, and Botting's wife [[Heather Botting]]. Since [[Heather Botting]]'s initiation by Turner in 1966, the coven has remained matrilineal, with the Bottings' granddaughters Phaydra and Ariadne Gagnon inheriting the [[athame]] as high priestesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heather Botting]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origin ===
The seed of Coven Celeste was planted in Peterborough, Ontario in the summer of 1966 when [[Heather Botting]] met her prospective husband's maternal grandmother, Lysbeth Turner (née Rendle) (1896–1968), the younger sister of [[Thomas Edward Rendle]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], the first British infantryman to receive the [[Victoria Cross]] in the [[First World War]]. Originally from Bristol, Lysbeth Turner had become one of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)]]'s followers in London prior to World War II. She had introduced her grandson [[Gary Botting]] to Gardner in Bloomsbury in 1953. Realizing that most of her Canadian family (including Gary) had become committed Jehovah's Witnesses, during her 1966 visit to Canada Lysbeth lamented to Heather that her tradition of the "Old Religion" (i.e. [[Wicca]]) would be lost forever unless someone "fresh" took up the [[athame]]. Despite her being raised a [[Jehovah's Witness]], Heather knew something about suppressed cultural values since in Ontario she had been forced to deny her [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]]-[[Sioux]] heritage. Now, she rose to the challenge, abandoned the faith of her youth and was initiated into [[witchcraft]], soon afterwards naming her new sacred circle "Coven Celeste"—the first Wiccan coven in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Todd, "University of Victoria chaplain marks solstice with pagan rituals," ''Vancouver Sun'', 16 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Heather and Gary eloped later that year, but kept both their marriage and their new religion a secret from their Jehovah's Witness parents—and especially from the elders in their respective JW congregations in Newmarket and Peterborough.

[[Gary Botting]]'s interest in the occult was fueled by his research as an English major into the life and death of [[Christopher Marlowe]], especially Marlowe's best-known play, ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]''. Botting himself later wrote two plays about [[The School of Night]], a clandestine Elizabethan club dedicated to delving into the occult, membership in which included Marlowe and such notables as [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], [[Baron Cobham]], the [[Earl of Northumberland]], [[Thomas Kyd]], and [[Thomas Harriott]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, ''Harriott!'' (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972); ''The School of Night'', first produced at Crestwood Theatre, Peterborough, Ontario, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the severe social strictures placed upon them by Jehovah's Witnesses, including fear of being disfellowshipped,&lt;ref&gt;Heather and [[Gary Botting]], ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984), pp. 48, 50, 63, 66–70, 90–92, 97, 127–128, 133–135, 144, 146, 149, 159, 161–165, 188–189, 192, 196&lt;/ref&gt; the Bottings stayed in the "broom closet," discussing their new faith only with fellow practicing [[paganism|pagans]]. [[Gary Botting]] later depicted the early formation of the coven and its barely disguised principals in his play ''The Succubus'', produced as a major project by the University of Alberta Department of Drama in 1982. When after Lysbeth Turner's death in 1968 Botting's JW mother discovered the extent of her mother's Wiccan proclivities, she publicly burned most of the pagan artifacts and images that Turner had left behind in a bid to purge her house of "Satan's" influence.&lt;ref&gt;T. Gagnon, "Introduction" to T. Gagnon, ed. ''Streaking! The Collected Poems of Gary Botting'' (Miami: Strategic, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development and growth ===
Coven Celeste remained in the "gestation" phase for four years, and came to full development, with a public profile, after the Bottings moved to Alberta in 1970. [[Heather Botting]] taught "Witchcraft and the Occult" at Red Deer College. By 1974, Coven Celeste was drawing witches from all over the west of Canada to its central "covenstead" in Sylvan Lake, Alberta. True to the Gardnerian tradition, rituals, especially [[sabbats]], were performed in the nude. The Bottings purchased properties in Sylvan Lake, Burnt Lake, Alix and Bentley, Alberta with heavy woods either on or adjacent to their land, and made paths through the woods to hidden altars and sacred circles. As the coven expanded, nudity became optional and it was recognized that all witches were "naked under their gowns."  Before long, floor-length gowns had become the norm. Major rituals were conducted outdoors in the nearby woods except in the dead of winter. The original rituals were created by [[Heather Botting]] ("Lady Aurora") and [[Gary Botting]] ("Lord Pan") using eclectic sources, including adaptations of the rituals of Jessie Wicker Bell (better known as "Lady Sheba") as published in ''The Grimoire of Lady Sheba''.&lt;ref&gt;(St. Paul's, Minnesota: Llewellyn, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Commencing in 1975, the Alberta coven began to "hive", with different members of the coven moving away, taking Coven Celeste's traditional brand of Gardnerian witchcraft with them. Pagan-oriented visitors who had heard of Coven Celeste were made welcome either as observers or participants, and Coven Celeste's influence spread. Michele Favarger of Cobble Hill, BC attended Coven Celeste rituals in Alberta in 1982 and subsequently returned to BC to form the Canadian [[Aquarian Tabernacle Church]] ("ATC") on [[Vancouver Island]], basing it on some of the precepts of Coven Celeste. Later, in British Columbia, the coven incorporated many of the rituals of [[Starhawk]] as published in ''The Spiral Dance''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Spiral Dance]], 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, [[Gary Botting]], who by then had become established as a criminal lawyer in Victoria, BC, represented Starhawk and dozens of other Wiccans charged with criminal contempt of court following the [[Clayoquot protests]] against logging in the [[Clayoquot Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]].&lt;ref name="MacIsaac; Champagne 1994 xi"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIsaac; Champagne|first=Ron; Anne|title=Clayoquot Mass Trials: Defending the Rainforest|year=1994|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Gabriola Island|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Bottings, Favarger, and Favarger's partner and high priest Erik Lindblad successfully campaigned the [[Province of British Columbia]] to recognize Wiccan weddings.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Todd, "University of Victoria chaplain marks solstice with pagan rituals," ''Vancouver Sun'', 16 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995 Coven Celeste had become one of the mainstay covens of Temple of the Lady in Victoria, BC.

== Coven Celeste today ==
The Bottings were divorced in 1999, and the following year Heather married Denis O'Brien, the Mohawk-Irish high priest of Circle of the Moonsong; whereupon she transferred Coven Celeste to her granddaughters Phaydra and Ariadne Gagnon,
along with the secrets of its sacred tools, the athame, white handled knife, pentacle, scourge, cauldron, candle holders, candles, censor, Book of Shadows, and wands cut and manufactured by them under the supervision of their grandfather. In 2010, Lady Aurora was still conducting a prison ministry and as High Priestess of ATC was officially recognized by the Province as an officiator of pagan weddings.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2010/12/16/pagans-celebrate-solstice-with-yule-rituals/&lt;/ref&gt; As a professor of anthropology at the University of Victoria, [[Heather Botting]] was an officially recognized Wiccan chaplain there for more than a decade, the first officially recognized Wiccan chaplain in any university in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Todd; http://theroadtoemmaus.org/RdLb/21PbAr/Apl/NeoPgn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-19-515742-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2004 book by [[Barbara Forrest]] and [[Paul R. Gross]] on the origins of [[intelligent design]], specifically the [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]] and its [[wedge strategy]]. The authors are highly critical of what they refer to as [[intelligent design creationism]],&lt;ref name=intro&gt;[http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/Trojan_Horse_Intro.pdf Introduction to ''Creationism's Trojan Horse''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006181628/http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/Trojan_Horse_Intro.pdf |date=2006-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and document the [[intelligent design movement]]'s [[fundamentalist Christian]] origins and funding.

The book grew out of an essay, "The Wedge at Work: How Intelligent Design Creationism Is Wedging Its Way into the Cultural and Academic Mainstream"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm The Wedge at Work: How Intelligent Design Creationism Is Wedging Its Way into the Cultural and Academic Mainstream], [[Barbara Forrest]]&lt;/ref&gt; which Forrest wrote for the book ''[[Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-262-66124-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2001) edited by [[Robert T. Pennock]].  It is published by [[Oxford University Press]] and has a [[foreword]] by [[Steven Weinberg]].

== Reviews ==
Michael Cavanaugh, President of the [[Institute on Religion in an Age of Science]] called the book "chilling", saying that "It lets one see how totalitarian religious thought can begin to take hold even of a multi-cultural free society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/03/iras_president.html IRAS President reviews ''Creationism’s Trojan Horse''] [[Matt Brauer]], [[The Panda's Thumb weblog]], March 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Giberson]], editor-in-chief of the [[Templeton Foundation]]'s ''[[Science &amp; Theology News]]'' chose it as the July's Editor's Choice and described it as a "remarkable analysis".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stnews.org/Books-758.htm ID movement assaulted in aggressive new polemic] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150220092535/http://www.stnews.org/Books-758.htm |date=2015-02-20 }}, [[Karl Giberson]], ''[[Science &amp; Theology News]]'', July 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Allan H. Harvey reviewed the book for ''[[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]]'', the journal of the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] and criticized the authors' understanding of [[Christian theology]], but wrote that "its thoroughness makes ''Creationism's Trojan Horse'' worth reading for those who are concerned about the movement's influence on public opinion and science education."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Book%20Reviews2005-/6-05.html Review of Forrest and Gross, ''Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design''], [[Allan H. Harvey]], June 2005 issue of ''[[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]]'', journal of the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], (vol. 57, No. 2, p. 157).&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also positive reviews in the [[scientific literature]], by [[Steve Olson (writer)|Steve Olson]] in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/304/5672/825 Evolution and Creationism: Shapes of a Wedge], [[Steve Olson (writer)|Steve Olson]], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 7 May 2004: 825-826&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Rudolf A.

[[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]] reviewed the book for his [[CSICOP]] column and used it to compare ID creationism with [[young Earth creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/id/ IDing ID: Is "Intelligent Design" theory really "Creation Science" version 2.0? Not exactly, but the parallels are certainly suggestive], [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]] August 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologist [[Bruce Grant]] described the authors as "heroes", saying their work was "the most thorough introduction to that enemy [intelligent design creationism]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/04-06-01.html Intentional Deception: Intelligent Design Creationism] by [[Bruce S. Grant]], June 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also had endorsements from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[E.O. Wilson]], [[Ursula Goodenough]], [[Massimo Pigliucci]], [[Eugenie C. Scott]] and [[Steven Pinker]].

== Response by the Discovery Institute ==
The main subject of the book, the [[Discovery Institute]], was highly critical of ''Creationism's Trojan Horse''.  [[Jonathan Witt]] of the [[Discovery Institute]] wrote a review in the theology journal ''[[Philosophia Christi]]'' published by the [[Evangelical Philosophical Society]] and said that it had "erroneous reasoning" and that "on every page of the book, there is a tone of paranoia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epsociety.org/p%20517-519.pdf Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008114922/http://www.epsociety.org/p%20517-519.pdf |date=2006-10-08 }} by [[Jonathan Witt]] of the Discovery Institute in ''[[Philosophia Christi]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Witt and [[John G. West]] of the Discovery Institute also had an article published in the November 2004 edition of ''[[Science &amp; Theology News]]'' entitled "Unraveling The Threads of Darwinist Paranoia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2753 Unraveling The Threads of Darwinist Paranoia], [[John G. West]] and [[Jonathan Witt]], Discovery Institute, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  A month later, Forrest and Gross wrote in ''[[Science &amp; Theology News]]'', with a reply by Witt and West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stnews.org/Books-343.htm Intelligent design has distinctly evolutionary nature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405181950/http://www.stnews.org/books-343.htm |date=2015-04-05 }}, [[Barbara Forrest]] and [[Paul R. Gross]] ''[[Science &amp; Theology News]]'', December 2004, with a reply ''When anti-ID vitriol prevails, scientific debate loses'' by [[John G. West]] and [[Jonathan Witt]]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ian Musgrave]] contributed a letter to the editor in the February 2005 edition replying to West and Witt's reply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-42.htm ID lacks creditable scholarship] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150220092609/http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-42.htm |date=2015-02-20 }}, [[Ian Musgrave]], letter to [[Science &amp; Theology News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research for ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'' ==
The research which Forrest in particular did led to her appearing as an [[expert witness]] for the plaintiffs at the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' intelligent design trial,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/FORREST_EXPERT_REPORT.pdf Expert Witness Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028220124/http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/FORREST_EXPERT_REPORT.pdf |date=2008-10-28 }} for ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', Barbara Forrest&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day6am.html Testimony] of Barbara Forrest, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District''&lt;/ref&gt; in which intelligent design was ruled to be religious creationism and not [[science]], and thus could not be taught as science in public school classrooms of [[Dover, Pennsylvania]] because of the [[Establishment clause]] of the [[US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover_decision.html Kitzmiller v. Dover decision]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, pre-publication drafts of the textbook at the center of the controversy ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' were uncovered which revealed its creationist origins and how it had changed from using creationist terminology to using intelligent design terminology as a result of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]''.  This formed an important part of Forrest's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/10/i_guess_id_real.html I guess ID really was “Creationism’s Trojan Horse” after all] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624124225/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/10/i_guess_id_real.html |date=2008-06-24 }}, [[Nick Matzke]], October 13, 2005, [[The Panda's Thumb (weblog)|The Panda's Thumb]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days before Forrest's testimony, the Discovery Institute published its own "brief history of the scientific theory of intelligent design" by [[Jonathan Witt]], in which he attempts to diminish the importance of Edwards v. Aguillard, claiming instead that the origin of intelligent design was much older.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=526 The Origin of Intelligent Design: A brief history of the scientific theory of intelligent design], [[Jonathan Witt]], [[Discovery Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24936">'''Cyrus the Great in the Quran''' is a theory that holds that the character of [[Dhul-Qarnayn]], mentioned in the [[Quran]], should be identified with [[Cyrus the Great]], or at least he is a better fit than the other proposed figures.

Dhul-Qarnayn ([[Arabic]] for "the two-horned") is mentioned in the Quran. The story of Dhul-Qarnayn appears in sixteen verses of the Quran, specifically the 16 verses [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an|18:83-98]] ([[Al Kahf]]).

There is extensive ongoing debate on who exactly was the historical character of Dhul-Qarnayn, with various historical, mythical, and sacred figures being proposed. The most popular identification, especially by classical Quran commentators, has been with [[Alexander the Great in the Quran|Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leaman|first1=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415326391|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;ots=5WntAJ3lJt&amp;dq=dhu%20al-qarnayn%20%20encyclopedia%20islam&amp;pg=PA183|language=en|pages=182-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, alternative theories supporting other explanations have become dominant. The most prominent of these is the theory that Dhul-Qarnayn was [[Cyrus the Great]], the founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waheed |first1=Sehba |title= Islam: A New Perspective in World-culture |date=2006 |publisher= Icon |isbn= 978-8188086375 |pages=206-7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TvwQAQAAIAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Islam and the Modern Age |volume=36 |date=2005 |page=16 |language=en |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xdbXAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aftabnews.ir/vdcjitex.uqexxzsffu.html&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was first proposed by Indian scholar [[Abul Kalam Azad|Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]] and was later endorsed by many Sunni and Shia scholars and commentators including [[Israr Ahmed]], [[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi|Maududi]], [[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], [[Allameh Tabatabaei]] (in ''[[Tafsir al-Mizan]]''),&lt;ref&gt;In his Vol 26 of his Opus Magnum, ''[[Tafsir al-Mizan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Naser Makarem Shirazi]] (et al., in ''[[Tafsir Nemooneh]]''),&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Bargozideh Tafseer-i Nemuneh'' (برگزیده تفسیر نمونه), Vol 3, p69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]],&lt;ref name=Raheem&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raheem |first1= M.

==Analysis==
Abul Ala [[Maududi]], a 20th-century Quran commentator, writes in his [[Tafsir]]&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?sno=18&amp;tno=940 Surah Al Kahf]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Translated Quran&lt;/ref&gt;
that the identification of Dhul-Qarnain has been a controversial topic among Islamic scholars from the earliest times. Generally, commentators have been of the opinion that  Dhul-Qarnayn is actually [[Alexander the Great]]. However, some characteristics of Dhul-Qarnain described in the Quran, it has been argued, are not applicable to the historical Alexander. The fact that the Alexander-as-Dhul-Qarnain theory actually refers to the semi-mythical Alexander described in the [[Alexander Romance]] makes the connection even more problematic for some Islamic scholars. In recent years some commentators are inclined to believe that Dhul-Qarnain was actually Cyrus The Great, an ancient king of [[Achaemenid]] [[Persia]].

===The characteristics of Dhul-Qarnain in the Quran===
The characteristics of Dhul-Qarnain in the light of his story as given in the Quran are as follows:

'''(1)''' The title Dhul-Qarnain ("The Two-Horned") should have been quite familiar to the Jews, for it was at their instigation that the disbelievers of [[Mecca]] put this question to Muhammad.

According to [[Maududi]]'s commentary on Surah 18 states:

:This Surah was sent down in answer to the three questions which the mushriks of Makkah, in consultation with the people of the Book, had put to the Holy Prophet in order to test him. These were: (1) Who were "the Sleepers of the Cave"? (2) What is the real story of Khidr? and (3) What do you know about Dhul-Qarnain? As these three questions and the stories involved concerned the history of the Christians and the Jews, and were unknown in Hijaz, a choice of these was made to test whether the Holy Prophet possessed any source of the knowledge of the hidden and unseen things. Allah, however, not only gave a complete answer to their questions but also employed the three stories to the disadvantage of the opponents of Islam in the conflict that was going on at that time at Makkah between Islam and un-belief.[http://www.translatedquran.com/SurahIntro.asp?sno=18]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Therefore, one must investigate the Judaic literature and oral tradition available to Jews at the time of Muhammad in order to learn the identity of the person known as "The Two-Horned".

'''(2)''' Dhul-Qarnayn must have been a great ruler and conqueror whose conquests might have spread from the East to the West and then to the North or the South. Before the revelation of the [[Quran]] in  609CE, there were several historical figures who were known to have been conquerors of such caliber.

'''(3)''' This title should be applicable to such a ruler who constructed a strong wall across a mountain pass to protect his kingdom from the incursions of tribes or nations associated with ''[[Gog and Magog]]''. In order to investigate this, one must determine the identity of Gog and Magog. One must also consider where and when such a wall was built, if at all, and by whom.

'''(4)''' Besides possessing the aforementioned characteristics, he should also be a mono-theist and a just ruler, since the Quran has stressed these characteristics more than anything else in the quoted passages. {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; states opinion.|date=October 2013}}

===The characteristics of Cyrus the Great===

'''(1)''' The first of these characteristics may be applicable to Cyrus. The Prophet Daniel, in the Biblical account, saw a vision that the united kingdom of Media and Persia was like a two-horned ram before the rise of the Greeks.

The [[Book of Daniel]] Chapter 8 says:

:''"2 In the vision I was looking and saw myself in [[Susa]] the capital, in the province of [[Elam]], and I was by the river Ulai. 3 I looked up and saw a ram standing beside the river. It had two horns. Both horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up second. 4 I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. All beasts were powerless to withstand it, and no one could rescue from its power; it did as it pleased and became strong. 5 As I was watching, a male goat appeared from the west, coming across the face of the whole earth without touching the ground. The goat had a horn between its eyes. 6 It came toward the ram with the two horns that I had seen standing beside the river, and it ran at it with savage force."''

The ''New Revised Standard Version'' of the [[Bible]] gives the following interpretation from Gabriel: "As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of [[Medes|Media]] and [[Persia]]."

[[File:Two horned elam.jpg|thumb|right|A "two horned" [[Elam]]ite figure wrestling with serpents.]]

 | footer = The relief of [[Cyrus the Great]] near his tomb in [[Pasargadae]], former capital of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. The two horns have been related to the name "Dhul-Qarnayn".
}}

Furthermore, ''two horns'' and two horned symbolism was not an unknown emblem of the kingdoms of Persia and its predecessors, for we see that [[Elam]]ite kings used this symbol routinely in their insignia.

The Jews had a very high opinion of Cyrus the Great, because it was his invasion which brought about the downfall of the kingdom of [[Babylon]] and the liberation of the Israelites.

'''(2)''' The second characteristic is applicable to Cyrus to a great extent but not completely. Though his conquests spread to Syria and Asia Minor in the West and to Bākhtar ([[Balkh]]) in the East, there is no trace of any of his great expeditions to the North or to the South, whereas the Quran makes an explicit mention of his third expedition. However some historians do verify the probability of such a voyage. Nevertheless, this third expedition is not completely out of question for history tells us that Cyrus' kingdom extended to [[Caucasus|Caucasia]] in the North.

'''(3)''' As regards Gog and Magog, it has been established that they were the wild tribes of Central Asia who were known by different names: [[Scythians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[Tartars]], [[Mongols]], and [[Huns]], who had been making incursions on various kingdoms and empires from very ancient times. It is also known that strong bulwarks had been built in southern regions of Caucasia, though it has yet to be determined historically whether these were built by Cyrus.

'''(4)''' As regards the third characteristic, Cyrus is the only known conqueror among the ancient rulers, to whom this may be applicable, for even his enemies have been full of praise for him for his justice, and, [[Ezra]], asserts that he was a God-worshiper and a God-fearing king who set free the Israelites because of his God-worship, and ordered that the [[Temple of Solomon]] be rebuilt for the worship of God.

Thus in the light of the above, it is possible to conclude that of all the historical conquerors who had died before the revelation of the Quran, Cyrus alone is the one to whom the characteristics of "Dhul-Qarnain" are most applicable. There is no other historical conquerors to whom the characteristics stated in the Quran are as much applicable as to Cyrus.

The historical Cyrus was a Persian ruler whose rise began about 549 BCE. Within a few years he had conquered the kingdoms of [[Medes|Media]] and [[Lydia]]; by 539 BCE he had conquered [[Babylon]]. There was no powerful kingdom left to oppose him. His conquests extended eastward to Turkistan; westward to [[Ionia]]; northward to [[Caucasus|Caucasia]]—covering, in fact, much of the known civilized world.

===Journey towards the West===
[[File:Persia-Cyrus2-World3.png|thumb|300px|The [[Achaemenid Empire]] after Cyrus's conquests.]]

According to [[Ibn Kathir]], it means that he followed a route to the West of the earth until he reached the last boundary of the land, beyond which there was ocean. Verse 18:86 says: "He found it setting in a muddy spring" (Pickthall). If Dhul-Qarnain was Cyrus, then that place would be the western limit of [[Asia Minor]] and the "muddy spring" (or "warm spring" according to some hadiths&lt;ref&gt;Some hadiths have warm instead of muddy - the words are very similar - or even black mud, and al-Tabari also discusses the variant readings [https://quranspotlight.wordpress.com/articles/dhul-qarnayn-sunset-sunrise/#_Toc296019738 See here for discussion and endnote 76 for Arabic citation], and [https://quranspotlight.wordpress.com/articles/dhul-qarnayn-sunset-sunrise/#_Toc296019737 here] for another hadith that comes in both versions&lt;/ref&gt;) would be the [[Aegean Sea]]. The word "`ain" in Quran verse 18:86 means spring or source of water from the ground, as in other verses according to Lane's Lexicon:

:''The place [or aperture] whence the water of a قَنَاة [i.e. pipe or the like,] pours forth : (K, TA:) as being likened to the organ [of sight] because of the water that is in it. (TA.) And, (K, TA,) for the same reason, (TA,) ‡ The place whence issues the water of a well. (TA.) And, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) for the same reason, as is said by Er-Rághib, (TA,) ‡ The عَيْن (S, Msb,) or source, or spring, (K, TA,) of water, (S, Wsb, K, TA,) that wells forth from the earth, or ground, and runs : (TA: [and accord. To the Msb, it app. Signifies a running spring:] of the fem. gender''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume1/00000193.pdf Lane's Lexicon book 1, page 2215]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "bahr" (not used in this verse) means sea or large body of water&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume1/00000193.pdf Lane's Lexicon book 1, page 156]&lt;/ref&gt; and appears in many other verses in the Quran to mean sea.

===Journey towards the East===
That is, when he advanced towards the East in Babylon, the people, who had no shelter were the captured tribes of Israel. The reason the Quran mentions no more on the topic is because the whole epic is written in the Book of Kings, of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Quran simply says at 18:90, "To the extent that when he reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising upon a nation for which We had not kept any shelter from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surah Kahf|url=http://www.barkati.net/quran/Translation/holyquran018.htm|work=Surah Kahf Translation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journey towards the North/Gog and Magog===
The "two mountains" must have been parts of that mountain range which runs between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Black Sea]]. This must be, for beyond them was the territory of Gog and Magog. "It was difficult to communicate with them: their language was almost foreign to Dhul-Qarnain and his companions, and, as they were quite barbaric, none could understand their language, nor were they acquainted with any foreign language."

As has already been pointed out, Gog and Magog were the wild tribes of North Eastern Asia which, from the very early times had been making inroads on settled kingdoms and empires in Asia and Europe and ravaging them. According to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (Chapter 10), they were the descendants of [[Japheth]], the son of [[Noah]], and the Muslim historians have also accepted this. And according to the book of [[Ezekiel]] (Chapters 38, 39), they inhabited the territories of Meshech ([[Moscow]]) and Tubal ([[Tubalsek]]). According to the 1st century CE Israelite historian Josephus, Magog were called [[Scythians]] by the Greeks,&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews Book 1, Chapter 6, verse 1 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link2HCH0006 Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; and their territory spread to the north and the east of the Black Sea. However, Josephus also says that the Scythians had been shut up behind an iron gate built across a passage by Alexander [the Great].&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews, Book VII, Chapter VII, Verse 4 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/2850-h.htm#link72HCH0007 Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jerome, Magog inhabited the territory to the north of Caucasia near the Caspian Sea:

:''The hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from Maeotis (they had their haunts between the icy Tanais and the rude Massagetae, where the gates of Alexander keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-06/Npnf2-06-03.htm#P3201_835203 Letter 77 "To Oceanus", 8, Jerome]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wall of Cyrus to protect from Gog &amp; Mogog===
He said: "Though I have built a very strong iron-wall, as far as it was possible for me, it is not ever-lasting, for it will last only as long as Allah wills, and will fall down to pieces when the time of my Lord's promise shall come. Then no power in the world shall be able to keep it safe and secure."

Some people have entertained the misunderstanding that the wall attributed here to Dhul-Qarnain refers to the famous [[Great Wall of China]], whereas this wall was built between [[Derbent]] and [[Darial Gorge|Dar'yal]], two cities of [[Republic of Dagestan|Daghestan]] in the Caucasus, the land that lies between the Black Sea and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]]. There are high mountains between the Black Sea and Dar'yal having deep gorges which cannot allow large armies to pass through them. Between Derbent and Dar'yal, however, there are no such mountains and the passes also are wide and passable. In ancient times savage hordes from the north invaded and ravaged southern lands through these passes and the Persian rulers who were fearful of them had to build a strong wall, 50 miles long, 29 feet high and 10 feet wide, for fortification purposes, ruins of which can still be seen (e.g. [[Great Wall of Gorgan]]).&lt;ref&gt;UC Berkeley's page on archaeologist [[David Stronach]]: {{cite web |url=http://sscl.berkeley.edu/arf/main/stronach.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108144233/http://sscl.berkeley.edu/arf/main/stronach.html |archivedate=2005-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it has not yet been established historically who built this wall in the beginning, Muslim historians and geographers assign it to Dhul-Qarnain because its remains correspond with the description of it given in the Quran, despite the fact that the wall is in fact Sassanid in origins, and thus is about 1000 years too late to have been built by Cyrus. "The OSL and radiocarbon samples demonstrated conclusively that both walls had been built in the 5th or, possibly, 6th century AD".&lt;ref&gt;Omrani Rekavandi, H., Sauer, E., [[Tony Wilkinson|Wilkinson, T.]] &amp; Nokandeh, J. (2008), The enigma of the red snake: revealing one of the world’s greatest frontier walls, Current World Archaeology, No. 27, February/March 2008, pp. 12-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Jarir [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]] and [[Ibn Kathir]] have recorded the event, and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] has mentioned it in his Mujam-ul-Buldan that: ''when after the conquest of Azerbaijan, Umar sent Suraqah bin `Amr, in 22 A.H. (643CE) on an expedition to Derbent, the latter appointed `Abdur Rahman bin Rabi`ah as the chief of his vanguard. When 'Abdur Rehman entered [[Armenia]], the ruler Shehrbaz surrendered without fighting. Then when `Abdur Rehman wanted to advance towards Derbent, Shehrbaz informed him that he had already gathered full information about the wall built by Dhul-Qarnain, through a man, who could supply all the necessary details and then the man was actually presented before `Abdur Rehman. (Tabari, Vol. III, pp. 235–239; Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, Vol. VII, pp. 122–125, and Mu'jam-ul-Buldan, under Bab-ul-Abwab: Derbent).''

Two hundred years later, the Abbasid Caliph [[Al-Wathiq]] dispatched a party of 50 men under Sallam-ul-Tarjuman to study the wall of Dhul-Qarnain, whose observations have been recorded in great detail by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] in Mu jam-ul-Buldan and by [[Ibn Kathir]] in Al-Bidayah. They write:

''this expedition reached Samarrah from where they reached [[Tbilisi]] and then through As-Sarir and Al-Lan, they reached Filanshah, from where they entered the Caspian territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall. (Al-Bidayah Vol. II, p. 111, Vol. VII, pp. 122–125; Mu jam-ul-Buldan: under Bab-ul-Abwab).'' This clearly shows that even up until the tenth century, Muslim scholars regarded this wall of the Caucasus as the wall of Dhul-Qarnain.

Yaqut in his Mu jam-ul-Buldan has further confirmed the same view at a number of places. For instance, under Khazar ([[Caspian Sea|Caspian]]) he writes:

:"This territory adjoins the Wall of Dhul-Qarnain just behind Bab-ul-Abwab, which is also called Derbent." In the same connection, he records a report by Ahmad bin Fadhlan, the ambassador of Caliph [[Al-Muqtadir]], who has given a full description of the Caspian land, saying that Caspian is the name of a country whose capital is Itil (near the present Astrakhan) right through which flows River Itil, which joins the Caspian front Russia and Bulghar.
Regarding Bab-ul-Abwab he says that this city is called both Al-Bab and Derbent, which is a highly difficult passage for the people coming from the northern lands towards the south. Once this territory was a part of the kingdom of Nausherwan, and the Persian rulers paid particular attention to strengthening their frontiers on that side.''

About Dhul-Qarnain, Muhammad Ali says (p586):
The word qarn means a horn, as also a generation or a century and dhul qarnain literally means the two-horned one, or one belonging to the two generations or two centuries. The reference here seems to be to the two horned ram of Daniel's vision (Dan. 8:3), which he interpreted as the Kingdoms of Media and Persia, which were combined into a single kingdom under one ruler, Cyrus, who is erroneously called Darius in the Bible. The reference in Daniel's vision is, however, not to Cyrus but to Darius I Hystaspes (521-485 B.C.), "who allowed the Jews to rebuild their temple, and is referred to in Ezra 4:5,24;5:5;6:1;Hag1:1;2:10;Zech. 1;7, and probably in Neh. 12:22. His liberality towards the Jews is in complete accord with what we know otherwise of his general policy in religious matter towards the subject nations"

Maududi says:
{Early commentators on the Quran were generally inclined to believe that it
referred to Alexander. The characteristics attribute to Dhul-Qarnayn,
however, hardly apply to Alexander. In the light of the latest historical
evidence, contemporary commentators on the Quran are inclined to believe
that Dhul-Qarnayn signifies the [[Kings of Persia|Persian Emperor]], Cyrus. This, in any case,
seems more plausible. Nevertheless, the info available to date does not
enable one to form a definitive opinion concerning Dhul-Qarnayn's identity.

* Key points:

# The title "The Two-Horned' was at least familiar to the [[Jews]]. This is evident from the fact they had instigated the [[Mecca]]n unbelievers to ask the Prophet about him.  One must, therefore, inevitably turn to Jewish literature or oral traditions from the time of Muhammed to find out who this person was or to establish what was the kingdom known as 'The Two-Horned.'
# (in summary of Maududi) there are only a few people who fit this description
# The title of Dhul-Qarnayn may be used for a ruler who, being concerned with the defense of his kingdom from the assaults of Gog and Magog, had a strong protective wall constructed across a mountain pass.
# He is a God conscious person.

* Dhul-Qarnayn expanded his empire in three directions (east, west and north), which is the same as Cyrus' expansions, where he did not make southern expansions (Achaemenid southern expansions began after Cyrus). It should be noted that Alexander made his expansions towards south and east.

'''Devdaha''' ('''Dev Daha''', '''देवदह''') is a [[municipality]] in [[Rupandehi District]] of Nepal, the ancient capital of '''Koliya Kingdom''', located 57&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Lumbini]] and east of [[Butwal]]  and shares a border with [[Nawalparasi]] district on the east side.  It is identified  as the maternal home of Queen Mayadevi, Prajapati Gautami and Princess Yasodhara. There are many places to visit in Devdaha. It is believed that Prince Siddhartha had spent some years of his childhood with his step-mother/aunt Prajapati Gautami in Devdaha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lumbinidevtrust.gov.np/introduction/ramagrama-devadaha/|title=Lumbini Development Trust- Birthplace of Buddha, Historical Place of Nepal, The World Heritage Site|work=Lumbini Development Trust|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Devdaha was a township of the [[koliya]]n in what is now the Rupandehi District of Nepal. The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] stayed there during his tours and preached to the [[bhikkhu|monks]] on various topics.&lt;ref&gt;S.iii.5f; iv.124f; M.ii.214&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Commentaries,&lt;ref&gt;J.i.52; BuA.226; MA.ii.924, 1021, etc; ThigA.182&lt;/ref&gt; it was the city of birth of the Buddha's mother ([[Mayadevi]]), and of [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Pajāpatī Gotamī]] and their companions ([[Koliya]]ns), who married the Sākiyans of [[Kapilavatthu]].

==Origin of the name==
In Sanskrit Language, Deva means god and Daha means a pond hence the literal meaning of Devdaha is "''pond of a God''". It is believed that the gods and goddesses and saints bathed in this pond. Prince Siddartha himself is believed to have bathed in this holy pond during his visit here in Devdaha.  Because it came into existence without human intervention, hence divine ([[Pali]]: ''sayañjāto vā so daho, tasmā pi Devadaho'') and the water of this holy pond was supplied in the Koliya Palace. The ancient Koliya Kingdom and present Devdaha received its name Devdaha from this very holy pond.&lt;ref&gt;SA. ii. 186; also MA.ii.810&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Buddhist text [[Dulva]] ([[William Woodville Rockhill|Rockhill]], p.&amp;nbsp;12), the city was founded by Sākiyans from Kapilavatthu, when they grew very numerous. The spot was pointed out by a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]], hence its name.

=== Bhawanipur(भवानीपुर) ===
[[File:Ashoka Pillar Bhawanipur Rupandehi.jpg|thumb|Pillar in Bhawanipur Rupandehi.]]
The historical site of Bhawanipur, also known as Devidamar, is located 4&amp;nbsp;km South of Mahendra Highway at Devdaha Municipality Ward No. 4. It is believed to have been ancient Devdaha, capital of the Koliya. The site consists of a temple dedicated to the Queen Mayadevi and other archaeological sites. Significants religious and archaeological and objects here include a long stone column(some consider it to be an Ashoka Pillar), stone image of Sun God, ancient brick well etc. Structural wall of ancient constructions are visible even at the surface level here.

=== Kanya Mai Temple(कन्या माइ मन्दिर  ) ===
Located at '''''Devdaha''''' Municipality just 1 Km south from the junction of ''Shitalnagar'', the ''Kanya Mai Temple'' is believed to be built in the memory of ''Queen Prajapati Gautami'', the step mother of Lord Buddha. Major images found in the temple, include standing image of ''Lokeshwore'' holding Lotus flower in one hand, while the other is broken off, and many stone idols. Ancient potteries are still visible on the near by mound. Excavation  carried out by the ''Department of Archaeology'' and LDT have uncovered several structural ruins and stone antiquities at these sites.

The structures of traditional palace and well also have been uncovered during the excavation of 2011 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://visitdevdaha.com/kanyamai/|title=KAnya Mai|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devdaha Park ===
Prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] was born in [[Lumbini]] while Queen Maya Devi was on her way to Devdaha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Centre |first1= UNESCO World Heritage |title= Lumbini, the Birthplace of the Lord Buddha - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666|website=whc.unesco.org |accessdate= 4 July 2016 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Maya Devi died on the seventh day of Siddhartha's birth. He was then brought up by his second mother, Queen Prajapati Gautami. During his childhood, Prince Siddhartha paid several visits to Devdaha. After seven years of his Enlightenment, Prince Siddhartha &amp;ndash; now Gautama Buddha &amp;ndash; again visited Devdaha and was greatly welcomed there.

This Park is the eastern front gate of Devdaha. It contains a huge garden and a pagoda. There is a big statue of Buddha ({{convert|7|ft|disp=or}}) and a gilded statue of [[Sariputra]].

{{italic title}}
The '''''Emerald Tablet''''', also known as the '''''Smaragdine Tablet''''', or '''''Tabula Smaragdina''''', is a compact and cryptic piece of the ''[[Hermetica]]'' reputed to contain the secret of the [[prima materia]] and its [[chrysopoeia|transmutation]]. It was highly regarded by European [[alchemy|alchemists]] as the foundation of their art and its [[hermeticism|Hermetic]] tradition. The original source of the ''Emerald Tablet'' is unknown. Although [[Hermes Trismegistus]] is the author named in the text, its first known appearance is in a book written in Arabic between the sixth and eighth centuries. The text was first translated into Latin in the twelfth century. Numerous translations, interpretations and commentaries followed.

The layers of meaning in the ''Emerald Tablet'' have been associated with the creation of the [[philosopher's stone]], [[laboratory]] experimentation, [[phase transition]], the [[alchemy|alchemical]] [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|magnum opus]], [[mystical psychosis]], [[cosmic consciousness]], [[unus mundus]], [[anima mundi]], [[The All]] (of [[Hermetism]]/[[Hermeticism]]), successful [[Pregnancy|child conception]] out of proved pure [[love]], [[Classical element#Ancient classic element systems|the ancient, classical, element system]], and the correspondence between [[macrocosm and microcosm]].

Similarities and correspondences with the ''Emerald Tablet'' have been drawn with Eastern philosophies like [[Daoism]] ([[Tao Te Ching]], [[Tao]], [[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], [[YinYang]], and the ''[[I Ching]]''), [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]], and even with the [[Book of Genesis]] and [[Book of Isaiah]] of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]].

==Textual history==
The text of the ''Smaragdine Tablet'' gives its author as [[Hermes Trismegistus]] ("Hermes the Thrice-Greatest"), a legendary [[Hellenistic]]&lt;ref&gt;Hart, G., ''The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses'', 2005, Routledge, second edition, Oxon, p 158&lt;/ref&gt; combination of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Hermes]] and the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Thoth]].&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 415)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the claims of antiquity, it's believed to be an Arabic work written between the sixth and eighth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]. ''The Western Esoteric Traditions : A Historical Introduction.'' Oxford University Press, 2008. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest documentable source of the text is the "Kitab Balaniyus al-Hakim fi'l-`Ilal ''Kitāb sirr al-ḫalīqa''" {{lang|ar|كتاب سر الخليقة و صنعة الطبيعة أو كتاب العلل للحكيم بلنياس}} (book of Balinas the wise on the Causes) written in Arabic between the sixth and eighth centuries. This volume is attributed to "Balinas" (or Pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana) &lt;ref&gt;Katharine Park, Lorraine Daston. ''The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science''. Cambridge University Press, 2006. p.502&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Balinas frames the ''Emerald Tablet'' as ancient Hermetic wisdom. He tells his readers that he discovered the text in a vault below a statue of Hermes in [[Tyana]], and that, inside the vault, an old corpse on a golden throne held the emerald tablet.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Ebeling. ''The Secret History of Hermes Trismegistus: Hermeticism from Ancient to Modern Times.'' Cornell University Press, 2007. p. 46-47, 96&lt;/ref&gt;
The laws of hermeticism:
Following Balinas, an early version of the ''Emerald Tablet'' appeared in Kitab Sirr al-Asrar:  (''Book of the Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature''), itself a composite of earlier works, and in  ''Kitab Ustuqus al-Uss al-Thani'' (''Second Book of the Elements of Foundation'') attributed to [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Th Houtsma. ''First Encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936'' p. 594&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Smaragdine Tablet'' was first translated into Latin in the twelfth century by [[Hugo of Santalla]].&lt;ref&gt;Florian Ebeling. ''The Secret History of Hermes Trismegistus: Hermeticism from Ancient to Modern Times.'' Cornell University Press, 2007. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The text is also in an enlarged thirteenth century edition of ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' (also known as ''Kitab Sirr al-Asrar'').

===Newton's translation===
A translation by [[Isaac Newton]] is found among his [[alchemy|alchemical]] papers that are currently housed in King's College Library, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]]. [http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/newton/ALCH00017 "Keynes MS. 28"]. The Chymistry of Isaac Newton. Ed. William R. Newman. June 2010. Retrieved March 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Tis true without lying, certain &amp; most true.
That which is below is like that which is above &amp; that which is above is like that which is below to do the miracles of one only thing
And as all things have been &amp; arose from one by the meditation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.
The Sun is its father, the moon its mother, the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth is its nurse. 
The father of all perfection in the whole world is here. 
Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.
Separate thou the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross sweetly with great industry. 
It ascends from the earth to the heaven &amp; again it descends to the earth &amp; receives the force of things superior &amp; inferior.
By this means you shall have the glory of the whole world 
&amp; thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.
Its force is above all force. For it vanquishes every subtle thing &amp; penetrates every solid thing.
So was the world created.
From this are &amp; do come admirable adaptations whereof the means (or process) is here in this. Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world
That which I have said of the operation of the Sun is accomplished &amp; ended.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Latin text===
[[File:Table Emeraude Chrysogonus.jpg|thumb|250px|Latin text of the ''Emerald Tablet'', from ''[[De Alchemia]]'', Chrysogonus Polydorus, Nuremberg 1541&lt;ref&gt;Chrysogonus Polydorus. ''[https://archive.org/details/alchemiaegebriar00jabi Alchemiae Gebri Arabis philosophi solertissimi libri, cum reliquis, ut versa pagella indicabit]''. 1545.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Original edition of the [[Latin]] text. (''Chrysogonus Polydorus'', [[Nuremberg]] 1541):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Verum, sine mendacio, certum et verissimum:
Quod est inferius est sicut quod est superius, et quod est superius est sicut quod est inferius, ad perpetranda miracula rei unius.
Et sicut res omnes fuerunt ab uno, meditatione unius, sic omnes res natae ab hac una re, adaptatione.
Pater eius est Sol. Mater eius est Luna, portavit illud Ventus in ventre suo, nutrix eius terra est. 
Pater omnis telesmi&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes written ''Thelesmi''. This indicates a Greek origin. The Latin word "Tela" (ae,fem.) roughly means "loom" or "incomplete cloth". The true meaning of the word is somewhat obscure. On the other hand, ''telesmi'' appears to be the Latin translitteration of the plural form of the Greek word ''τελεσμός'' (''telesmós''), whose meaning is "consecration"; see: Lorenzo Rocci, ''Vocabolario greco-italiano'', Roma-Città di Castello, Ed. Soc. Dante Alighieri - Ed. S. Lapi, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; totius mundi est hic.
Virtus eius integra est si versa fuerit in terram.
Separabis terram ab igne, subtile ab spisso, suaviter, magno cum ingenio.
Ideo fugiet a te omnis obscuritas.
Haec est totius fortitudinis fortitudo fortis, quia vincet omnem rem subtilem, omnemque solidam penetrabit.
Sic mundus creatus est.
Hinc erunt adaptationes mirabiles, quarum modus est hic. Itaque vocatus sum Hermes Trismegistus, habens tres partes philosophiae totius mundi.
Completum est quod dixi de operatione Solis.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence==
In its several Western recensions, the ''Tablet'' became a mainstay of medieval and [[Renaissance]] alchemy. Commentaries and/or translations were published by, among others, [[Trithemius]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Michael Maier]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. The concise text was a popular summary of alchemical principles, wherein the secrets of the [[philosopher's stone]] were thought to have been described.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton Linden. ''The Alchemy Reader: From Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton.'' Cambridge University Press, 2003 p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourteenth century alchemist [[Ortolanus]] (or Hortulanus) wrote a substantial exegesis on ''The Secret of Hermes'', which was influential on the subsequent development of alchemy. Many manuscripts of this copy of the ''Emerald Tablet'' and the commentary of Ortolanus survive, dating at least as far back as the fifteenth century. Ortolanus, like Albertus Magnus before him saw the tablet as a cryptic recipe that described laboratory processes using ''deck names'' (or [[code words]]). This was the dominant view held by Europeans until the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and Early McDern Chemistry: Papers from Ambix.'' Jeremy Mills Publishing, 2004. p.415&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early sixteenth century, the writings of [[Johannes Trithemius]] (1462–1516) marked a shift away from a laboratory interpretation of the ''Emerald Tablet'', to a literal approach.  Trithemius equated Hermes' ''one thing'' with the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|monad of pythagorean philosophy]] and the [[anima mundi]]. This interpretation of the Hermetic text was adopted by alchemists such as [[John Dee]], [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] and [[Gerhard Dorn]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and Early McDern Chemistry: Papers from Ambix.'' Jeremy Mills Publishing, 2004. p.415&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.G. Jung]] identified ''The Emerald Tablet'' with a table made of green stone which he encountered in the first of a set of his dreams and visions beginning at the end of 1912, and climaxing in his writing ''[[Seven Sermons to the Dead]]'' in 1916.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Historians of science, [[Eric John Holmyard]] (1891-1959) and [[Julius Ruska]] (1867-1949) also studied the tablet in the twentieth century. Because of its longstanding popularity, the ''Emerald Tablet'' is the only piece of non-Greek [[Hermetica]] to attract widespread attention in the West.

==In popular culture==
In the [[television]] series ''[[Dark (TV series)|Dark]]'', the mysterious priest Noah has a large image of the ''Emerald Tablet'' tattooed on his back. The image also appears on a metal door in the caves that are central to the plot. Several characters are shown looking at copies of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/netflix-dark-theories-burning-questions-jonas-tattoo-wallpaper-1201905484/|title=‘Dark’ Theories and Burning Questions: Jonas’ Fate, the Wallpapered Room, and That Massive Back Tattoo|access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the sixth episode of the series is named after a line from the Latin version, "Sic mundus creatus est."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fathersonholygore.com/2017/12/04/dark-season-1-episode-6-sic-mundus-creatus-est/|title=Dark – Season 1, Episode 6: “Sic Mundus Creatus Est”|date=2017-12-04|work=Father Son Holy Gore|access-date=2018-02-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Brazil]]ian singer [[Jorge Ben Jor]] recorded a studio album under the name ''A Tábua de Esmeralda'' (“The Emerald Tablet”), quoting from the Tablet’s text and from alchemy in general in several songs. The album has been defined as an exercise in “musical alchemy” and celebrated as Ben Jor’s greatest musical achievement, blending together [[samba]], [[jazz]] and [[rock (music)| rock]] rythmes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21586">The [[Constitution of Moldova|Constitution]] provides for freedom of religion, and the [[Government of Moldova|Government]] generally respects this right in practice; however, the 1992 Law on Religions, which codifies religious freedoms, contains restrictions that inhibit the activities of unregistered religious groups. Although the law was amended in 2002, many of the restrictions remain in place. The law provides for freedom of religious practice, including each person's right to profess his or her religion in any form. It also protects the confidentiality of the confessional, allows denominations to establish associations and foundations, and states that the Government may not interfere in the religious activities of denominations. The law specifies that "in order to organize and function", religious organizations must be registered with the Government, and unregistered groups may not own property, engage employees, or obtain space in public cemeteries in their own names.

There is no state religion; however, the [[Metropolis of Chişinău and Moldova]] receives some favored treatment from the Government. The [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of Chişinău and Moldova has a diplomatic passport. Other high-ranking Orthodox Church officials also reportedly have diplomatic passports issued by the Government.

The procedures for registering a religious organization are the same for all groups. In 2002, Parliament adopted amendments to the Law on Religions. A religious organization wishing to register must present a declaration of creation, by-laws, and an explanation of its basic religious beliefs to the State Service on Religious Issues. The State Service on Religious Issues enters the religious organization into the Register of Religions within 30 working days. Under the new procedures, at the request of the State Service on Religious Issues, a court can annul the recognition of the religious organization if the organization "carries out activities that harm the independence, sovereignty, integrity, and security of the Republic of Moldova, the public order, or are connected with political activities." The amendments also provide that religious organizations are prohibited from including in their by-laws any provisions that would violate the Constitution or any other laws.

The Government has recognized and registered 21 religious organizations, many of which are umbrella organizations with sub-entities throughout the country. Although the 2002 amendments to the Law on Religions were intended to simplify the registration process and make the process essentially automatic, the State Service on Religious Issues continues to deny the registration of somegroups, such as the Spiritual Organization of Muslims. Members of this organization repeatedly tried to register with the State Service on Religious Issues and their applications were denied because the State Service claimed their documents were not in order. A number of other organizations have been denied registration or encountered difficulties in connection with their registration applications.

In 1999, amendments to the Law on Religions legalizing proselytizing went into effect. However, the law explicitly forbids "abusive proselytizing", which is defined as an attempt to influence an individual's religious faith through violence or abuse of authority.

In 2002, a new draft Law on Religions, which contained numerous contentious provisions, was circulated. The draft law originally contained numerous restrictive measures. The draft law has since been revised, and it appears that many of the restrictive articles have been deleted.

In February 2003, a new Law on Combating Extremism was passed by Parliament and took effect in March 2003. Critics of the law raised concerns that the law could be used to abuse opposition organizations, which could include religious organizations or individuals who may support or have political ties to certain parties. But in practice this law had never been used against any religious organizations.

A new Criminal Code, adopted by Parliament in April 2002 and in effect since June 2003, includes an article which permits punishment for "preaching religious beliefs or fulfillment of religious rituals, which cause harm to the health of citizens, or other harm to their persons or rights, or instigate citizens not to participate in public life or of the fulfillment of their obligations as citizens." Drafters allegedly copied the passage almost word-for-word from the previous code, which was passed in 1961 when the country was part of the Soviet Union. No organization was prosecuted under this new code.

Article 200 of the Administrative Offenses Code, which was adopted in 1985, prohibits any religious activities of registered or unregistered religions that violate current legislation. The article also allows for the expulsion of foreign citizens who engage in religious activities without the consent of authorities. The Spiritual Organization of Muslims has reported being fined under this provision of law for holding its religious services in a location registered to a charitable organization. The Government charged that their activities are not in line with the stated activities and purposes of the charitable organization.

Foreign missionaries are permitted to enter the country for 90 days on a tourist visa. They have no advantages over other foreigners who wish to stay in the country for longer periods.

In 2000, Parliament amended the Law on Education to make "moral and spiritual instruction" mandatory for primary school students and optional for secondary and university students. The program was introduced gradually, beginning in 2001, for first graders, and then in 2002 and 2003 for second and third graders, respectively. In some schools, there is a class specifically on religion, although this course is conditioned on a request and approval by the parents, and the availability of funds to cover the cost of the course. There are a number of theological institutes, seminaries, and other places of religious education in the country.

Two public schools and a kindergarten are open only to Jewish students, and a kindergarten in Chişinău has a special "Jewish group". These schools receive the same funding as other state schools and are supplemented by financial support from the community. However, Jewish students are not restricted to these schools. There are no comparable schools for other religious faiths and no reports of such schools for other religious faiths. [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]] operates a private boys' [[yeshiva]] and a girls' yeshiva, both licensed by the Ministry of Education. The total enrollment of both schools is fewer than 100 students. Total enrollment for all Jewish related schools, including those operated by Agudath Israel and public schools, is approximately 300.

The authorities in Transnistria also impose registration requirements that negatively affect religious groups and have denied registration to some groups. In April, a new draft Law on Religions, which reportedly contained numerous contentious provisions, was brought before the Transnistrian Supreme Soviet. Following strong objections from the Orthodox Bishop of Tiraspol and some legislators, the draft was sent back for revisions. Despite these protests, the objectionable provisions of the draft law are reportedly strongly supported by a number of high-level authorities in Transnistria.

== Restrictions on Religious Freedom ==
{{see also|Moldovan Orthodox Church|Metropolis of Bessarabia}}
The Law on Religions contains restrictions that have inhibited the activities of unregistered religious groups, and the Government continued to deny registration to some religious groups.

Unregistered religious organizations are not permitted to buy land or obtain construction permits for churches or seminaries. In some cases, members of unregistered religious groups hold services in homes, nongovernmental organization (NGO) offices, and other locations. In other cases, the groups obtain property and permits in the names of individual members. Individual churches or branches of officially registered religious organizations are not obliged to register with local authorities; however,the local branch must register locally if it wants to make legal transactions as a legal body, including the ability to receive donations in its name.

Between the two autonomous [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches ([[Moldovan Orthodox Church]] belonging to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and [[Metropolis of Bessarabia]] belonging to the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]) there is an ongoing politically charged succession dispute, which, from an ecclesiastical point of view, is an administrative only issue (subject to [[canon law]]s), not a theological one, the two belonging respectively to two [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] Churches (of Russia and of Romania), which are within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[full communion|communion]].
Thus, in 2001, the Government declared the [[Moldovan Orthodox Church]] the successor of the pre-[[World War II]] [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] for purposes of all property ownership. The [[Metropolis of Bessarabia]] was reactivated in 1992 (after Moldova declared independence in 1991) when a number of priests broke away from the Moldovan Orthodox Church, and was only officially recognized in 2002, after years of being denied recognition. The dispute was brought in front of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) which ruled in 2004 in favor of the Metropolis of Bessarabia as the "spiritual, canonical, historical successor of the Metropolitan See of Bessarabia which functioned till 1944, including".&lt;ref name="press-rel-20080221"&gt;cf. press release: [http://www.patriarhia.ro/Site/Stiri/2008/PDF/Mbasarabia%20eng.pdf A legitimate act for defending the Romanian identity - Explanations concerning the juridical recognition of the Metropolitan See of Bessarabia and of the suffragan eparchies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227161039/http://www.patriarhia.ro/Site/Stiri/2008/PDF/Mbasarabia%20eng.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}, [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Patriarchy]], 21 February 2008. {{en icon}} — {{cite web |url=http://www.patriarhia.ro/Site/Stiri/2008/PDF/Mbasarabia%20fra.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227161035/http://www.patriarhia.ro/Site/Stiri/2008/PDF/Mbasarabia%20fra.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }} {{fr icon}} — {{cite web |url=http://www.patriarhia.ro/Site/Stiri/2008/040.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226070744/http://www.patriarhia.ro/Site/Stiri/2008/040.html |archivedate=2008-02-26 |df= }} {{ro icon}} — {{cite web |url=http://www.patriarhia.ro/Site/Stiri/2008/PDF/MBasarabiei%20rus.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227161044/http://www.patriarhia.ro/Site/Stiri/2008/PDF/MBasarabiei%20rus.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2004, the Supreme Court repealed the Government's 2001 decision. In April 2004, in response to an appeal submitted by the Government, the Supreme Court rescinded its February ruling, making the Moldovan Orthodox Church once again the legal successor to the pre-World War II Romanian Orthodox Church. The Metropolis of Bessarabia, which regards itself as the legal and canonical successor to the pre-World War II Romanian Orthodox Church, being endorsed by the ECHR, does not accept this decision. The registration issue has political as well as religious overtones, since it raises the question of whether the Orthodox Church should be oriented toward the Moscow Patriarchate or the Bucharest Patriarchate.

In May 2002, after a long series of registration denials and legal appeals, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the Government must register the Church of the True Orthodox-Moldova, a branch of the [[Russian Orthodox Church Abroad]], which is based in the United States. The State Service on Religious Issues failed to implement the decision in the stipulated 30 days and subsequently asked the Court for a 2-week extension to register the church. But after 3 weeks, instead of registering the church, the Service filed an extraordinary appeal with the Court of Appeals. The Court reviewed the appeal and declared that the Service was not allowed to file the appeal, since the case was made against the Government, not the Service. Within a couple of weeks another appeal from the Prime Minister was filed. In early 2004, the appeal was sent to the Supreme Court and was under examination at the end of the period covered by this report. The Church had submitted applications for registration in 1997, 1998, and 2000; the Government rejected these applications on various grounds.

=== Mormons ===

The Mormons have continuously faced bureaucratic obstacles and have not yet obtained registration. They most recently applied for registration in January (2006?), and the State Service on Religious Issues requested further documentation in March. There has been no further action taken on their registration request, and the Mormons did not report any resistance or pressure from state authorities.

=== Muslims ===

The State Service on Religious Issues has refused registration on numerous occasions to both the Spiritual Organization of Muslims and the Central Muslim Spiritual Board of Moldova (the latter associated with the Central Muslim Spiritual Board of [[Russia]] and [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states). The Spiritual Organization of Muslims has filed a case against the Government for denying it registration with the European Court of Human Rights, and the case is awaiting review. The Central Muslim Spiritual Board of Moldova filed a complaint locally against the State Service on Religious Issues in 2002. The case was heard by the Court of Appeals, which decided in favor of the Muslim group in September 2003 and ordered the Government to register the organization. The Government subsequently appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which returned the case to the Court of Appeals for reexamination. On March 15, 2004, the Court of Appeals began reexamining the case.

The law provides for restitution to politically repressed or exiled persons of property that was confiscated during the successive Nazi and Soviet regimes. In practice this regulation has been extended to religious communities; however, the Moldovan Orthodox Church has been favored over other religious groups. The Church had little difficulty in recovering nearly all of its property and, in cases where property was destroyed, the Government offered alternative compensation. The Church has recovered churches, schools, hospitals, orphanages, and administrative properties. Property disputes among the Moldovan and Bessarabian Churches have not been resolved. The [[Jews in Moldova|Jewish]] community has experienced mixed results in its effort to recover its property; however, by 2004 there were no pending restitution cases for the Jewish community.

=== Situation in Transnistria ===
[[Image:Christmas Church in Tiraspol.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas Church in Tiraspol]]

The [[Transnistria]]n authorities have developed a new textbook that is to be used at all school levels, which reportedly contains negative and defamatory information regarding the Jehovah's Witnesses.

Authorities in Transnistria used registration requirements and other legal mechanisms to restrict the religious freedom of some religious groups. Evangelical religious groups meeting in private homes reportedly have been told that they do not have the correct permits to use their residences as venues for religious services. In the past, they and other non-Orthodox groups generally were not allowed to rent property and often were harassed during religious services.

In 1997, the authorities in Transnistria announced that they would annul the registration of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The Jehovah's Witnesses in Transnistria were originally registered in 1991, and the church was reregistered by the "Ministry of Justice" in 1994 and 1997. However, in 1997 the "President's Commissioner for Religions and Cults" sent official letters to public authorities falsely claiming that the activity of the Jehovah's Witnesses was banned and that their registration was annulled. Using the "President's Commissioner's" deceptive letter, authorities have repeatedly harassed the Jehovah's Witnesses, including halting the distribution of religious literature and refusing to approve a property request to build a house of worship. In 2001, the Jehovah's Witnesses lodged an official complaint with the "President" of Transnistria, and in 2002, they lodged a complaint with the Magistrate in Tiraspol against illegal actions taken by the "President's Commissioner for Religions and Cults." In July 2002, the "President's Commissioner for Religions and Cults" sent a letter to various government departments with instructions to consider the Jehovah's Witnesses as illegal until the case brought against them had been finalized. The Jehovah's Witnesses have lodged an official complaint and a counter lawsuit against the "President's Commissioner for Religions and Cults." Following several hearings, the Court has decided to suspend the trial until the liquidation case has been finalized.In December 2003, the Jehovah's Witnesses were informed that the two trials would be combined into one trial that would be heard by a panel of three judges. The case was being heard at the close of the period covered by this report.

The [[Baptism|Baptist]] community in Transnistria remains unregistered. In previous years, the Baptists in Transnistria complained of increasing harassment from the authorities; however, in 2004 the Baptists reported no direct harassment. In addition authorities did not report threats to destroy the group's church, and the group continued to meet in the same building.

=== Pagan ===
The Kishinev community a "Patrimonial Ring" ("Родовое Кольцо") unites adherents of [[Slavic Neopaganism|Slavic vernacular religion]].

==Abuses of Religious Freedom==

The Spiritual Organization of Muslims has reported regular [[harassment]] by the police. Members say the police often show up at their Friday prayers, which are held at a local Islamic organization's offices, checking participants' documents and taking pictures. On March 5, the police raided their meeting place after Friday prayers, detaining several members and subsequently deporting three Syrian citizens for not having proper legal residence documents. The authorities claimed the religious services were illegal because the organization is not registered, and the place they were meeting was registered to a charity and was not being used for its stated purpose.

In several cases, members of Jehovah's Witnesses reported being detained and fined for preaching their religion. In the village of Cruzesti, the mayor and residents of the village physically blocked members of Jehovah's Witnesses from the public cemetery for not respecting the customs of the Orthodox religion.

The Jehovah's Witnesses in Transnistria have reported several incidents of administrative fines and unjust arrests of their members. In all reported cases, the charges have been dropped in appeals at the level of the Supreme Court.

==Societal Attitudes ==

The generally amicable relations among religions in society contributed to religious freedom. The dispute between the Moldovan and Bessarabian Orthodox Churches is ongoing; however, the adherents of the respective Churches do not interfere with others' freedom to worship.

Jehovah's Witnesses from various regions of the country have complained that their ability to practice their religion freely has been impeded by local town councils and Orthodox priests and adherents. They have also reported physical and verbal abuse by local townspeople at the instigation of local Orthodox priests.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

There were a few reports of negative press articles about non-Orthodox religions. The Jehovah's Witnesses have been the target of articles criticizing their beliefs and legitimacy, and the Baptists in Transnistria claim press reports about their religion have been negative.

Between March 14 and March 30, more than 70 tombstones were desecrated in the Jewish cemetery in Tiraspol. Swastikas and other Nazi symbols were painted on monuments, and many tombstones were damaged beyond repair. On May 4, unknown persons attempted to set the Tiraspol synagogue on fire by throwing a [[Molotov cocktail]] onto the premises near a local gas supply. The attack failed when passers-by extinguished the fire. Transnistrian authorities believe the attacks were propagated by the same people and claim they are investigating the incidents.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Vaishnava calendar'''

'''Gaurabda''' is the name of the moon calendar used by [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] as part of the liturgy.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskcon.com/culture/festival_year/cal_download.html |title=iskcon.com - Culture - International Calendar Download |publisher=www.iskcon.com |accessdate=2008-05-17 |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511200841/http://www.iskcon.com/culture/festival_year/cal_download.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as the main calendar of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Gaudiya Vaisnava]] tradition, the years are counted from the birth (traditionally known as the "appearance" day) of Śrī [[Caitanya Mahaprabhu]]. Lord Caitanya, widely recognized as the incarnation of [[Krishna]], is also known as Gaura, so the year is called "Gaurabda," or "the year of Lord Caitanya."

==Reasons to follow a lunar calendar==

Most scholars who have analyzed the two traditional [[Hindu calendar|Indian calendar]] systems, both lunar and solar, have concluded that the lunar system is the more ancient. The lunar phases are known{{By whom|date=November 2018}} to influence agriculture, and according to scriptures like [[Manu-samhita]] (The laws of Manu), they also influence more subtle aspects of human life. In the Vaisnava calendar the times for various celebrations are determined by the lunar [[tithi]], sometimes with ''[[naksatra]]'' and other elements of the calendar taken into account.

==Traditional and modern methods of calculation==
Traditionally the astronomical calculations needed to make a [[Pancanga]] were done according to an astronomical text such as [[Surya Siddhanta]]. The methods described in Surya Siddhanta are similar to modern astronomical methods for ascertaining the positions of the planets.

The main difference is that Surya Siddhanta has a simpler model. Such a model enables practical manual calculation. Observatory instruments could be built without high technology and were used regularly to check that manual calculations tallied with observable reality. When a difference appeared after some time, corrections were made to the astronomical constants in the formulas. With this system, fairly good results were obtainable even though the astronomical model was simple. Its accuracy cannot be compared to that obtained by modern methods, but for the creation of calendars and for the pseudoscientific purpose of [[astrology]] it sufficed.

Currently a computer program is used to provide formulas that give an accuracy of 1 minute of arc for the longitude of the sun and 2 minutes of arc for the longitude of the moon. When determining ending times of [[tithi]]s, these errors can result in a maximum error of 5 minutes of time. The average error is about 3 minutes. Such an error will report an [[Ekadasi]] (the eleventh tithi) on the wrong date roughly once every 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Names of months===

Each month, or "masa," is known by a name of [[Visnu]].

The months, the [[Sanskrit]] names by which they are commonly known in India, and their rough equivalents according to the [[Gregorian calendar]] are listed as follows:

==Ekadasi==
;When to observe Ekadasi

Ekadasi, the eleventh tithi, has special importance. In the scripture [[Caitanya-caritamrta]], Lord [[Caitanya Mahaprabhu]] instructs [[Sanatana Goswami]] regarding the Vaisnava regulative principles (Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya-lila 24.342):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"You should recommend the avoidance of mixed [viddha] Ekadasi and the performance of pure Ekadasi. You should also describe the fault in not observing this. One should be very careful as far as these items are concerned. If one is not careful, one will be negligent in executing devotional service."

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As described in Hari Bhakti Vilasa, viddha (mixed) Ekadasi takes place when the eleventh tithi starts before sunrise but the tenth tithi still presides at the beginning of brahma muhurta (the auspicious period that starts an hour and a half before sunrise).

On Ekadasi it is traditional to fast. But under certain conditions, called mahadvadasi, one fasts not on the Ekadasi but on the next day, the dvadasi, even though the Ekadasi is suddha,
or pure, and not viddha, or mixed. There are eight mahadvadasis.

The calendars produced by this program make it easy to see when to observe Ekadasi. The Ekadasi fast should be observed on the day called suddha (pure) Ekadasi, or alternatively on
Mahadvadasi, even if the previous day is called Ekadasi. All this is clarified by the asterisk (*), which indicates a fast, at the right margin of the printed computer generated calendar.

"Break fast 05:18 - 09:34" and "Daylight-savings not considered"

To complete the proper observance of [[Ekadasi]], the next morning one should end the fast after the first time given in the calendar and before the second time. The calendar gives these
times according to the standard time of the place for which the calendar is made.

During the summer, many locations do not follow [[standard time]], but instead move their clocks an hour ahead (or sometimes more) to make more use of the hours of daylight.

==Etymology==
''Hamas'' is an [[acronym]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase حركة المقاومة الاسلامية or ''Harakat al-Muqāwama al-Islāmiyya'', meaning "Islamic Resistance Movement". The Arabic word 'hamas' (حماس) means "courage" or "zeal".&lt;ref&gt;Martha Crenshaw, John Pimlott.

Routledge. 2015. p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamas covenant interprets its name to mean "strength and bravery".&lt;ref name="Jefferis"&gt;Jennifer Jefferis.

==Aims==
Hamas, as its name (Islamic Resistance Movement) implies, aims to liberate Palestine from the Israeli occupation by resisting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamas.ps/en/page/2/|title=Hamas Islamic Resistance |website=Hamas.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; And according to Hamas armed branch [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]]:

{{quote|To contribute in the effort of liberating [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and restoring the rights of the [[Palestinian people]] under the sacred Islamic teachings of the [[Holy Quran]], the [[Sunnah]] (traditions) of Prophet [[Muhammad]] ([[Peace be upon him (Islam)|peace and blessings of Allah be upon him]]) and the traditions of Muslims rulers and scholars noted for their piety and dedication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qassam.ps/aboutus.html Al-Qassam Brigades – about us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111223719/http://www.qassam.ps/aboutus.html |date=November 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Al-Qassam Brigades aims to liberate all of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] from what they describe as [[Zionist]] occupation, and to achieve the rights of the Palestinian people that were robbed by the occupation, and it consider itself part of the movement of a project of national liberation.&lt;ref name="about us - alqassam website"&gt;[http://www.alqassam.ps/arabic/#!/%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%86/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership and structure==
[[File:Hamasleadership.png|thumb|Map of key Hamas leadership nodes. 2010]]
[[File:Khaled Meshaal 01.jpg|thumb|Longtime leader, [[Khaled Meshaal]]]]
Hamas inherited from its predecessor a tripartite structure that consisted in the provision of social services, of religious training and military operations under a Shura Council. Traditionally it had four distinct functions: (a) a charitable social welfare division (''dawah''); (b) a military division for procuring weapons and undertaking operations (''al-Mujahideen al Filastinun''); (c) a security service (''Jehaz Aman''); and (d) a media branch (''A'alam'').&lt;ref&gt;Levitt 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA11 pp. 10–11].&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas has both an internal leadership within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and an external leadership, split between a Gaza group directed by [[Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook]] from his exile first in Damascus and then in Egypt, and a Kuwaiti group (''Kuwaidia'') under [[Khaled Mashal]].&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA11 pp. 11–12].&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuwaiti group of Palestinian exiles began to receive extensive funding from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]] after its leader Mashal broke with [[Yasser Arafat]]'s decision to side with [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Invasion of Kuwait]], with Mashal insisting that Iraq withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sara Roy]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=mX1dAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 ''Hamas and Civil Society in Gaza: Engaging the Islamist Social Sector,''] [[Princeton University Press]], Rev.ed. 2013 p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 2017, [[Majlis al-Shura|Hamas' Shura Council]] chose [[Ismail Haniya]] to become the new leader, to replace Mashal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/06/middleeast/hamas-leadership-ismail-haniya/index.html|title=Ismail Haniya elected new Hamas leader|first=Andrew Carey and Joe Sterling|last=CNN|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact nature of the organization is unclear, secrecy being maintained for fear of Israeli assassinations and to conceal operational activities. Formally, Hamas maintains the wings are separate and independent. Matthew Levitt maintains this is a public myth. Davis argues that they are both separate and combined for reasons of internal and external political necessity. Communication between the political and military wings of Hamas is difficult, owing to the thoroughness of Israeli intelligence surveillance and the existence of an extensive base of informants. After the assassination of [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi]] the occasional political direction of the militant wing diminished, with field commanders given discretional autonomy on operations.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 pp. 44–45].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consultative councils===
The governing body is the [[Majlis al-Shura]]. The principle behind the Council is based on the [[Qur'an]]ic concept of consultation and popular assembly (''[[shura]]''), which Hamas leaders argue provides for democracy within an Islamic framework.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hovdenak, 'Hamas in Transition:The Failure of Sanctions,' in Michelle Pace, Peter Seeberg (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RgLcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 ''The European Union's Democratization Agenda in the Mediterranean,''] Routledge, 2013 pp. 50–79 [64].&lt;/ref&gt; As the organization grew more complex and Israeli pressure increased it needed a broader base for decisions, the Shura Council was renamed the 'General Consultative Council', elected from members of local council groups and this in turn elected a 15-member [[Politburo]] (''al-Maktab al-Siyasi'')&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mandaville,[https://books.google.com/books?id=2bvcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA282 ''Islam and Politics,''] Routledge, 2014 Rev.ed, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; that made decisions at the highest level. Representatives come from Gaza, the West Bank, leaders in exile and [[Administrative detention|Israeli prisons]].&lt;ref name="Berti" &gt;Benedetta Berti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EUcDAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 ''Armed Political Organizations: From Conflict to Integration,''] JHU Press, 2013 p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This organ was located in [[Damascus]] until the [[Syrian Civil War]] led it to transfer to [[Qatar]] in January 2012, when Hamas sided with the civil opposition against the regime of [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref name="Berti" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Ayoob, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ph6eAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT47 ''Will the Middle East Implode?,''] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2014 p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social services wing===
Hamas developed its social welfare programme by replicating the model established by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.For them, charity and the development of one's community are prescribed by religion, and, at the same time, are to be understood as forms of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Tristan Dunning,[https://books.google.com/books?id=4jp-CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 p. 136.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic tradition ''dawah'' (lit.'the call to God') obliges the faithful to reach out to others by both proselytising and by charitable works, and typically the latter centre on the mosques which make use of both [[waqf]] endowment resources and charitable donations ([[zakat]]) to fund grassroots services like nurseries, schools, orphanages, soup kitchens, women's activities, library services and even sporting clubs within a larger context of preaching and political discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA16 pp. 16–23].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some 85% of its budget was allocated to the provision of social services.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips [https://books.google.com/books?id=cNq0gvBPcGQC&amp;pg=PA78 p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called perhaps the most significant social services actor in Palestine. By 2000 it or its affiliated charities ran roughly 40% of the social institutions in the West Bank and Gaza and, with other Islamic charities, by 2005 was supporting 120,000 individuals with monthly financial support in Gaza.&lt;ref name = "Shitrit"&gt;Lihi Ben Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zUjuCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71 ''Righteous Transgressions: Women's Activism on the Israeli and Palestinian Religious Right,''] [[Princeton University Press]], 2015 p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the appeal of these institutions is that they fill a vacuum in the administration by the PLO of the Palestinian territories, which had failed to cater to the demand for jobs and broad social services, and is widely viewed as corrupt.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;David L. Phillips,[https://books.google.com/books?id=cNq0gvBPcGQC&amp;pg=PA75 ''From Bullets to Ballots: Violent Muslim Movements in Transition,''] [[Transaction Publishers]], 2011 p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 2005, the budget of Hamas, drawing on global charity contributions, was mostly tied up in covering running expenses for its social programmes, which extended from the supply of housing, food and water for the needy to more general functions like financial aid, medical assistance, educational development and religious instruction. A certain accounting flexibility allowed these funds to cover both charitable causes and military operations, permitting transfer from one to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Davis,[https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 pp. 47ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''dawah'' infrastructure itself was understood, within the Palestinian context, as providing the soil from which a militant opposition to the occupation would flower.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA16 p. 23]: 'In a 1995 lecture, Sheikh Jamil Hamami, a party to the foundation of Hamas and a senior member of its West Bank leadership, expounded the importance of Hamas' dawa infrastructure as the soil from which militancy would flower.'&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard it differs from the rival [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] which lacks any social welfare network, and relies on spectacular terrorist attacks to recruit adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA26 pp. 25–26].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, through funding from Iran, Hamas managed to allocate at a cost of $60 million, monthly stipends of $100 for 100,000 workers, and a similar sum for 3,000 fishermen [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip#Effect on the fishing industry|laid idle by Israel's imposition of restrictions]] on fishing offshore, plus grants totalling $45 million to detainees and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Mohsen Saleh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LGVkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198 ''The Palestinian Strategic Report 2006,''] Al Manhal, 2007 p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Levitt argues that Hamas grants to people are subject to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of how beneficiaries will support Hamas, with those linked to terrorist activities receiving more than others.&lt;ref&gt;James J.F. Forrest, 'Conclusion', in James Dingley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CVJ_AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290 ''Combating Terrorism in Northern Ireland,''] Routledge, 2008 pp. 280–300 [290].&lt;/ref&gt; Israel holds the families of suicide bombers accountable and bulldozes their homes, whereas the families of Hamas activists who have been killed or wounded during militant operations are given an initial, one-time grant varying between $500–$5,000, together with a $100 monthly allowance. Rent assistance is also given to families whose homes have been destroyed by Israeli bombing though families unaffiliated with Hamas are said to receive less.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips [https://books.google.com/books?id=cNq0gvBPcGQC&amp;pg=PA81 p. 81].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, pp. 122–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2007, these activities extended to the West Bank, but, after a PLO crackdown, now continue exclusively in the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48].&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]] deposed the elected Muslim Brotherhood government of [[Mohamed Morsi]] in 2013, Hamas found itself in a financial straitjacket and has since endeavoured to throw the burden of responsibility for public works infrastructure in the Gaza Strip back onto the Palestinian National Authority, but without success.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 pp. 48–49].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military wing===
{{main|Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades}}
The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing was formed in either mid-1991&lt;ref&gt;Aoibhín de Búrca, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LCJHBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 ''Preventing Political Violence Against Civilians: Nationalist Militant Conflict in Northern Ireland, Israel And Palestine,''] Palgrave Macmillan, 2014 pp. 100–02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Najib"&gt;Mohammad Najib and Roland Friedrich 'Non-Statutory Armed Groups and Security Sector Governance,' in Roland Friedrich, Arnold Luethold (eds.),[https://books.google.com/books?id=icV4k__xMmgC&amp;pg=PA106 ''Entry-points to Palestinian Security Sector Reform,''] [[Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces|DCAF]], 2007 pp. 101–27 [103]. This date is based on a Hamas operation that assassinated the rabbi of the Israeli settlement of [[Kfar Darom]] inside the Gaza Strip.&lt;/ref&gt; or 1992, under the direction of [[Yahya Ayyash]], a Hamas field-commander and bomb-maker assassinated by Israel in 1996. It was constituted from units associated with the earlier ''al-Jihad wa Da'wa'', an umbrella group that had gathered in militants from various Islamic resistance cells like the ''Al-Mujahidun al-Filastiniun'' (Palestinian fighters).&lt;ref&gt;Davis,[https://books.google.com/books?id=bmaFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT110 pp. 110–11].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guidère" /&gt; established by [[Salah Shehade]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Najib p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wing takes its name from the prewar [[Palestinian nationalism|militant Palestinian nationalist]] Sheikh [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]], though Hamas cells sometimes refer to themselves as "Students of Ayyash", "Students of the Engineer", or "Yahya Ayyash Units".&lt;ref name = "Guidère" /&gt; At the outset, weapons were hard to come by, and the organization began to resort to intermittent kidnappings of soldiers to secure arms and munitions. This approach had been justified two years earlier when, in the wake of the [[1990 Temple Mount riots|killing of some 20 Palestinians were killed]] by Israeli forces dispersing protestors at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in 1990, Hamas had declared every Israeli soldier a legitimate target.&lt;ref name="Engeland"&gt;Alincée Van Engeland,'Hamas,' in Jeffrey Ian Ross (ed.)[https://books.google.com/books?id=MFfrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA319 ''Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present,''] Routledge 2015 pp. 319–23 [319].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Weapons Found in a Mosque During Cast Lead (2).jpg|thumb|Weapons found in a mosque during [[Operation Cast Lead]], according to the IDF]]
Ayyash, with a degree in electrical engineering, quickly improved Hamas's strike capacity by developing [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] and promoting the tactic of suicide bombings.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bmaFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT110 p. 111].&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Hamas's laboratories had devised a primitive form of rocketry, the Qassam 1, which they first launched in October 2000, carrying a 500 gram warhead with a throw range of 4 kilometres. Both propellant and the explosive were manufactured from chemical fertilizers, though TNT was also tried.&lt;ref&gt;Mohannad Sabry,[https://books.google.com/books?id=ydHRCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 ''Sinai: Egypt's Linchpin, Gaza's Lifeline, Israel's Nightmare''], British Academic Press, 2015, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next five years of the conflict, a 3-kilogram-warhead-armed version with a strike range of 6–8 kilometres, the Qassam 2, was also produced&lt;ref&gt;Najib p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and in an incremental rise, these rocket types were fired towards Israeli settlements along the Gaza Strip: 4 in 2001, 35 in 2002, 155 in 2003, 281 in 2004, and 179 in 2005. By 2005, the Qassam 3 had been engineered with a 12–14 kilometre range and a 15 kilo warhead. By 2006, 942 such rockets were launched into southern Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Sabry p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|War with Israel in 2008–2009]], Hamas deployed [[BM-21 Grad|122-mm Grad rocketry]] with a 20–40 kilometre range and a 30 kilogram warhead and a variety of guided [[9M133 Kornet|Kornet]] antitank missiles.&lt;ref&gt;Sabry, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ydHRCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 Hamas had engineered a version of the [[Fajr-5]] rocket, which was capable of reaching as far as [[Tel Aviv]], as was shown after the assassination of [[Ahmed Jabari]] in that year. In the 2014 war its advanced rocketry reached Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;Jefferis,[https://books.google.com/books?id=rzRpCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 p. 119].&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas deployed its increasingly sophisticated{{dubious|date=March 2017}} rocketry to replace its martyrdom operations.&lt;ref name="Najib p. 107"&gt;Najib p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of members is known only to the Brigades leadership, Israel estimates the Brigades have a core of several hundred members who receive [[Military training|military style training]], including training in Iran and in [[Syria]] (before the Syrian Civil War).&lt;ref name = "Guidère" &gt;Mathieu Guidère, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tCvhzGiDMYsC&amp;pg=PA173 ''Historical Dictionary of Islamic Fundamentalism,''] [[Scarecrow Press]], 2012 p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the brigades have an estimated 10,000–17,000 operatives,&lt;ref&gt;Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zUjuCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71 p. 71].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Najib p. 106"&gt;Najib p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; forming a backup force whenever circumstances call for reinforcements for the Brigade. Recruitment training lasts for two years.&lt;ref name = "Guidère" /&gt;

The group's ideology outlines its aim as the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of Palestinian rights under the dispensations set forth in the Qur'an, and this translates into three policy priorities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To evoke the spirit of Jihad (Resistance) among Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims; to defend Palestinians and their land against the Zionist occupation and its manifestations; to liberate Palestinians and their land that was usurped by the Zionist occupation forces and settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Najib p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to its official stipulations, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades' military operations are to be restricted to operating only inside Palestine, engaging with Israeli soldiers, and in exercising the right of self-defense against armed settlers. They are to avoid civilian targets, to respect the enemy's humanity by refraining from mutilation, defacement or excessive killing, and to avoid targeting Westerners either in the occupied zones or beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Najib pp. 105–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, Hamas altered its approach restricting actions to 'legitimate military targets' by extended them to Israeli civilians after 7 years.&lt;ref name="Najib p. 106"/&gt; Though between 1996 and 2001 it generally refrained from targeting Israeli civilians,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Najib p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; it adopted [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|sporadic suicide bombings]] in the wake of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]], when an Israeli settler in military fatigues, [[Baruch Goldstein]], shot dead 29 Muslims at prayer in 1993.&lt;ref name="Cragin" &gt;R.Kim Cragin,'Learning to Survive:The Case of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)', in James JF Forrest (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1R79AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199 ''Teaching Terror: Strategic and Tactical Learning in the Terrorist World,''] [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 2006 pp. 189–204 [196].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erlich Reese, [[Robert Baer]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=2gZZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 ''Conversations with Terrorists: Middle East Leaders on Politics, Violence, and Empire,''] Routledge, 2016 p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4jp-CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 p. 34].&lt;/ref&gt; After the Al Aqsa revolt, the Brigades were behind most of the suicide bombings in Israel, a measure it defended as a form of "reciprocity".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Down to 2007, the Brigades are estimated to have lost some 800 operatives in conflicts with Israeli forces. The leadership has been consistently undermined by targeted assassinations. Aside from [[Yahya Ayyash]] (5 January 1996), it has lost [[Emad Akel]] (24 November 1993) [[Salah Shehade]], (23 July 2002), [[Ibrahim al-Makadmeh]], (8 March 2003) [[Ismail Abu Shanab]], (21 August 2003) [[Ahmed Yassin]] (March 22, 2004) and [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi]],( April 17, 2004).,&lt;ref name="Jefferis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Najib p. 107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Harry Raymond Hueston, Paul G. Pierpaoli Jr., Sherifa Zahar, 'Hamas' in Priscilla Roberts (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=xveCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67 ''Arab-Israeli Conflict: The Essential Reference Guide,''] [[ABC-CLIO]], 2014 p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

After Israel arrested hundreds of its members in May 1989, Hamas regionalized its command system to make its operative structure more diffuse,&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt; and minimize the chances of being detected.&lt;ref name="Gunning"&gt;Jeroen Gunning, 'Hamas:Harakat al-Muqamama al-Islamiyya,' in Marianne Heiberg, Brendan O'Leary, John Tirman (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=m8_pM7Ncij8C&amp;pg=PA134 ''Terror, Insurgency, and the State: Ending Protracted Conflicts,''] [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 2007 pp. 123–55 [134].&lt;/ref&gt; The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades groups its fighters in 4–5 man cells, which in turn are integrated into companies and battalions. Unlike the political section, which is split between an internal and external structure, the Brigades are under a local Palestinian leadership, and disobedience with the decisions taken by the political leadership have been relatively rare.&lt;ref&gt;Najib pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades are an integral part of Hamas, the exact nature of the relationship is hotly debated. They appear to operate at times independently of Hamas, exercising a certain autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joyce |last=Davis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxwbNesHJBkC&amp;pg=PA100 |title=Martyrs: Innocence, Vengeance, and Despair in the Middle East|publisher= [[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year= 2004 |page= 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herrick"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mandaville, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bvcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA282 p. 282].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitt 2008"&gt;Matthew Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F5EmiYXQUcsC&amp;pg=PA89 ''Negotiating Under Fire: Preserving Peace Talks in the Face of Terror Attacks,''] [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] 2008 pp. 89ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L.Esposito, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SlhxoTHLxeMC&amp;pg=PA231 ''Islam and Violence,''] [[Syracuse University Press]] 1998 p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cells have independent links with the external leadership, enabling them to bypass the hierarchical command chain and political leadership in Gaza.&lt;ref name="Gunning"/&gt; Ilana Kass and Bard O'Neill, likening Hamas's relationship with the Brigades to the political party [[Sinn Féin]]'s relationship to the military arm of the [[Irish Republican Army]]. quote a senior Hamas official as stating: "The Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigade is a separate armed military wing, which has its own leaders who do not take their orders from Hamas and do not tell us of their plans in advance."&lt;ref name="Kass"&gt;Ilana Kass &amp; Bard E.

If we do so, the body will not be able to fly. Hamas is one body."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Levitt [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA34 p. 34].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances and funding==
At the 1993 Philadelphia conference, Hamas leaders' statements indicated that they read [[George H. W. Bush]]'s outline of a [[New world order (politics)|New World Order]] as embodying a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|tacit aim]] to destroy Islam, and that therefore funding should focus on enhancing the Islamic roots of Palestinian society and promoting jihad in the occupying territories.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas's budget, calculated to be roughly US$70 million (2011), is derived in large part (85%)&lt;ref name="Vittori"/&gt; from foreign, rather than internal Palestinian, sources. Only two Israeli-Palestinian sources figure in a list seized in 2004, while the other contributors were donor bodies located in Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Britain, Germany, the United States, United Arab Emirates, Italy and France. Much of the money raised comes from sources that direct their assistance to what Hamas describes as its charitable work for Palestinians, but investments in support of its ideological position are also relevant, with Persian Gulf States and Saudi Arabia prominent in the latter. Matthew Levitt states that Hamas also taps money from corporations, criminal organizations and financial networks that support terror,&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA143 pp. 143–44].&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to engage in cigarette and drug smuggling, multimedia copyright infringement and credit card fraud.&lt;ref name="Vittori"/&gt; Vittori states that, more than other similar organizations, it is particularly careful about keeping resources for its militant, political and public works activities separate.&lt;ref name="Vittori"/&gt; The United States, Israel and the EU have shut down many charities and organs that channel money to Hamas, such as the Holy Land Foundation for Relief.&lt;ref&gt;Colin P. Clarke, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJRzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 ''Terrorism, Inc.: The Financing of Terrorism, Insurgency, and Irregular Warfare: The Financing of Terrorism, Insurgency, and Irregular Warfare''], ABC-CLIO, 2015 p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1992 and 2001 this group is said to have provided $6.8 million to Palestinian charities of the $57 million collected. By 2001 it was alleged to have given Hamas $13 million, and was shut down shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Interpal and Development and the Al-Aqsa Charitable Foundation Fund. pp.&amp;nbsp;146, 154–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of Hamas's funding came from states in the Persian Gulf down to the mid 2000s. Saudi Arabia supplied half of the Hamas budget of $50 million in the early 2000s,&lt;ref name="Burfeindt"&gt;Marsh E. Burfeindt, 'Rapprochement with Iran', in Thomas A. Johnson (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tu5m8_0iUSoC&amp;pg=PA198 ''Power, National Security, and Transformational Global Events: Challenges Confronting America, China, and Iran'']. CRC Press. 2012. pp. 185–235 [198].&lt;/ref&gt; but, under U.S. pressure, began cut its funding by cracking down on Islamic charities and private donor transfers to Hamas in 2004,&lt;ref name="Vittori"&gt;Jodi Vittori, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ra_GAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193 ''Terrorist Financing and Resourcing,''] Palgrave Macmillan, 2011 pp. 72–74, 193 notes 50, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; which by 2006 drastically reduced the flow of money from that area. Iran and Syria, in the aftermath of Hamas's 2006 electoral victory, stepped in to fill the shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joshua L. Gleis, Benedetta Berti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PIHmSazFx_0C&amp;pg=PA156 ''Hezbollah and Hamas: A Comparative Study,''] [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2012 p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi funding, negotiated with third parties like Egypt, remained supportive of Hamas as a Sunni group but chose to provide more assistance to the PNA, the electoral loser, when the EU responded to the outcome by suspending its monetary aid.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mason, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaIcBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 ''Foreign Policy in Iran and Saudi Arabia: Economics and Diplomacy in the Middle East,''] [[I.B. Tauris]], 2015 pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; Iran in the 1980s began by providing 10% of Hamas's funding, which it increased annually until by the 1990s it supplied $30 million.&lt;ref name =Burfeindt/&gt; It accounted for $22 million, over a quarter of Hamas's budget, by the late 2000s.&lt;ref name="Vittori"/&gt; According to Matthew Levitt, Iran preferred direct financing to operative groups rather than charities, requiring video proof of attacks.&lt;ref name =Vittori/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, pp. 172–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Iran funding is said to be channeled through [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name="Vittori"/&gt;
After 2006 Iran's willingness to take over the burden of the shortfall created by the drying up of Saudi funding also reflected the geopolitical tensions between the two, since, though Shiite, Iran was supporting a Sunni group traditionally closely linked with the Saudi kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Rubin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TzeOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 ''Islam in the Balance: Ideational Threats in Arab Politics'']. Stanford University Press, 2014 p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The US imposed sanctions on Iran's Bank Saderat, alleging it had funneled hundreds of millions to Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;Jalil Roshandel, Alethia H. Cook, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0c_IAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 ''The United States and Iran: Policy Challenges and Opportunities,''] Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The US has expressed concerns that Hamas obtains funds through Palestinian and Lebanese sympathizers of Arab descent in the [[Foz do Iguaçu]] area of the tri-border region of [[Latin America]], an area long associated with arms trading, drug trafficking, contraband, the manufacture of counterfeit goods, money-laundering and currency fraud. The State Department adds that confirmatory information of a Hamas operational presence there is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Mark P. Sullivan, [https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/128377.pdf 'Latin America: Terrorism Issues']. Congressional Research Service. 14 July 2009. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2009, [[sanctions on Iran]] made funding difficult, forcing Hamas to rely on religious donations by individuals in the West Bank, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Funds amounting to tens of millions of dollars raised in the Gulf states were transferred through the [[Rafah Border Crossing]]. These were not sufficient to cover the costs of governing the Strip and running the al Qassam Brigades, and when tensions arose with Iran over support of President Assad in Syria, Iran dropped its financial assistance to the government, restricting its funding to the military wing, which meant a drop from $150 million in 2012 to $60 million the following year. A further drop occurred in 2015 when Hamas expressed its criticisms of Iran's role in the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemeni Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA173 p. 173].&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Hamas was created essentially because the Islamicists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood feared that without their direct participation in the first Intifada, they would lose supporters to both the PIJ and the PLO, the latter of which was anxious to reassert itself in the Palestinian territories after being marginalized following its expulsion from Lebanon. As authors Mishal and Saela, explain, "The Mujamma's decision to adopt a 'jihad now' policy against 'enemies of Allah' (through the creation of Hamas) was thus largely a matter of survival.'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamas Charter (1988)===
{{main|Hamas Covenant}}
The foundational document, the [[Hamas Charter]] (''mīthāq ḥarakat''), is dated 18 August 1988, and contains both [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] passages, characterizations of Israeli society as Nazi-like in its cruelty,&lt;ref&gt;Ronni Shaked, 'Ethos of Conflict of the Palestinian Society,' in Keren Sharvit, Eran Halperin (eds.)

The author of the Charter was one of the 'old guard' of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Gaza Strip, completely cut off from the outside world. All kinds of confusions and conflations between Judaism and Zionism found their way into the Charter, to the disservice of Hamas ever since, as this document has managed to brand it with charges of 'anti-Semitism' and a naïve world-view' Hamas leaders and spokespeople have rarely referred to the Charter or quoted from it, evidence that it has come to be seen as a burden rather than an intellectual platform that embraces the movement's principles.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Khaled Hroub]], 'A "New Hamas" through its new documents', [[Journal of Palestine Studies]], vol. 35, No. 4, Summer 2006, Issue 140, pp. 6–28 [6] cited Michael Schulz, 'Hamas Between Sharia Rule and Demo-Islam,' in Ashok Swain, Ramses Amer, Joakim Öjendal (eds.),[https://books.google.com/books?id=cTXekQIjsLgC&amp;pg=PA202 ''Globalization and Challenges to Building Peace,''] pp. 195–201: 'Hamas continues to be characterized with reference to its 1988 charter drawn up less than a year after the movement was established in direct response to the outbreak of the third intifada and when its raison d'être was armed resistance to the occupation.

Decades down the line, Hamas's official position changed with regard to a two-state solution.

[[Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook|Mousa Marzook]] said in 2007 that the charter could not be altered because it would look like a compromise not acceptable to the 'street' and risk fracturing the party's unity. Hamas leader [[Khaled Meshaal]] has stated that the Charter is "a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons".[[Ahmed Yousef]], senior adviser to [[Ismail Haniyeh]], added in 2011 that it reflected the views of the Elders in the face of a 'relentless occupation.' The details of its religious and political language had not been examined within the framework of international law, and an internal committee review to amend it was shelved out of concern not to offer concessions to Israel, as had Fatah, on a silver platter.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41]&lt;/ref&gt; While Hamas representatives recognize the problem, one official notes that Arafat got very little in return for changing the PLO Charter under the Oslo Accords, and that there is agreement that little is gained from a non-violent approach.&lt;ref name="Duss" &gt;Matthew Duss, [http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/190832/remember-gaza 'Remember Gaza?,]' [[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet Magazine]] 8 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Davis says the dismissal by contemporary leaders of its relevance and yet the suspension of a desire to rewrite it reflects the differing constituencies Hamas must address, the domestic audience and international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41].&lt;/ref&gt; The charter itself is considered an 'historical relic.'&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Pearlman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Rn3CgDAymEC&amp;pg=PA137 ''Violence, Nonviolence, and the Palestinian National Movement''], Cambridge University Press, 2011 p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Hamas released its official legislative program. The document clearly signaled that Hamas could refer the issue of recognizing Israel to a national referendum. Under the heading "Recognition of Israel," it stated simply (AFP, 3/11/06): "The question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people." This was a major shift away from their 1988 charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2974|title=Nixed Signals|author=Seth Ackerman|date=September–October 2006|work=Extra!|publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, via [[University of Maryland]]'s Jerome Segal, the group sent a letter to U.S. President [[George W.

In an April 2008 meeting between Hamas leader [[Khaled Mashal]] and former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], an understanding was reached in which Hamas agreed it would respect the creation of a Palestinian state in the territory seized by Israel in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], provided this were ratified by the Palestinian people in a referendum.

In February 2012, according to the Palestinian authority, Hamas forswore the use of violence.

Israel has rejected some truce offers by Hamas because it contends the group uses them to prepare for more fighting rather than peace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/25/israelandthepalestinians Israel rejects Gaza ceasefire] ''The Guardian'' (UK), April 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine columnist [[Jeffrey Goldberg]], along with other analysts, believes Hamas may be incapable of permanent reconciliation with Israel.&lt;ref name="Hamas's Insults"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/01/nizar_rayyan_of_hamas_on_gods.php "Nizar Rayyan of Hamas on God's Hatred of Jews"], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', (January 2, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mkhaimer Abusada]], a political scientist at [[Al Azhar University]], writes that Hamas talks "of hudna [temporary ceasefire], not of peace or reconciliation with Israel.

===1990s===
Hamas carried out its first attack against Israel in 1989, abducting and killing two soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces immediately arrested Yassin and sentenced him to life in prison, and deported 400 Hamas activists, including Zahar, to [[South Lebanon]], which at the time was occupied by Israel. During this time Hamas built a relationship with [[Hezbollah]].
Hamas's military branch, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was created in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZPQm5cQ4AwC&amp;dq=Mehola+Junction+bombing+islamic+jihad&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Martyrdom, Not Suicide: The Legality of Hamas' Bombings in the Mid-1990s in Modern Islamic Jurisprudence] By M.A. Philipp Holtmann, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s the al-Qassam Brigades conducted numerous attacks on Israel, with both civilian and military victims.

===Second Intifada===

[[File:Autobus v Haifě.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of a bus bombing in Haifa in 2003.]]
Al-Qassam Brigades militants were among the armed groups that launched both military-style attacks and suicide bombings against Israeli civilian and military targets during the [[Second Intifada]] (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada ({{lang-ar|انتفاضة الأقصى}}, ''Intifā{{transl|ar|DIN|ḍ}}at El Aq{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣ}}a''; {{lang-he|אינתיפאדת אל-אקצה}}, ''Intifādat El-Aqtzah''), which began in late September 2000. This [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories was much more violent than the [[First Intifada]]. The military and civilian death toll is estimated at 5500 Palestinians and more than 1100 Israelis, as well as 64 foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp ''B'Tselem&amp;nbsp;– Statistics&amp;nbsp;– Fatalities''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105120054/http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp |date=January 5, 2010 }}, [[B'Tselem]].&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study of Palestinian suicide bombings during the [[second intifada]] (September 2000 through August 2005) found that about 40 percent were carried out by the al-Qassam Brigades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/benmelech/files/JEP_0807.pdf "Human Capital and the Productivity of Suicide Bombers"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127151257/http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/benmelech/files/JEP_0807.pdf |date=January 27, 2013}} ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'' Volume 21, Number 3, Summer 2007. pp. 223–38&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate trigger for the uprising is disputed, but a more general cause, writes U.S. political science professor Jeremy Pressman, was "popular Palestinian discontent [that] grew during the Oslo peace process because the reality on the ground did not match the expectations created by the peace agreements".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCS/Fall03/pressman.pdf "The Second Intifada: Background and Causes of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict"] Jeremy Pressman, Fall 2003 (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas would be the beneficiary of this growing discontent in the 2006 Palestinian Authority legislative elections.

In January 2004, Hamas leader Sheikh [[Ahmed Yassin]] said that the group would end armed resistance against Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state in the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], and [[east Jerusalem]], and that restoring Palestinians' "historical rights" (relating to the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]]) "would be left for future generations".&lt;ref name="Running out of time"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/675/re1.htm Running out of time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120061025/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/675/re1.htm |date=January 20, 2010}} ''Al-Ahram Weekly'' January 29&amp;nbsp;– February 4, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25, 2004, senior Hamas official [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] offered a 10-year truce, or ''[[hudna]]'', in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the complete withdrawal by Israel from the [[Green Line (Israel)|territories captured]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name="Running out of time"/&gt; Al-Rantissi stated that Hamas had come to the conclusion that it was "difficult to liberate all our land at this stage, so we accept a phased liberation".&lt;ref name="Running out of time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-rejects-insincere-hamas-offer-of-10year-truce-574542.html "Israel rejects 'insincere' Hamas offer of 10-year truce"] ''The Independent'' January 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Israel immediately dismissed al-Rantissi's statements as insincere and a smokescreen for military preparations.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; Yassin was assassinated on March 22, 2004, by a [[targeted Israeli air strike]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3636207.stm Fury as Gaza buries Hamas leader] BBC News April 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and al-Rantisi was assassinated by a similar air strike on April 18, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3556099.stm Hamas chief killed in air strike] BBC News March 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 presidential and legislative elections===
While Hamas boycotted the [[Palestinian presidential election, 2005|2005 Palestinian presidential election]], it did participate in the [[Palestinian municipal election, 2005|2005 municipal elections]] organized by Yasser Arafat in the occupied territories. In those elections it won control of over one third of Palestinian municipal councils, besting [[Fatah]], which had for long been the biggest force in Palestinian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas success in Fatah heartland|publisher=BBC News|date=May 13, 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4541383.stm|accessdate=January 5, 2010|first=Matthew|last=Price}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its election manifesto for the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 Palestinian legislative election]], Hamas omitted a call for an end to Israel, though it did still call for armed struggle against the occupation.&lt;ref name="guard1"&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 12, 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1684472,00.html|title=Hamas drops call for destruction of Israel from manifesto|location=London|first=Chris|last=McGreal|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ynetnews-40yearslater"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas: Ceasefire for return to 1967 border|publisher=Ynetnews|date=January 30, 2006|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3207845,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas won the 2006 elections, winning 76 of the 132 seats to Fatah's 43.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/27/international/middleeast/27mideast.html Hamas Routs Ruling Faction, Casting Pall on Peace Process], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Seen by many as primarily a rejection of the Fatah government's corruption and ineffectiveness, the Hamas victory seemingly had brought to an end 40 years of PLO domination of Palestinian politics.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Ess.

Following its electoral victory, Hamas assumed the administration of the Gaza strip and introduced radical changes. Writing in [[Foreign Affairs]], [[Daniel Byman]] stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;After it took over the Gaza Strip Hamas revamped the police and security forces, cutting them 50,000 members (on paper, at least) under Fatah to smaller, efficient forces of just over 10,000, which then cracked down on crime and gangs. No longer did groups openly carry weapons or steal with impunity. People paid their taxes and electric bills, and in return authorities picked up garbage and put criminals in jail. Gaza-neglected under Egyptian and then Israeli control, and misgoverned by Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and his successors-finally has a real government.' &lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Byman]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20788644 'How to Handle Hamas: The Perils of Ignoring Gaza's Leadership,]' [[Foreign Affairs]], Vol. 89, No. 5 (September/October 2010), pp. 45–62 [52].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early February 2006, Hamas offered Israel a 10-year truce "in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories: the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem,"&lt;ref name="BBC-Hamas-who"/&gt; and recognition of Palestinian rights including the "right of return".&lt;ref name="ynetnews1"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3223438,00.html Peace with Israel for withdrawal to '67 borders], Ynetnews March 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Mashal added that Hamas was not calling for a final end to armed operations against Israel, and it would not impede other Palestinian groups from carrying out such operations.&lt;ref name="telegraph-2006"&gt;{{cite news|date=February 9, 2006|title=Hamas offers deal if Israel pulls out|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1510074/Hamas-offers-deal-if-Israel-pulls-out.html|location=London|first=Tim|last=Butcher|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, the [[Quartet on the Middle East]] (the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU), and the United Nations) stated that assistance to the Palestinian Authority would only continue if Hamas renounced violence, recognized Israel, and accepted previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements, which Hamas refused to do.&lt;ref name="Pike"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hamas.htm|title=Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement)|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quartet then imposed a freeze on all international aid to the Palestinian territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6469217.stm Palestinian sanctions to remain] BBC, March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 after the Gaza election, Hamas leader sent a letter addressed to George W.

# The Palestinian people, wherever they reside, constitute a single and united people and form an integral part of the Arab and Muslim nation ... [Quranic verse]. Our Palestinian people are still living a phase of national liberation, and thus they have the right to strive to recover their own rights and end the occupation using all means, including armed struggle. We have to make all our resources available to support our people and defeat the occupation and establish a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.

===2014 Israel–Gaza conflict===
{{main|2014 Israel–Gaza conflict}}
On 8 July 2014 Israel launched [[Operation Protective Edge]] to counter increased Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. The conflict ended with a permanent cease-fire after 7 weeks, and more than 2,200 dead. 64 of the dead were Israeli soldiers, 7 were civilians in Israel (from rocket attacks), and 2,101 were killed in Gaza, of which according to [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|UN OCHA]] at least 1,460 were civilians. Israel says 1,000 of the dead were militants. Following the conflict, [[Mahmoud Abbas]] president of the Palestinian Authority, accused Hamas of needlessly extending the fighting in the Gaza Strip, contributing to the high death toll, of running a "shadow government" in Gaza, and of illegally executing scores of Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/gaza-strip-palestinian-leader-assails-hamas-calling-unity-pact-into-question.html?_r=0 Palestinian Leader Assails Hamas, Calling Unity Pact Into Question].

===Reconciliation attempts===
In 2016, Hamas began security co-ordination with Egypt to crack down on Islamic terrorist organizations in Sinai, in return for economic aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/08/israel-egypt-hamas-cooperation-security-islamic-state-sinai.html|title=Israel, Hamas, Egypt indirectly cooperating against IS|first=|last=spollatschek|date=August 18, 2017|website=Al-Monitor.com|access-date=January 6, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024100456/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/08/israel-egypt-hamas-cooperation-security-islamic-state-sinai.html|archivedate=October 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Hamas unveiled its new charter, in an attempt to moderate its image. The charter no longer calls for Israel's destruction, but still calls for liberation of Palestine and to 'confront the Zionist project'. It also confirms acceptance of the 1967 borders as the basis for establishing a Palestinian state as well as not being an offshoot of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-charter-1637794876|title=Hamas in 2017: The document in full|website=MiddleEastEye.net|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/whats-behind-hamas-new-charter|title=What's behind Hamas' new charter?|first=Ali|last=Abunimah|date=May 2, 2017|website=ElectronicIntifada.net|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Fatah and Hamas signed yet another reconciliation agreement. The partial agreement addresses civil and administrative matters involving Gaza and the West Bank. Other contentious issues such as national elections, reform of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and possible demilitarization of Hamas were to be discussed in the next meeting in November 2017, due to a new step-by-step approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/hamas-fatah-reconciliation-deal-succeed-171013064803703.html|title=Will Hamas-Fatah reconciliation deal succeed?|first=Jonathan|last=Cook|website=www.AlJazeera.com|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
In 2005, Hamas announced its intention to launch an experimental TV channel, [[Al-Aqsa TV]]. The station was launched on January 7, 2006, less than three weeks before the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian legislative elections]]. It has shown television programs, including some children's television, which deliver anti-semitic messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Semitic Hate Speech in the Name of Islam|date=May 16, 2008|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,553724,00.html|publisher=Spiegel Online International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas has stated that the television station is "an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement," and that Hamas does not hold anti-semitic views.&lt;ref name="Hamas Condemns the Holocaust"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/12/hamascondemnstheholocaust Hamas Condemns the Holocaust] ''The Guardian'' May 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas produced several propaganda songs aimed to scare Israeli citizen including [[Shock Israel's Security]] and "Go, call a Gazan to rip [[Givati Brigade|Giv'ati]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New propaganda song from Hamas|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/captain/viral/1.2483212|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's magazine===

{{main|Al-Fateh}}
''Al-Fateh'' ("the conqueror") is the Hamas children's magazine, published biweekly in London, and also posted in an online website. It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid-September 2007. The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles, and states it is for "the young builders of the future".&lt;ref name="OnlineTerrorists"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalpolitician.com/24252-terror |title=Online Terrorists Prey on the Vulnerable |publisher=Globalpolitician.com |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720001052/http://globalpolitician.com/24252-terror |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[MEMRI]] (three of whose seven founding staff had formerly served in the IDF), the magazine includes incitement to jihad and martyrdom and glorification of terrorist operations and of their planners and perpetrators. as well as characterizations of Jews as "murderers of the prophets" and laudatory descriptions of parents who encourage their sons to kill Jews. In each issue, a regular feature titled "The Story of a Martyr" presents the "heroic deeds" of a [[mujahid]] from one of the organizations who died in a suicide operation, including operations against civilians, or who was killed by the IDF. MEMRI also noted that the magazine includes illustrations of figures, including child warriors, who embody the ethos of jihad and martyrdom, presenting them as role models. These include the magazine's titular character, Al-Fateh ("The Conqueror")&amp;nbsp;– a small boy on a horse brandishing a drawn scimitar&amp;nbsp;– as well as children carrying guns, and photos of Hamas fighters launching Qassam rockets.&lt;ref name="memri.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=ia&amp;ID=IA39307 |title=Hamas Children's Magazine Al-Fateh Encourages Terrorism, Glorifies Martyrdom |publisher=Memri.org |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805080903/http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=ia&amp;ID=IA39307 |archivedate=August 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/al_fateh_hamas.htm |title=Hamas Magazine for Kids Promotes Martyrdom and Hatred |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804222805/http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/al_fateh_hamas.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamization efforts==

===In the Gaza Strip===
{{Main|Islamization of the Gaza Strip}}
The gender ideology outlined in the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted, while defining that role as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing. This is not so different from Fatah's view of women in the First Intifada and it also resembles the outlook of Jewish settlers, and over time it has been subjected to change.&lt;ref&gt;Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zUjuCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 pp. 73–74].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cNq0gvBPcGQC&amp;pg=PA81 p. 81].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, during the First Intifada, a small number of Hamas followers&lt;ref&gt;Shitrit p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; campaigned for the wearing of the [[hijab]], which is not a part of traditional women's attire in Palestine,&lt;ref&gt;Gerber p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; for polygamy, and also insisted women stay at home and be segregated from men. In the course of this campaign, women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed, with the result that the hijab was being worn 'just to avoid problems on the streets'.&lt;ref name="Ruben"&gt;[[Cheryl Rubenberg]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=_ggmzWG8qfsC&amp;pg=PA231 ''Palestinian Women: Patriarchy and Resistance in the West Bank''], Lynne Reinner 2001 pp. 230–31&lt;/ref&gt; The harassment dropped drastically when, after 18 months [[Unified National Leadership of the Uprising|UNLU]] condemned it,&lt;ref&gt;Deborah J. Gerner, 'Mobilizing Women for Nationalist Agendas,' in Valentine M.

Since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, some of its members have attempted to impose Islamic dress or the [[hijab]] head covering on women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/world/middleeast/06gaza.html Hamas Fights Over Gaza's Islamist Identity] ''The New York Times'', September 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xinhua"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |title=Hamas encourages Gaza women to follow Islamic code _English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=January 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514030330/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the government's "Islamic Endowment Ministry" has deployed Virtue Committee members to warn citizens of the dangers of immodest dress, card playing, and dating.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aB2RfynNbLmk Hamas Bans Women Dancers, Scooter Riders in Gaza Push] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118123632/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aB2RfynNbLmk |date=November 18, 2015 }} By Daniel Williams, Bloomberg, November 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no government laws imposing dress and other moral standards, and the Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; There has also been successful resistance to attempts by local Hamas officials to impose Islamic dress on women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/18/hamas-gaza-islamist-dress-code Hamas patrols beaches in Gaza to enforce conservative dress code] ''The Guardian'' (UK), October 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas officials deny having any plans to impose Islamic law, one legislator stating that "What you are seeing are incidents, not policy," and that Islamic law is the desired standard "but we believe in persuasion".&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; The Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; When the BBC in 2010 interviewed five "middle-class" women in [[Gaza City]], the subjects generally indicated Hamas attempts to enforce conservative religious standards of dress had been largely rejected by the local population, with some expressing concern that the closure of Gaza would allow the proliferation of extremist enforcement attempts by low-level Hamas officials, and others indicating they were happy to see Hamas enforcing such requirements. They also cited examples of leniency by Hamas authorities, such as allowing widowed women to keep custody of their children so long as they did not remarry, and other relaxations in the enforcement of Shariah law. One woman noted that the environment was "not as bad" as during the First Intifada, when women were subject to public criticism and stonings for failure to obey conservative Islamic standards of dress. One woman complained that women were not free to speak their minds or travel alone, and added: "Hamas want to force themselves onto the people. They want the people to submit to them, this is their cover. They destroyed the reputation of Islam, by saying we're doing this because it is religion. This is how they won the elections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8557251.stm |title=Women in Gaza: Life Under Hamas |publisher=BBC News |date=March 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the West Bank===
In 2005, the human rights organization [[Freemuse]] released a report titled "Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music", which said that [[Music of Palestine|Palestinian musicians]] feared that harsh religious laws against music and concerts will be imposed since Hamas group scored political gains in the Palestinian Authority local elections of 2005.&lt;ref name="freemuse"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freemuse.org/sw10095.asp |title=Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music |publisher=Freemuse.org |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807211707/http://www.freemuse.org/sw10095.asp |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt by Hamas to dictate a cultural code of conduct in the 1980s and early 1990s led to a violent fighting between different Palestinian sectors. Hamas members reportedly burned down stores that stocked videos they deemed indecent and destroyed books they described as "heretical".&lt;ref name="barel"/&gt;

In 2005, an outdoor music and dance performance in [[Qalqiliya]] were suddenly banned by the Hamas led municipality, for the reason that such an event would be forbidden by Islam, or "[[Haram]]".&lt;ref name="otterbeck"&gt;"Battling over the public sphere: Islamic reactions to the music of today". Jonas Otterbeck. ''Contemporary Islam''. Volume 2, Number 3, 211–28, {{doi|10.1007/s11562-008-0062-y}}. "... the over-all argument was that the event was haram"&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality also ordered that music no longer be played in the Qalqiliya zoo, and mufti Akrameh Sabri issued a [[fatwa|religious edict]] affirming the municipality decision.&lt;ref name="barel"/&gt; In response, the Palestinian national poet [[Mahmoud Darwish]] warned that "There are Taliban-type elements in our society, and this is a very dangerous sign."&lt;ref name="freemuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="darwish"&gt;"Palestinians Debate Whether Future State Will be Theocracy or Democracy".

The Palestinian columnist Mohammed Abd Al-Hamid, a resident of Ramallah, wrote that this religious coercion could cause the migration of artists, and said "The religious fanatics in Algeria destroyed every cultural symbol, shattered statues and rare works of art and liquidated intellectuals and artists, reporters and authors, ballet dancers and singers – are we going to imitate the Algerian and Afghani examples?"&lt;ref name="barel"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/afghanistan-in-palestine-1.165006 Afghanistan in Palestine], by Zvi Bar'el, ''Haaretz'', July 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tayyip Erdoğan's Turkey as a role model===
Some Hamas members stated that the model of Islamic government that Hamas seeks to emulate is that of Turkey under the rule of [[Tayyip Erdoğan]]. The foremost members to distance Hamas from the practices of Taliban and to publicly support the Erdoğan model were [[Ahmad Yousef]] and [[Ghazi Hamad]], advisers to Prime Minister Hanieh.&lt;ref name="Sayigh"&gt;[http://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB41.pdf Hamas Rule in Gaza: Three Years On], [[Yezid Sayigh]], Crown Center for Middle East studies, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/features/letters-from/letter-from-gaza?page=show Letter from Gaza], Hamas's tunnel diplomacy, By Thanassis Cambanis, June 18, 2010.

"Mr. Sawaf's West Bank office in Ramallah has been destroyed, and the Palestinian paper ''Al Ayyam'' has refused to continue printing his paper in the West Bank."&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian daily Al Ayyam added that despite claims by Hamas leaders that it wants to repeat the Turkish model of Islam, "what is happening on the ground in reality is a replica of the Taliban model of Islam."&lt;ref name="hroub2"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hamas-Gaza-extremism.-a0211366448 Hamas-Gaza-extremism], ''The Weekly Middle East Reporter'' (Beirut, Lebanon), August 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antisemitism and anti-Zionism==
{{See also|Racism in the Palestinian territories}}

According to academic Esther Webman, antisemitism is not the main tenet of Hamas ideology, although antisemitic rhetoric is frequent and intense in Hamas leaflets. The leaflets generally do not differentiate between Jews and Zionists. In other Hamas publications and interviews with its leaders, attempts at this differentiation have been made.&lt;ref name=Webman1994&gt;Webman, Esther.

Hamas has made conflicting statements about its readiness to recognize Israel. In 2006 a spokesman signaled readiness to recognize Israel within the 1967 borders. Speaking of requests for Hamas to recognize agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, senior Hamas member Khaled Suleiman said that "these agreements are a reality which we view as such, and therefore I see no problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3249568,00.html |title=Hamas: We'll recognize Israel within '67 borders (Ynetnews, 05.11.06) |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=June 20, 1995 |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2006, a Hamas official ruled out recognition of Israel with reference to West and East Germany, which never recognized each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6146968.stm |title=Hamas: No recognition of Israel|publisher=BBC News |date=November 14, 2006 |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamas Charter (1988)===
{{Main|Hamas Covenant}}
* Article 7 of the Hamas Covenant provides the following quotation, attributed to [[Muhammad]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree (evidently a certain kind of tree), would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Article 22 states that the [[French revolution]], the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], colonialism and both world wars were created by the Zionists or forces supportive of Zionism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You may speak as much as you want about regional and world wars. They were behind World War I, when they were able to destroy the Islamic Caliphate, making financial gains and controlling resources. They obtained the Balfour Declaration, formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world. They were behind World War II, through which they made huge financial gains by trading in armaments, and paved the way for the establishment of their state. It was they who instigated the replacement of the League of Nations with the United Nations and the Security Council to enable them to rule the world through them. There is no war going on anywhere, without having their finger in it.&lt;ref name="yale1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm |title=Hamas Covenant 1988 |publisher=Yale |accessdate=27 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170055/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Article 32 of the Covenant refers to an antisemitic forgery, ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today it is Palestine, tomorrow it will be one country or another. The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are saying.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Statements by Hamas members and clerics to an Arab audience===
In 2008, [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|Imam]] Yousif al-Zahar of Hamas said in his sermon at the ''[[Welayat Mosque|Katib Wilayat]]'' mosque in Gaza that "Jews are a people who cannot be trusted.

Following the rededication of the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem in March 2010, senior Hamas figure al-Zahar called on Palestinians everywhere to observe five minutes of silence "for Israel's disappearance and to identify with Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa mosque". He further stated that "Wherever you have been you've been sent to your destruction. You've killed and murdered your prophets and you have always dealt in loan-sharking and destruction.

On August 10, 2012, Ahmad Bahr, Deputy Speaker of the Hamas Parliament, stated in a sermon that aired on ''[[Al-Aqsa TV]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the enemy sets foot on a single square inch of Islamic land, Jihad becomes an individual duty, incumbent on every Muslim, male or female. A woman may set out [on Jihad] without her husband's permission, and a servant without his master's permission. Why? In order to annihilate those Jews. ...

In an interview with [[Al-Aqsa TV]] on September 12, 2012, Marwan Abu Ras, a Hamas MP, who is also a member of the [[International Union of Muslim Scholars]], stated (as translated by [[MEMRI]]):

On December 26, 2012, Senior Hamas official and Jerusalem bureau chief Ahmed Abu Haliba, called on "all Palestinian factions to resume suicide attacks ... deep inside the Zionist enemy" and said that "we must renew the resistance to occupation in any possible way, above all through armed resistance."

===Statements by Hamas members and clerics to an international audience===

In an interview with ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' on July 27, 2014, Hamas leader [[Khaled Meshaal]] stated:

On January 8, 2012, during a visit to [[Tunis]], Gazan Hamas PM Ismail Haniyeh told The Associated Press on that he disagrees with the anti-Semitic slogans. "We are not against the Jews because they are Jews. Our problem is with those occupying the land of Palestine," he said.

===Statements on the Holocaust===
Hamas has been explicit in its [[Holocaust denial]]. In reaction to the Stockholm conference on [[The Holocaust|the Jewish Holocaust]], held in late January 2000, Hamas issued a press release that it published on its official website, containing the following statements from a senior leader:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This conference bears a clear Zionist goal, aimed at forging history by hiding the truth about the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no basis. (...) The invention of these grand illusions of an alleged crime that never occurred, ignoring the millions of dead European victims of Nazism during the war, clearly reveals the racist Zionist face, which believes in the superiority of the Jewish race over the rest of the nations. (...) By these methods, the Jews in the world flout scientific methods of research whenever that research contradicts their racist interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1946 |title=Palestinian Holocaust Denial |publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |date=2000-04-21 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper ''Al-Risala'' that the Zionists encouraged murder of Jews by the Nazis with the aim of forcing them to immigrate to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/feature/feature-03a.html|title=Holocaust Denial|publisher=www.ajn.com.au|accessdate=September 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207040823/http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/feature/feature-03a.html |archivedate=February 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Khaled Mashal]] called [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s December 14, 2005 statements on the Holocaust that Europeans had "created a myth in the name of Holocaust"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10460807/ Iran leader's Holocaust remarks condemned] MSNBC, December 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) as "courageous".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2005/12/2008410111928749358.html "Hamas springs to Iran's defense"] Al Jazeera, December 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2008, [[Basim Naim]], the minister of health in the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government in Gaza countered holocaust denial, and said "it should be made clear that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian government in Gaza denies the Nazi Holocaust. The Holocaust was not only a crime against humanity but one of the most abhorrent crimes in modern history. We condemn it as we condemn every abuse of humanity and all forms of discrimination on the basis of religion, race, gender or nationality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/12/hamascondemnstheholocaust "Hamas condemns the Holocaust"] ''The Guardian'', May 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Hamas voiced opposition to UNRWA's teaching of the Holocaust in Gaza. According to Hamas, "Holocaust studies in refugee camps is a contemptible plot and serves the Zionist entity with a goal of creating a reality and telling stories in order to justify acts of slaughter against the Palestinian people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Hamas fights UN's 'poisonous' Holocaust lessons in Gazan schools|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/28/hamas-un-holocaust-lessons-gaza|accessdate=July 10, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas to U.N.: Don't Teach Holocaust|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/international/hamas_un_dont_teach_holocaust|newspaper=The Jewish Week|date=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, denounced a visit by Ziad al-Bandak, an adviser to [[Palestinian Authority]] President [[Mahmoud Abbas]], to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] death camp, saying it was "unjustified" and "unhelpful" and only served the "Zionist occupation" while coming "at the expense of a real Palestinian tragedy".

==Violence and terrorism==
{{Main|Criticism of Hamas}}
{{Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel}}
Hamas has used both political activities and violence in pursuit of its goals. For example, while politically engaged in the 2006 Palestinian Territories parliamentary election campaign, Hamas stated in its election manifesto that it was prepared to use "armed resistance to end the occupation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stockholmsfria.nu/artikel/6296|title= Islamistisk politik vinner mark|author=Madelene Axelsson|date=January 27, 2006|publisher=[[Stockholms Fria Tidning]]|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2004, Hamas was responsible for killing nearly 400 Israelis and wounding more than 2,000 in 425 attacks, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 2001 through May 2008, Hamas launched more than 3,000 Qassam rockets and 2,500 mortar attacks into Israel.&lt;ref name="fox1"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473448,00.html Israel At 'War to the Bitter End,' Strikes Key Hamas Sites] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122001830/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473448,00.html# |date=November 22, 2010 }} December 29, 2008, Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack has also been referred to as the [[Netanya suicide attack|Passover massacre]] since it took place on the first night of the Jewish festival of [[Passover]] at a [[Passover Seder|Seder]].

Hamas has defended suicide attacks as a legitimate aspect of its [[asymmetric warfare]] against Israel. In 2003, according to Stephen Atkins, Hamas resumed suicide bombings in Israel as a retaliatory measure after the failure of peace talks and an Israeli campaign targeting members of the upper echelon of the Hamas leadership.&lt;ref name="Atkins" &gt;Stephen E.

On 20 August, Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader in exile in Turkey, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of the three Israeli teens. He delivered an address on behalf of [[Khaled Mashal]] at the conference of the [[International Union of Muslim Scholars]] in [[Istanbul]], a move that might reflect a desire by Hamas to gain leverage.&lt;ref name="HamasAcc"&gt;Jack Khoury, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.611676 Hamas claims responsibility for three Israeli teens' kidnapping and murder,'] ''[[Haaretz]]'' 21 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In it he said: "Our goal was to ignite an [[wikt:intifada|intifada]] in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as within the 1948 borders. ...

Hamas suicide attacks on Israeli civilians have largely disappeared since 2005; this has coincided with an increase in rocket attacks. One analysis suggests that the decline in suicide attacks is not motivated by any lack of supplies or volunteers to carry out such operations, by enhanced Israeli security measures such as the [[West Bank barrier]] (if Israeli actions were the reason, one would expect to see an equal decline in suicide attacks by all Palestinian factions, which is not observed), or by a newfound desire for reconciliation with Israel on the part of Hamas. Rather, suicide bombings provoked targeted killings that decimated the leadership of Hamas, whereas rocket attacks have elicited weaker Israeli reprisals that have tended to harm the Palestinian population as a whole more than Hamas (such as the [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]])&amp;nbsp;– thereby paradoxically increasing Hamas's popular support.&lt;ref name="Where?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Toronto|first=Nathan W.|url=https://www.ict.org.il/Article.aspx?ID=1031|title=Where Have All the Bombers Gone?|work=[[Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya]]|date=2008-04-20|accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rocket attacks on Israel===
Rocket attacks by Hamas have been condemned by Human rights organizations as [[war crime]]s, both because they usually take aim at civilians and because the weapons' inaccuracy would disproportionately endanger civilians even if military targets were chosen. After Operation Pillar of Defense, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that armed Palestinian groups fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities, violating international humanitarian law, and that statements by Palestinian groups that they deliberately targeted Israeli civilians demonstrated an "intent to commit war crimes". HRW's Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said that Palestinian groups made clear that "harming civilians was their aim" and said that launching rockets at populated areas had no legal justification. International humanitarian law prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and intentional violations can be war crimes.&lt;ref name="HRWHamas"/&gt;

According to Human Rights Watch, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001, killing 15 civilians, wounding many more, and posing an ongoing threat to the nearly 800,000 Israeli civilians who live and work in the weapons' range. Hamas officials have said that the rockets were aimed only at military targets, saying that civilian casualties were the "accidental result" of the weapons' poor quality. According to Human Rights Watch, statements by Hamas leaders suggest that the purpose of the rocket attacks was indeed to strike civilians and civilian objects. From January 2009, following [[Operation Cast Lead]], Hamas largely stopped launching rocket attacks on Israel and has on at least two occasions arrested members of other groups who have launched rockets, "showing that it has the ability to impose the law when it wants".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/89574/section/3 HRW report] April 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, Hamas issued a statement regretting any harm that may have befallen Israeli civilians as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks during the Gaza war. It maintained that its rocket attacks had been aimed at Israeli military targets but lacked accuracy and hence sometimes hit civilian areas. Israel responded that Hamas had boasted repeatedly of targeting and murdering civilians in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Al-Mughrabi, Nidal|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE6141LC|title=Hamas "regrets" civilian deaths, Israel unmoved|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one report, commenting on the 2014 conflict, "nearly all the 2,500–3,000 rockets and mortars Hamas has fired at Israel since the start of the war seem to have been aimed at towns", including an attack on "a kibbutz collective farm close to the Gaza border", in which an Israeli child was killed.&lt;ref name="Training Manual"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Luke|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/24/us-mideast-gaza-hamas-document-idUSKBN0GO0D120140824|title=Israel says it found Hamas training manual in Gaza|publisher=Reuters|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Israeli Lt. Col. Jonathan D. Halevi stated that "Hamas has expressed pride in aiming long-range rockets at strategic targets in Israel including the nuclear reactor in Dimona, the chemical plants in Haifa, and Ben-Gurion Airport", which "could have caused thousands" of Israeli casualties "if successful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halevi|first=Jonathan D.|url=http://jcpa.org/hamas-threat-no-different-from-isis/|title=The Hamas Threat to the West Is No Different from ISIS|publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|date=4 August 2014|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008 [[Barack Obama]], then the Democratic presidential candidate, said: "If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that, and I would expect Israelis to do the same thing."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lee Myers and Helene Cooper, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/washington/29diplo.html Obama Defers to Bush, for Now, on Gaza Crisis], New York Times December 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On December 28, 2008, Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] said in a statement: "the United States strongly condemns the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473167,00.html U.S. Condemns Hamas in Midst of Israeli Strikes], Fox News December 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, 2009, Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] condemned the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gid-B97gmhLgqf8brVLEKN46E-Lw Clinton calls for 'durable' Gaza truce, condemns rockets], AFP March 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempts to derail 2010 peace talks===
{{see also|2010 Palestinian militancy campaign}}

In 2010, Hamas, who have been actively sidelined from the peace talks by Israel, spearheaded a coordinated effort by 13 [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant groups, in attempt to derail the stalled [[Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in 2010|peace talks]] between Israel and [[Mahmoud Abbas]], President of the [[Palestinian Authority]]. According to the Israeli [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories]] Major Gen. Eitan Dangot, Israel seeks to work with [[Salam Fayyad]], to help revive the Palestinian economy, and hopes to ease restrictions on the Gaza Strip further, "while somehow preventing the Islamic militants who rule it from getting credit for any progress". According to Dangot, Hamas must not be seen as ruling successfully or be allowed to "get credit for a policy that would improve the lives of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IDF general lays out plan for reviving Gaza economy |agency=The Associated Press |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/idf-general-lays-out-plan-for-reviving-gaza-economy-1.321256 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign consists of attacks against Israelis in which, according to a Hamas declaration in early September, "all options are open".&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0904/1224278203442.html|title=Islamist groups attempt to derail Middle East talks|author=Weiss, Mark|date=September 4, 2010|newspaper=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitnick&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0831/Hamas-targets-Israeli-Palestinian-talks-by-killing-four-Israelis "Hamas targets Israeli-Palestinian talks by killing four Israelis; Hamas took responsibility for the fatal shooting of four Israeli settlers outside Hebron today, on the eve of Israeli-Palestinian talks in Washington,"] Joshua Mitnick, August 31, 2010, ''Christian Science Monitor''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jerusalempoststaff&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=186963|title=Hamas to launch 'more effective attacks' on Israel|date=September 3, 2010|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=excathedraeditorial&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/07/AR2010090705977.html|title=The Shadow of Hamas|date=September 8, 2010|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participating groups also include [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], the [[Popular Resistance Committees]] and an unnamed splinter group of [[Fatah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6811J620100902 Gaza militants vow wave of attacks against Israel], Reuters September 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes of martyrdom===
{{See also|Martyrdom in Islam}}

According to a translation by Palestinian Media Watch, in 2008, Fathi Hamad, a member of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]], stated on [[Al-Aqsa TV]], "For the Palestinian people death became an industry, at which women excel and so do all people on this land: the elderly excel, the Jihad fighters excel, and the children excel. Accordingly (Palestinians) created a human shield of women, children, the elderly and the Jihad fighters against the Zionist bombing machine, as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death as you desire life.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=582&amp;doc_id=507 "Hamas explains using civilians as human shields"], ''[[Palestinian Media Watch]]'', (December 28, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Hamas speaker Ahmad Bahr praised the virtues of martyrdom and Jihad, and said that 2.5 million black-eyed virgins were waiting in the [[Garden of Eden]], which could be entered only by prophets, by the righteous, and by martyrs. He continued by saying that nobody on Earth "will be able to confront the resistance, or to confront the mujahideen, those who worship Allah and seek martyrdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Middle East Research Institute, |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4600.htm|title=Hamas PLC Speaker Ahmad Bahr: 2.5 Million Virgins Await the Prophets, the Righteous, and the Martyrs in a Single Palace in the Garden of Eden|date= September 13, 2010|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guerrilla warfare===
[[File:Weapons Found in Shuja'iya, Gaza (14552909800).jpg|thumb|Hamas anti-tank rockets, captured by Israel Defense Forces during Operation Protective Edge]]
Hamas has made great use of [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] in the Gaza Strip and to a lesser degree the West Bank.&lt;ref name="ynetnews_weight"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3310425,00.html|publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=October 3, 2006|title=Report: Hamas weighing large-scale conflict with Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has successfully adapted these techniques over the years since its inception. According to a 2006 report by rival Fatah party, Hamas had smuggled between several hundred and 1,300 tons of advanced rockets, along with other weaponry, into Gaza.&lt;ref name="ynetnews_weight" /&gt;

===International designations as a terrorist organization===

Hamas, together with several charities it runs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Levitt]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA143 pp. 143–69].&lt;/ref&gt; has been designated by several governments and some academics as a terrorist organization. Others regard Hamas as a complex organization with terrorism as only one component.&lt;ref&gt;Krista Wiegand, [https://books.google.com/books?id=H96cqNJ0fTAC&amp;pg=PA124 ''Bombs and Ballots: Governance by Islamist Terrorist and Guerrilla Groups,''] [[Ashgate Publishing]], Revised edition 2013 p. 124.'Officially, Hamas is considered by American and Israeli policymakers and some academics as the epitome of a terrorist group. ... Due to the gravity and consequences of Hamas's use of terrorism as a tactic, all other aspects of Hamas, including its extensive social services programs and its role as a political party are overshadowed and often ignored by policy makers. Others recognize the complexity of Hamas as an organization and suggest that Hamas will continue to transform itself into a full political party and eventually disarm and cease all violent tactics. They view Hamas as a complex organization with terrorism as only one component, which is likely to evolve into a non-violent political party.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke Peterson ,[https://books.google.com/books?id=nrsbBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 ''Palestine-Israel in the Print News Media: Contending Discourses,''] [[Routledge]] 2014 p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Israel outlawed Hamas in September 1989&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Mannes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJwIhKrx0FAC&amp;pg=PA114 ''Profiles in Terror: The Guide to Middle East Terrorist Organizations,''] [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 2003 p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States followed suit in 1995, as did Canada in November 2002.&lt;ref name="AFPC-NA"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9fQ3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15 ''The World Almanac of Islamism: 2014,''] [[American Foreign Policy Council]]/[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 2014 p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] outlawed Hamas's military wing in 2001 and included Hamas in its list of terrorist organizations in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA50 pp. 50–51].&lt;/ref&gt; which Hamas successfully challenged in the courts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2015/150119_01_en.htm Statement by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini on the decision to appeal the Judgment regarding Hamas], 19/01/2015&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to do so under American and Israeli pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetta Voltalini and Federica Bicchi, 'When Security Trumps Democracy:Israel and Palestined,' Anne Wetzel, Jan Orbie (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MkgTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT206 ''The Substance of EU Democracy Promotion: Concepts and Cases,''] [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2015 pp. 162–76 [170].

While supporting the elections in the Occupied Territories and confirming their regular development, the EU was not willing to accept the results in the light of perceived security concerns and mounting pressure from the US and Israel to boycott Hamas./&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of Hamas's challenge to the EU classification in 2007 was that it was drawn up on the basis of media reports, rather than grounded in any analysis of Hamas's history. In July 2017, the [[European Court of Justice]] overruled this challenge, citing that the evidence of media reports was only used for keeping Hamas on the list, rather than to add it to the list in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-palestinians-hamas-idUSKBN1AB0VE|title=EU court keeps Hamas on terrorism list, removes Tamil Tigers|date=26 July 2017|publisher=[[Retuers]]|quote=The lower court had found that the listing was based on media and internet reports rather than decisions by a "competent authority".

The European General Court found in favour of Hamas in 2014, though the verdict was appealed by the EU countries. In September 2016 a legal advisor to the European Court of Justice, Eleanor Sharpston, provided an advisory opinion, in favour of cancelling the listing of Hamas as a terrorist organization.

===Children as combatants===
{{See also|Children in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
The Israeli government released a video compiled mostly from Arab news sources showing Palestinian children under the age of 15 going through military training and carrying and firing arms. The video's narration explains that Hamas indoctrinates these child combatants and that Hamas operators send the children "on missions from which they would not risk their own lives". According to the Israeli government, the children are used as spotters, to transport explosives and weapons, sent to play in areas to deter Israeli attacks and are sent unknowingly with explosive devices in their schoolbags to be blown up in the vicinity of Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090713221223/http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=58&amp;ar=HamasExploitationofCiviliansV&amp;ak=null "Video: Hamas uses civilians as a means to achieving military goals".] 2009.

On August 2, 2012, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) accused Hamas of harassing elected officials belong to the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate (PJS) in Gaza. The IFJ said that journalists' leaders in Gaza have faced a campaign of intimidation, as well as threats designed to force them to stop their union work. Some of these journalists are now facing charges of illegal activities and a travel ban, due to their refusal "to give in to pressure". The IFJ said that these accusations are "malicious" and "should be dropped immediately". The IFJ explained that the campaign against PJS members began in March 2012, after their election, and included a raid organized by Hamas supporters who took over the PJS offices in Gaza with the help of the security forces, and subsequently evicted the staff and elected officials. Other harassment includes the targeting of individuals who were bullied into stopping union work.

Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said "As living conditions in the Gaza Strip are disastrous, Hamas wants to silence critics and does not hesitate to torture a journalist in order to control media coverage in its territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=769825|title=Reporters Without Borders condemns Hamas for|work=Maan News Agency|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights abuses===
In June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights based in [[Ramallah]] published a report whose findings included that the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an "almost systematic campaign" of human rights abuses by the [[Palestinian Authority]] and Hamas, as well as by Israeli authorities, with the security forces belonging to the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Liel |first=Alon |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=224143 |title='PA bans journalists from reporting human rights abuses' |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Human Rights Watch]] presented a 43 page long list of human rights violation committed by Hamas. Among actions attributed to Hamas the HRW report mentions beatings with metal clubs and rubber hoses, hanging of alleged collaborationists with Israel, and torture of 102 individuals. According to the report, Hamas also tortured civil society activists and peaceful protesters. Reflecting on the captivity of [[Gilad Shalit]], the HRW report described it as "cruel and inhuman". The report also slams Hamas for harassment of people based on so called morality offenses and for media censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4288204,00.html |title=Rights group: Hamas abusing Palestinians in Gaza|publisher=Ynetnews.com |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-israeloccupied-palestinian-territories |title=World Report 2012: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=January 22, 2012 |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a public statement [[Joe Stork]], the deputy Middle East director of HRW claimed, "after five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights and grants impunity to abusive security services." Hamas responded by denying charges and describing them as "politically motivated"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nidal al-Mughrabi |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/03/uk-palestinians-hamas-justice-idUKBRE8920V020121003 |title=Hamas disputes HRW's charges of torture, detentions in Gaza &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2015 Amnesty International released a report saying that Hamas carried out extrajudicial killings, abductions and arrests of Palestinians and used the Al-Shifa Hospital to detain, interrogate and torture suspects during the Israel–Gaza conflict in 2014. It details the executions of at least 23 Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel and torture of dozens of others, many victims of torture were members of the rival Palestinian movement, Fatah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palestine (State of): ‘Strangling Necks' Abductions, torture and summary killings of Palestinians by Hamas forces during the 2014 Gaza/Israel conflict|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/mde2116432015eng.pdf|website=amnesty.org|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=27 May 2015|location=United Kingdom|format=pdf|date=26 May 2015}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaza Palestinians tortured, summarily killed by Hamas forces during 2014 conflict|url=https://www.amnesty.org/press-releases/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150527024539/https://www.amnesty.org/press-releases/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 May 2015|accessdate=27 May 2015|work=[[Amnesty International]]|date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International support==

Hamas has always maintained leadership abroad. The movement is deliberately fragmented to ensure that Israel cannot kill its top political and military leaders.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/how-hamas-lost-the-arab-spring/277102/|title=How Hamas Lost the Arab Spring|first=Jonathan|last=Schanzer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas used to be strongly allied with both Iran and Syria. Iran gave Hamas an estimated $13–15 million in 2011 as well as access to long-range missiles. Hamas's political bureau was once located in the Syrian capital of Damascus before the start of the Syrian civil war. Relations between Hamas, Iran, and Syria began to turn cold when Hamas refused to back the government of Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Instead, Hamas backed the Sunni rebels fighting against Assad. As a result, Iran cut funding to Hamas, and their terror proxy Hezbollah ordered Hamas members out of Lebanon.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3033681/hamas-gaza-palestine-israel-egypt/|title=Hamas Still Has Some Friends Left|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas was then forced out of Syria. Since then, Iran and Hezbollah have tried to mend fences with Hamas.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; Hamas contacted Jordan and Sudan to see if either would open up its borders to its political bureau. But both countries refused&amp;nbsp;– though they welcomed many Hamas members leaving Syria.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/04/hamas-qatar-relationship-independence.html#|title=Hamas Ties to Qatar Have Cost|date=April 22, 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616195431/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/04/hamas-qatar-relationship-independence.html|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Hamas headquarters subsequently moved to Doha, Qatar.&lt;ref name="stopterrorfinance.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopterrorfinance.org/blog/510641507-is-gaza-reconstruction-aid-rearming-hamas|title=Is Gaza Reconstruction Aid Rearming Hamas? |author=CATF Reports |publisher=Consortium Against Terrorist Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012 to 2013, under the leadership of [[Muslim Brotherhood]] President [[Mohamed Morsi]], Hamas had the support of Egypt. However, when Morsi was removed from Office, his replacement [[Abdul Fattah al-Sisi]] outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and destroyed the tunnels Hamas built into Egypt. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are likewise hostile to Hamas. Like Egypt, they designated the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization and Hamas was viewed as its Palestinian equivalent.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

===Qatar and Turkey===
According to Middle East experts, now Hamas has two firm allies: [[Qatar]] and [[Turkey]]. Both give Hamas public and financial assistance estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Shashank Joshi, senior research fellow at the [[Royal United Services Institute]], says that "Qatar also hosts Hamas's political bureau which includes Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal." Meshaal also visits Turkey frequently to meet with Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]].&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; Erdogan has dedicated himself to breaking Hamas out of its political and economic seclusion. Last year on U.S. television Erdogan said, "I don't see Hamas as a terror organization. Hamas is a political party."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;

In 2007, Qatar was, with Turkey, the only country to back Hamas after the group ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; The relationship between Hamas and Qatar strengthened in 2008 and 2009 when Khaled Meshaal was invited to attend the Doha Summit where he was seated next to the then Qatari Emir [[Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani]], who pledged $250 million to repair the damage caused by the Israel in the Israeli war on Gaza.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com"/&gt; These events caused Qatar to become the main player in the "Palestinian issue". Qatar called Gaza's blockade unjust and immoral, which prompted the Hamas government in Gaza, including former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, to thank Qatar for their "unconditional" support. Qatar then began regularly handing out political, material, humanitarian and charitable support for Hamas.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com"/&gt;

In 2012, Qatar's former Emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, became the first head of state to visit Gaza under Hamas rule. He pledged to raise $400 million for reconstruction. Some have argued that the money Qatar gives to reconstruct Palestine is an excuse to pour even more money into Hamas.&lt;ref name="stopterrorfinance.org"/&gt; Qatar's reason for funding Hamas, which is shared by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is allegedly that Islamist groups are growing and will eventually play a role in the region; thus it is important for Qatar (and Turkey) to maintain ties. During the Arab Spring, for example, Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Islamist group whose offshoot is Hamas.&lt;ref name="jta.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2014/09/14/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/why-does-qatar-support-hamas|title=Why does Qatar support Hamas?|date=September 14, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources say that advocating for Hamas is politically beneficial to Turkey and Qatar because the Palestinian cause draws popular support amongst their citizens at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/06/world/meast/mideast-hamas-support/index.html|title=Which Mideast power brokers support Hamas? |first=Josh |last=Levs|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some began to label Qatar a terrorist haven in part because it is harboring Hamas leader Meshaal.&lt;ref name="jta.org"/&gt; They also harbor Husam Badran, former leader of Hamas's military wing in the northern West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bbcwatch.org/tag/husam-badran/|title=Husam Badran |publisher=BBC Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Husam Badran]], current media spokesman for Hamas, was the instigator of several of the deadliest suicide bombings of the [[Second Intifada|second intifada]], including the [[Dolphinarium discotheque massacre|Dolphinarium discotheque bombing]] in Tel Aviv, which killed 21 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2011/10/18/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/murderers-row-who-are-the-terrorists-being-freed-in-the-shalit-deal|title=Murderers' Row: Who are the terrorists being freed in the Shalit deal?|date=October 18, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey has also been criticized for housing terrorists including [[Saleh al-Arouri]], the senior Hamas officer, known for his ability to mastermind attacks from abroad. Al-Arouri is alleged to have orchestrated the June 2014 abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers and to have started the 50-day war between Israel and Palestine, and now lives in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CATF Reports |date=March 18, 2016 |title=A Rising Terror Threat: Hamas, Underground Tunnels, and Remote Control |url=http://stopterrorfinance.org/blog/510702345-a-rising-terror-threat-hamas-underground-tunnels-and-remote-control |publisher=Consortium Against Terrorist Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in reference to Qatar's support for Hamas, during a 2015 visit to Palestine, Qatari official Mohammad al-Emadi, said Qatar is using the money not to help Hamas but rather the Palestinian people as a whole. He acknowledges however that giving to the Palestinian people means using Hamas as the local contact. Emadi said, "You have to support them. You don't like them, don't like them. But they control the country, you know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/06/18/414693807/why-israel-lets-qatar-give-millions-to-hamas|title=Why Israel Lets Qatar Give Millions To Hamas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Hamas's relations with Qatar are putting Hamas in an awkward position because Qatar has become part of the regional Arab problem.

But Hamas claims that having contacts with various Arab countries establishes positive relations which will encourage Arab countries to do their duty toward the Palestinians and support their cause by influencing public opinion in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com"/&gt; In March 2015, Hamas has announced its support of the [[Saudi Arabia]]n-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Houthis]] and forces loyal to former President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/725241 Hamas supports military operation for political legitimacy in Yemen]. Arab News. 30 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, [[Turkish President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] [[Twitter|tweeted]] to the [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] that Hamas is not a terrorist organization but a resistance movement that defends the Palestinian homeland against an occupying power. During that period there were conflicts between Israeli troops and Palestinian protestors in the Gaza Strip, due to the decision of the [[United States]] to move [[Embassy of the United States, Israel|their embassy to Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/246031 Erdogan: Hamas is not a terrorist organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
After the Hamas victory in 2006, China did not label it a “terrorist organization” and welcomed Hamas’ foreign minister, [[Mahmoud al-Zahar]], to Beijing for the [[Sino-Arab_relations#Sino-Arab_Cooperation_Forum|China-Arab Cooperation Forum]] ignoring protests by both the United States and Israel but receiving praise from Mahmoud Abbas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China’s Palestine Policy - Jamestown |url=https://jamestown.org/program/chinas-palestine-policy/ |website=Jamestown |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Palestine Supports China on the South China Sea |url=https://thediplomat.com/2016/07/why-palestine-supports-china-on-the-south-china-sea/ |website=The Diplomat |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has harshly criticised Israel for its economic blockade of Gaza since 2007 when Hamas assumed control of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kuttab |first1=Daoud |title=China pledges support for Palestine, but keeps the door open to Israel |url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2017/7/19/abbas-seeks-out-chinese-support-for-palestine-1 |website=alaraby |accessdate=8 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China’s Palestine Policy - Jamestown |url=https://jamestown.org/program/chinas-palestine-policy/ |website=Jamestown |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese foreign ministry spokesman [[Liu Jianchao]] stated, “We believe that the Palestinian government is legally elected by the people there and it should be respected”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hamas' Zahar hails China trip as a success |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2006-06/02/content_607586_2.htm |website=www.chinadaily.com.cn |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, a spokesman from China’s foreign ministry embraced the Hamas-Fatah agreement to form an interim government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sutter |first1=Robert |title=Chinese Foreign Relations: Power and Policy since the Cold War |isbn=1442211369 |page=308 |edition=3 |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=r2WpKLDgRDYC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308&amp;dq=china+%22hamas%22+relations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nbi7oi75Nj&amp;sig=gVY2pXu0lVS6qj8IxNfar2gQGj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjxzNaOzPfdAhWGPOwKHX0kBio4FBDoATADegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=hamas&amp;f=false |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Chinese Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]] called on Israel to lift its blockade and advised both Israel and Hamas to cease fighting. He reaffirmed support from China to the Palestinian people’s right to establish  an independent state. He told a joint press conference, “China will grant $1.5 million in emergency humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China FM urges ceasefire in Gaza with five-point proposal - World - Chinadaily.com.cn |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2014-08/04/content_18241189.htm |website=www.chinadaily.com.cn |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2018, China voted in support of a [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution vetoed by the US that criticized Israel of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force by the Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians in Gaza during the [[2018 Gaza border protests]]. Later the same day, China [[Abstention|abstained]] from voting on a US drafted resolution that blamed Hamas for the escalated violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Security Council fails to adopt U.S.-drafted resolution on Palestine - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/02/c_137224238.htm |website=www.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Campos |first1=Rodrigo |title=U.S. vetoes U.N. resolution denouncing violence against Palestinians |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestine-un-vote/u-s-vetoes-u-n-resolution-denouncing-violence-against-palestinians-idUSKCN1IX5UW |website=U.S. |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S.-based support===
Several U.S. organizations were either shut down or held liable for financing Hamas in early 2001, groups that have origins from the mid-1990s: the [[Holy Land Foundation]] (HLF), [[Islamic Association for Palestine]] (IAP), and Kind Hearts. The U.S. Treasury Department specially designated the HLF in 2001 for terror ties: "from 1995 to 2001 the HLF transferred "approximately $12.4 million outside of the United States with the intent to contribute funds, goods, and services to Hamas." According to the Treasury Department, Khaled Meshal identified one of HLF's officers, Mohammed El-Mezain as "the Hamas leader for the U.S." In 2003, IAP was found liable for financially supporting Hamas, and in 2006, Kind Hearts had their assets frozen for supporting Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetower.org/3260oc-former-treasury-official-same-network-that-funded-hamas-in-u-s-backs-boycotts-of-israel/|title=Former Treasury Official: Same Network That Funded Hamas in U.S. Backs Boycotts of Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was reported that the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement (BDS) against Israel includes a web of Hamas supporters from the Illinois-based organization [[American Muslims for Palestine]] (AMP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/congressional-testimony-highlights-ties-between-hamas-linked-charities-bds/|title=Ties between Hamas-linked charities and BDS highlighted in Congressional testimony|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Him Whom God shall make manifest''' ({{lang-ar|من يظهر الله}}, {{lang-fa| مظهر کلّیه الهی}}) is a [[messianic figure]] in the religion of [[Bábism]].  The messianic figure was repeatedly mentioned by the [[Báb]], the founder of Bábism, in His book, the [[Bayán]].  The Báb described the messianic figure as the origin of all divine attributes, and stated that his command was equivalent to [[God]]’s command.  The Báb stated that once the messianic figure had arrived, the perusal of one of his verses was to be greater&lt;!-- "of more use"?--&gt; than a thousand perusals of the [[Bayán]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter | encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= He whom God shall make Manifest |year= 2000 | publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages = 180–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prediction is widely recognized as being fulfilled by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].&lt;ref name= "eor"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Bahā'īs | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | isbn = 0-02-865733-0 | pages = 737–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Báb's execution in 1850, there were some Bábis who claimed to be ''He whom God shall make manifest''.&lt;ref name ="PSmith"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "PSmith2"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter | encyclopedia = A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith | title= Dayyan |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 | page = 118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1863, [[Bahá'u'lláh]] privately laid claim to be the messianic figure, and made his claim publicly in 1866–1868.  Those who followed him became known as Bahá'ís, and his claim was by far the most successful.  The [[Azalis]] (those Babis who did not accept Bahá'u'lláh) objected to Bahá'u'lláh's statement,&lt;ref name ="PSmith" /&gt; and shortly after Bahá'u'lláh's claim first started to attract attention, Bahá'í historians report that [[Subh-i-Azal]] made a claim to the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi | title = God Passes By | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-11.html#pg167 | page = 167 | quote = The [[Universal House of Justice]] reiterates this in at least one letter to a Bahá'í, although most likely uses the former as its source}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Growth in New Zealand==

===Easing of Immigration Policies and Increased Immigration: 1987-2001===
In the 1991 Census, surging migration as a result of the Immigration Act 1987 made the number of Hindus surpass 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10837744&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aen.org.nz/journal/2/2/AENJ.2.2.Nachowitz.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic liberalisation in India|India's Economic Liberalisation]] occurred in the same year, increasing the standard of living and allowing more immigrants to come in the future. The 1996 New Zealand Census showed the eased immigration laws resulted in the number of Hindus growing from 18,000 in 1991 to surpassing 25,000 for the first time. This was largely due to the continued success of the Immigration Act 1987.

===Fast Growth and Slowdown: 2001-2012===
In the 2001 Census, the population of Hindus was at almost 40 000, meaning that the number of Hindus tripled in the 10 years since the 1991 census. The 2006 census showed the number of Hindus to be 64,557, an increase of nearly 62% from the previous census in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=764bb61d-abf9-43a4-bfbc-8931cefc33b3&amp; More Hindu temples to come up in New Zealand] Hindustan Times - April 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the number of Hindus in New Zealand then slowed in the years between the 2006 Census and the 2013 Census because of a mixture of events. [[Violence against Indians in Australia controversy|the heightened violence against Indian Australians]](2007-2010) and the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]] were the main reasons why growth of Hindus declined. The latter was also the main reason why the Census year was moved from 2011 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10708648&lt;/ref&gt; The slowdown in long term migration was partially offset by soaring numbers of Indian Students and Skilled Migrants, whose numbers increased rapidly during the [[Great Recession]] partly due to costs being cheaper and a better economic outlook.&lt;ref&gt;http://dol.govt.nz/research/migration/monthly-migration-trends/12jun/large.asp?id=fig4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merinews.com/article/recession-boosts-new-zealand-migration/15764938.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The recently conducted 2013 Census showed the Hindu population made up slightly over 2% of the population, with 90,018 adherents. This increased Hinduism's share of the total New Zealand population by 0.5% despite immigration slowing as a result of the events mentioned earlier.

{{Humanism}}
{{Judaism}}

'''Humanistic Judaism''' ({{Lang-he-n|יהדות הומניסטית}} ''Yahadut Humanistit'') is a [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish movement]] that offers a [[nontheism|nontheistic]] alternative in contemporary [[Jewish culture|Jewish life]]. It defines [[Judaism]] as the cultural and historical experience of the [[Jewish people]] and encourages [[humanism|humanistic]] and [[secular Jews]] to celebrate their [[Jewish identity]] by participating in [[Jewish holidays]] and [[Rite of passage|lifecycle events]] (such as weddings and [[bar and bat mitzvah]]s) with inspirational ceremonies that draw upon but go beyond traditional literature.

Its philosophical foundation includes the following ideas:

* A [[Jew]] is someone who identifies with the history, [[culture]], and future of the Jewish people;
* Judaism is the historic culture of the Jewish people, and [[religion]] is only one part of that culture;
* Jewish identity is best preserved in a free, pluralistic environment;
* People possess the power and responsibility to shape their own lives independent of supernatural authority;
* Ethics and morality should serve human needs, and choices should be based upon consideration of the consequences of actions rather than pre-ordained rules or commandments;
* Jewish history, like all history, is a human saga, a testament to the significance of human power and human responsibility. Biblical and other traditional texts are the products of human activity and are best understood through archaeology and other scientific analysis.
* The freedom and dignity of the Jewish people must go hand in hand with the freedom and dignity of every human being.&lt;ref&gt;"What is Humanistic Judaism?" The Society for Humanistic Judaism.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In its current form, Humanistic Judaism was founded in 1963 by Rabbi [[Sherwin Wine]].&lt;ref name="IFSHJ_Homepage"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ifshj.org/ | title=International Federation for Secular &amp; Humanistic Judaism | accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sherwin Wine, 79, Founder of Splinter Judaism Group, Dies |last=Hevesi |first=Dennis |date=July 25, 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2010-12-16 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/us/25wine1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a rabbi trained in [[Reform Judaism]], with a small secular, non-theistic congregation in Michigan, Wine developed a Jewish liturgy that reflected his and his congregation’s philosophical viewpoint by emphasizing Jewish culture, history, and identity along with Humanistic ethics, while excluding all prayers and references to God. This congregation developed into the [[Birmingham Temple]], now in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]]. It was soon joined by a previously Reform congregation in Illinois, as well as a group in Westport, Connecticut.

In 1969, these congregations and others were united organizationally under the umbrella of the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] (SHJ). The Society for Humanistic Judaism has 10,000 members in 30 congregations spread throughout the United States and Canada.

The International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism was founded in 1986. It is the academic and intellectual center of Humanistic Judaism. It was established in Jerusalem in 1985 and currently has two centers of activity: one in Jerusalem and the other in [[Lincolnshire, Illinois|Lincolnshire]], IL. Rabbi Adam Chalom is the North American dean. The Institute offers professional training programs for Spokespersons, Educators, Leaders (also referred to in Hebrew as ''madrikhim/ot'' or in Yiddish as ''vegvayzer''), and [[Rabbi]]s, in addition to its publications, public seminars and colloquia for lay audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iishj.org/index.html |title=Home &amp;#124; International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism |publisher=Iishj.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001234821/http://iishj.org/index.html |archivedate=2013-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of belief and practice==

[[File:Humanorah (Society for Humanistic Judaism).png|left|thumb|The humanorah, which is the primary symbol of the Society for Humanistic Judaism.]]

Humanistic Judaism presents a far more radical departure from traditional Jewish religion than [[Mordecai Kaplan]] (co-founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]) ever envisioned.  Kaplan redefined God and other traditional religious terms so as to make them consistent with the naturalist outlook, and continued to use traditional prayer language.  Wine rejected this approach as confusing, since participants could ascribe to these words whatever definitions they favored.&lt;ref name="judaismbeyondgod"&gt;{{cite book | title=Judaism Beyond God | publisher=Society for Humanistic Judaism | author=Wine, Sherwin | year=1985 | isbn=978-0912645087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine strove to achieve philosophical consistency and stability by creating rituals and ceremonies that were purely non-theistic.  Services were created for [[Shabbat]], [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Yom Kippur]], and other Jewish holidays and festivals, often with reinterpretation of the meaning of the holiday to bring it into conformity with [[Secular Humanism|Secular Humanistic]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="festivals"&gt;{{cite book | title=Festivals, folklore &amp; philosophy: A secularist revisits Jewish traditions | publisher=Sholom Aleichem Club | author=Rosenfeld, Max | year=1997 | isbn=978-0961087029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanistic Judaism was developed as a possible solution to the problem of retaining Jewish identity and continuity among non-religious. Recognizing that congregational religious life was thriving, Wine believed that secular Jews who had rejected theism would be attracted to an organization that provided all the same forms and activities as, for example, Reform temples, but which expressed a purely Secular Humanistic viewpoint. The [[International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism]], which is sponsored by the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] and the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations, trains rabbis and other leaders in the United States and in Israel. The Society for Humanistic Judaism was organized with the mission to mobilize people to celebrate Jewish identity and culture consistent with a humanistic philosophy of life.

==Jewish identity and intermarriage==
Within Humanistic Judaism, Jewish identity is largely a matter of self-identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanisticrabbis.org/conversion/ "We believe: 1. That Jewish identity is primarily a cultural and ethnic identity. 2. That belief systems are too diverse among Jews to serve as criteria for membership.
3. That joining the Jewish community is a process of cultural identification.
4. That a person who seeks to embrace Jewish identity should be encouraged to do so and should be assisted in this endeavor.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis and other trained leaders officiate at intermarriages between Jews and non-Jews, and the Humanistic Judaism movement, unlike the Conservative and Orthodox Jewish denominations, does not take any position or action in opposition to intermarriage, rather it affirms that "Intermarriage is an American Jewish reality—a natural consequence of a liberal society in which individuals have the freedom to marry whomever they wish...that intermarriage is neither good nor bad, just as we believe that the marriage of two Jews, in itself, is neither good nor bad.  The moral worth of a marriage always depends on the quality of the human relationship—on the degree of mutual love and respect that prevails."&lt;ref&gt;"Statement on Intermarriage". Association of Humanistic Rabbis, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Secular Humanistic rabbis and leaders will also co-officiate at intercultural marriages between Jews and non-Jews. These views concerning Jewish identity and intermarriage are criticized by those who believe that they will hasten the assimilation of Jews into the general society and thus adversely affect Jewish continuity.

==Egalitarianism==
Humanistic Judaism is [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] with respect to gender and gender identification, Jewish status, and sexual orientation. [[Brit shalom (naming ceremony)|Brit shalom]] (baby-naming ceremonies), similar for boys and girls, are performed rather than the [[brit milah]]. Those who identify as Jews and those who do not, as well as [[LGBTI]] members, may participate in all ways in all Humanistic Jewish rituals and leadership roles.

Humanistic Judaism ordains both men and women as rabbis, and its first rabbi was a woman, [[Tamara Kolton]], who was ordained in 1999.&lt;ref name="shj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/shjbios.htm |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism - Rabbis and Leadership |publisher=Shj.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928164758/http://www.shj.org/shjbios.htm |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first cantor was also a woman, [[Hazzan Deborah Davis|Deborah Davis]], ordained in 2001;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmwc.org/Women/womend.html |title=Contributions of Jewish Women to Music and Women to Jewish Music |publisher=JMWC |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512020657/http://www.jmwc.org/Women/womend.html |archivedate=2016-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Humanistic Judaism has since stopped ordaining cantors{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] issued a statement in 1996 stating in part, "we affirm that a woman has the moral right and should have the continuing legal right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with her own ethical standards. Because a decision to terminate a pregnancy carries serious, irreversible consequences, it is one to be made with great care and with keen awareness of the complex psychological, emotional, and ethical implications." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shj.org/Choice.htm |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism - Reproductive Choice Abortion |publisher=Shj.org |date=1996-08-28 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040305165842/http://www.shj.org/Choice.htm |archivedate=2004-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also issued a statement in 2011 condemning the passage of the “[[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]]” by the U.S. House of Representatives, which they called "a direct attack on a woman’s right to choose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/NewsAbortionFunding.html |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism Condemns Limit on Choice |publisher=Shj.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709054548/http://www.shj.org/NewsAbortionFunding.html |archivedate=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 they issued a resolution opposing conscience clauses that allow religious-affiliated institutions to be exempt from generally applicable requirements mandating reproductive healthcare services to individuals or employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/ConscienceClauses.html |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism Opposes Conscience Clauses |publisher=Shj.org |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725135714/http://www.shj.org/ConscienceClauses.html |archivedate=July 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 they issued a resolution stating in part, "Therefore, be it resolved that: The Society for Humanistic Judaism wholeheartedly supports the observance of [[Women's Equality Day]] on August 26 to commemorate the anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing women to vote; The Society condemns gender discrimination in all its forms, including restriction of rights, limited access to education, violence, and subjugation; and The Society commits itself to maintain vigilance and speak out in the fight to bring gender equality to our generation and to the generations that follow." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/WomensEqualityDay.html |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism - Gender Equality |publisher=Shj.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928161629/http://www.shj.org/WomensEqualityDay.html |archivedate=September 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] issued a resolution supporting "the legal recognition of marriage and divorce between adults of the same sex", and affirming "the value of marriage between any two committed adults with the sense of obligations, responsibilities, and consequences thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/MarriageEquality.htm |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism - Same Sex Marriage |publisher=Shj.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010054121/http://www.shj.org/MarriageEquality.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 they pledged to speak out against homophobic bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/Homophobic%20Bullying.html |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism Pledge Against Homophobic Bullying |publisher=Shj.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725123301/http://www.shj.org/Homophobic%20Bullying.html |archivedate=July 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Jatha''' is an armed body of Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nrN077AEgzMC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;dq=jatha+sikhs+armed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fNlmUa-GFefC4AOglIHgAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=jatha%20sikhs%20armed&amp;f=false ''Civil Wars of the World: Major Conflicts Since World War II, Volume 1'']&lt;/ref&gt; They have existed in Sikh tradition since the beginning of the [[Khalsa]] (Sikh community) in 1699 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who are Sikhs? What is Sikhism?|url=http://www.sikhnet.com/pages/who-are-sikhs-what-is-sikhism|website=Sikhnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Damdami Taksal Jatha==
After the creation of the Khalsa, Guru Gobind Singh is said to have created the [[Damdami Taksal]] in 1706. Its first Jathedar (leader) was [[Baba Deep Singh]] who died at the age of 83 by having his head severed in a battle against Mughal forces.

==Sikh Jatha during British Rule==
During the British rule in the Punjab, northern India. Which took the longest and most difficult land to gain during the British Conquest.  During this time, the British imprisoned many Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims which led to many villages and towns being raided by the British police.&lt;ref name=r3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhlionz.com/historyofbritishraaj.htm|title= Sikh history in British India|first=Ernest|last=Abel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of India were Muslims and Hindus, even during these difficult times the Sikhs began forming more jathas and new armed squads in British India, villages and towns relied on the protection of the Sikh jathas. Sikhs carried out many attacks and assassinations on the British while in India, which succeeded and Sikhs were brought under arrest and executed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Sikhs played the most influential role in the [[Indian independence movement]]. These include [[Bhagat Singh]]  and [[Udham Singh]] who traveled to London and gunned down people who got away with the killings in India. Most Sikh prison inmates were executed after the assassination of a high ranking British officer [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon]], head of the [[Simon Commission]] from the British Parliament.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; Then soon after a bomb blast in the British courts. Bhagat Singh was said to have been behind most of the actions carried out against the British and was later hanged.

Some Sikh jathas such as the [[Babbar Akali Movement]], formed in 1921, rejected non-violence and gave stiff resistance to the British, which led to bloody brawls. The British rule soon left India, but before leaving the crucial decision of where the border of the new country of Pakistan will lay.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; Many historians say the biggest mistake the British made before they left India was splitting the Sikh main land of Punjab in two, giving half to Pakistan and the other half to be run by a Hindu Government.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; This led to non-stop bloodshed between many Sikhs and Muslims. Thousands of Muslims fled the Punjab to go Pakistan and thousands of Sikhs left Pakistan to go to 'New' Punjab, but this journey would result in thousands of lives killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f45aKfnTCJIC&amp;pg=PA50 |title= Literary polyrhythms: new voices in new writings in English |chapter=The River Churning |author=J.

He was nominated again for Best Supporting Actor for his performance opposite [[Clint Eastwood]] in the 1974 film ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]''.&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; In 1976, he starred as the protagonist Jack Prescott in the first remake of ''[[King Kong (1976)|King Kong]]'', opposite [[Jessica Lange]]. This film was a commercial success, earning $90&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, more than triple its $23&amp;nbsp;million budget, and also winning an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Award for special effects]].

One of his better-known roles was in the 1982 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] film ''[[Tron]]'', in which he played Kevin Flynn, a video [[game programmer]] (a role he reprised in late 2010 with the sequel ''[[Tron: Legacy]]''). The same year (1982), he also starred in ''[[Kiss Me Goodbye (film)|Kiss Me Goodbye]]'', an American romantic comedy film directed by [[Robert Mulligan]] that also starred [[Sally Field]]. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1984, for playing the alien in ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]''.&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; He was also acclaimed for his roles in the thriller ''[[Against All Odds (film)|Against All Odds]]'' (1984) and the crime drama ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (1985). His role in ''[[Fearless (1993 film)|Fearless]]'' (1993) is thought by some critics to be one of his best performances.&lt;ref name="popmatters" /&gt; One critic dubbed it a masterpiece;&lt;ref name="fearless" /&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] wrote that he "may be the most natural and least self-conscious screen actor that has ever lived".&lt;ref name="French" /&gt; In 1994, he starred as Lt. Jimmy Dove in the action film [[Blown Away (1994 film)|''Blown Away'']], opposite [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Forest Whitaker]]. His real life father [[Lloyd Bridges]] also featured in the film, playing the uncle of Bridges' character. The film managed to recoup $30 million of its $50 million budget at the box office. It was up against another explosive-themed film, ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', which had been released a few weeks before Bridges' film. On July 11, 1994, Bridges received a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his contributions to the motion picture industry.

=== Music ===
Referring to his career as an actor and his passion for music, Bridges says, "I dug what an actor did, but it took me a while to feel it, to truly appreciate the craft and the preparation. Plus, I was still playing music a lot, and I guess I had a hard time choosing: was I an actor or a musician, or could I be both?"&lt;ref&gt;Guitar Aficionado Magazine – Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridges studied piano at a young age, strongly encouraged by his mother.&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qntfBwX6Kgg|title=Gretsch Guitars: Jeff Bridges|date=July 20, 2011|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working on the 1980 film ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', he often played guitar with his co-star, singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]], between takes.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} His character in ''Crazy Heart'', Bad Blake, was later based partly on Kristofferson.

[[Image:Collier jeremy.jpg|180px|right|Jeremy Collier]]
'''Jeremy Collier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|l|i|ər}}; 23 September 1650 – 26 April 1726) was an English theatre &lt;!--not theatre, he was English--&gt; critic, [[Nonjuring schism|non-juror]] bishop and theologian.

==Life==

Born Jeremiah Collier, in [[Stow cum Quy]], Cambridgeshire, Collier was educated at [[Caius College]], [[University of Cambridge]], receiving the BA (1673) and MA (1676).  A supporter of [[James II of England|James II]], he refused, as a nonjuror (see [[Nonjuring schism]]) to take the oath of allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. Furthering his obvious disapproval of the new monarchs, he publicly absolved two [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] who had conspired to assassinate the King and Queen. In 1713 he was consecrated a non-juror bishop by [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]] and two Scottish bishops, [[Archibald Campbell (bishop)|Archibald Campbell]] and [[James Gadderar]].

==Works==

Collier was the primus of the nonjuring line and a strong supporter of the four usages. (see [[Nonjuring schism]]) In the years following the Revolution he wrote a series of tracts questioning the legitimacy of the new monarchs and the deprival of the Non-juror bishops. He was well known for his ''Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain'', 1708–1714, which was attacked for its tendentious political and theological comments, but nevertheless widely used. His ''Reasons for restoring some prayers and directions, as they stand in the communion-service of the first English reform'd liturgy'', 1717 was the first salvo in the usages debate. His Essays were popular in his own day but are now little read. Collier wrote [[anti-theatrical polemic]] but was a high-church monarchist, unlike the many [[Puritans]] who wrote in this genre as well.
Collier also translated the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius into English.

===Collier Controversy===

In the history of English drama, Collier is known for his [[Antitheatricality|anti-theatrical]] attack on the comedy of the 1690s in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' (1698), which draws for its ammunition mostly on the plays of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]], [[John Vanbrugh]], [[John Dryden]], and [[Thomas D'Urfey]]. At the start of the [[English Civil War]] (1642) theatres were closed and in 1647 a law was passed to punish anyone who participated in or viewed drama. After the war, and during the [[English Interregnum]], the Puritans, under [[Oliver Cromwell]], had control of most of the English government.  They placed heavy restrictions on entertainment and entertainment venues that were perceived as being pagan or immoral. In the [[English Restoration]] (1660), playwrights reacted against the Puritanical restrictions with much more decadent plays. The plays produced in the Restoration drew comparisons to the great [[Elizabethan drama]]s by critics of the day. However, these plays were considered vulgar because they mocked and disrespected marriage, morals, and the clergy. Furthermore, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] allowed women to act on stage; some of the first actresses were of ill-repute. Collier's pamphlets sought to stem the spread of vice but turned out to be the sparks that kindled a controversial flame between like-minded Puritans and Restoration dramatists.

Collier devotes nearly 300 pages to decry what he perceived as profanity and moral degeneration in the stage productions of the era.  This ranged from general attacks on the morality of Restoration theatre to very specific indictments of playwrights of the day.  Collier argued that a venue as influential as the theatre—it was believed then that the theatre should be providing moral instruction—should not have content that is morally detrimental. These pamphlets began a pamphlet war (see:[[Pamphlet wars]]) between Collier and some playwrights like [[Vanbrugh]]. Many of the playwrights responded with equally vehement attacks, but some were so deeply affected, they withdrew from theatre permanently or substantially changed their approach to writing comedies, William Congreve amongst them.

==Aftermath==
Although the theatre styles of the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] lasted a while even after Collier's pamphlets, a new and more restrained theatre began to develop due, in part, to Collier's critiques. Due to the strict morals of the [[Puritans]] as well as others such as Collier, [[neoclassism]] drama began to emerge even while Restoration drama was still flourishing. During Collier's time, Societies for the Reformation of Manners dedicated themselves to maintaining honour in playhouses.

== Dictionary ==

Collier published an early encyclopedia in 1701, ''The great historical, geographical, genealogical and poetical dictionary''. He freely admitted that the text was based on a number of earlier historians, but especially out of the eight edition of [[Louis Moréri]]'s  ''Grand Dictionnaire Historique''. This was issued in two volumes in London from 1701-1705 with an appendix covering the time period from 1688 "by another hand" being issued in the latter year. A further appendix was issued in 1721 and a second edition in 1727. The work was not considered a success as Colliers additions were not of the same quality as the source text and it came out during the same period as the ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Collison, Robert Lewis. ''Encyclopaedias: their history throughout the ages; a bibliographical guide with extensive historical notes to the general encyclopaedias issued throughout the world from 350 B.C. to the present day.'' New York, Hafner, 1966 p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Collier died on 26 April 1726 and was buried on 29 April in [[Old St. Pancras]] Churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;The Environs of London: Pancras (1795)&lt;/ref&gt; The grave is lost but Collier is not listed on the [[Burdett-Coutts Memorial]] to the important graves lost therin.

'''Johannes Greber''' (1874–1944) born in Wenigerath, Germany, was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] who later became a [[Mediumship|medium]] and involved in a variety of [[spiritualist]] activities.

In Germany, he was ordained in 1900 and served a church in the poor area of Hunsrueck. Many in the area suffered from tuberculosis, even ‘’organizing nurses to treat large numbers of tuberculosis’’.&lt;ref&gt;p. 97. William Paul. 2003. ''English Language Bible Translators''. Jefferson, NC &amp; London: McFarland and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; During WW1, he also helped thousands of children escape the war by fleeing into Holland.

In 1923, he attended a séance and his life was changed. He renounced his vows and left the Catholic church. He emigrated to the USA in 1929 and began prayer and healing sessions in New York. He later worked on a translation of the New Testament, publishing ‘’The New Testament, A New Translation and Explanation Based on the Oldest Manuscripts’’ (1937). He claimed supernatural guidance as he translated with his wife acting as a medium, to the point that the text he translated. “In the rare instances in which a text pronounced correct by the divine sprits can be found in none of the manuscripts available today, I have the text as given by the spirits.”&lt;ref&gt;p. 97. William Paul. 2003. ''English Language Bible Translators''. Jefferson, NC &amp; London: McFarland and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greber’s belief in spirit communication affected his translation clearly in 1 Corinthians 12:28, “...mediums who speak in various foreign languages’’.”&lt;ref&gt;p. 98. William Paul. 2003. ''English Language Bible Translators''. Jefferson, NC &amp; London: McFarland and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamboj Sikhs''' are an affluent farming subcaste of [[Sikh]]s.They form nearly 2%-3% of the population of the [[Indian state]] of [[Punjab]].

==History==
[[Sikh]] [[Kamboj]]s were converted from [[Hindu]] [[Kamboj]]s and [[Muslim]] [[Kamboj]]s. [[Hindu]] [[Kamboj]]s belong to the [[Kshatriya]] class according to [[varna]].During the [[Islamic]] rule in India, [[Kamboj]]s were considered noblest of all indians.

[[Kamboj]]s started following [[sikhism]] during the period of [[Guru Nanak]].[[Kamboj]]s are considered to be pure [[aryan]] stock.Some historians also claim them to be a royal clan of [[saka]]s.

==Army recruits==
During [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] rule in [[India]], [[kamboj]]s occupied key military and civil positions. The historian [[M. Athar Ali]] said that "The Kambohs and Sayyids among the Indians were specially favoured for high military and civil positions. 
Muhammad Umar writes: {{quote|The (Muslim) Kamboh distinguished themselves by their courage, generosity and high spirits. They were famous for their excellent manners and were particularly gifted with wisdom and nobility....In terms of social stratification, the Kambohs were counted among the Shaikhs&amp;nbsp;... Among the Indian Muslims, the Kambohs were regarded as the noblest of all. However, perhaps with a view to maintaining the purity of their descent, or because of pride of nobility, they confined their matrimonial relationships within their own groups and did not establish marriage connections with other Muslim groups including even the Saiyids and the Mughals. Some members of this clan like Shahbaz Khan Kamboh, Nawab Abu Muhammad Khan, Bahadur Khan and Nawab Khair Andesh Khan rose to high positions during the reign of Mughals.&lt;ref name="umar"&gt;Muslim Society in Northern India During the Eighteenth Century, 1998, pp 24, 25 Muhammad Umar&lt;/ref&gt;}}
During British rule in India, Sikh Kambojs were considered among the Royal Races of India.Sikh Kambojs also joined the [[Khalsa]] panth in large numbers.

==Agriculture==
Numerous foreign and Indian writers have described the modern [[Sikh]] Kambojs as some of the best agriculturists of India.Regardless of their small population in the [[Punjab]], [[Kamboj]]s own a large portion of agricultural land in the state.

The modern Kamboj are still found living chiefly by agriculture, business and military service which were the chief professions followed by their Kamboja ancestors some 2500 years ago as powerfully attested by Arthashastra[27] and Brhat Samhita.[28] Numerous foreign and Indian writers have described the modern Kambojs/Kambohs as one of the finest class of agriculturists of India.[29] British colonial writers such as H. A. Rose and Denzil Charles J. Ibbetson note the Kamboj and Ahir agriculturists as the first rank husbandmen and they rate them above the Jatts.[30] They occupy exactly the same position in general farming as the Ramgarhias occupy in general industry.

The Kambojs have made great contributions in agriculture and military fields. The majority of Krishi Pandit awards in 
India have been won by the Kamboj agriculturists[31] . Col Lal Singh Kamboj, a landlord from Uttar Pradesh, was the first Indian farmer to win the prestigious Padam Shri Award for progressive farming in 1968 from President of India. According to Dr M. S. Randhawa (Ex-Vice Chancellor, Punjab University), the Kamboj farmers have no equals in industry and tenacity.[32]&lt;ref&gt;India and World War 1, 1978, p 218, DeWitt C. Ellinwood, S. D. Pradhan; The Transformation of Sikh Society, 1974, p 132, Ethne K. Marenco&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Kamboj Sikhs==
* [[Akali Phula Singh]]
* [[Bhai Mani Singh]]
* [[Bhai Dayala]] 
* [[Bhai Aghar Singh]],known for killing Momim Khan(the biggest butcher of Sikhs in history) 
* Bhai [[Sukha Singh]]
* [[Baba Amar Singh Nibber]],leader of the [[Bandai]] [[Sikhs]].
* [[Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh Dhanju]]
* [[Udham Singh]]
* [[Bhagat Singh Thind]]
* [[Mahi Singh Sunam]]

'''Karaite Judaism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛər|ə|.|aɪ|t}}) or '''Karaism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛər|ə|.|ɪ|z|əm}}; {{Hebrew Name|{{Hebrew|יהדות קראית}}|Yahadut Qara'it from|Qārāʾîm|meaning "Readers"}}; also spelt '''Qaraite Judaism''' or '''Qaraism'''){{Efn | associated with ''Miqra'' ({{Hebrew|מקרא}}), the Jewish name for the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the [[Semitic root|root]] ''qara'' ({{Hebrew|קרא}}) meaning "to proclaim through reading".}} is a [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish religious movement]] characterized by the recognition of the [[Tanakh]] alone as its supreme [[religious text|authority]] in ''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish [[religious law]]) and [[theology]]. It is distinct from mainstream [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which considers the [[Oral Torah]], as codified in the [[Talmud]] and subsequent works, to be authoritative interpretations of the [[Torah]]. Karaites maintain that all of the [[Mitzvah|divine commandments]] handed down to [[Moses]] by God were recorded in the written Torah without additional Oral Law or explanation. As a result, Karaite Jews do not accept as binding the written collections of the oral tradition in the [[Midrash]] or [[Talmud]].

When interpreting the Tanakh, Karaites strive to adhere to the plain or most obvious meaning (''[[peshat]]'') of the text; this is not necessarily the literal meaning, but rather the meaning that would have been naturally understood by the ancient [[Israelites]] when the books of the Tanakh were first written. By contrast, Rabbinic Judaism relies on the legal rulings of the Sanhedrin as they are codified in the Midrash, Talmud, and other sources to indicate the authentic meaning of the Torah.{{Efn|This oral law employs the methods of ''remez'' (implication or clue), ''[[midrash|drash]]'' (interpretation, [[exegesis]]), and ''sod'' (deep, hidden meaning, identified with the [[Qabbalah]]).}} Karaite Judaism holds every interpretation of the Tanakh to the same scrutiny regardless of its source, and teaches that it is the personal responsibility of every individual Jew to study the [[Torah]], and ultimately decide personally its correct meaning. Karaites may consider arguments made in the Talmud and other works without exalting them above other viewpoints.

According to Rabbi [[Abraham ibn Daud]], in his ''Sefer HaQabbalah'', the Karaite movement crystallized in [[Baghdad]] in the [[Geonim|Gaonic period]] (''circa'' 7th–9th centuries) under the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in what is present-day [[Iraq]]. This is the view universally accepted among Rabbinic Jews. However, some Arab scholars claim that Karaites were already living in Egypt in the first half of the 7th century, based on a legal document that the Karaite community in Egypt had in its possession until the end of the 19th century, in which the first Islamic governor ordered the leaders of the Rabbinite community against interfering with Karaite practices or the way they celebrate their holidays. It was said to have been stamped by the palm of [['Amr ibn al-'As]], the first Islamic governor of Egypt, and was reportedly dated 20&amp;nbsp;[[Hijri year|AH]] (641&amp;nbsp;CE).&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Tahdhib'', No. 38, 5 Sept. 1902, p.&amp;nbsp;158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ash-Shubban Al-Qarra’in'' 4, 2 June 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;and Mourad El-Kodsi, ''The Karaite Jews of Egypt'', 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have argued over whether Karaism has a direct connection to anti-Rabbinic sects and views, such as those of the [[Sadducees]], dating back to the end of the [[Second Temple period]] (70&amp;nbsp;CE), or whether Karaism represents a novel emergence of similar views. Karaites have always maintained that, while there are some similarities to the Sadducees, due to the rejection of Rabbinical authority and the Oral Law, there are major differences. The ancestors of the Karaites were a group called ''Benei Ṣedeq'' during the [[Second Temple]] period.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see Mordekhai Ben-Nisan's ''Sefer Dod Mordekhai'' on the division of the House of Israel into two parts, [1699; first published in Vienna, 1830] republished in [[Ramla|Ramle, Israel]], 1966 by Ḥevrat Haṣlaḥah LiVnei Miqra’ (publishing house of the Karaite Jews of Israel).&lt;/ref&gt;

Karaites at one time made up a significant proportion of the Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Jacobs, ''The Year of Living Biblically'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the Karaite population are difficult to make because they believe on the basis of Genesis 32 that counting Jews is forbidden. In the 21st century, some 30,000–50,000 are thought to reside in Israel, with smaller communities in Turkey, Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isabel Kershner]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/world/middleeast/new-generation-of-jewish-sect-takes-up-struggle-to-protect-place-in-modern-israel.html?hp "New Generation of Jewish Sect Takes Up Struggle to Protect Place in Modern Israel"], ''[[The New York Times]],'' 4 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate holds that, of the 50,000 worldwide, more than 40,000 descend from those who made [[aliyah]] from [[Egypt]] and Iraq to [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Laying-down-the-Oral-law |author=Joshua Freeman |title=Laying down the (Oral) law |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Karaite community today resides in the Israeli city of [[Ashdod]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karaite.org.il/community/Ashdod Community of Ashdod]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:KaraiteSynnagogOldCity.jpg|thumb|The Karaite Synagogue in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)]]]]
Arguments amongst Jewish sects regarding the validity of the Oral Law can be dated back to the 1st and 2nd centuries BCE. Accordingly, some scholars trace the origin of Karaism to those who rejected the Talmudic tradition as an innovation. [[Judah Halevi]], an 11th-century Jewish philosopher and rabbi, wrote a defense for Judaism entitled ''[[Kuzari]]'', placing the origins of Karaism in the first and second centuries BCE, to the reign of [[Alexander Jannaeus]] ("King Jannai"):
{{Quote|After him came Judah b. Tabbāi and Simon b. Shētaḥ, with the friends of both. At this period arose the doctrine of the Karaites in consequence of an incident between the Sages and King Jannai who was a priest. His mother was under suspicion of being a 'profane' woman. One of the Sages alluded to this, saying to him: 'Be satisfied, O king Jannai, with the royal crown, but leave the priestly crown to the seed of Aaron.' His friends prejudiced him against the Sages, advising him to browbeat, expel, and scatter or kill them. He replied: 'If I destroy the Sages what will become of our Law?' 'There is the written law,' they replied, whoever wishes to study it may come and do so; take no heed of the oral law.' He followed their advice and expelled the Sages and among them Simon b. Shētaḥ, his son-in-law. Rabbinism was laid low for some time. The other party tried to establish a law built on their own conception, but failed, till Simon b. Shētaḥ returned with his disciples from Alexandria, and restored tradition to its former condition. Karaism had, however, taken root among people who rejected the oral law, and called all kinds of proofs to their aid, as we see to-day. As regards the Sādōcaeans and Boēthosians, they are the sectarians who are anathemised in our prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halevi|first1=Judah|title=Sefer Ha Kuzari|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/khz/khz03.htm|website=sacred-texts.com|accessdate=5 November 2015|ref=par. 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Abraham Geiger]], a 19th-century German scholar who founded Reform Judaism, posited a connection between the Karaites and a remnant of the [[Sadducees]], the 1st-century Jewish sect that followed the Hebrew Bible literally and rejected the [[Pharisees]]' notion of an Oral Torah even before it was written.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Abraham Geiger's Liberal Judaism: Personal Meaning and Religious Authority | first =  Ken | last = Koltun-Fromm | page =52 pub = Indiana University Press, | date = 3 Jul 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geiger's view is based on comparison between Karaite and Sadducee ''[[halakha]]'': for example, a minority in Karaite Judaism do not believe in a final resurrection or after-life, a position also held by the Sadducees. The British theologian [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]] (1767) noted, 
{{quote|In the times of [[John Hyrcanus]], and Alexander Janneus his son, sprung up the sect of the Karaites, in opposition to the Pharisees, who had introduced traditions, and set up the oral law, which these men rejected. In the times of the said princes lived Simeon ben Shetach, and Judah ben Tabbai, who flourished AM 3621, these two separated, the latter from the former, because he could not embrace his inventions which he formed out of his own brain; and from him the Karaites sprung, who were first called the society or congregation of Judah ben Tabbai, which was afterwards changed into the name of Karaites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language | first = John | last = Gill | work= A Collection of Sermons and Tracts...|pages = 538–42 | date=1778 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=59wOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA538}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gill also traces the Karaite sect to the split between the schools of [[Hillel the Elder]] and [[Shammai]] in 30&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, John. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=59wOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA536  A Collection of Sermons and Tracts...: To which are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Life, Writing, and Character of the Author, Volume 3]''. London: George Keith, 1778. pg= 529&lt;/ref&gt;

American scholar [[Bernard Revel]]  rejects many of Geiger's proofs in his 1913 published dissertation, ''The Karaite Halakah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sWtbAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=karaite&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Karaite Halakah: And Its Relation to Saduccean, Samaritan and ..|author=Revel, Bernard|date= 1913 |location=Philadelphia |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revel also points to the many correlations between Karaite halakha and theology and the interpretations of [[Philo]] of [[Alexandria]], the 1st-century philosopher and Jewish scholar. He also notes the writings of a 10th-century Karaite who refers to Philo's works, showing that the Karaites made use of Philo's writings in the development of their movement. Later Medieval Karaite commentators{{who|date=December 2014}} did not view Philo in a favorable light. These attitudes show a friction between later Karaite theology and possible connections to Philo's philosophy, which could serve as either a rejection of their origins, rejection of theological positions no longer accepted, or that Philo's philosophy was not entirely used in the founding of the Karaites (although some influences remain possible).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Early 20th-century scholars Oesterley and Box suggested that Karaism formed in a reaction to the rise of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Oesterley, W. O. E. &amp; Box, G. H. (1920) ''A Short Survey of the Literature of Rabbinical and Mediæval Judaism'', Burt Franklin: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The new religion recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith, but claimed that it detracted from its belief by deferring to rabbinical authority.

===9th century===
‘[[Anan ben David]] ({{lang-he|ענן בן דוד}}, c. 715&amp;nbsp;– 795 or 811?) is widely considered to be a major founder of the Karaite movement. His followers were called Ananites; they did not believe the Rabbinical oral law was divinely inspired.

According to a 12th-century Rabbanite account, in approximately 760, Shelomoh ben Ḥisdai II, the [[Exilarch]] in [[Babylon]] died, and two brothers among his nearest kin, ‘Anan ben David (whose name according to the Rabbanite account was ‘Anan ben Shafaṭ, but was called "ben David" due to his Davidic lineage) and Ḥananyah were next in order of succession. Eventually Ḥananyah was elected by the rabbis of the Babylonian Jewish colleges (the [[Geonim]]) and by the notables of the chief Jewish congregations, and the choice was confirmed by the Caliph of Baghdad.

A schism may have occurred, with ‘Anan ben David being proclaimed exilarch by his followers.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Qaraites |volume=22 |page=705 |first=Israel |last=Abrahams |inline=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all scholars agree that this event occurred. Leon Nemoy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nemoy, Leon |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nemoy-leon |website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes, "Natronai, scarcely ninety years after ‘Anan's secession, tells us nothing about his aristocratic (Davidic) descent or about the contest for the office of exilarch which allegedly served as the immediate cause of his apostasy."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;See ''Karaite Anthology''; Yale Judaica Series 7&lt;/ref&gt; Nemoy later notes that Natronai — a devout Rabbanite — lived where ‘Anan's activities took place, and that the Karaite sage [[Jacob Qirqisani]] never mentioned ‘Anan's purported lineage or candidacy for Exilarch.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Anan's allowing his followers to proclaim him as Exilarch was considered treason by the Muslim government.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} He was sentenced to death, but his life was saved by his fellow prisoner, [[Abu Hanifa]], the founder of the [[madhhab]] or school of [[fiqh]] (Muslim jurisprudence) known as the [[Hanafi]]. Ultimately he and his followers were permitted to migrate to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. They erected a synagogue in Jerusalem that continued to be maintained until the time of the [[Crusades]]. From this center, the sect diffused thinly over Syria, spread into Egypt, and ultimately reached [[Southeast Europe]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

Ben David challenged the Rabbanite establishment. Some scholars believe that his followers may have absorbed Jewish Babylonian sects such as the Isunians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yaron|first=Yoseif|title=The Second Diaspora|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/uc/uc_sects_c.htm|work=A Brief History of Jewish Sects|publisher=Judaism.about.com|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (followers of [[Abu Isa]]), Yudghanites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yudganhites|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/15131-yudghanites|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the remnants of the pre-Talmudic [[Sadducees]] and [[Boethusians]]. Later, sects such as the Ukbarites emerged separately from the Ananites.

However, the Isunians, Yudghanites, ‘Ukabarites, and Mishawites all held views that did not accord with those of either the ‘Ananites or the Karaites. Abu ‘Isa al-Isfahani, who was an illiterate tailor, claimed to be a prophet, prohibited divorce, claimed that all months should have thirty days, believed in Jesus and Muhammad as prophets, and told his followers that they must study the [[New Testament]] and the [[Qur’an]]. Yudghan was a follower of ‘Isa al-Isfahani and claimed to be a prophet and the Messiah, saying that the observance of Shabbat and Holy Days was no longer obligatory. Isma‘il al-‘Ukbari believed he was the prophet [[Elijah]], and hated ‘Anan. Mishawayh al-‘Ukbari, who was a disciple of Isma‘il al-‘Ukbari and the founder of the Mishawites, taught his followers to use a purely solar calendar of 364 days and 30-day months, insisting that all the Holy Days and fast days should always occur on fixed days in the week, rather than on fixed days of the months. He further said that [[Shabbat]] should be kept from sunrise on Saturday to sunrise on Sunday. Most ‘Ananites and Karaites rejected such beliefs.

‘Anan developed his movement's core tenets. His ''Sefer HaMiṣwot'' ("The Book of the Commandments") was published about 770. He adopted many principles and opinions of other anti-rabbinic forms of Judaism that had previously existed. He took much from the old Sadducees and Essenes, whose remnants still survived, and whose writings—or at least writings ascribed to them—were still in circulation. Thus, for example, these older sects prohibited the burning of any lights and the leaving of one's dwelling on the Sabbath. Unlike the Sadducees, ‘Anan and the [[Qumran]] sectaries allowed persons to leave their house, but prohibited leaving one's town or camp. ‘Anan said that one should not leave one's house for frivolous things, but only to go to prayer or to study scripture. The Sadducees required the observation of the new moon to establish the dates of festivals and always held the [[Shavuot]] festival on a Sunday.

===The Golden Age===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
In the "Golden Age of Karaism" (900–1100) a large number of Karaite works were produced in all parts of the Muslim world. Karaite Jews were able to obtain autonomy from Rabbinite Judaism in the Muslim world and establish their own institutions. Karaites in the Muslim world also obtained high social positions such as tax collectors, doctors, and clerks, and even received special positions in the Egyptian courts. Karaite scholars were among the most conspicuous practitioners in the philosophical school known as [[Jewish Kalam]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

According to historian [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]], at one time the number of Jews affiliating with Karaism was as much as 40 percent of world Jewry, and debates between Rabbinist and Karaite leaders were not uncommon.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Most notable among the opposition to Karaite thought and practice at this time are the writings of Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]], which eventually led to a permanent split between some Karaite and Rabbinite communities.

===Karaites in the Russian Empire===
{{Main article|Crimean Karaites}}
[[File:Trakai Kenesa.JPG|thumb|Karaim [[kenesa]] in [[Trakai]].]]
During the late 19th century, Russian authorities began to differentiate Karaite Jews from Rabbinite Jews, freeing them from various [[Antisemitism in the Russian Empire|oppressive laws]] that affected Rabbinic Jews. The Tsarist governor  of the [[Taurida Governorate]], [[Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov]], told the Karaite leaders that, even though the [[Russian Empire]] liked the idea that the Karaites did not accept the [[Talmud]], they were still Jews and responsible for the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] and thus subject to the laws. The leaders, hearing that, devised a ruse by which they could be freed of the oppressive laws and told him that the Karaites had already settled in the Crimea before the death of Jesus. The Tsarist government then said that, if they could prove it, they would be free of the oppressive laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9211-karaites-and-karaism Karaites//Jewish Enciclpedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The community leaders charged [[Abraham Firkovich]] (1786-1874) with gathering anything that could help show that Karaites were not in Jerusalem at the time of [[Jesus]], and thus not responsible for the crucifixion. Through his work, Firkovich helped establish the idea among the Russian authorities that the Karaites, as descendants of the exiled northern kingdom of Israel,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} had already gone into  exile centuries before the death of Jesus and thus had no responsibility for it. Firkovich referenced tombstones in Crimea (altering the dates) and gathered thousands of Karaite, Rabbinic, and [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] manuscripts, including one Rabbinic document from [[Transcaucasia]] that claims that the Jews there were descendants of the exiles from the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;

These actions convinced the [[Tsar]] that Karaite ancestors could not have killed Jesus and that thus their descendants were free of [[blood curse|familial guilt]].

Despite this, within the community [[Hakham|Ḥakhamim]] still taught that the Karaites were and had always been a part of the Jewish people; prayer was in Hebrew, the lineage of [[Kohen]]s, [[Levite]]s, and families of Davidic descent were meticulously preserved,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and books printed in Hebrew adamantly identified the Karaites as Jews.

In 1897 the Russian census counted 12,894 Karaites in the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, most European Karaites were no longer very knowledgeable about the religion and [[Seraya Shapshal]], a Karaite soldier of fortune{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} who had been the tutor of the last [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Shah of Persia, [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar]] and a Russian spy, managed about 1911 to get himself elected Chief Ḥakham of the Karaites in the Russian Empire (by that time, due to Russian regulations, the position had become more of a political one than a spiritual one). Influenced by the Pan-Turkic movement in Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;See Dan Shapira's work on the subject{{which|date=January 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shapshal made his position into that of an Emperor-priest. He changed the title Hakham to "Ḥakhan" (a cross between the Turkic titles [[khagan]] and [[Khan (title)|khan]]), forbade the use of Hebrew, and in the 1930s introduced pagan elements (such as the veneration of sacred oak trees in the cemetery).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He recognized both Jesus and Muhammad as prophets (thus appeasing both the Russian Orthodox Tsarist government and the Muslim Turkic peoples).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, [[atheism]] became official state policy in Soviet territories and Karaite religious schools and places of worship were the very first religious institutions closed by the Soviet government.{{Citation needed|reason= The source at the end of the paragraph does not support this. |date=November 2016}} The authorities allowed only the teaching of Shapshalian doctrines about the Karaites, and the official stance according to Soviet law (carried over from Russian Imperial law) erroneously regarded the Karaites as Turkic descendants of the [[Khazars]] and not as Jews.&lt;ref&gt;

Not all European Karaites accepted the Shapshalian doctrines. Some Hachamim and a small part of the general Karaite population still preserved their Jewish heritage, but most{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} dared not oppose Shapshal openly due to his official standing with regard to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/History/Tiro.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six-Day War===
All Jewish men in Egypt were placed in camps during the [[Six-Day War]], and they were kept there for up to three years; Karaites were among the last to leave; most of Egypt's Karaite Jews settled in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By David A.M.

==Beliefs==
Karaites believe they observe the original religion of Ancient Israel, as prescribed by [[God]] in the Tanakh and understood by the Israelites before the Pharisaic period. They do not accept later additions, such as the Talmud of Rabbinic Judaism, as divinely inspired. They place the ultimate responsibility of interpreting the Tanakh on each individual. Karaism holds every interpretation up to the same objective scrutiny regardless of its source.

Karaites believe in one, eternal, omnipresent, incorporeal, and almighty God, Creator of the Universe, who gave the Tanakh to the Israelites through Moses and the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. Karaites trust in [[Divine providence in Judaism|Divine providence]], and the majority hope for the coming of the [[Messiah]].

===Views on the Mishnah===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{see also|Criticism of the Talmud}}
Karaites do not accept the existence of an Oral Law because:
# The Mishnah quotes many conflicting opinions.
# The Mishnah does not define in which opinion the truth lies. Rather, the Mishnah sometimes agrees with neither one nor the other, contradicting both.
# They argue that the truth of the oral law given to Moses could only be in one opinion, not many opinions.
# They question why the Mishnah does not solely speak in the name of Moses.
# They say that Oral Law is not explicitly mentioned in the Tanakh.
# When God told Moses to come up to Mount Sinai to receive the Torah He said, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there: and I will give you tablets of stone, and a law, and commandments ''that I have written''"; (Ex 24:12). The text states the commands are written, and no mention is made of an Oral Law.
# The Tanakh reports that the written Torah was both lost and completely forgotten for over 50 years and only rediscovered by the Temple priests (2Ki 22:8; 2Chr 34:15). It is inconceivable that an Oral Law could have been remembered when the written Law was forgotten.
# The words of the Mishnah and Talmud are the words of people living in the 2nd–5th centuries CE, in contrast to the Torah, which is held to be a direct revelation by God through Moses.
# The Torah states, "You shall not add to the word that I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of YHVH, your God, which I command you." (Deut 4:2) They argue that this excludes the possibility of later interpretation being viewed as divinely ordained.
#Joshua 8:34–35 states:
&lt;blockquote&gt; וְאַחֲרֵי־כֵן, קָרָא אֶת־כָּל־דִּבְרֵי הַתּוֹרָה, הַבְּרָכָה, וְהַקְּלָלָה—כְּכָל־הַכָּתוּב, בְּסֵפֶר הַתּוֹרָה.לֹא־הָיָה דָבָר, מִכֹּל אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּה מֹשֶׁה—אֲשֶׁר לֹא־קָרָא יְהוֹשֻׁעַ, נֶגֶד כָּל־קְהַל יִשְׂרָאֵל וְהַנָּשִׁים וְהַטַּף, וְהַגֵּר, הַהֹלֵךְ בְּקִרְבָּם.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After that, he [Joshua] read all the words of the Torah, the Blessing and the Curse, according to all that is written in the Torah scroll. There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that walked among them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since Joshua read from the Torah every word Moses had written, this implies that Moses had not been given an Oral Law, since Joshua could not have ''read'' an Oral Law from the written Torah. Secondly, there could not have been additional commandments outside of the written Torah, since all the commandments that existed could be read from the Torah scroll.

In addition to this, Joshua 1:8 states:
"This book of the law is not to depart out of your mouth, but you are to meditate on it day and night, so that you may observe to do according to all that is ''written'' in it."

===Karaite interpretations of the Torah===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Karaite Jews do not object to the idea of a body of interpretation of the Torah, along with extensions and development of non-Rabbinic ''Halakha'' (Jewish law) that strives to adhere to the Tanakh's straightforward meaning. Several hundred such books have been written by various Karaite [[Hakham|Ḥakhamim]] (sages) throughout the movement's history, although most are lost today. The disagreement arises over the Rabbinic tradition's raising of the Talmud and the other writings of the Rabbis above the Torah. The Karaites believe this has led to traditions and customs being kept under Rabbinic law that contradict what is written in the Torah. The Karaites also have their own traditions and customs passed down from their ancestors and religious authorities. These are known as ''Sevel HaYerushah'', which means "the Yoke [or burden] of Inheritance." Most of these practices are kept primarily by traditional Karaites; theoretically, any tradition thereof is said to be rejected if it contradicts the simple meaning of the Tanakh's Text. The vast majority of these traditions are not forced upon any Karaite Jew or convert to Judaism through the Karaite movement, except very few such as donning a head covering in the Karaite synagogues (except the synagogue in Hedgesville, West Virginia).

Those Karaites who are new to the Karaite lifestyle do not have such an inheritance or tradition and tend to rely heavily upon just the Tanakh and those practices mentioned in it, and to adapt Biblical practices to their cultural context. Karaite communities are so small and generally isolated, that their members commonly adopt the customs of their host country. In Israel, too, traditional Karaites tend to be culturally assimilated into mainstream society (both secular and [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]).

Many modern Karaite Jews have emerged from the Karaite revival of the late 20th century; the [[World Karaite Movement]] was founded by Nehemia Gordon and Ḥakham [[Meir Rekhavi]] in the early 1990s. [[Karaite Jewish University]] (KJU), approved by the Mo‘eṣet HaḤakhamim (the Council of Sages) in Israel, was founded to teach an introductory course on Karaite Judaism. It could lead to a student's conversion by a ''Beit Din'' (religious Jewish court) authorized by the Mo‘eṣet HaḤakhamim. KJU teaches various forms of Karaite Judaism and includes ''Sevel HaYerushah'' in its course materials. Thus, newly admitted converts to Karaite Judaism can choose to accept or reject Sevel HaYerushah.

Karaites (at least in [[Trakai]], [[Lithuania]]) no longer follow Biblical dictates for animal sacrifices during holidays.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Communication with Yuri Spakovski, President of Trakai's Karaim Society (June, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The calendar===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{See also|Hebrew calendar}}

Karaites use the observational form of the [[Hebrew calendar]] used by Jews in the [[Land of Israel]] until at least the end of the [[Second Temple]] period. Under that system, a new month ([[Rosh Chodesh]]) commences with the observation of a [[new moon]] in Israel. The start of a new year in the first biblical month is based upon the observation of the agricultural stage of ripeness of the [[barley]] (called the ''Aviv'' stage). Before quick worldwide communication was available, Karaites in the [[Diaspora]] used a calculated form of the Hebrew calendar similar to, yet different from, that used by Jews in general, for convenience. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Karaites of [[Trakai]] follow a "movable Shabbat" based on a lunar calendar that accommodates holidays and fast days - one might be on a Thursday and the next on a Sunday.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Shabbat===
As with other Jews, during [[Shabbat]], Karaites attend [[synagogue]]s to worship and to offer [[Jewish prayers|prayers]]. Most Karaites refrain from sexual relations on that day since they maintain that engaging in them can cause fatigue and copulation, in particular, results in ritual impurity on this holy day, concerns that Rabbinic Judaism ceased to have long ago; additionally, impregnating one's wife is considered ''melakha'' (forbidden work). Their prayer books are composed almost completely of Biblical passages. Karaite Jews often practice full prostration during prayers, while most other Jews no longer pray in this fashion.

Unlike Rabbinic Jews, Karaites do not practice the ritual of lighting [[Shabbat candles]]. They have a differing interpretation of the Torah verse, "You shall not [burn] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''bi‘er'' the [[Biblical Hebrew#Grammar|''pi‘el'']] form of ''ba‘ar'') a fire in any of your dwellings on the day of Shabbat." In Rabbinic Judaism, the ''qal'' verb form ''ba‘ar'' is understood to mean "burn", whereas the ''pi‘el'' form (present here) is understood to be, not intensive as usual but causative, the rule being that the pi‘el of a stative verb will be causative, instead of the usual hif‘il. Hence ''bi‘er'' means "kindle", which is why Rabbinic Judaism prohibits ''starting'' a fire on Shabbat. The vast majority of Karaite Jews hold that, throughout the Tanakh, ''ba‘ar'' explicitly means "to burn", while the Hebrew word meaning "to ignite" or "to kindle" is ''hidliq''. Accordingly, the mainstream in Karaite Judaism takes the passage to mean that fire should not be left burning in a Jewish home on Shabbat, regardless of whether it was lit prior to, or during the Sabbath. However, the minority of Karaites who view the prohibition to be on kindling a fire often permit a fire to continue burning into the Sabbath.

Historically, Karaites refrained from using or deriving benefit from fire until the Sabbath ends, and accordingly their homes were not lit during the night of the Sabbath. Many modern Karaites today use a [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] or [[LED lamp]] powered by batteries, which is turned on prior to Shabbat. Many observant Karaites either unplug their refrigerators on Shabbat or turn off the circuit breakers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Karaites consider [[electricity on Shabbat|producing electricity to be a violation of Shabbat]], no matter who produces it. Additionally, some Karaites view the purchasing of electricity that is charged on an incremental basis during the Shabbat as a commercial transaction that the Tanakh prohibits, no matter when the payment is made; the recording of the electric meter is considered by them to be a commercial transaction.

===Laws of ritual purity===
Karaites maintain that in the absence of a [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], ordinary washing with flowing waters (described in the Torah as "living"—flowing—water) should be substituted for purification with water that includes ashes obtained through the [[red heifer]] burning ritual. Karaites believe that this was the practice before the [[Tabernacle]] was built in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] following [[the Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;Vayyiqra (Leviticus) 22:6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Yaron|first1=Y.|first2=Joe |last2=Pessah, |first3=Avraham |last3=Qanaï |author3-link=Avraham Qanaï|first4=Yosef |last4=El-Gamil|title=An Introduction to Karaite Judaism: History, Theology, Practice and Culture|publisher=Qirqisani Center|year=2003|location=[[Albany, New York]]|isbn=978-0-9700775-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They follow certain Torah laws for avoiding ''Ṭum’at Met'' (ritual impurity caused by contact with a dead body, human bones, graves, or being present in a space under any ceiling where a human died)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ou.org/torah/tt/5765/tazria65/mikdash.htm | title = The Lower Levels of Impurity – the Zav | accessdate = 2011-03-27 | last = Sugarman | first = Catriel | work = The Torah Tidbits Archive | publisher = The Seymour J.

===Sephirath Ha‘Omer and Shavu‘oth===
The Karaite method of [[Counting of the Omer|counting the days from the offering of the ‘Omer]] is different from the Rabbinic method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karaite-korner.org/omer.shtml Counting the Omer – סְפִירַת הָעֹמֶר]&lt;/ref&gt; The Karaites understand the term "morrow after the Sabbath" in Leviticus 23:15–16 to refer to the weekly Sabbath, whereas Rabbinic Judaism interprets it as referring to the day of rest on the first day of [[Passover|Ḥagh HaMaṣṣot]]. So while Rabbinic Judaism begins the count on the 16th of [[Nisan]] and celebrates Shavu‘ot on the 6th of [[Sivan]], Karaite Jews count from the day after the weekly Sabbath (i.e., the Sunday) that occurs during the seven days of Ḥagh HaMaṣṣot to the day after the seventh weekly Sabbath. They celebrate Shavu‘ot on that Sunday, no matter what the calendar date of that Sunday on which it happens to fall.

===Tzitzit (Ṣiṣiyot)===
[[File:Karaite Tsitsit.jpg|right|thumb|A karaite Ṣiṣit with blue threads]]
A [[Tzitzit]] (alternatively spelled Ṣiṣit, plural: Tzitziyot or Ṣiṣiyot) is a knotted or braided tassel worn by observant Jews (both Karaite and Rabbinic) on each of the four corners of what is often an outer garment or their [[Tallit]]. The [[Torah]] commands Israel to make tassels on the corners of their four-cornered garment containing a thread of ''[[Tekhelet]]'' ({{bibleverse-lb||Numbers|15:38|HE}}) and repeats this commandment using the word for "twisted cords" ("Gedilim") instead of "tassels" at {{bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|22:12|HE}}. The purpose of the tassels is stated in the Book of Numbers as a visual reminder to the Israelites to remember the commandments given by God.

The thread of Tekhelet is a blue-violet or blue thread, which, according to the traditions of Rabbinic Judaism, is to be dyed with a specific kind of dye derived from a [[Mollusca|mollusc]] (notably the ''[[Hexaplex trunculus]]'' sea snail). Due to a number of factors, including Rome outlawing the use of Tekhelet by commoners, the source and practice of using a Tekhelet thread in Tzitzit was lost for most Rabbinic Jews. Their Tzitziyot are usually all white. Karaite Jews believe that the importance of Tekhelet is that the color of thread is blue-violet and it may be produced from any source, including synthetic industrial dyes, except impure (a state mostly overlapping [[kashrut|unkosher]]) marine creatures, rather than insist on a specific dye. Therefore, they believe that the Rabbinic tradition of relying on a dye from a mollusc is incorrect. They suggest that the source of the dye was [[Indigofera|indigo]] or ''[[Isatis tinctoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rekhavi.karaitejudaism.org/sisit.shtml Hakham Meir Yosef Rekhavi, "They Shall Make for Themselves Sisith (Fringe/Tassel)"], Kharaite Judasim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curtisdward.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/what-is-the-true-tekhelet/ Dr. Curtis D. Ward, "What is the True Tekhelet?"], 5 January 2011, Ward blog&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinic Jews have specific traditions on how the tassels are to be knotted. Karaite Jews, for their part, have certain traditions on the manner of braiding the tassels, although they are not binding. Consequently, the way the Tzitziyot are made usually distinguishes Karaite Tzitziyot from Rabbinic Tzitziyot.

===Tefillin===
Karaite Jews do not wear [[tefillin]] in any form. According to Karaites, the Biblical passages cited for this practice are metaphorical, and mean to "remember the Torah always and treasure it". This is because the commandment in scripture is "And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart"… "And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for forehead ornaments between thine eyes". (Deuteronomy 6:5,9) Since words cannot be on one's heart, or bound on one's hand, the entire passage is understood metaphorically.&lt;ref name=jpost /&gt; Furthermore, the same expressions ("And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand" as well as "and they shall be as frontal ornaments between thine eyes") are used in Exodus 13:9 in reference to the commandments of Ḥagh HaMaṣṣot, in Exodus 13:16 in reference to the ritual of redeeming the first born, in Deuteronomy 6:8 in reference to the ‘Aseret HaDevarim (the Ten Utterances, usually mistranslated as "the Ten Commandments"), and in Deuteronomy 11:18 in reference to all the words of the Torah, indicating that, from a Karaite perspective, they must be metaphorical in nature (because one could never ritually "write" and "bind" upon their hearts themselves).

===Mezuzot===
Like Tefillin, Karaites interpret the scripture that mandates inscribing the Law on doorposts and city gates as a metaphorical admonition, specifically, to keep the Law at home and away. This is because the previous commandment in the same passage is the source for Tefillin for Rabbinic Judaism, and is understood metaphorically due to the language. As a result, the entire passage is understood as a metaphor. Therefore, they do not put up [[mezuzah|mezuzot]], although many Karaite Jews do have a small plaque with the [[Ten Commandments]] on their doorposts.

However, a Christian account in the 19th century tells of a Karaite synagogue in Constantinople that reportedly had a [[mezuzah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/narrativeamissi00chegoog|title=Narrative of a Mission of Inquiry to the Jews from the Church of Scotland in 1839|last=Bonar|first=Andrew Alexander|last2=M'Cheyne|first2=Robert Murray|publisher=Whyte|year=1849|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=361|author-link=Andrew Bonar|author-link2=Robert Murray M'Cheyne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, in an effort to make Rabbinic Jews comfortable, many Karaite Jews do put up mezuzot, but not out of belief that it is commanded.

===Mamzerim===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
In both Deuteronomy 23:3, and Zechariah 9:6, the Hebrew word ''mamzer'' is referenced alongside the nations of Ammon and Moab (in Deut 23:3), and the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod (in Zech 9:5–6). From such, Karaites have come to consider the most logical understanding of the Hebrew word ''mamzer'', which modern Rabbinical Jews understand to refer to either children born from adultery or from incest (Talmud Bavli, Masekhet Yevamot), to actually speak of a nation or people. Karaites think that such an understanding fits perfectly into the context of both Deuteronomy 23 and Zechariah 9, (and this was also the understanding of the Rabbinist commentator Yehudah ben Shemu’el ibn Bil‘am). Several Medieval Rabbinite Jewish sages felt it necessary to debate this topic with Medieval Karaite Jewish sages.

===Four species===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Karaite Judaism defines the [[Four species|Arba`at haMinim]] somewhat differently than Rabbinic Jews, i.e. (1) fruit of splendorous tree (''Peri `Eṣ Hadar''), which need not be the [[Etrog]] (yellow Citrus fruit) demanded by Rabbinic law, yet may be either any seasonal fruit tree considered splendorous by an individual Jew, or branches of olive trees featuring the olives, that were considered splendorous by the Judean Israelites in the generation of [[Nehemiah]], as seen in Neḥemyah 8; (2) date palm fronds (''Kappoth Temarim'') instead of the closed palm frond used by Rabbinical Jews; (3) branches of thickly leaved trees (''‘Eṣ ‘Avoth'') which may be from fig, laurel and Eucalyptus rather than myrtle branches only; and (4) [[willow]] branches (''‘Aravoth Naḥal'') e.g. Maple, Oak, Yew and Butternut, as opposed to the Rabbinically dictated willow tree's boughs. Karaite Jews have always understood the ''Arba`at haMinim'' to be used for the purpose of constructing the roof of the [[Sukkah]] (pl. ''Sukkot''); they are not made into a [[lulav]] and shaken in six directions, as is the Rabbinic practice. In the book of Nehemiah (8:15), the Israelites are instructed to construct their Sukkot out of the four species: olive branches and oil tree branches (fruit of splendorous tree), as well as date palm fronds, myrtle branches and branches of thickly leaved trees are mentioned in the same passage as materials for the Sukkah's construction.

Nehemiah 8:14–15
{{lang|he|וַיִּמְצְאוּ, כָּתוּב בַּתּוֹרָה: אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה יהוה בְּיַד-מֹשֶׁה, אֲשֶׁר יֵשְׁבוּ בְנֵי-יִשְׂרָאֵל בַּסֻּכּוֹת בֶּחָג בַּחֹדֶשׁ הַשְׁבִיעִי. וַאֲשֶׁר יַשְׁמִיעוּ, וְיַעֲבִירוּ קוֹל בְּכָל-עָרֵיהֶם וּבִירוּשָׁלִַם לֵאמֹר—צְאוּ הָהָר וְהָבִיאוּ עֲלֵי-זַיִת וַעֲלֵי-עֵץ שֶׁמֶן, וַעֲלֵי הֲדַס וַעֲלֵי תְמָרִים וַעֲלֵי עֵץ עָבֹת: לַעֲשֹׂת סֻכֹּת, כַּכָּתוּב.}}

''And they found written in the Torah, how YHWH had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in Sukkot in the feast of the seventh month; and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: 'Go forth into the mountains, and fetch olive branches, and oil tree branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thickly leaved trees, to '''make''' Sukkot, as it is written.''

===Who is a Jew?===
{{See also|Matrilineality in Judaism}}
Karaite Judaism follows [[patrilineal]] descent, meaning a Jew is someone whose father is Jewish, or who has undergone a formal conversion, since almost all Jewish descent in the [[Tanakh]] is traced patrilineally.

However, anyone who formally accepts the God of Israel as their own God, the people of Israel as their own people, and is circumcised (males only), is a fully established member of the people of Israel (Jew); Karaites believe this should be done after living among Karaite Jews and studying the Tanakh in the form of a vow (the dominant position among modern Karaites maintains that this oath should be taken before a Karaite Beit Din whose members act on the behalf of the Israeli Council of Sages), see Exodus 12:43–49, Ruth 1:16, Esther 8:17, and Isaiah 56:6–7; also [[Ezekiel]] the prophet states that Sojourners ("resident aliens" or "strangers") who have joined themselves to the Children of Israel will be given land inheritance among the Tribes of Israel among whom they live during the final redemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:21-2317|HE}}
וְחִלַּקְתֶּם אֶת-הָאָרֶץ הַזֹּאת לָכֶם—לְשִׁבְטֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל. וְהָיָה תַּפִּלוּ אוֹתָהּ בְּנַחֲלָה לָכֶם וּלְהַגֵּרִים הַגָּרִים בְּתוֹכְכֶם אֲשֶׁר-הוֹלִדוּ בָנִים בְּתוֹכְכֶם וְהָיוּ לָכֶם כְּאֶזְרָח בִּבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אִתְּכֶם יִפְּלוּ בְנַחֲלָה בְּתוֹךְ שִׁבְטֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל. וְהָיָה בַשֵּׁבֶט אֲשֶׁר-גָּר הַגֵּר אִתּוֹ שָׁם תִּתְּנוּ נַחֲלָתוֹ נְאֻם אֲדֹנָי יהוה So shall you divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel. And it shall be that you divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the resident aliens who sojourn in your midst and who bear children among you. And they shall be to you as native-born among the Children of Israel—with you they have an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel. And it shall be that in whatever tribe the resident alien sojourns, there you shall give him his inheritance," declares the Lord YHWH.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouncing the Tetragrammaton===
Some, such as the Karaites Jews in Khorasan (Persia) viewed it in Medieval times as a [[Mitzvah]] to do so because the name appears some 6800 times throughout the Tanakh (Old Testament).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Pseudo-Qumisian Sermon to the Karaites|year=1976|journal=American Academy for Jewish Research|volume=XLIII|pages=49–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, publicly uttering the [[Tetragrammaton]] (4 letter name) of God in Hebrew is a controversial issue among Karaites and indeed all Jews. Virtually all traditional Karaites view the pronunciation of God's name to be blasphemous, and adhere to the Rabbinic tradition of substituting "[[Adonai]]", when coming across [[YHWH|YHVH]] while reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Pseudo-Qumisian Sermon to the Karaites | journal = American Academy for Jewish Research | volume = XLIII | year = 1976 | pages = 49–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Karaites and some of those coming from a Rabbinic background like Nehemia Gordon and Ḥakham Meir Rekhavi, as well as some joiners to the people of Israel through Karaite Judaism such as James Walker and Daniel ben Immanuel, do not consider the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton to be forbidden. Although, there is disagreement among scholars as to the correct pronunciation.

==Writings==
&lt;!-- Image with questionable fair-use claim removed: [[File:karaite_stamp.jpg|right|framed|An Israeli Stamp featuring the Karaite Jews.]] --&gt;

Karaism has produced a vast library of commentaries and polemics, especially during its "Golden Age". These writings prompted new and complete defenses of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]], the culmination of these in the writings of [[Saadia Gaon]] and his criticisms of Karaism. Though he opposed Karaism, the Rabbinic commentator [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] regularly quoted Karaite commentators, particularly [[Yefet ben ‘Eli]], to the degree that a legend exists among some Karaites{{who|date=December 2014}} that Ibn Ezra was ben ‘Eli's student.

The most well-known Karaite polemic is [[Isaac_of_Troki|Yiṣḥaq ben Avraham of Troki]]'s "Faith Strengthened" ({{hebrew|חזוק אמונה}}), a comprehensive [[Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews|counter-Christian missionary polemic]], which was later translated into [[Latin]] by [[Johann Christoph Wagenseil]] as part of a larger collection of Jewish anti-Christian polemics entitled ''Tela Ignea Satanæ, sive Arcani et Horribiles Judæorum Adversus Christum, Deum, et Christianam Religionem Libri'' (Altdorf, 1681: "The Fiery Darts of Satan, or the Arcane and Horrible Books of the Jews Against Christ, God, and the Christian Religion"). Many counter-missionary materials produced today are based upon or cover the same themes as this book.

Scholarly studies of Karaite writings are still in their infancy, and owe greatly to the Firkovich collections of Karaite manuscripts in the [[National Library of Russia]] that have become accessible after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The cataloguing efforts of scholars at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] and in the United States and England is continuing to yield new insights into Karaite literature and thought.

==Karaites, Aharon Ben Mosheh Ben Asher, and the Masoretic text==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
[[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]] was a Jewish scholar from [[Tiberias]], famous as the most authoritative of the Tiberian Masoretes, and a member of a family who had been involved in creating and maintaining the [[Masoretic Text]] (authoritative text of the Hebrew scripture), for at least five generations. His [[Tiberian vocalization]] of the Bible is still, for all intents and purposes, the text all [[Jews]] continue to use, and he was the first systematic Hebrew grammarian.

His ''Sefer Diqduqei HaTe‘amim'' ("Grammar of the Punctuation/Vocalizations") was an original collection of grammatical rules and Masoretic information. Grammatical principles were not at that time considered worthy of independent study. The value of this work is that the grammatical rules presented by ben Asher reveal the linguistic background of vocalization for the first time. He had a tremendous influence on the world of [[Biblical criticism]].

In the nineteenth century, certain scholars suggested that Aharon Ben Asher might have been a Karaite and not a rabbinic Jew. Aharon Dothan has examined this issue from many angles, and his conclusion is that Ben Asher was a rabbinic Jew, but Raphael Zer has raised this issue again and presented new evidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aleppocodex.org/links/8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 989, an unknown scribe of a former ''[[Nevi'im]]'' manuscript vouched for the care with which his copy was written by claiming that he had vocalized and added the Masoretic text "from the books that were vocalized by Aaron ben Moses Ben-Asher". [[Maimonides]], by accepting the views of ben Asher in regard to open and closed sections, helped establish and spread his authority. Referring to a [[Bible]] manuscript then in Egypt, he wrote: "All relied on it, since it was corrected by Ben-Asher and was worked on and analyzed by him for many years, and was proofread many times in accordance with the masorah, and I based myself on this manuscript in the [[Sefer Torah]] that I wrote".

During the early 1920s a British mandate official in Jerusalem records visiting the Karaite synagogue, which he describes as being "small, mediaeval, semi-underground" serving "Jerusalem's tiny colony of Qaraites".&lt;ref&gt;Luke, Sir Harry (1953) ''Cities and Men. An Autobiography. Volume II. Aegean, Cyprus, Turkey, Transcaucasia &amp; Palestine. (1914–1924)''. Geoffrey Bles. London. p.245&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] originally objected to the immigration of Karaite Jews to Israel, and unsuccessfully tried to obstruct it. In 2007, however, Rabbi David Ḥayim Chelouche, the chief rabbi of Netayana was quoted in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' as saying, "A Karaite is a Jew. We accept them as Jews and every one of them who wishes to come back [to mainstream Judaism] we accept back. There was once a question about whether Karaites needed to undergo a token circumcision in order to switch to rabbinic Judaism, but the rabbinate agrees that today that is not necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Joshua. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/1281738481.html?dids=1281738481:1281738481&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+22%2C+2007&amp;author=JOSHUA+FREEMAN&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=14&amp;desc=Laying+down+the+(Oral)+law "Laying down the (Oral) law"].

[[Moshe Marzouk]], one of the Egyptian Jews executed in 1954 for planting bombs in Cairo in the service of Israeli Military Intelligence (the [[Lavon Affair]]) was a Karaite. Marzouk was considered a hero in Israel; however, his Karaite identity was downplayed in newspapers, which usually just described him as an Egyptian Jew. However, in 2001, the Israeli government, through the Israel Postal Authority, issued a special memorial sheet honoring him and many other Karaite Jews that gave their lives for Israel.

In Israel, the Karaite Jewish leadership is directed by a group called Universal Karaite Judaism. Most of the members of its Board of Ḥakhamim are of Egyptian Jewish descent. The largest Karaite community today resides in [[Ashdod]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karaite.org.il/community/Ashdod Community of Ashdod]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Karaite synagogue cali.jpg|right|thumb|192px|Karaite Synagogue Congregation B’nai Israel (Daly City, California)]]
There are about 4,000 Karaites living in the United States. The [[Congregation B'nai Israel (Daly City, California)|Congregation B'nai Israel]] is located in [[Daly City, California]], which is a suburb of San Francisco. It is the only Karaite synagogue in the United States with a permanent dedicated facility. The leaders of the congregation are of Egyptian Karaite extraction. One notable congregant, Mark Kheder, the Synagogue's treasurer, has described his internment in an Egyptian prisoner of war camp during the 1967 Six-Day war. The congregation's acting Rav (Ḥakham), Joe Pessah, was also among those who were arrested by the Egyptian government. Another, much smaller congregation, Karaite Jewish Congregation Oraḥ Ṣaddiqim, exists in Albany, NY, but they have yet to find a permanent dedicated facility and, in the mean time, continue to use a room in the home of their Ḥakham, Avraham Ben-Raḥamiël Qanaï, as their temporary synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/Building_Fund_News.shtml |title=Synagogue Building Fund |publisher=Orahsaddiqim.org |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2007, some members of the first graduating class of Karaite Jewish University were converted, representing the first new officially authorized members into Karaite Judaism in 542 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/33163/edition_id/614/format/html/displaystory.html |title=A conversion for the ages &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jewishsf.com |date=2007-08-02 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a ceremony in its Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors joined the Jewish people by taking the same oath that Ruth took. The group's course of study lasted over one year. This conversion comes 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103393.html Karaites hold first conversion in 500 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011151023/http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103393.html |date=2008-10-11 }}. 2 August 2007, JTA Breaking News.&lt;/ref&gt;
On 17 February 2009, the second graduating class of converts took the oath. This included 11 adults and 8 minors.

There are about 80 Karaites living in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], where the only [[Karaite Synagogue (Istanbul)|Karaite synagogue]] in Turkey, the ''Kahal haKadosh Bene Mikra'', is still functional (on Shabbat and holy days) in the Hasköy neighborhood in the European part of the city.

In Poland, Karaites are a recognized minority, represented by the Association of Polish Karaites ({{lang-pl|Związek Karaimów Polskich}}) and the Karaite Religious Association in the Polish Republic ({{lang-pl|Karaimski Związek Religijny w Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej}}). Karaites live primarily in and around [[Warsaw]], [[Wrocław]] and [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]], they are linguistically assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mswia.gov.pl/portal.php?serwis=pl&amp;dzial=61&amp;id=37#karaimi|title=Charakterystyka mniejszości narodowych i etnicznych w Polsce|publisher=Ministerstwo Spraw Wewnętrznych (Polish Interior Ministry)|language=Polish|accessdate=7 April 2012|location=Warsaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225161545/http://www2.mswia.gov.pl/portal.php?serwis=pl&amp;dzial=61&amp;id=37#karaimi|archivedate=25 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Religious Council of Karaite Jews unanimously reelected their chief rabbi, Rabbi Moshe Piroz, for another four-year term. Piroz has been serving as chief rabbi since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lidman|first1=Melanie|title=Karaite Jews unanimously re-elect chief rabbi|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/karaite-jews-unanimously-re-elect-chief-rabbi/|accessdate=19 May 2016|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Karaism in Rabbinic Jewish opinion==
Rabbinic Judaism's scholars, such as Maimonides, write that people who deny the divine authority of the [[Oral Torah]] are to be considered among the heretics. However, at the same time, Maimonides holds (''Hilkhot Mamrim'' 3:3) that most of the Karaites and others who claim to deny the "oral teachings" are not to be held accountable for their errors in the law because they are led into error by their parents and are similar to a [[tinok shenishba]] (a captive baby), or to one who was forced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], Mishneh Torah, Judges, Laws of Rebels, 3:3&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinic scholars have traditionally held that, because the Karaites do not observe the rabbinic law on divorce, there is a strong presumption that they are [[mamzer]]im (adulterine bastards), so that marriage with them is forbidden even if they return to Rabbinic Judaism. Some recent Ashkenazi Ḥaredi scholars{{who|date=December 2014}} have held that Karaites should be regarded as [[Gentile]]s in all respects, though this is not universally accepted. They hasten to add that this opinion is not intended to insult the Karaites, but only to give individual Karaites the option of integrating into mainstream Judaism by way of [[conversion to Judaism|conversion]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In contrast, in 1971, [[Ovadia Yosef]], who was then the [[List of Sephardi chief rabbis of the Land of Israel|Chief Rabbi of the Sefaradim]] and ‘Edot HaMizraḥ of Israel, proclaimed that Karaites are Jews "LeKhol Davar" (literally, for all purposes) and that it is permissible for Rabbinic Jews to marry with them.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In response to the position taken by the Karaites in regards to the authority of the [[Talmud]], [[Orthodox Judaism]] counters first that the majority of the Oral Law codified in the Mishnah and Talmud are the legal rulings of the last [[Sanhedrin]], a body of 71 elders that made up the highest court of jurisprudence in ancient Israel, and that not all of the Oral Law are literally "Laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai". The decisions made by this High Court must be upheld, per se the Law of Moses ([[Deuteronomy]] 17), this gives their legal rulings divine authority. Karaites reject the authority of this Sanhedrin that developed during the second Temple period partly because it was an admixture of different people and not just priests and levites as mandated by the Torah. The Sanhedrin also took legal authority away from the descendants of [[Zadok]] who served as priests in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. This is essentially the same view held by the [[Sadducees]] and [[Boethusians]] during the second Temple period. Secondly Rabbinic Judaism points to the innumerable examples of biblical commandments that are either too ambiguous or documented in such a concise fashion that proper adherence could not be enforced on a national scale without the further legislation provided by the Talmud. Karaites respond that the Torah itself states "this law I am commanding you is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. It is not in the heavens, to say, who shall ascend into the heavens and bring it to us, and cause us to understand it, that we do it?" indicating the Torah could easily be understood by the average Israelite. Examples cited in Rabbinic Judaism as laws requiring rabbinic explanation include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishinspiration.com/tape.php?tape_id=33 Rietti, Rabbi Jonathan. The Oral Law: The Heart of The Torah]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tefillin]]: As indicated in Deuteronomy 6:8 among other places, tefillin are to be placed on the arm and on the head between the eyes. However, there are no details provided regarding what tefillin are or how they are to be constructed. Karaites, however, argue that since other passages in the Tanakh with similar language are read metaphorically, the verses from which the Rabbis derive the law of tefillin should also be read metaphorically.
*[[Kashrut]] laws: As indicated in Exodus 23:19 among other places, a kid may not be boiled in its mother's milk. In addition to numerous other problems with understanding the ambiguous nature of this law, there are no vowelization characters in the Torah; they are provided by the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] tradition. This is particularly relevant to this commandment, as the Hebrew word for ''milk'' is identical to the word for ''fat'' when vowels are absent. Without the oral tradition, it is not known whether the violation is in mixing meat with milk or with fat. Karaites maintain the vowels of the text have been preserved by the Masorites who themselves were Karaites.
*[[Shabbat]] laws: With the severity of Sabbath violation, namely the death penalty, one would assume that direction would be provided as to how exactly such a serious and core commandment should be upheld. However, there is little to no information as to what can and cannot be performed on the Sabbath. Karaites, nonetheless, do keep the Shabbat according to their own traditions and interpretations, as described in the section above.
*[[Mezuzah]]: Deuteronomy 6:9 is sometimes interpreted to mean that a mezuzah needs to be placed on the doorposts of a house. However, there are no details regarding where on the doorpost, if it is all doorposts or just one, what words go in it, how the words should be written or how the mezuzah should be constructed. As with the passage from which the rabbis derive the tradition of teffilin Karaites state this passage is also intended to be understood metaphorically and not literally.

Orthodox Judaism also notes that the Torah was never meant to be observed as a personal covenant between the individual Jew and God, but a national covenant wherein the Torah functions as the constitution of Israel as a whole. Orthodox Jews{{who|date=December 2014}} point out that the Torah could never be enforced as a national law, as it was during the time of Joshua, King David, and Ezra, if every individual Jew had their own opinion on how to observe its commandments. In order for the Torah to properly govern the Jewish people, and for its laws be legally enforced with the punishments and penalties prescribed in the Torah, those laws must be legislated and clearly defined by a ruling Sanhedrin. Karaites{{who|date=December 2014}} counter that the enforcement of the Torah on a national scale can only be legislated by the descendants of [[Zadok]] in the Temple in Jerusalem as per the Torah (Deuteronomy 17) and prophets (Ezekiel 44) not by a collection of opinions by various rabbis.

For Karaites, in sum, the rabbinic interpretations above, as codified in oral law, are only one form of interpretation. They are not divinely ordained, and they are neither binding halakhah nor practical religious law.

===Rabbinical classification of a Jew===
A person whose mother was a Karaite Jew is regarded as halakhically Jewish by the Orthodox Rabbinate. By contrast, somebody who is patrilineally Jewish (one whose father is Jewish) is regarded as a Jew by the ''Mo′eṣet HaḤakhamim'' (the Karaite Council of Sages) on the condition that they were raised Jewish during childhood. Although it is widely accepted that Karaite Jews are halakhically Jewish (apparently with the exception of those who join the Jewish people through the Karaite movement), there is still a question as to whether or not marriage between the Karaite and Rabbinite communities is permitted. Two Sephardi chief rabbis, Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron&lt;ref&gt;Tehumin 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; and Ovadia Yosef&lt;ref&gt;Yabia Omer EH 8:12&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged such marriages, hoping it would help Karaites to assimilate into mainstream Judaism. Maimonides decreed that Jews raised in a Karaite household are considered to be ''Tinoq she'Nishba'', like babies taken captive by non-Jews; they cannot be punished for their supposedly wayward behavior, because it is the result of their parents' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Hilkhot Mamrim 3:2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 2010s, there has been a resurgence in the questioning of the Jewish identity of Karaites by Israel's chief rabbinate. According to the rabbinate's spokesman,{{who|date=July 2014}} "Israel is a Jewish state and Jews have superior rights. But the Karaites are not Jewish."&lt;ref name = EconomistWhoIsAJew&gt;{{cite web|title=Who’s a Jew?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21578098-old-religious-argument-once-again-rears-its-angry-head-whos-jew|website=The Economist|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to protestations from R' Moshe Firrouz, head of the Karaites' Council of Sages, that "the rabbinate is denying us our religious freedom."&lt;ref name = EconomistWhoIsAJew/&gt;

'''Lokstenes dievturu svētnīca''' (Lokstene shrine) is a [[Dievturi]] religious building in [[Pļaviņas Municipality]], [[Latvia]]. It is used by the organization Latvijas Dievturu sadraudze for devotional ceremonies and annual celebrations.

== Details ==
The building is located on a small island in the [[Daugava]] river, behind the Liepkalni bakery and café in Liepsalas, close to the town [[Pļaviņas]].&lt;ref name="diezina"&gt;Sandra Dieziņa. 17 January 2017. [http://www.la.lv/maize-ar-dveseli/ “Liepsalās” atklās dievturu svētnīcu]. ''[[Latvijas Avīze]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the nearby Lokstene castle mound.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;[http://www.la.lv/uz-salas-daugava-atklata-dievturu-svetnica/ Uz salas Daugavā uzceļ dievturu svētnīcu]. 11 May 2017. ''[[Latvijas Avīze]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire complex includes a sanctuary building, a ferry, an assembly and flag square, a monument to the ancestors, and a gate of the sun.&lt;ref name="la" /&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Klintaines pagasts, Latvia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The sanctuary under construction on 6 March 2016]]
The project was financed by Dagnis Čākurs, owner of the Liepkalni bakery chain. Čākurs explained that as he had grown older, he had become more interested in questions about the soul and mortality. As the Latvian people had supported his business over the years, he wanted to give something in return, and hoped to do so with a house for the national gods and Latvian folk culture.&lt;ref&gt;Antra Lāce. 8 May 2015. [http://www.eliesma.lv/dagnis-cakurs-pienacis-laiks-dot-citiem Dagnis Čākurs: pienācis laiks dot citiem]. ''eLiesma''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design was developed by [[Dievturība|Latvijas Dievturu sadraudze]] (LDS) under the leadership of [[Valdis Celms]]. The architect was Ainārs Markvarts. The [[interior design]] was done by Andrejs Broks and Egons Garklāvs. The sculptor was Jānis Karlovs.&lt;ref name="skaties"&gt;[https://skaties.lv/zinas/latvija/sabiedriba/uz-salas-daugava-atklata-dievturu-svetnica/ Uz salas Daugavā atklāta dievturu svētnīca]. 11 May 2017. ''Skaties''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity ==
The island is owned by Čākurs and is leased by the LDS.&lt;ref name="jaunagaita"&gt;Anita Liepiņa. [http://jaunagaita.net/jg290/JG290_Liepina.htm Latvijas Dievturu Sadraudzes (LDS) vieta Latvijā]. ''Jaunā Gaita'' no. 290. Autumn 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; LDS began to use the building in the autumn of 2016, before the entire complex was finished.&lt;ref name="diezina" /&gt; The official opening took place on 6 May 2017.&lt;ref name="skaties" /&gt;

The building regularly hosts devotional ceremonies and celebrations, such as family celebrations, celebrations of moral and spiritual values, and celebration of the Latvian national day.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Pumpure. 9 May 2017. [http://www.staburags.lv/novadu-zinas/atklaj-lokstenes-svetnicu-147583 Atklāj Lokstenes svētnīcu]. ''[[Staburags (newspaper)|Staburags]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anita Liepiņa of the literary magazine ''Jaunā Gaita'' argued in 2017 that the building should receive state support just like churches receive support for maintenance.&lt;ref name="jaunagaita" /&gt;

'''Mastana Balochistani''' (honorifically known as '''Shehanshah Shah Mastana Balochistani Ji Maharaj''', 15 November 1891 – 18 April 1960) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] saint and the founder of the socio-spiritual organization [[Dera Sacha Sauda]] (DSS) on 29 April 1948 in [[Sirsa, Haryana|Sirsa]] (modern [[Haryana]]). He was originally from [[Balochistan]], and later moved to [[Sirsa, Haryana|Sirsa]].&lt;ref name="Mastana Ji Maharaj&amp;nbsp;— DSS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derasachasauda.org/shah-mastana-ji-maharaj/|title=Shah Mastana Ji Maharaj&amp;nbsp;— DSS|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Balochistani was born as  Khemamal, son of  Pillamal and Tulsa Bai, in 1891 in Kalat district in [[Balochistan]], [[British India]]. Later [[Baba Sawan Singh]] honoured him with the name of Shah 'Mastana Balochistani' Ji.  [[Baba Sawan Singh]] further declared him "Mastanon ka Mastana, Shahon Ka Shah ". At the age of 14 years, Balochistani left home in search of a perfect spiritual Guru (teacher). At last, after searching for nine years, he reached Beas in the state of Punjab in India, where he met [[Baba Sawan Singh]] (the second Satguru of Satsang Beas where he attended his Satsang (spiritual congregation) and learned the method of meditation from him. [[Baba Sawan Singh]] entrusted Balochistani with the task of conducting spiritual discourses  and teaching meditation to the people in the provinces of Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab.&lt;ref name="Mastana Ji Maharaj&amp;nbsp;— DSS"/&gt;

Later [[Baba Sawan Singh]] assigned Balochistani duty in the vicinity of Bagarh a (region of northern Rajasthan and western Haryana). Balochistani established [[Dera Sacha Sauda]] and raised public awareness of Naam-Shabd. He laid the foundation of Dera Sacha Sauda in 1948 in Sirsa. He laid the principle of earning through hard work and absolutely prohibited acceptance of donations or charity of any kind.&lt;ref name="Mastana Ji Maharaj&amp;nbsp;— DSS"/&gt;

Upon his death, [[Shah Satnam Singh]] became spiritual leader of DSS at age 41, serving from 1960 to 1990, followed by [[Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh]] starting 1990.

==Teachings==

Balochistani taught the method of meditation (Naam Shabad) to thousands of people over a period of twelve years (1948-1960). During this period, people from various parts of the country started coming to [[Dera Sacha Sauda]] and became his followers. He built 25 ashrams in [[Haryana]], [[Punjab]] and [[Rajasthan]]. Facilities of drinking water and langar (free community meals) were provided in these ashrams. He taught the practical method of meditation to thousands of people in simple language.&lt;ref name="Mastana Ji Maharaj&amp;nbsp;— DSS"/&gt;

[[File:Kamogawa_ceremony_02.jpg|thumb|Miko perform Shinto ceremony near the [[Kamo River]]]]

In [[Shinto]], a '''''miko''''' ([[wiktionary:巫女|巫女]]) is a shrine ([[Shinto shrine|jinja]]) maiden&lt;ref name="Groemer, 28"&gt;Groemer, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aston, 101&lt;/ref&gt; or a supplementary [[priest]]ess.&lt;ref&gt;North-China herald, 571&lt;/ref&gt; Miko were once likely seen as a [[Shamanism|shaman]]&lt;ref name="Picken, 140"&gt;Picken, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; but are understood in modern Japanese culture to be an institutionalized&lt;ref&gt;Groemer, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; role in daily shrine life, trained to perform tasks, ranging from [[sacred]] cleansing&lt;ref name="Picken, 140"/&gt; to performing the sacred [[Kagura]] dance.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical description==
[[File:JP-tokio-meiji-mikos.jpg|thumb|The miko's attire consists of a white haori and a red hakama. The hair is tied in a ponytail with a white and red hair ribbon.]]

The traditional attire of a ''miko'' would be a pair of red [[hakama]] (long, divided trousers) or a long, red, slightly pleated skirt tied with a bow, a white [[haori]] ([[kimono]] jacket), and some white or red hair ribbons. In Shintoism, the color white symbolizes purity.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Traditional Miko tools include [[azusayumi]] (梓弓 or “catalpa bow”)&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 76&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tamagushi]] (玉串 or “offertory sakaki-tree branches”)&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[gehōbako]] (外法箱 or the “supernatural box that contains dolls, animal and human skulls ... [and] Shinto prayer beads”).&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The miko also use bells, drums, candles, and bowls of rice in ceremonies.

==Definition==
The Japanese words ''miko'' and ''[[fujo]]'' ("female shaman" and "shrine maiden" respectively&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"&gt;Kokugo Dai Jiten Dictionary, Revised edition, Shogakukan, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;) are usually written 巫女&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt; as a compound of the kanji [[wikt:巫#Japanese|巫]] ("shaman"), and [[wikt:女#Japanese|女]] ("woman").&lt;ref name=Shogakukan/&gt; ''Miko'' was archaically written [[wikt:神子|神子]] (literally "kami" or "god" + "child")&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt; and [[wikt:巫子#Japanese|巫子]] ("shaman child").&lt;ref name=Shogakukan/&gt;

''Miko'' once performed spirit possession and ''takusen'' as vocational functions in their service to shrines. As time passed, they left the shrines and began working independently in secular society. Miko at shrines today do no more than sit at reception counters and perform [[kagura]] dance. In addition to a medium or a miko (or a [[Shaman|Geki]], which is a male shaman), the site of a ''takusen'' may occasionally also be attended by a [[sayaniwa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1315 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510061632/http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1315 |archivedate=2015-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who interprets the words of the possessed person to make them comprehensible to other people present.

Miko are known by many names; Fairchild lists 26 terms for "shrine-attached Miko"&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 119&lt;/ref&gt; and 43 for "non-shrine-attached Miko".&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Other names are ''[[ichiko]]'' ([[wikt:巫子#Japanese|巫子]], "shaman child", or [[wikt:市子#Japanese|市子]], "market/town child", both likely instances of [[ateji]]) meaning "female medium; fortuneteller",&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt; and ''[[reibai]]'' ([[wikt:霊媒#Japanese|霊媒]]) meaning "spirit go-between, medium").&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt;

In English, the word is often translated as "[[shrine]] [[maiden]]", though freer renderings often simply use the phrase "[[female]] [[shaman]]" ([[shamanka]]{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}) or, as [[Lafcadio Hearn]] translated it, "Divineress".&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} prefer the transliteration, contrasting the Japanese [[Mikoism]]{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} with other Asian terms for female shamans.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} As Fairchild explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Women played an important role in a region stretching from Manchuria, China, Korea and Japan to the Ryukyu Islands. In Japan these women were priests, soothsayers, magicians, prophets and shamans in the folk religion, and they were the chief performers in organized Shintoism. These women were called Miko, and the author calls the complex "Mikoism" for lack of a suitable English word.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mikoism==
===History===
Miko traditions date back to the prehistoric [[Jōmon period]]&lt;ref name="Groemer, 28"/&gt; of Japan, when female shamans{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} who would go into “trances and convey the words of the gods”{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} (the [[kami]]), an act comparable with "the pythia or sibyl in Ancient Greece."&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest record of anything resembling the term "miko", is of the Chinese reference to [[Himiko]], Japan's earliest substantiated historical reference (not legendary), however it is completely unknown whether Himiko was a miko, or even if miko existed in those days.

The early Miko was an important social figure{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} who was "associated with the ruling class".{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} "In addition to her ritual performances of ecstatic trance", writes Kuly, "[the Miko] performed a variety of religious and political functions".&lt;ref name="Kuly, 199"&gt;Kuly, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; One traditional school of Miko, Kuly adds, "claimed to descend from the [[ Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto |Goddess Uzume]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kuly, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Nara period]] (710–794) and [[Heian period]] (794–1185), government officials tried to control Miko practices.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} As Fairchild notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 780 A.D. and in 807 A.D. official bulls against the practice of ecstasy outside of the authority of the shrines were published. These bulls were not only aimed at ecstasy, but were aimed at magicians, priests, sorcerers, etc. It was an attempt to gain complete control, while at the same time it aimed at eradicating abuses which were occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the feudal [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) when Japan was controlled by warring ''[[shōgun]]'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Miko was forced into a state of mendicancy as the shrines and temples that provided her with a livelihood fell into bankruptcy. Disassociated from a religious context, her performance moved further away from a religious milieu and more toward one of a non-ecclesiastical nature. The travelling Miko, known as the aruki Miko, became associated with prostitution.&lt;ref name="Kuly, 199"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During in the [[Edo]] period (1603–1868), writes Groemer, "the organizational structures and arts practiced by female shamans in eastern Japan underwent significant transformations".&lt;ref&gt;Groemer, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Though in the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] period (1868–1912), many shamanistic practices were outlawed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After 1867 the Meiji government's desire to create a form of state Shinto headed by the emperor&amp;mdash;the shaman-in-chief of the nation&amp;mdash;meant that Shinto needed to be segregated from both Buddhism and folk-religious beliefs. As a result, official discourse increasingly repeated negative views of Miko and their institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Groemer, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was an edict called ''Miko Kindanrei'' (巫女禁断令) enforced by security forces loyal to Imperial forces, forbidding all spiritual practices by miko, issued in 1873, by the Religious Affairs Department (教部).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.hatena.ne.jp/mayumi_charron/touch/searchdiary?word=*%255B%25BF%25C0%25C6%25BB+%25D6%25E0%25BD%25F7%255D|title=『*%5B%BF%C0%C6%BB %D6%E0%BD%F7%5D』の検索結果 - 耀姫の日記|author=|date=|website=d.hatena.ne.jp|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424204924/http://d.hatena.ne.jp/mayumi_charron/touch/searchdiary?word=*%255B%25BF%25C0%25C6%25BB+%25D6%25E0%25BD%25F7%255D|archivedate=24 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shinto [[kagura]] dance ceremony, which originated with "ritual dancing to convey divine oracles",{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} has been transformed in the 20th century into a popular ceremonial dance called [[Miko-mai]] (巫女舞){{citation needed|date=December 2011}} or [[Miko-kagura]] (巫女神楽).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Traditional training===
[[File:Tokyo, Meiji-jingu (6215281946).jpg|thumb|Miko in [[Meiji Shrine]], Tokyo]]

The position of a shaman passed from generation to generation, but sometimes someone not directly descended from a shaman went voluntary into training or was appointed by the village chieftains. To achieve this, such a person had to have some potential. Several characteristics could be seen as a sign a person was called towards shamanism: neurosis, hallucinations, unusual behavior and hysteria. These conditions are still referred to as ''‘shamanistic sicknesses’''.

To become a shaman, the girl (still at a young age, mostly after the start of the menstruation cycle) had to undergo very intensive training specific to the ''kuchiyose miko''.&lt;ref&gt;Ichirō Hōri: ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies''{{issue needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An acknowledged elder shaman, who could be a family member (like an aunt) of a member of the tribe, would teach the girl in training the techniques required to be in control of her trance state. This would be done by rituals including washings with cold water, regular purifying, abstinence and the observation of the common taboos like death, illness and blood. She would also study how to communicate with ''kami'' and spirits of the deceased, as a medium, by being possessed by those spirits. This was achieved by chanting and dancing, thus therefore the girl was taught melodies and intonations that were used in songs, prayers and magical formulas, supported by drum and rattlers. 

Other attributes used for rituals were mirrors (to attract the kami) and swords ([[katana]]). She also needed the knowledge of the several names of the kami that were important for her village, as well as their function. Finally she learned a secret language, only known by insiders (other shamans of the tribe) and so discovered the secrets of fortune-telling and magical formulas.
After the training, which could take three to seven years, the girl would get her initiation rite to become a real shaman. This mystic ceremony was witnessed by her mentor, other elders and fellow shamans. The girl wore a white shroud as a symbol for the end of her previous life. The elders began chanting and after a while the girl started to shiver. Next, her mentor would ask the girl which ''kami'' had possessed her and therefore she would serve. As soon as she answered, the mentor would throw a rice cake into her face, causing the girl to faint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hori|first1=Ichiro|title=Folk religion in Japan : continuity and change|date=1968|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226353346|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elders would bring the girl to a warm bed and keep her warm until she woke up. When the whole ordeal was over and the girl had woken up, she was permitted to wear a beautifully coloured wedding dress and perform the corresponding tradition of the wedding toast.

The resemblance of a wedding ceremony as the initiation rite suggests that the trainee, still a virgin, had become the bride of the kami she served (this is called a ''Tamayori Hime'' 玉依姫). During her trance, said kami had requested the girl to his shrine. In some areas of Japan she had to bring a pot filled with rice (''meshibitsu'') and a pan. An old, since long forsaken, practice was the sexual intercourse with a shintô priest who would represent the kami. As a result of this intercourse, the shaman would have the ''kami’s'' baby (''mikogami'' 御子神 ). 

In some cases the girls or women were visited at night by a travelling spirit (''marebito'' 稀人). After this visit the woman made her new position of being possessed by a ''kami'' known to the rest of her village by placing a white, feathered arrow on the roof of her house.

==Contemporary miko==
[[File:Miko at the Ikuta Shrine.jpg|thumb|Miko at the [[Ikuta Shrine]]]]

Modern miko are often seen at Shinto shrines, where they assist with shrine functions, perform ceremonial dances, offer ''[[omikuji]]'' fortune telling, sell souvenirs, and assist a [[Kannushi]] in Shinto rites. Kuly describes the contemporary miko: "A far distant relative of her premodern shamanic sister, she is most probably a university student collecting a modest wage in this part-time position."&lt;ref&gt;Kuly, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnologist [[Kunio Yanagita]] (1875–1962), who first studied Japanese female shamans, differentiated them into ''jinja miko'' (神社巫女 or "shrine shamans") who dance with bells and participate in ''yudate'' (湯立て or "boiling water") rituals, ''kuchiyose miko'' (口寄せ巫女 or "spirit medium shamans") who speak on behalf of the deceased, and ''kami uba'' (神姥 or "god women") who engage in cult worship and invocations (for instance, the [[Tenrikyo]] founder [[Nakayama Miki]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kawamura, 258-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have further categorized contemporary miko in terms of their diverse traditions and practices. Such categorizations include blind ''itako'' (concentrated in north and east Japan), mostly blind ''okamin'' (north and east Japan), blind ''waka'' or ''owaka'' (northeastern Japan), ''moriko'' (north and east of Tokyo), ''nono'' (central Japan), blind ''zatokaka'' (northwest Japan), ''sasa hataki'' who tap ''[[Sasa (plant)|sasa]]'' ("bamboo grass") on their faces (northeast of Tokyo), plus family and village organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 62–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have divided miko or fujo by [[blindness]] between blind ''ogamiya'' (尾上屋 or "invocation specialist") or ''ogamisama'' who perform ''kuchiyose'' and spirit mediumship and sighted miko' or ''kamisama'' who perform divination and invocations.&lt;ref&gt;Kawamura, 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eclectic [[Shugendō]] religion, male priests who practiced ecstasy often married miko.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild 1962:55.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars identify shamanic miko characteristics in [[Japanese new religions|Shinshūkyō]] ("New Religions") such as [[Sukyo Mahikari]], [[Ōmoto]], and [[Shinmeiaishinkai]].&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardacre.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuly, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Missionaries of Charity attack in Aden''' was a [[mass murder]] crime committed by unknown gunmen inside a home for older people in [[Aden]], [[Yemen]] on 4 March 2016.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/world/middleeast/gunmen-kill-14-at-nursing-home-in-yemen-started-by-mother-teresa.html|title=Gunmen Kill 16 at Nursing Home in Yemen Started by Mother Teresa|date=5 March 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Christianity in Yemen}}
Christian presence in [[Yemen]] goes back to the fourth century AD to hold a number of [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarites]] believers due to the efforts of [[Theophilos the Indian]]. Currently, there are no official statistics on their numbers, but estimated at between 3,000 and 25,000 people,&lt;ref name="us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2008/108496.htm|title=Yemen|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of them are refugees or temporary residents.

[[Freedom of worship]], conversion from Islam and establishing facilities dedicated for worship are not recognized in the Constitution or as laws or legal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/193127.pdf|format=PDF|title=Yemen : Executive summary|website=State.gov|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Wahhabism|Wahabbi]] activities linked to [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|Al-Islah]] were being facilitated, financed and encouraged from multiple fronts including the Ministry of Endowments and Guidance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shelagh Weir|title=A Tribal Order: Politics and Law in the Mountains of Yemen|date=2009|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292773974|quote=''These activities were encouraged and financed, as elsewhere in Yemen, by the then Wahhabi-controlled Ministry of Religious Guidance (irsha ̄d), by Saudi and Yemeni business figures and by the Yemeni Reform Grouping islah''|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; which says that its tasks "to contribute to the development of Islamic awareness and circulation of the publication Education and Islamic morals and consolidation in the life of public and private citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yemen-nic.info/ministations/section.php?SECTION_ID=452|title=وزارة الأوقاف والإرشاد|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Missionaries of Charity, founded by [[Mother Teresa]], have worked in Aden since 1992, and the order has three other centers in [[Sana'a]], [[Taiz]] and [[Al Hudaydah|Hodeidah]]. Three Catholic nuns were killed in Hodeidah in 1998, two from India and the third from the Philippines, at the hands of a member of Al-Islah Abdullah al-Nashiri, arguing that they were calling for conversion to [[Christianity]]. In 2002, three Americans were killed in Baptists Hospital at the hands of another Al-Islah member named Abed Abdul Razak Kamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205561/too-deep-evan-kohlmann|title=National Review Online|author=Evan Kohlmann|date=17 January 2003|work=National Review Online|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors say that the hospital was "a political football" often raised by Islamists (Al-Islah), who talked about it in mosques and hospital workers describing Hospital workers as "spies". But they emphasized that these opinions are a minority among Yemenis.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/16/world/threats-and-responses-victims-nine-bullets-that-ended-baptists-work-in-yemen.html|title=Nine Bullets That Ended Baptists' Work in Yemen|date=16 January 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, a Catholic church in Aden was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gunmen-kill-16-at-retirement-home-in-aden-1457094756|title=Gunmen Kill 16 at Yemeni Home for the Elderly|author=Saleh al-Batati in Yemen and Asa Fitch in Dubai|date=6 March 2016|work=WSJ|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the escalation of the Yemeni crisis in March 2015, six priests from [[John Bosco]] remained, and twenty workers of charitable missions in the country, described by [[Pope Francis]] by the courage to fortitude amid war and conflict. He called the [[Apostolic Vicar]] of Southern Arabia to pray for all the oppressed and tortured, expelled from their homes, and killed unjustly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/catholics-yemen|title=Catholics in Yemen|work=America Magazine|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Missionaries of Charity were not actively engaged in [[Evangelism|evangelization]] according to the testimonies of beneficiaries of its services.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2002/12/30/three-american-missionaries-killed-in-yemen-hospital.html|title=Three American Missionaries Killed in Yemen Hospital|work=Fox News|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
The attack on the house took place at 12:00pm local time, when two armed men had persuaded the guards to let them through the main gate having claimed they were going to visit their elderly mother. Once they entered, they began to shoot randomly, according to Indian officials at the Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/4-indian-nurses-among-16-dead-in-yemen-gun-attack-govt-verifying-reports|title=Indian nun among 16 killed by gunmen in Yemen; victims handcuffed, shot in the head|date=5 March 2016|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the building, nuns were preparing breakfast. Four of the five nuns sensed danger and tried to hide in a convent, where they were shot dead in an open area. All the rooms were stormed and the meeting tent was destroyed, as were statues and crucifixes in the small church. In one picture, two nuns are shown lying on the ground in a dirt yard, after having been shot [[Capital punishment|execution-style]].

Sunita Kumar, a spokesman for the charity's mission, described the killers as "demented", adding "there is no other explanation as to why armed people would enter the premises of the home and shoot down innocent, harmless nurses who had dedicated their lives to serving others."&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt; Bishop Michael Lewis of the Anglican Church said the compound contained seventy or eighty elderly people, many destitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/03/prayers-offered-after-killing-of-nuns-in-yemen.aspx|title=Prayers offered after killing of nuns in Yemen|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Parolin]] commented that [[Pope Francis]] prayed that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart and inspire all parties to lay down their arms and take up the path of dialogue.&lt;ref name="qaeda"/&gt;

[[File:Orobas.png|thumb|An early woodcut image of '''Orobas''' (Image accompanying the entry "Orobas" in: [[Collin de Plancy]] (1863) ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'', p. 510)]] 
In [[demonology]], '''Orobas''' is a powerful Great Prince of [[Hell]], having twenty [[wikt:Legion|legions]] of [[demon]]s under his control.

He supposedly gives true answers of things past, present and to come, divinity, and the creation of the world; he also confers dignities and prelacies, and the favour of friends and foes. Orobas is faithful to the [[Evocation|conjurer]], does not permit that any [[spirit]] tempts him, and never deceives anyone.

He is depicted as a horse that changes into a man under the conjurer's request.

The name could come from the [[Latin]] 'orobias', a type of [[incense]].

==In popular culture==
Orobas is [[Monster in My Pocket]] #78; there, he is described as an "oracle" rather than a demon.

Orobas is the name of a Dragon Knight in the [[video game]] ''[[Divinity 2: Ego Draconis]]''. He was the ruler of a very successful area named ''The Orobas Fjords'', and was viewed as a god by some.

Orobas is referenced in the DVD extras of the horror film [[Lovely Molly]] as the likely agent of the film's main character's demonic possession.

Orobas appears in the [[Megami Tensei]] video game series, as a demon that can be summoned by the player.

Orobas is an optional fight in [[Shadow Hearts: Covenant]].  He is fought at the end of the Neam Ruins side area and Anastasia can learn her final spell "Euthanasia" by snapping his photo.  In this game, Orobas appears as a regal looking man with the lower body of a gigantic flying insect.

This demon appears as a recruitable monster in [[Dragon Quest V]], being a recolor of [[Gamigin]] and [[Samigina]]

The Orobas Vectura is a large spaceship in the video game [[Destiny 2]]. Continuing with the theme of Cabal ships being named after a Demon and a word for Voyage. Ex; Dantalion Exodus from Destiny 1

'''Polytheistic reconstructionism''' (or simply '''Reconstructionism''') is an approach to [[paganism]] first emerging in the late 1960s to early 1970s, which gathered momentum starting in the 1990s. Reconstructionism attempts to re-establish  historical [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions in the modern world, in contrast with [[neopagan]] [[Syncretism|syncretic]] movements like [[Wicca]], and "channeled" movements like [[Germanic mysticism]] or [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].

While the emphasis on historical accuracy may imply [[historical reenactment]], the desire  for continuity in ritual traditions ([[orthopraxy]]) is a common characteristic of religion in general, as seen in Anglican [[ritualism]], or in much [[Christian liturgy]].&lt;ref name="ecauldron.net"&gt;http://www.ecauldron.net/dc-faq.php#4&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[D. H. Lawrence]] put a sketch of a fictional program into the mouth of a character in  ''[[The Plumed Serpent]]'' (published in 1926):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So if I want Mexicans to learn the name of [[Quetzalcoatl]], it is because I want them to speak with the tongues of their own blood. I wish the [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] world would once more think in terms of [[Thor]] and [[Wotan]], and the tree [[Igdrasil]]. And I wish the [[Druidic]] world would see, honestly, that in the [[mistletoe]] is their mystery, and that they themselves are the [[Tuatha De Danaan]], alive, but submerged. And a new [[Hermes]] should come back to the [[Mediterranean]], and a new [[Astarte| Ashtaroth]] to Tunis; and [[Mithras]] again to Persia, and [[Brahma]] unbroken to India, and the oldest of dragons to China.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "Reconstructionist Paganism" was likely coined by [[Isaac Bonewits]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="brp"&gt;{{cite book | first =Isaac | last =Bonewits | authorlink = Isaac Bonewits| coauthors = | year =2006 | month = | title =Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition =  | publisher =[[Kensington/Citadel]] | location =New York| isbn =0-8065-2710-2 | url =| page =131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonewits has said that he is not sure whether he "got this use of the term from one or more of the other culturally focused Neopagan movements of the time, or if [he] just applied it in a novel fashion."&lt;ref name="brp"/&gt; [[Margot Adler]] later used the term "Pagan Reconstructionists" in the 1979 edition of ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon]]'' to refer to those who endeavour through scholarly research and use of folklore, to revive or "reconstruct" a historically accurate, pre-Christian spiritual practice. This emphasis on reconstruction contrasts with the more fanciful and eclectic approaches to paganism, as seen for example in [[Wicca]].&lt;ref name="Adler1"&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''[[Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]''. Boston, Beacon Press {{ISBN|0-8070-3237-9}}. Chapter 9: Religions from the Past—The Pagan Reconstructionists.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstructionism and Neopaganism==
{{See also|Neopaganism|List of Modern pagan movements}}

Linzie (2004) enumerates the difference between modern reconstructionist polytheism, (such as modern [[Hellenismos]]), and "classical" paganism as found in eighteenth to mid-twentieth century movements, (including [[Germanic mysticism]], early [[Neodruidism]] and [[Wicca]]).  Aspects of the former, not found in the latter, are as follows:

# There is no attempt to recreate a combined pan-European Paganism.
# Researchers attempt to stay within research guidelines developed over the course of the past century for handling documentation generated in the time periods that they are studying.
# A multi-disciplinary approach is utilized capitalizing on results from various fields as historical literary research, anthropology, religious history, political history, archaeology, forensic anthropology, historical sociology, etc. with an overt attempt to avoid pseudo-sciences.
# There are serious attempts to recreate culture, politics, science and art of the period in order to better understand the environment within which the religious beliefs were practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Linzie (2004), 5f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the terms "[[Paganism|Pagan]]" and "Neopagan" to apply to polytheistic reconstructionists is controversial.&lt;ref name="ecauldron.net"/&gt;  Some reconstructionist, ethnic and indigenous religious groups take great issue with being referred to as "Pagan" or "Neopagan," viewing "Pagan" as a pejorative term used in the past by institutions attempting to destroy their cultures and religions.&lt;ref name="sceh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&amp;f=faq#24|title=Pagans|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes|author=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, reconstructionists may choose to reject the terms "Pagan" and "Neopagan" in order to distance themselves from aspects of popular Neopaganism, such as eclecticism, cultural appropriation, the practice of magic, and a tendency to conduct rituals within a Wiccan-derived format, that they find irrelevant or even inimical to their religious practice.&lt;ref name="heath"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wyrdwords.vispa.com/heathenry/callusheathen.html|title=Call us Heathens!|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Journal of the  Pagan Federation|year=1997|author=Arlea Anschütz, Stormerne Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among those reconstructionist groups who see themselves as part of the broader, Pagan or Neopagan spectrum, or who simply see some members of the Pagan community as allies, there is still a refusal to accept or identify with what they see as the more problematic aspects of that community, such as the above-noted eclecticism, [[cultural appropriation]] or Wiccan-inspired ritual structures. Many Polytheistic Reconstructionists see Reconstructionism as the older current in the Pagan community, and are unwilling to give up this part of their history simply because eclectic movements are currently more fashionable.&lt;ref name="sceh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Adler | first = Margot | title = Drawing down the Moon, page 282 | publisher = Penguin/Arkana | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-14-019536-X | page = 262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3371">The '''''protos''''' ({{lang-el|πρώτος}}, "first, premier") is a monastic office at the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[monasticism|monastic]] state of [[Mount Athos]] in [[Greece]]. 

==Authority==
The office is assumed by a [[monk]] who is elected among the members of the ''Iera Epistasia'' ("Holy Administration") which functions as the executive committee of the ''Iera Koinotita'' ("Holy Community") &amp;mdash; the  governing body of Athos composed of representatives from each of the Athonite monasteries &amp;mdash; to be the head of the Athonite monastic community. He wields certain ecclesiastical powers, takes part in [[patriarch]]al [[synod]]s, and has the right to confirm and dismiss abbots, with the approval of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], under whose jurisdiction Mount Athos functions as an autonomous monastic republic. In the past, the ''protos'' seems to have been given authority to [[ordination|ordain]] (''[[Christian laying on of hands|cheirotonia]]'') [[priest]]s, but currently ordinations on Mount Athos are performed by the [[Archbishop of Thessaloniki]].

The earliest historical documentation of the office of ''protos'' is from 908. The first ''[[typikon]]'' of Mount Athos (the book containing monastic rules and regulations), published by the [[List of Byzantine emperors|emperor]] [[John Tzimiskes]] in 972, recognised the first authority over Mount Athos which was elected by the monasteries. During the centuries that followed, the institution of the ''protos'' would at times flourish and at other times decline. 

In the beginning of the nineteenth century the ''typikon'' of 1810 was published, which assigned the ''protos'' along with four overseers and with a [[synod|holy synod]] composed of representatives from the twenty sovereign monasteries which make up the Mount Athos community. 

The seat of the ''protos'' has been in [[Karyes (Athos)|Karyes]] since 911, and the primary church for the Athonite administration is called the ''[http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HellenicMacedonia/en/C2.A.3.1.html Protaton]''.

'''Saini''' ({{Audio|saini.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a caste of [[North India]] who were traditionally landowners ([[zamindars]]) and farmers. Sainis claim to be descendants of a king, [[Shurasena]], as well as of [[Krishna]] and [[King Porus|Porus]], and to be related to the ancient Shoorsaini clan,&lt;ref name = "Shoorsaini"&gt;'' "The Sainis believe that their ancestors were Yadavas and that it was the same lineage in which Krishna was born. In the 43rd generation of the Yadavas there was a king known as Shoor or Sur, the son of King Vidaratha....It was in the name of these, father and son, that the community was known as Shoorsaini or Sursaini."'' People of India: Haryana, p 430, Kumar Suresh Singh, Madan Lal Sharma, A. K. Bhatia, Anthropological Survey of India, Published by Published on behalf of Anthropological Survey of India by Manohar Publishers, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; noted in [[Puranic]] literature. The 1901 census noted that people using the Shoorsaini name were by then found only in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Delhi]]. Sainis also claim themselves to be [[Mali Rajput]]s.&lt;ref name = "Saini Rajput"/&gt;

As both a statutory agricultural tribe and a designated [[martial race]] during the [[British Raj]] era that followed the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Sainis had been chiefly engaged in both agriculture and military service since then until recent times. However, since the independence of India, Sainis have diversified into different trades and professions other than military and agriculture. Sainis are now also seen in increasing numbers as businessmen, lawyers, professors, civil servants, engineers, doctors and research scientists, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''"The members of Saini community are employed in business and white-collar jobs and as teachers, administrators, lawyers, doctors and defence personnel."'' People of India, National Series Volume VI, India's Communities N-Z, p 3091, KS Singh, Anthropological Survey of India, Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Sainis profess in both Hinduism and Sikhism. They have a national organisation called ''Saini Rajput Mahasabha'' located in Delhi, established in 1920.&lt;ref name = "Saini Rajput Mahasabha"&gt;People of India: Haryana, p 437, Kumar Suresh Singh, Madan Lal Sharma, A.

==History==
===Mythology===

The Sainis of Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur districts claim to be the descendants of the Rajputs of the Yaduvanshi or Surasena lineage who ruled these kingdoms, who came to these areas to avoid forced conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name = "Surasena Mathura"&gt;"Surasena refers to an ancient region named after a Jadu raja who is believed to have lived before Krishna. Bayana (near Mathura) from where the Jadus ruled ..." ''Against History, Against State: Counterperspectives from the Margins'', p 54, Shail Mayaram, published by Permanent Black, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic===
Gahlot and Banshidhar (1989) indicate some commonality in origin with Rajput Malis of Rajputana who are also stated to be of Rajput descent but these scholars add that out of the two the Sainis continued to maintain their Rajput character despite adoption of agriculture in the era of Muslim ascendancy.&lt;ref name = "Saini Rajput"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuAtAAAAMAAJ |quote=In the Punjab in the sub-mountainous region the community came to be known as 'Saini'.

''The Castes of Marwar, Being Census Report of 1891'', p vi, Hardyal Singh, Edition: 2, published by Books Treasure, Original from the University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;  Dak (1994), writing for Anthropological Survey of India, also clarified the difference for the Sainis of Haryana &lt;ref&gt;"Many of them are large landowners. Besides during the past, the Malis had served the royal courts and were mainly working as gardners; but the Sainis did not serve others; rather they were independent agriculturists. Arain, Rain, Baghban, the Mali and the Maliar constitute a mixed body of men denoting occupation rather than caste...1) The Malis are not as rigid as the Sainis in accepting food from members of other castes; 2) Mali women were found working as agricultural labourers which is not the case with Saini women; 3) Educationally, occupationally, and economically, the Sainis are far better placed than are the Malis, and 4) Sainis are landownders and own large lands as compared to the Malis."

Bhatia, Anthropological Survey of India, published on behalf of Anthropological Survey of India by Manohar Publishers,1994&lt;/ref&gt;

===British era===

During the British period Sainis were classified as both a statutory agricultural tribe and a martial race.&lt;ref name="Mazumder2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajit K.

Some Saini landlords were also appointed as ''[[zaildar]]s'', or revenue-collectors, in various districts.&lt;ref name = "Hissar Zaildar"&gt;History of Hisar: From Inception to Independence, 1935–1947, p 312, M. M. Juneja, Published by Modern Book Co., 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Traditionally, Sainis have been married through Vedic ceremonies performed by Brahmins of [[Sanatani]] tradition. However, Sikh Sainis marry by Anand Karaj ritual.

According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]], "The Saini are endogamous community and observe exogamy at village and gotra level." Remarriage after the death of a spouse is permitted nowadays, as is divorce.&lt;ref&gt;People of India, National Series Volume VI, India's Communities N-Z, p 3090, KS Singh, Anthropological Survey of India, Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secularism]] in [[India]] means equal treatment of all religions by the state.

With  the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|42nd Amendment]] of the [[Constitution of India]] enacted in 1976,&lt;ref name="42amend"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment) Act, 1976|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend42.htm|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=1 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328040620/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend42.htm|archivedate=28 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Preamble to the Constitution asserted that India is a secular nation. However, neither India's constitution nor its laws define the relationship between religion and state. The laws implicitly require the state and its institutions to recognise and accept all religions, enforce parliamentary laws instead of religious laws, and respect pluralism.&lt;ref name="notionSecular"&gt;{{cite web|title="A skewed secularism?" by Christophe Jaffrelot|url=http://www.sacw.net/article2081.html|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=srws/&gt; India does not have an official [[state religion]]. In matters of law in modern India, however, the applicable code of law is unequal, and India's personal laws - on matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, alimony - varies with an individual's religion. Muslim Indians have [[Sharia]]-based [[Muslim Personal Law]], while Hindu, Christian and Sikh Indians live under [[common law]]. The attempt to respect unequal, religious law has created a number of issues in India such as acceptability of [[child marriage]],&lt;ref name=intoday&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/muslim-groups-want-minimum-marital-age-scrapped/1/311127.html Muslim groups want minimum marital age scrapped] M.G. Radhakrishnan, India Today (22 September 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; polygamy, unequal inheritance rights, extra judicial  unilateral divorce rights favorable to some males, and conflicting interpretations of religious books.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;&lt;ref name=zoya/&gt;

Secularism as practiced in India, with its marked differences with Western practice of secularism, is a controversial topic in India. Supporters of the Indian concept of secularism claim it respects. Supporters of this form of secularism claim that any attempt to introduce a [[Uniform civil code of India|uniform civil code]], that is equal laws for every citizen irrespective of his or her religion, would impose majoritarian Hindu sensibilities and ideals. &lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;&lt;ref name=ddace/&gt; Opponents argue that India's acceptance of Sharia and religious laws violates the principle of [[Equality before the law]].&lt;ref name=mansfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=dhume/&gt;

Secularism is a divisive, politically charged topic in India.&lt;ref name=dhume/&gt;&lt;ref name=avthomas/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Ellora, The Temple 2.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Ellora caves]], a world heritage site, are in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The 35 caves were carved into the vertical face of the Charanandri hills between the 5th and 10th centuries. The 12 Buddhist caves, 17 Hindu caves and 5 Jain caves, built in proximity, suggest religious co-existence and secular sentiments for diversity prevalent during pre-Islamic period of Indian history.&lt;ref&gt;Pia Brancaccio, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629568 The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: The Impact of the Laity], Ars Orientalis, Vol. 30, Supplement 1, (2000), pp. 41-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen, L. (2012). Carving Devotion in the Jain Caves at Ellora (Vol. 41). Brill, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Indian religions]] are known to have co-existed and evolved together for many centuries before the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|arrival of Islam]] in the 12th century, followed by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[British Raj|colonial]] era. [[Ashoka]] about 2200 years ago, [[Harsha]] about 1400 years ago accepted and patronised different religions.&lt;ref name=srws/&gt; The people in ancient [[South Asia]] had freedom of religion, and the state granted citizenship to each individual regardless of whether someone’s religion was Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or any other.&lt;ref name=avthomas/&gt; [[Ellora Caves|Ellora cave]] temples built next to each other between 5th and 10th centuries, for example, shows a coexistence of religions and a spirit of acceptance of different faiths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/243 Ellora Caves] UNESCO, World Heritage List (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brockman, N.

This approach to interfaith relations changed with the arrival of Islam and establishment of Delhi Sultanate in North India by the 12th century, followed by Deccan Sultanate in Central India.&lt;ref name=avthomas/&gt; The political doctrines of Islam, as well as its religious views were at odds with doctrines of Hinduism, Buddhism and other Indian religions.&lt;ref name=srws/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Makarand Paranjape (2009), Altered Destinations: Self, Society, and Nation in India, London, Anthem Press South Asian Studies, {{ISBN|978-1-84331-797-5}}, pp 150-152&lt;/ref&gt; New temples and monasteries were not allowed. As with Levant, Southeast Europe and Spain, Islamic rulers in India treated Hindus as [[dhimmis]] in exchange of annual payment of [[jizya]] taxes, in a sharia-based state jurisprudence. With the arrival of Mughal era, Sharia was imposed with continued zeal, with Akbar - the Mughal Emperor - as the first significant exception.&lt;ref name=avthomas/&gt; Akbar sought to fuse ideas, professed equality between Islam and other religions of India, forbade forced conversions to Islam, abolished religion-based discriminatory jizya taxes, and welcomed building of Hindu temples.&lt;ref&gt;See "Mughal Empire."

New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; However, the descendants of Akbar, particularly [[Aurangzeb]], reverted to treating Islam as the primary state religion, destruction of temples, and reimposed religion-based discriminatory jizya taxes.&lt;ref name=srws/&gt;

[[File:Akbar's Tomb at Sikandra.jpg|thumb|left|[[Akbar's tomb]] at Sikandra, near Agra India. Akbar's instruction for his mausoleum was that it incorporate elements from different religions including Islam and Hinduism.]]
After Aurangzeb, India came into control of [[East India Company]] and the [[British Raj]]. The colonial administrators did not separate religion from state, but marked the end of unequal hierarchy between Islam and Hinduism, and reintroduced the notion of equality before the law for Hindus, Christians and Muslims.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt; The British Empire sought commerce and trade, with a policy of neutrality to all of India’s diverse religions.&lt;ref name=avthomas/&gt; Before 1858, the Britishers followed the policy of patronizing and supporting the native religions as the earlier rulers had done.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, &lt;i&gt;Secularism in India&lt;/i&gt;, 2005 as cited by Shiv Shankar Das in "Buddha Dharma, Secular Laws and Bahujan Politics in Uttar Pradesh," &lt;i&gt;Madhya Pradesh Journal of Social Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, Vol.19. No.1, June 2014, p.121&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-19th century, the British Raj administered India, in matters related to marriage, inheritance of property and divorces, according to personal laws based on each Indian subject’s religion, according to interpretations of respective religious documents by Islamic jurists, Hindu pundits and other religious scholars. In 1864, the Raj eliminated all religious jurists, pandits and scholars because the interpretations of the same verse or religious document varied, the scholars and jurists disagreed with each other, and the process of justice had become inconsistent and suspiciously corrupt.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt; The late 19th century marked the arrival of Anglo-Hindu and Anglo-Muslim personal laws, where the governance did not separate the state and religion, but continued to differentiate and administer people based on their personal religion.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duncan and Derrett (1968), Religion, Law and the State in India, Free Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The British Raj provided the Indian Christians, Indian Zoroastrians and others with their own personal laws, such as the Indian Succession Act of 1850, Special Marriage Act of 1872 and other laws that were similar to Common Laws in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Nandini Chatterjee, The Making of Indian Secularism: Empire, Law and Christianity Macmillan, {{ISBN|9780230220058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rquote|right|For several years past it has been the cherished desire of the Muslims of British India that [[Common law|Customary Law]] should in no case take the place of Muslim Personal Law. The matter has been repeatedly agitated in the press as well as on the platform. The Jamiat-ul-Ulema-i-Hind, the greatest Moslem religious body has supported the demand and invited the attention of all concerned to the urgent necessity of introducing a measure to this effect.|Preamble to Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937|&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D3SO4Cacv8AC The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937] Universal Law Publishing, New Delhi; pp 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiclindia.com/Acts/Muslim%20Personal%20Law%20(shariat)%20Application%20Act%201937.pdf THE MUSLIM PERSONAL LAW (SHARIAT) APPLICATION ACT, 1937] ACT No. 26 OF 1937, Government of India&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the British administration provided India with a common law, it's divide and rule policy contributed to promoting discord between communities. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/08/partition-british-game-divide-rule-170808101655163.html Shashi Tharoor, "The Partition: The British game of 'divide and rule'" ] &lt;/ref&gt; The Morley-Minto reforms provided separate electorate to Muslims, justifying the demands of the Muslim league.

In the first half of 20th century, the British Raj faced increasing amounts of social activism for self-rule by a disparate groups such as those led by Hindu Gandhi and Muslim Jinnah; the colonial administration, under pressure, enacted a number of laws before India’s independence in 1947, that continue to be the laws of India in 2013. One such law enacted during the colonial era was the 1937 Indian Muslim Personal Law ([[Sharia]]t) Application Act, which instead of separating state and religion for Western secularism, did the reverse.&lt;ref name=desmith/&gt; 

It, along with additional laws such as Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act of 1939 that followed, established the principle that religious laws of Indian Muslims can be their personal laws. It also set the precedent that religious law, such as sharia, can overlap and supersede [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil laws]], that elected legislators may not revise or enact laws that supersede religious laws, that people of one nation need not live under the same laws, and that law enforcement process for different individuals shall depend on their religion.&lt;ref name=desmith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Larson&gt;Gerald James Larson (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HGV3noHZ1QMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Religion and Personal Law in Secular India: A Call to Judgment], Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-33990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Muslim Personal Law ([[Sharia]]t) Application Act of 1937 continues to be the law of land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while parliament-based, non-religious uniform civil code passed in mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (which includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandra Mallampalli, Christians and Public Life in Colonial India: Contending with Marginality (London, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The 7th schedule of Indian constitution places religious institutions, charities and trusts into so-called Concurrent List, which means that both the central government of India, and various state governments in India can make their own laws about religious institutions, charities and trusts. If there is a conflict between central government enacted law and state government law, then the central government law prevails. This principle of overlap, rather than separation of religion and state in India was further recognised in a series of constitutional amendments starting with Article 290 in 1956, to the addition of word ‘secular’ to the Preamble of Indian Constitution in 1975.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;&lt;ref name=srws&gt;Rajagopalan (2002), "Secularism in India", in Editor: William Safran, The Secular and the Sacred - Nation, Religion and Politics, Chapter 13, {{ISBN|978-0714683010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sera Mey monks in the main temple.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks at the [[Sera Monastery]] during a festival. The monastery was granted asylum by India and relocated to [[Mysore]] after the Chinese invasion of [[Tibet]].]]
The overlap of religion and state, through Concurrent List structure, has given various religions in India, state support to religious schools and personal laws. This state intervention while resonant with the dictates of each religion, are unequal and conflicting. For example, a 1951 Religious and Charitable Endowment Indian law allows state governments to forcibly take over, own and operate Hindu temples,&lt;ref&gt;KN Kumari (1998), History of the Hindu Religious Endowments in Andhra Pradesh, Northern Books, {{ISBN|978-8172110857}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collect revenue from offerings and redistribute that revenue to any non-temple purposes including maintenance of religious institutions opposed to the temple;&lt;ref&gt;Presler, F. A. (1983). The structure and consequences of temple policy in Tamil Nadu, 1967-81. Pacific Affairs, 56(2), 232-246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/10/02/results-billion-dollar-treasure-hunt-in-hindu-temple-to-be-revealed/ Results of billion dollar treasure hunt in Hindu temple to be revealed] Gene Koprowski, Fox News (2 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Indian law also allows Islamic religious schools to receive partial financial support from state and central government of India, to offer religious indoctrination, if the school agrees that the student has an option to opt out from religious indoctrination if he or she so asks, and that the school will not discriminate any student based on religion, race or other grounds. Educational institutions wholly owned and operated by government may not impart religious indoctrination, but religious sects and endowments may open their own school, impart religious indoctrination and have a right to partial state financial assistance.&lt;ref name=srws/&gt;

In matters of personal law, such as acceptable age of marriage for girls, female circumcision, polygamy, divorce and inheritance, Indian law permits each religious group to implement their religious law if the religion so dictates, otherwise the state laws apply. In terms of religions of India with significant populations, only Islam has religious laws in form of sharia which India allows as Muslim Personal Law.&lt;ref name=jenkins/&gt;

Secularism in India, thus, does not mean separation of religion from state. Instead, secularism in India means a state that is neutral to all religious groups. Religious laws in personal domain, particularly for Muslim Indians, supersede parliamentary laws in India; and currently, in some situations such as religious indoctrination schools the state partially finances certain religious schools. These differences have led a number of scholars&lt;ref name=ddace/&gt;&lt;ref name=madan&gt;Madan, T. N. (1987), Secularism in Its Place, Journal of Asian Studies, 46 (4): 747–759&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nandy A, A Billion Gandhis, Outlook India, 21 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; to declare that India is not a secular state, as the word [[secularism]] is widely understood in the West and elsewhere; rather it is a strategy for political goals in a nation with a complex history, and one that achieves the opposite of its stated intentions.

==Comparison with Western secularism==
In the West, the word secular implies three things: freedom of religion, equal citizenship to each citizen regardless of his or her religion, and the separation of religion and state.&lt;ref name=desmith&gt;Donald E Smith (2011), India as a Secular State, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|9781178595253}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the core principles in the constitution of Western democracies has been this separation, with the state asserting its political authority in matters of law, while accepting every individual’s right to pursue his or her own religion and the right of religion to shape its own concepts of spirituality. Everyone is equal under law, and subject to the same laws irrespective of his or her religion, in the West.

In contrast, in India, the word secular does not imply separation of religion and state. It means equal treatment of all religions.&lt;ref name=desmith/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iheu.org/content/secularism-india Secularism in India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192006/http://iheu.org/content/secularism-india |date=29 October 2013 }} R. A. Jahagirdar, IHEU (11 May 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law. The applicable personal law differ if an individual’s religion is Christianity, or Hindu.
The term secularism in India also differs from the French concept for secularity, namely [[Laicism|laïcité]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hurd (2008), The Politics of Secularism in International Relations, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; While the French concept demands absence of governmental institutions in religion, as well as absence of religion in governmental institutions and schools; the Indian concept, in contrast, provides financial support to religious schools and accepts religious law over governmental institutions. The Indian structure has created incentives for various religious denominations to start and maintain schools, impart religious education, and receive partial but significant financial support from the Indian government. Similarly, Indian government financially supports, regulates and administers the historic Hindu temples, Buddhist monasteries, and certain Christian religious institutions; this direct Indian government involvement in various religions is markedly different from Western secularism.&lt;ref name=ddace&gt;DD Acevedo (2013), Secularism in the Indian Context, Law &amp; Social Inquiry, Volume 38, Issue 1, pp 138-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Jacobsohn, The Wheel of Law: India’s Secularism in Comparative Constitutional Context, Princeton University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Indian concept of secularism, where religious laws supersede state laws and the state is expected to even-handedly involve itself in religion, is a controversial subject.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;&lt;ref name=duncan&gt;Craig Duncan, [http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/cduncan/340/shahbano.doc Shah Bano: The Dilemma of Religious Liberty and Sex Equality], Cornell University, Ithaca, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=madan/&gt; Any attempts and demand by the Indian populace to a uniform civil code is considered a threat to right to religious personal laws by Indian Muslims.&lt;ref name=srws/&gt;&lt;ref name=intoday/&gt;

In 1978, the Shah Bano case brought the secularism debate along with a demand for uniform civil code in India to the forefront.&lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;&lt;ref name=mansfield&gt;John H. Mansfield, "The Personal Laws or a Uniform Civil Code?" in Robert D. Baird, ed., Religion and Law in Independent India (Manohar Press, 1993), pp. 139-177&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah Bano was a 62-year-old Muslim Indian who was divorced by her husband of 44 years in 1978. Indian Muslim Personal Law required her husband to pay no alimony. Shah Bano sued for regular maintenance payments under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1978.&lt;ref name=mansfield/&gt;  Shah Bano won her case, as well appeals to the highest court. Along with alimony, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India wrote in his opinion just how unfairly Islamic personal laws treated women and thus how necessary it was for the nation to adopt a Uniform Civil Code. The Chief Justice further ruled that no authoritative text of Islam forbade the payment of regular maintenance to ex-wives.&lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenkins&gt;Laura Jenkins, [http://homepages.uc.edu/thro/shahbano/allshahbano.htm Shah Bano: Muslim Women’s Rights], University of Cincinnati, Ohio (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shah Bano ruling immediately triggered a controversy and mass demonstrations by Muslim men.  The Islamic Clergy and the Muslim Personal Law Board of India, argued against the ruling.&lt;ref name=jenkins/&gt;  Shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the Indian government with [[Rajiv Gandhi]] as Prime Minister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A concise history of India|author=Thomas R. Metcalf|publisher = Cambridge University Press|quote=Rajiv Gandhi cared little about the Shah Bano case himself, and no doubt would have preferred a common civil code; nevertheless he saw in the opposition to this supreme court decision a heaven-sent opportunity to draw Minority voters to the Congress cause.|page=257|year=2002|ISBN= 978-0-521-63974-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted a new law which deprived all Muslim women, and only Muslim women, of the right of maintenance guaranteed to women of Hindu, Christian, Parsees, Jews and other religions. Indian Muslims consider the new 1986 law, which selectively exempts them from maintenance payment to ex-wife because of their religion, as secular because it respects Muslim men’s religious rights and recognises that they are culturally different from Indian men and women of other religions. Muslim opponents argue that any attempt to introduce Uniform Civil Code, that is equal laws for every human being independent of his or her religion, would reflect majoritarian Hindu sensibilities and ideals.&lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirti Singh, "Obstacles to Women’s Rights in India," in Rebecca J. Cook, ed. Human Rights of Women:  National and International Perspectives (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994), pp. 375-396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic feminists===
The controversy is not limited to Hindu versus Muslim populations in India. The [[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminists]] movement in India, for example, claim&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Vatuk, Islamic Feminism in India: Indian Muslim Women Activists and the Reform of Muslim Personal Law, Modern Asian Studies, Volume 42, Issue 2-3, March 2008, pp 489-518&lt;/ref&gt; that the issue with Muslim Personal Law in India is a historic and ongoing misinterpretation of the Quran. The feminists claim that the Quran grants Muslim women rights that in practice are routinely denied to them by male Muslim [[ulema]] in India. They claim that the &amp;lsquo;patriarchal&amp;rsquo; interpretations of the Quran on the illiterate Muslim Indian masses is abusive, and they demand that they have a right to read the Quran for themselves and interpret it in a woman-friendly way. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}India has no legal mechanism to accept or enforce the demands of these Islamic feminists over religious law.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Women’s rights in India===
Some religious rights granted by Indian concept of secularism, which are claimed as abusive against Indian women, include child marriage,&lt;ref name=intoday/&gt; polygamy, unequal inheritance rights of women and men, extrajudicial unilateral divorce rights of Muslim man that are not allowed to a Muslim woman, and subjective nature of shariat courts, ‘‘jamaats’’, ‘‘dar-ul quzat’’ and religious qazis who preside over Islamic family law matters.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;&lt;ref name=zoya&gt;Zoya Hasan and Ritu Menon (2005), The Diversity of Muslim Women's Lives in India, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8135-3703-0}}, pp 26-45, 59-64, 92-119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goa===
Goa is the only state in India which has Uniform Civil Code.The [http://mmascgoa.tripod.com/id12.html Goa Civil Code], also called the Goa Family Law, is the set of civil laws that governs the residents of the Indian state of Goa. In India, as a whole, there are religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of different religions. Goa is an exception to that rule, in that a single secular  code/law governs all Goans, irrespective of religion, ethnicity or linguistic affiliation.

===Article 25(2)(b)===
Article 25(2)(b) of the Indian constitution clubs Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains along with Hindus, a position contested by some of these community leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sikhsiyasat.net/2015/01/28/obama-affirms-indian-constitutions-article-25-over-objections-of-south-asian-americans/|title=Obama Affirms Indian Constitution’s Article 25 Over Objections of South Asian Americans|work=Sikh Siyasat News|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the [[Wall Street Journal]], [[Sadanand Dhume]] criticises Indian "Secularism" as a fraud and a failure, since it isn't really "secularism" as it is understood in the western world (as [[separation of religion and state]]) but more along the lines of religious [[appeasement]]. He writes that the flawed understanding of secularism among India's left wing [[intelligentsia]] has led [[Indian National Congress|Indian politician]]s to [[appeasement|pander]] to religious leaders and preachers including [[Zakir Naik]], and has led India to take a soft stand against [[Islamic terrorism]], religious militancy and [[Communalism (South Asia)|communal disharmony]] in general.&lt;ref name=dhume&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704365204575317833268479268?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEFTTopBucket | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=The Trouble with Dr. Zakir Naik | first=Sadanand | last=Dhume | date=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Ronald Inden]] writes:&lt;ref name="Inden"&gt;Imagining India, by Ronald Inden. Indiana University Press. 2000. p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Nehru's India was supposed to be committed to 'secularism'. The idea here in its weaker publicly reiterated form was that the government would not interfere in 'personal' religious matters and would create circumstances in which people of all religions could live in harmony. The idea in its stronger, unofficially stated form was that in order to modernise, India would have to set aside centuries of traditional religious ignorance and superstition and eventually eliminate Hinduism and Islam from people's lives altogether. After [[Partition of India|Independence]], governments implemented secularism mostly by refusing to recognise the religious pasts of [[Indian nationalism]], whether Hindu or Muslim, and at the same time (inconsistently) by retaining [[Sharia|Muslim 'personal law']] .&lt;ref name="Inden"/&gt;}}

[[Amartya Sen]], the Indian Nobel Laureate, suggests&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen (2006), The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity; {{ISBN|978-0312426026}}; Picador&lt;/ref&gt; that secularism in the political – as opposed to ecclesiastical – sense requires the separation of the state from any particular religious order. This, claims Sen, can be interpreted in at least two different ways: The first view argues the state be equidistant from all religions – refusing to take sides and having a neutral attitude towards them. The second view insists that the state must not have any relation at all with any religion. In both interpretations, secularism goes against giving any religion a privileged position in the activities of the state. Sen argues that the first form is more suited to India, where there is no demand that the state stay clear of any association with any religious matter whatsoever. Rather what is needed is to make sure that in so far as the state has to deal with different religions and members of different religious communities, there must be a basic symmetry of treatment. Sen does not claim that modern India is symmetric in its treatment or offer any views of whether acceptance of [[sharia]] in matters such as child marriage is equivalent to having a neutral attitude towards a religion. Critics of Sen claim that secularism as practised in India is not the secularism of first or second variety Sen enumerates.&lt;ref&gt;Minhaz Merchant, Amartya Sen and the ayatollahs of secularism – part 3, ''The Times of India'', 24 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Taslima Nasreen]] sees Indian secularists as pseudo secularist, accusing them of being biased towards Muslims saying, "Most secular people are pro-Muslims and anti-Hindu. They protest against the acts of Hindu fundamentalists and defend the heinous acts of Muslim fundamentalists". She also said that most Indian politicians appease Muslims which leads to anger among Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indian-writers-guilty-of-double-standards-when-it-comes-to-dissent-Taslima-Nasrin/articleshow/49425201.cms|title=Indian writers guilty of double standards when it comes to dissent: Taslima Nasrin|work=The Times of India|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani columnist Farman Nawaz in his article "Why Indian Muslim Ullema are not popular in Pakistan?" states "[[Maulana Arshad Madani]] stated that seventy years ago the cause of division of India was [[sectarianism]] and if today again the same temptation will raise its head then results will be the same. Maulana Arshad Madani considers secularism inevitable for the unity of India". Maulana Arshad Madani is a stanch critic of sectarianism in India. He is of the opinion that India was divided in 1947 because of sectarianism. He suggests [[secularism]] inevitable for the solidarity and integrity of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepashtuntimes.com/why-indian-muslim-ullema-are-not-popular-in-pakistan/|title=Why Indian Muslim Ullema are not popular in Pakistan?|work= The Pashtun Times |author=Farman Nawaz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sikhs]] are adherents to [[Sikhism]] the fifth largest organized religion in the world, with around 27 million adherents. Sikh History is around 500 years and in that time the Sikhs have developed unique expressions of art and culture which are influenced by their faith and synthesize traditions from many other cultures. Sikhism is Punjab's only indigenous religion with all other religions coming from outside Punjab (with the possible exception of Punjabi Hinduism since the oldest Hindu scripture – the Rig Veda – was composed in the [[Punjab region]].  Some other religions, like Jainism, may also claim to have originated in Punjab since Jain symbolism has been found among artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization).  All the Sikh gurus, saints and majority of the martyrs in Sikh history were from Punjab and from the [[Punjabi people]]. [[Punjabi culture]] and Sikhism are considered inseparably intertwined. "Sikh" properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a religion, not an ethnic group. However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong [[Ethnoreligious group|ethno-religious]] ties. Many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], therefore recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== The Sikh Art, Culture entertainment with Punjabi culture ==

Sikh art and culture is synonymous with that of the [[Punjab region]].  The Punjab itself has been called "India’s melting pot",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craftsbridge.com/craftsbridge/scripts/gotofacts?url=/information/regions/punjab/pnlife.htm the Crafts of the Punjab]&lt;/ref&gt; due to the confluence of invading cultures, such as [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]], that mirrors the confluence of rivers from which the region gets its name.  Thus, Sikh culture is to a large extent informed by this synthesis.

[[Sikhism]] has forged a unique form of [[Sikh architecture|architecture]] which Bhatti describes as being "inspired by [[Guru Nanak]]’s creative mysticism" such that [[Sikh architecture]] "is a mute harbinger of holistic humanism based on pragmatic spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punjabheritage.org/catagories/architectural-heritage/the-magnificence-of-sikh-architecture.html The magnificence of Sikh architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214193843/http://www.punjabheritage.org/catagories/architectural-heritage/the-magnificence-of-sikh-architecture.html |date=2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The keynote of Sikh architecture is the [[Gurdwara]] which is the personification of the "melting pot" of [[Punjabi culture]]s, showing both [[Islamic]], [[Sufi]] and [[Hindu]] influences.
The reign of the [[Sikh Empire]] was the single biggest catylst in creating a uniquely Sikh form of expression, with Maharajah [[Ranjit Singh]] patronising the building of forts, palaces, bungas (residential places), colleges, etc. that can be said to be of the ''Sikh Style''.  The "jewel in the crown" of the ''Sikh Style'' is the [[Harmandir Sahib]].

Sikh culture is heavily influenced by militaristic motifs, with [[Khanda (Sikh symbol)|Khanda]] being the most obvious; thus it is no surprise that the majority of Sikh artifacts, independent of the relics of the [[Gurus]], have a military theme.  This motif is again evident in the Sikh festivals of [[Hola Mohalla]] and [[Vasakhi]] which feature marching and practicing displays of valor respectively.

The art and culture of the [[Sikh diaspora]] has been merged with that of other indo-immigrant groups into categories such as 'British Asian', 'Indo-Canadanian' and 'Desi-Culture'; however there has emerged a niche cultural phenomenon that can be described as 'Political Sikh'.  The art of prominent [[Sikh diaspora|diaspora Sikhs]] such as Amarjeet Kaur Nandhra&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artministry.co.uk/services/delta_cms/content/communitygroup.aspx?GroupID=104 Textile artist Amarjeet Kaur Nandhra]&lt;/ref&gt;  and Amrit and Rabindra Kaur Singh ('The Singh Twins'),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sikhchic.com/article-detail.php?id=168&amp;cat=1 Singh Twins Art Launches Liverpool Fest]&lt;/ref&gt; is partly informed by their Sikh heritage and the current affairs of the Punjab.

==Culture of Sikh communities==
Although the Punjabi Sikhs form the majority of the Sikh population, the Sikh community is varied and includes people who speak the [[Assamese language]], the [[Kashmiri language]], the [[Telugu language]] and many more. The many communities following Sikhism is detailed below.

===Afghani Sikhs===

===Assamese Sikhs===
Although the ancestors of the Sikhs of [[Assam]] were from Punjab, the Assamese Sikhs have been living in [[Assam]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sikhinstitute.org/sikhs_living_outside/5-himadribanerjee.html Himadri Banerjee Institute of Sikh Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; for over 200 years. The community traces its origins to the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh who took his army to Assam. According to the 2001 census, there were 22,519 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] in [[Assam]],&lt;ref name="Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_data_finder/C_Series/Population_by_religious_communities.htm|title=Census of India 2001: Population by religious communities|author=Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner|year=2001|work=|publisher=[[Government of India]]|accessdate=3 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; out of which 4,000 are Assamese Sikhs.&lt;ref name="The Tribune Surjit Hans 24 08 2003"&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030824/spectrum/book8.htm The Tribune Surjit Hans 24 08 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assamese Sikhs follow the Sikh religion and celebrate Sikh festivals. However, they also celebrate local festivals such as [[Magh Bihu]] and wear traditional Assamese dress. Their language is the [[Assamese language]].&lt;ref name="The Tribune Surjit Hans 24 08 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/244159/though-nearly-200-years-assam.html Deccan Hrald 23 04 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrahari Sikhs===
[[Agrahari Sikh]] is a [[Sikh]] community found in [[eastern India]] including state [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]]. Agrahari Sikhs, also known as '''Bihari Sikhs''', have lived for centuries in [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Dakhni Sikhs===
Dakhni Sikhs are the descendants of the Sikh soldiers who came to the South in the early 19th century when the Nizam of Hyderabad raised a Sikh contingent in his army.&lt;ref name="Zee New 18 10 2011"&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/away-from-punjab-the-south-indian-sikhs_737141.html Zee New 18 10 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dakhani Sikhs are the descendants of Sikh soldiers sent by Maharaja Ranjit Singh to support the Nizam.  After the death of the Maharaja, the soldiers who remained there, married local women and adopted their language and culture. The traditional dress of women is the saree. The native language of Dakhni Sikhs is the [[Telugu language]]&lt;ref&gt;The Tribune 28 10 2014 Birinder Pal Singh&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kashmiri Sikhs===
Ethnic Kashmiri Sikhs speak the [[Kashmiri language]] and observe Kashmiri culture. They trace their ancestry to the Sikh soldiers who settled in [[Kashmir]] under the Maharaja Ranjit Singh rule in 1819. However, the soldiers permanently settled in [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5cXqAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=kashmiri+sikhs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Idkr26mDIO&amp;sig=EUl7Ykf3z1qKai7U2Varv3R2GjU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kmtqVJO6ONLUapq4gagE&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=kashmiri%20sikhs&amp;f=false Kashur The Kashmiri Speaking People By Mohini Qasba Raina]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punjabi Sikhs===
Punjabi Sikhs follow the [[Punjabi culture]]. Their traditional dress includes the [[Punjabi Salwar Suit]], [[Punjabi Tamba and Kurta]], [[Punjabi juti]] and [[Patiala salwar]].

In addition to the [[List of Sikh festivals|Sikh festivals]]  using the [[Nanakshahi calendar]], Punjabi Sikhs observe traditional [[Punjabi festivals]] using the [[Punjabi calendar]].

[[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]] and the [[Giddha]] are two forms of indigenous Punjabi folk dancing that have been appropriated, adapted and pioneered by Punjabi Sikhs.  The Punjabi Sikhs have championed these forms of expression all over the world, such that Sikh Culture has become inextricably linked to Bhangra, even though "Bhangra is not a Sikh institution but a Punjabi one."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhwomen.com/sikhism/culture_arts/bhangra.htm Bhangra &amp; Sikhi by Harjinder Singh]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sindhi Sikhs===
{{main |Sindhis in India}}
In addition to celebrating Sikh festivals, Sindhi Sikhs celebrate festivals such as [[Cheti Chand]], the Sindhi new year. Sindhi Sikhs speak the [[Sindhi language]].

===South Indian Sikhs===
There are [[Sikh]] communities in [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Maharashtra]] who settled there centuries ago.

The Sikhs comprise [[Banjara]] and Satnami. The process of blending into southern India for the Sikligars began at the time of 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh, who came to the Deccan and died in 1708 at Nanded (Maharashtra).

Sikligars came to southern India as expert arms-making camp followers of the tenth Guru. Sikligar is a compound of the Persian words `saiqal` and `gar` meaning a polisher of metal.&lt;ref name="Zee New 18 10 2011"/&gt; The traditional occupation of the [[Sikligar]]s is crafting kitchen implements.

Banjaras are a nomadic tribe who traditionally travelled with merchandise and are found across a large swathe of northern India, as well as in the south. Sikh Banjaras too travelled with armies of the past supplying them with provisions.&lt;ref name="Zee New 18 10 2011"/&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''Skandha''' (Sanskrit) means "heaps, aggregates, collections, groupings". In contrast to [[Buddhism]] that says Skandha is without any underlying substance or identity, [[Jainism]] posits that all Skandhas are ultimately backed by a combination of  [[Paramanu|Paramanus]] or elementary particles that are indestructible and uncreatable. Skandha is nothing but a combination of [[Paramanu|Paramanus]] (elementary particles). Jainism doesn't include the last four types of aggregates of Buddhism because those phenomena are explained in Jainism by the groupings between fine matter called ([[Karma in Jainism|karma particles]], second last from the list below) and [[Atman (Jainism)|Atman]] [[Dravya|Substance]] (unified individual whose existence is denied in Buddhism). A grouping between matter and Atman is not considered a Skandha but is considered a [[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha (bondage)]].

Each Paramanu has "intensity points" of aridness or cohesiveness that, because of transformation, can increase or decrease between one and infinity. These Paramanus can combine with each other to create Skandhas or Aggregates when there is a difference of two "intensity points", whether it is arid or cohesive or whether having even or odd "intensity points" except the minimum (one) "intensity point". For example, a paramanu with two points of cohesiveness can combine with a [[paramanu]] of four points of cohesiveness or aridness; and that of three points with that of five points and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pages=545–546|title=Pravachansaara|url=https://ia801904.us.archive.org/1/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.321516/2015.321516.Pravachanasara.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is given in [[Pravachanasara]].

Skandhas and Paramanus are two types of [[Pudgala]]s (Matter).

Skandha are of six types: Gross-gross, gross, gross-fine, fine-gross, fine, and fine-fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=27|title=Niyamsara|url=https://ia600209.us.archive.org/27/items/Niyamsara/Niyamsara%20%28The%20Perfect%20Law%29_text.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is given in [[Niyamsara]].
# Gross-gross: Solids, such as stone and wood, that when broken cannot be united again by themselves.
# Gross: Milk, water, etc. separated but can unite without any help.
# Gross-fine: The sunlight, shade, moon light, darkness etc. One is not able to split them. One is not able to  grab them with his hands.
# Fine-gross: The objects of the four senses of touch, taste, smell, and hearing are even though are known by skin, tongue, nose and ears but still cannot be perceived by eyes and that is why they are fine-gross in nature.
# Fine: The matter particles of the [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] are fine in nature and cannot be perceived by any of the physical senses.
# Fine-fine: Finer than the karma particles are extremely fine in nature. They are finer than karma particles.

'''Taipei Ricci Institute''' ('''TRI''') in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], is one of four [[Ricci Institutes]].

==History==
Heir to the spirit of [[Matteo Ricci]]’s methods of evangelization in China in the 17th century, the Taipei Ricci Institute was established in 1966 by Father Yves Raguin, S.J. (1912-1998) and other [[Jesuit]] [[sinologist]]s who were working on a multi-linguistic dictionary project launched around 1950 in [[Macau]]. Working on Chinese languages and religions, this institution revived the “Bureau d’Etudes Sinologiques” created in 1892 by the French Jesuits of [[Shanghai]] and its publication ''Variétés Sinologiques''. The TRI keeps the editorial direction of the ''Variétés sinologiques'' today.

What is now known as the “Taipei Ricci Institute” was and is officially named “Ricci Institute, Center for Chinese Studies”. The creation of other Ricci Institutes has enlarged the network and the influences of this institution.

In 1996, [[Benoît Vermander]], S.J. succeeded to [[Yves Raguin]], taking over the running of the TRI. Accrued interaction with mainland China led to a redefinition of the tasks of the institute, now defined as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;to carry on dialogue and reflection towards and within the Chinese world, in order to make China become positive and active partner of globalization, thanks to a reinterpretation of its cultural resources. “Cultural diversity”, “sustainable development” and “spiritual empowerment” are the three poles of development that the TRI constructs in confronting challenges and debates present in today’s China.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Works==
At the beginning, the TRI had two goals:

*To achieve the preparation and publication of dictionaries, work started in 1950. Since the 1970s, some middle-sized dictionaries have been published: Chinese-French, Chinese-Spanish and Chinese-Hungarian. Le [[Grand Ricci]], the most important dictionary, was published in 2002: It includes seven volumes, 9,000 pages, 13,500 words and more than 300,000 definitions. It is recognized as the most complete Chinese-foreign language dictionary in the world.
*To conduct studies of comparative spirituality, with a special interest for Chinese Taoism and Buddhism. Yves Raguin has published about 20 books on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005320/http://www.riccibase.com/page_b5/s-intro/Raguin.htm 禱念甘易逢神父     Father Yves Raguin, In Memoriam]&lt;/ref&gt; (See www.riccibase.com.) His works reflect an effort on dialogue with the other religions and trends of philosophical thinking, that were emphasized in Council Vatican II.

==TRI publications==
Besides the ''Dictionnaire Ricci de la langue chinoise'' (or Le [[Grand Ricci]]) TRI has authored or published more than 20 books in the field of Chinese studies, in Chinese, French and English, during the last decade, with special emphasis on oracular inscriptions, philosophy of peace and minority languages. Especially noteworthy is the publication of ''Chinese Christian Texts from the Roman Archives of the Society of Jesus''. This collection of 12 volumes contains a selection of hitherto unpublished texts.

===Renlai monthly===
''Renlai magazine'' (“human flute-or voice”), a Chinese expression created by [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], Taoist philosopher, is a monthly magazine written in Chinese, published in [[Taipei]] since January 2004. This magazine is mainly concerned with social, spiritual and cultural topics. Edited by Renlai staff and TRI, the magazine is published in association with the French Jesuit review ''[[Etudes]]''. Since 2006, TRI has started an internet magazine ''eRenlai'' [http://www.erenlai.com/ www.erenlai.com], available in English, Chinese, both traditional and simplified. Renlai and eRenlai are particularly concerned about questions such as sustainable development, cultural diversity and mobilization of spiritual resources in the Chinese world.

'''Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram''' is an Indian social welfare organization based in [[Jashpur]], in the [[Chhattisgarh]] state of India. It focuses on the welfare activities of Janjatis that is Scheduled Tribes in remote areas of Bharat (India) and has branches throughout the country. These branches focus on agriculture, healthcare, child education, and sports. It also works to create cultural awareness among janjatis thereby facilitating the idea of preservation of their tradition and customs followed in different groups.  &lt;ref name=govind&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Ashram was founded in 1952 by [[Ramakant Keshav Deshpande]], (Also known as Balasaheb Deshpande) an official of the [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] State Department of Tribal Welfare, with the support of the State Government and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. After Independence, Balasaheb was appointed by the then Ravi Shankar Shukla Government to work in tribal dominated Jashpur area as ‘Regional Officer’ of the ‘Tribal Development Scheme’. This particular area had gone into the iron grip of the Christian missionaries who had converted the simple tribal people to their religion by using all means fair and foul. Their conversion to Christianity had alienated them from the cultural and national moorings. Its aim was to counter the appeal of Christian missionary schools to the tribals. Based in Jashpur (214&amp;nbsp;km from [[Raigarh]]), it established schools in [[Raigarh district|Raigarh]] and [[Surguja district]]s - areas with large tribal populations. The Ashram grew rapidly and a permanent office was established in 1963, inaugurated by the RSS chief [[M. S. Golwalkar]].&lt;ref name="jaffrelot" /&gt;

In 1977, during the [[Premiership of Morarji Desai|Janata Party Government]], it acquired national status (expressed in its new name, ''Bhāratiya Vanavāsi Kalyān Āshram''). From 1978 to 1983, the number of its full-time volunteers rose from 44 to 264 (56 of whom were tribal). In Jashpur, a hospital was established, and schools, hotels, and centers for apprenticeship in manual trades were also established in 40 villages. The programs are presently located in 312 districts throughout the country and are supervised by more than a thousand full-time workers. While most districts have primary schools, many other places have residential schools, hostels, libraries, and health centers. Important annual events include establishing medical camps, playing traditional sports, and celebrating tribal festivals.&lt;ref name=jaffrelot&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaffrelot|first=Christophe|title=The Hindu nationalist movement and Indian politics: 1925 to the 1990|year=1996|publisher=C Hurst &amp; Co.

===Economic development===
The tribal communities in India suffer from a lack of both education and proper health care facilities due to various factors including government neglect. As a result, the communities often have a sense of alienation from present-day India which is being rapidly urbanized and westernized. To bring them into the mainstream with economic development but with their cultural moorings intact is an important role of the Kalyan Ashram. The Vanavasi Ashram helps the communities protect their interests and assists them to solve their own problems.&lt;ref name=aiming/&gt;

The Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram helps with the formation of people's self-help groups. It also encourages smaller gatherings in post offices, provides training for scientific cultivation of cash crops, distributes seeds and seedlings, and helps arrange local resources for irrigation. It also helps widows and the elderly get their pensions. The Ashram increases people's awareness by organizing occasional symposiums on current issues like "Impact of Globalization and Liberalization on Tribal Life" and publishing books and periodicals dealing with socio-cultural aspects of day-to-day tribal life.&lt;ref name=govind/&gt;

The Ashram, by providing the basic amenities like health care, employment, and education, helps the tribes avoid activity that can hamper their development. Their efforts are also directed at conflict resolution between the different tribes, which sometimes clash amongst themselves over petty issues. The Ashram has been promoting the concept that all the tribal groups belong to India and hence are one.&lt;ref name=aiming/&gt;

===Education===
[[File:Vanavasi kalyan Ashram sidhis.jpg|thumb|right|300px|At a school of Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram for the [[Siddi]]s of North Karnataka]]
The Ashram has a network of single teacher schools (''Ekal Vidyalaya'') across tribal areas where there are no government schools, based on [[Swami Vivekananda]]'s saying, "If the mountain does not come to Mohammed, Mohammed must go to the mountain. If the poor cannot come to education, education must reach them at the plough, in the factory, everywhere." Many tribal people are now serving in higher government posts at the central and state level. Almost 90% of Hindi teachers in Nagaland state are products of Kalyan Ashram hostels, as well as one medical officer serving in the central government in Delhi. Many of the Ashram's former students have been selected for state police services.&lt;ref name=aiming/&gt;

===Tribal sports===
[[File:Vanvasi kalyan archery competetion.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Archery competition conducted by Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram for tribal brothers]]
The Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram has hundreds of sports facilities and centers across the tribal areas of the countries that promote tribal sports, especially archery. Students from schools and hostels run by the organization have won laurels in archery at national and international levels.&lt;ref name=aiming/&gt;

====Archery====
Accomplished Indian archer and [[Padma Shri]] recipient [[Limba Ram]], whose family belongs to the Ahari tribe, was a student of the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram in [[Saradeet]] Village,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Rajasthan who would go on to win many medals as well as represent India thrice at the [[Olympic Games]]. Many other students from different schools of the Ashram across India have won medals at state and national levels in games conducted by the [[Sports Authority of India]]. The Ashram has various centers across the country where basic infrastructure is provided to train them in archery and help them preserve the tribal games.&lt;ref name="aiming"&gt;"Aiming high: Vanavasi Kalyana Ashram is helping tribal groups achieve self-reliance", ''The Hindu'', Feb 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kavita Raut]], a medalist in the 10,000-meter run at the [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and [[Asian Games]], and who studied at Vishva Hindu Parishad Nasik, now trains at SAI Bangalore for better performance for the forthcoming Olympic games.

===Protecting culture===
The Vanavāsis ("Tribals") were called ''[[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginals]]'' and made victims of the [[Divide and rule#India|divide and rule]] policy of the [[United Kingdom|British]]. They were declared to be ''[[animists]]'' with no religion worth the name.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The tribal regions were scaled off as "Protected Areas" to all except Christian missionaries.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Now, the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram has begun working in those areas. Sanskar Kendras for women and children, schools, hostels, reading rooms, free dispensaries, and village and cottage industries have been started and are increasing in number throughout  all the provinces.

The Ashram helps the tribes protect their rich cultures. It organizes performances of traditional folklore and dances like [[Kolatam]], [[Chakka Bhajana]] and [[Dhimsa]] dance.&lt;ref name=aiming/&gt; Among the several events, the important ones include medical camps, traditional sports, and the celebration of Tribal festivals as well as major Hindu festivals, like [[Raksha Bandhan]], [[Hanuman Jayanti]], [[Ram Navami]], [[Govardhan Puja]], Indal Pooja and [[Krishna Janmashtami]].&lt;ref name=govind/&gt;

'''''We the Living''''' is the [[debut novel]] of the [[Russian Americans|Russian American]] novelist [[Ayn Rand]]. It is a story of life in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|post-revolutionary Russia]] and was Rand's first statement against [[communism]]. Rand observes in the foreword that ''We the Living'' was the closest she would ever come to writing an autobiography. Rand finished writing the novel in 1934, but it was rejected by several publishers before being released by [[Macmillan Publishing]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="Ralston165"&gt;Ralston, Richard E. "Publishing ''We the Living''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2012|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since sold more than three million copies.&lt;ref name="Ralston169"&gt;Ralston, Richard E. "Publishing ''We the Living''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2012|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story takes place from 1922 to 1925, in post-[[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolutionary Russia]]. Kira Argounova, the protagonist of the story, is the younger daughter of a [[bourgeois]] family. An independent spirit with a will to match, she rejects any attempt by her family or the nascent Soviet state to cast her into a mold. At the beginning of the story, Kira returns to [[Petrograd]] with her family, after a prolonged exile due to the assault of the [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries. Kira's father had been the owner of a textile factory, which was seized and [[nationalized]]. Having given up all hopes of regaining their past possessions after the victories of the [[Red Army]], the family returns to the city in search of livelihood. They find that their home has also been seized and converted to living quarters for several families.

Kira's family eventually manages to find living quarters, and Kira's father gets a license to open a textile shop, an establishment that is but a shadow of his old firm. Life is excruciatingly difficult in these times. Rand portrays long queues, weary citizens and low standards of living. With some effort, Kira manages to obtain her Labor Book, which permits her to study and work. Kira also manages to enroll in the Technological Institute, where she aspires to fulfill her dream of becoming an [[engineer]]. At the Institute, Kira meets Andrei Taganov, a co-student, an idealistic Communist and an officer in the Soviet [[secret police]]. The two share a mutual respect and admiration for each other in spite of their differing political beliefs, and become friends.

[[File:Wetheliving100.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''We the Living'', Centennial edition.]]
In a chance encounter, Kira meets Leo Kovalensky, an attractive man with a free spirit. It is love at first sight for Kira, and she throws herself at Leo, who initially takes her to be a prostitute. He is also strongly attracted to her and promises to meet her again. Kira and Leo are shown to be united by their desperate lives and their beliefs that run counter to what is being thrust on them by the state. After a couple of meetings, when they share their deep contempt for the state of their lives, the two plan to escape the country together.

From this point on, the novel slowly cascades into a series of catastrophes for Kira and Leo. They are caught while attempting to flee the country, but escape imprisonment with the help of an official who knew Leo's father before the revolution. Kira leaves her parents' apartment and moves into Leo's. Soon the state decides to expel any college students of a bourgeois background, and Kira is also fired from her job. The relationship between Kira and Leo, intense and passionate in the beginning, begins to deteriorate under the weight of their hardships and their different reactions. Kira keeps her ideas and aspirations alive, but decides to go along with the system until she feels powerful enough to challenge it. Leo, in contrast, sinks slowly into indifference and depression. He contracts tuberculosis and is prescribed treatment in a sanatorium. Kira's efforts to finance his treatment fail, and her appeals to the authorities to get state help fall on deaf ears.

As Kira's relationship with Leo evolves, so does her relationship with Andrei. Despite their political differences, she finds Andrei to be the one person with whom she could discuss her most intimate thoughts and views. Andrei's affection and respect for Kira slowly turns into love. When he confesses his love to Kira, she is dismayed but also desperate, so she feigns love for Andrei and agrees to become his mistress. She uses money from Andrei to fund Leo's treatment.

Leo returns cured of tuberculosis and healthy, but a changed man. He opens a food store that is a facade for [[black market]] trade. Andrei, who is concerned that corruption is damaging the communist state, starts investigating Leo's store. He arrests Leo and in the process discovers that Kira has secretly been living with Leo. Disillusioned about both his personal relationship and his political ideals, Andrei secures Leo's release and shortly thereafter commits suicide. Kira, perhaps the only genuine mourner at his state funeral, wonders if she has killed him. Having lost any moral sense that he may have left, Leo leaves Kira to begin a new life as a [[gigolo]]. After Leo's departure, Kira makes a final attempt to cross the border. Almost in sight of freedom, she is shot by a border guard and dies.

==Publication history==


===Initial publication===
The novel was first completed in 1934, under the working title ''Airtight''. Despite support from [[H. L. Mencken]], who deemed it "a really excellent piece of work",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|pp=10, 13–14}}; Ralston, Richard E. "Publishing ''We the Living''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2012|pp=160–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was rejected by several publishers until September 1935, when [[George Platt Brett]] of [[Macmillan Publishing]] agreed to publish it. Brett's decision was not without controversy within Macmillan. Associate editor [[Granville Hicks]], then a member of the [[American Communist Party]], was strongly opposed to publishing Rand's novel. Rand later said that Brett was unsure whether the novel would turn a profit, but he thought it was a book that ought to be published. The first edition was issued on April 7, 1936.&lt;ref name="Ralston165" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial American publication of ''We the Living'' was not a commercial success. Macmillan did not expect the novel to sell and did little marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sales were slow and although they picked up later, Macmillan destroyed the plates before the first printing of 3000 copies sold out. Eighteen months after its release, the novel was out of print.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. "Publishing ''We the Living''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2012|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's royalties from the first American edition amounted to $100.&lt;ref name="passion127"&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a British publication by Cassell in January 1937, and editions were published in Denmark and Italy. These did considerably better than the American release, remaining in print into the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. "Publishing ''We the Living''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2012|pp=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revised edition===
In 1957, Rand's novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' became a best-seller for [[Random House]]. Its success motivated them to republish ''We the Living'' in 1959. In preparation for the new edition, Rand made some changes to the text. In her Foreword to the revised edition, Rand declared that "In brief, all the changes are merely editorial line changes."&lt;ref name="Rand1959fore"&gt;Rand, Ayn (1959). ''We the Living'', p. xvii. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's description notwithstanding, some of the changes have been taken to have philosophical significance. In the first edition,&lt;ref name="1sted92"&gt;Rand, Ayn (1936). ''We the Living.'' New York: Macmillan, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Kira said to Andrei, "I loathe your ideals. I admire your methods." In the second edition, this became simply "I loathe your ideals." A few pages later, Kira said to Andrei, "What are your masses but mud to be ground underfoot, fuel to be burned for those who deserve it?"&lt;ref name="1sted95"&gt;Rand 1936, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rand's revision deleted this sentence.&lt;ref name="Merrill38"&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|1991|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of these and other revisions has been debated. Rand scholar [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] commented, "She claims that the revision was minimal. Some readers of both editions have questioned her definition of 'minimal'."&lt;ref name="Gladst35"&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ronald Merrill, Kira in the first edition "adopts in the most explicit terms possible the ethical position of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]."&lt;ref name="Merrill39"&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|1991|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand had made her break with Nietzsche by the time she published ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. Canadian writer [[Barbara Branden]] said that "Some of her readers were disturbed when they discovered this and similar changes",&lt;ref name="Branden114"&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; but insisted that "unlike Nietzsche, she rejected as unforgivably immoral any suggestion that the superior man had the right to use physical force as a means to his end."&lt;ref name="Branden115"&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Mayhew cautioned that "We should not conclude too quickly that these passages are strong evidence of an earlier Nietzschean phase in Ayn Rand's development, because such language can be strictly metaphorical (even if the result of an early interest in Nietzsche)".&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Robert. "''We the Living'' '36 and '59". {{harvnb|Mayhew|2012|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Love Brown countered that "Mayhew becomes an apologist for Rand's denials of change and smooths over the fact that Rand herself saw the error of her ways and corrected them."&lt;ref name="slbrown"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Susan Love |year=2006 |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's Fiction |journal=[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly everyone who reads ''We the Living'' today reads the second edition. The first is a rare book; the second has sold over three million copies.&lt;ref name="Ralston169" /&gt;

==Reception and influence==
Rand believed that ''We the Living'' was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says "it was the most reviewed of any of her works", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications.

When the book was released in Australia, it received several positive reviews. In the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', news editor [[Leslie Haylen]] described the novel as "very vivid, human, and wholly satisfying", saying it described Russian life without taking sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Leslie |last=Haylen |authorlink=Les Haylen |title=Woman's Book on Russia Rings True |work=[[Australian Women's Weekly]] |date=February 6, 1937 |page=14 |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52262525 |via=[[Trove]]}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Barrier Miner]]'' said it was "entertaining" and "intensely moving", and not at all propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''We the Living''; Fine Russian Story |work=[[The Barrier Miner]] |location=Broken Hill, New South Wales |date=March 22, 1937 |volume=19 |issue=14,839 |page=4 |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47935060  |via=[[Trove]]}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wodonga and Towong Sentinel'' called it a "vivid story" that showed Russia "dispassionately, without once imposing any preconceived ideas on the reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''We the Living'': A Remarkable New Novel |work=The Wodonga and Towong Sentinel |date=February 19, 1937 |issue=2567 |page=6 |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69629274 |via=[[Trove]]}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand scholar [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] compared it to two of her later novels, saying, "While it does not have the power of ''The Fountainhead'' or the majestic sweep of ''Atlas Shrugged'', ''We the Living'' is still a compelling story about interesting characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian James Baker said it was "preachy" and "indoctrinated without entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Play===
{{main article|The Unconquered (1940 play)}}
Shortly after the novel was published, Rand began negotiations with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producer Jerome Mayer to do a theatrical adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand wrote the script, but Mayer's financing fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, she was able to interest [[George Abbott]] in producing the play. [[Helen Craig (actress)|Helen Craig]] took the lead role as Kira, alongside [[John Emery (actor)|John Emery]] as Leo and [[Dean Jagger]] as Andrei. It opened under the title ''[[The Unconquered (1940 play)|The Unconquered]]'' at the [[Biltmore Theatre]] on February 13, 1940, but closed just five days later after scathing reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=126–129}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=150–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was not published during Rand's lifetime. In 2014, [[Palgrave Macmillan]] published a volume with both the final script and an earlier version, edited by Robert Mayhew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Svanberg|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
{{main article|We the Living (film)}}
''We the Living'' was published in an Italian translation in 1937. Without Rand's permission, it was adapted in 1942 as an Italian film, released in two parts, titled ''Noi Vivi'' (''We the Living'') and ''Addio Kira'' (''Goodbye Kira''). The films were directed by [[Goffredo Alessandrini]] for Scalera Films of Rome, and starred [[Alida Valli]] as Kira, [[Fosco Giachetti]] as Andrei, and [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Leo. Prior to their release, the films were nearly [[censorship|censored]] by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s government, but they were permitted because the story itself was set in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Russia and was directly critical of that regime. The films were successful, and the public easily realized that they were as much against [[fascism]] as [[communism]]. After several weeks, German authorities, who were allied with the Italian government, insisted that the film be pulled from distribution because of its anti-Fascist themes.

Rediscovered in the 1960s through the efforts of Rand's lawyers, [[Erika Holzer]] and Henry Mark Holzer, these films were re-edited into a new version with English subtitles composed by Erika Holzer and revision co-producer Duncan Scott. This version, approved by Rand and her estate, was re-released as ''We the Living'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{JewishMusic}}
'''Yemenite Jewish poetry''', often referred to as "[[Piyyut|paraliturgical poetry]]" because of its religious nature, has been an integral part of Yemenite Jewish culture since time immemorial. The [[Jews of Yemen]] have preserved a well-defined singing arrangement which not only includes the very poetic creation itself, but also involves a vocal and dance performance, accompanied in certain villages outside [[Sana'a]] by drumming on an empty tin-can (''tankah'') or a copper plate. The Jews of Yemen, maintaining strict adherence to Talmudic and Maimonidean [[halakha]], observed the [[gezeirah]] which prohibited playing&lt;ref&gt;While also "listening" to musical instruments is proscribed by Maimonides, before he brings down this prohibition, however, he first speaks about the prohibitions of playing musical instruments and of rejoicing at the playing thereof. Understandably, there were instances where the Jews in Yemen, by no fault of their own, would hear music from their Arab neighbors (note Halikhoth Teiman p. 288), and there was no practice to shut one's ears in Yemen upon hearing, in passing, an Arab playing a musical instrument.&lt;/ref&gt; musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Hilkoth Ta'niyyoth, Chapter 5, Halakhah 14 (see [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/951999/jewish/Taaniyot-Chapter-Five.htm#footnote14a951999 Touger commentary, footnote 14]); Responsa of Maimonides, siman 224 (ed. Blau [Jerusalem, 1960/2014]: vol. 2 p. 399 / vol. 4 [Rubin Mass and Makhon Moshe, Jerusalem, 2014] p. 137); Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]]'s commentary to Mishneh Torah, ibid., in note 27 following his citation of Maimonides' responsa, "לא דיים ששותים יין בכלי זמר שיש כבר שתי עברות כפי שמנה רבנו לעיל" (English: they drink wine with musical instruments, which alone involves two sins as our master enumerated above [prohibitions three and four of the five enumerated in responsum siman 224]). Rabbi Yosef Qafih's ''Collected Papers'', volume 2, השירה והלחנים בתפילת יהודי תימן (Hebrew), page 959: "אין יהודי תימן מלווים שירתם בכלי ואפילו שירים הנאמרים בבתי משתאות בגלל האיסור שבדבר, קל וחומר תפילתם, כך שאין יהודי תימן מכירים שירה בכלי כלל (מה שמקצת כפרים מלווים את שירת משתיהם על פח איני יודע אם ימצא מי שהוא שיקרא לזה כלי שיר) לא כלי הקשה לא כלי פריטה ולא כלי נשיפה." English translation "Yemenite Jews do not accompany their song with instruments–even songs said in houses of feasting–due to the prohibition of the matter, all the more so their prayers. Thus Yemenite Jews do not at all recognize song with instruments (that which some villages accompany the songs of their feasts by tin, I don't know if there's anyone who would call this a musical instrument), neither percussion instruments, string instruments, nor wind instruments."&lt;/ref&gt; and "instead of developing the playing of musical instruments, they perfected singing and rhythm."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzpuQjU0F6Q&amp;t=272 Spielberg Jewish Film Archive - Teiman: The Music of the Yemenite Jews: 4:32]–4:48: "Drumming was used by all. Mourning the destruction of the second temple resulted in the prohibition of using musical instruments. The Yemenites, stringent in their observance, accepted this ban literally. Instead of developing the playing of musical instruments, they perfected singing and rhythm."&lt;/ref&gt; (For the modern Yemenite-Israeli musical phenomenon see [[Music of Israel#Jewish Yemenite music|Yemenite Jewish music]].) This arrangement was integrated into the walks of life familiar to the Jews of Yemen. The texts used in the arrangement were put down in writing and later&lt;ref&gt;תורתן שלּבנֵי תימן (Yemenite Jewish Literature: Authors and their writings), Yehuda Ratzaby (Makhon Moshe; Kiryat Ono, 1995), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; included in separate song collections (''dīwāns''). The social strictures and norms in Yemenite Jewish culture provide for separate settings for men and for women, where the sexes are never mixed. Men’s song usually expressed the national aspirations of the Jewish people,&lt;ref&gt;David Solomon Sassoon, ''Ohel Dawid - Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library'', London, vol. 1 (Introduction), Oxford University Press:London 1932, p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was far removed from the singing associated with the [[Muslim]] environment, whereas folk songs of Jewish women were sung by rote memory (unwritten poetry) and expressed the happiness and sorrows inherent in their daily life and was, as a rule, closer to that of Muslim women.&lt;ref&gt;Mishael Maswari Caspi, ''Popular Language and Rhyme in Yemenite Poetry'', Hebrew Abstracts, Vol. 14 (1973), published by the National Association of Professors of Hebrew (NAPH), pp. 87, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
In terms of the formal structure, men’s songs during social gatherings among Yemenite Jews are of three genres: ''[[nashīd]]'' (introduction), ''shirah'' (poem) and ''hallel'' (praise).&lt;ref&gt;Spielberg Jewish Film Archive - Teiman: The Music of the Yemenite Jews: "The Diwan, the basis of all songs for men, is always divided into three parts. The first part, called the nashid, is an introduction, always sung by a soloist." ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzpuQjU0F6Q&amp;t=299 4:59]–5:11)... "The nashid concludes with a paraphrased verse from the book of songs, chanted in a set melody, which serves as a bridge to the second part called shirah." ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzpuQjU0F6Q&amp;t=322 5:22]–5:31)... "At the end of the shirah the singer recites the last line. This, signals the beginning of the third part of the diwan, the hallel. The hallel begins and ends with the word haleluya. It is always sung to a fixed melody, a living testimony of the most ancient sounds of Jewish music that, despite the millennia of exile in Yemen, remain unchanged." ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzpuQjU0F6Q&amp;t=503 8:23]–9:02)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nashīd'' is written in the form of a classical Arabic ''[[Qasida|qaṣīda]]''.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt; All songs of praise are always preceded by a song of supplication and of entreaties, known in Arabic as a ''nashīd''. The ''shirah'' (poem) is a Hebrew term denoting two known structures taken from Arabic poetry, namely, the ''[[Muwashshah|muwashshaḥ]]'' (lit. "girdle poem,"&lt;ref&gt;''Hebrew Verse'', ed. T. Carmi, New York, N.Y. 1981, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; being the most common poetic form in Yemen)&lt;ref&gt;Mishael Maswari Caspi, ''Sa'adya ben Abrahan al-Bashiri: A Seventeenth Century Northern Yemenite Poet'', [[Hebrew Union College Annual]], Vol. 51 (1980), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Andalusian ''[[zajal]]''.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes&gt;Yosef Tobi (Professor emeritus, the Department of Hebrew and Comparative Literature at the University of Haifa), lecture notes.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Muwashshah|muwashshaḥ]]'', the first [[strophe]] of the poem sets up a specific rhyme, and each strophe that follows is composed of four verses, whose last rhymes with the original strophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caspi |first=Mishael |title= Saʿadya ben Abrahan al-Bashīrī: A Seventeenth Century Northern Yemenite Poet |journal= Hebrew Union College Annual|volume= 51|issue= |pages= 178 |jstor= 23507685|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; These poetic genres were strictly composed in Hebrew, or else with a mixture of the two languages (Hebrew and [[Judeo-Arabic]]), although, occasionally, it could be found solely in Judeo-Arabic. The vast majority of these compositions are contained in an anthology known as the [[Diwan (poetry)|Dīwān]].
[[File:Yemenite Diwan.jpg|thumb|Anthology of para-liturgical poems ("Diwan")]]

===The ''Nashīd''===
The ''nashīd'' is a song that, from the beginning to end, uses only one [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] and one rhyme. It is sung by one or, at most, two members of a group, who are answered by the rest in attendance. The ''nashīd'' is a serious, often sad chant.&lt;ref name="Frankfurt/Main1987"&gt;''The Jews of Yemen'', ''Yemen - 3000 Years of Art and Civilisation in Arabia Felix'', (ed. Werner Daum), Frankfurt/Main, Germany, 1987, p. 279 {{ISBN|3701622922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its content is religious rather than secular, the tone slow and monotonous, while the language employed is generally Hebrew.&lt;ref name="Frankfurt/Main1987" /&gt;

===The ''Shirah''===
The ''shirot'' constitute the chief and essential component of the singing performance. If the atmosphere is agreeable, several ''shirot'' (plural of ''shirah'', or poems) are performed one after the other. "When the atmosphere becomes charged the singer switches the melody or changes the rhythm. The more switches there are the more successful the event and the more esteemed the singer."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzpuQjU0F6Q&amp;t=389 Spielberg Jewish Film Archive - Teiman: The Music of the Yemenite Jews: 6:29]–6:39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''dīwān'', the structural layout of the ''shirah'' (poem), such as those performed at wedding celebrations, is the double ''muwaššaḥ'', a structure that is characteristic of Muslim and Jewish poetry of Yemen, alike. The sense here is that the ''qufl'', or ''simṭ'', which concludes the strophe, is made-up of two parts: (a) three or four short lines, embodying a single rhyme which changes from strophe to lines; (b) two long lines whose rhyme is identical in all the strophes.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt; In Yemenite Jewish tradition, these short lines are called ''tawšīḥ''.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt; The performance of the ''shirah'' (poem) at wedding celebrations by the professional ''meshorer'' (lead singer) opens with a melodious tune, slow and full of yearning, of the ''ghuṣn'' line in the first strophe.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt;

===The ''Hallel''===
The ''halleloth'' (plural for ''Hallel'') are short songs of blessing that begin and conclude with the word ''Hallelujah''. As far as musical intonation and performance is concerned, the ''hallel'' (praise) is considered the simplest of the three genres. One man of the party opens with the starting words of the ''hallel'', while the entire party eagerly joins in with him, in an audible voice and with a monotonous staccato melody, and by prolonging the end of the textual and musical frames.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt;

==Content==
Yemenite poetry is often steeped in allegorical expressions drawn from the [[Kabbalah]] and esoteric writings.&lt;ref name=cincinnati1930&gt;''Diwan of Hebrew and Arabic Poetry of the Yemenite Jews'', [[Abraham Zevi Idelsohn|A.Z. Idelsohn]] (ed. H. Torczyner), Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press 1930, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39514&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=6&amp;hilite p. 6],  (Hebrew); reprinted in Tel-Aviv 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Although it might incorporate themes of wine and of love, or that of a bridegroom and bride, it is, nonetheless, distinctly set apart from songs of [[hedonism]] sung in revelry and in drinking bouts. In Yemenite poetry, such themes serve a mystical meaning, not to be understood in its literal context of a marriage between a man and a woman in the flesh, but of the bridegroom being the Holy One, blessed be He, and his bride, the people of Israel (''Knesset Yisroel'').&lt;ref name=cincinnati1930 /&gt; The poem's principal content is the bride's supplication, meaning, Israel who was banished in exile from the groom's inheritance, from the holy city of Jerusalem, and also the incensed groom's (God's) ethical words of reproof and his longing for his bride.&lt;ref name=cincinnati1930 /&gt; The arch-poet, [[Shalom Shabazi]], many of whose poems make-up a large segment of the ''dīwān'', has written a warning not to think of his poetry in sensual or secular terms, since all had been written as an allegory.&lt;ref&gt;In Shalom Shabazi's own words: "Let no man think that they are, may God forbid, words of lust of a profane [make-up], but rather, [they have been written] after the similitude of a proverb or riddle, like the [[Song of Songs]] [of Solomon], and all of them have been built upon an esoteric approach, but he who would think they are [merely] profane words, may God forbid, concerning him it has been said: Let that man be cursed who makes an idol image and mask." (Original Hebrew: אזהרה לכל מי שישיר לבל יחשוב שהם חס וחלילה דברי חשק של חול כי אם דרך משל וחידה כעין שיר השירים וכולם בנויים ע"ד הסוד והחושב דברי חול ח"ו נאמר עליו ארור האיש אשר יעשה פסל ומסכה).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''nashīd'' (plural: ''nashwad'') is quintessentially religious, usually an appeal to God. The ''shirah'' (poem) is the principal genre sung on different joyous occasions, especially weddings. It is a long song which incorporates different themes–primarily philosophy, praise, and supplication&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yosef Qafih, אכילת 'ג'עלה' מה היא (Hebrew), in ''Legacy of the Jews of Yemen: Studies and Researches'' (Hebrew: מורשת יהודי תימן: עיונים ומחקרים; ed. Yosef Tobi), Jerusalem, 1976 (reprinted in volume 2 of Rabbi Yosef Qafih's ''Collected Papers''): "כאשר אנו בוחנים את שירת יהודי תימן במסיבות השונות ובבתי משתאות נמצאם כולם שירי מחשבה תהילה ותפילה" (p. 58 [p. 914 in ''Collected Papers''])... "שירים רבים תוארה בהם שמחת חתן וכלה, אך אלה נאמרו כבדרך אגב, והעיקר בשיר הוא מחשבה אגדה תהילה ותפילה." (p. 59 [p. 915 in ''Collected Papers'']). Qafih further writes that the corpus of Yemenite poems is in accordance with [[Chazal|Ḥazal]]'s words in Sanhedrin 101a, entirely ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'', ''[[Mishnah|mishnaic]]'', and ''[[Aggadah|haggadic]]'' (ibid., p. 63/919 [Hebrew: "וכאשר נביט לשירת יהודי תימן נמצא כל כולה בהתאם לדברי חז"ל בסנהדרין דף קא, א הנ"ל, כולה הלכה משנה והגדה."]).&lt;/ref&gt;–and has a fixed opening structure in which God is praised, and an ending in which the party of men gathered on that joyous occasion are praised. Actually, on such occasions several ''shirot'' (songs) are sung one after the other.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt;

==Manner of performance==
In Yemen (as also in Israel), the all-male social-gathering always takes place around set tables, on which a variety of dainties have been laid up, with beverages (never actually solid foodstuffs), and traditionally opens with a ''nashīd''. The first to perform this is the most distinguished of the guests at the social-gathering, usually the rabbi, even if he were not a man with a pleasant voice, neither an expert in terms of musical performance, seeing that the music of the ''nashīd'' is simple, similar to the music of liturgical poems (''[[piyyutim]]'') recited in the synagogues, expressing longing and emotion. After he commences with the ''nashīd'', the performance passes unto a more experienced man in the congregation, known for his musical talents and who is called by the Hebrew word, ''meshorer'' (singer of poetry).

The ''meshorer'' (singer) sings the first [[hemistich]] of the stanza, while another person, or the entire congregation, answers after him in concert. Often, one part of the song is sung by the lead singer, while another part is answered in company.&lt;ref&gt;Something reflected in the [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Sotah'' 48a ("אמר רב יוסף זמרי גברי ועני נשי פריצותא זמרי נשי ועני גברי כאש בנעורת").&lt;/ref&gt; In almost every song, repetition of the line in a verse is used, something also alluded to in the Babylonian Talmud (''Berakhoth'' 31a).&lt;ref&gt;In the Talmud, the rabbis asked of R. Hamnona, the younger, to sing at the wedding of a certain rabbi (who was the son of Rabina), he opened by singing: "Woe unto us that we die. Woe unto us that we die." Thus, he doubled the verse of his dirge, just as the ancient custom among Yemenite Jews is to double, or to repeat twice, each verse of the song.&lt;/ref&gt; The professional ''meshorer'' (singer) improvises the performance by changing the melody, but maintains the leisurely pace of the music.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt; In the course of the performance, the ''meshorerim'' (“singers”) can be changed, and, occasionally, even by those who are not professional performers. The performance at the end of the song returns to the one who commenced it.

In the course of performing the ''nashīd'' or the ''shirah'', absolute silence reigns, insofar that these songs are considered sacred songs. Only at the conclusion of the ''nashīd'' or ''shirah'' is it permissible for those lounging to partake of the dainties and beverages, and to bless aloud each man his neighbor.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt;

===Weddings===
Wedding festivities are conducted in the presence of a large group of people and which require a higher level of singing performance. The opening is similar to that of Sabbath and [[Jewish holidays|holiday]] meals, but they soon move to the more essential part of the ''shirot'', as noted, performed by the professional ''meshorer'' (singer), accompanied by a rhythmic beating of a copper plate (''ṣaḥn'') and by dancing performed by well-mannered dancers. The melodies of the Sabbath and holiday meals are very similar&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt; to those related to prayers and liturgical poems and which are said in the synagogue, and belong to the ancient musical heritage of the Jewish people. According to some scholars who found in them a resemblance to the liturgical music of orthodox Christian churches in the Land of Israel, their origin belongs rather to the music of the Temple.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt; In contrast, the melodies of the ''shirot'' (poems) in wedding celebrations and in the dances that accompany them are borrowed, without doubt, from the Muslim surrounding.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt; The impact of Islamic poetry in Yemen over Jewish singing was already felt by Rabbi Yiḥya Qoraḥ, one of the more important Jewish sages in [[Sana'a|Ṣanʻā’]] during the 19th century (1840–1881), who did not hesitate to go to singing parties of the Muslims in his city in order to thoroughly acquaint himself with the poetic requirement of the singing and its performance.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt;

In Yemenite Jewish tradition, the melodies of ''shirot'' sung at wedding celebrations are ascribed unto Rabbi [[Shalom Shabazi]], the most renowned poet of Yemenite Jewry who lived in the 17th century (ca. 1610–1680). However, it seems that this tradition merely reflects the fact that he was the poet who was most instrumental in planting the style of the school of Muslim ''Ḥumaynī'' poetry in Yemenite-Jewish poetry, although he was not the first Jewish poet who wrote in the ''Ḥumaynī'' style.&lt;ref&gt;The formation of the unique poetic school of Yemen, known as the ''ḥumaynī'', left an indelible mark upon the Jewish poet, Shalom Shabazi. On the ''ḥumayni'' school of poetry in Yemen, see Dafari 1966; Bardūnī 1978; Ḥibšī 1986; ‘Amrī 2001, part III: ''min al-adab al-yamanī'' (''al-naṯr wa-al-ḥumaynī''); Wagner 2009; Dufour 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be assumed that he not only took from ''Ḥumaynī'' poetry the parameters related to the folk register of the Arabic language and to the lenient approach in relation to metre and to its bold use of erotic imagery to describe the love of God, but also took the melodies by which Muslims had performed their singing. There is evidence that Jews occasionally sang erotic poems of Muslims–known as ''ash‘ār''–a matter that provoked in its wake harsh criticism from the religious leadership of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name=TobiNotes/&gt; It seems that, similar to the phenomenon that is well-known in other Jewish communities, Shabazi–and presumably also other Jewish poets in Yemen–wrote poems of a religious and national Jewish content, while making use of these Muslim melodies. Dr. Yosef Tobi possesses a video dating back to the 1980s in which a young Muslim from Yemen is performing an Arabic song in the same melodious tune, and with full of yearning, as is found in the poem, ''Qiryah yafefiyah'' (O Beautiful City), an emotional song of yearning for Jerusalem by Rabbi [[Zechariah Dhahiri|Zechariah al-Ḍāhirī]] who lived in the 16th century.

==History==
Yemenite Jewish poetry, as it has been known from the twelfth century unto the mid-fifteenth century, was primarily sacred poetry composed in either Hebrew or Aramaic, that is to say, liturgical poetry intended for prayer in the synagogue, or else para-liturgical poetry intended for social occasions resulting from the yearly events or a person’s life cycle. Such poetry was composed under the influence of liturgical poetry, both Hebrew and Aramaic, in [[Babylonia]], but even more so under the influence of Hebrew liturgical poetry in [[Spain]] (i.e. the early Spanish poets of the Golden Age, [[Moses ibn Ezra]] [b. circa 1060], [[Judah al-Harizi|Alḥarizi]] [1170–1235], Rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] [c. 1089–1167], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] [c. 1020–1058], [[Judah Halevi]] [died 1150], among others). Even secular poetry was written in Yemen to a limited extent, mostly [[panegyric]]s, impacted by secular Hebrew poetry in Spain. Although the source for some of the linguistic values, prosody, and content of Yemenite Jewish poetry for that period was taken from Arabic poetry, this wasn’t the result of any direct contact between Jewish poets and Arab poetry, but rather came about through Hebrew poetry in Spain, whose composers were well-acquainted with Arabic poetry and influenced by it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''The Satirical Qaṣīd about “The Poor Rooster who Died before It Could Be Purified”: The Yemeni Ḥumaynī Poetry and Shalom Shabazīʼs Judeo-Arabic Poetry (17th Century)'', Jerusalem 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, Yemenite Jewish poetry, although influenced by Spanish poetry, still maintained a puristic linguistic approach, meaning, they made use of the most eloquent level of the Hebrew language, which is the level of [[biblical Hebrew]].

There is to be noted in [[Zechariah Dhahiri|Zechariah al-Ḍāhirī]]'s (''circa'' 1531 – d. 1608)&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ḍāhirī is best known for his work entitled, ''Sefer Ha-Mūsar'', in which he brings down some of the finest examples of Hebrew literary genius ever written in Yemen, and where he widely makes use of the poetic genre known as [[maqāma]].&lt;/ref&gt; poetic style a marked transition from the early [[Jewish poetry from Al-Andalus|Spanish-type of poetry]] typical of Yemen prior to his time (depicted in the prosaic writings of Daniel berav Fayyūmī and Avraham b. Ḥalfon, both, of Yemenite Jewish provenance) and the later classical Yemenite poetic writings (as depicted in the [[Piyyut|liturgical poems]] composed by Yosef ben Israel and [[Shalom Shabazi]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13537121.2014.889893 ''Politics and poetry in the works of Shalom Shabazī''], Journal: Israel Affairs, Publisher: Routledge 2014, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the latter who compiled works, both, in Hebrew and in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]], al-Ḍāhirī's corpus of prosaic writings are written almost exclusively in Hebrew. Much of al-Ḍāhirī's poetry was inspired by the great Spanish poets, while other works are said to have been inspired by [[Immanuel the Roman|Immanuel of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Zachariā Al-Ḏāhrī, ''Sefer Hammusar'' (ed. Yehuda Ratzaby), Preface, Ben-Zvi Institute, Jerusalem 1965, p. 16 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of al-Ḍāhirī's poems are panegyrics influenced by the Arabic ''madiḥ'', in praise of great Jewish scholars, such as [[Rabbeinu Yerucham]] (1290-1350),&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Al-Dhahiri, ''Sefer Ha-Mūsar'' (ed. Mordechai Yitzhari), Chapter Twenty-one, Benei Barak 2008 (Hebrew), pp. 135-136.&lt;/ref&gt; a Provençal rabbi who moved to Spain in 1306, following the expulsion of the Jews from France. Other panegyrics were written about Rabbi [[Obadiah di Bertinoro]] (c. 1445-1515) and [[Maimonides]].&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Al-Dhahiri, ''Sefer Ha-Mūsar'' (ed. Mordechai Yitzhari), Chapter Eighteen, Benei Barak 2008 (Hebrew), pp. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various sources indicate that, beginning with the 12th century and continuing till the 15th century, Jews in Yemen were familiar with Arabic philosophical literature, mainly that of the Ismāʻīlīs, including Arabic poetry from their school of philosophers (Havazelet 1992). The first Arabic poems compiled by Yemenite Jews were not lyrical or emotional poems–whether personal expressions of emotion or those related to the entire nation–but rather a combination of poetic prosody and philosophical ideas. Meaning, their main purpose was to pass on to the community a philosophical, ethic-like religious message, even though they didn’t have any role in the religious practice related to Yemenite Jews, whether in the synagogue or in the para-liturgical religious frameworks.

It was only at the end of the 16th century that the Arab contribution in Jewish poetry in Yemen began to surge. The start of this process was in the poetry of Yosef ben Israel (late 16th century – early 17th century). This process, however, reached its climax in the poetry of [[Shalom Shabazi]] (1619–1680+), nearly the half of which is written in Arabic (with Hebrew characters). This process, however, involved two other phenomena that are interrelated: (a) the subject matter of the poems written in Arabic was very diverse and incorporated in them virtually all the genres known to poetry, especially poems containing an epic nature; (b) the [[linguistic register]] which serves in a particular part of the poetry written by Shabazī distances itself from the classical [[Judeo-Arabic]] spoken in the Middle-Ages, and becomes more like a colloquial language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

These two phenomena characterize in a small measure the poetic work of Yosef ben Israel, who frequently wrote about philosophical issues, and, consequently, preserved the “purity” of the classical Arabic language and wasn’t drawn after the colloquial tongue. Furthermore, in those liturgical poems whose nature is obviously epic, and apparently closer to folk literature, such as the poem entitled ''Asabbiḥ ilāh al-kull wa-aʻla bi-ṭāʻatoh'' (or: ''bi-ḥikmatoh''), which brings down the story of Joseph and his brothers, the poet has preserved a high “classical” register of Judeo-Arabic and has distanced himself from the colloquial (Ḥafeṣ Ḥayyim, 1966, p.&amp;nbsp;215–219).

Under the influence of the Yemeni-Muslim ''ḥumaynī'' poetry, Yosef ben Israel and Shabazī often wrote [[Muwashahat|muwaššaḥāt]] of double structure, were lenient regarding the rigid rules of [[Metre (poetry)#The Arabic metres|Arabic metre]], and were not even deterred from using extreme erotic expressions in describing an allegorical lover – whether it happened to be the Messiah or God. This, some say, was also the result of their being influenced by the midrashic commentary on the [[Song of Songs]] and [[kabbalistic]] literature (Farrāj-Fallāh 2011). Such verse, however, never degenerated into the sensuous ''hazl'' genre. That is certainly the case with regard to the more “classical” genres – ''nashīd'', ''shīrah'', and ''hallel'' – which were in fact an integral part of the national-religious nature of the Yemenite Jewish community, an experience which wasn’t very different from any other Jewish community in the Diaspora.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Jews of Yemen have traditionally viewed Arab poetry with the selective approach of “rapprochement and rejection.” Secular hedonistic poetry was mostly rejected by them, while adopting elements of praise as found in panegyrics and in other genres of Arab poetry.

===The ''qaṣīd'' (poetic tale)===
The ''qaṣīd'' (poetic tale; plural: ''qiṣwad''),&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes pronounced ''qaṣīṭ''/''qiṣwaṭ'' owing to the impact of the emphatic ''ṣād'', or ''qiṣṣa'' (''quṣṣa'').&lt;/ref&gt; as used in Yemenite Jewish works, was written mostly in Judeo-Arabic. It is nearly always the fruit of a single poet, and while bearing precise rules of meter and rhyme, it is still artificial and cumbersome, only a few being able to learn it by heart, and remember it only for short periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Nissim Binyamin Gamlieli, "Yemenite-Jewish Folksong and Poetry", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 375 {{OCLC|1041776317}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is largely distinguished from the earlier canonical genres by its content, and as a result of which, also its designation. The use of the ''qaṣīd'' genre in Yemenite Jewish poetry was unknown prior to Yosef ben Israel and Shalom Shabazī. At large, the general category of the ''qiṣwad'' may be divided into four subgenres:

: (a) Poems written about national or personal tragedies, such as the [[Mawza Exile|expulsion of the Jews of Yemen to Mawza]] in 1679 (Halevi 1999–2003, pp. 331–333); the severe famine and the deadly events in the year of 1836 (Tobi 1999). 
: (b) Debate poems between two interlocutors, whether they be people, objects, cities or concepts; for example, the debate between the [[Coffea arabica|coffee]] and the [[Catha edulis|qāt]],&lt;ref&gt;Which, among other secular poems, the Yemenite Jews refrained from singing (Rabbi Yosef Qafih, אכילת 'ג'עלה' מה היא [Hebrew], in ''Legacy of the Jews of Yemen: Studies and Researches'' [Hebrew: מורשת יהודי תימן: עיונים ומחקרים; ed. Yosef Tobi], Jerusalem, 1976, pp. 62–63 [pp. 918–919 in volume 2 of Rabbi Yosef Qafih's ''Collected Papers'']: "ומשום זה נמנעו בתימן לשיר שירי חול, כגון 'אלקאת ואלקהוה', 'אלעזב ואלמזוג' ', 'קאלת תעז אלעדינה', וכיוצא.").&lt;/ref&gt; between the bachelor and the married man (Bacher 1909; Halevi 1999-2003, I, pp. 257–260), or between the capital city of Ṣanʻā’ and other cities in Yemen (Bacher 1909; Ben Ami 2013).
: (c) Satirical poems by which the poet gives vent to the injustice committed unto him by some person or by some community, such as the poem about the stolen porcelain bottle of wine,&lt;ref&gt;''Ḥafeṣ Ḥayyim'' 1966, pp. 105–106: ''Abdā bi-rabbī ḏī xalaq ‘īdān muksī bi-al-waraq''.&lt;/ref&gt; or the story about the stolen robe.&lt;ref&gt;Known in Judeo-Arabic as ''Qiṣṣat al-Malḥafah'' (the Story of the Robe), written by the Jewish poet, Yefet (Ḥasan) b. Abraham al-Taʻizzī, who hailed from Ta‘izz.&lt;/ref&gt;
: (d) Humorous poems about certain events of non-importance, such as the perfume sprinkler (''marašš'') which was broken,&lt;ref&gt;''Ḥafeṣ Ḥayyim'' 1966, pp. 106–107: ''Abdā bi-wāḥid fī al-samā fāhim li-mufṣiḥ wa-a‘jamā''.&lt;/ref&gt; or the poem about the rooster that was slaughtered and eaten, although not by its owner, and without his knowledge.

All these four subgenres of the ''qaṣīd'' are characterized by actual events and relevance; in other words, relating to the events of everyday life, and to the reality of life that could be felt in Yemen. As such, the language employed adapts itself to this character, and is written in the spoken (colloquial) Yemenite dialect. However, due to this debased and low characteristic, the ''qaṣīd'' was completely detached from the national-religious experience, and was never performed in the aforementioned social gatherings, except toward the end, after the distinguished guests, including rabbis, had abandoned the party. This is absolutely non-existent with respect to the “classical” genres of ''nashīd'', ''shīrah'' and ''hallel'' that were performed with vocal music in para-liturgical social gatherings. It is worthy of noting that copyists were usually not willing to include the ''qiṣwad'' in their ''dīwāns''.

===''Maaneh'' poetry (Responsive poetry)===
This is a special literary genre that also found its way into Yemen, used in men's company, but almost exclusively in women's company during their social gatherings. The ''maaneh'' poem (responsive poem) is a term that defines the fact that the poem was composed by combining some of the verses borrowed from an older poem (usually by a different author), including in most cases the poem's meter, rhyme and tempo, and which lyrics were later improvised with new stanzas interspersed between the old.&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 73–74 in: {{cite journal |last=Caspi |first=Mishael M. |title=The Jawab Poetry (Shire Ma'ane) in Jewish Yemenite Poetry |journal=Hebrew Abstracts |volume=15 |issue= the David Rudavsky Issue|pages=72–76 |jstor=27908092 |date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is of singular importance to note that the corpus of ''maaneh'' poetry were usually drawn from older poems having the structure of a ''nashid'', but none were drawn from older girdle poems. One of the most famous 'responsive poems' written in Yemen was ''Ḥus Elohai mime‘onkha'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''חוס אלהי ממעונך'''}}), by the Yemenite poet Hisdai, and which he wrote based on the poem, ''Ya‘avor ‘Alai Reṣonakh'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''יעבור עלי רצונך'''}}), by [[Judah Halevi]]. It is highly probable that old melodies were preserved in this way, and which were once common to distant Jewish communities.

:''Take pity, my God, from your dwelling place''
:''Upon the lily of your valley, Sharon'' 
:''May your favor come over me''
:''When your wrath has gone away!''

:''Deliver me from my wanton sins''
:''For my heart and eye are turned unto you''
:''Will mine iniquities forever''
:''Stand between me and you?''&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from ''Ḥus Elohai mime‘onkha'' by Hisdai&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selections==

The following ''nashid'' was composed by the arch-poet, [[Shalom Shabazi]], and bears the author's [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]] (cognomen) in acrostics; the first letter of each strophe spelling out the name, Abu Shimon Al-Shabazi. The rhyme, needless to say, has been lost in the translation, but can be seen in its original.

Such an accomplishment brings with it a quickening of heart, and gives you a real cause for rejoicing within the soul; A sound mind and the elevation of one's inner self will, on its account, be indelibly bound together for good.

A good name will then be reputed unto you, and you shall also obtain your desire. Search, therefore, in the treatises compiled by the ''geonim'';
[In] the oral recital of the Sages, which they received from their forefathers, on that very day when they did go about Sinai, and their minds were perfectly enlightened;
The father of all prophets went up on high, even into the dark cloud, whence he did hasten his footsteps;
And whence a host of heavenly angels did favourably escort him. Whereupon he went up, and opened all the gates that were closed.
Before the face of Sinai, my tribes were gathered together; also the heavenly angels passed over the banners.

Fire came down, from the [[Divine Presence]] it went around; thunder and lightning, and a cloud were conjoined.
The tablets are two; they have been written in equity. In them are [[Ten Commandments]]; for a testimony they have become the subject of [our] inquiry.
They heard, 'I am [the Lord your God],' and 'You shall not have [any other god before Me]'; from the mouth of the Omnipotent they [issued forth], while they have kept the Torah.   
Blessed is He who has merited his congregation to see futurities; whom by the perfect Law has made souls worthy.
Remember, O Lord of all things, the beauty of your Torah; Gather in those of us who are scattered, who have been dispersed.
Make straight our path, for the sake of your loving-kindness; For on account of those who fear you, acts of kindness have prevailed.

In the first two stanzas of the following ''nashid'', Rabbi Shalom Shabazi makes known his longing for the Divine Presence in the land of Israel:

&lt;poem&gt;
The love of Hadassah (i.e. the Divine Presence&lt;ref&gt;So explained by Rabbi Amram Qorah, in his commentary, ''Alamoth Shir'', on the Diwan, although T. Carmi, in his ''Hebrew Verse'', explains its meaning as "the Land of Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;) is bound upon my heart,
But I am in the midst of exile; my feet sinking in the depths below.
Had I been given leave, I'd go up and join myself [unto her],
Even in the very midst of the gates of [[Zion]] which are famous!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2725">'''Zagmuk''', which literally means "beginning of the year", is a [[Mesopotamia]]n festival celebrating the [[New Year]]. The feast fell in December&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Andrew. ''Magic and Religion'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted about 12 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Zakmuk&amp;offset=0 "Zakmuk,"] Probert Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; It celebrates the triumph of [[Marduk]], the patron deity of [[Babylon]], over the forces of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], symbolized in later times by [[Tiamat]]. The battle between Marduk and Chaos lasts 12 days, as does the festival of Zagmuk.  In Uruk the festival was associated with the god [[Anu|An]], the Sumerian god of the night sky. Both are essentially equivalent in all respects to the Akkadian "[[Akitu]]" festival. In some variations, Marduk is slain by Tiamat on the winter solstice and [[resurrection|resurrected]] on the [[vernal equinox]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pxqw7XnGQuoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;ots=uPSrKl6FHa&amp;dq=Zagmuk&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=HbGX6OWOZOxFQpDVDnKdmZYcILU Yule: A Celebration of Light and Warmth By Dorothy Morrison]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Babylon, the battle was acted out at the royal court with the king playing Marduk, and his son-rescuer as Nabu, the god of writing. Once freed from the powers of the underworld, the king would enact the rite of the [[Sacred Marriage]] on the 10th day of the ceremony. During this rite, the king (or En, as he was known in Sumer) would perform sexual intercourse with his spouse, normally a high priestess who had been chosen from among the ''naditum'', a special class of priestesses who had taken a vow not of celibacy precisely, but of a refusal to bear children. The high priestess was known as the ''entu'', and her ritual act of intercourse with the king was thought to regenerate the cosmos through a reenactment of the primordial coupling of the cosmic parents An and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]], who had brought the world into being at the dawn of Time. If an eclipse of the sun fell on any of the 12 days of the ceremony, a substitute for the king was put in his place, since it was thought that any evils which might have befallen the king would accrue to the substitute instead. On the last day of the festival, the king was slain so that he could battle at Marduk's side. To spare their king, Mesopotamians often utilized a mock king, played by a criminal who was anointed as king before the start of Zagmuk, and killed on the last day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9971">{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Zandik''' (Middle Persian: 𐭦𐭭𐭣𐭩𐭪) is a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] term conventionally interpreted as [[heretic]] in a narrow sense, or, in a wider sense, for a person with any belief or practice that ran contrary to [[Sassanid empire|Sassanid]]-mediated Zoroastrian [[orthodoxy]]. 

The [[Middle Persian]] term engendered the better-attested Arabic زنديق ''[[zindiq]]'', with the same semantic field but related to Islam rather than Zoroastrianism. In the Islamic world, including Islamic-era Iran, the term was also variously assigned to [[Manichaean]]s, [[Mandaean]]s, [[Mazdakite]]s, Zoroastrians, Buddhists, Christians, and free-thinkers in general, including Muslims.&lt;ref name="Schaeder"&gt;{{citation|last=Schaeder|first=Hans Heinrich|chapter=Zandik-Zindiq|title=Iranische Beiträge, I|series=Schriften der Königsberger Gelehrten Gesellschaft 6, K5|location=Halle|publisher=KGG|year=1930|pages=274-291}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|276}} Whether ''zandik'' was also used in any of these ways in Zoroastrian times is unknown; in that context, the term is only attested in three texts (two from the same author), and in all three appears as a [[hapax legomenon]] used in a pejorative way, but with no additional hints from which to infer a meaning. 

In several now-obsolete studies related to Zoroastrianism, the word was also speculated to be the proper name of a particular (but hypothetical) priestly tradition that embraced [[Zurvanite]] doctrine.&lt;!-- The now-obsolete 'Swedish school' of Iranian Studies considered 'zandik' to be a Parthian word. --&gt;

==Lexicology==
The conventional translation as 'heretic' was already common in the 19th century when Christian Bartholomae (1885),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bartholomae|first=Christian|title=Altiranisches Wörterbuch|year=1855|location=Strassburg|publisher=Trübner|at=col. 1662}}.&lt;/ref&gt; derived ''zandik'' from [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''zanda'', which he treated as a name of certain heretics.&lt;ref name="Schaeder" /&gt;{{rp|276}}

Early examples of Arabic ''zindiq'' primarily denote Manichaeans, and this is possibly also the meaning of the term in the early attested use in Middle Persian (see [[#waldo|below]]). This early usage led A. A. Bevan&lt;sup&gt;[[wikt:apud|''apud'']] &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaeder" /&gt;{{rp|274}} to derive Middle Persian ''zandik'' from Syriac ''zaddiq'' 'righteous' as a Manichaean technical term for 'listeners' (i.e. lay persons, as contradistinguished from the Manichaean elite). Bevan's derivation was widely accepted until the 1930s, especially amongst scholars of Semitic languages, but was discredited following a comprehensive review of both Arabic and Iranian usage by H. H. Schaeder (1930). Schaeder pointed out that the substantive was ''zand'', not ''zandik'' (an etymology would thus have to explain ''zand'', not ''zandik''), as ''-ik'' was merely a regular [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] adjectivizing suffix.&lt;ref name="Schaeder"&gt;{{citation|last=Schaeder|first=Hans Heinrich|chapter=Zandik-Zindiq|title=Iranische Beiträge, I|series=Schriften der Königsberger Gelehrten Gesellschaft 6, K5|location=Halle|publisher=KGG|year=1930|pages=274-291}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|277}} 

An alternative interpretation that explains both 'Manichaean' and 'heretic' derives the substantive in ''zandik'' from [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''𐬰𐬀𐬥'' ''zan'' 'to know, to explain',&lt;ref name="Schaeder" /&gt;{{rp|276-277}} which is also the origin of Middle Persian '[[zend|zand]]' (a class of exegetical commentaries) and '[[Pazand]]' (a writing system). In this explanation, the term ''zandik'' came to be applied to anyone who gave greater weight to human interpretation than to scripture (perceived to be divinely transmitted). Prior to Schaeder's review, the term was commonly assumed to first explain 'Manichaean', and to then have developed a meaning of 'heretic' as a secondary development.&lt;ref name="Schaeder" /&gt;{{rp|277}} In that model, the term referred to Manichaeans because of their disposition to interpret and explain the scriptures of other religions in accordance with their own ideas.

==In inscriptions==
Under the Sassanids (224-651 CE), the previously informal indigenous Iranian religious tradition now known as 'Zoroastrianism' was mediated and formalized into the systemized configuration with which it survives today.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=On the Orthodoxy of Sasanian Zoroastrianism|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=59|issue=1|year=1996|pages=11–28|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00028536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Denkard]]'', a 9th-11th century work of Zoroastrian tradition, attributes this systemization of doctrine -- in which certain beliefs and traditions were seen as definite while others were considered unacceptable -- to an initiative by Tansar, high priest under [[Ardashir I]], the founder of the dynasty. The development of a particular orthodoxy is also indicated by other sources, such as the ''[[Letter of Tansar]]'', which additionally suggests that the systemization of the Zoroastrian church was part of a greater state-sponsored "revival" of Iranian values, apparently as a Sassanian reaction to the perceived cultural "corruptions" of the preceding (likewise Iranian, but Hellenistic) [[Arsacid empire|Arsacid Parthian]] dynasts.&lt;ref name="LoT"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary, ed.|last2=Minovi|first2=Mojtaba, trans.|year=1968|title=The Letter of Tansar|location=Rome|publisher=Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arsacids were probably not as culturally "[[Aniran|un-Iranian]]" as Tansar's/Ardashir's propagandistic justification to overthrow them indicates,&lt;ref name="LoT" /&gt; and it isn't even clear whether the systemization had any effect on the general populace in Sassanid times itself (or whether this first occurred in the post-Sassanian period).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Shaked|first=Shaul|year=1994|title=Dualism in transformation: varieties of religion in Sasanian Iran|series=Jordan Lectures on Comparative Religion, vol. XVI|location=London|publisher=SOAS}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, literary and epigraphic evidence from the third century onwards indicates that Sassanid-era priests in positions of authority persecuted individuals who held beliefs that were in not in accord with their (Sassanid-mediated) brand of Zoroastrianism. Among this epigraphic evidence are the 3rd/4th-century inscriptions of [[Kartir]], Tansar's successor and high priest under three of Ardashir I's successors. In his own inscription on the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], Kartir states (''KKZ'' 8-9) that he persecuted &lt;!-- Caution: LITERAL QUOTATION, do not change substantially, the inscription is subject to interpretation --&gt;"Jews, Buddhists, Brahmins, [[Nasorean]]s (Judeo-Christians), Christians, 'Maktaks' (Mandaeans, Manichaeans?) and ''zandiks''."&lt;ref name="JDG"&gt;{{citation|last=Duchesne-Guillemin|first=Jacques|chapter=Zoroastrian religion in the Sasanian period|title=Cambridge History of Iran, vol. 3(2)|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=866-908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kartir's inscription is the earliest epigraphic evidence of the word ''zandik''. 

Although the precise meaning of ''zandik'' is not evident from Kartir's use of the term, it is commonly assumed to mean 'heretic', or 'unorthodox' in relation to Kartir's ideology.&lt;sup&gt;cf. &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="JDG" /&gt; However, none of Kartir's inscriptions actually define the contents of his orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="JDG" /&gt; From this inscription and another at Sar Mashad, it appears that the only doctrine that Kartir was concerned with was the belief in a hereafter, a heaven and a hell, with one or the other as the final destination of the soul as reward or punishment for deeds in this life.&lt;ref name="JDG" /&gt; Nonetheless, in 1920s-1960s scholarship, Kartir's silence on the subject precipitated an ''[[Argument from silence|ex silencio]]'' view that the 'heresy' in question must have been [[Zurvanism]], a now-extinct branch of Zoroastrianism influenced by Hellenistic and/or Babylonian notions of the hereafter. The word ''zandik'' was even speculated to be the proper name of a particular (unattested) priestly school that embraced Zurvanite doctrine, to which a number of unappealing aspects of Zoroastrian religious praxis were then attributed.&lt;!-- all the ex-silencio stuff is bad science, and actually doesn't deserve mention. However, leaving it out will attract uninformed additions (very likely based on copyright-expired stuff), so I've mentioned it with the following caveat.--&gt; Modern Iranian scholarship is much less inclined to wild speculation, and these hypothetical constructs are no longer followed today.

{{anchor|waldo}}Noticeably absent from Kartir's list is any immediately identifiable mention of Manichaeans, who were intermittently persecuted by the Sassanid establishment, also by Kartir, who is explicitly named as one of Mani's persecutor's in Manichaean sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Henning|first=Walter Bruno|title=Mani's Last Journey|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=X|issue=4|year=1942|pages=948–949|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00090133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three suggested reasons to explain this anomaly: a) The conventional view is that Kartir includes them under the term 'Maktak';&lt;ref name="JDG" /&gt; b) an alternate position is that Kartir's text dates from the early period of Bahram I's rule when Mani still had Shapur I's and Hormizd I's protection; c) the third view is that Manichaeans are included in 'zandik'.&lt;ref name="Schaeder" /&gt;

==In tradition==
The term ''zandik'' appears once in the 9th/10th-century texts of Zoroastrian tradition (the so-called Pahlavi books). In this one instance, in ''[[Menog-i Khrad|Daedestan i Menog-i Khrad]]'' 36.16, the term appears as an abstract noun ('zandikih') and is explained to be the thirteenth most heinous crime.
