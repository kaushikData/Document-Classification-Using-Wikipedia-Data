      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">'''Arthur Hilary Armstrong''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (13 August 1909 &amp;ndash; 16 October 1997) was an [[England|English]] educator and author. Armstrong is recognized as one of the foremost authorities on the philosophical teachings of [[Plotinus]] ca. 205–270 CE. His multi-volume translation of the philosopher's teachings is regarded as an essential tool of classical studies.

== Life ==
Hilary Armstrong was born in [[Hove, England]]. He was the son of W. A. (clergy) and E. Cripps Armstrong. He married Deborah Wilson in 1933. He has two sons and three daughters. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] in 1932 and his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1935. His hobbies and other interests included travel and gardening. He was made a [[fellow]] of the [[British Academy]] in 1970 and a fellow in the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]].

==Academia==
Armstrong began his teaching career in 1936 at [[University of Wales, Swansea|University College, Swansea]], [[Wales]]. His tenure at this university lasted until 1939. He then began teaching at the [[Royal University of Malta]] in [[Valletta]] as a professor of classics. In 1943, he became a classical [[sixth form]] master at [[Beaumont College]], [[Old Windsor]], [[Berkshire]], [[England]]. Three years later, in 1946, he relocated to [[Cardiff University]] with the position of lecturer in [[Latin]]. From 1950-1972 he served as the [[Gladstone Professor of Greek]] at [[University of Liverpool]] in [[Liverpool, England]], being appointed [[professor emeritus]] upon retirement 1972.

From 1970 to 1971, Armstrong was named a [[The Killam Trusts|Killam Senior Fellow]] at [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia (former city)|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. He also achieved a [[visiting professor]]ship of classics and philosophy there beginning in 1972. He was also named a visiting professor at [[Manhattanville College]] in 1966. He was a founding Editor of [[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]], together with [[James Doull|J. A. Doull]] and [[Robert Crouse|R. D. Crouse]].

In 1973, he won the ''Aquinas Medal'' from the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]].

'''Abu'l-Barakāt Hibat Allah ibn Malkā al-Baghdādī''' ({{lang-ar|أبو البركات هبة الله بن ملكا البغدادي}}; c. 1080 – 1164 or 1165 CE) was an [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and [[Medicine in medieval Islam|physician]] of [[Jews|Jewish]] descent from [[Baghdad, Iraq]]. Abu'l-Barakāt, an older contemporary of [[Maimonides]], was originally known by his Hebrew birth name  Baruch ben Malka and was given the name of Nathanel by his pupil [[Isaac ben Ezra]] before his conversion from [[Judaism]] to [[Islam]] towards the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Norman A. Stillman; Shlomo Pines. "Abū ʾl-Barakāt al-Baghdādī." Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings include the anti-Aristotelian philosophical work ''Kitāb al-Muʿtabar'' ("The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection"); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet; and the treatise "On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime". Abu'l-Barakāt was an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosopher who in many respects followed [[Ibn Sina]], but also developed his own ideas.&lt;ref name="Stroumsa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Sarah|title=Self, Soul and Body in Religious Experience|year=1998|publisher=Brill|url=http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~stroums/files/Self_Soul_body.pdf|author2=A. Baumgarten|page=318|chapter=Twelfth Century Concepts of Soul and Body: The Maimonidean Controversy in Baghdad|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.

His thought influenced the [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illuminationist school]] of [[Early Islamic philosophy|classical Islamic philosophy]], the [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)|medieval Jewish philosopher]] [[Ibn Kammuna]],&lt;ref name=Langermann&gt;{{citation|first=Y.

==Life==
Abu'l-Barakāt, famed as ''Awḥad al-Zamān'' (Unique One of his Time), was born in Balad, a town on the [[Tigris]] above [[Mosul]] in modern-day Iraq. As a renowned physician, he served at the courts of the caliphs of Baghdad and the Seljuk sultans.{{sfn|Sirat|1996|p=131}}

He converted to Islam in old age. Abu'l Barakat does not refer to his conversion in his writings, and the historical sources give contradictory episodes of his conversion. According to the various reports, he converted either out of "wounded pride", fear of the personal consequences of the death of Sultan [[Mahmud II of Great Seljuq|Mahmud]]'s wife while under his care as a physician or fear of execution when he was taken prisoner in a battle between the armies of the caliph and that of the sultan. Ayala Eliyahu argues that the conversion was "probably motivated by convenience reasons".&lt;ref name="Kraemer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraemer|first=Joel L.|title=Maimonides: The Life and World of One of Civilization's Greatest Minds|year=2010|publisher=Random House of Canada|isbn=0-385-51200-7|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sirat|1996|p=132}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eliyahu|first=Ayala|title=Taking Turns: New Perspectives on Jews &amp; Conversion|url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/cajs/fellows11/cajs2011.html|publisher=Penn Libraries|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Lewis|title=Jews of Islam|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=1-4008-1023-X|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac, the son of the [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] and the son-in-law of [[Judah Halevi]],&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; was one of his pupils,&lt;ref name="Kraemer" /&gt; to whom Abu'l-Barakāt, Jewish at the time, dictated a long philosophical commentary on [[Ecclesiastes]], written in Arabic using Hebrew aleph bet. Isaac wrote a poem in his honour as introduction to this work.{{sfn|Sirat|1996|p=131}}

==Philosophy==

===Experimental method===
Al-Baghdaadi described an early [[scientific method]] emphasizing repeated [[experiment]]ation, influenced by [[Ibn Sina]], as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Studies in Arabic versions of Greek texts and in mediaeval science|volume=2|first=Shlomo |last=Pines|authorlink=Shlomo Pines|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1986|isbn=965-223-626-8|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Because of the frequency of the experience, these judgements may be regarded as certain, even without our knowing the reason [for the phenomenon]. For there is certain knowledge that the effect in question is not due to chance. It must accordingly be supposed that it is due to nature or to some modality thereof. Thus the cause qua cause, though not its species or mode of operation, is known. For experimental science is also constituted by a knowledge of the cause and by an induction based on all the data of sensation; whereby a general science is reached. ... But in the cases in which an experiment has not been completed, because of its not having been repeated in such a way that the persons, the time and the circumstances varied in everything that did not cause the determining cause, whereas this cause [remained invariable], the experiment does not prove certain knowledge, but only probably opinion."}}

===Motion===
According to [[Alistair Cameron Crombie]], al-Baghdaadi was a follower of the scientific and philosophical teachings of [[Avicennism|Ibn Sina]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of [[Power (physics)|power]] with successive increments of velocity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie|Crombie, Alistair Cameron]], ''Augustine to Galileo 2'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Shlomo Pines]], al-Baghdaadi's theory of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] was thus

&lt;blockquote&gt;the oldest negation of [[Aristotle]]'s fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in a vague fashion of the fundamental law of [[classical mechanics]] [namely, that a force applied continuously produces acceleration].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Al-Baghdaadi's theory of motion distinguished between [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]] and showed that [[force]] is proportional to acceleration rather than velocity.&lt;ref name=Gutman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Studies in Arabic versions of Greek texts and in mediaeval science|volume=2|first=Shlomo |last= Pines|authorlink=Shlomo Pines|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1986|isbn=965-223-626-8|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th-century philosophers [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]] later refer to Abu'l-Barakat in explaining that the acceleration of a falling body is a result of its increasing [[Theory of impetus|impetus]].{{Citation needed |date=April 2017}} Abu'l-Barakat also modified [[Ibn Sina]]'s theory of [[projectile motion]], and stated that the mover imparts a violent inclination (''mayl qasri'') on the moved and that this diminishes as the moving object distances itself from the mover.&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{citation|title=Pseudo-Avicenna, Liber Celi Et Mundi: A Critical Edition|first=Oliver|last=Gutman|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2003|isbn=90-04-13228-7|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Baghdaadi also suggested that motion is relative, writing that "there is motion only if the relative positions of the bodies in question change." He also stated that "each type of body has a characteristic velocity that reaches its maximum when its motion encounters no [[Drag (physics)|resistance]]."&lt;ref name=Langermann/&gt;

===Space and time===
Al-Baghdaadi criticized Aristotle's concept of [[time]] as "the measure of motion" and instead redefines the concept with his own definition of time as "the measure of being", thus distinguishing between [[space]] and time, and reclassifying time as a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] concept rather than a physical one. The scholar Y. [[Tzvi Langermann]] writes:&lt;ref name=Langermann/&gt;

{{quote|Dissatisfied with the regnant approach, which treated time as an accident of the cosmos, al-Baghdadi drew the conclusion that time is an entity whose conception (''ma'qul al-zaman'') is a priori and almost as general as that of being, encompassing the sensible and the non-sensible, that which moves and that which is at rest. Our idea of time results not from abstraction, stripping accidents from perceived objects, but from a mental representation based on an innate idea. Al-Baghdadi stops short of offering a precise definition of time, stating only that 'were it to be said that time is the measure of being (''miqdar al-wujud''), that would be better than saying [as Aristotle does] that it is the measure of motion'. His reclassification of time as a subject for metaphysics rather than for physics represents a major conceptual shift, not a mere formalistic correction. It also breaks the traditional linkage between time and space. Concerning space, al-Baghdadi held unconventional views as well, but he did not remove its investigation from the domain of physics.}}

In his view, there is just one time which is similar for all beings, including God. Abu'l-Barakāt also regarded space as three-dimensional and infinite.&lt;ref name="Marenbon" /&gt;

===Psychology===
He upheld the unity of the soul, denying that there is a distinction between it and the intellect.&lt;ref name="Marenbon" /&gt; For him, the soul's awareness of itself is the definitive proof that the soul is independent of the body and will not perish with it.&lt;ref name=Stroumsa /&gt; On his contributions to [[Islamic psychology]], Langermann writes:&lt;ref name=Langermann/&gt;

{{quote|Al-Baghdadi's most significant departure in psychology concerns human self-awareness. Ibn Sina had raised the issue of our consciousness of our own psychic activities, but he had not fully pursued the implications for Aristotelian psychology of his approach. Al-Baghdadi took the matter much further, dispensing with the traditional psychological faculties and pressing his investigations in the direction of what we would call the unconscious.}}

==Works==
He wrote a critique of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] and [[Aristotelian physics]] entitled ''Kitab al-Mu'tabar'' (the title may be translated as "The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection"). According to Abu'l-Barakāt, Kitāb al-Muʿtabar consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work. The work "presented a serious philosophical alternative to, and criticism of, [[Ibn Sina]]".&lt;ref name="shihadeh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shihadeh|first=Ayman|title=From al-Ghazali to al-Razi: 6th/12th Century Developments in Muslim Philosophical Theology|journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy|date=1 March 2005|volume=15|issue=1|pages=141–179|doi=10.1017/S0957423905000159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also developed concepts which resemble several modern theories in [[physics]].&lt;ref name=Langermann/&gt;

Abu'l-Barakāt also wrote a short treatise on the [[intellect]], ''Kitāb Ṣaḥiḥ adillat al-naql fī māhiyyat al-ʻaql'' (''صحيح أدلة النقل في ماهية العقل''), which has been edited by [[Ahmad El-Tayeb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-Tayyib|first=Aḥmad|title=Un traité d'Abū l-Barakāt al-Baġdādī sur l'intellect|journal=Annales Islamologiques|year=1980|issue=16|pages=127–147|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All that we possess in the way of medical writing by Abu'l-Barakāt are a few prescriptions for remedies. These remain in manuscript and are as yet unstudied.&lt;ref name=Selin&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-4066-3|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Abu'l-Barakāt's thought had a deep influence on Islamic philosophy but none on Jewish thought. His works were not translated into Hebrew,&lt;ref name="Marenbon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marenbon|first=John|title=Medieval philosophy|page=76|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-30875-5|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is seldom cited in Jewish philosophy, probably because of his conversion to Islam.{{sfn|Sirat|1996|p=132}}

The famous theologian and philosopher [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] was one of Abu'l-Barakāt's eminent disciples. The influence of Al-Baghdadi's views appears especially in Al-Razi's chief work ''Al-Mabāḥith al-Mashriqiyyah'' (''Oriental Discourses''). Abu'l-Barakāt influenced certain conceptions of [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frank|first=Daniel H.|title=History of Jewish philosophy|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-08064-9|author2=Leaman, Oliver|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''Chinese ancestor worship''', or '''Chinese ancestor veneration''', also called the '''Chinese patriarchal religion''',{{sfnb|Zhou|2003|p=42}} is an aspect of the [[Chinese traditional religion]] which revolves around the ritual celebration of the [[deification|deified]] ancestors and [[tutelary deities]] of [[Chinese kin|people with the same surname]] organised into [[Chinese lineage associations|lineage societies]] in [[ancestral shrines]]. Ancestors, their ghosts, or spirits, and gods are considered part of "this world", that is, they are neither supernatural (in the sense of being outside nature) nor transcendent in the sense of being beyond nature. The ancestors are humans who have become godly beings, beings who keep their individual identities. For this reason, Chinese religion is founded on veneration of ancestors.{{sfnb|Nadeau|2010|p=369}} Ancestors are believed to be a means of connection to the supreme power of [[Tian]]  as they are considered embodiments or reproducers of the creative order of Heaven.{{sfnb|Yao|Zhao|2010|pp=113-116}}

[[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy calls for paying respect to one's ancestors, an aspect of [[filial piety]]; Zhuo Xinping (2011) views traditional patriarchal religion as the religious organisation complementing the ideology of Confucianism.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=281}} As the "bedrock faith of the Chinese", traditional patriarchal religion influences the religious psychology of all Chinese and has influenced the other religions of China,{{sfnb|He|2012}} as it is evident in the worship of founders of temples and schools of thought in [[Taoism]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]].

Ancestor veneration practices prevail in south China, where lineage bonds are stronger and the patrilineal hierarchy is not based upon [[agnatic seniority|seniority]], and access to corporate resources held by a lineage is based upon the equality of all the lines of descent;{{sfnb|Wu|2014|p=20|ps=. Quote: «[...] southern China refers to Fujian and Guangdong province and in some cases is expanded to include Guangxi, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Historically speaking, these areas had the strong lineage organizations and the territorial cult, compared to the rest of China in the late imperial period. These areas not only were the first to revive lineage and the territorial cult in the reform era, but also have the intensity and scale of revivals that cannot be matched by the other part of China. This phenomena is furthered referred as the southern model, based on the south-vs.-north model. The north model refers to the absence of landholding cooperative lineages that exist in the south.» Note 16: The south-vs.-north model comparison has been the thrust of historical and anthropological research. Cohen’s article on “Lineage organization in North China (1990)” offers the best summary on the contrast between the north model and the south model. He calls the north China model “the fixed genealogical mode of agnatic kinship.” By which, he means “patrilineal ties are figured on the basis of the relative seniority of descent lines so that the unity of the lineage as a whole is based upon a ritual focus on the senior descent line trace back to the founding ancestor, his eldest son, and the succession of eldest sons.” (ibid: 510) In contrast, the south China model is called “the associational mode of patrilineal kinship.” In this mode, all lines of descent are equal. “Access to corporate resources held by a lineage or lineage segment is based upon the equality of kinship ties asserted in the associational mode.” However, the distinction between the north and the south model is somewhat arbitrary. Some practices of the south model are found in north China. Meanwhile, the so-call north model is not exclusive to north China. The set of characteristics of the north model (a distinctive arrangement of cemeteries, graves, ancestral scrolls, ancestral tablets, and corporate groups linked to a characteristic annual ritual cycle) is not a system. In reality, lineage organizations display a mixture between the south and the north model.»}} whereas in north China [[Chinese communal deity religion|worship of communal deities]] is prevalent.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|pp. 12-13Overmyer, 2009. pp=12-13|ps=. "As for the physical and social structure of villages on this vast flat expanse; they consist of close groups of houses built on a raised area, surrounded by their fields, with a multi-surnamed population of families who own and cultivate their own land, though usually not much more than twenty ''mou'' or about three acres. [...] Families of different surnames living in one small community meant that lineages were not strong enough to maintain lineage shrines and cross-village organizations, so, at best, they owned small burial plots and took part only in intra-village activities. The old imperial government encouraged villages to manage themselves and collect and hand over their own taxes. [...] leaders were responsible for settling disputes, dealing with local government, organizing crop protection and planning for collective ceremonies. All these factors tended to strengthen the local protective deities and their temples as focal points of village identity and activity. This social context defines North China local religion, and keeps us from wandering off into vague discussions of ‘popular’ and ‘elite’ and relationships with Daoism and Buddhism."}}

Some contemporary scholars in China have adopted the names "Chinese traditional patriarchal religion" (中國傳統宗法性宗教 ''Zhōngguó chuántǒng zōngfǎ xìng zōngjiào'') or "Chinese traditional primordial religion" (中國傳統原生性宗教 ''Zhōngguó chuántǒng yuánshēng xìng zōngjiào'') to define the traditional religious system organised around the worship of ancestor-gods.&lt;ref name="Zhang-Yang"&gt;Zhang Jin, Yang Chunpeng. [http://www.mzb.com.cn/html/Home/report/385824-1.htm “中国传统原生性宗教”的产生和特点 ("Chinese traditional primordial religion": generation and characteristics)]. China Ethnic and Religious Network (中国民族宗教网), 2013. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062002/http://www.mzb.com.cn/html/Home/report/385824-1.htm|date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;China Confucius Network: [http://www.chinakongzi.org/rjwh/ddmj/guoyi/200705/t20070520_2165616.htm 人文主义宗教与宗教人文主义] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115041/http://www.chinakongzi.org/rjwh/ddmj/guoyi/200705/t20070520_2165616.htm|date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Jin and Yang Chunpeng, based at the Folk Religion Institute and Party School Theory Research Section of Xuanen County, in an article on the China Ethnic and Religious Network define Chinese traditional primordial religion as faith in [[God]] ([[Shangdi]])'s original form.&lt;ref name="Zhang-Yang"/&gt;

Mou Zhongjian defines "clan-based traditional patriarchal religion" as "an orthodox religion that was widely accepted by all classes, and had been practiced for thousands of years in ancient China".{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}} Mou also says that this religion was subordinate to the state, it was "diverse and inclusive" and had "a humanistic spirit that emphasises the social, moral function of religion", and is closely related to politics.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}} It refers to:{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|pp=280-281}}
:«[...] The traditional religion that had been in place since the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties. It evolved from the worship of Heaven and ancestors. It had the basic components of a religion, including religious concepts, emotions, and rituals. It had no independent organisation. Instead, it was the kinship structure that fulfilled the functions of religious organisation. The emperor, who was the son of God, was the representative of the people who worshiped Heaven. Elders of the clans and parents represented the family in the worship of ancestors. Respecting Heaven and honoring ancestors (''jingtian fazu''), taking good care in seeing off the deceased, and maintaining sacrifices to distant ancestors (''shenzhong zhuiyuan'') were the basic religious concepts and emotional expressions in this religion. [...]»

According to Zhuo Xinping (2011), Chinese patriarchal religion and Confucianism complemented each other in ancient China, as the Confucian religion traditionally lacked a social religious organisation while traditional patriarchal religion lacked an ideological doctrine.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}}

In [[Chinese folk religion]], a person is thought to have multiple souls, categorized as [[Hun and po|''hun'' and ''po'']], commonly associated with [[yin and yang|yang and yin]], respectively. Upon death, ''hun'' and ''po'' separate. Generally, the former ascends into heaven and latter descends into the earth and/or resides within a [[spirit tablet]]; however, beliefs concerning the number and nature of souls vary.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Richard J. Smith (2007). ''Settling the Dead: Funerals, Memorials and Beliefs Concerning the Afterlife''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from Living in the Chinese Cosmos: Understanding Religion in Late-Imperial China: http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/cosmos/prb/journey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with these traditional beliefs, various practices have arisen to address the perceived needs of the deceased.

===Mourning===
The mourning of a loved one usually involves elaborate rituals, which vary according to region and sect. The intensity of the mourning is thought to reflect the quality of relationship one had with the deceased. From the time of Confucius until the 20th century, a three-year mourning period was often prescribed, mirroring the first three years in a child's life when they are utterly dependent upon and loved unconditionally by their parents. These mourning practices would often include wearing sackcloth or simple garb, leaving hair unkempt, eating a restricted diet of [[congee]] two times a day, living in a mourning shack placed beside the house, and moaning in pain at certain intervals of the day. It is said{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} that after the death of Confucius his followers engaged in this three-year mourning period to symbolize their commitment to his teachings.

===Funeral rites===
[[File:Cangnan - Longgang - P1210226 - funeral procession.JPG|thumb|A funeral procession in Zhejiang province]]
Funerals are considered to be a part of the normal process of family life, serving as a cornerstone in inter-generational traditions. The primary goals, regardless of religious beliefs, are to demonstrate obeisance and provide comfort for the deceased. Other goals include: to protect the descents of the deceased from malevolent spirits and to ensure the proper separation and direction of the deceased's soul into the afterlife.

Some common elements of Chinese funerals include the expression of grief through prolonged, often exaggerated wailing; the wearing of white mortuary clothes by the family of the deceased; a ritual washing of the corpse, followed by its attiring in grave clothes; the transfer of symbolic goods such as money and food from the living to the dead; the preparation and installation of a [[spirit tablet]] or the use of a [[Shi (personator)|personator]], often symbolic. Sometimes, ritual specialists such as Taoist priests or Buddhist monks would be hired to perform specific rites, often accompanied by the playing of music or chanting of scripture to drive away evil spirits.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;Thompson, L. G. (1979). ''Chinese Religion: An Introduction Third Edition''. Belmont, California: Wadsworth, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

===Burial===
[[File:Cangnan - Jinxiang - Qiantoulian - P1210370.JPG|thumb|A typical traditional hill slope cemetery of China's southeastern coast]]
Burial is often delayed according to wealth; the coffin would remain in the main room of the family home until it has been properly prepared for burial. More traditionally, this delay is pre-determined according to social status: the corpse of a king or [[Emperor of China|emperor]] would be held in abeyance for seven months; magnates, five; other officers, three; commoners, one.

In some instances, a "lucky burial" can take place several years after the burial. The bones are dug up, washed, dried, and stored in an earthenware jar. After a period of storage, the contents are then interred in their final resting place in a location selected by an [[Feng Shui|augur]] to optimize the flow of ''[[qi]]''. A bad ''qi'' flow could result in a disgruntled spirit who could possibly haunt their descendants.&lt;ref name="religionfacts"&gt;ReligionFacts. (2005, June 2). ''Ancestor Veneration''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from www.religionfacts.com: http://www.religionfacts.com/chinese_religion/practices/ancestor_worship.htm &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;

The deceased would often be buried with sacrifices, typically things one was thought to be in need of in the afterlife. This was done as a symbolic demonstration of filial piety or grandeur. For the wealthy and powerful, bronze vessels, oracle bones, and human or animal sacrifices often accompanied the deceased into the grave. More common sacrifices included candles and incense, as well as offerings of wine and food.

===Continued obeisance===
After the funeral, families often install an ancestral tablet at a household altar alongside other deceased ancestors. This act symbolically unifies the ancestors and honors the family lineage. Incense is lit before the altar daily, significant announcements are made before them, and offerings such as favorite foods, beverages, and [[joss paper|spirit money]] are given bi-monthly and on special occasions, such as [[Qingming Festival]] and [[Ghost Festival]].&lt;ref name="religionfacts"/&gt;

[[Prayer]] was usually performed at the household altar in a separate room containing the ''po'' of their ancestors. The eldest male would speak to the altar on a regular basis. In some belief systems where special powers are ascribed to the deceased, he may supplicate the spirit to bless the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1383">In the writing of [[Michel Foucault]], the '''author function''' is the author as a function of discourse. The term was developed by [[Michel Foucault]] in his 1969 essay "[[What Is an Author?]]" where he discusses whether a text requires or is assigned an author.

Foucault posits that the [[legal system]] was central in the rise of the [[author]], as an author was needed (in order to be punished) for making [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] statements. This is made evident through the rise of the printing press during the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], when religious texts that circulated challenged the authority of the [[Catholic Church]].

The author function does not affect all texts in the same way. For example, the author of a science [[Textbook|text book]] is not as clear or definable as the author of a well known [[novel]]. It is not a spontaneous creation or entity, but a carefully constructed social position.

Reagan cites a variety of ancient and contemporary cultures as the inspiration for these practices including the [[Olmec]], the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and the [[Toltec]], though previously he claimed that these practices were [[Cherokee]].

Published 27 January 1993; accessed 7 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to Reagan and his followers, the "Quodoushka teachings" (also known as "the "Q" to adherents), guided exercises and rituals are credited by believers with allowing a person to improve relationships and reach "higher levels" of orgasm and sexual ecstasy.&lt;ref name=offends/&gt;&lt;ref name="HBO"&gt;See the [[Home Box Office]] episode of "Real Sex in America" (1992) featuring Reagan and a Chuluaqui Quodoushka retreat.&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations at Chuluaqui Quodoushka retreats include male and female self-pleasuring techniques,&lt;ref name="HBO"/&gt; close up examinations to show variations in the shapes of genitalia,&lt;ref name="HBO"/&gt; and participants having sexual intercourse while Reagan and other trainers watch and "coach" them.&lt;ref name=offends/&gt;&lt;ref name="HBO"/&gt;
 
===Criticism===
The sexual rites of passage which Reagan references as being drawn from spiritual practices of the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Toltec]] cultures, and what he claims are secret societies within the [[Cherokee]] Nation, have been denounced as fraudulent by the traditional teachers of these cultures.&lt;ref name="Sacred Orgasm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagan/&gt;&lt;ref name=offends/&gt;&lt;ref name=Giago/&gt;

Many cultures contain rites of passage - usually social and spiritual ceremonies held as a child moves into adulthood. Reagan claims to take inspiration from these ceremonies. However, Reagan's many critics agree that Reagan's claims of what these ceremonies consist of stands in stark contrast to the actual teachings and beliefs of the cultures he claims to represent.&lt;ref name="Sacred Orgasm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagan/&gt;&lt;ref name=offends/&gt;&lt;ref name=Giago/&gt; The Cherokee Nation disavows Reagan's claims entirely, noting that Reagan is not an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, nor is he a member of any Cherokee community. After being denounced by the Cherokee Nation,&lt;ref name="Sacred Orgasm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagan/&gt;&lt;ref name=offends/&gt;&lt;ref name=Giago/&gt; Reagan abruptly changed his back story and now claims the teachings are inspired by a variety of cultures.

===Language===
In the workshops a woman's [[genitalia]] are called "Tupuli", which Reagan claims is a [[Cherokee]] term for "sacred black hole of creation," and a man's [[genitalia]] are referred to as "Tipilli" also claimed by Reagan to be a [[Cherokee]] term meaning "like a tipi pole." However, according to Durbin Feeling, who is a linguistic specialist for the [[Cherokee]] Nation,&lt;ref name=Feeling1&gt;Murphy, Jami, "[http://www.cherokeephoenix.org/Article/Index/5964 Cherokee Translators: Curiosity leads Feeling to Cherokee literacy]" in the ''Cherokee Phoenix'', 14 February 2012; retrieved 7 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; there are no such words in the [[Cherokee]] language, and Cherokee do not and never have lived in [[tipi]]s. In fact, the word "tipili" applied to genitals is likely taken from [[Gary Jennings]]' novel, ''[[Aztec]]''. Feeling said ''Chu-Lua-Qui'' refers to Cherokee people; he said the closest translation he could find for ''Quodoushka'' is "(a)qwv-tol u- ska" a graphic term for a male sexual organ that has nothing to do with Cherokee spirituality. "It's pretty ugly. I don't know if he (Harley Reagan) realizes what it means." Feeling added as an afterthought, "He probably does know what it means."{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Credentials===
Despite the claims that the Chuluaqui Quodoushka is based on ancient traditions there is no corroborating evidence for this.

Much of the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] religious tradition is still not understood by scholars and there is no surviving information about Mayan sex rituals.

The [[Olmecs]] were a people in [[Mexico]] who predated the Aztecs. Their culture disappeared and the only clues left about them are some stone statues and hieroglyphic carvings. Olmec mythology has left no documents and therefore cannot have anything to do with modern-day sex rituals.

Reagan claims that the teachings are also [[Toltec]] in origin, also unsubstantiated.

The [[Cherokee]] Nation firmly denies any involvement in the Chuluaqui-Quodoushka. [[Harley Reagan]] appeared on the [[Home Box Office]] program "Real Sex in America" in 1992, promoting his sex therapy "Quodoushka" as a Cherokee ritual. The chief of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma at the time, [[Wilma Mankiller]], threatened to sue HBO for misrepresentation, and a resolution was passed by the Cherokee condemning Reagan and other "[[plastic shaman]]s".&lt;ref name=Giago/&gt; It is believed by some that in order to avoid a lawsuit, Reagan changed his story to the claim that Quodoushka is a blend of many ancient sexual traditions.&lt;ref name=offends/&gt;

Dr. Richard Allen, a research and policy analyst of the Cherokee Nation, says of the Chuluaqui Quodoushka, "Reagan's made it up. We learn about sex like everyone else does, behind the barn."&lt;ref name="Sacred Orgasm"/&gt;

===Proponents===
One of the fans of the "Q" is porn star [[Porsche Lynn]] who studied with Harley Reagan and has praised the "Q" workshops.

===In film===
A movie called "Quodoushka, Native American Love Techniques" (or "Quodoushka") came out in 1991, distributed by Vivid Video and starring such hard-core porn actresses as Ashley Nicole, Heather Hart, [[Hyapatia Lee]] and Madison. Porn star Hyapatia Lee was a student of Harley Reagan, and claims to be of Cherokee descent.  The film itself is a pornographic film made to look as though it is a documentary. The film depicts various women of supposed Cherokee ancestry copulating in various ways with mostly white men.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5310">'''Circulus''' was a [[socioeconomics]] doctrine devised by nineteenth-century French [[Utopian socialism|utopian]] [[socialist]] [[Pierre Leroux]] (1797-1871), who proposed that human [[excrement]] be collected by the state in the form of a [[tax]] and used as [[fertiliser]], thereby increasing agricultural production sufficiently to prevent [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

== The theory ==
According to Leroux, human excrement has remarkable fertilising properties, which society fails to harness. The human waste that is otherwise discarded would fertilise agricultural production sufficient to cover society's progressively increasing food consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[Pierre Jannet, J. F. Payen, Auguste Alexandre Veinant] ''Bibliotheca Scatologica, ou catalogue raisonné des livres traitant des vertus faits et gestes de très noble et très ingénieux'' [Paris: Imprimerie Guiraudet et Jouaust, 1849], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux posits the existence of a natural law dependent on the circulation of human excrement back through the agricultural process and which maintains a necessary balance between soil fertility and inexorable population growth.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Revue de l'ordre social'' (No. 1, 1850, p.&amp;nbsp;6), Leroux responded to his critics, summing up his theory as follows: "Si les hommes étaient croyants, savants, religieux, ajoute-t-il, au lieu de rire, comme ils le font, du socialisme, ils professeraient avec respect et vénération la doctrine du circulus. Chacun recueillerait ''religieusement'' son fumier pour le donner à l’état, c’est-à-dire au percepteur, en guise d’impôt ou de contribution personelle. La production agricole serait immédiatement doublée, et la misère disparaîtrait du globe"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; (If men were believers, learned, religious, then, rather than laughing at socialism, as they do, they would profess the doctrine of circulus with respect and veneration. Each would religiously collect his dung to give it to the state, that is, to the tax-collector, by way of an impost or personal contribution. Agricultural production would instantly be doubled, and poverty would vanish from the globe).

== Origin and history of the theory ==
Leroux first put forward his theory of circulus in 1834, as part of an attempt to explain the failure of a [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] [[phalanstery]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Reid, ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen: Realities and Representations'', Harvard University Press, 1991, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Madame Baudet-Dulary, astonished at the failure of the utopian community established on her land, Fourier himself is supposed to have said: "Madame, donnez-moi fumier" (Madame, give me dung).&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Laporte, ''Histoire de la Merde'', Christian Bourgois, Editeur, Paris, 1978, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite public ridicule,&lt;ref&gt;See for example Alfred Sudre, who derides Leroux's theory in ''Histoire du communisme: ou, Réfutation historique des utopies socialistes'' (4th edition, Alfred Pagny, Éditeur, Brussels, 1850, p. 309), as follows: "M. Pierre Leroux s’écrie: Pour renverser le Léviathan de l’économie politique, il me suffit… d’un détritus" (Monsieur Pierre Leroux cries out: to overturn the Leviathan of the political economy, all I need is... a piece of waste).&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux held firm to his theory in the decades that followed and, while living in exile in [[Jersey]] after the fall of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], he carried out experiments using his own excrement as fertiliser in an attempt to persuade the local authorities to adopt the doctrine of circulus.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Leroux's theory did gain the sympathetic ear of fellow exile [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the digression on the sewers of Paris in ''[[Les Misérables]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"L'intestin de Léviathan", Book Five, Part Two.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo would seem to have been influenced by Leroux's diagnosis of socio-economic ills when he declares that the present sewerage system is "a misunderstanding" ("Un égout est un malentendu"), a negligent waste ("coulage") of public wealth ("la richesse publique"), and that were the "givens of a new social economy" ("les données d'une économie sociale nouvelle") applied to human waste, then the problem of poverty would be attenuated.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Misérables'', ed. Guy Rosa and Nicole Savy, Le Livre de Poche, 1985, vol. 2, p. 1685.&lt;/ref&gt; But in practical terms, rather than by Leroux's vision of individual members of society willingly paying a tax in their own excrement for the sake of the common weal, Hugo's collector sewers were sooner inspired by the ideas of English social reformer [[Edwin Chadwick]], who proposed that human waste be pumped from cities to the countryside to provide fertiliser for crops to feed those very cities, thereby completing "the circle and [realising] the Egyptian type of eternity by bringing as it were the serpent's tail into the serpent's mouth".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1449">A '''constructional system''' or a '''constitution system''' is a system of objects or concepts of a certain domain in which all objects or concepts of that domain can be logically constructed from a proper subset of those objects or concepts, called the ''basis'' of the system. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohnitz|Rossberg|2014|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of constructional systems can be traced back to [[Bertrand Russell]], who wrote in 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1914|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that 
{{quote|The supreme maxim in scientific philosophising is this: wherever possible logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred entities.}}

German philosopher [[Rudolf Carnap]] in his ''Der logische Aufbau der Welt'' (1928) (referring to them as "Konstitutionssystems") and American philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] in his ''The Structure of Appearance'' (1951) studied the structure of constructional systems.

'''Continental philosophy''' is a set of 19th- and 20th-century [[Philosophy|philosophical]] traditions from [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leiter|2007|p=2}}: "As a first approximation, we might say that philosophy in Continental Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is best understood as a connected weave of traditions, some of which overlap, but no one of which dominates all the others."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-first=Simon |editor-last=Critchley |editor2-first=William |editor2-last=Schroder|first=Simon|last=Critchley|contribution=Introduction: what is continental philosophy?|title=A Companion to Continental Philosophy|series=Blackwell Companions to Philosophy|location=Malden, MA|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|year=1998|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of the term originated among English-speaking philosophers in the second half of the 20th century, who used it to refer to a range of thinkers and traditions outside the [[analytic philosophy|analytic movement]]. Continental philosophy includes the following movements: [[German idealism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]] (and its antecedents, such as the thought of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]), [[hermeneutics]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[deconstruction]], [[Feminism in France|French feminism]], [[psychoanalytic theory]], and the [[critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]] and related branches of [[Western Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;The above list includes only those movements common to both lists compiled by {{harvnb|Critchley|2001|p=13}} and {{harvnb|Glendinning|2006|pp=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to identify non-trivial claims that would be common to all the preceding philosophical movements. The term "continental philosophy", like "[[analytic philosophy]]", lacks clear definition and may mark merely a [[family resemblance]] across disparate philosophical views. [[Simon Glendinning]] has suggested that the term was originally more pejorative than descriptive, functioning as a label for types of western philosophy rejected or disliked by analytic philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glendinning|2006|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[Michael E. Rosen]] has ventured to identify common themes that typically characterize continental philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;The following list of four traits is adapted from {{citation |first=Michael|last= Rosen|contribution=Continental Philosophy from Hegel|editor-first=A.C. |editor-last=Grayling|title=Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject|page=665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*First, continental philosophers generally reject the view that the [[natural science]]s are the only or most accurate way of understanding natural phenomena. This contrasts with many analytic philosophers who consider their inquiries as continuous with, or subordinate to, those of the natural sciences. Continental philosophers often argue that science depends upon a "pre-theoretical substrate of experience" (a version of [[Kantianism|Kantian]] conditions of possible experience or the phenomenological "[[lifeworld]]") and that scientific methods are inadequate to fully understand such conditions of intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Critchley|2001|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Second, continental philosophy usually considers these conditions of possible experience as variable: determined at least partly by factors such as context, space and time, language, culture, or history. Thus continental philosophy tends toward [[historicism]] (or [[Historicity (philosophy)|historicity]]). Where analytic philosophy tends to treat philosophy in terms of discrete problems, capable of being analyzed apart from their historical origins (much as scientists consider the history of science inessential to scientific inquiry), continental philosophy typically suggests that "philosophical argument cannot be divorced from the textual and contextual conditions of its historical emergence".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Critchley|2001|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Third, continental philosophy typically holds that human agency can change these conditions of possible experience: "if human experience is a contingent creation, then it can be recreated in other ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Critchley|2001|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus continental philosophers tend to take a strong interest in the unity of theory and practice, and often see their philosophical inquiries as closely related to personal, moral, or political transformation. This tendency is very clear in the Marxist tradition ("[[Theses on Feuerbach|philosophers have only ''interpreted'' the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to ''change'' it]]"), but is also central in existentialism and post-structuralism.
*A final characteristic trait of continental philosophy is an emphasis on [[metaphilosophy]]. In the wake of the development and success of the natural sciences, continental philosophers have often sought to redefine the method and nature of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leiter|2007|p=4}}: "While forms of philosophical naturalism have been dominant in Anglophone philosophy, the vast majority of authors within the Continental traditions insist on the distinctiveness of philosophical methods and their priority to those of the natural sciences."&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases (such as German idealism or phenomenology), this manifests as a renovation of the traditional view that philosophy is the first, foundational, ''a priori'' science. In other cases (such as hermeneutics, critical theory, or structuralism), it is held that philosophy investigates a domain that is irreducibly cultural or practical. And some continental philosophers (such as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, the later [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], or [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]) doubt whether any conception of philosophy can coherently achieve its stated goals.

Ultimately, the foregoing themes derive from a broadly Kantian thesis that knowledge, experience, and reality are bound and shaped by conditions best understood through philosophical reflection rather than exclusively empirical inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Continental philosophers usually identify such conditions with the transcendental subject or self: {{harvnb|Solomon|1988|p=6}}, "It is with Kant that philosophical claims about the self attain new and remarkable proportions. The self becomes not just the focus of attention but the entire subject-matter of philosophy. The self is not just another entity in the world, but in an important sense it creates the world, and the reflecting self does not just know itself, but in knowing itself knows all selves, and the structure of any and every possible self."&lt;/ref&gt;

== The term ==
[[File:Henri Bergson (Nobel).jpg|alt=Henri Bergson|thumb|[[Henri Bergson]]]]
The term "continental philosophy", in the above sense, was first widely used by English-speaking philosophers to describe university courses in the 1970s, emerging as a collective name for the philosophies then widespread in France and Germany, such as phenomenology, existentialism, structuralism, and post-structuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Critchley|2001|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term (and its approximate sense) can be found at least as early as 1840, in [[John Stuart Mill]]'s 1840 essay on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], where Mill contrasts the Kantian-influenced thought of "Continental philosophy" and "Continental philosophers" with the English empiricism of [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and the 18th century generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Stuart|last=Mill|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|title=On Bentham and Coleridge|location=New York|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|series=Harper Torchbooks|year=1950|pages=104, 133, 155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This notion gained prominence in the early 20th century as figures such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G. E. Moore]] advanced a vision of philosophy closely allied with natural science, progressing through logical analysis. This tradition, which has come to be known broadly as "analytic philosophy", became dominant in Britain and the United States from roughly 1930 onward. Russell and Moore made a dismissal of [[Hegelianism]] and its philosophical relatives a distinctive part of their new movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bertrand|last=Russell|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=My Philosophical Development|location=London|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1959|page=62|quote=Hegelians had all kinds of arguments to prove this or that was not 'real'. Number, space, time, matter, were all professedly convicted of being self-contradictory. Nothing was real, so we were assured, except the Absolute, which could think only of itself since there was nothing else for it to think of and which thought eternally the sort of things that idealist philosophers thought in their books.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commenting on the history of the distinction in 1945, Russell distinguished "two schools of philosophy, which may be broadly distinguished as the Continental and the British respectively", a division he saw as operative "from the time of Locke".&lt;ref&gt;B. Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1945), p. 643 and 641.  Russell proposes the following broad points of distinction between Continental and British types of philosophy: (1) in method, [[deductive system]]-building vs. piecemeal induction; (2) in metaphysics, rationalist theology vs. metaphysical agnosticism; (3) in ethics, non-naturalist deontology vs. naturalist hedonism; and (4) in politics, authoritarianism vs. liberalism.  Ibid., pp. 643-647.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, however, many philosophers in the United States and Britain have taken interest in continental philosophers since Kant, and the philosophical traditions in many European countries have similarly incorporated many aspects of the "analytic" movement.  Self-described analytic philosophy flourishes in France, including philosophers such as [[Jules Vuillemin]], [[Vincent Descombes]], [[Gilles Gaston Granger]], [[François Recanati]], and [[Pascal Engel]]. Likewise, self-described "continental philosophers" can be found in philosophy departments in the United Kingdom, North America, and Australia,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Walter Brogan and James Risser (eds.), ''American Continental Philosophy: A Reader'' (Indiana University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and some well-known analytic philosophers claim to conduct better scholarship on continental philosophy than self-identified programs in continental philosophy, particularly at the level of graduate education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] is most commonly associated with such claims.&lt;/ref&gt; "Continental philosophy" is thus defined in terms of a family of philosophical traditions and influences rather than a geographic distinction.

==History&lt;!--'History of continental philosophy' and 'History of Continental philosophy' redirect here--&gt;==
[[File:Heidegger 4 (1960).jpg|thumb|[[Martin Heidegger]]]]
The history of continental philosophy (taken in its narrower sense) is usually thought to begin with [[German idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Critchley|2001}} and {{harvnb|Solomon|1988}} date the origins of continental philosophy a generation earlier, to the work of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Led by figures like [[Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and later [[Hegel]], German idealism developed out of the work of [[Immanuel Kant]] in the 1780s and 1790s and was closely linked with [[romanticism]] and the revolutionary politics of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  Besides the central figures listed above, important contributors to German idealism also included [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]], [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]], and [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]].

As the institutional roots of "continental philosophy" in many cases directly descend from those of phenomenology,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the largest academic organization devoted to furthering the study of continental philosophy is the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Husserl]] has always been a canonical figure in continental philosophy. Nonetheless, Husserl is also a respected subject of study in the analytic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Anthony (ed). ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Western Philosophy''. {{ISBN|0-19-285440-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl's notion of a [[noema]], the non-psychological content of thought, his correspondence with [[Gottlob Frege]], and his investigations into the nature of logic continue to generate interest among analytic philosophers.

[[José Guilherme Merquior|J. G. Merquior]]&lt;ref&gt;Merquior, J.G. (1987). ''Foucault'' ([[Fontana Modern Masters]] series), University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-06062-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that a distinction between analytic and continental philosophies can be first clearly identified with [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), whose wariness of science and elevation of [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]] paved the way for [[existentialism]]. Merquior wrote: "the most prestigious philosophizing in France took a very dissimilar path [from the Anglo-Germanic analytic schools]. One might say it all began with Henri Bergson."

An illustration of some important differences between "analytic" and "continental" styles of philosophy can be found in [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s "Elimination of Metaphysics through Logical Analysis of Language" (originally published in 1932 as "Überwindung der Metaphysik durch Logische Analyse der Sprache"), a paper some observers{{Who|date=September 2011}} have described as particularly polemical. Carnap's paper argues that Heidegger's lecture "What Is Metaphysics?" violates logical syntax to create nonsensical pseudo-statements.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Wanda T. [http://www.unt.edu/csph/Vol_01_winter00/torres-gregory_art.htm Heidegger, Carnap and Quine at the Crossroads of Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821213605/http://www.unt.edu/csph/Vol_01_winter00/torres-gregory_art.htm |date=2006-08-21 }}, and Abraham D. Stone. [http://people.ucsc.edu/~abestone/papers/uberwindung.pdf Heidegger and Carnap on the Overcoming of Metaphysics]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Carnap claimed that many German metaphysicians of the era were similar to Heidegger in writing statements that were syntactically meaningless.

With the rise of [[Nazism]], many of Germany's philosophers, especially those of Jewish descent or leftist or liberal political sympathies (such as many in the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Frankfurt School]]), fled to the English-speaking world.  Those philosophers who remained—if they remained in academia at all—had to reconcile themselves to [[Nazi]] control of the universities.  Others, such as [[Martin Heidegger]], among the most prominent German philosophers to stay in Germany, developed a diplomatic relationship with Nazism when it came to power.

Both before and after [[World War II]] there was a growth of interest in German philosophy in [[France]]. A new interest in communism translated into an interest in Marx and Hegel, who became for the first time studied extensively in the politically conservative French university system of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. At the same time the phenomenological philosophy of Husserl and Heidegger became increasingly influential, perhaps owing to its resonances with French philosophies which placed great stock in the first-person perspective (an idea found in divergent forms such as [[Cartesianism]], [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualism]], and Bergsonism). Most important in this popularization of phenomenology was the author and philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who called his philosophy [[existentialism]]. (See [[20th-century French philosophy]].) Another major strain of continental thought is [[structuralism]]/[[post-structuralism]]. Influenced by the [[structural linguistics]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], French anthropologists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] began to apply the structural paradigm to the humanities. In the 1960s and '70s, post-structuralists developed various critiques of structuralism. Post-structuralist thinkers include [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].

== Recent Anglo-American developments ==

From the early 20th century until the 1960s, continental philosophers were only intermittently discussed in British and American universities, despite an influx of continental philosophers, particularly [[German Jews|German Jewish]] students of Nietzsche and Heidegger, to the United States on account of the persecution of the Jews and later [[World War II]]; [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], and [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] are probably the most notable of this wave, arriving in the late 1930s and early 1940s. However, philosophy departments began offering courses in continental philosophy in the late 1960s and 1970s. 

American university departments in literature, the fine arts, film, sociology, and political theory have increasingly incorporated ideas and arguments from continental philosophers into their curricula and research. Continental Philosophy features prominently in a number of British and Irish Philosophy departments, for instance at the University of Essex, Warwick, Sussex and Dundee, Manchester Metropolitan, Kingston University, Staffordshire University and University College Dublin, and in North American Philosophy departments, including the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, Boston College, Stony Brook University (SUNY), Vanderbilt University, DePaul University,  Villanova University, the University of Guelph, The New School, Pennsylvania State University, University of Oregon, Emory University, Duquesne University, the University of Memphis, [[University of King's College]], and Loyola University Chicago. The most prominent organization for continental philosophy in the United States is the [[Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy]] (known as SPEP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spep.org Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryptocat''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[Application software|desktop application]] intended to allow encrypted [[online chat]]ting available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://crypto.cat/index.html|title=Cryptocat|website=crypto.cat|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses [[end-to-end encryption]] to secure all communications to other Cryptocat users. Users are given the option of independently verifying their buddies' device lists and are notified when a buddy's device list is modified and all updates are verified through the built-in update downloader.&lt;ref name="Cryptocat-Security"/&gt;

Cryptocat is developed by [[Nadim Kobeissi]] and a community of open source contributors and is published under the terms of the [[GPLv3]] license.

==History==
Cryptocat was first launched on 19 May 2011 as a [[web application]].

In June 2012, Kobeissi said he was detained at the U.S. border by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] and questioned about Cryptocat's censorship resistance. He tweeted about the incident afterwards, resulting in media coverage and a spike in the popularity of the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jon Matonis |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/06/07/detaining-developer-at-us-border-increases-cryptocat-popularity |title=Detaining Developer At US Border Increases Cryptocat Popularity |publisher=Forbes |date=2012-04-18 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=67866 |title=Developer's detention spikes interest in Montreal's Cryptocat |publisher=Itbusiness.ca |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, security researcher Steve Thomas pointed out a security bug that could be used to decrypt any group chat message that had taken place using Cryptocat between September 2012 and April 19, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Thomas |url=http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php|title=DecryptoCat |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cryptocat Development Blog"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cryptocat Development Blog |url=https://blog.crypto.cat/2013/07/new-critical-vulnerability-in-cryptocat-details/|title=New Critical Vulnerability in Cryptocat: Details |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private messages were not affected, and the bug had been resolved a month prior. In response, Cryptocat issued a security advisory, requested that all users ensure that they had upgraded, and informed users that past group conversations may have been compromised.&lt;ref name="Cryptocat Development Blog"/&gt;

In February 2014, an audit by iSec Partners criticized Cryptocat's authentication model as insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;https://isecpartners.github.io/publications/iSEC_Cryptocat_iOS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Cryptocat made improvements to user authentication, making it easier for users to authenticate and detect [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cryptocat |url=https://blog.crypto.cat/2014/04/recent-audits-and-coming-improvements/ |title=Recent Audits and Coming Improvements |accessdate=2014-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015215301/https://blog.crypto.cat/2014/04/recent-audits-and-coming-improvements/ |archivedate=2014-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, citing dissatisfaction with the project's current state after 19 months of non-maintenance, Kobeissi announced that he would be taking Cryptocat temporarily offline and discontinuing the development of its mobile application, pending a complete rewrite and relaunch of the software.&lt;ref name="Paletta-22-February-2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paletta|first1=Damian|title=How the U.S. Fights Encryption—and Also Helps Develop It|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-u-s-fights-encryptionand-also-helps-develop-it-1456109096|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=News Corp|date=22 February 2016|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 Kobeissi announced the re-release of Cryptocat, rewritten completely as desktop software instead of the original web application software, as a public beta and the resumption of the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://crypto.cat/news.html#3.0.16|title=Cryptocat Release Announcement|website=crypto.cat|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new desktop-centric approach allowed Cryptocat to benefit from stronger desktop integration, in a style similar to [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]].

==Features==
Cryptocat allows its users to set up [[End-to-end encryption|end-to-end encrypted]] chat conversations. Users can exchange one-to-one messages, encrypted files, photos as well as create and share audio/video recordings. All devices linked to Cryptocat accounts will receive [[Forward secrecy|forward secure]] messages, even when offline.

All messages, files and audio/video recordings sent over Cryptocat are end-to-end encrypted. Cryptocat users link their devices to their Cryptocat account upon connection, and can identify each other's devices via the client's device manager in order to prevent [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s. Cryptocat also employs a [[Trust on first use]] mechanism in order to help detect device identity key changes.

Cryptocat also includes a built-in auto-update mechanism that automatically performs a signature check on downloaded updates in order to verify authenticity, and employs TLS [[certificate pinning]] in order to prevent network impersonation attacks.

Originally in 2013, Cryptocat offered the ability to connect to Facebook Messenger to initiate encrypted chatting with other Cryptocat users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Quinn | last=Norton | title=Cryptocat Creates an Encrypted, Disposable Chatroom on Any Computer with a Web Browser | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/12/crypto-for-the-masses-here-s-how-you-can-resist-the-nsa.html | newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=12 May 2014 | accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the developers, the feature was meant to help offer an alternative to the regular Cryptocat chat model which did not offer long-term contact lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cryptocat |url=https://blog.crypto.cat/2014/05/cryptocat-now-with-encrypted-facebook-chat/ |title=Cryptocat, Now with Encrypted Facebook Chat |accessdate=2014-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111151356/https://blog.crypto.cat/2014/05/cryptocat-now-with-encrypted-facebook-chat/ |archivedate=2014-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature was disconnected in November 2015.

==Reception and usage==
In June 2013, Cryptocat was used by journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] while in [[Hong Kong]] to meet [[NSA]] whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] for the first time, after other encryption software failed to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |date=May 13, 2014 |title=No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State |url=http://glenngreenwald.net |publisher=Metropolitan Books |page=59 |isbn=978-1627790734 |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Cryptocat was banned in [[Iran]], shortly after the election of Iran's new president [[Hassan Rouhani]] who had promised more open Internet laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lorenzo | last=Franceschi-Bicchierai | title=Iran Blocks Encrypted Chat Service Despite Claims of Internet Freedom | url=http://mashable.com/2013/11/21/iran-blocks-cryptocat/ | newspaper=[[Mashable]] |date=21 November 2013 | accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptocat was listed on the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]'s "Secure Messaging Scorecard" from 4 November 2014 until 13 March 2016. During that time, Cryptocat had a score of 7 out of 7 points on the scorecard. It had received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the provider did not have access to ([[end-to-end encryption]]), making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondent's identities, having past communications secure if the keys were stolen ([[forward secrecy]]), having its code open to independent review ([[open-source software|open-source]]), having its security designs well-documented, and having completed an independent security audit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard | publisher = Electronic Frontier Foundation | title = Secure Messaging Scorecard. Which apps and tools actually keep your messages safe? | date = 4 November 2014 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

===Encryption===
Cryptocat uses a [[Double Ratchet Algorithm]] in order to obtain [[forward secrecy|forward]] and future secrecy across messages, after a session is established using a four-way [[Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman]] handshake. The handshake mixes in long-term identity keys, an intermediate-term signed pre-key, and a one-time use prekey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/blob/master/src/js/axolotl.js|title=Cryptocat Axolotl Implementation|website=github.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach is similar to the encryption protocol adopted for encrypted messaging by the [[Signal (software)|Signal]] mobile application. Cryptocat's goal is for its messages to obtain confidentiality, integrity, source authenticity, forward and future secrecy and indistinguishability even over a network controlled by an active attacker.&lt;ref name="Cryptocat-Security"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://crypto.cat/security.html|title=Cryptocat - Security|website=crypto.cat|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forward secrecy features of the protocol that Cryptocat uses are similar to those first introduced by [[Off-the-Record Messaging]].

Cryptocat uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] in [[Galois/Counter Mode]] for authenticated encryption, [[Curve25519]] for Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman shared secret agreement, [[HMAC-SHA256]] for key derivation and [[Ed25519]] for signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/blob/master/src/js/pscl.js|title=Cryptocat Cryptographic Primitives|website=github.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to limit the effect of a long-term identity key compromise, long-term keys are used exclusively once for the initial [[Authenticated Key Exchange]], and once for signing a newly generated intermediate-term signed prekey.

For the transport layer, Cryptocat adopts the [[OMEMO|OMEMO Multi-End Message and Object Encryption]] standard, which also gives Cryptocat multi-device support and allows for offline messaging.&lt;ref name="Cryptocat-Security"/&gt;

===Network===
Cryptocat's network relies on a [[XMPP]] configuration served over [[WebSockets]]. According to the project's mission statement, Cryptocat's network only relays encrypted messages and does not store any data.&lt;ref name="mission-statement"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cryptocat |url=https://crypto.cat/mission.html |title=Cryptocat Mission Statement |accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Cryptocat client's end-to-end encryption protocol, client-server communication is protected by [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].

====Distribution====
From March 2011 until March 2016, Cryptocat was officially distributed through the [[Google Chrome Web Store]], the [[Apple App Store]] and other official channels controlled by targeted platforms. After Cryptocat's re-write into desktop software in March 2016, the software became distributed exclusively through Cryptocat's own servers, which also handle signed update delivery.&lt;ref name="download-server"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cryptocat |url=https://download.crypto.cat/|title=Cryptocat Download Server |accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dalibor Vesely''' (19 June 1934 – 31 March 2015&lt;ref name="AJObituary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/obituary-dalibor-vesely-1934-2015/8680795.article|title=Obituary: Dalibor Vesely (1934 – 2015)|work=[[Architects'_Journal]]|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-born [[architectural historian]] and [[Architectural theory|theorist]] who was influential through his teaching and writing in promoting the role of [[hermeneutics]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as part of the discourse of architecture and of architectural design.

Vesely was one of the most outstanding architectural teachers of the late twentieth century. As well as inspiring generations of students, he taught some of the current leading architects and architectural historians, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Eric Parry]], [[Alberto Pérez-Gómez]], [[Mohsen Mostafavi]] and [[David Leatherbarrow]]. He began teaching at the [[University of Essex]], before moving to  the [[Architectural Association]] in London and in 1978 to the [[University of Cambridge Department of Architecture]], where he also started an M.Phil. programme in History and Philosophy of Architecture with [[Peter Carl]]. Together with Peter Carl, his teaching and theoretical approach became associated and dominated the Cambridge Architecture School in the 1980s and early 1990s. After retiring from his full-time post in Cambridge, Vesely continued to teach there, remaining Director of Studies at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] and he also taught Architectural History and Philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and was an Honorary Professorial Fellow at the [[Manchester School of Architecture]]. In 2005 he was recipient of the CICA Bruno Zevi Book Award granted by the [[International Committee of Architectural Critics]] for his book "Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation". In 2006 the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) honoured Dalibor Vesely with the Annie Spink Award for Excellence in Architectural Education and in 2015 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the RIBA in recognition of both his lifetime contributions to architectural theory and to teaching.  

== Biography ==
Vesely was Born in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]],in 1934. He studied engineering, architecture, art history and philosophy in [[Prague]], [[Munich]], [[Paris]] and [[Heidelberg]] and obtained his PhD from [[Charles University in Prague]]. This was supervised by  [[Josef Havlicek]], [[Karel Honzik]], and [[Jaroslav Fragner]]. He studied with [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], with whom he kept a correspondence until Gadamer's death. He stated it was the philosopher of phenomenology [[Jan Patočka]] who, in his own words, “contributed more than anyone else to [his] overall intellectual orientation and to the articulation of some of the critical topics”  it was under the influence of Gadamer and  Patočka that he developed the lifelong interest in the poetics and hermeneutics of architecture that defined his teaching and research .
Vesely was in England with his brother in 1968 when the Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. He stayed in London, first teaching at the Architectural Association, taking charge of the 'Unit 1' studio and then moving to the [[University of Essex]] where he and [[Joseph Rykwert]] established a Masters Degree in architectural history. He was invited to Cambridge by [[Colin St John Wilson]] in 1978. There he, Rykwert and Peter Carl initiated MPhil and PhD courses in the history and philosophy of architecture, thereby bringing the emerging studio culture which had been cultivated at the AA which came to define the school in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Architecture and hermeneutics ==
Vesely's work may be understood primarily as a contribution to cultural [[hermeneutics]], and his exploration of the historical background of modern science in the sixteenth- and seventeenth centuries is particularly rich in detail and insight onto the changing nature of [[representations (arts)|representation]]. Vesely polemises on concepts such as [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and [[anamorphosis]], which are traditionally understood to have taken departure from [[Renaissance]] culture. Vesely contributes to the current debate with the depth of the problem of representation; a question which has divided [[Western philosophy]] with regard to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] possibility of representation and understanding of natural phenomena. The 'birth' of modern science and its increasing challenge on traditional views has also marked the divide within the possibilities of representation. In the context of the seventeenth century, this was especially clear as a polemics surrounding the nature of scientific work and philosophical understanding.

According to Vesely, the inevitable partiality of such views is at the very core of the problem that affects the cultural understanding of representation. Its contingent nature was not always understood as a divide originating all kinds of dualisms. Before modern science, representation was naturally contingent and the universal aspirations of science ([[metaphysics]]) were bound to the nature of the epistemological ground (''arché''). Vesely's work traces back the [[ontological]] foundations of the problem to the Greek context, helping to clarify its original meaning. In ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation'' (2004), Vesely presents the notion of ''ground'' as having a provisional nature, that can only be seized as a continuity of reference through different levels of representation, ranging from the more explicit, visible world down to a ''latent world'' of potential articulation. Precisely this continuity is what may allow us to address the modern, fragmented notion of representation as a task of rehabilitation, which would trace the fragment back to its original whole.

== Architecture and representation ==
Vesely's written work was mostly in articles in journals and many of the arguments developed over the years in lectures and seminars. There is thus no comprehensive overview of his thought or his range of interests. However ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation'' (2004), provides a summary of his thinking and this work remains the main source for understanding his approach. Many of his other ideas which were expressed in lectures and seminars remain unpublished. 

===Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation===
In ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation'' (2004), Vesely sets the argument from the experience of architecture, as it constantly works through different modes of representation, including "built reality". In it, Vesely defines the present cultural situation as divided and ambiguous, especially when it comes to architecture (pp.&amp;nbsp;4–12, 36, 44 ss). Twentieth-century architecture, he argues, places its trust in the epistemological model of modern science and technology that is today largely reflected in instrumental concepts of city and suburban landscape. Today, he states, the attempt to rehabilitate the primary tradition of architecture faces the problem of bridging the gap between different modes of representation and concepts of [[knowledge]] that in some cases precede modern science, i.e., precede the historical notion of scientific knowledge as it takes course from the seventeenth- and sixteenth centuries.

Vesely's research delved into these historical settings that are understood to be the birthplace of modern science, in the general hope of exposing the origin of our modern notion of [[knowledge]] and how it came about to emancipate from traditional representations of the world. Vesely's research was accordingly a working out the historical notion of representation, as it constituted a central issue in this historical affair; and how the construction of a modern notion of knowledge had much to do with a changing nature in the concept of representation (pp.&amp;nbsp;13–19). The concept as it is generally understood today largely surpasses the history of epistemology. According to Vesely, this is because representation is generally understood on the basis of a certain "continuity between a particular mode of representation and what is represented" (p.&amp;nbsp;14), a notion which has been current throughout the whole of European architectural history.

=== The modern situation===
When looking at the modern situation, Vesely finds that the problem is generally structured on the basis of an ontological difference that is intrinsic to representation itself. This is precisely the difference that allows modes of representation to emancipate from that which is represented, and from particular, given circumstances (pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5). The discussion of ''ontological difference'' therefore constitutes an ''epistemological difference'' affecting the conditions and possibilities of knowledge. And speculative thought, which we so associate with modern science, is built on this difference. Charles Taylor (1995) points out how the question for modern science is to fit a particular mode of representation to another, extrinsic representation: what we commonly call the "outer reality". The difference between the two constantly jeopardizes their epistemological value; and affects not only the way in which representation relates to ''what it means to represent'', but also between different modes of representing it.

In response, Vesely's work explores how architecture constantly works between different modes of representation, through the difference between project and what is built, for instance, when it translates a whole city into a diagram, a plan or a map. The simple act of reading a map involves more than just the imagination to relate the map with the buildings and the surrounding space; it involves the reciprocity between different levels of representation, that may intake discrepancy and lack of information. According to Vesely, this kind of discrepancy might be useful to understand the nature of the question; and may in fact become a means to understand what impairs the communication between different levels of representation, and conversely, what happens when such communication takes place.

Vesely also takes up the example of an experiment that, paradoxically perhaps, was carried out in the hey-day of logical [[empiricism]]. The experiment was carried out by Schilder, and involved a temporary inversion of the visual field (pp.&amp;nbsp;46ss), leaving other perceptual fields untouched. Schilder's experiment addressed the discontinuity between the visual and other fields of [[perception]], and exposed the situated [[human body]] as a basic structure of spatial reference (pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49). Vesely investigates how the subjects of the experiment found that their bodies were the first instance they could rely on when trying to situate in a visual world that was not only upside down, but also turned from left to right; and when trying to perform simple gestures like picking up a book, or reading. Although the experience was difficult to endure, the inverted vision could be partially reconciled with the original body structure (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

According to Vesely, the ability to reconcile the acquired inverted vision with the situational structure of the human body, points out to a deeper problem when dealing with situation, which is related to our ability to become situated on provisional grounds, even when lacking a fundamental 'ground' of spatial or temporal reference. The example from inverted vision also means to show that such a basis is far from being immediate; it is constituted in the process of a search within the actual space and comes about in the reciprocity between different levels and forms of representation such as visual, tactile, and so forth. Vesely elaborates on situation and the phenomenon of being situated as an example of how we contextualize spatial knowledge and on which basis; and on how a particular point of reference allows us to situate spatial [[knowledge]]. In the course of the argument, Vesely demonstrates that what constitutes the fabric of situation is a continuity of reference and experience through different forms of articulating spatiality down to an implicit structure that itself is neither visual nor tactile, and is only potentially articulated in the objective realm (pp.&amp;nbsp;48, 82–87, 378ss).

=== Situation and perception ===
Vesely's argument on the epistemological process of being situated develops in terms of an analogy to the formation of the visual field. And takes the organic ability of sight only as a point of departure to the phenomenon of [[Visual perception|vision]], i.e. what one is able to recognize and know out of visual [[perception]]. Accordingly, the natural process of seeing is shown to be a result from learning. Vesely presents the example of inborn conditions of blindness treated through surgery, where sight itself only emerges after a painful stage of learning, and without which, the recently acquired sense of sight would be unable to detach or recognize individual objects out of a 'visual field' (pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51). Vesely describes how the integration of the newly acquired sense relies on the fact that the world of the blind is already structured, not only in terms of temporal sequences, but spatially; and that the reconciliation of the new ability of sight takes place on an already structured ground of existing objects and spatiality. [[Perception]] such as visual or tactile is reconciled upon an implicitly structured ground.

Vesely shows how the task of bridging different plateaux of representation can only be fulfilled by covering the distance to a common 'ground' (pp.&amp;nbsp;61–63). 'Ground' is like a point of departure from which it would become possible to uncover the basic structure of spatiality; but it is hardly the case that such an epistemological ground can provide us with an absolute source of spatial reference. The notion of epistemological ground is not established a priori, as a given point of reference. It comes about in the process of searching, taking place as a continuum of references between different levels of spatial understanding. In which case, what constitutes the structural source of situation is this ''stream of references'' (p.&amp;nbsp;60).

Vesely's notion of ground consists of a primary source of reference that in many ways coincides with the traditional Greek understanding of ''arché''. ''Arché'' is not an absolute source of reference, but only a primary one that works as a point of departure towards our notion of "earth" and our understanding of "world" (pp.&amp;nbsp;50–52). This is an ''insecure ground'' that in a sense, speaks more of its own [[topography]], than of clearly defined rules and references. Although this is an unfamiliar ground for modern science, Vesely accurately describes how much of the understanding of what it means to be situated derives from the knowledge of daily situations on Earth, where horizon and gravity play a common role. Accordingly, architecture's task of raising and 'building' situations does not address the mere existence of conditions such as floor or gravity, but concerns the fundamental condition of 'ground' allowing the phenomenon of situation to take place.

=== Situation and knowledge ===
On the epistemological level, this means that for Vesely, the nature of 'ground' allows an understanding of ‘spatial structure’; like a ''hermeneutical key'' granting access to phenomena of spatiality. Contemporary architecture has been particularly keen on challenging the average views on ''ground'' viz. gravity. Although most architecture cannot escape the 'predicament' of gravity, there are numerous examples of play with gravity and the 'visual weight' of architectural mass against gravity, starting from the early twentieth-century [[Constructivist architecture|constructivism]]. Such architectural play shows an impulse towards the emancipation from gravity as a natural source of situation, and looks forward to expose a more fundamental ground of reference and its problematic nature. Architecture is thus setting a clear challenge on everyday experience as they are structured characteristically in terms of up and down, and according to a horizontal ground. The experiment of the 'inverted vision' seems to show exactly that: the touch of ground helps to define the vertical and the relative distances of objects, orientation, and to recognize the [[physiognomy]] of the space. Outside these conditions it seems more or less obvious that the 'grounds' for situation escape our grasp. At the same time, architects are conscious that it is precisely the implicit nature of ground as a structure of references that makes the task of its architectural exploration so difficult.

Moreover, according to Vesely, the notion of 'ground' can never provide us with an absolute knowledge of the whole, but only with a mediated understanding of spatial structure. This means that the task of uncovering the hidden nature of ground becomes, a fortiori, one of looking for a provisional ground that is beyond gravity as a natural source of spatial reference. The first long-term programme dealing with the consequences of the absence of gravity was developed already in 1973 by the [[NASA]] [[Skylab]]. Vesely reports how one of the greatest difficulties encountered by the astronauts is the constant loss of orientation that becomes a general difficulty in recognizing previously known situations. Without gravity, an otherwise familiar compartment would be unrecognizable if not seen from a particular angle. The Sky Lab experience seems to illustrate quite well how the phenomenon of spatial structure and situation comes to be known through a sequence of approximations. Without the right orientation, simple recognition such as finding objects in their right places would become an almost impossible task. Once found the right orientation towards objects, however, the entire spatial frame of the compartment was recognized and so would all objects in their right places and relative positions. In a situation without light or gravity, one of the Sky Lab astronauts also described how a single touch on one of the walls of the space compartment would be sufficient to enact the knowledge of the relative position of the body with respect to all objects (pp.&amp;nbsp;52–54). This seems to be particularly relevant to show how a particular point of visual or tactile reference can provide with orientation; a physiognomic recognition of the space; and be related to the spatial disposition of the whole. These are instances that, according to Vesely, constitute a continuity of spatial reference and an epistemological, provisional ground. As it arises in the continuity of understanding the potential structure of the space, the notion of ground seems to be of a projective nature (p.&amp;nbsp;103).

=== The continuity of reference ===
Vesely seems to confer a projective ability on spatiality that is thus knowable from its own potential to generate a situation. According to Vesely, the continuity of reference to ground exists within a permanent tension with the actual space, a continuity which under certain conditions may be disrupted and even destroyed (pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56). The fact that there are discrepancies between different levels of representation should perhaps be no surprise as it is the case of the above-mentioned examples of reading a map, or orienting oneself in a space under zero gravity. That there is discrepancy between the given representation of a space and the actual space is in fact a common datum of everyday experience. The question is not to be solved, although it may constitute one important point of departure to understand the phenomenon of representation. This is particularly the case of extreme conditions where the phenomenon of 'continuity' is no longer recognizable. In the cases of [[aphasia]] and [[apraxia]], which rank among others of what is generally known as mental blindness, there is a blatant discontinuity between the possibilities of notional understanding and the actual performance of a purposive act or standard articulation of speech. The work and research that has been carried out on mental blindness tends to show that the ability to articulate both speech and purposive actions and gestures is nonetheless affected by the surrounding environment, and is not based upon mental impairment alone. On the contrary, it has become increasingly clear that such conditions do not take place solely as a result of mental functions; neither can they be enacted by the situational structure, as both contribute to the failure and success of treatment (p.&amp;nbsp;57).
	
Vesely brings the argument about these conditions back to the experiments regarding orientation, such as the inverted vision experiment and orientation under zero gravity conditions, and correlates it with the problems experienced with mental blindness. This is because of the fundamental knowledge of spatiality that is at stake that enables a possible representation to be actually effected. As regards spatiality, Vesely presupposes an existing continuity between the possible and the actual spatial configuration, as a mediated structure (p.&amp;nbsp;58). This understanding of representation seems to reverberate [[Husserl]]'s phenomenological treatment of representation, as moving from the horizon of vague, informal representation (''Vorstellung''), through a number of possibilities (''Vergegenwärtigungen''), until it finally reaches actuality (''Repräsentation''). The fact that [[Husserl]] only used the word ''Repräsentation'' to deal with explicit forms of representation, may serve us as an example of how a whole representational process was being kept in the background. Husserl's process of representation shows that our knowledge of spatiality intakes different levels of articulation, which are not always as clearly defined as we would wish. This means that the ground and point of departure of explicit references is not a point of departure towards a growing, cumulative knowledge of situation, but is rather a 'coming back' into a prereflective world of experience. In this sense, representation takes place as a spectrum ranging out of explicit forms of articulation into an implicit background, a concept that seems to be confirmed by later [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of perception. It seems obvious that, because of the nature of this prereflective ground, verbal or visual articulation of it cannot take place in an explicit sense. On the contrary, the phenomenological gaze at this background takes place indirectly (p.&amp;nbsp;69) as a preunderstanding of the world. If this is so, then not only our epistemological ground is constituted as an identity of interpretation of different levels of [[perception]], but also the concept of representation as such is constituted as a movement out of a prereflective background. This is precisely the background against which it becomes possible for an articulated structure to take place and be identified as such (pp.&amp;nbsp;75–77). This also means that the difference between different levels of articulation, namely between a preunderstanding background and a given object is precisely what allows us to see the object and situate it within our world of experience. If we accept Vesely's argument, then the difference that formerly stood as an epistemological barrier now becomes a necessary condition for representation to take place.

=== The latent world of architecture ===
Vesely addresses the preunderstanding of world as a ''latent world'' (p.&amp;nbsp;83), that is potentially articulated and structured, and whose relationship to its visible manifestation is not immediate. The reciprocity between this prearticulated level and its visible articulation dwells within the very ontological difference that has been discussed previously. Such reciprocity is a schematic constituent of phenomena of continuity and metaphoricity, that have been constantly described throughout the primary tradition of Christian humanism in the nature of [[being]] and [[becoming (philosophy)|becoming]]. Vesely thus enters the core of the question of representation in terms of its coming into the level of visibility. In the sequence of Vesely's argument, the subject of visibility becomes then, of itself, problematic in nature as it intakes a background of potential articulation.

According to Vesely, "the horizon of visibility displays a synthesis of the prereflective experience and of the achievements of reflection insofar as they preserve ontological continuity with the visible" (p.&amp;nbsp;85). On the other hand, the rise onto the explicit level of visibility primarily seems to express the problem of representation in terms of what is kept from the prereflective world. This could perhaps be seen as a consequence of the traditional concept of inner representation as relating to an external reality. Vesely challenges this concept of representation, and widens it as a spectrum that ranges from the explicitness of our world down to implicit levels of articulation. Consequently, the term reality is restricted mostly to certain types of representation (e.g. [[virtual reality]]) that view reality as something extrinsic (pp.&amp;nbsp;308–315).
	
Vesely's concept of representation, however, takes place in terms of a communication between a wide range of levels; whereby the question that concerns representation also concerns the [[truth]] of representation, a question that has been amply developed by modern [[hermeneutics]]. In this domain, the visible world conveys a kind of knowledge of the prereflective levels of articulation that also jeopardizes the epistemological status of the visible. As we have seen, contrary to empiricist belief, the visible world by itself does not constitute an epistemological ground (pp.&amp;nbsp;84–86). Instead, our epistemological ground is constituted by features such as orientation, [[physiognomy]], and the relative position of things with regard to one another; and it is from these features that a provisional ground comes to be constituted as regards spatiality. This ground is not a still point of reference. On the contrary, by ground is here meant a source and stream of references. This means that the explicit horizon of the visible, tangible world is the most explicit form of [[:wikt:embody|embodiment]] we have, but such a narrow horizon we can only take as a point of departure if we want to understand the rest of our world that is largely beyond visibility. This also means that the visible holds a very important part as a symbolic representation of our world, enabling us to see and imagine beyond the visible.

Finally, this means that we construe our knowledge of 'world' largely on the basis of invisible, implicit references which are only symbolically re-enacted by the visible realm. The level of visual representation may perhaps be compared to the level of more explicit verbal articulation as regards the implicit, preverbal domain of knowledge. Just as visual representation, verbal articulation has the power to emancipate from the given world, and the freedom to convey any meaning. This is a power bestowed upon representation, allowing it to withdraw from its original symbolic domain, thus establishing a tension between the instrumental nature of representation and its larger symbolic field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8759">'''Developmental noise''' is a concept within [[developmental biology]] in which the [[phenotype]] varies between individuals even though both the [[genotype]]s and the [[environmental factor]]s are the same for all of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Developmental Noise, Phenotypic Plasticity, and Allozyme Heterozygosity in Daphnia |vauthors=Yampolsky LY, Scheiner SR | journal=Evolution |volume=48| year=1994 |pages=1715–22 |doi=10.2307/2410259 |issue=5 |jstor=2410259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributing factors include stochastic gene expression and other sources of [[cellular noise]].&lt;ref name="pmid16760970"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horikawa K, Ishimatsu K, Yoshimoto E, Kondo S, Takeda H |title=Noise-resistant and synchronized oscillation of the segmentation clock |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7094 |pages=719–23 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16760970 |doi=10.1038/nature04861 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Although organisms within a species share very similar genes, similar environments and similar developmental history, each individual organism can develop differences due to noise in [[Cell signaling|signaling and signal interpretation]]. This developmental noise may help individuals gain the ability to adapt to the environment and contribute to their unique patterns of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raser |first=J. M. |last2=O'Shea |first2=E. K. |title=Noise in gene expression: origins, consequences, and control |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=309 |issue=5743 |pages=2010–2013 |year=2005 |doi=10.1126/science.1105891 |pmid=16179466 |pmc=1360161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human fingerprints provide a well-known example; the fingerprints differ even between genetically identical human twins.

==Use of noise in biology==
Developmental noise may help individuals gain the ability to adapt to the environment. [[Systems biology|Biological systems]] display both variation and robustness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barkai |first=N. |last2=Shilo |first2=B. Z. |title=Variability and robustness in biomolecular systems |journal=Mol Cell |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=755–760 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2007.11.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural variation within a population is in large part genetically determined, but variation due to noise may contribute to a rapid response by an individual to changes in the environment. This variation can have an evolutionary tuning effect that contributes to the optimal fitness of a population. In support of this idea, it has been shown that bacteria can switch [[stochastic]]ally into a "persistent" state which has slow growth coupled with an ability to survive antibiotic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kussell |first=E. |last2=Kishony |first2=R. |last3=Balaban |first3=N. Q. |last4=Leibler |first4=S. |title=Bacterial persistence: a model of survival in changing environments |journal=Genetics |volume=169 |issue= |pages=1807–1814 |year=2005 |doi=10.1534/genetics.104.035352 |pmid=15687275 |pmc=1449587}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, it has been shown that most of the noisy proteins were associated with the stress response. When proteins are expressed in small quantities, the expression of more noisy proteins will be more influenced by noises which come from the environmental context. Types of noises include extrinsic noise which is the variation in cell-to-cell expression level of protein, and intrinsic noise which is the variation of the inherent stochastic nature of protein expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman-McQuiston |first=E. |title=The Effect of Noisy Protein Expression on E. coli/Phage Dynamics |year=2007 |url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/9472/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, noisy genes are associated with a distinct promoter architecture, including the prevalence of [[TATA box]]es, consistent with the theoretical predictions that noise is greatly inﬂuenced by the logic of the transcriptional process itself and, in particular, the transition from closed to open chromatin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blake |first=W. J. |title=Phenotypic consequences of promoter-mediated transcriptional noise |journal=Mol Cell |volume=24 |issue= |pages=853–865 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2006.11.003 |display-authors=etal |pmid=17189188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developmental noise can contribute to unique patterns of development in each individual as well. During development of a complex organ, variability in gene expression may be required to contribute to differentiation of multiple cell types from cells that have equivalent potential. For example, the patterning of the adult fly eye relies on multiple alternative choices of differentiation pathways within an apparently homogeneous field of cells. The facets ([[ommatidia]]) in fly eyes occur as two types, designated pale and yellow, as defined by the particular types of rhodopsin photopigments expressed in the two inner photoreceptor cells.&lt;ref name="Wernet"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wernet |first=M. F. |title=Stochastic spineless expression creates the retinal mosaic for colour vision |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=440 |issue=7081 |pages=174–180 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/nature04615 |display-authors=etal |pmid=16525464 |pmc=3826883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forde"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forde |first=B.

The final pattern of ommatidia is determined by stochastic variation in expression of this single [[transcription factor]] Spineless.&lt;ref name="Wernet" /&gt;

==Developmental noise in plants==
The majority of study on developmental noise has focused on animals, but there are also examples from plants. In one early study, Roy made thousands of observations on petal numbers as well as on leaf tooth numbers. He observed a high degree of variability in both traits. After analyzing his data, he could not conclude that the variability was caused by environmental effect. Another example of noise in plants is lateral root behavior. People found that the growth of [[lateral root]]s is unpredictable in genetically identical plants which grow in the same environment. One more example of seed germination may illustrate the benefit of developmental noise in plants. Stochasticity in the timing of germination ensures that at least a fraction of the progeny will survive to reproduce.&lt;ref name="Forde" /&gt;

==Noise and robustness==
Though stochastic variations in cell behaviors may be beneficial, most biological systems need to maintain a reliable output without unpredictable variations. This ability to buffer variations generated by molecular noise, [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetics|genetic polymorphism]], or environmental
ﬂuctuations is termed robustness.

For example, in the development of the repeating blocks of [[somite]]s in the mesoderm of vertebrate animals, even though the biological system may be subject to a noisy environment, the segmentation clock maintains periodic gene expression through coupled oscillators, in which synchronous oscillation of neighbors is maintained through mutual coupling. This mechanism enables embryos to maintain a constant segregation of somites, despite the noise imposed by the high level mitosis required for continued growth.&lt;ref name="Ishimatsu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ishimatsu |first=K. |last2=Horikawa |first2=K. |last3=Takeda |first3=H. |title=Coupling cellular oscillators: a mechanism that maintains synchrony against developmental noise in the segmentation clock |journal=Dev Dyn |volume=236 |issue=6 |pages=1416–1421 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.21139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further study==
The sources, consequences, and control of noise are major questions in study of developmental noise. Recent studies suggest that this noise has multiple sources, including the stochastic or inherently random nature of the biochemical reactions of gene expression. But the detailed mechanisms are still unclear and the contributions of factors such as [[microRNA]]s, whose existence was first discovered in the 1990s, remain unclear. For example, one recent study showed that microRNAs can serve different roles, from using noise to throw a developmental switch to buffering the consequences of noise in order to confer robustness to environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name="Ishimatsu" /&gt; Thus, much work remains to be done in understanding the significance, control and mechanisms of developmental noise.

'''Edward Spencer Beesly''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|z|l|i}}; 1831–1915) was an English [[Positivism|positivist]] and historian.

==Life==
He was born on 23 January 1831 in [[Feckenham|Feckenham, Worcestershire]], the eldest son of the Rev. James Beesly and his wife, Mary Fitzgerald, of Queen's county, Ireland. After reading Latin and Greek with his father, in the autumn of 1846 he was sent to [[King William's College]] on the Isle of Man, an evangelical establishment whose inadequate instruction and low moral tone were later depicted in ''[[Eric, or, Little by Little]]'', by his school friend [[Frederic Farrar|F. W. Farrar]].

In 1849 Beesly entered [[Wadham College, Oxford]], another evangelical stronghold. He held two exhibitions and a Bible clerkship. His flair for quoting scripture yielded to radical rhetoric under the influence of his tutor [[Richard Congreve]], a covert disciple of Auguste [[Comtism|Comte]]'s positivism. Along with his Wadham friends [[Frederic Harrison]] and John Henry Bridges, Beesly actively engaged in the debates of the Oxford Union and became recognised as a Comtist, though his adhesion to the French philosophy was still tenuous.

Beesly received his BA in 1854 and proceeded MA in 1857. After failing to secure a first class (he obtained seconds in classical moderations and literae humaniores) or a fellowship, he became an assistant master at [[Marlborough College]]. His brother Augustus Henry, a historian and classical scholar, also taught at the school. Beesly left for London in 1859 to serve as principal of University Hall, a student residence in Gordon Square serving [[University College, London|University College]]. The next year he was appointed professor of history there and professor of Latin at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]] for women, with a combined salary of £300. He also had a private income. His tall, willowy figure became a familiar sight in the [[Reform Club]] and London drawing-rooms, including that of [[George Eliot]] and [[George Henry Lewes]], whose [[Fortnightly Review]] welcomed Beesly's articles.

Beesly joined Congreve and Harrison, both now in London, in supporting the struggle of the workers in the building trades for shorter hours. He also attacked the economic theories used by critics of the 'new model' trade unions of the 1860s. The notoriety he gained culminated in 1867, when he declared in the aftermath of the 'Sheffield outrages' that a trade union murder was no worse than any other: he almost lost his post at University Hall and [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] dubbed him Dr Beastly. His radical agenda included promoting international solidarity among working-class leaders. He helped organise the most important pro-Union demonstration in England during the American Civil War, and he chaired the historic meeting (28 September 1864) advocating co-operation between English and French workers in support of Polish nationalism, which led to the formation of the [[International Workingmen's Association|International Working Men's Association]] (the First International), soon dominated by his friend [[Karl Marx]].

Foreign affairs were always a passion of Beesly's. For International Policy, a positivist volume published in 1866, he wrote on British sea power, asserting a connection between Protestantism and commercial immorality. A critic of imperialism, he was a member of the committee founded in 1866 to prosecute Edward Eyre, governor of Jamaica [see Jamaica committee]. Beesly and other positivists incurred hostility for advocating intervention on the side of France in the Franco-Prussian War, and for defending the Paris commune. Their republican views found expression not only in the press but also at the positivist centre in Chapel Street (now Rugby Street) that they opened in 1870 under Congreve's direction. There they introduced sacraments of the Religion of Humanity and published a co-operative translation of Comte's Positive Polity. When Congreve repudiated their Paris co-religionists in 1878, Beesly, Harrison, Bridges, and others formed their own positivist society, with Beesly as president, and opened a rival centre, Newton Hall, in a courtyard off Fleet Street. Beesly headed its political discussion group, which produced occasional papers. Retirement from University College in 1893 (he had left Bedford College in 1889) enabled him to found and edit the Positivist Review.

In 1881, Beesly attended the early meetings of the [[Social Democratic Federation|Democratic Federation]], but he was soon marginalised, and returned to the Liberal Party by the middle of the decade.&lt;ref name="breuilly"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Breuilly |first1=John |last2=Niedhart |first2=Gottfried |last3=Taylor |first3=Antony |title=The Era of the Reform League: English Labour and Radical Politics 1857&amp;ndash;1872 |date=1995 |publisher=J &amp; J Verlag |location=Mannheim |page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 Beesly married Emily, youngest daughter of Sir Charles John Crompton, justice of the queen's bench, and his wife, Caroline. The Beeslys lived in University Hall until 1882, when they moved to Finsbury Park. Mrs Beesly was not a positivist—as were her brothers Albert and Henry Crompton—but she shared some of her husband's political and historical interests. He unsuccessfully stood for parliament as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] at [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] in November 1885 and at Marylebone in July 1886. Emily Beesly became president of the women's liberal association of Paddington after their move to Warrington Crescent in 1886. Both advocated Irish home rule, he in hard-hitting articles, she in new lyrics for 'The Wearing of the Green'. In 1878 he published Catiline, Clodius, and Tiberius, and she brought out her Stories from the History of Rome, written for their four sons. She died in 1889, aged forty-nine.

Beesly's later publications included seventy-four biographical entries on military and political figures for the positivists' New Calendar of Great Men, and Queen Elizabeth, both of which appeared in 1892. In 1901 he retired to 21 West Hill, St Leonards, Sussex, where he published translations of Comte and continued to write for the Positivist Review. He died at home on 7 July 1915 and was buried in Paddington cemetery. He left a name still honoured by labour historians.

== Friends ==

[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|156px|thumb|right|Beesly's friend Karl Marx]]

Beesly was not only friendly with Marx, but was well acquainted with his circle. He knew Lafargue, he got to know Engels, and there were mutual acquaintances, such as Eugene Oswald. Among workmen, he was not only the friend of [[George Odger]], [[Robert Applegarth]] and Lucraft, but was on close terms with such working-class confidants of Marx as Jung and Eccarius, and to a lesser extent with Dupont. In the sixties he was a familiar figure, not only in the offices of the Carpenters and Joiners, the [[London Trades Council]] or ''[[The Bee-Hive (journal)|The Bee-Hive]]'', but was also at home in the "Golden Ball" where the most radical of London's workmen talked with continental revolutionaries over a clay pipe and a pot of beer. Here one could get the flavour of European proletarian politics: that other “World of Labour” in whose ideals Beesly was as deeply interested as he was in those of English trades unionism. Indeed, for many years he expressed his desire for the amalgamation of trade unionism – with its implicit recognition of the priority of social questions—, and proletarian republicanism – with its generous enthusiasm and its larger view.

== Letter from Marx ==

'''Auction lot description of Beesly's copy of Das Kapital:''' This is an excellent association copy, inscribed to Karl Marx’s friend Professor Edward Spencer Beesly (1831–1915), positivist of the Auguste Comte school of thought, historian, and one of the founding editors of the Fortnightly Review.
In 1868, when Marx &amp; Engels were trying to develop international momentum for the economic philosophy contained in this work, they contacted the Fortnightly Review via Beesly to see if it would be interested in publishing a critique of Das Kapital; at the time Marx wrote to Engels: “Prof. Beesly, who is one of the triumvirate which secretly runs this rag, has… declared, he is ‘morally certain’ (it depends on him!) a criticism would be accepted” [8 January 1868].
An eventual review was passed on to the then chief editor John Morley by Beesly, but Morley apparently found the piece unreadable and would not allow publication, even after Beesly had suggested Marx could try to make the article less dry and more popularist in tone. Beesly subsequently suggested Marx &amp; Engels contact The Westminster Review, but nothing seems to have come of this either.
The further inscription, possibly by Beesly, reads "Died 14 March 1883", the date of Marx's death.  '''Sold for £115,000, 27 May 2010'''

'''Francis Dominic Bencini''' (1664–1744) was a minor Maltese philosopher who specialised in apologetics.

==Life==
Benici began his studies in [[Malta]], and went on to become a diocesan priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then studied theology in Rome, from where he obtained his graduate colours.

Thereafter, he immediately began teaching dogmatic theology at the ''[[Collegio Urbano]]'', in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. While there, he was also installed as librarian of ''Propaganda Fide'', and chosen as secretary to the pontifical councils. He dedicated much of his intellectual energies to the anti-reformist polemic which was in full swing during his times.

After many years working hard in [[Rome]], Bencini expected to be awarded for his efforts. However, no official recognition was forthcoming, and this left him quite embittered. Sick of waiting, he thus left [[Rome]] and went to [[Turin]], in northern [[Italy]]. There, at least, he was made professor at the [[University of Turin]]. He mainly taught theology and Holy Scripture. He seems to have been glad at his new place of adoption. For, from his personal financial resources, he paid for the establishment of a Chair of [[Apologetics]], and also established a Catholic school of [[catechism]].

Bencini may have died in [[Turin]]. No portrait of him is known to exist.

==Publications==
[[File:Bencini, Francis Dominic.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of Bencini’s ''Philosophia Tabulis Exposita (1703)'']]

===Main work===
All of Bencini’s manuscripts remain in the holdings of the [[University of Turin]]. Bencini himself published some of his works during his lifetime, otherwise no other manuscripts have ever been published. Most of these works concern themes related to Christian, particularly Catholic [[apologetics]].

Of those published, his '''''Philosophia Tabulis Exposita''''' (1703), from a philosophical point of view, is of special interest.&lt;ref name="Montebello_II_91"&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a work in Latin, and published in [[Rome]]. It carries the sub-title: ''Varia antiquorum, recentiorumque Philosophorum Placita exhibens, ac perpetius commentarijs illustrata'' (Illustrations of various known philosophies of ancient and recent times, with each illustration commented).

The book is dedicated to an adolescent boy called [[Alessandro Albani]], the nephew of [[Pope Clement XI]] Albani. What follows is a textual format explanation of the work, some general information about the illustrations, the commemorative reason for publishing the work, and the method used for the order of the illustrations.

The predominate book contents are the illustrations, divided into three sections. The first deals with philosophy in general; the second with [[dialectics]]; the third with [[logic]]. Six illustrations are presented in the first section, seven in the second, and nine in the third. In a systematic order, each illustration is described by an extensive description. The parts dealing with [[dialectics]] and [[logic]] are basically based on [[Aristotle]]. The first section is predominantly concerns classical Greek philosophy.

===Other works===
Other published works by Bencini, though not of a philosophical theme, are ''Præfatio dicta ante disputationem thesium'' (Preface as an Afterword of a Disputation of Theses; 1687) and ''Il Concilio di Calcedonia'' (The [[Council of Chalcedon]]; 1715).&lt;ref name="Montebello_II_91"/&gt; Both deal with apologetical themes, particularly in reference to reformation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17871">'''Genetic purging''' is the reduction of the frequency of a deleterious [[allele]], caused by an increased efficiency of natural selection prompted by [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia-Dorado |first1=A. |title=On the consequences of ignoring purging on genetic recommendations of MVP rules |journal=Heredity |date=15 April 2015 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2015.28 |volume=115 |pages=185–187|pmc=4814235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purging occurs because many deleterious alleles only express all their harmful effect when [[homozygous]], present in two copies. During inbreeding, as related individuals mate, they produce offspring that are more likely to be homozygous. Deleterious alleles appear more often, making individuals less fit genetically, i.e. they pass fewer copies of their genes to future generations. Put another way, [[natural selection]] purges the deleterious alleles.

Purging reduces both the overall number of recessive deleterious alleles and the decline of mean fitness caused by inbreeding (the [[inbreeding depression]] for fitness).

The term "purge" is sometimes used for selection against deleterious alleles in a general way. It would avoid ambiguity to use "[[purifying selection]]" in that general context, and to reserve purging to its more strict meaning defined above.

== The mechanism ==

Deleterious alleles segregating in populations of [[diploid]] organisms have a remarkable trend to be, at least, partially recessive. This means that, when they occur in homozygosis (double copies), they reduce [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] by more than twice than when they occur in heterozygosis (single copy). In other words, part of their potential deleterious effect is hidden in heterozygosis but expressed in homozygosis, so that selection is more efficient against them when they occur in homozygosis. Since inbreeding increases the probability of being homozygous, it increases the fraction of the potential deleterious effect that is expressed and, therefore, exposed to selection. This causes some increase in the selective pressure against (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, which is known as purging. Of course, it also causes some reduction in fitness, which is known as [[inbreeding depression]].

Purging can reduce the average frequency of deleterious alleles across the genome below the value expected in a non-inbred population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glémin|first=S|year=2003|title=How are deleterious mutations purged? Drift versus nonrandom mating|journal=Evolution|volume=57|pages=2678–2687|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb01512.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this reduction usually does not compensate for all the negative effects of inbreeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedrick|first1=P. W.|first2=S. T.|last2=Kalinowski|year=2000|title=Inbreeding depression in conservation biology|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=31|pages=139–162|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.139}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has several beneficial consequences for fitness. A consequence is the reduction of the so-called inbreeding load. This means that, after purging, further inbreeding is expected to be less harmful. But the most immediate consequence is the reduction of the actual inbreeding depression of fitness: due to purging, mean fitness declines less than would be expected just from inbreeding and, after some initial decline, it can even rebound up to almost its value before inbreeding.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite journal|last=García-Dorado|first=A|year=2012|title=Understanding and predicting the fitness decline of shrunk populations: inbreeding, purging, mutation and standard selection|journal=Genetics|volume=190|pages=1461–1476|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.135541|pmid=22298709|pmc=3316656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The joint effect of inbreeding and purging on fitness ==

Accounting for purging when predicting inbreeding depression is important in evolutionary genetics, because the fitness decline caused by inbreeding can be determinant in the evolution of [[diploidy]], sexual reproduction and other main biological features. It is also important in animal breeding and, of course, in [[conservation genetics]], because inbreeding depression may be a relevant factor determining the extinction risk of endangered populations, and because conservation programs can allow some breeding handling in order to control inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankham|first=R|year=2005|title=Genetics and extinction|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=126|pages=131–140|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, Due to purging, inbreeding depression is not proportional to the standard measure of inbreeding (Wright's inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}), since this measure only applies to [[Neutral evolution|neutral]] alleles. Instead, fitness decline is proportional to "purged inbreeding" {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, which gives the probability of being homozygous for deleterious alleles due to inbreeding, taking into account how they are being purged.

Purging reduces inbreeding depression in two ways: first, it slows its progress; second, it reduces the overall inbreeding depression expected in the long term. The slower the progress of inbreeding, the more efficient is purging.

=== A more detailed explanation ===

In the absence of natural selection, mean fitness would be expected to decline exponentially as inbreeding increases, where inbreeding is measured using Wright's inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crow|first1=J.F.|first2=M.|last2=Kimura|year=1970|title=An Introduction to Population Genetics Theory|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the reason why decline is exponential on {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} instead of linear is just that fitness is usually considered a multiplicative trait). The rate at which fitness declines as {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} increases (the inbreeding depression rate ''δ'') depends on the frequencies and deleterious effects of the alleles present in the population before inbreeding.

The above coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} is the standard measure of inbreeding, and gives the probability that, at any given neutral locus, an individual has inherited two copies of a same gene of a common ancestor (i.e. the probability of being homozygous "by descent"). In simple conditions, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} can be easily computed in terms of population size or of genealogical information. {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} is often denoted using lowercase ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;f&lt;/VAR&gt;}}), but should not be confused with the coancestry coefficient.

However, the above prediction for the fitness decline rarely applies, since it was derived assuming no selection, and fitness is precisely the target trait of [[natural selection]]. Thus, Wright's inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} for neutral loci does not apply to deleterious alleles, unless inbreeding increases so fast that the change in gene frequency is governed just by random sampling (i.e., by [[genetic drift]]).

Therefore, the decline of fitness should be predicted using, instead of the standard inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, a "purged inbreeding coefficient" ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}}) that gives the probability of being homozygous by descent for (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, taking into account how their frequency is reduced by purging.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; Due to purging, fitness declines at the same rate {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/var&gt;}} than in the absence of selection, but as a function of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} instead of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.
 
This purged inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} can also be computed, to a good approximation, using simple expressions in terms of the population size or of the genealogy of individuals (see BOX 1). However this requires some information on the magnitude of the deleterious effects that are hidden in the heterozygous condition but become expressed in homozygosis. The larger this magnitude, denoted purging coefficient ''d'', the more efficient is purging.

An interesting property of purging is that, during inbreeding, while {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} increases approaching a final value {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1}}, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} can approach a much smaller final value. Hence, it is not just that purging slows the fitness decline, but also that it reduces the overall fitness loss produced by inbreeding in the long term. This is illustrated in BOX 2 for the extreme case of inbreeding depression caused by recessive lethals, which are alleles that cause death before reproduction but only when they occur in homozygosis. Purging is less effective against mildly deleterious alleles than against lethal ones but, in general, the slower is the increase of inbreeding {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, the smaller becomes the final value of the purged inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} and, therefore, the final reduction in fitness. This implies that, if inbreeding progresses slowly enough, no relevant inbreeding depression is expected in the long term. This results in the fitness of a small population, that has been a small population for a long time, can be the same as a large population with more genetic diversity. In conservation genetics, it would be very useful to ascertain the maximum rate of increase of inbreeding that allows for such efficient purging.

== Examples ==

=== Predictive equations when inbreeding is due to small population size ===
Consider a large non-inbred population with mean fitness {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;W&lt;/VAR&gt;}}. Then, the size of the population reduces to a new smaller value {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;N&lt;/VAR&gt;}} (in fact, the [[effective population size]] should be used here), leading to a progressive increase of inbreeding.

Then inbreeding depression occurs at a rate {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, due to (partially) recessive deleterious alleles that were present at low frequencies at different loci. This means that, in the absence of selection, the expected value for mean fitness after {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}} generations of inbreeding, would be:

&lt;math&gt;W_t = W e^{-\delta F_t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_t&lt;/math&gt; is the population mean for Wright's inbreeding coefficient after {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}} generations of inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, since selection operates upon fitness, mean fitness should be predicted taking into acco naveenraj unt both inbreeding and purging, as

&lt;math&gt;W_t = W e^{-\delta g_t}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above equation, &lt;math&gt;g_t&lt;/math&gt; is the average "purged inbreeding coefficient" after {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}} generations of inbreeding.&lt;ref name="Garcia" /&gt; It depends upon the "purging coefficient" {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;d&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, which represents the deleterious effects that are hidden in heterozygosis but exposed in homozygosis.

The average "purged inbreeding coefficient" can be approximated using the recurrent expression

&lt;math&gt;g_t = \left [ \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{2N} \right ) g_{t-1} + \frac{1}{2N} \right ] \left [ 1 - 2dF_{t-1} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

There are also predictive equations to be used with genealogical information.

=== The example of inbreeding depression due to recessive lethals ===
[[File:Fitness decline from lethals vs generations of inbreeding.tif|thumb|200px|Average population fitness ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;W&lt;/VAR&gt;}}) against number of generations ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}}) of maintenance with population size N=10 when, in the original population, individuals carried on the average one rare recessive lethal. Evolution of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;W&lt;/VAR&gt;}} expected only from inbreeding (red line) or from inbreeding and purging (blue line).]]
As an example of genetic purging, consider a large population where there are recessive lethal alleles segregating at very low frequency in many loci, so that each individual carries on the average one of these alleles. Although about 63% of the individuals carry at least one of these lethal alleles, almost none carry two copies of the same lethal. Therefore, since lethals are considered completely recessive (i.e., they are harmless in heterozygosis), they cause almost no deaths. Now assume that population size reduces to a small value (say ''N''=10), and remains that small for many generations. As inbreeding increases, the probability of being homozygous for one (or more) of these lethal alleles also increases, causing fitness to decline. However, as those lethals begin to occur in homozygosis, natural selection begins purging them. The figure to the right gives the expected decline of fitness against the number of generations, taking into account just the increase in inbreeding {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;}} (red line), or both inbreeding and purging (blue line, computed using the purged inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;}}). This example shows that purging can be very efficient preventing inbreeding depression. However, for non-lethal deleterious alleles, the efficiency of purging would be smaller, and it can require larger populations to overcome genetic drift.

=== Genome renewal ===
The yeast [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] and [[Saccharomyces paradoxus]] have a life cycle that alternates between long periods of [[asexual reproduction]] as a diploid, ending in [[meiosis]] that is usually immediately followed [[selfing]], with only rare [[outcrossing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsai|first1=I. J.|last2=Bensasson|first2=D.|last3=Burt|first3=A.|last4=Koufopanou|first4=V.|title=Population genomics of the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus: Quantifying the life cycle|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=14 March 2008|volume=105|issue=12|pages=4957–4962|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707314105|pmid=18344325|pmc=2290798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recessive deleterious mutations accumulate during the diploid expansion phase, and are purged during selfing: this purging has been termed "genome renewal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mortimer|first1=Robert K.|last2=Romano|first2=Patrizia|last3=Suzzi|first3=Giovanna|last4=Polsinelli|first4=Mario|title=Genome renewal: A new phenomenon revealed from a genetic study of 43 strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae derived from natural fermentation of grape musts|journal=Yeast|date=December 1994|volume=10|issue=12|pages=1543–1552|doi=10.1002/yea.320101203|pmid=7725789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masel|first1=Joanna |author1link=Joanna Masel|last2=Lyttle|first2=David N.|title=The consequences of rare sexual reproduction by means of selfing in an otherwise clonally reproducing species|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=December 2011|volume=80|issue=4|pages=317–322|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2011.08.004|pmid=21888925|pmc=3218209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence and problems ==
When a previously stable population undergoes inbreeding, if nothing else changes, natural selection should consist mainly of purging. The joint consequences of inbreeding and purging on fitness vary depending on many factors: the previous history of the population, the rate of increase of inbreeding, the harshness of the environment or of the competitive conditions, etc. The effects of purging were first noted by Darwin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=C. R.|authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=1876|title=The effects of cross and selffertilisation in the vegetable kingdom|location=London|publisher=John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; in plants, and have been detected in laboratory experiments and in vertebrate populations undergoing inbreeding in zoos or in the wild, as well as in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crnokrak|first1=P.|last2=Barrett|first2=S. C. H.|year=2002|title=Purging the genetic load: a review of the experimental evidence|journal=Evolution|volume=56|pages=2347–2358|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00160.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of purging is often obscured by many factors, but there is consistent evidence that, in agreement with the predictions explained above, slow inbreeding results in more efficient purging, so that a given inbreeding F leads to less threat to population viability if it has been produced more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leberg|first1=P. L.|last2=Firmin|first2=B. D.|year=2008|title=Role of inbreeding depression and purging in captive breeding and restoration programmes|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=17|pages=334–343|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2007.03433.x|pmid=18173505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in practical situations, the genetic change in fitness also depends on many other factors, besides inbreeding and purging. For example, adaptation to changing environmental conditions often causes relevant genetic changes during inbreeding. Furthermore, if inbreeding is due to a reduction in population size, selection against new deleterious [[mutation]]s can become less efficient, and this can induce additional fitness decline in the medium-long term.

In addition, part of the inbreeding depression could not be due to deleterious alleles, but to an intrinsic advantage of being heterozygous compared to being homozygous for any available allele, which is known as overdominance. Inbreeding depression caused by overdominance cannot be purged, but seems to be a minor cause of overall inbreeding depression, although its actual importance is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crow|first=JF|year=2008|title=Mid-century controversies in population genetics|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=42|pages=1–16|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.42.110807.091612|pmid=18652542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, predicting the actual evolution of fitness during inbreeding is highly elusive. However, the component of fitness decline expected from inbreeding and purging on deleterious alleles could be predicted using {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;}}.

'''Goran Švob''' ({{IPA-sh|ɡoran ʃʋob|pron}}; 29 May 1947 – 18 April 2013) was a Croatian [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[logic]]ian, and author. He was an associate professor at the Department of Philosophy of [[University of Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]], [[University of Zagreb]] where he taught logic and the [[philosophy of language]], being employed there since 1975.

Švob has written two books and published numerous scientific papers in the academic field of [[logic]]. He was greatly influenced by the [[analytic philosophy]] and particularly by the philosophers [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

==Education and academic career==
Švob was born on 29 May 1947 in [[Zagreb]], then part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. There he finished his primary school education and graduated from [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. He then enrolled at the [[University of Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]] of the [[University of Zagreb]] where he got his [[Master of Arts]] in [[philosophy]] and [[English language]] in 1971. The same year he managed to get employed at the Department of Philosophy of the same faculty.

During the academic year 1973–1974 Švob spent six months as a research fellow at the [[University of Oxford]]. He also had shorter visits at the universities in [[Austria]], [[West Germany]], [[Great Britain]], [[Japan]], and [[China]]. In 1988 he got his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in philosophy at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the following year he was selected to the position of an assistant professor, and was further promoted to the position of associate professor in 2001. He has been teaching logic and philosophy of language there since 1975. He was also a guest lecturer at the [[University of Vienna]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], [[Peking University]], [[Hokkaido University]], [[University of Tokyo]], and [[Kyoto University]].

Švob was the leader of scientific research project ''Logic, Universal Language and the Philosophy of Language'' ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Logika, univerzalni jezik i filozofija jezika'') of the [[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia]].&lt;ref name=biografija/&gt;

==Published work==
Švob published scientific papers in leading philosophical journals, in particular the journal of [[Praxis School]], ''Filozofska istraživanja'', ''SOL'', and, most notably, ''Acta Analytica''. His first book, titled ''Frege: Pojmovno pismo'' (English: ''Frege: Conceptual Notation''), was published in 1992.&lt;ref name=biografija/&gt;

''Od slike do igre'' (English: ''From Image to Game'') was a second book written by Švob, published in 2009. The book is consolidated of articles which differ by subject and time when they were written, though they all mainly focus on the work of three philosophers: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. The focal point of the book, however, is the shift in Wittgenstein's philosophy of language, or the transition from the early to late Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profil.hr/knjiga/od-slike-do-igre/31426/ |title=Goran Švob: Od slike do igre |accessdate=18 December 2011 |publisher=Profil.hr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605144850/http://www.profil.hr/knjiga/od-slike-do-igre/31426/ |archivedate=5 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, the [[Anglican Communion]] has struggled with controversy regarding [[homosexuality]] in the church. In 1998, the 13th [[Lambeth Conference]] of Anglican bishops passed a resolution stating that "homosexual acts" are "incompatible with [[Scripture]]". However, this is not legally binding. "Like all Lambeth Conference resolutions, it is not legally binding on all provinces of the Communion, including the Church of England, though it commends an essential and persuasive view of the attitude of the Communion."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2016/11/secretary-general-responds-to-gafcon-uk.aspx|title=Church of England News: Secretary General responds to GAFCON UK|work=Church of England News|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Anglican national churches in [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|South Africa]], [[Church of South India|South India]], [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia|New Zealand]] and [[Anglican Church of Canada|Canada]] have taken steps toward approving and celebrating same-sex relationships amid strong resistance among other national churches within the 80 million-member global body.

In 2002, the [[Anglican Diocese of New Westminster|Diocese of New Westminster]], in the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], permitted the [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessing of same-sex unions]].

In the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States]], [[Gene Robinson]] was elected and consecrated [[Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire|Bishop of New Hampshire]], becoming the first openly [[gay bishops|gay bishop]] in the Anglican Communion and in [[Apostolic succession|apostolic]] [[Christianity]]. This was highly controversial and led several hundred bishops to [[boycott]] the 2008 Lambeth Conference. As an alternative to Lambeth, many of these bishops attended the [[Global Anglican Futures Conference]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="Brittain/McKinnon1-3"&gt;Christopher Craig Brittain and Andrew McKinnon, "[http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3055/1/Anglican_Communion_Conflict_revision_01102010.pdf Homosexuality and the Construction of 'Anglican Orthodoxy': The Symbolic Politics of the Anglican Communion]," ''Sociology of Religion'' (2011), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, other Anglican provinces, including the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], permitted the ordination of gay clergy and others, such as the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church in the USA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/17/AR2009071702943.html|title=New Episcopal Measures on Gay Bishops, Same-Sex Unions May Cause Further Rift|work=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; permitted [[blessing of same-sex unions]] as well.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The BBC, in 2009, reported that many clergy in the Church of England "already bless same-sex couples on an unofficial basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian attitudes to same-sex marriage|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/samesexmarriage.shtml|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many provinces, primarily from the [[Global South (Anglican)|Global South]] and representing about half of the 80 million active Anglicans worldwide, have responded to these theological disputes by declaring a state of [[Full communion|impaired communion]] with their Western counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tablet'', 26 July 2003,[http://www.thetablet.co.uk/cgi-bin/citw.cgi/past-00153 Row over homosexuality splits Anglican Communion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111233908/http://thetablet.co.uk/cgi-bin/citw.cgi/past-00153 |date=11 November 2005 }}.

Since 2000, some conservative Global South provinces have appointed missionary bishops to the United States and Canada to provide pastoral oversight to disaffected Anglicans. This process, known as [[Anglican realignment]], is considered by the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church USA]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] to be an illegitimate incursion into their territories; however, conservative Anglicans argued that the incursions were necessary because of the failure of these churches to uphold orthodox teaching with regard to [[human sexuality]].&lt;ref name="Brittain/McKinnon1-3"/&gt;

==Summary of issues==
{{Main|Anglican doctrine}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
There is a wide range of beliefs within the [[Anglican Communion]] regarding homosexuality. The majority of followers believe that heterosexuality or [[celibacy]] is required of Christians, but believe in tolerance towards others. This differs from secular society in most western democracies, which considers homosexuality to be a normal human variation, and affirms this in law. Some of the more specific issues under study within member churches and dioceses are:
* Same-sex attracted members of the church or communion
** May they exist?
*** Must they denounce their [[sexual orientation]] and strive to become [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]?
*** Must they renounce [[same-sex relationships]] in order to be considered members in good standing?
** Must they be [[celibate]]?
** Should same-sex unions of [[LGBT]] members be blessed?
** Should same-sex couples be allowed a religious marriage ceremony?
* Same-sex attracted clergy
** May they exist?
** May they be openly authentic regarding their sexual orientation?
*** To what extent may they be "out" (e.g. only to their bishop, partner, spouse, or family, or to the wider public)
*** May they openly have a partner or spouse?
** Must they be celibate?
** May any of these individuals (those who are celibate and those who are non-celibate) be bishops?
[[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] churches are diverse in their views, from churches which do not accept any [[LGBT]] members, to churches which are happy to have openly same-sex, partnered or [[Marriage|married]], non-celibate bishops. The nature of the [[Anglican Communion]] is such that not all [[Parish church|churches]] or [[diocese]]s must agree on all issues in order to share a common [[faith]] and [[baptism]]. Part of the controversy concerns how much and what sort of disagreement over these issues may exist while still calling it a "common faith."

* The bishops of the Anglican Communion in 1998 upheld the traditional [[Christian]] teaching that [[marriage]] is between a man and a woman and that those who are not called to marriage so defined should remain celibate. A resolution was passed stating that "homosexual acts" are "incompatible with [[Scripture]]" by a vote of 526–70;&lt;ref&gt;David Skidmore, 7 August 1998, [http://www.lambethconference.org/1998/news/lc098.cfm Lambeth Conference 1998 Archives] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728181157/http://www.lambethconference.org/1998/news/lc098.cfm |date=28 July 2012 }}. Retrieved 12 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; however, it also contained a statement which "calls on all our people to minister pastorally and sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation and to condemn irrational fear of homosexuals, violence within marriage and any trivialisation and commercialisation of sex," and noted importantly: "We commit ourselves to listen to the experience of homosexual persons and we wish to assure them that they are loved by God and that all baptised, believing and faithful persons, regardless of sexual orientation, are full members of the Body of Christ." The Lambeth Conference is "not an executive which imposes doctrine or discipline but it is a forum where the mind of the Communion can be expressed on matters of controversy."&lt;ref&gt;Site of The Archbishop of Canterbury, [http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/pages/lambeth-conference.html Lambeth Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210203358/http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/pages/lambeth-conference.html# |date=10 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 bishops, including some who voted in favour of the resolution, immediately repudiated it and signed a letter of apology to gay and lesbian Anglicans. However over 80% of the bishops did not do so.
* In 2002, the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], the [[Anglican Diocese of New Westminster|Diocese of New Westminster]] voted to allow the blessing and officiation of same-sex unions and marriages by those parishes who choose to do so.
* The Church of England affirmed in 2005 that lay gay members who have entered into civil partnerships are still eligible for the [[sacrament]]s of [[baptism]], [[confirmation]], and [[Communion (Christian)|communion]].&lt;ref name="Pastoral_statement"&gt;Church of England News, 25 July 2005.[http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2005/07/pr5605.aspx House of Bishops issues pastoral statement on Civil Partnerships].

* [[Sexual orientation]], specifically the [[consecration]] of [[Gene Robinson]], was a major issue at the 2008 [[Lambeth Conferences|Lambeth Conference]]. A group of [[conservative]] bishops opposed to the ordination and marriage of same-sex attracted people, including most of the "[[Global South (Anglican)|global south]]", gathered in June 2008 at the [[Global Anglican Future Conference]].
* In 2013, in the Church of England, "The House [of Bishops] has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships, and living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality, can be considered as candidates for the episcopate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2013/01/statement-regarding-clergy-in-a-civil-partnership-as-candidates-for-the-episcopate.aspx|title=Church of England News: Statement Regarding Clergy in a Civil Partnership as Candidates for the Episcopate|newspaper=Church of England News|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1973 Archbishop of York’s statement===
While serving as Archbishop of York, [[Donald Coggan]] declared on [[BBC]] radio in 1973 that many Anglican clergymen were homosexuals. "We must treat them," he proclaimed, "with great sympathy and understanding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20064731,00.html ''People'' magazine (Dec 2, 1974 Vol. 2 No. 23)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998 Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops===
{{main|Lambeth Conference#3.13 Thirteenth: 1998}}
Regarding "human sexuality", the conference said that it upholds "faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union, and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage." Furthermore, it refused to "advise the legitimising or blessing of same sex unions nor ordaining those involved in same gender unions."&lt;ref&gt;1998 Lambeth Conference, Resolution 1.10, "Human Sexuality", Online at http://www.anglicancommunion.org/resources/document-library/lambeth-conference/1998/section-i-called-to-full-humanity/section-i10-human-sexuality?author=Lambeth+Conference&amp;year=1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The vote was 526-70.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Prichard, ''A History of the Episcopal Church'' (Morehouse 3rd rev ed, 2014), p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999 Cambridge Accord===
{{main|Cambridge Accord}}
In response to the division following the Lambeth Conference of the previous year, most Church of England bishops (although not including the then Archibishop of Canterbury [[George Carey]]), and many others elsewhere in the Anglican Communion, agreed on a document that upheld the human rights of homosexual people, while recognising and not seeking to resolve division over the morality of homosexual acts.

===Gene Robinson consecrated bishop===
In August 2003 the [[Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire]] elected an openly [[gay]] and partnered [[priest]], [[Gene Robinson]], as [[bishop]]. This came shortly after a similar controversy in [[England]] when an [[Coming out|openly]] [[gay]] [[priest]], Canon [[Jeffrey John]], was appointed to become the [[Suffragan bishop|Suffragan Bishop]] of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Eventually, however, John agreed to withdraw in order to avoid division. In 2004, in the aftermath of Robinson's election as [[bishop]], John was installed as [[Dean of St Albans]], the [[cathedral]] there being the site of England's first [[Christian]] [[martyr]].

===2003 Lambeth Palace meeting===
As a result of the controversy over the ordination of [[gay bishops]] and the blessing of [[Civil union|same-sex unions]], on 15 October 2003, Anglican leaders from around the world met in [[Lambeth Palace]] in an attempt to avoid a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] on the issue. The day after, they released a lengthy statement:&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 16 October 2003, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3198992.stm Anglican leaders' statement]. Retrieved 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We must make clear that recent actions in New Westminster and in the Episcopal Church (USA) do not express the mind of our Communion as a whole, and these decisions jeopardise our sacramental fellowship with each other. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If his ''[Gene Robinson's]'' consecration proceeds, we recognise that we have reached a crucial and critical point in the life of the Anglican Communion and we have had to conclude that the future of the Communion itself will be put in jeopardy. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In this case, the ministry of this one bishop will not be recognised by most of the Anglican world, and many provinces are likely to consider themselves to be out of Communion with the Episcopal Church (USA). This will tear the fabric of our Communion at its deepest level, and may lead to further division on this and further issues as provinces have to decide in consequence whether they can remain in communion with provinces that choose not to break communion with the Episcopal Church (USA). ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Similar considerations apply to the situation pertaining in the Diocese of New Westminster. We commend the report of that Conference in its entirety to all members of the Anglican Communion, valuing especially its emphasis on the need to listen to the experience of homosexual persons, and [...] to assure them that they are loved by God and that all baptised, believing and faithful persons, regardless of sexual orientation, are full members of the [[Body of Christ]]"; and its acknowledgement of the need for ongoing study on questions of [[human sexuality]]. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As Primates, it is not for us to pass judgement on the constitutional processes of another province. We recognise the sensitive balance between provincial autonomy and the expression of critical opinion by others on the internal actions of a province.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Statements from Rowan Williams===

In 2004 the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], wrote a letter to Anglican churches worldwide in which he condemned comments by bishops outside the [[Western culture|Western]] world for inciting violence against gay men and women.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 28 November 2004,[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4049013.stm Churches warned over 'gay slurs']. Retrieved 12 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any words that could make it easier for someone to attack or abuse a homosexual person are words of which we must repent. Do not think [[repentance]] is always something others are called to, but acknowledge the failings we all share, [[sin]]ful and struggling [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s as we are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2007 speech to theology students in [[Toronto]], Williams argued that [[Christian fundamentalism|conservatives]] have failed to consider the wider context of [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:27, which states, "and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for error." Williams pointed out that although [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] (the author of this [[epistle]]) and his contemporaries viewed sex between two people of the same sex "as obviously immoral as [[idolatry|idol worship]] or [[obedience (human behavior)|disobedience]] to parents", the main point of this passage is that humans must not judge one another for being [[sin]]ful: Romans 2:1 says "Therefore you have no excuse, O man, whoever you are, when you judge another: for in passing judgment upon him you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things." Williams admitted that his analysis "does nothing to settle the exegetical questions fiercely debated at the moment", but called upon [[Christian fundamentalism|conservatives]] to avoid self-righteousness rather than "happily identifying with Paul's castigation of someone else".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Heneghan, Yahoo!

===Subsequent division===
Bishops from two Anglican provinces, the [[Church of the Province of Rwanda|Province of Rwanda]] and the [[Church of the Province of South East Asia|Province of South East Asia]], consecrated missionary bishops for the United States in January 2000 and formally established the Anglican Mission in America (now called the [[Anglican Mission in the Americas]]) later that year. In 2010, a similar jurisdiction created by the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]] and former members and congregations of the [[Episcopal Church in the USA]] was officially launched. Four dioceses which withdrew from the Episcopal Church account for the majority of the nearly 700 congregations affiliated with this church, the [[Anglican Church in North America]]. These two bodies—AMiA and ACNA—reject the creation of rites for same-sex unions as well as the ordination of openly gay people. Neither is a member of the Anglican Communion at present (see [[Anglican realignment]]).

Bishops in [[Uganda]] cut relations with the [[Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire|Diocese of New Hampshire]] following [[Gene Robinson|Robinson]]'s consecration on 2 November 2003. The [[Church of Nigeria]] declared itself in "impaired communion" with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] on 2 November 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Akinola, [http://www.anglican-nig.org/glbsouthst.htm Statement of the Primates of the Global South in the Anglican Communion in response to the consecration of Gene Robinson on 2 November 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606000650/http://www.anglican-nig.org/glbsouthst.htm |date=6 June 2007 }}.

===Windsor Report and 2005 Primates Meeting===
In 2004, the Lambeth Commission on Communion issued a report on homosexuality in the Anglican Communion, which became known as the [[Windsor Report]]. This report took a strong stand against same-sex attracted people, recommended a moratorium on further consecrations of openly gay bishops and blessings of same-sex unions and marriages,&lt;ref&gt;The Windsor Report 2004.[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/windsor2004/section_d/p3.cfm On public Rites of Blessing of same sex unions].

'''2005 Primates' Meeting.''' In February 2005, the [[Primates in the Anglican Communion|Primates of the Anglican Communion]] held a [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting|regular meeting]] at Dromantine in [[Northern Ireland]] at which sexual orientation was heavily discussed. Of the 38 Primates, 35 attended. The Primates issued a communiqué that reiterated most of the Windsor Report's statements, but added a new twist. Both the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] were asked to voluntarily withdraw from the [[Anglican Consultative Council]], the main formal international entity within the [[Anglican Communion]] until the next [[Lambeth Conference]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;“The Anglican Communion The Primates’ Meeting, February 2005 Communiqué,” Sec 14, 3-4.

===2007 Primates’ Meeting===
The “Communiqué of the Primates’ Meeting, February 2007" (Sec 17, 4) asserted its "belief that The Episcopal Church has departed from the standard of teaching on human sexuality accepted by the Communion in the 1998 Lambeth Resolution 1.10 by consenting to the episcopal election of a candidate living in a committed same-sex relationship, and by permitting Rites of Blessing for same-sex unions. The episcopal ministry of a person living in a same-sex relationship is not acceptable to the majority of the Communion."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/68393/communique2007_english.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consecration of Mary Douglas Glasspool ===

In December 2009, the [[Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles|Diocese of Los Angeles]] elected [[Mary Douglas Glasspool]], a lesbian priest with a female partner as a [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan bishop]]. She was consecrated on 15 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Traditionalist Who Shakes Tradition|author=Lisa Miller|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/236478|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaders from 20 Anglican provinces meeting in [[Singapore]] in April 2010 declared that the election and intended consecration of Glasspool “demonstrated, yet again, a total disregard for the mind of the Communion”.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Bowder, "Trumpet blast from the Global South," ''Church Times'', 21 Apr 2010.

===2016 Primates’ Meeting===
A majority of the primates voted to punish the Episcopal Church for revising its canons and marriage rites allowing same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] at its 2015 triennial [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] adopted "canonical and liturgical changes to provide marriage equality for Episcopalians." The canonical change eliminated "language defining marriage as between a man and a woman." The two new marriage rites contain language that allows "them to be used by same-sex or opposite-sex couples." Episcopal News Service staff, "General Convention wrap-up: Historic actions, structural changes" (7 July 2015). Online at http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2015/07/07/general-convention-wrap-up-historic-actions-structural-changes/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primates' communiqué included these words:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is our unanimous desire to walk together. However given the seriousness of these matters we formally acknowledge this distance by requiring that for a period of three years The Episcopal Church no longer represent us on ecumenical and interfaith bodies, should not be appointed or elected to an internal standing committee and that while participating in the internal bodies of the Anglican Communion, they will not take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or polity.&lt;ref&gt;“Communiqué from the Primates of the Anglican Communion,” 15 Jan 2016.

The communiqué condemned "homophobic prejudice and violence and resolved to work together to offer pastoral care and loving service irrespective of sexual orientation", adding that "this conviction arises out of our discipleship of Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="episcopaldigitalnetwork.com"&gt;Matthew Davies and Mary Frances Schjonberg, "Welby apologizes for persecution on the grounds of sexuality" (Episcopal News Service, January 15, 2016).

====Archbishop of Canterbury apologises====
Shortly after the meeting of the Anglican primates, Archbishop [[Justin Welby]] held a press conference in which he apologised “to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people for the hurt and pain they have experienced by the Anglican Communion over the years.” Welby said, “it is for me a constant source of deep sadness that people are persecuted for their sexuality … I want to take this opportunity personally to say how sorry I am for the hurt and pain in the past and present that the church has caused.”&lt;ref name="episcopaldigitalnetwork.com"/&gt;

==Differing stances==
Within the Anglican Communion there is diverse opinion over [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Factfile: Anglican Church around the world|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/3226753.stm|date=13 February 2007|accessdate=15 February 2008|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We believe that Civil Partnerships still have a place, including for some Christian LGBTI couples who see them as a way of gaining legal recognition of their relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premier.org.uk/News/UK/Keep-civil-partnerships-Church-of-England-urges-Government|title=Keep civil partnerships, Church of England urges Government - Premier|last=Premier|date=2018-05-18|work=Premier|accessdate=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Bishops and Archbishop's Council communicated that "The Church of England recognises that same-sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality.

In December 1991, the House of Bishops issued ''Issues in Human Sexuality''. In the preface, Archbishop [[George Carey]] described it as a document for "careful study and reflection". The conclusion of the document listed questions for reflection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/media/445118/humansexualitych5.pdf ''Issues in Human Sexuality''.]&lt;/ref&gt; On the tenth anniversary of the publication of ''Issues in Human Sexuality'', the Bishop of Wolverhampton, [[Michael Bourke]], wrote that "''Issues'' aspired to help forward a debate on the subject", but rather than serving its stated purpose, "''Issues'' has been presented as a consensus to which all bishops are expected to subscribe. Instead of enabling open and charitable discussion, it has served as an instrument of management and control."&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Brierley, ed., ''Public Life and the Place of the Church: Reflections to Honour the Bishop of Oxford'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of human sexuality erupted when [[Jeffrey John]], an openly gay priest, was elected [[Bishop of Reading]] in May 2003. Before he could take up his post there was strong opposition from a minority of [[bishop]]s and he was persuaded to not proceed with the appointment. However, many senior bishops{{who|date=April 2016}} have voiced disappointment at his decision to resign. Later in 2004 he was installed as [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of St. Albans. Further controversy erupted when churches in the [[Diocese of St Albans]] decided that they would withhold contributions until further notice to protest this appointment. St. Peter and Paul's Church in Cranfield, near [[Bedford]], and [[Holy Trinity]] Church in [[New Barnet]], north of [[Greater London]], pledged to withhold money from diocesan funds in protest. [[St Andrew]]'s Church in the [[Hertfordshire]] town of [[Chorleywood]] also announced that it would withhold funds until further notice. Yet, in 2002, reporters confirmed that hundreds of same-sex blessings occur, although unofficially, every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1410695/Vicars-bless-hundreds-of-gay-couples-a-year.html|title=Vicars bless hundreds of gay couples a year|last=Bisset|first=By Chris Hastings, Fiona Govan and Susan|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, "the majority of Bishops who voted during the whole passage of the Civil Partnerships Act through [the] Lordships' House were in favour of civil partnerships."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/5069/archbishop-justins-speech-to-the-lords-on-the-governments-gay-marriage-bill|title=Archbishop Justin's speech to the Lords on the government's gay marriage Bill|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight bishops voted in favour of civil unions and two voted against the passage of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media/1472983/cptimeline.doc|title=The Lords Spiritual and Civil Partnership Legislation|last=|first=|date=2004|website=www.churchofengland.org|publisher=Church of England|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2005, the House of Bishops issued a pastoral statement on the “implications of the [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|Civil Partnerships]]” which came into force on 5 December 2005. The statement reaffirmed “the Church’s teaching on both marriage and sexual intercourse”. It also noted that “the new legislation makes no change to the law in relation to marriage”.&lt;ref name="churchofengland.org"&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2005/07/pr5605.aspx Bishops’ Pastoral Statement on Civil Partnerships. Retrieved July 27, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; The statement went on to say that “clergy of the Church of England should not provide services of blessing for those who register a civil partnership”. However, it said that if clergy are “approached by people asking for prayer in relation to entering into a civil partnership,” they should “respond pastorally and sensitively”. Regarding clergy themselves, “entering into a civil partnership” was not considered “intrinsically incompatible with holy orders, provided the person concerned is willing to give assurances to his or her bishop that the relationship is consistent with the standards for the clergy set out in [https://www.churchofengland.org/media/445118/humansexualitych5.pdf ''Issues in Human Sexuality'' (House of Bishops, December 1991).]”. "The House of Bishops considers it would be a matter of social injustice to exclude from ministry those who are faithful to the teaching of the Church, and who decide to register a civil partnership."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2005/07/pr5605.aspx|title=Church of England News: House of Bishops issues pastoral statement on Civil Partnerships|work=Church of England News|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;However, the statement said that “lay people who have registered civil partnerships ought not to be asked to give assurances about the nature of their relationship before being admitted to baptism, confirmation and communion.’&lt;ref name="churchofengland.org" /&gt;

On 21 December 2005, in another controversial act which was contrary to the House of Bishops’ pastoral statement, the Rt. Rev. David Jenkins, the former Bishop of Durham, offered a blessing for a vicar who had entered into a same-sex partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506074/Church-blessing-for-homosexual-vicar.html|title=Church blessing for homosexual vicar|last=Correspondent|first=By Jonathan Petre, Religion|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] adopted a motion. In part it read that nothing should be done “that could be perceived as the Church of England qualifying its commitment to the entirety of the relevant Lambeth Conference Resolutions”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/marriage,-family-and-sexuality-issues/human-sexuality/lesbian-and-gay-christians,-general-synod-debate-2007.aspx Lesbian and Gay Christians Synod Debate]&lt;/ref&gt; At Lambeth Conference 1998, homosexuality was that the most hotly debated issue. Its Resolution 1.10 stated in an amendment passed by a vote of 389–190 that "homosexual practice" is "incompatible with Scripture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/76650/1998.pdf Resolutions Archive from 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, in spite of the action by the General Synod, St Bartholomew's Church in London offered a rite of blessing for two priests entering into a same-sex civil partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wynne-Jones|first1=Jonathan|title=Male priests marry in Anglican church's first gay 'wedding'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2130668/Male-priests-marry-in-Anglican-churchs-first-gay-wedding.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph UK|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, other dioceses and parishes supported the inclusion of gay and lesbian priests. In 2008, the Diocese of London provided guidelines saying "clergy ... may use a form of service they consider suitable in respect of a civil partnership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seed|first1=Nigel|title=Church Services After A Civil Partnership|url=http://inclusive-church.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/Chancellor%20Nigel%20Seed%20Guidance.pdf|website=inclusive-church.org.uk|publisher=Diocese of London|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, some churches "[offer] dedication services to civil partners" as allowed within those guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9853688/Gay-marriage-priests-to-defy-Church-line-with-same-sex-services.html|title=Gay marriage: priests to defy Church line with same-sex services|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the General Synod voted to extend pensions and employee benefits to gay and lesbian priests living with their partners in civil unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Church of England General Synod extends pension rights for gay partners|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/11/anglican-synod-gay-pension-rights|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2010-02-11|access-date = 2016-02-24|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = Stephen|last = Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the House of Bishops ruled that priests in same-sex civil partnerships could be consecrated as bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/04/church-of-england-gay-bishops|title=Church of England rules gay men in civil partnerships can become bishops|last=Walker|first=Peter|date=2013-01-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the House of Bishops of the Church of England commissioned a Working Group on Human Sexuality.

In 2018, the Irish bishops released a statement on the continuing conversations surrounding human sexuality.

===Scottish Episcopal Church===
{{Main|Scottish Episcopal Church}}

The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] (SEC) does not have a policy against [[Ordination|ordaining]] non-celibate gay clergy, thus such ordinations are theoretically allowed. They announced this on 23 March 2005:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[We] had never regarded the fact that someone was in a close relationship with a member of the same sex as in itself constituting a bar to the exercise of an ordained ministry ... We do not have a synodical decision like the Church of England has, which it made a number of years ago, and therefore if someone who was of a homosexual orientation felt a sense of call to the ordained ministry then we would begin the process of testing that vocation. We wouldn't bar him or her simply because they were homosexual."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Headlines in [[North America]] announced that the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] had agreed to ordain gay and lesbian people in committed relationships. The Church thus released a statement pointing out that the policy was not news. Regarding the media release, the Church said: "Press interest has focused on one small part of the overall statement". It continued to say that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In referring to the fact that there is no current bar to ordination for someone who might be in a close relationship with a member of the same sex, the Bishops were simply stating the present position as it applies in Scotland where, unlike some other provinces, no motion discouraging such ordinations has ever been passed by our General Synod. Consequently, the statement earlier this month does not represent any change in policy on the part of the Bishops."&lt;ref&gt;Thinking Anglicans: Book review archives, 24 March 2005.[http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/001085.html More on Scotland].

The Church of South [[India]], although divided in opinion like many Anglican provinces, has many outspoken clergy in favour of rights for same-sex couples. "The Church of South India (CSI) [is] a relatively liberal Protestant church which has, since 1984, allowed women to become pastors. 'CSI has been liberal on these issues.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The said confirmation therefore seriously raises the question of ECUSA's genuine commitment to our corporate responsibility as members of the church catholic to uphold and promote only the Apostolic Faith and Order inherited.

On 24 November 2003, the province declared that it had entered into a state of impaired communion with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] by releasing the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Synod of the Province of the Anglican Church of South East Asia unanimously rejects the purported consecration of Dr Gene Robinson on 2 November 2003 by the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, in New Hampshire, as a bishop in the Anglican Church. The Province views the purported consecration as a flagrant disregard of the fundamental teachings of the Bible and the long-established doctrines of the Church.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As the Rev. Gene Robinson is a practising homosexual who had divorced his wife and has, for the last 13 years, been living with a male partner, the Province cannot and does not recognize his consecration and ministry in the Anglican church.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In view of the ECUSA's action in proceeding with the consecration despite the warnings and pleas of a large majority of Anglican churches worldwide, the Province regrets that communion with the ECUSA as well as those who voted for the consecration and those who participated in the consecration service is now broken.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This means that the Province no longer treats those in ECUSA who carried out and supported the act of consecration as brothers and sisters in Christ unless and until they repent of their action and return to embrace Biblical truths. At the same time, the Province remains in fellowship with the faithful believers within ECUSA who rightly oppose and reject the erroneous actions of their house.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This decision was made unanimously at an extraordinary meeting of the Synod held in Kudat, Sabah, Malaysia, on 20 November 2003."&lt;ref name="SEAsia_break" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Archbishop [[Gregory James Venables|Gregory Venables]] has also been strongly critical of homosexuality. Bishops in his province criticised the Windsor Report for failing to call liberal churches to repentance. The province has declared itself in "impaired communion" with ECUSA, but continues to maintain full communion with opponents of the Robinson consecration.&lt;ref&gt;Anglican Communion News Service, 12 January 2004.

Retrieved 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Venables has authorised dioceses within his province to provide episcopal oversight to United States churches that have left ECUSA.

In December 2007, the convention of the [[Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] diocese in [[Central Valley (California)|central]] [[California]], voted to leave the ECUSA and joined the [[Anglican Church of South America|Province of the Southern Cone]] as the [[Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin]]. A minority of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Diocese remained in the ECUSA. In October 2008, a majority of the convention of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh]] voted to leave ECUSA and affiliate with the [[Anglican Church of South America|Southern Cone]], resulting in [[Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh|one body affiliated with the Southern Cone]] and [[Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh (Episcopal Church)|a second body remaining within ECUSA]]. The following month, the conventions of two more US dioceses—the [[Diocese of Quincy (Southern Cone)|Diocese of Quincy]] in [[Illinois]] and the [[Diocese of Fort Worth (Southern Cone)|Diocese of Fort Worth]] in [[Texas]]—voted to leave ECUSA and affiliate with the Southern Cone. All were subsequently absorbed into the new [[Anglican Church in North America]].

However, some Anglican representatives from the Diocese of Uruguay expressed their support for the inclusion of same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/112756-curas-uruguayos-se-reconocen-gay-a-pesar-de-mantenerse-celibes|title=Curas uruguayos se reconocen gay a pesar de mantenerse célibes|website=LARED21|language=es-ES|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episcopal Anglican Church of Brazil===
{{Main|Igreja Episcopal Anglicana do Brasil }}
The [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]] is characterised by its [[progressive Christianity|progressive]] [[Theology|theological]] views on homosexuality. After the 1998 [[Lambeth]] Conference, the Anglican Church in Brazil decided to promote two national forums on [[human sexuality]], both held in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Its decisions guided the policy. According to the final document, the consensus of the Brazilian Church is that [[human sexuality]] is a gift from [[God]], and it should be experienced in peace, freedom, love and respect. The Church has approved of the ordination of openly gay priests and has offered blessing services for same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guiame.com.br/gospel/mundo-cristao/anglicanos-dividem-opinioes-sobre-homossexualidade.html|title=Anglicanos dividem opiniões sobre homossexualidade, Notícias Gospel|last=Guiame|website=Guiame|language=pt-BR|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood that the [[Christianity|Church]] should respect the privacy of its members and [[clergy]]. Any kind of public exposure of someone's [[sexual orientation]] (as a pre-requisite to be a member or take part of any ministry) violates this privacy. Because of that progressive position, the [[Bishop]] of the Diocese of Recife, still strongly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], Robinson Cavalcanti, declared Recife to be independent of the [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil|Church of Brazil]], an action that resulted in his being deposed as a bishop by the [[Ecclesiastical Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Orlando Santos de Oliveira, 17 June 2005. [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~lcrew/dojustice/j311b.html Canonical Trial # 001/2005 of Bishop Edward Robinson de Barros Cavalcanti]. Retrieved 22 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his main reasons, he pointed out that the Brazilian Church was sympathetic to the ordination of [[Gene Robinson]], as well as the ordination of all [[LGBT]] people. This split the Diocese of Recife in two: one part loyal to Bishop Orlando Santos de Oliveira, primate of the [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]], and currently coordinated by Bishop Sebastião Gameleira, and the other, under Cavalcanti's leadership, tied to the [[Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of the Americas|Anglican Church of the Southern Cone]].

In 2003, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|ECUSA]] became the first [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] province to ordain an openly gay priest in a same-sex relationship as a bishop; however, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]'s stance on [[LGBT]] matters had been debated for decades. In 1976, the Church's [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] passed a resolution stating: "It is the sense of this General Convention that homosexual persons are children of God who have a full and equal claim with all other persons upon the love acceptance, and pastoral concern and care of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;The Archives of the Episcopal Church, [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=1976-A069 Acts of Convention: Resolution #1976-A069]. Retrieved 20013-7-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the first openly gay and lesbian priest was ordained by Bishop Paul Moore Jr. in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/06/us/lesbian-ordained-episcopal-priest.html|title=LESBIAN ORDAINED EPISCOPAL PRIEST|last=Steinfels|first=Peter|date=1991-06-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various interpretations were held within the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] on this resolution, ranging from the majority of [[diocese]]s that now ordain non-celibate [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] [[clergy]] to the minority group who founded the [[Anglican Communion Network]] which currently opposes such ordinations. On 23 June 2005, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|The Episcopal Church]] defined its meaning in a 130-page document entitled "To Set Our Hope on Christ":
&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe that God has been opening our eyes to acts of God that we had not known how to see before ... the eligibility for ordination of those in covenanted same-sex unions ... a person living in a same-gendered union may be eligible to lead the flock of Christ ... members of the Episcopal Church have discerned holiness in same-sex relationships and have come to support the blessing of such unions and the ordination or consecration of persons in those unions ... Their holiness stands in stark contrast with many sinful patterns of sexuality in the world ... The idea that there is only one correct way to read or interpret scripture is a rather modern idea.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Lawless, Associated Press, 21 June 2005. [http://aacblog.classicalanglican.net/archives/2005_06.html#000759 U.S. Episcopals Defend Openly Gay Bishop]. Accessed 17 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2009, the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] voted to allow [[bishop]]s to [[blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|bless same-sex unions]], and also called for bishops to "collect and develop theological and liturgical resources" for possibly creating an [[Wedding|official rite]] for such ceremonies at the 2012 General Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/us/16episcopal.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Episcopal Bishops Give Ground on Gay Marriage | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein | date=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=94111  |title=Gays make advances at Episcopal confab |first=Chuck Colbert |date=24 July 2009 |publisher=[[Edge Media Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the Reverend Mally Lloyd and the Reverend [[Katherine Hancock Ragsdale]], two prominent [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priests, married in a [[Wedding|ceremony]] at the [[Cathedral Church of St. Paul (Boston)|Cathedral Church of St. Paul]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/01/06/Two_Lesbian_Priests_Tie_the_Knot/ Advocate:Two Lesbian Priests Tie the Knot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108005623/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/01/06/Two_Lesbian_Priests_Tie_the_Knot/ |date=8 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the General Convention approved an official liturgy for blessing same-sex unions, called “The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant,” while making it clear that it was not marriage. The action enabled priests to bestow the church’s blessing on gay couples even in states where same-sex marriage is illegal, subject to the approval of the bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/us/episcopalians-approve-rite-to-bless-same-sex-unions.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |work=The New York Times |title=Episcopalians Approve Rite to Bless Same-Sex Unions |first=Laurie |last=Goodstein |date=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the General Convention approved “canonical and liturgical changes to provide marriage equality for Episcopalians.” The canonical change eliminated “language defining marriage as between a man and a woman.” The liturgical change provided two marriage rites for use by same-sex or opposite-sex couples with consent of the priest and permission of the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Episcopal News Service staff, “General Convention wrap-up: Historic actions, structural changes” (July 7, 2015).

The [[Anglican Church in Central America]] consists of five churches representing different Central American countries. Each member church makes many of its own decisions. In 2013, priests and ministries in the Diocese of El Salvador began to advocate for the full inclusion of LGBT members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The Anglican Church of Mexico, like the other North American provinces, has expressed in some particular instances more liberal views regarding gender and sexuality. However, Presiding Bishop Francisco Moreno has opposed same-sex unions and the current canons do not provide for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/articulo/anglicanos-y-mormones-contra-matrimonios-gay|title=Anglicanos y mormones contra matrimonios gay|website=Vanguardia|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, then Presiding Bishop Carlos Touché-Porter became a patron of Inclusive Church advocating for '"a liberal, open church which is inclusive of all,' regardless of race, gender or sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/scotland-primus-becomes-co-patron-inclusive-church|title=SCOTLAND: Primus becomes co-patron of Inclusive Church {{!}} Episcopal Church|website=www.episcopalchurch.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Presiding Bishop Carlos Touché-Porter also affirmed that Bishop Gene Robinson was not the first gay cleric, but that he was simply being honest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Figueroa|first1=Héctor|title=Habrá obispo mexicana en unos años: Iglesia Anglicana|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2014/07/20/971841|website=excelsior.com.mx|publisher=Excelsior|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported the ordination of openly gay clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/archbishops-gay-plea-640318|title=Archbishop's gay plea|last=Qureshi|first=Yakub|date=2007-10-03|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Touché-Porter's diocese, the Diocese of Mexico, "permits clergy in same-sex relationships to serve in the ministry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://geoconger.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/mexico-backs-anglican-covenant-the-church-of-england-newspaper-july-9-2010-p-5/|title=Mexico backs Anglican Covenant: The Church of England Newspaper, July 9, 2010 p 5|date=2010-07-17|website=Conger|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchnewspaper.com/?s=Mexico|title=Mexico backs Anglican Covenant|last=Conger|first=George|date=August 7, 2010|website=churchnewspaper.com|publisher=The Church of England Newspaper|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2008, when Pope Benedict XVI approached the Anglican Church with the possibility of joining the Catholic Church over issues of sexuality, then Presiding Bishop Carlos reassured his province that he supported remaining within the Anglican Communion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramírez|first1=Mariana Viayra|title=Anglicanos mexicanos rechazan unirse a la Iglesia católica|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2009/467560.html|website=cronica.com.mx|publisher=La Crónica|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican Church of Southern Africa===
{{Main|Anglican Church of Southern Africa}}

The canon law of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa states that "marriage by divine institution is a lifelong and exclusive union partnership between one man and one woman" and makes no provision for same-sex weddings or for blessing same-sex civil unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anglicanchurchsa.org/canons/chapter-c34-disipline/|title=C34: OF HOLY MATRIMONY – Anglican Church of Southern Africa|website=anglicanchurchsa.org|language=en-ZA|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diocese of Saldanha Bay]] has approved the blessing of same-sex civil unions as a provison on the diocesan level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/churchs-decision-to-bless-same-sex-unions-hailed-17390688|title=Church's decision to bless same-sex unions hailed {{!}} Cape Times|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the church does not have an official stance on homosexuality itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/3226753.stm|title=Anglican Church around the world|date=2008-07-15|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been reported of current Archbishop Thabo Makgoba that "The Anglican Primate, [is] one among few church leaders in Africa to support same-sex marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/why.this.archbishop.wept.when.his.church.rejected.gays/96936.htm|title=Why This Archbishop Wept When His Church Rejected Same-Sex Blessings {{!}} Christian News on Christian Today|website=www.christiantoday.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Makgoba and his working group on human sexuality have proposed a motion “… to amend Canon 34 which will enable ministry to those in Same Sex Unions and the LGBTI Community in the context in which ACSA operates in Southern Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchnewspaper.com/49159/archives|title=South Africa Church plans to amend marriage Canon – ChurchNewspaper.com|website=www.churchnewspaper.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous archbishop, [[Desmond Tutu]], said that: "The [[Jesus]] I worship is not likely to collaborate with those who vilify and persecute an already oppressed minority&amp;nbsp;[...]. I could not myself keep quiet whilst people were being penalised for something about which they could do nothing, their sexuality. For it is so improbable that any sane, normal person would deliberately choose a lifestyle exposing him or her to so much vilification, opprobrium and physical abuse, even death. To discriminate against our sisters and brothers who are lesbian or gay on grounds of their sexual orientation for me is as totally unacceptable and unjust as Apartheid ever was.&lt;ref&gt;Archbishop Desmond Tutu, 1 February 2004.[http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/12039.htm Sermon at Southwark Cathedral]. Accessed 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;"

Another former archbishop, [[Njongonkulu Ndungane]], has criticised other African churches regarding homosexuality and said that the church's attention should be focused on other concerns such as [[AIDS]] and [[poverty]]. Nevertheless, Ndungane expressed publicly his disapproval of [[same-sex marriage]] when it was legalised in [[South Africa]]: "As far as we are concerned as a church, our understanding of marriage is between a man and a woman. And as a church, and the Anglican Church in particular, we have said no to same-sex unions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingattitude.org.uk/archives/2083|title=Archbishop Njongonkulu of Cape Town declares same-sex marriages unchristian 9 December 2004|work=changingattitude.org.uk|access-date=3 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182152/http://changingattitude.org.uk/archives/2083|archive-date=14 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2016, the bishops of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa voted to affirm members in same-gender marriages as fully equal members of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Additionally, the Anglican Church of Southern Africa does not have an official policy regarding the ordination of openly gay or lesbian clergy and, thus, some may identify as LGBT depending on their diocese.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global trend: World's oldest Protestant churches now ordain gays and lesbians|url=http://www.ucc.org/global-trend-worlds-oldest|website=ucc.org|publisher=United Church of Christ|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, for example, the Rev.

Rev. Mervyn Castle, who is openly gay and celibate, was consecrated suffragan bishop in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYHcK6kWcPAC|title=Aliens in the Household of God: Homosexuality and Christian Faith in South Africa|last=Germond|first=Paul|date=1997-01-01|publisher=New Africa Books|isbn=9780864863300|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, while gay and lesbian clergy may be locally ordained, the national church has not yet developed liturgies to bless same-gender unions.

Nevertheless, the Diocese of Cape Town, in 2009, did vote in favour of recognising same-gender unions pastorally and the diocese committed itself to studying the issue further.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution of the Diocese of Cape Town on Ministry to Gays and Lesbians in Covenanted Partnerships|url=http://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2009/08/resolution-of-diocese-of-cape-town-on.html|website=anglicanchurchsa.org|publisher=Anglican Church of Southern Africa|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote in 2009 "[had] taken a small step towards accepting gay people in 'faithful, committed relationships.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/church-makes-key-decision-on-gay-couples-456065|title=Church makes key decision on gay couples {{!}} IOL|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution also said that it is "Affirming a pastoral response to same-sex partnerships of faithful commitment in our parish families;"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Also in 2009, Archbishop Thabo Makgoba said that "[g]ays and lesbians can be leaders within the Anglican Church of Southern Africa as long as they remain celibate, its synod of bishops has declared."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/sexual-orientation-no-barrier-to-church-leadership-in-southern-africa-8688|title=Sexual orientation no barrier to church leadership in Southern Africa|website=www.anglicanjournal.com|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Provincial Synod adopted a resolution that "urged its bishops to provide guidelines for giving pastoral care to same-sex couples who have entered civil unions under South African law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/southern-africa-church-considers-pastoral-response-civil-unions|title=Southern Africa: Church considers pastoral response to civil unions|date=2013-10-04|work=Episcopal Church|access-date=2017-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution also:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2013/10/anglican-church-of-southern-africa-considers-pastoral-response-to-civil-unions.aspx|title=Anglican Church of Southern Africa considers Pastoral Response to Civil Unions|website=www.anglicannews.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Bishop Raphael Hess of Sadanha Bay gave permission for an Anglican priest to officiate at a service of celebration for the Rev. Mpho Tutu and her partner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Tutu surrendered her licence to avoid controversy, Bishop Hess stated that he "hoped it would be short-lived" and that he is proposing to change policy to welcome her back. Her father, Desmond Tutu, gave "a father's blessing".&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /&gt;

Currently, priests may not enter into a same-sex marriage, but the church does allow "same-sex relationships if they are celibate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/mpho-tutu-van-furth-its-painful-to-step-down-from-my-priestly-ministry|title=Desmond Tutu's daughter: 'painful' to give up ministry after marrying woman|last=correspondent|first=Harriet Sherwood Religion|date=2016-06-09|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2016, Archbishop Makgoba said "we also tried at the Synod of Bishops to draw up guidelines for clergy wanting to bless couples in same-sex unions, or who want to enter same-sex unions themselves ...

He said the issue might hopefully be taken up again at the next provincial synod in 2019. He also said the issue could be discussed at the local level in parishes and dioceses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Makgoba further noted how relatively liberal the province is saying "As it was, the degree of support for the motion was quite substantial if you compare us to other African provinces of the Anglican Church, most of which are vigorously opposed to same-sex unions in any form."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2016/10/the-anglican-church-of-southern-africas.html|title=The Anglican Church of Southern Africa's debate on human sexuality - Archbishop Thabo Makgoba|website=archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also voiced his support for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/why.this.archbishop.wept.when.his.church.rejected.gays/96936.htm|title=Why This Archbishop Wept When His Church Rejected Same-Sex Blessings {{!}} Christian News on Christian Today|website=www.christiantoday.com|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pastoral letter published on March 2, 2017, the Bench of Bishops said that they continue to discuss "the Pastoral Guidelines for ministry to those in same-sex relationships, which are still incomplete.

In November 2003, responding to the consecration of [[Bishop]] [[Gene Robinson]], [[Archbishop]] [[Donald Mtetemela]] stated his belief that homosexuality is against [[Bible|biblical]] teaching: "The Anglican Church of Tanzania believes that homosexuality is contrary to the teaching of the Word of God. It is a sin."&lt;ref name="Tanzania"&gt;Afrol News, 13 November 2003. [http://www.afrol.com/articles/10473 Church of Tanzania breaks ties with US church]. Retrieved 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Mtetemela declared that the [[Anglican Church of Tanzania|Church of Tanzania]] was no longer in communion with [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] bishops who participated in the [[consecration]] of Robinson, and those who permit the [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessing of same-sex unions]].&lt;ref name="Tanzania"/&gt;

===Church of the Province of Uganda===

The Ugandan church cut ties with its North American counterparts over homosexuality. It declared itself in full communion with the [[Anglican Church in North America]], a denomination not recognised by the Anglican Communion that was formed by lay and [[clergy]] members who had left [[Episcopal Church (United States)|The Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] over matters of [[LGBT]] inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acnaassembly.org/index2.php/acna/page/109 |title=Church of Uganda Declares itself in Full Communion with Anglican Church in North America |author=Church of Uganda |publisher=Anglican Church in North America |accessdate=11 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628104434/http://www.acnaassembly.org/index2.php/acna/page/109 |archivedate=28 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Archbishop Orombi, then the leader of the Church of Uganda, criticised the Church of England for permitting priests to enter into same-sex civil partnerships.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2013, Archbishop Stanley Ntagali maintained opposition to clergy in civil unions opposing the Church of England's decision to allow bishops to register a civil partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1312365/ntagali-attacks-church-england-gay-bishops|title=Ntagali attacks Church of England over gay bishops|newspaper=www.newvision.co.ug|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Ntagali stated that “to allow clergy in civil partnerships to be eligible to become Bishops is really no different from allowing gay Bishops.  This decision violates our Biblical faith and agreements within the Anglican Communion.”&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchnewspaper.com/30492/archives|title=African outrage over civil partnership decision|last=Conger|first=George|date=January 16, 2013|website=churchnewspaper.com|access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ntagali compared England's decision to those made in other western Anglican provinces. “Sadly we must also declare that if the Church of England continues in this contrary direction we must further separate ourselves from it and we are prepared to take the same actions as those prompted by the decisions of The Episcopal Church (USA) and the Anglican Church of Canada ten years ago.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Church of Melanesia ===
{{Main|Church of Melanesia}}In 1998, the Council of Bishops requested that the Rt Rev Terry Brown "draft a study paper on homosexuality for the Church of Melanesia&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~lcrew/dojustice/j194.html|title=Further Reflections on Homosexuality, Christian Faith and the Church|last=Brown|first=Terry|date=2000|website=rci.rutgers.edu|publisher=Rutgers|access-date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bishop Terry Brown, a former Bishop of Malaita reflected on his experience "as an 'out' gay man serving as bishop".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.episcopalcafe.com/another_gay_bishop/|title=Another Gay bishop|date=2007-09-07|website=Episcopal Cafe|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220091332/http://www.episcopalcafe.com/another_gay_bishop/|archivedate=20 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2017, the Synod of the Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church released a statement of support expressing its solidarity with the [[Spanish Evangelical Church]] after the latter had accepted same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.periodistadigital.com/religion/espana/2017/03/22/religion-iglesia-confesiones-espana-madrid-los-anglicanos-se-solidarizan-con-la-iglesia-evangelica-espanola.shtml|title=Los anglicanos se solidarizan con la Iglesia Evangélica Española|last=Madrid|first=Ministros anglicanos de|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In supporting the Spanish Evangelical Church, the Episcopal Synod joined LGBT advocacy groups by protesting its removal from the Evangelical Council of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://protestantedigital.com/ciudades/41763/Solidaridad_de_IERE_y_colectivos_LGTB_con_la_IEE_en_contra_del_CEM|title=Anglicanos y colectivos LGTB apoyan una iglesia inclusiva dentro del CEM|website=protestantedigital|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Punch, [[Franciscans|O.F.M.]]''' (or '''John Ponce''' or, in the Latinate form, '''Johannes Poncius''')&lt;ref&gt;John Punch; Johannes Poncius&lt;/ref&gt; (1603–1661) was an Irish [[Franciscan]] [[scholastic philosopher]] and theologian.

Punch was ultimately responsible for the now classic formulation of [[Ockham's Razor]], in the shape of the Latin phrase ''entia non-sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem'', "entities are not to be multiplied unnecessarily."&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Crombie]], ''Medieval and Early Modern Science'' II (1959 edition) pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; His formulation was slightly different: ''Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate.''&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;Johannes Poncius’s commentary on John Duns Scotus's ''Opus Oxoniense'', book III, dist. 34, q. 1. in John Duns Scotus ''Opera Omnia'', vol.15, Ed. Luke Wadding, Louvain (1639), reprinted Paris: Vives, (1894) p.483a&lt;/ref&gt; Punch did not attribute this wording to William of Ockham, but instead referred to the principle as a "common axiom" (''axioma vulgare'') used by the Scholastics.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt;

==Life==
His name was John Punch, but he is often known as "Ponce", which was a derivation of the Latin form of his surname: Poncius. At an early age, he went to [[Belgium]] and entered the novitiate of the Irish Franciscans in St. Antony's College, [[Leuven|Louvain]]. He studied philosophy at [[Cologne]], began the study of theology in Louvain, under [[Aodh Buidhe Mac an Bhaird|Hugh Ward]], O.F.M. and John Colgan, O.F.M., was called by [[Luke Wadding]] to Rome, and admitted 7 September 1625 into the [[College of St. Isidore]], which had just been founded for the education of Irish Franciscan friars. After receiving his degrees he was appointed to teach philosophy and later, theology in St. Isidore's. He lectured afterwards at [[Lyon]]s and Paris, where he was held in great repute for his learning.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

Punch succeeded Father Martin Walsh in governing Ludovisi College at Rome for the education of Irish [[secular priest]]s; and for some time he filled the position of superior of St. Isidore. He had a passionate love of his country and was an active agent in Rome of the Irish [[Confederate Catholics]]. When dissensions arose among the Confederates, and when [[Richard Bellings]], secretary to the Supreme Council, published his ''Vindiciæ'' (Paris, 1652), attacking the Irish Catholics who remained faithful to the nuncio, Father Punch promptly answered with his "Vindiciae Eversae" (Paris, 1652). He had already warned the Confederates not to trust the Royalists. In a letter (2 July 1644) to the agent of the Catholics, [[Hugo de Burgo]], he says: 

:"the English report that the king will not give satisfaction to our commissioners (from the Confederates) though he keep them in expectation and to delay them for his own interest".

==Works==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2015}}
In 1643 he published in Rome his ''Cursus philosophiæ''. Some of his opinions were opposed by [[Mastrius]], and Punch replied in ''Appendix apologeticus'' (Rome, 1645), in which he says that although he accepts all the conclusions of [[Duns Scotus]], he does not feel called upon to adopt all Scotus's proofs. Mastrius acknowledged the force of Punch's reasoning and admitted that he had shed light on many philosophical problems. In 1652, Punch published "Integer cursus theologiæ" (Paris). These two works explain with great clearness and precision the teaching of the Scotistic school. In 1661, he published at Paris his great work, "Commentarii theologici in quatuor libros sententiarum", called by Hurter opus rarissimum.

Punch also assisted Luke Wadding in editing the works of Scotus. Wadding says that he was endowed with a powerful and subtle intellect, a great facility of communicating knowledge, a graceful style, and that though immersed in the severer studies of philosophy and theology he was an ardent student of the classics.

His other works are:
*"Judicium doctrinæ SS. Augustini et Thomæ", Paris, 1657;
*"Scotus Hiberniae restitutus", in answer to Father [[Angelus of St. Francis Mason]], who claimed Scotus as an Englishman;
*"Deplorabilis populi Hibernici pro religione, rege et libertate status" (Paris, 1651).

'''Judah ben Jehiel''', ({{lang-he|יהודה בן יחיאל}}, {{circa}} 1420 to 1425 – c. 1498), more usually called '''Judah Messer Leon''' ({{lang-he|יהודה מסר לאון}}), was an [[Italian Jews|Italian]] [[rabbi]], teacher, [[physician]], and [[philosopher]]. Through his works, assimilating and embodying the intellectual approach of the best Italian universities of the time, yet setting it inside the intellectual culture of Jewish tradition, he is seen as a quintessential example of a ''hakham kolel'' ("comprehensive scholar"), a scholar who excelled in both secular and rabbinic studies, the Hebrew equivalent of a [[polymath|Renaissance man]]. This was the ideal he tried to instil in his students.

==Life==
Judah is thought to have been born in around 1420 at [[Montecchio Maggiore]], now in the Italian [[province of Vicenza]]. The son of a doctor, he was ordained as a rabbi and received a diploma in medicine while in his early 20s. According to tradition the honorific title ''Messer'' (a title of [[knight]]hood) was bestowed on him by the [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]], during the emperor's first visit to Italy in 1452, perhaps for work for him as a physician. The name "[[Leon (given name)|Leon]]" is the usual equivalent of "[[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]]", through the traditional identification of the [[lion of Judah]].

Messer Leon settled as a rabbi at [[Ancona]] at about this time, and established a ''[[yeshiva]]'', or academy, where he combined the traditional study of the Jewish texts with lectures on the non-Jewish program of the medieval secular curriculum. This academy was to follow him wherever he stayed around Italy over the next four decades. He was also licensed to practice medicine, and his successful activities in this field brought him much acclaim. Between 1456 and 1472 he lived in [[Padua]] and [[Bologna]], where he may have studied further at the famous Universities. He is said to have been awarded the title Doctor in Padua in 1469. After a short stay in [[Venice]], where his son [[David ben Judah Messer Leon|David]] was born, in 1473 he became rabbi in [[Mantua]]. There he fell into a conflict with his colleague [[Joseph Colon Trabotto]], in consequence of which both were expelled from the city in 1475.

In 1480 he settled in [[Naples]], then under the accommodating rule of [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand I]]. He remained there, with his academy, for virtually the whole of the rest of his life, until he and his son David were forced to flee in 1495, the year after the death of King Ferdinand, to escape the violent pogroms that ensued following the capture of the city by the French under [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. An ordination document issued by David in September 1499 refers to his father as by then already dead. Rabinowitz conjectures that Messer Leon had been with David, and died at Monastir (present-day [[Bitola]] in the [[Republic of Macedonia]]) in that year. However, Tirosh-Rothschild (p.&amp;nbsp;253, n. 104) believes he was still in Naples, and died there in 1497.

==Works==
Messer Leon wrote extensively, including commentaries on the ''[[Organon]]'', the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', and the [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'' of Aristotle]], and their analysis by [[Averroes]], in which he followed the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] style and methods, composing for his students "summaries (''sefeqot'') on the Scholastic ''quaestiones'' (i.e. points of apparent textual contradiction) debated by the Italian academic community",&lt;ref&gt;Zonta p. 210, quoting Tirosh-Rothschild&lt;/ref&gt; drawing closely on the style and substance of expositions then current at Padua.

These commentaries were written primarily for his close followers. More generally circulated were three textbooks addressing the three foundation subjects of a Renaissance secular education, the ''[[trivium]]'' ("three ways") of [[grammar]], [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]], seen as the essential prerequisite disciplines necessary for higher studies in the humanities, philosophy, and medicine. These subjects he covered with a Hebrew grammar under the title ''Libnat ha-Sappir'' (''The Pavement of Sapphire'') in 1454, a textbook on logic entitled ''Miklal Yofi'' (''Perfection of Beauty'') in 1455, and, most celebrated, a textbook of rhetoric called ''Nofet Zufim'' (''The Honeycomb's Flow''), which was printed by [[Abraham Conat]] of Mantua in 1475-6, the only work by a living author printed in Hebrew in the fifteenth century.

Like non-Jewish contemporary texts, the ''Nofet Zufim'' drew heavily on the classical theoretical writings of [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]]. But unlike its contemporaries, it took as its exemplars for such theories not the foremost orators of Greek and Roman antiquity, but [[Moses]] and the leading figures of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In the opinion of Deutsch,&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; the object of the work was both [[apologetics|apologetic]] and [[propaganda|propagandic]]. The author desired to demonstrate to the non-Jewish world that the Jews were not devoid of the literary sense, and he wished to prove to his co-religionists that [[Judaism]] is not hostile to secular studies, which contribute to a better appreciation of Jewish literature. Although in later centuries the book was largely forgotten, and was not reprinted until the nineteenth century, in the intellectual circle of its own time it was highly appreciated. [[Azariah dei Rossi]] quoted Leon as a witness to the value of secular studies,&lt;ref&gt;ch. ii., in ''Me'or 'Enayim'', ed. Benjacob, i. 75, Wilna, 1863&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]] recommended the book to the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] [[Zeraḥ bar Natan]] of [[Trakai]].&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, ''Melo Chofnajim'', p. 19, Berlin, 1840.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times interest has been renewed, with a new scholarly edition with translation and commentary published in 1983.

==Descendants==
{{main|David ben Judah Messer Leon}}
Following on from his father, Messer Leon's son also became a noted rabbi, physician and author, and defender of the value of the secular disciplines of the Renaissance to Jewish philosophy culture and study. David became best known for his ''Ein ha-Kore'' (''Eye of the Reader''), a sympathetic commentary on [[Maimonides]]' ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]''; and posthumously for his ''Tehillah le-Dawid'' (''Glory to David''), an encyclopedic summary of Jewish philosophy, edited by his grandson Aaron ben Judah (Constantinople, 1577).

'''Latitudinarianism''', in at least one area of [[contemporary philosophy]], is a position concerning [[De dicto and de re|''de dicto'' and ''de re'']] (propositional) [[Propositional attitude| attitudes]].  Latitudinarians think that ''de re'' attitudes are not a category distinct from ''de dicto'' attitudes; the former are just a special case of the latter.

The term was introduced into discussions of ''de dicto'' and ''de re'' attitudes by [[Roderick Chisholm]] in his "Knowledge and Belief: 'De Dicto' and 'De Re'" (1976). Latitudinarianism has since also sometimes been called an "unrestricted exportation" view.

[[Image:Samuel Clarke.jpg|thumb|Samuel Clarke.]]
The '''Leibniz–Clarke correspondence''' was a [[scientific]], [[theological]] and [[philosophical]] [[debate]] conducted in an exchange of letters between the [[Germany|German]] thinker [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], an [[England|English]] supporter of [[Isaac Newton]] during the years 1715 and 1716.  The exchange began because of a letter Leibniz wrote to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], in which he remarked that Newtonian physics was detrimental to [[natural theology]].  Eager to defend the Newtonian view, Clarke responded, and the correspondence continued until the death of Leibniz in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a variety of subjects is touched on in the letters, the main interest for modern readers is in the dispute between the [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] theory of [[space]] favoured by Newton and Clarke, and Leibniz's [[Relational space|relational]] approach.  Also important is the conflict between Clarke's and Leibniz's opinions on [[free will]] and whether God must create the [[best of all possible worlds]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz had published only a book on moral matters, the ''[[Theodicy|Theodicée]]'' (1710), and his more metaphysical views had never been exposed to a sufficient extent, so the collected letters were met with interest by their contemporaries. The priority dispute between [[Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy|Leibniz and Newton about the calculus]] was still fresh in the public's mind and it was taken as a matter of course that it was Newton himself who stood behind Clarke's replies.

==Editions==
The Leibniz-Clarke letters were first published under Clarke's name in the year following Leibniz' death.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collection of Papers, which passed between the late Learned Mr. Leibniz, and Dr. Clarke, In the Years 1715 and 1716'', by Samuel Clarke D.D. (London:  James Knapton, 1717)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a preface, took care of the translation from French, added notes and some of his own writing. In 1720 [[Pierre Desmaizeaux]] published a similar volume in a French translation,&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil de pièces diverses sur la philosophie la religion et l'histoire par Leibniz, Clarke et Newton'', publiées par Pierre Desmaizeaux, Amsterdam, 1720&lt;/ref&gt; including quotes from Newton's work. It is quite certain that for both editions the opinion of Newton himself has been sought and Leibniz left at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoloni-Melli D., ''Newton and the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'',  The Cambridge Companion to Newton,   eds. I. B. Cohen and G. E. Smith, Cambridge University Press,  2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the German translation of the correspondence published by Kohler, also in 1720,&lt;ref&gt;''Merckwurdige Schriften welche . . . zwischen dem Herrn Baron von Leibniz und dem Herrn D. Clarke über besondere Materien der naturlichen Religion'' in Franzos. und Englischer Sprache gewechselt und . . . in teutscher Sprache herausgegeben worden von Heinrich Kohler, Frankfurt and Leipzig (Jena), 1720: there was a preface by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and a reply to Clarke's last letter in  behalf of Leibniz by Ludwig Philipp Thümmig; it appeared also in the latin translation from 1740.&lt;/ref&gt; contained a reply to Clarke's last letter which Leibniz had not been able to answer. The letters have been reprinted in most collections of Leibniz' works and regularly published in stand alone editions.&lt;ref&gt;A full list is given in Alexander H., ''The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence'',  with extracts from Newton's ''Principia'' and ''Opticks'', edited with an introduction and notes, Manchester, 1955 (and reeditions); for a more recent edition see e.g.

'''Linji Yixuan''' ({{zh|t=臨濟義玄|s=临济义玄|p=Línjì Yìxuán|w=Lin-chi I-hsüan}}; {{lang-ja|臨済義玄}} ''Rinzai Gigen''; died 866 CE) was the founder of the [[Linji school]] of [[Chan Buddhism]] during [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]].

==Línjì yǔlù==
{{See also|Linji school}}

Information on Linji is based on the ''Línjì yǔlù'' (臨濟語錄; Japanese: ''Rinzai-goroku''), the Record of Linji. The standard form of these sayings was not completed until 250 years after Linji's death and likely reflect the teaching of Chán in the Linji school at the beginning of the [[Song Dynasty]] rather than those of Linji's in particular.{{sfn|Welter|Year unknown}}

This  contains stories of his interactions with teachers, contemporaries, and students. The recorded lectures are a mixture of the conventional and the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]. Despite the iconoclasm, the ''Línjì yǔlù'' reflects a thorough knowledge of the sutras. Linji's teaching-style, as recorded in the ''Línjì yǔlù'', was exemplary of the development Chán took in the [[Hongzhou school]] (洪州宗) of [[Mazu Daoyi|Mazu]] and his successors, such as [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huangbo]], Linji's master.

==Biography==
According to the ''Línjì yǔlù'', Linji was born into a family named Xing (邢) in Caozhou (modern [[Heze]] in [[Shandong]]), which he left at a young age to study Buddhism in many places.

Also according to the ''Línjì yǔlù'', Linji was trained by the Chan master [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huángbò Xīyùn]] (黃蘗希運), but attained [[kensho]] while discussing Huángbò's teaching during a conversation with the reclusive monk Dàyú (大愚). Linji then returned to Huángbò to continue his training after awakening. In 851 CE, Linji moved to the Linji temple in [[Hebei]], where he took his name, which also became the name for the lineage of his form of Chán Buddhism.

==Linji's teaching style==
[[Image:A statue of Linji Yixuan.JPG|right|thumb|A statue of Linji Yixuan under the southern gate of [[Zhengding]] [[Hebei]], [[China]]]]
{{main|Zen|Chinese Chán}}

===Iconoclasm===
Linji is reputed for being iconoclastic, leading students to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]] by hitting and shouting.{{sfn|McRae|1993}}

===Three Mysterious Gates===
Chán faced [[Zen#Zen teachings|the challenge of expressing its teachings]] of [[Tathātā/Dharmatā|"suchness"]] without getting stuck into words or concepts. The alleged use of shouting and beating was instrumental in this non-conceptual expression - after the students were well-educated in the Buddhist tradition.{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=245-246}}

Linji is described as using ''The Three Mysterious Gates'' to maintain the Chán emphasis on the nonconceptual nature of reality, while employing sutras and teachings to instruct his students:{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=245-246}}
# The First Gate is the "mystery in the essence",{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=246}} the use of Buddhist philosophy, such as [[Yogacara]] to explain the [[Buddhist philosophy#Huayan and Avatamsaka-sutra|interpenetration]] of all phenomena.
# The Second Gate is the "mystery in the word",{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=246}} using the [[Hua Tou]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Stuart Lachs: "The Chinese term Hua-t’ou can be translated as “critical phrase.” Literally it means the “head of speech” or the “point beyond which speech exhausts itself.” In Korean, hua-t’ou are known as hwadu and in Japanese as wato [...] A hua-t’ou is a short phrase (sometimes a part of a koan) that can be taken as a subject of meditation and introspection to focus the mind in a particular way, which is conducive to enlightenment.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://zennist.typepad.com/files/lachszen_2012_02_11.docx.pdf Stuart Lachs (2012), ''Hua-t’ou : A Method of Zen Meditation'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} for "the process of gradually disentangling the students from the conceptual workings of the mind".{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=246}}
# The Third Gate is the "mystery in the mystery",{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=246}} "involving completely nonconceptual expressions such as striking or shouting, which are intended to remove all of the defects implicit in conceptual understanding".{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=246}}

==References in popular culture==
The titular story of Volume 2 of [[Kazuo Koike]] &amp; [[Goseki Kojima]]'s [[manga]] comic [[Lone Wolf and Cub]] revolves around Linji's saying "if you meet a buddha, kill the buddha," in which the protagonist must overcome his self to assassinate a living buddha.

In the manga [[Saiyuki (manga)|Gensōmaden Saiyūki]] by [[Kazuya Minekura]], [[Genjo Sanzo|Genjō Sanzō]] purports to live by the concept of "無一物 (''muichimotsu'')," as taught by his teacher Sanzō Kōmyō, who is quoted as saying:

'''Max Adler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|d|l|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adler "Adler"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈaːdlɐ|lang}}; 15 January 1873 &amp;ndash; 28 June 1937) was an Austrian jurist, politician and [[Social philosophy|social philosopher]]; his theories were of central importance to [[Austromarxism]]. He was a brother of [[Oskar Adler]].

== Life ==
Max Adler obtained his doctorate in law in 1896, and became a professional lawyer. He began to teach in the “Schönbrunn Circle” in the early summer of 1919. Max Winter, the deputy mayor of Vienna, was able to make rooms available in the main building of Schönbrunn Castle for the ''Kinderfreunde Österreich'' (an Austrian association for children and families). In the ''Schönbrunner Erzieherschule'', where young people were trained to be teachers, Max Adler and his colleagues [[Wilhelm Jerusalem]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Marianne Pollak]], [[Josef Luitpold Stern]] and [[Otto Felix Kanitz]] were able to realize practical educational reforms. In 1920 he qualified at [[Vienna University]], where he became Extraordinary Professor of [[Sociology]] and [[Social philosophy]]. From 1919 to 1921 he was a Social-Democratic member of the regional parliament of [[Niederösterreich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag-noe.at/service/politik/landtag/Abgeordnete/ZAbgA/Adler-M.pdf landtag-noe.at]&lt;/ref&gt; Adler was active in Adult Education, and from 1904 to 1925, with [[Rudolf Hilferding]], editor of ''"Marx-Studien"''.

== Works ==
[[File:Adler - Sozialistische Idee der Befreiung bei Karl Marx, 1918 - 5172958.tif|thumb|''Sozialistische Idee der Befreiung bei [[Karl Marx]]'', 1918]]
Max Adler’s first theoretical work of note was a study ''"Max Stirner. Ein Beitrag zur Feststellung des Verhältnisses von Socialismus und Individualismus"'' (1894). The title sets the agenda for Adler’s later theoretical activities. Although this study of Marx’s scorned opponent seriously antagonized [[Marxism|Marxist]] Party theorists, and so remained unpublished, [[Max Stirner|Stirner]] remained an influence on Adler’s thinking throughout his life. Adler’s biographer Alfred Pfabigan, upon sight of his unpublished papers, was surprised by his “intellectual relationship with Stirner owing to its high degree of continuity”.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Pfabigan: ''Max Adler''. Frankfurt/Main: Campus 1982, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Adler wanted to operate within the framework of the rising [[Social democracy|Social Democratic]] movement, he was highly circumspect in his subsequent references to Stirner, and, while continuing to accord him great significance as Marx’s “psychological counterpart”, initially adopted most aspects of the doctrine of [[Historical materialism|Historical Materialism]]: the essence of history is class struggle, and its realization entails a union of theory with revolutionary practice. He envisaged “ever greater harmony and perfection” arising from the contradictions inherent in the then state of society, until the proletariat, in the course of its revolution, would finally see “the pursuit of its own class interests” coincide with “the solidarity of society”. In a departure from [[orthodox Marxism]], Adler’s conception reduces the [[dialectic]] to a mere sociological methodology, not expressive of any specific dialectic intrinsic to the historical process. In common with other theorists of the [[Second International]], such as [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], Adler also rejects the association between [[Scientific Socialism]] and [[Materialism]]: true Marxism was “in reality social idealism“. For Adler, [[Historical materialism|Historical Materialism]] essentially becomes [[subjective idealism]]. In all consistency, his particular interest then turned to producing an epistemological critique of [[Sociology]], combining Marxist themes with [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[transcendentalism]]. According to Adler, “the individual consciousness is a priori socialized”, insofar as every logical judgement already and necessarily includes reference to a multitude of assenting subjects; Adler’s ‘social a priori’ transcendentally implies the possibility of social reality.

Adler’s contributions to a Marxist general theory of the state emerged in the course of disputes with [[Hans Kelsen]] and [[Hermann Heller (Jurist)|Hermann Heller]]. Criticizing the formal concept of [[democracy]], Adler distinguished between political democracy, as a manifestation of the hegemony of the bourgeoisie, and a social democracy, in which oppression was to be removed along with social differences, the whole to be replaced by “solidarity-based administrative reform” of society. For Adler, the establishment of a socialist society remained linked to the ‘dismantling of the machinery of the state’ along Marxist lines. Adler the politician permitted no compromises with the so-called "[[social chauvinism]]", or majority-Socialist “[[reformism]]”. Not the least important aspect of the [[Austromarxism]] espoused by Adler, [[Otto Bauer]] and [[Rudolf Hilferding]] was its relevance to the discussions on the left wing of German Social Democracy before 1933.

'''Mircea Florian''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈmirt͡ʃe̯a floriˈan|lang}}; April 1, 1888 – October 31, 1960) was a [[Romania]]n philosopher and translator. Active mainly during the [[interwar period]], he was noted as one of the leading proponents of [[rationalism]], opposing it to the ''[[Trăirism|Trăirist]]'' philosophy of [[Nae Ionescu]]. His work, comprising some 20 books, shows Florian as a disciple of [[Centrism|centrists]] and rationalists such as [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]] and [[Titu Maiorescu]].

Active in independent [[Social democracy|social democratic]] politics, the philosopher became a political prisoner under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. It was during his time in jail that Florian conceived his philosophical system, published after his death in the treatise ''Recesivitatea ca structură a lumii'' ("Recessivity as World Structure"). In 1990, he was made a posthumous [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Bucharest]], Florian graduated from the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy at the [[University of Bucharest|local university]], where he became a disciple of Rădulescu-Motru and [[P. P. Negulescu]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"&gt;{{ro icon}} Oana-Georgiana Enăchescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/mircea_florian_-_nedreptatea_unui_destin "Mircea Florian - nedreptatea unui destin"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 13/2002&lt;/ref&gt; He afterward took his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Greifswald]], in the [[German Empire]], with a thesis on [[Henri Bergson]]'s notion of time.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; In later years, he found employment as a Bucharest University assistant and substitute professor, lecturing in the History of Philosophy. He was a [[Docent]] from 1916.&lt;ref name="lb(10)350"&gt;Boia (2010), p.350&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], Florian served in the [[Romanian Land Forces]] and was taken prisoner by the [[German Empire|Germans]]. He was transported to an internment camp at [[Krefeld]], alongside figures such as [[Alexandru D. Strurdza]] and [[Ilie Moscovici]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin C. Gomboș, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/insemnari-prizonieratul-german "Însemnări din prizonieratul german"], in ''Historia'', May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Florian was freed by his captors and allowed to lecture at [[Fundațiile Regale|King Carol Foundation]] in Bucharest, under a [[Romania in World War I|German occupation government]]. As Florian later indicated, this was made possible by the intercession of a [[Germanophile]] scholar, [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], who vouched for him, and by the protection of [[Constantin Giurescu]].&lt;ref name="lb(10)350"/&gt; Following the [[First Armistice at Compiègne|November Armistice]], which reinstated the pro-[[Allies of World War I|Allied]] government, Florian, Tzigara-Samurcaș and Rădulescu-Motru were all subject to an official inquiry, and accused of being [[Collaborationism|collaborators]]. The University Commissions created for this task were largely ineffective, and, among the incriminated, Florian was one of few who presented himself for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), p.347-356&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the war, Florian was in contact with ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'', Rădulescu-Motru's magazine, and went on its conference tour, alongside in various cities by, among others, Nae Ionescu, [[Cora Irineu]], [[Octav Onicescu]], [[Virgil Bărbat]], and [[Emanoil Bucuța]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/memoriile_unui_hedonist "Memoriile unui hedonist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 41/2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, in later years, he remained largely cut off from his public: said to have been shy in delivering his lectures, he led a private life, and dedicated himself, almost entirely, to research.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

He wrote a large body of works over a short time, including such titles as: ''Îndrumare în filosofie'' ("Philosophical Companion"), ''Rostul și utilitatea filosofiei'' ("The Purpose and Use of Philosophy"), ''Știință și raționalism'' ("Science and Rationalism"), ''Cosmologia elenă'' ("Hellenic Cosmology"), ''Antinomiile credinței'' ("The [[Antinomy|Antinomies]] of Faith"), ''Kant și criticismul până la Fichte'' ("[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the Critical Method before [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]"), ''Cunoaștere și existență'' ("Knowledge and Being"), ''Reconstrucție filosofică'' ("Philosophical Reconstruction"), ''Metafizică și artă'' ("Metaphysics and Art"), ''Misticism și credință'' ("Mysticism and Faith").&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; Although absorbed by his academic work, Florian affiliated with social democracy, and was a member of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic Party]], the [[Constantin Titel Petrescu]] wing.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

Florian's philosophy developed from ideas common to both Rădulescu-Motru and the 19th-century thinker [[Titu Maiorescu]], herald of Romania's moderate and critical approach to philosophy. Florian is therefore ranked among the third-generation "Maiorescans", and seen as reactivating the spirit of Maiorescu's literary club ''[[Junimea]]''.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zopasionanta"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/o_pasionant_carte_de_filosofie "O pasionantă carte de filosofie"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/1999&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]], the ''Junimist'' legacy came in direct contradiction with Nae Ionescu's critique of rationalism, which was growing in popularity and lending its support to the [[far right]]'s causes.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; Florian's steady opposition to Ionescu, in both concept and method, has been described as the "dualism" of interwar [[Romanian philosophy]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

By the time of [[World War II]], Mircea Florian was still pursuing a debate with the two schools of irrationalism, promoted by [[Lucian Blaga]] and [[Constantin Noica]]. Granted a full professorship in 1940, he was presented for Romanian Academy membership by his mentor Rădulescu-Motru, but the proposal failed to gather support.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; Blaga gave poor reviews to his work in ''Saeculum'' magazine, and, in one (disputed) interpretation, may have portrayed him as the unknown adversary in the virulent lampoon ''Săpunul filozofic'' ("Philosophic Soap", 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florian Roatiș, [http://www.romlit.ro/despre_polemica_blaga-motru "Despre polemica Blaga-Motru"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 4/2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[Z. Ornea]], Florian's relative lack of exposure is unfair, since his works may rank better than those of either Noica or Blaga.&lt;ref name="zopasionanta"/&gt; Florian was also an adversary of official [[fascism]], before and during the [[Ion Antonescu]] dictatorship. Like [[Grigore T. Popa]], [[Constantin I. Parhon]], [[Alexandru Rosetti]], [[Mihai Ralea]], and several other academics, he was in contact with the underground [[Romanian Communist Party]] and the [[Union of Patriots (Romania)|Union of Patriots]], and, as such, kept under close surveillance by the ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' agents.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2012), p.236-237&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian's stance, and especially his commitment to independent social democracy, made him a suspect upon the establishment of Romania's communist regime. As noted by researcher Victor Frunză, Florian and [[Alexandru Claudian]] made a "high sacrifice" when they refused to give in to "blackmail" and would not join the "Workers' Party" (as the Communist Party styled itself upon its absorption of Social Democratic sympathizers).&lt;ref&gt;Victor Frunză, ''Istoria stalinismului în România'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1990, p.274.  {{ISBN|973-28-0177-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, he was stripped of his university chair.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2012), p.302&lt;/ref&gt; Placed under constant surveillance by the [[Securitate]], Romania's new secret police, he was soon after arrested. During his eight-month-long imprisonment without trial, he had the revelation on "recessivity as world structure".&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; The new system evidenced that Florian had come to criticize some of the basic assumptions in [[Western philosophy]], and conceiving of the world through the teachings of [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; His system divided existence alongside its two, equal but alternating, attributes: the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] trait tempered by the recessive (albeit not degraded) one; violence to love, rational to irrational, [[nationalism]] to [[supranationalism]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

The imprisonment is said to have been a grueling experience: allegedly, his wife Angela no longer recognized him upon his return to the family home.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; A while after, Florian was partly reintegrated into academia, and assigned a researcher's position at the Institute of Philosophy. There, he dedicated himself to translating [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'', while in committing his ''Recesivitatea'' to paper in his spare time.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

''Recesivitatea'' was only published 23 years after Florian's death, with [[Editura Eminescu]]. Reportedly, the text had suffered cuts and interventions by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; Florian's role was reconsidered mainly after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], when he was made a posthumous member of the Academy.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; His full work was recovered for the public and reviewed by philosopher [[Mircea Flonta]], in a 1998 volume of essays.&lt;ref name="zopasionanta"/&gt;

'''Neo-Hasidism''' is a name given to contemporary Jewish trends of a significant fusing or revival of interest in the teachings of [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidism]] by members of other existing Jewish movements. Among non-Orthodox Jews, this trend stems from the writings of non-Orthodox teachers of Hasidic Judaism like [[Martin Buber]], [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]],  [[Lawrence Kushner]], [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]] and [[Arthur Green]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jewish History and Thought: An Introduction|first=Menahem|last= Mansoor|publisher=KTAV Publishing House|year=1991|ISBN=0-88125-404-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually associated with the members of the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement. A second form of this trend is found within the [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] Jewish community, and is referred to as '''Neo-Chassidus''', involving those who are Modern Orthodox but have taken interest in the works of Hasidic masters.&lt;ref name=barb/&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[Martin Buber]] helped initiate interest in Hasidism among modernized Jews through a series of books he wrote in the first decades of the 20th century, such as ''Tales of the Hasidic Masters'' and the ''Legend of the Baal Shem Tov''. In these books, Buber focused on the role of story telling and the charisma of early Hasidic masters as a vehicle for personal spirituality. As such, these books represent one aspect of Buber's larger project of creating a new form of personalistic, [[Existentialism|existential]] religiosity. Buber came under considerable criticism, especially from younger contemporary [[Gershom Scholem]], for having interpreted Hasidism in an eccentric way that misrepresented Hasidic belief and literature. Nevertheless, Buber's sympathetic treatment of Hasidism proved attractive to many and started the 20th century romance between (idealized) Hasidism and non-Orthodox Jews.

==Post-World War II==
{{Jewish mysticism}}
Following [[World War II]], when the Hasidic centers of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] were decimated, some of the surviving communities relocated to America, creating new opportunities for [[the USA|America]]n Jews to have direct experience with them, their practices and their beliefs. Most of these communities remained determinedly insular, but a few, primarily the [[Chabad-Lubavitch|Chabad]] and [[Bratslav]] (or Breslov) Hasidim, adopted an attitude of outreach to the larger Jewish community, seeking to win more Jews to the Hasidic way of life. In the 1960s the [[Lubavitcher]] [[Rebbe]] ([[Menachem Mendel Shneerson]]) started commissioning young Chabadniks to seek out and teach young secular and religiously liberal Jews. Two of the early "shluchim" were [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]] and [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]]. While Carlebach, a charismatic [[singer]] who used music as his tool, stayed (largely) within the circle of the Orthodox community from which he arose, Schachter-Shalomi charted an increasingly independent course, leaving Chabad to eventually study at [[Hebrew Union College (HUC)]], the leading academic institution of [[Reform Judaism]], and to found what became [[Jewish Renewal]]. 

Equally important was [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], a [[Holocaust]] refugee and scion of Hasidic royalty, who began his academic career in America with a life-saving but difficult wartime stint at HUC. In 1946, he moved to the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], the intellectual center for [[Conservative Judaism]]. There he still found himself marginalized for his Hasidic interests and customs, yet he surrounded himself with a small circle of devoted students (and eventual congregational [[rabbis]]) drawn to his mystically flavored phenomenology. As the 1960s began, Heschel was achieving increasing recognition as a theologian of stature with the publication of his books ''[[God in Search of Man]]'' and ''The Prophets.'' With that fame came an interest in his Hasidic roots and their role in his teachings. His [[social activism]] in the 60s and 70s further endeared him to many young Jews.

==1960s and 1970s==
Several of Heschel's students at JTS during the turbulent 60's and early 70's eventually became involved in the embryonic [[Chavurah|Havurah]] movement, a loosely defined project of creating an alternative, informal type of Jewish community first proposed by Reform theologian Jakob Petuchowski in the 1960s. While the movement spanned a broad spectrum of spiritual proclivities, some Jews in the founding circles, like [[Arthur Waskow]], [[Arthur Green]], and [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], under the combined influence of Heschel and Schachter-Shalomi, took up the project of further exploring Hasidism and recasting it in an American idiom. [[Havurat Shalom]], the flagship of this experimental quasi-communal movement which was started jointly by Green and Schachter-Shalomi in Boston, produced the greatest artifact of Havurah Judaism, the ''[[Jewish Catalog]]'' series, a set of three books devoted to "do-it-yourself" Judaism, written with a healthy dose of information and enthusiasm for things Hasidic. In general, the Havurah communities most influenced by Hasidism were also influenced by Kabbalah, and it remains the case that these interests overlap in most of what can be labeled neo-Hasidic.

These future "Neo-Hasids" focused on selected attractive aspects of traditional Hasidism while rejecting those Hasidic teachings they found incompatible with their modern egalitarian commitments, such as Hasidism's attitudes toward women, sexuality, and non-Jews. A few of these devotees, like Waskow and Lerner, became writers of note and "public square" intellectuals in the Jewish community and in the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement. Others, such as Green and Lawrence Fine, became leading scholars in the Jewish academic world, bringing an appreciation of Hasidism and an interest in adapting its ideas and customs to contemporary mores and life. Through books like ''Tormented Master,'' ''The Language of Truth'' and ''Your Word Is Fire,'' Green (and others) made Hasidism both more accessible and compelling for Jews seeking personal spirituality amidst the outwardly focused and sometimes spiritually dry world of the formal American Jewish community. Among the liberal movements, the Reform community remained resistant to this trend for a longer period, but a few rabbis, such as [[Herbert Weiner]] and [[Lawrence Kushner]], also started "translating" Hasidism into a Reform idiom, expanding its influence. 

This overlapping of amorphous interest in Hasidism among academics, seekers, religious functionaries,  intellectuals, "alternative" rabbis and teachers, has led to the coining of the term "Neo-Hasidism (NH)." {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A few formalized groups and institutions, such as P'nai Or congregation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Elat Chayyim Retreat Center in Falls Village, CT, are heavily influenced by NH. NH also enjoyed a period of pre-eminence at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Seminary (RRC) during Arthur Green's tenure there as dean.

==1980s-present==
In 2004 a conference on Neo-Hasidism was held in NYC, organized by Rabbi Natan Margalit, under the aegis of the Institute for Jewish Spirituality. At that conference there was a call by Arthur Green and others to "solidify" and in some way institutionalize the movement and its teachings so that it may survive the eventual passing of its first generation of luminaries. To some degree this has been achieved through the establishment of Green's post-denominational rabbinical school at Boston's Hebrew College. Neo-Hasidism continues to develop in projects like NeoHasid.org on the internet and in egalitarian minyanim (prayer groups) that define themselves in terms of Hasidism like the Shtibl minyan in Los Angeles.

==In Modern Orthodoxy==
In the past several years, some men and women brought up in the modern-Orthodox world began exploring the texts and way of life of Chasidic masters. Most notable are the Chabad works and the writings of Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]]. Current Neo-Hasidic outposts include The Stollel with locations in New Jersey and New York and The University of Purim (UofPurim) located in New York (main Campus), Los Angeles (UofPurimWest), and Tucson (UofPurimSouthwest). Rabbi [[Moshe Weinberger]], founding rabbi of [[Congregation Aish Kodesh]] in [[Woodmere, New York]], is widely considered the "senior spokesman" of the Neo-Hasidic movement in Modern Orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=barb&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/12/2014/rekindling-flame-neo-chassidus-brings-inner-light-torah-modern-orthodoxy/|title= Rekindling the Flame: Neo-Chassidus Brings the Inner Light of Torah to Modern Orthodoxy|first=Barbara |last=Bensoussan| date=1 December 2014|accessdate=24 July 2016|journal=[[Jewish Action]]|publisher=[[Orthodox Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
"Fortunately, [[Christianity]] is neither [[Platonism]] nor [[Stoicism]]. Everything in our body and soul is created by God, and as such, absolutely sacred. It is up to my own freedom to get angry, fall in love, play, create, eat, rejoice, be sorrowful, in such a manner that will bring me continuously closer to the Divine Source of my being: this is the meaning of the [[Incarnation]]. God does not call me to escape from this world, but to transform it into a place of His manifestation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=We put phantasies about Power and Dominion in the Place of God - Georgios Kiousis interviews Father Nikolaos Loudovikos | publisher=Eleftherotypia | date=2008-04-23 |  accessdate=2009-02-22 | language=Greek | last=Kiousis | first=Georgios |url=http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,dt=23.04.2008,id=95738224  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] says: why did the Incarnation happen? So that the [[Son of God]] could be punished in the place of man. [[Gregory the Theologian]] says: the Incarnation happened, 'because humanity must be sanctified by the Humanity of God'. Quite the opposite, in other words. And the Theologian continues: the only thing God wants, is to stop decay. Now try and build [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]] on a position such as that of the [[Greek Fathers]]! It is impossible. That's why many of my fellow students in France marvelled at us Greeks, saying: «vous êtes anarchistes» (you are anarchists)!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Let's not Lose the Passions.

==Early life and education==
Born at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] in London, Olivia Robertson was descended from the theologian [[Richard Graves (theologian)|Richard Graves]], a cousin of the author [[Robert Graves]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philhine.org.uk/writings/ess_olivia.html "An Interview with Olivia Durdin-Robertson"]. ''Pagan News'', August 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.controverscial.com/Robert%20Graves.htm Robert Graves and Olivia Robertson], Controverscial.Com&lt;/ref&gt; and was a grandchild of [[Thomas Herbert Robertson]]. She was the second of four children born to Nora and Manning Durdin-Robertson, an architect and town planner and a friend of the poet [[W. B. Yeats]]. Her family lived in [[Reigate]] in Surrey before moving back to their ancestral home [[Huntington Castle, Clonegal|Huntington Castle]] in Ireland, which had been inherited in 1925 on the death of her grandmother. From 1938 Robertson was educated at [[Heathfield School, Ascot]] and the [[Grosvenor School of Modern Art]].

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], although a [[pacifist]] she served as a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|V.A.D.]] nurse in Bedfordshire in 1940. She studied at [[University College Dublin]] in 1942, and then worked at [[Dublin Corporation]] until 1946. In 1946 she published her first book, ''St. Malachy's Court''. Further books followed, including ''Field of the Stranger'' (1948), which was awarded the London Book Society's Choice award; ''The Golden Eye'' (1949), ''Miranda Speaks'' (1950), and ''It's an Old Irish Custom'' (1954). Her book ''The Dublin Phoenix'' (1956) sold out on its first day.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.fellowshipofisis.com/oliviarobertson.html "Olivia Robertson"]. Fellowship of Isis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Huntington Castle==
In 1960 Robertson moved back to Huntington Castle, the family home, with her brother, Lawrence Durdin-Robertson, and his wife Pamela. In 1963 she formed the Huntington Castle Centre for Meditation and Study with them. In 1976 the [[Fellowship of Isis]] (FOI) was founded.

'''Omnibenevolence''' (from [[Latin]] ''omni-'' meaning "all", ''bene-'' meaning "good" and ''volens'' meaning "willing") is defined by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as "unlimited or infinite [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]]". Some philosophers have argued that it is impossible, or at least improbable, for a deity to exhibit such a property alongside [[omniscience]] and [[omnipotence]], as a result of the [[problem of evil]]. However, some philosophers, such as [[Alvin Plantinga]], argue the plausibility of [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|co-existence]]. The word is primarily used as a technical term within academic literature on the [[philosophy of religion]], mainly in context of the [[problem of evil]] and [[theodicy|theodical]] responses to such. Although even in said contexts the phrases "perfect goodness" or "moral perfection" are often preferred because of the difficulties in defining what exactly constitutes "infinite benevolence".

==Etymology==
"Omnibenevolence" appears to have a very casual usage among some Protestant Christian commentators. The earliest record for its use in English, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is in 1679. The [[Catholic Church]] does not appear to use the term "omnibenevolent" in the [[liturgy]] or [[Catechism]].

Modern users of the term include [[George H. Smith]] in his book ''Atheism: The Case Against God'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Smith | first=George H. | year = 1980 | title=Atheism: The Case Against God | publisher=Prometheus Books | isbn=0-87975-124-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he argued that divine qualities are inconsistent.  However, the term is also used by authors who defend the coherence of divine attributes, including but not limited to, Jonathan Kvanvig in ''The Problem of Hell'' (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Kvanvig | first=Jonathan L. | year=1993 | title=The Problem of Hell | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=4 | isbn=0-19-508487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz in ''The Divine Attributes'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hoffman | first=Joshua |author2=Gary Rosenkrantz | year=2002 | title=The Divine Attributes | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | isbn=0-631-21154-3}} Used throughout the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology has been used by some prominent [[Roman Catholic]] figures, examples being Father [[Robert Barron (priest)|Robert Barron]], [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]] in his 2011 book ''Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Barron (priest)|Robert Barron]]|title=Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith|date=2011|ISBN=0307720519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical perspectives==
The term is patterned on, and often accompanied by, the terms ''[[omniscience]]'' and ''[[omnipotence]]'', typically to refer to conceptions of an "all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful" deity. Philosophers and theologians more commonly use phrases like "perfectly good",&lt;ref&gt;This phrase is used in many notable encyclopedia and dictionary entries, such as:
* {{Cite encyclopedia |first=Michael |last=Tooley |title=The Problem of Evil |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/}}
* {{Cite encyclopedia |first=Simon |last=Blackburn|title=Evil, the Problem of |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply the term "benevolence". The word "omnibenevolence" may be interpreted to mean perfectly just, all-loving, fully merciful, or any number of other qualities, depending on precisely how "good" is understood. As such, there is little agreement over how an "omnibenevolent" being would behave.

The notion of an omnibenevolent, infinitely compassionate deity, has raised certain [[atheist]]ic objections, such as the [[problem of evil]] and the [[problem of hell]]. Responses to such problems are called [[theodicy|theodicies]] and can be general, arguing for the coherence of the divine, such as [[Swinburne]]'s ''Providence and the Problem of Evil'', or they can address a specific problem, such as Charles Seymour's ''A Theodicy of Hell''.

Proponents of [[Pandeism]] contend that benevolence (much less omnibenevolence) is simply not required to account for any property of our Universe, as a morally neutral deity which was powerful enough to have created our Universe as we experience it would be, by definition, able to have created our Universe as we experience it. William C. Lane contended that Pandeism thereby offered an escape from the [[evidential argument from evil]]:&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–84 | doi = | accessdate = 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, author William C. Lane contended that:

{{quote|In pandeism, God is no superintending, heavenly power, capable of hourly intervention into earthly affairs. No longer existing "above," God ''cannot'' intervene from above and cannot be blamed for failing to do so. Instead God ''bears'' all suffering, whether the fawn's&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Rowe|William Rowe]] used, as an example of needless suffering, a fawn horribly burned in a forest fire and unable to move, yet suffering for additional days before its death.&lt;/ref&gt; or anyone else's.

Even so, a skeptic might ask, "Why must there be ''so'' much suffering,? Why could not the world's design omit or modify the events that cause it?" In pandeism, the reason is clear: to remain unified, a world must convey information through transactions. Reliable conveyance requires relatively simple, uniform laws. Laws designed to skip around suffering-causing events or to alter their natural consequences (i.e., their consequences under simple laws) would need to be vastly complicated or (equivalently) to contain numerous exceptions.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;{{rp|76–77}}}}

==Religious perspectives==
Belief in [[God]]'s omnibenevolence is an essential foundation in traditional Christianity; this can be seen in Scriptures such as [[Psalms]] 18:30: "As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him," and Ps.19:7: "The law of the Lord is good, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple."  This understanding is evident in the following statement by the [[First Vatican Council]]{{original research inline|date=November 2011}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church believes and acknowledges that there is one true and living God, Creator and Lord of Heaven and earth, almighty, eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible, infinite in will, understanding and every perfection. Since He is one, singular, completely simple and unchangeable spiritual substance, He must be declared to be in reality and in essence, distinct from the world, supremely happy in Himself and from Himself, and inexpressibly loftier than anything besides Himself which either exists or can be imagined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/20ecume1.htm|title=First Vatican Council|work=dailycatholic.org|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosophical justification stems from God's [[aseity]]: the non-contingent, independent and self-sustained mode of existence that theologians ascribe to God. For if he was not morally perfect, that is, if God was merely a great being but nevertheless of finite benevolence, then his existence would involve an element of contingency, because one could always conceive of a being of greater benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm|title=The infinity of God|work=Catholic Encyclopaedia|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, omnibenevolence is a requisite of perfect being theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perfect Being Theology|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/perfect-being-theology|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologians in the Wesleyan Christian tradition (see [[Thomas Jay Oord]]) argue that omnibenevolence is God's primary [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute]].  As such, God's other attributes should be understood in light of omnibenevolence. Christians believe in the idea of unconditional love.
: ''But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.'' (Romans 5:8 NIV)

Some [[Hyper-Calvinism#Hyper-Calvinism doctrine|Hyper-Calvinist]] interpretations reject omnibenevolence. For example, the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] is infamous for its expression of this stance.

Christian apologist [[William Lane Craig]] argues that Islam does not hold to the idea of omnibenevolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/is-the-islamic-conception-of-god-morally-inadequate|title=Is the Islamic Concept of God Morally Inadequate?|publisher=Reasonable Faith|author=[[William Lane Craig]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], and [[Reformed]] traditions, the Paschal Triduum straddles the two liturgical seasons of [[Lent]] and [[Eastertide|Easter]] in the [[Church calendar]]; however, in the [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, since the [[Pope Pius XII#Liturgy reforms|1955 reform]] by [[Pope Pius XII]], the Easter Triduum has been more clearly distinguished as a separate liturgical period. Previously, all these celebrations were advanced by more than twelve hours. The Mass of the Lord's Supper and the Easter Vigil were celebrated in the morning of Thursday and Saturday respectively, and [[Holy Week]] and [[Lent]] were seen as ending only on the approach of Easter.

After the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] at the Mass of the Lord's Supper all church bells are silenced and the organ is not used. The period that lasted from Thursday morning to before Easter Sunday began was once, in Anglo-Saxon times, referred to as "the still days".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Holy Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the Catholic Church, [[wedding]]s, which were once prohibited throughout the entire season of Lent and during certain other periods as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Banns of Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt; are prohibited during the Triduum. Lutherans still discourage weddings during the entirety of Holy Week and the Easter Triduum.

Some faithful travelled to several churches to pray at each one's Altar of Repose, a practice called [[Seven Churches Visitation]], which now is associated rather with the morning of Good Friday. The Mass included no washing of the feet, which could instead be done in a separate ceremony later in the day. The Mass itself concluded with a ritual [[Stripping of the Altar|stripping]] of all altars except the altar of repose, leaving only the cross and candlesticks. In the present form as revised in 1955, the altar is stripped bare without ceremony at some time after the evening Mass.

==Good Friday==
[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|''[[Ecce Homo]]'' by [[Antonio Ciseri]] (19th century).]]
{{Main|Good Friday}}

On Good Friday, Christians recall the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] and crucifixion of Jesus.

In the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglo-Catholic rites, a cross or crucifix (not necessarily the one that stands on or near the altar on other days of the year) is ceremonially unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Good Friday}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In pre-1955 services, other crucifixes were to be unveiled, without ceremony, after the Good Friday service.)  In the Catholic ritual, [[clergy]] traditionally begin the service [[prostration|prostrate]] in front of the altar. Mass is not celebrated on Good Friday and the communion distributed at the Celebration of the Lord's Passion is consecrated on Holy Thursday, hence the pre-1955 name "Mass of the Presanctified". In Anglican churches, there is no prayer of consecration on Good Friday, and the Reserved Sacrament is distributed at services on that day.  Also in Catholicism, images of saints may, in accordance with local custom, be veiled throughout the last two weeks of Lent. Votive lights before these images are not lit. Crucifixes that are movable are hidden, while those that are not movable are veiled until after the Good Friday service.&lt;ref name=veiling&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur72.htm Covering of Crosses and Images in Lent]&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic faithful typically venerate the crucifix by kissing the feet of the corpus. Veneration of a simple wooden cross is common in Anglican worship, with the faithful touching or kissing it.

Colors of vestments (and hangings, if kept) vary: no color, red, or black are used in different traditions. The Catholic Church uses red vestments, symbolic of the blood of Jesus Christ, but in the pre-1970 form of the [[Roman Missal]] the priest wears black, changing to violet for the communion part of the service. In Anglican services, [[black vestments]] are sometimes used. In [[The United Methodist Church]], black is the liturgical colour used on Good Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=do7TAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=liturgical+colors+Good+Friday+United+Methodist+Methodist&amp;dq=liturgical+colors+Good+Friday+United+Methodist+Methodist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=agl6T-qZNcbc0QHTltmZDQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwBg|title=Christian Advocate, Volume 5|publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]]|year=1961|quote=The liturgical color for the Lenten season is violet or purple, except for Good Friday when black is used.|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Lutheran]] churches, there is no liturgical color on Good Friday.  Altars remain stripped and clergy wear no vestments on this day.

==Holy Saturday==
[[File:Resurrection.JPG|thumb|250px|''Jesus Resurrected'' by [[Piero della Francesca]] (15th century).]] 

Also called Black Saturday, is a vigil service that is held after nightfall on Holy Saturday, or before dawn on Easter Sunday, in celebration of the [[resurrection of Jesus]]. Many of the details that follow hold for Anglican and Evangelical Lutheran churches as well as Catholic worship.  The ceremony of darkness and light is held at the beginning of the [[Easter Vigil]] Mass. The [[paschal candle]], whose lighting symbolizes the resurrection of Christ from the dead,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/FAQs/Paschal-Candle.aspx How do we use a paschal candle]&lt;/ref&gt; is lit from the new Easter fire. The solemn procession to the altar with the Paschal candle is formed. Once everyone has processed in, the [[Exsultet]] is intoned.

After the Exsultet, everyone is seated and listens to seven readings from the [[Old Testament]] and seven [[Psalms]]. At least three of these readings and associated psalms must be read, which must include the account of the first [[Passover]] from the [[Book of Exodus]]. [[pastoral care|Pastoral]] conditions are taken into account when deciding on the number of readings.&lt;ref name="Catholic culture"&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=1043 Catholic Culture] accessed 12 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USCCB&gt;[http://www.nccbuscc.org/liturgy/eastervigil.shtml United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]. Accessed 12 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CL Vigil"&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/327/Start/319 Catholic Liturgy, Easter Sunday of the Lord's Resurrection, The Easter Vigil]. Accessed 12 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These readings account salvation history, beginning with Creation. In Anglican worship, there are nine possible readings from the [[Old Testament]], and a minimum of two must be read, which must include the account of Israel's deliverance at the Red Sea.

In Catholic practice, during the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] at the Mass, the organ and church bells are used in the liturgy for the first time in two days.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic City  [http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/h/holy_week.html Tenbrae] Retrieved on April 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  If the lights of the Church have been previously left off, they are turned on as the Gloria begins. The Paschal candle is used to bless the [[baptismal font]] to be used in the celebration of the sacrament.  The Great Alleluia is sung before the Gospel is read, [[Alleluia]] being used for the first time since before Lent. People receiving full initiation in the Church, who have completed their training, are given the Sacraments of [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|Christian initiation]] ([[Baptism]], [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|confirmation]], and the [[Holy Eucharist]]). In Catholic and Anglican tradition, the Easter Vigil is an especially appropriate day for Holy Baptism.

In current practice, the use of lighting to signify the emergence from [[sin]] and the resurrection of Jesus varies, from the use of candles held by parishioners as well as [[candelabra]]s lit throughout the church.  If statues and images have been veiled during the last two weeks of Lent, they are unveiled, without ceremony, before the Easter Vigil service begins.&lt;ref name=veiling/&gt; (In the 1962 Catholic missal and earlier missals, they are unveiled during the "Gloria in Excelsis" of the Easter Vigil Mass.)

Color of vestments and hangings: white, often together with gold, with yellow and white flowers often in use in many parishes.

Easter Masses are held throughout the day and are similar in content to the Easter Vigil Mass.

==Easter time==
{{Main|Eastertide}}
The date of Easter [[Easter#Date|varies from year to year]]. It occurs on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after 21 March, a date taken, in accordance with an ancient ecclesiastical tradition, to be that of the spring equinox, but which does not always correspond to the astronomical equinox. The [[Julian Calendar]] is taken as the basis of the calculations by nearly all [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and is accepted even by [[Latin Church]] Catholics in countries such as [[Ethiopia]] and [[Greece]].   In the 20th and 21st centuries, the Julian Calendar's 21 March corresponds to 3 April in the [[Gregorian Calendar]], the calendar used for civil purposes in most countries. The earliest possible date for Easter is 22 March, and the latest 25 April. These dates in the Julian Calendar now correspond to the Gregorian Calendar's 4 April and 8 May.

During the Easter [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] (and also during Holy Week) no other feast is celebrated. If Easter is very early, the solemnity of the [[Annunciation]] (25 March) may fall within the octave or Holy Week and is then transferred to the Monday after the octave.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Norms on the Calendar, 60. This is an exception to the normal rule that impeded solemnities are transferred to the closest day not ranked as feast or higher.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter have precedence over all feasts and solemnities, solemnities being then transferred to the following Monday, unless they occur on Palm Sunday or on Sunday of the Lord's Resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Norms on the Calendar, 5&lt;/ref&gt; "The Solemnity of Saint Joseph, where it is observed as a Holyday of Obligation, should it fall on Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion, is anticipated on the preceding Saturday, 18 March. Where, on the other hand, it is not observed as a Holyday of Obligation, it may be transferred by the Conference of Bishops to another day outside Lent."&lt;ref&gt;Universal Norms on the Calendar, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The solemnity of the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] is on the fortieth day of Easter, which is always a Thursday, although it may be observed on the following Sunday. [[Pentecost]] (or [[Whitsun]]) is the fiftieth day.

The Easter season extends from the Easter Vigil through Pentecost Sunday on the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic and Protestant calendars. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar the octave of Pentecost is included in Eastertide, which thus ends at [[None (liturgy)|None]] of the following [[Ember Saturday]].

During the 50-day Easter period, vestments are generally white or gold, but red when celebrating apostles and martyrs and on the solemnity of Pentecost. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar, with its 56-day Eastertide, red was used during the octave of Pentecost.

'''{{IAST|Patañjali}}''' ({{lang-sa|पतञ्जलि}}) is the name of one or more authors of a number of [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] works. A great deal of scholarship has been devoted over the last century or so to the issue of the historicity or identity of this author or these authors.&lt;ref name=NCC&gt;{{cite book|last=Raghavan|first=V.|title=New Catalogus Catalogorum|year=1968|publisher=University of Madras|location=Madras|pages=vol. 11, pp. 89–90|display-authors=etal}} lists ten separate authors by the name of "Patañjali."&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the more important authors called Patañjali are:&lt;ref&gt;Jonardon Ganeri, ''Artha: Meaning'', Oxford University Press 2006, 1.2, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan, and C.A.

* The author of the ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'', an ancient treatise on [[Sanskrit grammar]] and linguistics, based on the ''[[Pāṇini#Ashtadhyayi|Aṣṭādhyāyī]]'' of [[Pāṇini]]. This Patañjali's life is dated to mid 2nd century BCE by both Western and Indian scholars.&lt;ref name="Banerji1989p233"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharf1996p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M.

Some in the Indian tradition have held that one Patañjali wrote treatises on grammar, medicine and yoga. This has been memorialised in a verse by [[Bhoja]] at the start of his commentary on the Yogasutras called ''Rājamārttanda'' (11th century), and the following verse found in Shivarama's 18th-century text:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=1914 | title=The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali | author1=Patañjali | author2=James Haughton Woods (transl.) | publisher=Published for Harvard University by Ginn &amp;amp; Co. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fc4oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP18 | pages=xiv-xv | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|English translation: I bow with my hands together to the eminent sage Patañjali, who removed the impurities of the mind through yoga, of speech through grammar, and of the body through medicine.}}

This tradition is discussed by Meulenbeld&lt;ref name=HIML /&gt; who traces this "relatively late" idea back to [[Bhoja]] (11th century), who was perhaps influenced by a verse by [[Bhartṛhari]] (ca. 5th century) that speaks of an expert in yoga, medicine and grammar who, however, is not named. No known Sanskrit text prior to the 10th century states that the one and the same Patanjali was behind all the three treatises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandramouli S.

In the Yoga tradition, Patañjali is a revered name. This Patañjali's oeuvre comprises the sutras about Yoga (''Yogasūtra'') and the commentary integral to the sutras, called the ''[[Bhashya|Bhāṣya]]''.  Some consider the sutras and the Bhaṣya to have had different authors, the commentary being ascribed to "an editor" (Skt. "vyāsa").  According to Phillipp Maas, the same person named Patanjali composed the sutras and the ''Bhāṣya'' commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maas|first=Philipp. A.|title=Samādhipāda: das erste Kapitel des Pātañjalayogaśāstra zum ersten Mal kritisch ediert| year= 2006|publisher= Shaker|location= Aachen|isbn=3832249877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radhakrishnan and Moore attribute the text to the grammarian Patañjali, dating it as 2nd century [[BCE]], during the [[Maurya Empire]] (322–185 BCE).{{Sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|p=453}} Maas estimates Patañjali's Yogasutra's date to be about 400 CE, based on tracing the commentaries on it published in the first millennium CE.&lt;ref name=maas-sama/&gt; Edwin Bryant, on the other hand, surveys the major commentators in his translation of the ''Yoga Sūtras''.&lt;ref name=bryant-yoga&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Edwin F.|title=The Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali: A New Edition, Translation and Commentary|date=2009|publisher=North Poinnt Press|location=New York|isbn=0865477361}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that "most scholars date the text shortly after the turn of the Common Era (circa first to second century), but that it has been placed as early as several centuries before that."{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=xxxiv}} Bryant concludes that "A number of scholars have dated the ''Yoga Sūtras'' as late as the fourth or fifth century C.E., but these arguments have all been challenged", and late chronology for this Patanjali and his text are problematic.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=510, notes 43-44}}

[[File:Patanjali.jpg|right|upright=0.8|thumb|A garlanded Patanjali statue]]

Regarding his early years, a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Saiva Siddhanta]] tradition from around 10th century AD holds that Patañjali learned Yoga along with seven other disciples from the great Yogic [[Guru]] Nandhi Deva, as stated in [[Tirumular]]'s ''[[Tirumandiram]]'' (Tantra 1).

Whether the two works, the Yoga Sutras and the [[Mahābhāṣya]], are by the same author has been the subject of considerable debate. The authorship of the two is first attributed to the same person in Bhojadeva's ''Rajamartanda'', a relatively late (10th century) commentary on the Yoga Sutras,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali], ed. James Haughton Woods, 1914, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several subsequent texts. As for the texts themselves, the Yoga Sutra iii.44 cites a sutra as that from Patanjali by name, but this line itself is not from the Mahābhāṣya. This 10th-century legend of single-authorship is doubtful.  The literary styles and contents of the Yogasūtras and the Mahābhāṣya are entirely different, and the only work on medicine attributed to Patañjali is lost.  Sources of doubt include the lack of cross-references between the texts, and no mutual awareness of each other, unlike other cases of multiple works by (later) Sanskrit authors.  Also, some elements in the Yoga Sutras may date from as late as the 4th century AD,&lt;ref name=gavin/&gt; but such changes may be due to divergent authorship, or due to later additions which are not atypical in the oral tradition. Most scholars refer to both works as "by Patanjali", without meaning that they are by the same author.

In addition to the Mahābhāṣya and Yoga Sūtras, the 11th-century commentary on [[Charaka]] by the Bengali scholar Cakrapāṇidatta, and the 16th-century text ''Patanjalicarita'' ascribes to Patañjali a medical text called the ''Carakapratisaṃskṛtaḥ'' (now lost) which is apparently a revision (''pratisaṃskṛtaḥ'') of the medical treatise by Caraka.  While there is a short treatise on yoga in the medical work called the Carakasaṃhitā (by Caraka), towards the end of the chapter called śārīrasthāna, it is notable for not bearing much resemblance to the Yoga Sūtras, and in fact presents a form of eightfold yoga that is completely different from that laid out by Patañjali in the Yoga Sūtras and the commentary Yogasūtrabhāṣya.

===Yoga Sūtra===
{{main|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
The ''Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali'' are 196 Indian sutras ([[aphorism]]s) on [[Yoga]]. It was the most translated ancient Indian text in the medieval era, having been translated into about forty Indian languages and two non-Indian languages: [[Old Javanese]] and [[Arabic]].{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}} The text fell into obscurity for nearly 700 years from the 12th to 19th century, and made a comeback in late 19th century due to the efforts of [[Swami Vivekananda]] and others. It gained prominence again as a comeback classic in the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi-xvii}}

Before the 20th century, history indicates the Indian yoga scene was dominated by other Yoga texts such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'' and ''[[Yoga Yajnavalkya]]''.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi-xvii, 20-23}} Scholars consider the ''Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali'' formulations as one of the foundations of classical [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga philosophy]] of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ianwhicher49&gt;Ian Whicher (1998), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, page 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stuartsarbacker195&gt;Stuart Sarbacker (2011), Yoga Powers (Editor: Knut A. Jacobsen), Brill, {{ISBN|978-9004212145}}, page 195&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{IAST|Mahābhāṣya}}===

The {{IAST|[[Mahābhāṣya]]}} ("great commentary") of Patañjali on the {{IAST|[[Aṣṭādhyāyī]]}} of {{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}} is a major early exposition on Pāṇini, along with the somewhat earlier ''Varttika'' by [[Katyayana]]. Patanjali relates to how words and meanings are associated – Patanjali claims ''shabdapramâNaH'' – that the evidentiary value of words is inherent in them, and not derived externally&lt;ref name=watw/&gt; – the word-meaning association is natural. These issues in the word-meaning relation ([[symbol]]) would be elaborated in the [[Sanskrit grammarian|Sanskrit]] linguistic tradition, in debates between the [[Mimamsa]], [[Nyaya]] and [[Buddhist]] schools over the next fifteen centuries.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==== Sphota ====
Patanjali also defines an early notion of [[sphota]], which would be elaborated considerably by later Sanskrit linguists like [[Bhartrihari]].  In Patanjali, a ''sphoTa'' (from ''sphuT'', spurt/burst) is the invariant quality of speech.  The noisy element (''dhvani'', audible part) can be long or short, but the sphoTa remains unaffected by individual speaker differences.   Thus, a single letter or 'sound' (''varNa'') such as ''k'', ''p'' or ''a'' is an abstraction, distinct from variants produced in actual enunciation.&lt;ref name=watw&gt;{{cite book
 | title =        Bimal Krishna Matilal | author =       The word and the world: India's contribution to the study of language  | publisher =    Oxford | year =          1990
 | isbn =        0-19-562515-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been linked to the modern notion of [[phoneme]], the minimum distinction that defines semantically distinct sounds.  Thus a phoneme is an abstraction for a range of sounds.  However, in later writings, especially in Bhartrihari (6th century CE), the notion of ''sphoTa'' changes to become more of a mental state, preceding the actual utterance, akin to the [[Lemma (psycholinguistics)|lemma]].

Patañjali's writings also elaborate some principles of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (''prakriyā'').  In the context of elaborating on Pāṇini's aphorisms, he also discusses [[Kātyāyana]]'s commentary, which are also aphoristic and ''sūtra''-like; in the later tradition, these were transmitted as embedded in Patañjali's discussion.  In general, he defends many positions of Pāṇini which were interpreted somewhat differently in Katyayana.

====Metaphysics as grammatical motivation====
Unlike Pāṇini's objectives in the Ashtyadhyayi, which is to distinguish correct forms and meanings from incorrect ones (''shabdaunushasana''), Patanjali's objectives are more metaphysical.  These include the correct recitations of the scriptures (''Agama''), maintaining the purity of texts (''raksha''), clarifying ambiguity (''asamdeha''), and also the pedagogic goal of providing an easier learning mechanism (''laghu'').&lt;ref name=watw/&gt; This stronger metaphysical bent has also been indicated by some as one of the unifying themes between the Yoga Sutras and the Mahābhāṣya, although a close examination
of actual Sanskrit usage by Woods showed no similarities in language or terminology.

The text of the ''{{IAST|Mahābhāṣya}}'' was first critically edited by the 19th-century orientalist Franz Kielhorn, who also developed [[philological]] criteria for distinguishing Kātyāyana's "voice" from Patañjali's.  Subsequently, a number of other editions have come out, the 1968 text and translation by S.D. Joshi and J.H.F. Roodbergen often being considered definitive. Regrettably, the latter work is incomplete.

Patanjali also writes with a light touch.  For example, his comment on the conflicts between the orthodox Brahminic (''Astika'') groups, versus the heterodox, ''nAstika'' groups ([[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and atheists) seems relevant for religious conflict even today: the hostility between these groups was like that between a [[mongoose]] and a snake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Romila Thapar]], Interpreting Early India. Oxford University Press, 1992, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; He also sheds light on contemporary events, commenting on the recent [[Greeks|Greek]] incursion, and also on several tribes that lived in the Northwest regions of the subcontinent.

===Patanjalatantra===
Patanjali is also the reputed author of a medical text called ''Patanjalah'', also called ''Patanjala'' or ''Patanjalatantra''.&lt;ref name=HIML/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|title=A History of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA231|year=1992|publisher=Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass (Original: Cambridge University Press)|isbn=978-81-208-0412-8|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text is quoted in many yoga and health-related Indian texts. Patanjali is called a medical authority in a number of Sanskrit texts such as ''Yogaratnakara'', ''Yogaratnasamuccaya'', ''Padarthavijnana'', ''Cakradatta bhasya''.&lt;ref name=HIML/&gt; Some of these quotes are unique to ''Patanjala'', but others are also found in major Hindu medical treatises such as ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]''.&lt;ref name=HIML/&gt;

There is a fourth scholar also named Patanjali, who likely lived in 8th-century CE and wrote a commentary on ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and this text is called ''Carakavarttika''.&lt;ref name="meulenbeld143"/&gt; The two medical scholars named Patanjali may be the same person, but generally accepted to be completely different person than the Patanjali who wrote the Sanskrit grammar classic ''Mahabhasya''.&lt;ref name=meulenbeld143/&gt;

'''Peter Bieri''' (born 23 June 1944), better known by his pseudonym, '''Pascal Mercier''', is a Swiss writer and philosopher.

==Academic background==
Bieri studied philosophy, English studies and Indian studies in both London and Heidelberg. He took his doctoral degree in Heidelberg in 1971 after studies with [[Dieter Henrich]] and [[Ernst Tugendhat]] on the [[philosophy of time]], with reference to the work of [[J. M. E. McTaggart]]. After the conferral of his doctorate, Bieri followed an academic career at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Harvard University]], the [[Berlin Institute for Advanced Study|Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin]] and the [[Van Leer Institute|Van Leer Jerusalem Institute]]. In 1983 he started work at the [[Bielefeld University|University of Bielefeld]] and later he worked as a scientific assistant at the Philosophical Seminar at [[University of Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanser-literaturverlage.de/autoren/autor.html?id=20696 Bieri's CV]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bieri co-founded the research unit for Cognition and Brain studies at the [[German Research Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/Forschung/Gesamtliste-Veranstaltungen.pdf ZiF workshops] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060224074032/http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/Forschung/Gesamtliste-Veranstaltungen.pdf |date=2006-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focuses of his research were the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]]. From 1990 to 1993, he was a professor of the [[history of philosophy]] at the [[University of Marburg]]; from 1993 he taught philosophy at the [[Free University of Berlin]] while holding the chair of [[analytic philosophy]], succeeding his mentor, Ernst Tugendhat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/we01/mitarbeiter/bieri/index.html Free University, Philosophy Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622183151/http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/we01/mitarbeiter/bieri/index.html |date=2009-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he retired early, disillusioned by academic life and condemning what he saw as the rise of [[managerialism]] ("''Eine Diktatur der Geschäftigkeit")'' and decline in respect for academic work.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Papst, ''Peter Bieri alias Pascal Mercier hat genug von der Universität.'' In: ''[[NZZ am Sonntag]]'', 27 May 2007 (with quotation from ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 23 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pseudonym and work as a writer ==
As a writer, Bieri uses the pseudonym Pascal Mercier, made up of the surnames of the two French philosophers [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]]. Martin Halter, in ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', criticized Bieri's attempt "to dress up the trite man from Berne in a French philosopher's lace jabot"&lt;ref&gt;Martin Halter, ''Die Seele hängt voller Geigen.'' In: ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as a pretentious mannerism. Peter Bieri has published four novels to date. Reviewers have identified “heart, pain and a lot of fate” as “his recipe for success”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Halter, ''Die Seele hängt voller Geigen.'' In: ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.'' 30 May 2007: “Herz, Schmerz und viel Schicksal”, “sein Erfolgsrezept”. Similarly Joseph Hanimann, ''Mit dieser Geige findet sie den Tod.'' In: ''Süddeutsche Zeitung.'' 16 July 2007: “painting emotion in a way that borders on kitsch” (“an Kitsch grenzende Gefühlsbeschreibung”), and Volker Weidermann, ''Professor Kitsch.'' In: ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.'' 10 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which Bieri, aiming at “wellness literature”&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Falcke, ''Abgeschmackte Stimmungsmacherei.'' In: ''DIE ZEIT.'' 10 June 2007: “literarische Wellness”.&lt;/ref&gt;, applies in each of his books with little variation.

In law, a '''reasonable person''', '''reasonable man''', or [[the man on the Clapham omnibus]]&lt;ref name="Clapham omnibus"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2013_0108_Judgment.pdf |title=Healthcare at Home Limited v. The Common Services Agency, [2014] UKSC 49 |date=30 July 2014 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] |quote=It follows from the nature of the reasonable man, as a means of describing a standard applied by the court, that '''it would be misconceived for a party to seek to lead evidence from actual passengers [i.e. "the right-thinking member of society," "the [[officious bystander]]," "the reasonable parent," "the reasonable landlord," "the fair-minded and informed observer,"...] on the [[the man on the Clapham omnibus|Clapham omnibus]] as to how they would have acted in a given situation or what they would have foreseen, in order to establish how the reasonable man would have acted or what he would have foreseen.''' Even if the party offered to prove that his witnesses were reasonable men, the evidence would be beside the point. The behaviour of the reasonable man is not established by the evidence of witnesses, but by the application of a legal standard by the court. The court may require to be informed by evidence of circumstances which bear on its application of the standard of the reasonable man in any particular case; but it is then for the court to determine the outcome, in those circumstances, of applying that impersonal standard.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a hypothetical person of [[legal fiction]] crafted by the courts and communicated through [[case law]] and [[jury instructions]].&lt;ref name="anthropomorphic"/&gt; 

Strictly according to the fiction, it is misconceived for a party to seek evidence from actual people in order to establish how the reasonable man would have acted or what he would have foreseen.&lt;ref name="Clapham omnibus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BvD"/&gt; This person's character and care conduct under any ''common set of facts,'' is decided through reasoning of good practice or policy—or "learned" permitting there is a compelling consensus of public opinion—by high courts.&lt;ref name="275 U.S. 66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

In some practices, for circumstances arising from an ''uncommon set of facts,''&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt; this person is seen to represent a composite of a relevant community's judgement as to how a typical member of said community should behave in situations that might pose a threat of harm (through action or inaction) to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=R v Camplin |vol= |reporter=A.C. |opinion=705 |pinpoint= |court= |year=1978 |url= |quote=[a reasonable man] "means an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of self-control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cases resulting in [[judgment notwithstanding verdict]], such as [[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants]], can be examples where a vetted jury's composite judgment were deemed outside that of the actual fictional reasonable person, and thus overruled.

The reasonable person belongs to a family of hypothetical figures in law including: the "right-thinking member of society," the "[[officious bystander]]," the "reasonable parent," the "reasonable landlord," the "fair-minded and informed observer," the "[[person having ordinary skill in the art]]" in [[patent law]], and stretching back to Roman jurists, the figure of the [[bonus paterfamilias]],&lt;ref name="Clapham omnibus"/&gt; all used to define legal standards.  While there is a loose consensus in [[black letter law]], there is no accepted technical definition.  As with [[legal fiction]] in general, it is somewhat susceptible to [[ad hoc]] manipulation or transformation, and hence the "reasonable person" is an emergent concept of [[common law]].&lt;ref name="BvD"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bedder v Director of Public Prosecutions |vol=1 |reporter=WLR |opinion=1119 |pinpoint= |court= |year=1954 |url= |quote=[where reasonable man is deemed a wholly impersonal fiction to which no special characteristic of the accused should be attributed] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "reasonable person" is used as a tool to standardize, teach law students, or explain the law to a jury.&lt;ref name="anthropomorphic"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Regina v Smith |vol=4 |reporter=AER |opinion=289 |pinpoint= |court= |year=2000 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000727/smith-1.htm |quote=[sub-citing Camplin and Bedder:] the concept of the "reasonable man" has never been more than a way of explaining the law to a jury; an anthropomorphic image to convey to them, with a suitable degree of vividness, the legal principle that even under provocation, people must conform to an objective standard of behaviour that society is entitled to expect }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[legal fiction]],&lt;ref name="BvD"/&gt; the "reasonable person" is not an average person or a typical person, leading to great difficulties in applying the concept in some criminal cases, especially in regards to the partial defence of provocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.quentsons.com/provocation |title=The Concept of the Reasonable Man in the Partial Defence of Provocation |accessdate=11 May 2015 |year=2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518085503/http://www.quentsons.com/provocation |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard also holds that each person owes a duty to behave as a reasonable person would under the same or similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Brown v.

The standard performs a crucial role in determining [[negligence (law)|negligence]] in both [[criminal law]]—that is, [[criminal negligence]]—and [[tort]] law.

The standard is also used in [[contract]] law,&lt;ref&gt;For the use in transnational contract law: [http://www.trans-lex.org/902000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; to determine contractual intent, or if a breach of the [[standard of care]] has occurred, provided a [[duty of care]] can be proven. The intent of a party can be determined by examining the understanding of a reasonable person, after consideration is given to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/biblio/zeller8.html#iii|title=Bruno Zeller|first=|last=JLonghitano|date=|website=www.cisg.law.pace.edu|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard does not exist independently of other circumstances within a case that could affect an individual's judgment.

==History==
In 1835, [[Adolphe Quetelet]] detailed the characteristics of ''l'homme moyen'' ([[French language|French]], "average man"). His work is translated into English several ways. As a result, some authors pick "average man", "common man", "reasonable man", or stick to the original "''l'homme moyen''".  Quetelet was a [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]] [[astronomer]], [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[sociologist]]. He documented the physical characteristics of man on a statistical basis and discussed man's motivations when acting in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.ucla.edu/history/athenaeum.pdf|title=On Man, and the development of his faculties, The Athenæum, by A. Quetelet, Secretary to the Royal Academy of Brussels. London: Bossange &amp; Co pp. 593-594, August 8 1835|author=|date=|website=ucla.edu|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the "reasonable person" made his first appearance in the [[Law of England and Wales|English]] case of ''[[Vaughan v. Menlove]]'' (1837).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Vaughan v. Menlove |vol=132 |reporter=ER |opinion=490 |pinpoint= |court=Common Pleas |year=1837 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Menlove'', the [[defendant]] had stacked hay on his rental property in a manner prone to spontaneous ignition. After he had been repeatedly warned over the course of five weeks, the hay ignited and burned the defendant's barns and stable and then spread to the landlord's two cottages on the adjacent property. Menlove's [[Lawyer|attorney]] admitted his client's "misfortune of not possessing the highest order of intelligence," arguing that negligence should only be found if the jury decided Menlove had not acted with "''[[good faith|bona fide]]'' [and] to the best of his [own] judgment."

The ''Menlove'' court disagreed, reasoning that such a standard would be too subjective, instead preferring to set an [[objective standard]] for adjudicating cases:
{{quote|The care taken by a prudent man has always been the rule laid down; and as to the supposed difficulty of applying it, a jury has always been able to say, whether, taking that rule as their guide, there has been negligence on the occasion in question. Instead, therefore, of saying that the liability for negligence should be co-extensive with the judgment of each individual, which would be as variable as the length of the foot of each individual, we ought rather to adhere to the rule which requires in all cases a regard to caution such as a man of ordinary prudence would observe. That was, in substance, the criterion presented to the jury in this case and, therefore, the present rule must be discharged.}}

[[England|English]] courts upheld the standard again nearly 20 years later in ''[[Blyth v. Company Proprietors of the Birmingham Water Works]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Blyth v. Company Proprietors of the Birmingham Water Works |vol=156 |reporter=ER |opinion=1047 |pinpoint= |court=Exchequer |year=1856 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; holding:
{{quote|Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.}}

==Rationale==
[[United States|American]] [[jurist]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] explained the theory behind the reasonable person standard as stemming from the impossibility of "measuring a man's powers and limitations."&lt;ref name="Holmes-1909-108"&gt;Holmes, at 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual, personal quirks inadvertently injuring the persons or property of others are no less damaging than intentional acts. For society to function, "a certain average of conduct, a sacrifice of individual peculiarities going beyond a certain point, is necessary to the general welfare."&lt;ref name="Holmes-1909-108"/&gt; Thus, a reasonable application of the law is sought, compatible with planning, working, or getting along with others. As such, "his neighbors accordingly require him, at his proper peril, to come up to their standard, and the courts which they establish decline to take his personal equation into account."&lt;ref name="Holmes-1909-108"/&gt; He heralded the reasonable person as a [[legal fiction]] whose care conduct under any common set of facts, is chosen—or "learned" permitting there is a compelling consensus of public opinion—by the courts.&lt;ref name="275 U.S. 66"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/275/66/case.html |title=Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. Goodman, 275 U.S. 66 |author=[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] |journal=[[United States Reports]] |volume=275 |page=66 |date=October 31, 1927 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]] |quote=In an action for negligence, the question of due care is not left to the jury when resolved by a clear standard of conduct which should be laid down by the courts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]] |author=[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |date=1881 |pages=108, 122–123 |chapter=Lecture III—D. Liability for unintended Harm is determined by what would be Blameworthy in Average man |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/commonlaw00holmuoft#page/108/mode/2up |quote=[Page 108] The standards of the law are standards of general application. The law takes no account of the infinite varieties of temperament, intellect, and education which make the internal character of a given act so different in different men ... [Page 122] the averment that the defendant has been guilty of negligence ... that his alleged conduct does not come up to the legal standard. ... the question whether the court or the jury ought to judge of the defendant's conduct is wholly unaffected by the accident, ... it is entirely possible to give a series of hypothetical instructions adapted to every state of facts which it is open to the jury to find. ... the court may still take their opinion as to the standard. ... [page 123] ...supposing a state of facts often repeated in practice, is it to be imagined that the court is to go on leaving the standard to the jury forever? ... if the jury is, on the whole, as fair a tribunal as it is represented to be, the lesson which can be got from that source will be learned.... the court will find ... the conduct complained of usually is or is not blameworthy, ... or '''it will find the jury oscillating to and fro, and will see the necessity of making up its mind for itself.''' There is no reason why any other such question should not be settled, as well as that of liability for stairs with smooth strips of brass upon their edges...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasonable person standard is by no means democratic in its scope; it is, contrary to popular conception, intentionally distinct from that of the "average person," who is not necessarily guaranteed to always be reasonable.&lt;ref name="TJH"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=The T.J. Hooper |vol=60 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=737 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |year=1932 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasonable person will weigh all of the following factors before acting:
* the foreseeable risk of harm his actions create versus the utility of his actions;
* the extent of the risk so created;
* the likelihood such risk will actually cause harm to others;
* any alternatives of lesser risk, and the costs of those alternatives.
Taking such actions requires the reasonable person to be appropriately informed, capable, aware of the law, and fair-minded. Such a person might do something extraordinary in certain circumstances, but whatever that person does or thinks, it is always reasonable.

The reasonable person has been called an "excellent but odious character."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, at 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|He is an ideal, a standard, the embodiment of all those qualities which we demand of the good citizen ... [he] invariably looks where he is going, ... is careful to examine the immediate foreground before he executes a leap or bound; ... neither stargazes nor is lost in meditation when approaching trapdoors or the margins of a dock; ... never mounts a moving [bus] and does not alight from any car while the train is in motion, ... uses nothing except in moderation, and even flogs his child in meditating only on the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

English legal scholar [[Percy Henry Winfield]] summarized much of the literature by observing that:

{{quote|[H]e has not the courage of Achilles, the wisdom of Ulysses or the strength of Hercules, nor has he the prophetic vision of a clairvoyant. He will not anticipate folly in all its forms but he never puts out of consideration the teachings of experience and so will guard against negligence of others when experience shows such negligence to be common. He is a reasonable man but not a perfect citizen, nor a "paragon of circumspection. ..."&lt;ref&gt;Business Law of Australia (Vermeesch &amp; Lindgren) 4th Ed, 1983, p 1113&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Hand Rule==
{{Main|Calculus of negligence}}
Under [[United States|American]] common law, a well known—though nonbinding—test for determining how a reasonable person might weigh the criteria listed above was set down in ''[[United States v. Carroll Towing Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=United States v. Carroll Towing Co. |vol=159 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=169 |court=2d. Cir.|year=1947 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947 by the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, [[Learned Hand]]. The case concerned a [[barge]] that had broken her [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] with the dock. Writing for the court, Hand said:
{{quote|[T]he owner's duty, as in other similar situations, to provide against resulting injuries is a function of three variables: (1) The probability that she will break away; (2) the gravity of the resulting injury, if she does; (3) the burden of adequate precautions.}}

While the test offered by Hand does not encompass all the criteria available above, [[jury|juries]] in a [[negligence (law)|negligence]] case might well still be instructed to take the other factors into consideration in determining whether the [[defendant]] was negligent.&lt;ref&gt;Glannon, at pg. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal circumstances==
While the [[legal fiction]]&lt;ref name="BvD"/&gt; of the reasonable person represents the ideal human actor, one would be hard-pressed to characterize any individual human as meeting the standard, whether in whole or in part, all of the time. Since some human actors have limitations, the standard only requires that people act similarly to how "a reasonable person under the circumstance" would, as if their limitations were themselves circumstances. As such, courts require that the reasonable person be viewed as experiencing the same limitations as the defendant.

For example, a disabled defendant is held to a standard that, by necessity, represents how a reasonable person with that same disability would act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Hill v. Greenwood |vol=100 |reporter=N.W. |opinion=522 |pinpoint= |court=Iowa |year=1904 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One should not mistake this allowance for physical limitations as an allowance for poor judgment, attempting acts beyond one's abilities, or acting too quickly, etc. Were such allowances made for every defendant, there would be as many different standards for negligence as there were defendants; and courts would spend innumerable hours, and the parties much more money, on determining that particular defendant's reasonableness, character, and intelligence.

By using the reasonable person standard, the courts instead use an objective tool and avoid such subjective evaluations. The result is a standard that allows the law to behave in a uniform, foreseeable, and neutral manner when attempting to determine liability.

===Children===
One broad allowance made to the reasonable person standard is for children. The standard here requires that a child act in a similar manner to how a "reasonable person of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances" would act.&lt;ref&gt;Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts. §283A&lt;/ref&gt; In many common law systems, children under the age of 6 or 7 are typically exempt from any liability, whether civil or criminal, as they are deemed to be unable to understand the risk involved in their actions. This is called the [[defense of infancy]]: in Latin, ''doli incapax.''
In some jurisdictions, one of the exceptions to these allowances concern children engaged in what is primarily considered to be high-risk adult activity, such as operating a motor vehicle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Robinson v. Lindsay |vol=598 |reporter=P.2d |opinion=392 |pinpoint= |court=Wash. |year=1979 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Stevens v. Veenstra |vol=226 |reporter=Mich. App. |opinion=441 |pinpoint= |court= |year=1997 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in some jurisdictions, children can also be "[[trial as an adult|tried as an adult]]" for serious crimes, such as [[murder]], which causes the court to disregard the defendant's age.

===Mentally ill===
The reasonable person standard makes no allowance for the mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Breunig v. American Family Insurance Co. |vol=173 |reporter=N.W.2d |opinion=619 |pinpoint= |court=Wis. |year=1970 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a refusal goes back to the standard set in ''Menlove'', where Menlove's attorney argued for the [[subjective standard]]. In the 170 years since, the law has kept to the legal judgment of having only the single, objective standard. Such judicial adherence sends a message that the mentally ill would do better to refrain from taking risk-creating actions, unless they exercise a heightened degree of self-restraint and precaution, if they intend to avoid liability.

Generally, the courts have rationed that by not accepting mental illness as a bar to recovery, a liable third party, in the form of a caregiver, will be more likely to protect the public because of the potential for liability. The courts have also stated that the reasoning behind the harsh treatment is because, unlike children or the physically disabled, members of the public are unable to identify a person with a mental illness.

===Professionals===
In cases where a human actor utilizes a professional skill set, the "reasonable person under the circumstances" test becomes elevated to a standard of whether the person acted how a "reasonable professional under the circumstances" would have, without regard to whether that actor is actually a professional, and further without regard to the degree of training or experience of that particular actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Heath v. Swift Wings, Inc. |vol=252 |reporter=S.E.2d |opinion=526 |pinpoint= |court=N.C. |year=1979 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors also become relevant, such as the degree to which the professional is educated (i.e., whether a specialist within the specific field, or just a general practitioner of the trade), and customary practices and general procedures of similar professionals. However, such other relevant factors are never dispositive.

Some professions may maintain a custom or practice long after a better method has become available. The new practices, though less risky, may be entirely ignored. In such cases, the practitioner may very well have acted unreasonably despite following custom or general practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bolitho v. City and Hackney Health Authority [1997] 4 All ER 771&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical professionals====
In the realm of healthcare, plaintiffs must prove via expert testimony the standard of medical care owed and a departure from that standard. The only exception to the requirement of expert testimony is where the departure from accepted medical practices was so egregious that a layperson can readily recognize the departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Heimer v. Privratsky |vol=434 |reporter=N.W.2d |opinion=357 |pinpoint= |court=N.D. |year=1989 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, controversial medical practices can be deemed reasonable when followed by a respected and reputable minority of the medical field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Gala v. Hamilton |vol=715 |reporter=A.2d |opinion=1108 |pinpoint= |court=Pa. |year=1998 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or where the medical profession cannot agree over which practices are best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Furey v. Thomas Jefferson Uni. Hospital |vol=472 |reporter=A.2d |opinion=1083 |pinpoint= |court=Pa. |year=1984 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Armed professionals====
The "reasonable officer" standard is a method often applied to law enforcement and other armed professions to help determine if a use of force was correctly applied. The test is usually applied to whether the level of force used was excessive or not. If an appropriately trained professional, knowing what the subject of the investigation knew at the time and following their agency guidelines (such as a [[force continuum]]), would have used the same level of force or higher, then the standard is met. If the level of response is determined to be justified, the quantity of force used is usually presumed to have been necessary unless there are additional factors. For example, should it be determined that a trained police officer was justified in using deadly force against a suspect, the number of times he fired is presumed to have been necessary to stop the suspect's action that justified use of deadly force, as long as there aren't other factors, such as a reckless disregard of other officers' or bystanders' safety, or it is clearly proven that additional force was used after the suspect was no longer a threat.

===Inexperience===
When any person undertakes a skills-based activity that creates a risk to others, they are held to the minimum standard of how a reasonable person experienced in that task would act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Delair v. McAdoo |vol=188 |reporter=A. |opinion=181 |pinpoint= |court=Pa. |year=1936 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of their actual level of experience.&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Dellwo v. Pearson |vol=107 |reporter=N.W.2d |opinion=859 |pinpoint= |court=Minn. |year=1961 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External circumstances==
Factors external to the defendant are always relevant. Additionally, so is the context within which each action is made. It is within these circumstances that the determinations and actions of the defendant are to be judged. There are myriad factors that could provide inputs into how a person acts: individual perceptions, knowledge, the weather, etc. The standard of care required for each set of circumstances will vary, yet the level of care due is always what is reasonable for that set of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Stewart v. Potts |vol=654 |reporter=A.2d |opinion=535 |pinpoint= |court=Pa. |year=1995 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While community customs may be relied upon to indicate what kind of action is expected in light of given circumstances, such customary requirements are not themselves conclusive of what a reasonable person would do.&lt;ref name="TJH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Texas &amp; Pacific Railway v. Behymer |vol=189 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=468 |pinpoint=470 |court= |year=1903 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is precisely for this wide-ranging variety of possible facts that the reasonable person standard is so broad (and often confusing and difficult to apply). However, a few general areas of relevant circumstances rise above the others.

===Emergency doctrine===
Allowing for circumstances under which a person must act urgently is important to preventing [[hindsight bias]] from affecting the [[trier of fact]]. Given pressing circumstances, a reasonable person may not always act in a manner similar to how they would have acted in a more relaxed setting. As such, it is only fair that actions be judged in light of any exigent conditions that could have affected how the defendant acted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Rivera v. New York City Transit Authority |vol=77 |reporter=N.Y.2d |opinion=332 |pinpoint= |court= |year=1991 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts. §296&lt;/ref&gt;

===Available resources===
In certain circumstances, human actors are faced with the problem of making do only with what is available. Such circumstances are relevant to any determination of whether the defendant acted reasonably. Where necessary resources are scarce, certain actions may be reasonable that would be unreasonable if those same resources were available and either readily at hand or realistically obtainable given other circumstances.

===Negligence ''per se''===
{{Main|Negligence per se}}
Because a reasonable person is objectively presumed to know the law, noncompliance with a local safety statute may also constitute negligence. The related doctrine of [[negligence per se|negligence ''per se'']] addresses the circumstances under which the law of negligence can become an implied [[cause of action]] for breaching a statutory standard of care. Conversely, minimal compliance with a safety statute does not always absolve a defendant if the trier of fact determines that the reasonable person should have taken actions beyond and in excess of what the statute required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Clinkscales v. Carver |vol=22 |reporter=Cal.2d |opinion=72 |pinpoint= |court= |year=1934 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the trier of fact finds the statute's standard itself is reasonable and the defendant acted in accordance with what the statute contemplated, the duty of care can be deemed met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Josephson v. Meyers |vol=429 |reporter=A.2d |opinion=877 |pinpoint= |court=Conn. |year=1980 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Espinoza v. Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Railway |vol=649 |reporter=N.E.2d |opinion=1323 |pinpoint= |court=Ill. |year=1995 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts. §288C&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasonable bystander==
{{Main|Offer and acceptance}}
For common law contracts, disputes over contract formation are subjected to what is known as the ''objective test of assent'' in order to determine whether a contract exists. This standard is also known as the [[officious bystander]], ''reasonable bystander'', ''reasonable third party'', or ''reasonable person in the position of the party''.&lt;ref name="Blum53"&gt;Blum, at pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the subjective test employed in most [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The test stems from attempts to balance the competing interests of the judicial policies of assent and of reliability. The former holds that no person ought to be contractually obligated if they did not consent to such an agreement; the latter holds that if no person can rely on actions or words demonstrating consent, then the whole system of commercial exchange will ultimately collapse.&lt;ref name="Blum52"&gt;Blum, at pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 19th century, courts used a test of subjective evaluation;&lt;ref name="Blum52"/&gt; that is, the trier of fact determined each party's understanding.&lt;ref name="Blum54"&gt;Blum, at pg. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; If both parties were of the [[Meeting of the minds|same mind and understanding]] on matters, then assent was manifested and the contract was valid. Between the 19th and 20th centuries, the courts shifted toward the objectivist test, reasoning that subjective testimony was often unreliable and self-serving.&lt;ref name="Blum52"/&gt;

From those opposite principles, modern law has found its way to a rough middle ground, though it still shows a strong bias toward the objective test.&lt;ref name="Blum53"/&gt; Promises and agreements are reached through manifestations of consent, and parties are liable for actions that deliberately manifest such consent; however, evidence of either party's state of mind can be used to determine the context of the manifestation if said evidence is reliable and compatible with the manifestation in question, though such evidence is typically given very little weight.&lt;ref name="Blum54"/&gt;

Another circumstance where the reasonable bystander test is used occurs when one party has inadvertently misstated the terms of the contract, and the other party sues to enforce those terms: if it would have been clear to a reasonable bystander that a mistake had been made, then the contract is [[voidable]] by the party who made the error; otherwise, the contract is binding.

==Reasonable person standard for victims==

===Reasonable woman===

==== Sexual harassment ====
A variant of the reasonable person can be found in [[sexual harassment]] law as the ''reasonable woman'' standard. The variation recognizes a difference between men and women regarding the effect of unwanted interaction with a sexual tone. As women have historically been more vulnerable to [[rape]] and sex-related violence than have men, some courts believe that the proper perspective for evaluating a claim of sexual harassment is that of the reasonable woman. Notably, J. Scalia held that women did not have constitutional protection from discrimination under the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause, where by extension of logic, held the "reasonable woman" standard to be of moot value. However, such has not been the majority opinion of the court. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/03/scalia-women-discrimination-constitution_n_803813.html|title=Scalia: Women Don't Have Constitutional Protection Against Discrimination|first=Amanda|last=Terkel|date=3 January 2011|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Satire====
Though the use of the reasonable woman standard has gained traction in some areas of the law, the standard has not escaped the crosshairs of humorists. In 1924, legal humorist [[A. P. Herbert]] considered the concept of the reasonable man at length in the fictional case of "Fardell v. Potts." In Herbert's fictional account, the judge addressed the lack of a reasonable woman standard in the common law, and ultimately concluded that "a reasonable woman does not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Herbet |first=Alan Patrick, Sir |title=Misleading Cases in the Common Law |edition=4th |year=1989 |publisher=William S. Hein &amp; Co., Inc. |location=Buffalo |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-u9qWlotKr4C|isbn=978-0-8377-2242-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===L'homme moyen sensuel===
The concept of ''[[l'homme moyen sensuel]]'' does not speak of a reasonable person's ability, actions, or understandings.  Rather it refers to the response of a reasonable person when presented with some form of information either by image or sound, or upon reading a book or magazine. A well-known application of the concept is Judge John M. Woolsey's lifting of the ban on the book [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]] by [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/kane/30scensorship/woosley.htm,|title=US District Court S. NY, OPINION A. 110-59, by John M. Woolsey, December 6, 1933|author=|date=|website=virginia.edu|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That ruling contemplated the effect the book would have upon a reasonable person of reasonable sensibility.  Similarly, when the publisher of [[Howl and Other Poems]] was charged in California with publishing an obscene book, the concept of l'homme moyen sensuel influenced the court's finding of innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~kthomps4/363-s02/horn-howl.htm|title=California v. Ferlinghetti|author=|date=|website=gmu.edu|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was nearly two decades after Woolsey that the US Supreme Court set down the standard by which materials, when viewed by l'homme moyen sensuel, were judged either obscene or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawreview.wustl.edu/inprint/85/2/Gillers.pdf A tendency to deprave and corrupt, Washington Law Review Vol.85, No. 2, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723104853/http://lawreview.wustl.edu/inprint/85/2/Gillers.pdf |date=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, it has been l'homme moyen sensuel that has dictated what is and is not obscene or pornographic in books, movies, pictures, and now the Internet for at least the past 100 years.

Very often, for instance, in the case of [[noise ordinance]]s, the enforcement of the law is only for the purpose of protecting the right of a "reasonable person of normal sensitivity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.bozeman.net/bozeman/government/commission/PDF/ordiances/noise.pdf Bozeman, Montana Noise Ordinance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloominggrovepolice.com/Noise%20Law%20Page.htm|title=Blooming Grove, NY Noise Ordinance|author=|date=|website=bloominggrovepolice.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romulustown.com/ordinances/ORDINANCE%20REGULATING%20NOISE.pdf|title=Town of Romulus, NY Noise Ordinance|author=|date=|website=romulustown.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Adamson''' (19 January 1852 – 8 February 1902&lt;!--Older sources (http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adamson,_Robert_%28DNB12%29) give different, inaccurate data: "died 5 February 1902"--&gt; was a Scottish philosopher and Professor of Logic at Glasgow.&lt;ref name=uni&gt;{{cite web|author=Scotland |url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2385&amp;type=P |title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of Robert Adamson |website=Universitystory.gla.ac.uk |date=1902-02-08 |accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in [[Kingsbarns]] in Fife.&lt;ref name=uni/&gt; His father was a solicitor, and his mother was the daughter of Matthew Buist, [[Factor (Scotland)|factor]] to [[George Baillie-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Haddington|Lord Haddington]]. In 1855 Mrs. Adamson was left a [[widow]] with small means, and devoted herself entirely to the education of her six children. Of these, Robert was successful from the first. At the end of his school career he entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] at the age of fourteen, and four years later graduated with first-class honours in mental philosophy, with prizes in every department of the faculty of Arts. He completed his university successes by winning the Tyndall-Bruce scholarship, the Hamilton fellowship (1872), the Ferguson scholarship (1872) and the Shaw fellowship (1873).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After a short residence at [[Heidelberg]] (1871), where he began his study of [[German philosophy]], he returned to Edinburgh as assistant first to [[Henry Calderwood]] and later to [[A. Campbell Fraser]]; he joined the staff of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (9th edition) (1874) and studied widely in the Advocates' Library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}&lt;ref name=uni/&gt;

==Professorial appointments==
In 1876 he came to England as successor to [[W. S. Jevons]] in the chair of logic and philosophy, at [[Owens College]], Manchester. In 1883 he received the honorary degree of [[LL.D.]] In 1893 he went to the [[University of Aberdeen]], and finally in 1895 to the chair of logic at the [[University of Glasgow]], which he held till his death.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}&lt;ref name=uni/&gt;

Except during the first few years at Manchester, he delivered his lectures without manuscripts. In 1903, under the title ''The Development of Modern Philosophy and Other Essays'', his more important lectures were published with a short biographical introduction by [[W. R. Sorley]] of [[Cambridge University]] (see ''Mind'', xiii. 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;73 foil.). Most of the matter is taken verbatim from the note-book of one of his students. Under the same editorship there appeared, three years later, his ''Development of Greek Philosophy''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In addition to his professional work, he did much administrative work for [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]] and the University of Glasgow. In the organisation of Victoria University he took a foremost part, and, as chairman of the Board of Studies at Owens College, he presided over the general academical board of the Victoria University. At Glasgow he was soon elected one of the representatives on the court, and to him were due in large measure the extension of the academical session and the improved equipment of the university.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Throughout his lectures, Adamson pursued the critical and [[historical method]] without formulating a constructive theory of his own. He felt that any philosophical advance must be based on the [[Kantian]] methods. It was his habit to make straight for the ultimate issue, disregarding half-truths and declining compromise. He left a hypothesis to be worked out by others; this done, he would criticise with all the rigour of logic, and with a profound distrust of imagination, metaphor and the attitude known as the will-to-believe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Philosophical views==
As he grew older his metaphysical optimism waned. He felt that the increase of knowledge must come in the domains of [[physical science]]. But this empirical tendency as regards science never modified his metaphysical outlook. He has been called Kantian and [[Neo-Kantian]], [[Metaphysical realism|realist]] and [[idealist]] (by himself, for he held that appearance and reality are co-extensive and coincident).

At the same time, in his criticism of other views he was almost typical of [[Hegelian idealism]]. All processes of reasoning or judgment (i.e. all units of thought) are (i) analysable only by abstraction, and (2) are compound of deduction and induction, i.e. rational and empirical. An illustration of his empirical tendency is found in his attitude to the Absolute and the Self. The "Absolute" doctrines he regarded as a mere disguise of failure, a dishonest attempt to clothe ignorance in the pretentious garb of mystery. The Self as a primary, determining entity, he would not therefore admit. He represented an [[empiricism]] which, so far from refuting, was actually based on, idealism, and yet was alert to expose the fallacies of a particular idealist construction (see his essay in ''Ethical Democracy'', edited by [[Stanton Coit]]).

==Personal life==
His wife, Margaret Duncan, the daughter of a Manchester merchant, was a woman of kindred tastes, and their union was entirely happy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Published writings==
It is matter for regret to the student that Adamson's active labours in the lecture room precluded him from systematic production. His writings consisted of short articles, of which many appeared in the Encyclopaedia and in ''Mind'', a volume on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and another on [[Fichte]]. At the time of his death he was writing a ''History of Psychology'', and had promised a work on Kant and the Modern Naturalists. Both in his life and in his writings he was remarkable for impartiality. It was his peculiar virtue that he could quote his opponents without warping their meaning. From this point of view he would have been perhaps the first historian of philosophy of his time, had his professional labours been less exacting.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The '''static interpretation of time''' is a view of time which arose in the early years of the 20th century from [[Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]]'s extension of special relativity in which time and space were famously united in physicists' thinking as spacetime.

Essentially the universe is regarded as akin to a reel of film &amp;ndash; which is a wholly static physical object &amp;ndash; but which when played through a movie projector conjures a world of movement, color, light and change. In the static view our whole universe &amp;ndash; our past, present, and future are fixed parts of that reel of film, and the projector is our consciousness.  But the 'happenings' of our consciousness have no objective significance &amp;ndash; the objective universe does not happen, it simply exists in its entirety, albeit perceived from within as a world of changes.

The alternative, and commonly assumed view, is that the world unfolds in existence, that our present has some wider physical significance, because the universe evolves in step with it.

The static view is the simpler in that all that is held to exist is the physical ordering of the universe. All that there is at every time simply exists. The unfolding view requires an additional quality to the universe &amp;ndash; that besides the physical ordering there is some quality of coming into and out of existence.

One can argue that the onus is therefore upon those who propose it, that the world unfolds, and that this additional quality they hold to (absent from special relativity) is indeed a ''physical'' feature of the world. There is however as yet no proof, experiment, or measurement, to show that our conscious experience of an unfolding present has any objective physical significance, or that the universe is anything other than static.

The static view is however commonly rejected for psychological, not scientific reasons, because it leads to a fatalistic or "fixed" conclusion about human existence &amp;ndash; our 'past', 'present', and 'future' being what they are &amp;ndash; there is no contingency in the world and no possibility of 'altering' or creating the future through some act of will &amp;ndash; the future exists. It is simply that our consciousness has not yet reached it.

==Quotes==
*"The objective world simply is, it does not happen. Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the life line of my body, does a section of this world come to life as a fleeting image in space which continuously changes in time." — [[Hermann Weyl]], ''Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science'' (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1949)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3188">'''Sānanda samādhi''', also known as "supreme bliss", or "with ecstasy", is the third level of the four samādhi described in the [[Yoga Sutras]] 1:17 by [[Patanjali]]. Sānanda: ''sa-'' means “with”, ''ananda'' means joy, bliss.

==Historical descriptions==
In Sutra 1:17 Patanjali tells us that ''samprajnata samadhi'' comprises four stages: "Complete high consciousness (samprajnata samadhi) is that which is accompanied by [[vitarka]] (reasoning), [[vicara]] (reflection), ''sananda'' (ecstasy), and [[sasmita]] (a sense of 'I'-ness)." ''Sānanda'' is free from vitarka and vicara.

This is joyous ''samādhi'' and it gives intense joy. In ''sānanda'' the gross and the five elements are given up. There arises in the Yogi a peculiar perception in the form of intense joy. In this state the mind continues to function, but knowledge of any particular object slowly fades away and the yogi becomes aware of the inner consciousness only. He experiences supreme bliss. In ''sānanda samādhi'' the yogi experiences a state of rapture or ecstasy, and the only thought in the mind is the wordless awareness of the feeling of "I am in pleasure, I am happy."

==Modern descriptions==
According to Dr. Sarasvati Buhrman PhD, "[[Mahavatar Babaji|Babaji]] once explained that when people feel blissful sensations during [[sādhanā]], on a gross level the breath is equal in both nostrils, and on the subtle level [[prana|pranic]] flow in ''ida'' and ''pingala'' [[nadis]] is balanced. This is called the [[sushumna]] breath because the residual prana of the sushuma, the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], flows in sushumna nadi, causing [[sattva]] [[guna]] to dominate. "It creates a feeling of peace. That peace is ananda." In ''sananda samadhi'' the experience of that ananda, that sattvic flow, is untainted by any other [[vritti]]s, or thoughts, save the awareness of the pleasure of receiving that bliss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= http://www.cit-sakti.com/kundalini/experiences-of-meditation2.htm | title= Experiences of Meditation II | author= ''Sarasvati Buhrman, Ph.D'' | publisher= ''Cit-Sakti'' | ISBN = 1-57951-038-8 | date= January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John C. Lilly|John C Lilly]], ''sānanda'' is the highest state of consciousness that can be experienced while staying in the body.  In his book ''Center of the Cyclone'' he describes sānanda as, "blissful state, making the Christ, the green qutub, realization of [[Barakah|baraka]], the reception of [[divine grace]], cosmic love, cosmic energy, heightened bodily awareness, highest function of bodily and planetside consciousness, being in love, being in a positive LSD energy state. In the Oth emotional center in the chest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Center of the Cyclone | author = "John C. Lilly" | year= 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is an application of "[[Eclecticism in textual criticism|reasoned eclecticism]]" to a small portion of the [[Quran: 14]]:35–41.{{sfn|Small|2011|p=4}}{{Cite quran|14|35|e=41}} The book contains four parts: 1) chapters one and two covering the introduction and photographs and descriptions of the [[manuscript]]s used; 2) chapters three through eight describing the textual variants in the manuscripts; 3) chapters nine through eleven which includes comparisons of these variants with Islamic records of variants, and discussing possible causes of the variants, including unintentional mistakes in [[oral transmission]] or intentional changes; 4) a concluding, twelfth chapter.

Small concludes that a critical text of the Quran cannot currently be constructed.  He says, "...the available sources do not provide the necessary information for reconstructing the original text of the Qur’ān from the time of Muhammad.   Neither do they yet provide the necessary information for reconstructing the text from the time immediately after Muhammad's death until the [[Samarkand Kufic Quran|first official edition]] of the Qur’ān traditionally ordered by the [[Uthman|Caliph ‘Uthmān"]].{{sfn|Small|2011|p=178}} [[Fred Donner]] interprets Small's work as showing "that there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission. [...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established."{{sfn|Donner|2014|p=168}}  Donner also says though that Small's conclusions are tentative, because analogous work on larger passages of the Quran may give different results.{{sfn|Donner|2014|p=169}}

==Reception==
Fred Donner of the [[University of Chicago]] writes that the book is of "manifest excellence and importance", with "but minor blemishes".{{sfn|Donner|2014|p=168–169}}  One fault Donner sees is that Small does not engage with the work of [[Christoph Luxenberg]]. Efim Rezvan of the [[Saint Petersburg State University]] says that the work is "capital" and brings "new insights to the history of the development of a standardized text of the Qur’ān."{{sfn|Rezvan|2011|pp=66–67}}  Marcin Grodzki of the [[University of Warsaw]] writes that—despite some "minor flaws"—Small should be congratulated for his work, and that it should be given a "prominent place" in libraries involved with the history of early Islam and the study of the Quran.{{sfn|Grodzki|2013|pp=1—2}}  One flaw Grodzki sees is that the book does not consider the possibility of the use different alphabets in the initial written transmission of the Quran, such as the use of the Syriac alphabet in [[Garshuni]].{{sfn|Grodzki|2013|p=2}} 

Hurtado in his review endorses Small's conclusions. "In Small's bold statement, ‘the history of the transmission of the text of the Qur’ān is at least as much a testament to the destruction of Qur’ān material as it is to its preservation’, and ‘is also testimony to the fact that there never was one original text of the Qur’ān’ (p. 180). What we have in the Qur’ān as transmitted is ‘a text-form that was chosen from amidst a group of others, which was then edited and canonized at the expense of these others, and has been improved upon in order to make it conform to a desired ideal’ (p. 184)." ... "This is not so totally different from the textual histories of other scriptural texts. And perhaps that is the chief point which emerges from Small's analysis. It is richly documented, informed by other recent scholarship (both traditional Muslim and ‘Western’), eirenic and respectful in tone, and a solid and impressive case for the observations advanced."{{sfn|Hurtado|2015|p=115-6}}

[[File:Huxley Perennial Philosophy coverblurb1946 Low Res.jpg|thumb|Publisher's jacket blurb for the first United Kingdom edition]]

'''''The Perennial Philosophy''''' is a comparative study of mysticism by the British writer and novelist [[Aldous Huxley]]. Its title derives from the theological tradition of the ''[[philosophia perennis]]''.

==Social and political context==

''The Perennial Philosophy'' was first published in 1945 immediately after the [[Second World War]] (and the defeat of [[National Socialism]]) by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] in the United States (1946 by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in the United Kingdom). The jacket text of the British first edition explains:&lt;ref name="Cover"&gt;{{cite book | author=Huxley, Aldous | authorlink=Aldous Huxley | title=The Perennial Philosophy | edition=1st. | year=1946 | publisher=Chatto and Windus | location= London | page=Dust Jacket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''The Perennial Philosophy'' is an attempt to present this Highest Common Factor of all theologies by assembling passages from the writings of those saints and prophets who have approached a direct spiritual knowledge of the Divine...&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;}}

The book offers readers, who are assumed to be familiar with the Christian religion and the Bible, a fresh approach employing Eastern and Western [[mysticism]]:
{{quote|Mr. Huxley quotes from the Chinese [[Taoist]] philosophers, from followers of [[Buddha]] and [[Muhammad|Mohammed]], from the [[Brahmin]] scriptures and from Christian mystics ranging from [[John of the Cross|St John of the Cross]] to [[William Law]], giving preference to those whose writings, often illuminated by genius, are unfamiliar to the modern reader.&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;}}

The final paragraph of the jacket text states:

{{quote|In this profoundly important work, Mr. Huxley has made no attempt to 'found a new religion'; but in analyzing the Natural Theology of the Saints, as he has described it, he provides us with an absolute standard of faith by which we can judge both our moral depravity as individuals and the insane and often criminal behaviour of the national societies we have created.&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;}}

==Scope of the book==

In the words of poet and anthologist [[John Robert Colombo]]:

{{quote|''The Perennial Philosophy'' is essentially an anthology of short passages taken from traditional Eastern texts and the writings of Western mystics, organised by subject and topic, with short connecting commentaries. No specific sources are given. Paging through the index gives the reader (or non-reader) an idea of who and what Huxley has taken seriously. Here are the entries in the index that warrant two lines of page references or more:&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gurdjieffbooks.wordpress.com/category/the-perennial-philosophy-revisited/ | title=books, news, reviews | publisher=Gurdjieff Books Wordpress | work='THE PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY' revisited | date=16 June 2010 | accessdate=25 October 2011 | author=Colombo, John Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Aquinas, Augustine, St. Bernard, Bhagavad-Gita, Buddha, Jean Pierre Camus, St. Catherine, Christ, Chuang Tzu, "Cloud of Unknowing,” Contemplation, Deliverance, Desire, Eckhart (five lines, the most quoted person), Eternity, Fénelon, François de Sales, Godhead, Humility, Idolatry, St. John of the Cross, Knowledge, Lankavatara Sutra, William Law (another four lines), Logos, Love, Mahayana, Mind, Mortification, Nirvana, Perennial Philosophy (six lines, a total of 40 entries in all), Prayer, Rumi, Ruysbroeck, Self, Shankara, Soul, Spirit, "Theologia Germanica," Truth, Upanishads (six different ones are quoted), Will, Words.&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff/&gt;}}

==Style of the book==

Huxley deliberately chose less well-known quotations because "familiarity with traditionally hallowed writings tends to breed, not indeed contempt, but ... a kind of reverential insensibility, ... an inward deafness to the meaning of the sacred words."&lt;ref&gt;''The Perennial Philosophy'', page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, Chapter 5 on "Charity" takes just one quotation from the Bible, combining it with less familiar sources:

:"He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love."&lt;sub&gt;''1 John iv''&lt;/sub&gt;

:"By love may He be gotten and holden, but by thought never."&lt;sub&gt;''The Cloud of Unknowing''&lt;/sub&gt;

:"The astrolabe of the mysteries of God is love."&lt;sub&gt;''Jalal-uddin Rumi''&lt;/sub&gt;"&lt;ref name=PP95&gt;''The Perennial Philosophy'', page 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley then explains: "We can only love what we know, and we can never know completely what we do not love. Love is a mode of knowledge ..."&lt;ref name=PP95/&gt;

Huxley is quite vague with his references: "No specific sources are given."&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff /&gt;

==Structure of the book==

The book's structure consists of:

* A brief Introduction by Huxley, of just over 5 pages.
* Twenty-seven chapters (each of about 10 pages) of quotations from sages and saints on specific topics, with "short connecting commentaries."&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff /&gt; The chapters are not grouped in any way though there is a kind of order from the nature of the ''Ground'' at the beginning, down to practical exercises at the end. The Acknowledgements list 27 books from which quotations have been taken. The chapter titles are:

==Critical reception==

===In the United States===
''The Perennial Philosophy'' was widely reviewed when first published in 1945, with articles appearing in ''Book Week'', ''[[Booklist]]'', ''[[The Christian Century]]'', Bull VA Kirkus' Bookshop Serv., ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Saturday Review of Literature]]'', ''[[Springfield Republican]]'', ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', and the ''[[Wilson Bulletin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary reviews include:
*''Book Week'' (21 October 1945).
*''Booklist'' v. 42 (15 November 1945).
*''The Christian Century'' v. 62 (12 December 1945).
*Bull VA Kirkus' Bookshop Serv v. 13 (1 August 1945). 
*''The Nation'' v. 161 (27 October 1945).
*''The New Republic'' v. 113 (5 November 1945).
*''The New Yorker'' v. 21 (29 September 1945). 
*''Saturday Review of Literature'' v. 28 (3 November 1945).

*''Wilson Bulletin'' (White Plains, N.Y.) v. 41 (Dec. 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that, "Perhaps Mr. Huxley, in ''The Perennial Philosophy'' has, at this time, written the most needed book in the world."&lt;ref name=nyt1945&gt;{{cite news | author=Toksvig, Signe |title= Aldous Huxley's prescriptions for spiritual myopia| newspaper=New York Times |date= 30 September 1945 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' described the book as an:

{{quote|... anthology [that] is above all a masterpiece of discrimination.... [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] gave the name of the [[Perennial philosophy|Perennial Philosophy]] to this theme. Mr. Huxley has systematised, and dealt with, its many-branching problems, perils and [[beatitudes]].&lt;ref name=nyt1945/&gt;}}

The ''Times'' also stated that, "It is important to say that even an agnostic, even a behaviorist-materialist ... can read this book with joy. It is the masterpiece of all anthologies."&lt;ref name=nyt1945/&gt;

Similarly, forty years later [[Huston Smith]], a religious scholar, wrote that, in ''The Perennial Philosophy'':

{{quote|Huxley provides us with the most systematic statement of his mature outlook. Its running commentary deals with many of the social implications of Huxley's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous (1993) ''Huxley on God'', Introduction – Walter Houston Smith p. 9, HarperSanFrancisco {{ISBN|0-06-250536-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Not all the reception was so positive. Chad Walsh, writing in the ''Journal of Bible and Religion''&lt;ref name=ChadWalsh&gt;{{Cite journal| jstor=3693645 | title=Journal of Bible and Religion | publisher=Journal of Bible and Religion. Vol 16, No 1. pp 3–12 | work=Pilgrimage to the Perennial Philosophy: The Case of Aldous Huxley | date=January 1948 | author=Walsh, Chad | pages=3–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948, spoke of Huxley's distinguished family background, only to continue:

{{quote|The only startling fact, and the one that could not have been predicted by the most discerning sociologist or psychologist, is that in his mid-forties he was destined to turn also to mysticism, and that since his conversion he was to be one of a small group in California busily writing books to win as many people as possible over to the "perennial philosophy" as a way of life.&lt;ref name=ChadWalsh /&gt;}}

===In the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, reviewers admired the comprehensiveness of Huxley's survey but questioned his other-worldliness and were hostile to his belief in the paranormal.

[[C. E. M. Joad]] wrote in ''[[New Statesman and Society]]'' that, although the book was a mine of learning and Huxley's commentary was profound, readers would be surprised to find that he had adopted a series of peculiar beliefs such as the curative power of relics and spiritual presences incarnated in sacramental objects. Joad pointed out that, if the argument of the book is correct, only those who have undergone the religious experiences upon which it is based are properly able to assess its worth. Further, he found that the book was dogmatic and intolerant, "in which pretty well everything we want to do is wrong."

Finally, Joad asserted that Huxley's mistake was in his "intellectual whole-hoggery" and that he was led by ideas untempered by ordinary human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Joad, C.E.M. (5 October 1946) ''Huxley Gone Sou''r, The New Statesman and Society, 32, P. 249-50 in Watt, Donald ed. (1997) Aldous Huxley The Critical Heritage, pps 363–365, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-15915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the journal ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', the Anglican priest Rev. [[William Inge (priest)|W. R. Inge]] remarked on the book's well chosen quotations and called it "probably the most important treatise we have had on mysticism for many years." He saw it as evidence that Huxley was now a mystical philosopher, which he regarded as an encouraging sign. Inge pointed out conflicts between religions and within religion and agreed that a [[rapprochement]] must be through mystical religion. However, he wondered if the book, with its transcendence of the personality and detachment from worldly concerns, might not be more Buddhist than Christian. He concluded his review by calling into question Huxley's belief in [[Psychic|psychical phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;Inge, W.R. (April 1947) Perennial Philosophy – Review, Philosophy, XXII, pps 66–70 in Watt, Donald ed. (1997) Aldous Huxley The Critical Heritage, pps 366–368, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-15915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elsewhere===

Canadian author [[John Robert Colombo]] wrote that as a young man he, like many others in the 1950s, was swept away with enthusiasm for "the coveted volume" :

{{quote|Everyone interested in consciousness studies has heard of his study called ''The Perennial Philosophy''. It bears such a prescient and memorable title. His use of the title has preempted its use by any other author, neuropsychologist, Traditionalist, or enthusiast for the [[New Age]]. The book so nobly named did much to romanticise the notion of “perennialism” and to cast into the shade such long-established timid Christian notions of “[[ecumenicism]]” ([[Protestants]] dialoguing with [[Catholics]], etc.) or “inter-faith” meetings (Christians encountering non-Christians, etc.). Who would care about the beliefs of [[Baptists]] when one could care about the practices of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetans]]?''&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff/&gt;}}

Colombo also stated that:

{{quote|Painfully absent from these pages are Huxley's mordant wit and insights into human nature. It is as if his [[wiktionary:quicksilver|quicksilverish]] intelligence has been put on hold or has found itself in a deep freeze of his own making. When it comes to selecting short and sometimes long quotations, he is no compiler like [[John Bartlett (publisher)|John Bartlett]] of quotation fame, but he does find time to make a few deft personal observations.&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff/&gt;}}

==Huxley's view of perennial philosophy==
{{further|Perennial philosophy}}

Huxley's Introduction to ''The Perennial Philosophy'' begins:

{{quote|The [[metaphysic]] that recognises a divine Reality substantial to the world of things and lives and minds; the [[psychology]] that finds in the soul something similar to, or even identical with, divine Reality; the [[ethic]] that places man's final end in the knowledge of the [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Ground of being|Ground of all being]] — the thing is immemorial and universal.

Rudiments of the [[Perennial Philosophy]] may be found among the traditionary lore of primitive peoples in every region of the world, and in its fully developed forms it has a place in every one of the higher religions. A version of this [[Highest common factor|Highest Common Factor]] in all preceding and subsequent theologies was first committed to writing more than twenty-five centuries ago, and since that time the inexhaustible theme has been treated again and again, from the standpoint of every religious tradition and in all the principal languages of Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name=PP1&gt;(''The Perennial Philosophy'', Introduction, page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the next paragraph, Huxley summarises the problem more succinctly, saying: "Knowledge is a function of being."&lt;ref name=PP1 /&gt; In other words, if you are not suited to knowing something, you do not know it. This makes knowing the Ground of All Being difficult, in Huxley's view. Therefore, he concludes his Introduction with:

{{quote|If one is not oneself a sage or saint, the best thing one can do, in the field of metaphysics, is to study the works of those who were, and who, because they had modified their merely human mode of being, were capable of a more than merely human kind and amount of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;(''The Perennial Philosophy'', Introduction, pages 5–6.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''triad''' is one of many branches of Chinese [[transnationality|transnational]] [[organized crime|organized crime syndicates]] based in [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]] and in countries with significant [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese populations]], such as the [[Chinese Americans|United States]], [[Chinese Canadians|Canada]], [[Viet Hoa|Vietnam]], [[Chinese in Korea|Korea]], [[Chinese people in Japan|Japan]], [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]], [[Filipino Chinese|the Philippines]], [[Chinese Indonesian|Indonesia]], [[Malaysian Chinese|Malaysia]], [[Chinese Thai|Thailand]], the [[British Chinese|United Kingdom]], [[Chinese in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Chinese in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Chinese diaspora in France|France]], [[Chinese in Spain|Spain]], [[Chinese South African|South Africa]], [[Chinese Australian|Australia]], [[Brazil]] and [[New Zealand Chinese|New Zealand]].

The Hong Kong triad is distinct from mainland Chinese criminal organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Peng. "The Increasing Threat of Chinese Organised Crime: National, Regional and International Perspectives." ''The RUSI Journal'' 158.4 (2013): 6–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient China, the triad was one of three major secret societies.&lt;ref name="The Chinese Mafia"&gt;Wang, Peng (2017). ''The Chinese Mafia: Organized Crime, Corruption, and Extra-Legal Protection''.

(2002). ''The triads as business''. Routledge. {{ISBN|9780415757249}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, all secret societies were destroyed in mainland China in a series of campaigns organized by [[Mao Zedong]]. Although organized-crime groups have returned to China after Mao, they are not triad societies. Known as "mainland Chinese criminal organizations", they are of two major types: dark forces (loosely-organized groups) and black societies (more-mature criminal organizations). Two features which distinguish a black society from a dark force are the ability to achieve illegal control over local markets, and receiving police protection.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, P. (2013). The rise of the Red Mafia in China: a case study of organized crime and corruption in Chongqing. Trends in Organized crime, 16(1), 49–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hong Kong triad refers to traditional criminal organizations operating in (or originating from) Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and south-east Asian countries and regions, while organized-crime groups in mainland China are known as "mainland Chinese criminal groups".

Y. K. Chu's ''The Triads as Business'' (2002)&lt;ref name="as business"/&gt; examines the rise of the Hong Kong triad and the role of triad societies in legal, illegal and international markets. Peng Wang's ''The Chinese Mafia'' (2017)&lt;ref name="The Chinese Mafia"/&gt; studies the origin of Chinese secret societies in ancient China, explores the rise of organized crime in post-Mao China, and investigates the ways in which local gangs offer quasi-law enforcement and private protection to local governments, corporations and individuals. Wang's book also explores how local gangs form mutually-beneficial networks with police officers and how the formation of a political-criminal nexus enables local gangs to control illegal markets and sell protection to citizens and businesses.

==Etymology==
{{Chinese|title=Sanhehui|t=三合會|s=三合会|p=Sān Hé Huì|j=Saam&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Hap&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Wui&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|poj=Saⁿ-ha̍p-hōe|lmz=Se-gheh-we|l=Three Harmonies Society}}
According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', "triad" is a translation of the Chinese term ''San Ho Hui'' (or Triple Union Society), referring to the union of heaven, earth and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/triad |title=British &amp; World English: Definition of ''triad'' in English |website=Oxford Living Dictionaries |access-date=2 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115112216/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/triad |archivedate=15 January 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory posits that the word "triad" was coined by British authorities in [[British Hong Kong|colonial Hong Kong]] as a reference to the triads' use of triangular imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Gertz, in the ''Washington Times'': "British authorities in colonial Hong Kong dubbed the groups triads because of the triangular imagery."&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that triad organizations took after, or were originally part of, revolutionary movements such as the [[White Lotus Rebellion|White Lotus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Triad Societies'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping]] and [[Boxer Rebellion]]s and the [[Heaven and Earth Society]].

The generic use of the word "triads" for all Chinese criminal organizations is imprecise; triad groups are geographically, ethnically, culturally and structurally unique. "Triads" are traditional organized-crime groups originating from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="as business"/&gt; Criminal organizations operating in, or originating from, mainland China are "mainland Chinese criminal groups" or "black societies".&lt;ref name="The Chinese Mafia"/&gt; After years of repression, only some elements of triad groups are involved with illegal activities. Triads in Hong Kong are less involved with "traditional" criminal activity and are becoming associated with [[white-collar crime]]; traditional initiation ceremonies rarely take place to avoid official attention.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|author=De Leon Petta Gomes da Costa|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbcsoc/v32n93/0102-6909-rbcsoc-3293092017.pdf|title="As Tríades e as Sociedades Secretas na China: Entre o mito e a desmistificação"|journal=Brazilian Journal of Social Sciences|issn=1806-9053|date=20 February 2017|volume=32|issue=93|doi=10.17666/329309/2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312050204/http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbcsoc/v32n93/0102-6909-rbcsoc-3293092017.pdf|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
Triad, a China-based criminal organization, secret association or club, was a branch of the secret [[Hung Society]]. The society was fragmented, and one group (known as the Triad and the Ching Gang) became a criminal organization. After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, secret societies in mainland China were suppressed in campaigns ordered by [[Mao Zedong]]. Most Chinese secret societies, including the triads and some of the remaining Ching Gang, relocated to British-controlled Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia and overseas countries (particularly the US) and competed with the [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] and other Chinese secret societies. Gradually, Chinese secret societies turned to drugs and extortion for income.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Gangland- Deadly Triangle." Online video clip, YouTube. YouTube, 2008. Web. 21 Apr. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The Heaven and Earth Society (天地會, [[Tiandihui]]), a [[fraternal organization]], was founded during the 1760s. As the society's influence spread throughout China, it branched into several smaller groups with different names; one was the Three Harmonies Society (三合會, Sanhehui). These societies adopted the triangle as their emblem, usually accompanied by decorative images of swords or portraits of [[Guan Yu]].

===19th century===
[[British Hong Kong]] was intolerant of secret societies, and the British considered the triads a criminal threat. Triads were charged and imprisoned under British law.

During the 19th century, many such societies were seen as legitimate ways of helping immigrants from China settle into a new country. Secret societies were banned by the British government in Singapore during the 1890s, and slowly reduced in number by successive colonial governors and leaders. Facilitating the origins of Singapore gangs, the opium trade, prostitution and brothels were also banned. Immigrants were encouraged to seek help from a local ''[[kongsi]]'' instead of turning to secret societies, which contributed to the societies' decline.

===20th century===
After [[World War II]], the secret societies saw a resurgence as gangsters took advantage of uncertainty and growing anti-British sentiment. Some Chinese communities, such as "[[new village]]s" in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Bukit Ho Swee]] in Singapore, became notorious for gang violence. When the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] came to power in 1949 in mainland China, law enforcement became stricter and a government crackdown on criminal organizations forced the triads to migrate to British Hong Kong. An estimated 300,000 triad members lived in Hong Kong during the 1950s. According to the University of Hong Kong, most triad societies were established between 1914 and 1939 and there were once more than 300 in the territory. The number of groups has consolidated to about 50, of which 14 are under police surveillance. There were nine main triads operating in Hong Kong. They divided land by ethnic group and geographic locations, with each triad in charge of a region. The triads were [[Wo Hop To]], [[Wo Shing Wo]], Rung, Tung, Chuen, Shing, [[Sun Yee On]], [[14K Triad|14K]] and [[Luen Group|Luen]]. Each had a headquarters, sub-societies and public image. After the [[Hong Kong 1956 riots|1956 riots]], the Hong Kong government introduced stricter law enforcement and the triads became less active.

==={{anchor|Modern History}}21st century===
During the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], two triad gangs (reportedly [[Sun Yee On]] and [[Wo Shing Wo]]) were used to help restore order.{{Citation needed|reason=no citation|date=September 2018}} On 18 January 2018, Italian police arrested 33 people connected to a Chinese triad operating in Europe as part of its Operation China Truck (which began in 2011). The triad were active in [[Tuscany]], [[Veneto]], [[Rome]] and [[Milan]] in Italy, and in France, Spain and the German city of [[Neuss]]. The indictment accuses the Chinese triad of extortion, usury, illegal gambling, prostitution and drug trafficking. The group was said to have infiltrated the transport sector, using intimidation and violence against Chinese companies wishing to transport goods by road into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian police bust Chinese 'mafia' running rackets across Europe|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20180118/italy-chinese-mafia-china-truck|website=The Local IT|accessdate=23 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124005759/https://www.thelocal.it/20180118/italy-chinese-mafia-china-truck|archivedate=24 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police seized several vehicles, businesses, properties and bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Italy arrests 33 'Chinese mafia' members|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42724613|accessdate=23 January 2018|agency=BBC|date=18 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123092922/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42724613|archivedate=23 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal activities==
Triads engage in a variety of crimes, from [[fraud]], [[extortion]] and [[money laundering]] to [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] and [[prostitution]], and are involved in [[smuggling]] and [[Counterfeit consumer goods|counterfeiting goods]] such as music, video, software, clothes, watches and money.&lt;ref&gt;Gertz, for the ''Washington Times''. "Like other organized crime groups, triads [...] are engaged in a range of illegal activities such as bank and [[credit card fraud]], currency counterfeiting, money laundering, extortion, human trafficking and prostitution." Triads rarely fight other ethnic mob groups, fighting mainly among themselves or against other triads. However triads were involved in some territorial disputes with the Irish mob, Jewish mafia and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug trafficking===
Since the first [[opium]] bans during the 19th century, Chinese criminal gangs have been involved in worldwide [[illegal drug trade]]. Many triads switched from opium to heroin, produced from opium plants in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], refined into heroin in China and trafficked to North America and Europe, in the 1960s and 1970s. The most important triads active in the international heroin trade are the [[14K Triad|14K]] and the [[Big Circle Gang|Tai Huen Chai]]. Triads have begun smuggling chemicals from Chinese factories to North America (for the production of [[methamphetamine]]), and to Europe for the production of [[MDMA|Ecstasy]].

===Counterfeiting===
Triads have been engaging in counterfeiting since the 1880s. During the 1960s and 1970s, they were involved in [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting currency]] (often the Hong Kong 50-cent piece). The gangs were also involved in counterfeiting expensive books for sale on the black market. With the advent of new technology and the improvement of the average standard of living, triads produce counterfeit goods such as watches, film VCDs and DVDs and designer apparel such as clothing and handbags.&lt;ref&gt;M. Booth, ''The Dragon Syndicates; The Global Phenomenon of the Triads'', Doubleday-Great Britain 1999, pp 386–400.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, triad turf control was weakened and some shifted their revenue streams to legitimate businesses.&lt;ref name=hks20110121natalie&gt;Wong, Natalie (21 January 2011) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=36&amp;art_id=107259&amp;sid=30994212&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20110121&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2011 "Dragons smell blood again"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010212311/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=36&amp;art_id=107259&amp;sid=30994212&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20110121&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2011 |date=2014-10-10 }}. ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care fraud===
In 2012, four triad members were arrested for [[health care fraud]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&amp;to=en&amp;a=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/world/2012-11/14/c_123953295.htm|title=big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/world/2012-11/14/c_123953295.htm - Translator|author=|date=|website=www.microsofttranslator.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630160301/http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&amp;to=en&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fbig5.xinhuanet.com%2Fgate%2Fbig5%2Fnews.xinhuanet.com%2Fworld%2F2012-11%2F14%2Fc_123953295.htm|archivedate=30 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and composition==
[[File:Triad structure.svg|center|alt=Balloon chart|Traditional triad organizational structure]]
{{clear}}
Triads use numeric codes to distinguish ranks and positions within the gang; the numbers are inspired by Chinese numerology and based on the ''[[I Ching]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Mallory, ''Understanding Organized Crime'' (Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2007), page 137''&lt;/ref&gt; The Mountain (or [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] Master or Dragon [[Crime boss|Head]]) is 489, 438 is the Deputy Mountain Master, 432 indicates Grass Slipper rank;&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrhQ8mhvT4|title=ORGANIZED CRIME EPISODE 10   Triads|first=|last=Imran Kayani|date=15 November 2011|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512014607/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrhQ8mhvT4|archivedate=12 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Mountain Master's [[Underboss|proxy]], Incense Master (who oversees [[Made man|inductions]] into the triad), and Vanguard (who assists the Incense Master). A [[Caporegime|military commander]] (also known as a Red Pole), overseeing defensive and offensive operations, is 426; 49 denotes a [[Soldato|soldier]], or rank-and-file member. The White Paper Fan (415) [[Consigliere|provides financial and business advice]], and the Straw Sandal (432) is a liaison between units.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Mallory, ''Understanding Organized Crime'' (Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2007), pages 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Societies'', page 167&lt;/ref&gt; An undercover law-enforcement agent or spy from another triad is 25, also popular Hong Kong slang for an [[informant]]. Blue Lanterns are uninitiated members, equivalent to Mafia associates, and do not have a designating number. According to De Leon Petta Gomes da Costa, who interviewed triads and authorities in Hong Kong, most of the current structure is a vague, low hierarchy; the traditional ranks and positions no longer exist.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Initiation|36 Oaths}}Rituals and codes of conduct==
Similar to the [[Sicilian Mafia]] or the Japanese ''[[yakuza]]'', triad members participate in [[initiation]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Gertz, for the ''Washington Times''. "Like other organized crime groups, triads have elaborate initiation ceremonies similar to those of the Italian mafia [...]"&lt;/ref&gt; A typical ceremony takes place at an altar dedicated to [[Guan Yu]], with incense and an [[animal sacrifice]] (usually a chicken, pig or goat). After drinking a mixture of wine and blood (from the animal or the candidate), the member passes beneath an arch of swords while reciting the triad's oaths. The paper on which the oaths are written will be burnt on the altar to confirm the member's obligation to perform his duties to the gods. Three fingers of the left hand are raised as a binding gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_378.html |title=Feature Articles 378 |publisher=AmericanMafia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015170735/http://americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_378.html |archivedate=2010-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The triad initiate is required to adhere to 36 oaths.&lt;ref name=GB&gt;{{cite book|work=[[Google Books]]|title=Triad Societies, Volume 5|date=1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=36+oaths+triad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PiX8keM6SV&amp;sig=653NRAjEIYup2NW0cOkvweHhX8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-oI4U9D4NcadqAHsi4G4CA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=36%20oaths%20triad&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427233200/https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=36+oaths+triad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PiX8keM6SV&amp;sig=653NRAjEIYup2NW0cOkvweHhX8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-oI4U9D4NcadqAHsi4G4CA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=36%20oaths%20triad&amp;f=false|archivedate=2018-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tongs===
{{See also|Tong (organization)}}
Similar to triads, Tongs originated independently in early immigrant [[Chinatown]] communities. The word means "social club," and tongs are not specifically underground organizations. The first tongs formed during the second half of the 19th century among marginalized members of early immigrant Chinese-American communities for mutual support and protection from [[Nativism (politics)|nativists]]. Modeled on triads, they were established without clear political motives and became involved in criminal activities such as extortion, illegal gambling, drug and human trafficking, murder and prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mafianj.com/asian/tongs.shtml|title=The Mafia in New Jersey - Asian Organized Crime Groups - Tongs and Street Gangs - Asian Organized Crime Groups|author=|date=|website=www.mafianj.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110716005719/http://www.mafianj.com/asian/tongs.shtml|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sekeres III, [http://www.gangresearch.net/ChicagoGangs/tongs/sek1.html Institutionalization of the Chinese Tongs in Chicago's Chinatown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040841/http://www.gangresearch.net/ChicagoGangs/tongs/sek1.html |date=2011-09-28 }} (accessed June 26, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asia===
{{See also|Secret societies in Singapore}}
Triads were also active in Chinese communities throughout Southeast Asia. When Malaysia and Singapore (with the region's largest population of ethnic Chinese) became [[Crown colony|crown colonies]], secret societies and triads controlled local communities by extorting [[protection racket|protection money]] and [[Loan shark|illegal money lending]]. Many conducted blood rituals, such as drinking one another's blood, as a sign of brotherhood; others ran opium dens and brothels.

Remnants of these former gangs and societies still exist. Due to government efforts in Malaysia and Singapore to reduce crime, the societies have largely faded from the public eye (particularly in Singapore).

Triads were also common in Vietnamese cities with large Chinese (especially [[Cantonese]] and [[Teochew people|Teochew]]) communities. During the [[French Indochina|French colonial period]], many businesses and wealthy residents in [[Saigon]] (particularly in the [[Cholon, Ho Chi Minh City|Chinatown district]]) and [[Haiphong]] were controlled by protection-racket gangs.

With Vietnamese independence in 1945, organized crime activity was drastically reduced as [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s governments purged criminal activity in the country. According to Ho, abolishing crime was a method of protecting Vietnam and its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antv.gov.vn/tin-tuc/chinh-tri/luc-luong-cand-trong-khang-chien-chong-phap-151940.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022033504/http://www.antv.gov.vn/tin-tuc/chinh-tri/luc-luong-cand-trong-khang-chien-chong-phap-151940.html |archivedate=2017-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Indochina War]], Ho's police forces concentrated on protecting people in his zone from crime; the French cooperated with criminal organisations to fight the [[Viet Minh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catp.danang.gov.vn/lich-su-cong-an-nhan-dan|title=Lịch sử Công an nhân dân - Công An Đà Nẵng|author=|date=|website=www.catp.danang.gov.vn|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022033712/http://www.catp.danang.gov.vn/lich-su-cong-an-nhan-dan|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, President [[Ngô Đình Diệm]] ordered the [[South Vietnam]]ese military to disarm and imprison organized-crime groups in the Saigon-[[Gia Định Province|Gia Định]]-[[Biên Hòa]]-[[Vũng Tàu]] region and cities such as [[Mỹ Tho]] and [[Cần Thơ]] in the [[Mekong Delta]]. Diem banned brothels, massage parlours, casinos and gambling houses, opium dens, bars, drug houses and nightclubs, all establishments frequented by the triads. However, Diệm allowed criminal activity to finance his attempts to eliminate the Viet Minh in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thuvienhoasen.org/a16610/18-che-do-ngo-dinh-diem-va-van-de-buon-ban-nha-phien-pham-trong-luat |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032506/https://thuvienhoasen.org/a16610/18-che-do-ngo-dinh-diem-va-van-de-buon-ban-nha-phien-pham-trong-luat |archivedate=2017-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement was stricter in the [[North Vietnam|north]], with stringent control and monitoring of criminal activities. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam purged and imprisoned organized criminals, including triads, in the [[Haiphong]] and [[Hanoi]] areas. With pressure from Ho Chi Minh's police, Triad affiliates had to choose between elimination or legality. During the [[Vietnam War]], the triads were eliminated in the north; in the south, Republic of Vietnam corruption protected their illegal activities and allowed them to control US aid. During the 1970s and 1980s, all illegal Sino-Vietnamese activities were eliminated by the Vietnamese police. Most triads were compelled to flee to Taiwan, Hong Kong or other countries in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24h.com.vn/tin-tuc-quoc-te/hoi-tam-hoang-mot-thoi-vung-vay-tren-dat-viet-c415a807260.html|title=Hội Tam Hoàng: Một thời vùng vẫy trên đất Việt|first=Tin Tức|last=24h|date=|website=24h.com.vn|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427233202/https://www.24h.com.vn/tin-tuc-quoc-te/hoi-tam-hoang-mot-thoi-vung-vay-tren-dat-viet-c415a807260.html|archivedate=27 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International activities===
Triads are also active in other regions with significant overseas-Chinese populations: Macau, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Brazil, Peru and Argentina. They are often involved in migrant smuggling. Shanty and Mishra (2007) estimate that the annual profit from narcotics is $200 billion, and annual revenues from human trafficking into Europe and the United States are believed to amount to $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;Shanty, Frank; Mishra, Patit Paban [https://books.google.com/books?id=-L8B8ydtHZ4C&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=%22sun+yee+on%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JX6zTtv6LMjvmAWx4qHKAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sun%20yee%20on%22&amp;f=false ''Organized crime: from trafficking to terrorism''], pg 138, Volume 2. {{ISBN|1576073378}} ABC-CLIO (September 24, 2007)

====Hong Kong====
The [[Hong Kong Police Force#Crime Wing|Organized Crime and Triad Bureau]] (OCTB) is the division of the Hong Kong Police Force responsible for triad countermeasures. The OCTB and the Criminal Intelligence Bureau work with the Narcotics and Commercial Crime Bureaus to process information to counter triad leaders. Other involved departments include the [[Customs and Excise Department (Hong Kong)|Customs and Excise Department]], the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] and the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]]. They cooperate with the police to impede the expansion of triads and other organized gangs.&lt;ref&gt;''Hong Kong – The Facts: Police''&lt;/ref&gt;  Police actions regularly target organised crime, including raids on triad-controlled entertainment establishments and undercover work.&lt;ref name=hks20110121natalie/&gt;

====Canada====
The Guns and Gangs Unit of the [[Toronto Police Service]] is responsible for handling triads in the city. The Asian Gang Unit of the Metro Toronto Police was formerly responsible for dealing with triad-related matters, but a larger unit was created to deal with the broad array of ethnic gangs.

At the national (and, in some cases, provincial) level, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]'s Organized Crime Branch is responsible for investigating gang-related activities (including triads). The [[Canada Border Services Agency]] Organized Crime Unit works with the RCMP to detain and remove non-Canadian triad members. Asian gangs are found in many cities, primarily Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton.

The Organized Crime and Law Enforcement Act provides a tool for police forces in Canada to handle organized criminal activity. The act enhances the general role of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] (with amendments to deal with organized crime) in dealing with criminal triad activities. Asian organized-crime groups were ranked the fourth-greatest organized-crime problem in Canada, behind outlaw motorcycle clubs, aboriginal crime groups and Indo-Canadian crime groups.

In 2011, it was estimated that criminal gangs associated with triads controlled 90 percent of the heroin trade in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/police/CrimeMaps/|title=Crime Heat Maps - Vancouver Police Department|author=|date=|website=vancouver.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008202144/http://vancouver.ca/police/crimemaps/|archivedate=8 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its geographic and demographic characteristics, Vancouver is the point of entry into North America for much of the heroin produced in Southeast Asia (much of the trade controlled by international organized-crime groups associated with triads). From 2006 to 2014, Southeast, East and South Asians accounted for 21 percent of gang deaths in British Columbia (trailing only Caucasians, who made up 46.3 percent of gang deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1403433/hong-kong-triads-supply-meth-ingredients-mexican-drug-cartels|title=Hong Kong triads supply meth ingredients to Mexican drug cartels|author=|date=|website=scmp.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405232538/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1403433/hong-kong-triads-supply-meth-ingredients-mexican-drug-cartels|archivedate=5 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unitedgangs.com/2013/01/01/14k-triad/|title=14K Triad|author=|date=1 January 2013|website=unitedgangs.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628222411/https://unitedgangs.com/2013/01/01/14k-triad/|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Legislative measures}}Legislation===
Primary laws addressing the triad problem are the Societies Ordinance and the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance. The former, enacted in 1949 to outlaw triads in Hong Kong, stipulates that any person convicted of being (or claiming to be) an officeholder or managing (or assisting in the management) of a triad can be fined up to HK$1 million and imprisoned for up to 15 years.&lt;ref name=hks20110121natalie/&gt;

The power of triads has also diminished due to the 1974 establishment of the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]]. The commission targeted corruption in police departments linked with triads.&lt;ref name=hks20110121natalie/&gt;
Being a member of a triad is an offence punishable by fines ranging from HK$100,000 to HK$250,000 and three to seven years imprisonment under an ordinance enacted in Hong Kong in 1994,&lt;ref name=hks20110121natalie/&gt; which aims to provide police with special investigative powers, provide heavier penalties for organized-crime activities and authorize the courts to confiscate the proceeds of such crimes.

'''''Vaasi yoga''''' ('''''vasi yoga''''') is a form of [[yoga]] that concentrates on the breath ''[[Nadi (yoga)|naadi]]'' (''nadi''), the cycle of the distribution of oxygen throughout the body, that occurs as part of the breathing process. Indian philosophy describes ''[[prana]]'' (life force) as flowing in channels called naadis. Vaasi yoga attempts to heal the body and sprirt by cleansing the breath naadi, and thus prepare for balance, true consciousness of self and then enlightenment.  As such it is one of the ''kaaya kalpa'', the class of ancient yogic rejuvenation therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Pinkham, Mark Amaru |year=2011 |title=The Return of the Serpents of Wisdom|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IspS46HFPv0C&amp;pg=PT134 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a yogic practice it is an art of living taught by [[siddhar]]s for over 3000 years ago, as initiated by [[Lord Shiva]]. Like other advanced types of yoga which should be practiced only under the guidance of [[Guru]]. Vaasi yoga is practiced by very few.

''Vaasi yogam'' is the attainment of [[consciousness]] about the silent sound in our breath. To attain this consciousness, the body should be devoid of any waste. To remove all the waste from one’s body, one should be taught with [[asanas]] by a guru who should be in a position to analyze the ''naadi'' functionality of one’s body.  A guru who has the capacity to analyze the ''naadi'' functionality is called Siva Sithan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngobikannan.com www.ngobikannan.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misconceptions about Vaasi yoga ==
There has been lot of reference of this yoga to [[kriya yoga]] or kundalini pranayama (Yogic Breathing to increase the pranic energy). But all of the above practices are being followed or taught, without empowering the body to practice it. In other words, when the [[Human body|physique]] is not devoid of waste and when one with such a physique, practices any kind of yoga or breathing techniques, it will only aggravate the body conditions due to the heat or [[agni]] produced. All other kinds of yoga do not tend to remove the waste from the body, instead only rise the body temperature and increase the appetite. But in Vaasi yoga, food intake gets controlled automatically and one can control the appetite for food casually.

== Naadi and Vaasi Yoga ==
Our body cells need oxygen derived from air. There are some definite paths for oxygen to reach the cells and to go out of cells. These paths have some energy centres. These centres control the organs and their functions.  This pattern, this throb, which is called ‘Naadi’ in Tamil, differs from person to person. The pulse beat should be not taken for ‘Naadi’.
For a healthy living the Naadi has to function properly and be fully active. The imbalance in the Naadi functionality is the root cause of all ailments and diseases. By practicing Vaasi Yoga Naadi functionality gets strengthened and healthy living is achieved.
Vaasi Yoga is a technique to breath. The yogis who are expert in vaasi yoga avoids breathing through normal nostrils. But they exhale the air upward towards kapala (Brain). This strengthens the brain and give brightness to face and whole body too. Siddhar Shiva vaakiyar (Tamil Nadu) has narrated the secret of Vaasi yoga and its benefit.

== Stages in Vaasi Yoga ==
Vaasi Yoga has unique nature of attaining the consciousness of the Self, by the following stages.

#Analysis of Nadi functionality – Guru must have the capacity to identify the imbalance between the 3 Nadis’ Idakalai, Pingalai and Sulumunai. The reason being, each individual is unique in nature and the functioning of the body will vary due to the imbalance in these 3 Nadis. The body temperature might be different for every individual based on Vatham, Pitham and Kabam. Hence, that has to be brought under control to a stable level before practicing any kind of yoga .
#Asanas to empower body – Based on the above analysis, Guru must have the capacity to teach breathing techniques and asanas to bring the body and breath to a stable condition devoid of any waste. During this period 5 kinds of waste disposal happens. Motion, urine, sweat, mucous and gas. This will happen for minimum of 3 months. Only at the end of 3 months with devoid of all the waste from the body, the breath will be in control. Only when breath is under control, Vaasi can act upon us. 
#Realizing self -  Only through Vaasi Yoga, one can attain the consciousness of the true Self.  Another benefit of Vaasi yoga is being younger in appearance. Because Vaasi yoga will burn out all the waste in our body and will only look leaner and younger without any excess muscles in our body . This is the reason why Siddhars lived for years together.

== Scientific Reason ==
Vaasi Yoga practice simulates two special hormones 1. Seratonin 2. Melatonin. These two hormones ultimately stabilizes all the working systems in our body. They also help in experiencing the spiritual feeling in our body.

== Reference in Siddhar Songs ==

"முத்தியடா மந்திரத்தை நினைக்கும்போது
     மோசமடா மனந்தானும் இரண்டாய்ப் போகும்
சக்தியடா மனந்தானே யோக மாகத்
     தனித்திருந்து நித்திரையைத் தள்ளி மைந்தா!
புத்தியடா பிரமத்திற் புகுந்து கொண்டாற்
     பூலோக மெல்லந்தான் பணியு முன்னே;
எத்தியே திரியாமற் பிடரி மார்க்கம்
     ஏறுகின்ற வாசியுந்தான் கற்பந் தானே"
- Emphases that, Vaasi Yoga is the only means to attain true consciousness.

“விளையாடிக் கருநெல்லி பறித்தே உண்ணு
     வேகாத தலையாகும் விரும்பிப்பாரு
மலையாமல் வொண்சாரை பிடித்தே யுண்ணு
     மைந்தனே சாகாக்கா லதுவே யாகும்
அலையாமல் சோதியதன் பாலை யுண்ணே
     அக்கினியாம் கம்பமடா சுழுமுனை யாச்சுக்
கலைநாலு போகிறதை யெட்டிற் சேரு
     கபடமற்ற தேகமடா கண்டு பாரே”
- This verse talks about how one can control unfair sexual intentions by practicing Vaasi Yoga through rising Kundalini Energy.

“நேரப்பா நெடுந்தூரம் போகும்போது
     நிச்சயமாய்க் கம்பத்தின் நிலையைக் கண்டேன்;
வீரப்பா அக்கினி போல் படர்ந்து நிற்கும்
     வெளியொன்றுந் தெரியாம லிருக்குந்தானே”

“இருக்குமடா எங்குமொன்றாய் அக்கினிக் கம்பம்
     என்மகனே கம்பத்தின் நடுவே மைந்தா
உருக்கமுடன் பெண்ணரசி யொன்றி நிற்பாள்”
- These verses talk about the importance of Sulumunai Nadi, which is described as Rod of Fire.

“சாற்றுகிறே னென்மகனே வாசி நாதா
     சத்தியமா யண்டத்திற் செல்லும் போது
போற்றுகிற அக்கினியு
     புலன்களைந்துஞ் சேர்ந்ததனாற் போத மாகும்
மாற்றிலையும் அதிகமடா வுன்றன் தேகம்
     மைந்தனே அபுரூப மாகுமப்பா
வாற்றியே நிழற் சாய்கை யற்றுப் போகும்
     வலுத்ததடா காயசித்தி யாச்சப் பாரே”
- This verse talks about how Vaasi Yoga will help in attaining unbelievable powers.


Guruve saranam Guruvadeye saranam.
                                     Kinnimangalam Maha Guru aeganathar ayya avargaluke samarpanam.
Vaasi unarnthavan thanai unarukeran.
Vaasi yoga 3 vagai padum.
athuve sanibagavan vaganamahavum, muruganin vaganamahavum, eruthiyaga sivanin kaluthilum ular.
Vaasi Vaasi endru marupadeyum marupadeyum kooru vaasi yogathin oru mukeya mantheram velipadum.
                                    Guruve saranam Guruvadeye saranam.
                                     Kinnimangalam Maha Guru Mahan aeganathar ayya avargaluke samarpanam.

== Reference in Karunamirtha Sagaram ==

“நூறிலேறு போதிலாறு கேணியாகும் விந்தடா
     நூறு நூறு சேருமாகின் மாரிபெய்யு மாறடா
வேறுமீச னேதுஞான வீதியேறு போதிலே
     வேதனாளு மாயனாளு மீசனாளும் வாசமாய்
கூறுநாவ தேதடாசொன் மூல நாடி யூதவே
     கோணமாமூ வாச லேறப் பாழின் மீதி லேறடா
சரடா கணேசர்பாத கேசராதி வீதியிற்
     சாருசேரு தாரக சதாசிவாய பிரம்மமே”

The essence of this verse is that, one who practices Vaasi Yoga can live for more than 100 years easily. Because, through Vaasi Yoga, the breathing will be slow. Only if the breathing becomes slow, one can live longer and healthier.
