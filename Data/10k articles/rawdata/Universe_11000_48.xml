[[File:FAA-8083-3A Fig 12-1.PNG|thumb|right|An [[airspeed indicator]] is a [[flight instrument]] that displays airspeed. This airspeed indicator has standardized markings for a multiengine [[airplane]].]]
[[File:ILA-Pitotrohr.jpg|thumb|Aircraft have [[pitot tube]]s for measuring airspeed.]]

'''Airspeed''' is the [[speed]] of an [[aircraft]] relative to the [[air]]. Among the common conventions for qualifying airspeed are indicated airspeed ("IAS"), calibrated airspeed ("CAS"), equivalent airspeed ("EAS"), true airspeed ("TAS"), and density airspeed.

Indicated airspeed is simply what is read off of an airspeed gauge connected to a pitot static system, calibrated airspeed is indicated airspeed adjusted for pitot system position and installation error, and equivalent airspeed is calibrated airspeed adjusted for compressibility effects. True airspeed is equivalent airspeed adjusted for air density, and is also the speed of the aircraft through the air in which it is flying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calpoly.edu/~rcumming/Airspeed.pdf |title=Airspeed Measurements |author=Russell M. Cummings |work=Aerospace Engineering Department |publisher=[[California Polytechnic State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calibrated airspeed is typically within a few knots of indicated airspeed, while equivalent airspeed decreases slightly from CAS as aircraft altitude increases or at high speeds.

With EAS constant, true airspeed increases as aircraft [[altitude]] increases. This is because [[air density]] decreases with higher altitude, but an aircraft's wing requires the same amount of air particles (i.e., [[air mass|mass of air]]) flowing around it to produce the same amount of lift for a given AOA; thus, a wing must move faster through thinner air than thicker air to obtain the same amount of lift.

The measurement and indication of airspeed is ordinarily accomplished on board an aircraft by an [[airspeed indicator]] ("ASI") connected to a pitot-static system. The pitot-static system comprises one or more [[Pitot tube|pitot probes]] (or tubes) facing the on-coming air flow to measure pitot pressure (also called [[stagnation pressure|stagnation]], total or ram pressure) and one or more static ports to measure the static pressure in the air flow. These two pressures are compared by the ASI to give an IAS reading.

==Indicated airspeed==
{{main|Indicated airspeed}}

[[Indicated airspeed]] (IAS) is the [[airspeed indicator]] reading (ASIR) uncorrected for instrument, position, and other errors. From current EASA definitions: Indicated airspeed means the speed of an aircraft as shown on its pitot static airspeed indicator calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic compressible flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://easa.europa.eu/ws_prod/g/doc/Agency_Mesures/Certification_Spec/decision_ED_2003_11_RM.pdf |title= Definitions and abbreviations used in Certification Specifications for products, parts and appliances |publisher= EASA |date= 5 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the former Soviet bloc, most airspeed indicators show the speed in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s (nautical miles per hour). Some light aircraft have airspeed indicators showing speed in statute miles per hour or kilometers per hour.

An [[airspeed indicator]] is a differential pressure gauge with the pressure reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed is derived from the difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or [[stagnation pressure]], and the [[static pressure]]. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a [[pitot tube|pitot-static tube]]. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the [[position error]] correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.

==Calibrated airspeed==
{{main|Calibrated airspeed}}
[[Calibrated airspeed]] (CAS) is indicated airspeed corrected for instrument errors, position error (due to incorrect pressure at the static port) and installation errors.

Calibrated airspeed values less than the [[speed of sound]] at standard sea level (661.4788 knots) are calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;V_c=A_0\sqrt{5\Bigg[\bigg(\frac{q_c}{P_0}+1\bigg)^\frac{2}{7}-1\Bigg]}&lt;/math&gt; minus position and installation error correction.

;where
:&lt;math&gt;V_c \, &lt;/math&gt; is the calibrated airspeed,
:&lt;math&gt;q_c \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamic pressure]] (inches Hg) sensed by the Pitot tube,
:&lt;math&gt;P_0 \, &lt;/math&gt; is 29.92126 inches Hg; static air pressure at standard sea level,
:&lt;math&gt;A_0 \, &lt;/math&gt; is 661.4788 knots;, speed of sound at standard sea level.

Units other than knots and inches of mercury can be used, if used consistently.

This expression is based on the form of [[Bernoulli's equation]] applicable to a perfect, incompressible gas. The values for &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt; are consistent with the [[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]] i.e. the conditions under which airspeed indicators are calibrated.

==Equivalent airspeed==

'''Equivalent airspeed''' ('''EAS''') is defined as the airspeed at sea level in the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] at which the (incompressible) [[dynamic pressure]] is the same as the dynamic pressure at the [[true airspeed]] (TAS) and altitude at which the aircraft is flying. That is, it is defined by the equation

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \rho_0 (\mathrm{EAS})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho (\mathrm{TAS})^2&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\rho\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density of air]] at the altitude at which the aircraft is currently flying;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is the density of air at sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere (1.225&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 0.00237 slug/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

EAS is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.

At [[international standard atmosphere|standard]] sea level pressure, CAS and EAS are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS diverges from EAS due to compressibility.

==True airspeed==

The '''true airspeed''' ('''TAS'''; also '''KTAS''', for ''knots true airspeed'') of an aircraft is the speed of the aircraft relative to the airmass in which it is flying. The true airspeed and [[Aircraft heading|heading]] of an aircraft constitute its [[velocity]] relative to the atmosphere.

===Uses of true airspeed===

The true airspeed is important information for accurate navigation of an aircraft. To maintain a desired [[ground track]] whilst flying in a moving airmass, the pilot of an aircraft must use knowledge of wind speed, wind direction, and true air speed to determine the required heading. See [[wind triangle]].

TAS is the true measure of aircraft performance in cruise, thus it is the speed listed in aircraft specifications, manuals, performance comparisons, pilot reports, and every situation when cruise or endurance performance needs to be measured. It is the speed normally listed on the flight plan, also used in [[flight planning]], before considering the effects of wind.

Since indicated airspeed is a better indicator of power used and lift available, true airspeed is not used for controlling the aircraft during taxiing, takeoff, climb, descent, approach or landing; for these purposes the [[Indicated airspeed]] &amp;ndash; IAS or KIAS (knots indicated airspeed) &amp;ndash; is used.

===Measurement of true airspeed===

[[File:True airspeed indicator-FAA.SVG|thumb|A mechanical true airspeed indicator for an airplane. The pilot sets the pressure altitude and air temperature in the top window using the knob; the needle indicates true airspeed in the lower left window.]]

True airspeed is related to the [[Mach number]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and [[speed of sound]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; by

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{TAS}=cM&lt;/math&gt;

Both the Mach number and the speed of sound can be computed using measurements of [[impact pressure]], [[static pressure]] and [[outside air temperature]].

At sea level in the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] (ISA) and at low speeds where air compressibility is negligible (and so a constant air density may be assumed), TAS equals CAS. Above approximately {{convert|100|kn|km/h}}, the compressibility error rises significantly.

In flight, it can be calculated using an [[E6B]] flight calculator or equivalent.

Since temperature variations are of a smaller influence, the ASI error can be roughly estimated as indicating about 2% less than TAS per {{convert|1000|ft|m|sigfig=1}} of altitude above sea level. For example, an aircraft flying at {{convert|15000|ft|m}} in the international standard atmosphere with an IAS of {{convert|100|kn|km/h}}, is actually flying at {{convert|126|kn|km/h}} TAS.

The '''Alberta Fish and Game Association''' ("AFGA") is a [[charitable organization]] dedicated to [[fish]] and [[wildlife]] [[Conservation movement|conservation]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Alberta]].[http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/sec/SrchInput03Render-e?bn=106693351RR0001]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The AFGA was founded in 1908 when a group of anglers and hunters first met in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. It now claims to have about 14,000 members province-wide.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070328224714/http://www.afga.org/content.html?identifier=memberships]

The AFGA is a founding member of a number of sister conservation organizations. In 1962, along with representatives of the 9 other provinces, it helped found the '''[[Canadian Wildlife Federation]] (CWF)'''. At the time it was felt that the organized hunters and anglers of Canada needed a national organization that would represent conservation. Today, it is still only the AFGA and its sister organizations from across Canada that constitute voting members of the CWF, although a significant amount of funds are raised from non-voting members.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1997, the AFGA was instrumental in the founding of the '''[[Alberta Conservation Association]] (ACA)'''. The ACA acts as a delegated administration organization at arms-length from government, and administers funds received primarily from the sale of hunting and fishing licenses. At the time, the provincial government was going through a significant reorganization, and $18 million that were in a designated fund for conservation were being threatened to be absorbed by the provincial Treasurer. As a representative of the hunters and anglers who pay into this fund, the AFGA continues to be involved with the ACA.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Asbestos insulating board''', also known as "AIB" or by the trade name "Asbestolux", was an [[asbestos]] containing board used in the building trade because of its excellent fire resistance and heat insulating properties. These boards were commonly used in the UK from the 1930s up until production was terminated in 1980. AIB tended to contain 25-40% asbestos, with [[amosite]] being the most common form of asbestos used, although a mixture of amosite and [[chrysotile]] was also common, and [[crocidolite]] was sometimes used in older boards and some marine boards.

AIB is softer, more porous and less dense than [[asbestos cement]]. This and the fact it contains between two and three times more asbestos than cement makes it far more [[friable]] and thus a greater health risk if the boards are disturbed or in poor condition.

'''Biological dispersal''' refers to both the movement of individuals ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], [[bacteria]], etc.) from their birth site to their breeding site ('natal dispersal'), as well as the movement from one breeding site to another ('breeding dispersal').
Dispersal is also used to describe the movement of [[propagule]]s such as [[seed]]s and [[spore]]s.
Technically, dispersal is defined as any movement that has the potential to lead to [[gene flow]].&lt;ref name=Ronce&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronce, O. |year=2007|title= How does it feel to be like a rolling stone?

The act of dispersal involves three phases: departure, transfer, settlement and there are different fitness costs and benefits associated with each of these phases.&lt;ref name=Bonte&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bonte, D. |author2=Van Dyck, H. |author3=Bullock, J.

Through simply moving from one habitat [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] to another, the dispersal of an individual has consequences not only for individual [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], but also for [[population dynamics]], [[population genetics]], and [[species distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunning, J.

Dispersal can be distinguished from [[animal migration]] (typically round-trip seasonal movement), although within the [[population genetics]] literature, the terms '[[migration (disambiguation)|migration]]' and 'dispersal' are often used interchangeably.

== Types of dispersal ==
[[File:Dispersal diagram.jpeg|thumb|Dispersal from parent population]]
Some organisms are motile throughout their lives, but others are adapted to move or be moved at precise, limited phases of their life cycles. This is commonly called the '''dispersive phase''' of the life cycle. The strategies of organisms' entire life cycles often are predicated on the nature and circumstances of their dispersive phases.

In general there are two basic types of dispersal:
; Density-independent dispersal: Organisms have evolved adaptations for dispersal that take advantage of various forms of kinetic energy occurring naturally in the environment. This is referred to as density independent or passive dispersal and operates on many groups of organisms (some [[invertebrate]]s, [[fish]], [[insect]]s and [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms such as [[plant]]s) that depend on animal [[dispersal vector|vectors]], wind, gravity or current for dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maguire Jr., B.|year= 1963|title= The passive dispersal of small aquatic organisms and their colonization of isolated bodies of water|doi=10.2307/1948560|jstor=1948560|volume=33|journal=Ecological Monographs|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nathan, R.|year=2001|title=The challenges of studying dispersal|url=http://bio.huji.ac.il/ese/PDFs/Nathan2001TREE.pdf|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02272-8|volume=16|issue=9|pages=481|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928204701/http://www.bio.huji.ac.il/ese/PDFs/Nathan2001TREE.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Density-dependent dispersal: Density dependent or active dispersal for many animals largely depends on factors such as local [[population]] size, resource [[competition]], [[habitat]] quality, and habitat size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Johst, K.  |author2=Brandl, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1997|title= The effect of dispersal on local population dynamics|doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(97)00112-9|journal= Ecological Modelling|volume=104|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowler&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bowler, D.

Due to population density, dispersal may relieve pressure for resources in an ecosystem, and competition for these resources may be a selection factor for dispersal mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Irwini, A.J.  |author2=Taylor, P.D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title= Evolution of Dispersal in a Stepping-Stone Population with Overlapping Generations|pmid=11162790|url=http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~peter/pdf/TPB%2058%2000.pdf|journal= Theoretical Population Biology|volume=58|issue=4|pages=321–8|doi=10.1006/tpbi.2000.1490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispersal of organisms is a critical process for understanding both geographic isolation in evolution through [[gene flow]] and the broad patterns of current geographic distributions ([[biogeography]]).

A distinction is often made between '''natal dispersal''' where an individual (often a juvenile) moves away from the place it was born, and '''breeding dispersal''' where an individual (often an adult) moves away from one breeding location to breed elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Ronce /&gt;

==Costs and benefits ==
[[File:Epilobium hirsutum - Seed head - 3.jpg|thumb|230px|Epilobium hirsutum - Seed head]]

In the broadest sense, dispersal occurs when the fitness benefits of moving outweigh the costs.

There are a number of benefits to dispersal such as locating new resources, escaping unfavorable conditions, avoiding competing with [[sibling]]s, and avoiding breeding with closely related individuals which could lead to [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=Bowler/&gt;

There are also a number of costs associated with dispersal, which can be thought of in terms of four main currencies: energy, risk, time and opportunity.&lt;ref name=Bonte/&gt;
Energetic costs include the extra energy required to move as well as energetic investment in movement machinery (e.g. wings). Risks include increased injury and mortality during dispersal and the possibility of settling in an unfavorable environment.
Time spent dispersing is time that often cannot be spent on other activities such as growth and reproduction.
Finally dispersal can also lead to [[outbreeding depression]] if an individual is better adapted to its natal environment than the one it ends up in. In social animals (such as many birds and mammals) a dispersing individual must find and join a new group, which can lead to loss of social rank.&lt;ref name=Bonte/&gt;

== Dispersal range ==

"Dispersal range" refers to the distance a species can move from an existing population or the parent organism. An [[ecosystem]] depends critically on the ability of individuals and [[populations]] to disperse from one habitat [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] to another. Therefore, biological dispersal is critical to the stability of ecosystems.

=== Environmental constraints ===

Few species are ever evenly or randomly distributed within or across [[landscapes]]. In general, [[species]] significantly vary across the landscape in association with environmental features that influence their reproductive success and population persistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Groom MJ, Meffe GK, Carroll CR |year= 2005|isbn=0-87893-597-5|title= Principles of Conservation Biology|place= Sunderland (MA)|publisher= Sinauer Associates, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin TE|year= 1998|title= Are microhabitat preferences of coexisting species under selection and adaptive? |journal=Ecology| volume=79|issue=2|pages=656–670|url=http://www.umt.edu/mcwru/personnel/martin/PDF%20Martin/Reprint550.pdf|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0656:AMPOCS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial patterns in environmental features (e.g. resources) permit individuals to escape unfavorable conditions and seek out new locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Turner MG, Gardner RH, O'Neill, Robert V |year= 2001|title= Landscape Ecology: In theory and practice, pattern and process|place= New York |publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-95123-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the organism to "test" new environments for their suitability, provided they are within animal's geographic range. In addition, the ability of a species to disperse over a gradually changing environment could enable a population to survive extreme conditions. (i.e. [[climate change]]).

As the climate changes, prey and predators have to adapt to survive. This poses a problem for many animals, for example the [[Southern rockhopper penguin|Southern Rockhopper Penguins]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cebc.cnrs.fr/publipdf/2003/TMEPS251.pdf|title = Geographic variation in the foraging behaviour, diet and chick growth of rockhopper penguins|last = Tremblay|first = Yann|date = April 11, 2003|journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series|doi = 10.3354/meps251279|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These penguins are able to live and thrive in a variety of climates due to the penguins' phenotypic plasticity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Penguin responses to climate change in the Southern Ocean|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x/abstract|journal = Global Change Biology|date = 2009-07-01|issn = 1365-2486|pages = 1618–1630|volume = 15|issue = 7|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x|first = Jaume|last = Forcada|first2 = Philip N.|last2 = Trathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are predicted to respond by dispersal, not adaptation this time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is explained due to their long life spans and slow microevolution. Penguins in the subantarctic have very different foraging behavior than the subtropical waters, it would be very hard to survive and keep up with the fast changing climate because these behaviors took years to shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dispersal barriers ===

A dispersal barrier may mean that the dispersal range of a species is much smaller than the species distribution. An artificial example is [[habitat fragmentation]] due to human land use. Natural barriers to dispersal that limit species distribution include mountain ranges and rivers. An example is the separation of the ranges of the two species of [[chimpanzee]] by the [[Congo River]].

On the other hand, human activities may also expand the dispersal range of a species by providing new dispersal methods (e.g., [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|ships]]). Many of them become [[invasive species|invasive]], like [[rat]]s and [[stinkbugs]], but some species also have a slightly positive effect to human settlers like [[honeybees]] and [[earthworm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/05/jamestown/charles-mann-text/2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal mechanisms ==

Most [[animal]]s are capable of [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] and the basic mechanism of dispersal is movement from one place to another. Locomotion allows the organism to "test" new environments for their suitability, provided they are within the animal's range. Movements are usually guided by inherited [[behavior]]s.

The formation of barriers to dispersal or gene flow between adjacent areas can isolate populations on either side of the emerging divide.  The geographic separation and subsequent genetic isolation of portions of an ancestral population can result in speciation.

=== Plant dispersal mechanisms ===
[[File:Bur Macro BlackBg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bur]]s are an example of a seed dispersion mechanism which uses a biotic vector, in this case [[animal]]s with [[fur]].]]
{{Main article|Seed dispersal}}
[[Seed dispersal]] is the movement or transport of [[seed]]s away from the parent plant. Plants have limited mobility and consequently rely upon a variety of [[dispersal vector]]s to transport their propagules, including both [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.  The patterns of seed dispersal are determined in large part by the dispersal mechanism and this has important implications for the demographic and genetic structure of plant populations, as well as migration patterns and [[species]] interactions.  There are five main modes of seed dispersal: gravity, wind, ballistic, water and by animals.

=== Animal dispersal mechanisms ===

==== Non-motile animals ====
There are numerous animal forms that are non—motile, such as [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[bryozoan]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, and [[oyster]]s. In common, they are all either [[ocean|marine]] or aquatic. It may seem curious that plants have been so successful at stationary life on land, while animals have not, but the answer lies in the food supply. Plants produce their own food from sunlight and [[carbon dioxide]]—both generally more abundant on land than in water. Animals fixed in place must rely on the surrounding medium to bring food at least close enough to grab, and this occurs in the three-dimensional water environment, but with much less abundance in the atmosphere.

All of the marine and aquatic [[invertebrate]]s whose lives are spent fixed to the bottom (more or less; anemones are capable of getting up and moving to a new location if conditions warrant) produce dispersal units. These may be specialized "buds", or motile sexual reproduction products, or even a sort of alteration of generations as in certain [[cnidaria]].

Corals provide a good example of how sedentary species achieve dispersion. Corals reproduce by releasing sperm and eggs directly into the water. These release events are coordinated by lunar phase in certain warm months, such that all corals of one or many species on a given reef will release on the same single or several consecutive nights. The released eggs are fertilized, and the resulting [[zygote]] develops quickly into a multicellular ''[[planula]]''. This motile stage then attempts to find a suitable substratum for settlement. Most are unsuccessful and die or are fed upon by zooplankton and bottom dwelling predators such as anemones and other corals. However, untold millions are produced, and a few do succeed in locating spots of bare limestone, where they settle and transform by growth into a '''''polyp'''''. All things being favorable, the single polyp grows into a coral head by budding off new polyps to form a colony.

==== Motile animals ====
{{main article|Animal locomotion|Animal migration}}
The majority of all animals are [[Motility|motile]]. Although motile animals can, in theory, disperse themselves by their spontaneous and independent locomotive powers, a great many species utilize the existing kinetic energies in the environment, resulting in passive movement. Dispersal by water currents is especially associated with the physically small inhabitants of marine waters known as [[plankton|zooplankton]]. The term plankton comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]], πλαγκτον, meaning "wanderer" or "drifter".

====Dispersal by dormant stages====
Many animal species, especially freshwater invertebrates, are able to disperse by wind or by transfer with an aid of larger animals (birds, mammals or fishes) as dormant eggs, dormant embryos or, in some cases, dormant adult stages. [[Tardigrades]], some [[rotifers]] and some [[copepods]] are able to withstand desiccation as adult dormant stages. Many other taxa ([[Cladocera]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]], [[Copepoda]] and so on) can disperse as dormant eggs or embryos. Freshwater [[sponges]] usually have special dormant propagules called [[gemmulae]] for such a dispersal. Many kinds of dispersal dormant stages are able to withstand not only desiccation and low and high temperature, but also action of digestive enzymes during their transfer through digestive tracts of birds and other animals, high concentration of salts and many kinds of toxicants. Such dormant-resistant stages made possible the long-distance dispersal from one water body to another and broad distribution ranges of many freshwater animals.

== Quantifying dispersal ==

Dispersal is most commonly quantified either in terms of rate or distance.

Dispersal rate (also called [[Net migration rate|migration rate]] in the [[population genetics]] literature) or probability describes the probability that any individual leaves an area or, equivalently, the expected proportion of individual to leave an area.

The dispersal distance is usually described by a '''dispersal kernel''' which gives the [[probability distribution]] of the distance traveled by any individual. A number of different functions are used for dispersal kernels in theoretical models of dispersal including the [[negative exponential distribution]],&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chapman, D.

== Consequences of dispersal ==
Dispersal not only has costs and benefits to the dispersing individual (as mentioned above), but it also has consequences at the level of the [[population]] and [[species]] as well.

Most populations have a patchy spatial distribution. Dispersal, by moving of individuals between different sub-populations, can increase the overall [[landscape connectivity|connectivity]] of the population, helping to minimize the risk of [[stochastic]] extinction, since if a sub-population goes [[extinct]] by chance, it is likely to be recolonized if the dispersal rate is high.
Increased connectivity can also decrease the degree of local adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lenormand, T. |year=2002|title= Gene flow and the limits to natural selection|journal= Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=17|issue=4|pages= 183–189|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02497-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clacton Spear''', or Clacton Spear Point, is the tip of a wooden spear discovered in [[Clacton-on-Sea]] in 1911.  It is 400,000 years old and the oldest known worked wooden implement.&lt;ref name=Allington&gt;Allington-Jones, L., (2015) ''Archaeological Journal'', 172 (2) 273–296 The Clacton Spear – The Last One Hundred Years&lt;/ref&gt;
==Description==
It is made of [[yew]] wood, shaped into a point, and when found was 387 mm long, 39 mm diameter and straight.  But drying out during the first decades of storage shrank it to 367 mm by 37 mm, and warped it slightly into a curve.  Treatment by wax impregnation in 1952 has apparently stabilized it.  At some time before this, the last 32 mm of the tip has broken off and had been re-attached by conservators.  This again came off in 2013 and was re-attached.&lt;ref name=Allington/&gt; It is on display at the [[Natural History Museum, London]] where its age is stated as 420,000 years.
Tests to reproduce it suggested that it had been formed by scraping with a curved flint tool of the type found on the same site, known as the [[Clactonian|Clactonian notch]].&lt;ref name=McNabb&gt;McNabb, J., (1989) ''Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society'' '''55''', 251-271 Sticks and Stones: A Possible Experimental Solution to the Question of how the Clacton Spear Point was Made&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and significance==
The discoverer was Samuel Hazzledine Warren, an amateur pre-historian, who had been looking for simple stone tools in a known [[Palaeolithic]] sediment.  He at first thought it to be an [[antler]], but presented it to the [[Geological Society of London]] as a spear tip.&lt;ref name=Geol&gt;''Proceedings of the Geological Society of London'' May 10, 1911, '''67''' xcix&lt;/ref&gt;  This identification was generally accepted for some time.  However, as it was not a whole spear and the great age meant that it was well before modern humans, many academics doubted that the amount of planning required (to manufacture a spear and use it for hunting) was within the cognitive capabilities of early hominids and argued it was a simpler tool such as a digging stick.&lt;ref name=Allington/&gt;  However, the discovery of several more complete spears about 300,000 years old,&lt;ref name=Schoch&gt;Schoch, W. H., Bigga, G., Böhner, U., Richter, P., &amp; Terberger, T., (2015) ''Journal of Human Evolution'' '''89''' 214&amp;ndash;225 New insights on the wooden weapons from the Paleolithic site of Schöningen&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Schöningen Spears]] in 1995 in Germany demonstrated this capability, and the Clacton Spear is today generally regarded as a spear point.&lt;ref name=Allington/&gt;

[[File:Cooper1.jpg|thumb|A cooper readies or rounds off the end of a barrel using a cooper's [[Adze|hand adze]]]]
[[File:Preparando una Barrica.jpg|upright|thumb|Assembly of a barrel, called "Mise en Rose" in French]]
A '''cooper''' is a person trained to make wooden casks, [[barrel]]s, vats, buckets, tubs, troughs and other staved containers, from timber that was usually heated or steamed to make it pliable. Journeymen coopers also traditionally made wooden implements, such as rakes and wooden-bladed shovels. Other materials, such as iron, were used as well as wood, in the manufacturing process.

==Etymology==
The word "cooper" is derived from [[Middle Dutch]] or [[Middle Low German]] ''kūper'' 'cooper' from ''kūpe'' 'cask', in turn from [[Latin]] ''cupa'' 'tun, barrel'.&lt;ref&gt;''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.'' 2002. 5th ed. Vol. 1, A–M. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt; Everything a cooper produces is referred to collectively as ''cooperage.'' A cask is any piece of cooperage containing a bouge, bilge, or bulge in the middle of the container. A barrel is a type of cask, so the terms "barrel-maker" and "barrel-making" refer to just one aspect of a cooper's work. The facility in which casks are made is also referred to as a cooperage.

===As a name===
In much the same way as the trade or vocation of [[smith (metalwork)|smithing]] produced the common [[English language|English]] [[surname]] [[Smith (surname)|Smith]] and the [[German language|German]] name [[Schmidt (surname)|Schmidt]], the cooper trade is also the origin of the English name [[Cooper (surname)|Cooper]]; [[French Language|French]] Tonnelier and Tonnellier; [[Greek Language|Greek]] Varelas ({{lang|el|Βαρελάς}}); [[Danish Language|Danish]] Bødker; [[German language|German]] [[Binder (surname)|Binder]], [[Fassbender]] or Fassbinder ({{lang|de|italic=no|Faßbinder}}, literally 'cask-binder'), [[Böttcher]] ('tub-maker'), [[Scheffler]], and [[Kübler]]; [[Dutch language|Dutch]] [[Kuiper]] and Cuypers; [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] [[Kubilius]]; [[Latvian language|Latvian]] [[Mucenieks]]; [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] [[Kádár]] and [[Bodnár]]; [[Polish language|Polish]] [[Bednarz]], [[Bednarski]], and Bednarczyk; [[Czech language|Czech]] [[Bednář]]; [[Romanian language|Romanian]] [[Dogaru]] and [[Butnaru]]; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] Bodnar, Bodnaruk, and Bodnarchuk, and [[Bondarenko]] ({{lang|uk|Бондаренко}}); [[Russian language|Russian]] and Ukrainian [[Bondarev]] ({{lang|ru|Бондарев}}) and [[Bocharov]] ({{lang|ru|Бочаров}}); [[Yiddish]] [[Bodner]]; [[Portuguese name|Portuguese]] Tanoeiro and Toneleiro; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Cubero]], Tonelero, and (via Greek) Varela; [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] Bachvarov ({{lang|bg|Бъчваров}}); [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] Bacvarovski ({{lang|mk|Бачваровски}}); [[Croatian language|Croatian]] Bačvar; and [[Italian language|Italian]] Bottai (from {{lang|it|botte}}).

==History==
[[File:Kuiperij Zuiderzeemuseum.jpg|thumb|Cooper at [[Zuiderzeemuseum]], [[Enkhuizen]], the Netherlands]]
[[File:HS 140 fol 64v Fassbinder 1518 (2).jpg|thumb|upright|Cooper's brands from 1518 as recorded in a civic register from [[Bozen]], [[South Tyrol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Obermair | first = Hannes | author-link = Hannes Obermair | contribution = Das Bozner Stadtbuch: Handschrift 140 – das Amts- und Privilegienbuch der Stadt Bozen | editor = Stadtarchiv Bozen | title = Bozen: von den Grafen von Tirol bis zu den Habsburgern | series = Forschungen zur Bozner Stadtgeschichte | volume = 1 | pages = 399–432 (415) | publisher = Verlagsanstalt Athesia | place = Bozen-Bolzano | year = 1999 | isbn =88-7014-986-2 | contribution-url = https://www.academia.edu/1282360/Das_Bozner_Stadtbuch_Handschrift_140_das_Amts-_und_Privilegienbuch_der_Stadt_Bozen }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Traditionally, a cooper is someone who makes wooden, [[Stave (wood)|staved]] vessels, held together with wooden or metal hoops and possessing flat ends or heads. Examples of a cooper's work include [[cask]]s, [[barrel]]s, [[bucket]]s, tubs, [[butter churn]]s, [[hogshead]]s, [[English brewery cask units#Firkin|firkin]]s, [[tierce (unit)|tierce]]s, [[rundlet]]s, [[puncheon (unit)|puncheon]]s, pipes, [[tun (unit)|tun]]s, [[butt (unit)|butts]], pins and breakers. Traditionally, a ''[[wikt:hooper|hooper]]'' was the man who fitted the wooden or metal hoops around the barrels or buckets that the cooper had made, essentially an assistant to the cooper. The [[Hooper (surname)|English name Hooper]] is derived from that profession. With time, many Coopers took on the role of the Hooper themselves.

[[File:RoscheiderHof-waldmuseum-kueferwerkstatt-2009.jpg|thumb|Cooper's workshop, [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]]]]
There were four divisions in the cooper's craft. The "dry" or "slack" cooper made containers that would be used to ship [[dry goods]] such as cereals, nails, tobacco, fruits, and vegetables. The "dry-tight" cooper made casks designed to keep dry goods in and moisture out. Gunpowder and flour casks are examples of a dry-tight cooper's work. The "white" cooper made straight-staved containers like washtubs, buckets, and butter churns, which would hold water and other liquids but did not allow shipping of the liquids. Usually there was no bending of wood involved in white cooperage. The "wet" or "tight" cooper made casks for long-term storage and transportation of liquids that could even be under pressure, as with beer. The "general" cooper worked on ships, on the docks, in breweries, wineries and distilleries, and in warehouses, and was responsible for cargo while in storage or transit.

[[File:FMIB 36328 Coopering - Before the voyage the casks to hold the oil are put together on the docks, stowed with the provisions of the voyage.jpeg|thumb|left|Coopering of casks on a dock for a whaling ship.]]
Ships, in the [[Age of Sail|age of sail]], provided much work for coopers. They made water and provision casks, the contents of which sustained crew and passengers on long voyages. They also made barrels to contain high value commodities, such as wine and sugar. The proper stowage of casks on ships about to sail was an important stevedoring skill. Casks of various sizes were used to accommodate the sloping walls of the hull and make maximum use of limited space. Casks also had to be tightly packed, to ensure they did not move during the voyage and endanger the ship, crew and cask contents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=75MUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=taylor+%22stowage+of+ship+cargoes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJko3ku-HdAhWYIIgKHX0oC2oQ6AEIJTAA Thomas Rothwell Taylor, ''Stowage of ship cargoes'', Government Printing Office, Washington, 1920, p.44.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whaling ships in particular, featuring long voyages and large crews, needed many casks – for salted meat, other provisions and water – and to store the whale oil. Sperm whale oil was a particularly difficult substance to contain, due to its highly viscus nature, and oil coopers were perhaps the most skilled tradesmen in pre-industrial cooperage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00253359.1996.10656617 Mark Howard, “Coopers and casks in the whaling trade, 1800-1850,” ''The Mariner’s Mirror'', 82 (4) November 1996, p.438.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whaling ships usually carried a cooper on board, to assemble shooks and maintain casks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=EjLXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=the+chronicles+of+the+early+american+industries+association+vol+41&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=The+whaling+cooper Charles Reichman, "The whaling cooper," ''The Chronicle of the Early American Industries Association'', 41 (4) December 1988, p.75.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coopers in Britain started to organise themselves as early as 1298.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coopers-hall.co.uk/history The Worshipful Company of Coopers - History]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Worshipful Company of Coopers]], one of the oldest [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] in London, still survives, although it is now largely a charitable organisation.

Prior to the mid-20th century, the cooper's trade flourished in the United States; a dedicated trade journal was published, the ''National Cooper's Journal'', with advertisements from many different firms that hoped to supply anything from barrel staves to purpose-built machinery.
[[Plastics]], [[stainless steel]], [[Pallet|pallets]], and corrugated cardboard replaced most wooden containers during the last half of the 20th century, and largely made the cooperage trade obsolete.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, coopers mostly operate barrel-making machinery and assemble casks for the wine and spirits industry.

In the United Kingdom, the trade of ''master cooper'' is dwindling; it is thought that the last remaining cooper company in England is a beer barrel manufacturer in [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England's last master cooper seeks apprentice|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/society/11810950/Englands-last-master-cooper-seeks-apprentice.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=23 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322142909/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/society/11810950/Englands-last-master-cooper-seeks-apprentice.html|archivedate=22 March 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are these England's last traditional craftsmen and women?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-28209518|accessdate=23 March 2016|work=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708035857/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-28209518|archivedate=8 July 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air density, like air pressure, decreases with increasing altitude. It also changes with variation in atmospheric pressure, temperature and [[humidity]]. At 101.325 kPa (abs) and 15°C, air has a density of approximately 1.225 [[Kilogram per cubic metre|kg/m³]] (0.001225 g/cm³, 0.0023769 [[Slug (unit)|slug]]/(cu ft), 0.0765 [[Pound (mass)|lb]]/(cu ft)) according to ISA ([[International Standard Atmosphere]]).

==Density of air calculations==

Depending on the measuring instruments used, different sets of equations for the calculation of the density of air can be applied.  Air is a mixture of gases and the calculations always simplify, to a greater or lesser extent, the properties of the mixture.

===Density of air variables===

====Temperature and pressure====
The density of dry air can be calculated using the [[ideal gas law]], expressed as a function of [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] and pressure:
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho = \frac{p}{R_{\rm specific} T} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho =&lt;/math&gt; air density (kg/m³)&lt;ref group="note" name="SInote01"&gt;In the SI unit system. However, other units can be used.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p =&lt;/math&gt; absolute [[pressure]] (Pa)&lt;ref group="note" name="SInote01"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T =&lt;/math&gt; absolute temperature (K)&lt;ref group="note" name="SInote01"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\rm specific} =&lt;/math&gt; [[specific gas constant]] for dry air (J/(kg·K))&lt;ref group="note" name="SInote01"/&gt;

The specific gas constant for dry air is 287.058 J/(kg·K) in [[International System of Units|SI]] units, and 53.35 ([[Foot (length)|ft]]·[[Pound-force|lbf]])/([[Pound (mass)|lb]]·[[Rankine scale|°R]]) in [[United States customary units|United States customary]] and [[Imperial units]]. This quantity may vary slightly depending on the molecular composition of air at a particular location.

Therefore:
*At [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] [[standard temperature and pressure]] (0 [[Celsius|°C]] and 100 k[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]), dry air has a density of 1.2754 [[Kilogram|kg]]/m³.
*At 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 101.325 kPa, dry air has a density of 1.2041&amp;nbsp;kg/m³.
*At 70 [[Fahrenheit|°F]] and 14.696 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]], dry air has a density of 0.074887 [[Pound (mass)|lb]]/[[Cubic foot|ft³]].
The following table illustrates the air density–temperature relationship at 1 atm or 101.325 kPa:
{{Temperature_effect}}

====Humidity (water vapor)====
{{Main|Humidity}}
The addition of [[water vapor]] to air (making the air humid) reduces the density of the air, which may at first appear counter-intuitive.
This occurs because the molar mass of water (18 g/mol) is less than the molar mass of dry air&lt;ref group="note"&gt;as dry air is a mixture of gases, its molar mass is the weighted average of the molar masses of its components&lt;/ref&gt; (around 29 g/mol).  For any ideal gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules is constant for a particular volume (see [[Avogadro's Law]]).  So when water molecules (water vapor) are added to a given volume of air, the dry air molecules must decrease by the same number, to keep the pressure or temperature from increasing.  Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas (its density) decreases.

The density of humid air may be calculated by treating it as a mixture of [[ideal gas]]es. In this case, the [[partial pressure]] of [[water vapor]] is known as the [[vapor pressure]]. Using this method, error in the density calculation is less than 0.2% in the range of −10&amp;nbsp;°C to 50&amp;nbsp;°C.
The density of humid air is found by:
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_{\,\mathrm{humid~air}} = \frac{p_{d}}{R_{d} T} + \frac{p_{v}}{R_{v} T} = \frac{p_{d}M_{d}+p_{v}M_{v}}{R T} \,
&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=wahiduddin_01&gt;[http://wahiduddin.net/calc/density_altitude.htm Shelquist, R (2009) Equations - Air Density and Density Altitude]&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{\,\mathrm{humid~air}} =&lt;/math&gt; Density of the humid air (kg/m³)
:&lt;math&gt;p_{d} =&lt;/math&gt; Partial pressure of dry air (Pa)
:&lt;math&gt;R_{d} =&lt;/math&gt; Specific gas constant for dry air, 287.058 J/(kg·K)
:&lt;math&gt;T =&lt;/math&gt; Temperature ([[Kelvin (unit)|K]])
:&lt;math&gt;p_{v} =&lt;/math&gt; Pressure of water vapor (Pa)
:&lt;math&gt;R_{v} =&lt;/math&gt; Specific gas constant for water vapor, 461.495 J/(kg·K)
:&lt;math&gt;M_{d} =&lt;/math&gt; Molar mass of dry air, 0.028964 kg/mol
:&lt;math&gt;M_{v} =&lt;/math&gt; Molar mass of water vapor, 0.018016 kg/mol
:&lt;math&gt;R =&lt;/math&gt; [[Gas constant|Universal gas constant]], 8.314 J/(K·mol)

The vapor pressure of water may be calculated from the [[saturation vapor pressure]] and [[relative humidity]]. It is found by:
:&lt;math&gt;
p_{v} = \phi p_{\mathrm{sat}} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;p_{v} =&lt;/math&gt; Vapor pressure of water
:&lt;math&gt;\phi =&lt;/math&gt; Relative humidity
:&lt;math&gt;p_{\mathrm{sat}} =&lt;/math&gt; Saturation vapor pressure

The saturation [[vapour pressure of water|vapor pressure of water]] at any given temperature is the vapor pressure when relative humidity is 100%.
One formula &lt;ref name=wahiduddin_02&gt;[http://wahiduddin.net/calc/density_algorithms.htm Shelquist, R (2009) Algorithms - Schlatter and Baker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; used to find the saturation vapor pressure is:

:&lt;math&gt;p_{\mathrm{sat}} = 6.1078 \times 10^{\frac{7.5 T}{T+237.3}} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T =&lt;/math&gt; is in degrees C.

:note:
:*This equation will give the result of pressure in [[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] (100 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]], equivalent to the older unit [[millibar]], 1 mbar = 0.001 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] = 0.1 kPa)

The partial pressure of dry air &lt;math&gt;p_{d}&lt;/math&gt; is found considering [[partial pressure]], resulting in:
:&lt;math&gt;
p_{d} = p-p_{v} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; simply denotes the observed [[absolute pressure]].

====Altitude====
[[Image:StandardAtmosphere.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Standard Atmosphere: '''''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = 101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa, '''''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = 288.15&amp;nbsp;K, '''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = 1.225&amp;nbsp;kg/m³]]

To calculate the density of air as a function of altitude, one requires additional parameters. They are listed below, along with their values according to the [[International Standard Atmosphere]], using for calculation the [[Gas constant|universal gas constant]] instead of the air specific constant:

:&lt;math&gt;p_0 =&lt;/math&gt; sea level standard atmospheric pressure, 101.325 k[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]
:&lt;math&gt;T_0 =&lt;/math&gt; sea level standard temperature, 288.15 [[Kelvin (unit)|K]]
:&lt;math&gt;g =&lt;/math&gt; earth-surface gravitational acceleration, 9.80665 m/s²
:&lt;math&gt;L =&lt;/math&gt; [[adiabatic lapse rate|temperature lapse rate]], 0.0065 K/m
:&lt;math&gt;R =&lt;/math&gt; ideal (universal) gas constant, 8.31447 J/([[Mole (unit)|mol]]·K)
:&lt;math&gt;M =&lt;/math&gt; [[molar mass]] of dry air, 0.0289644 kg/mol

Temperature at altitude &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; meters above sea level is approximated by the following formula (only valid inside the [[troposphere]], no more than ~18 km above Earth's surface (and lower away from Equator)):
:&lt;math&gt;
T = T_0 - L h \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The pressure at altitude &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;p = p_0 \left(1 - \frac{L h}{T_0} \right)^\frac{g M}{R L}&lt;/math&gt;

Density can then be calculated according to a molar form of the [[ideal gas law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho = \frac{p M}{R T} \,
&lt;/math&gt;
where:

:&lt;math&gt;M =&lt;/math&gt; [[molar mass]]
:&lt;math&gt;R =&lt;/math&gt; [[ideal gas constant]]
:&lt;math&gt;T =&lt;/math&gt; [[absolute temperature]]
:&lt;math&gt;p =&lt;/math&gt; [[absolute pressure]]

'''Downhole oil–water separation''' ('''DOWS''') '''technology''' is an [[Emerging technologies|emerging technology]] that separates [[oil]] and [[gas]] from [[produced water]] at the bottom of the well, and re-injects most of the produced water into another formation which is usually deeper than the producing formation, while the oil and gas rich stream is pumped to the surface. DOWS effectively removes solids from the disposal fluid and thus avoids [[injectivity]] impairment caused by solids plugging. Simultaneous injection using DOWS minimizes the opportunity for the contamination of underground sources of drinking water (USDWs) through leaks in tubing and casing during the injection process.

==Overview==
A DOWS system is installed at the bottom of an [[oil well]], it separates oil and water in the [[wellbore]]. The oil rich stream is brought to the surface while the water rich stream is pumped into an injection formation without ever coming to the surface. A DOWS system includes many components but the two primary components are an oil/water separation system and a pumping/injection system used to lift oil to the surface and inject the water into a deeper formation. Two basic types of DOWS systems have been developed, one type uses [[hydrocyclone]]s to mechanically separate oil and water and the other relies on [[gravity separation]] that takes place in the wellbore. Three basic types of pumping/injection systems are used with the DOWS technology. These include [[electrical submersible pump]]s, [[progressive cavity pump]]s and sucker rod pumps. Hydrocyclone separators are usually used with the electrical submersible pumps because of higher [[Drawdown (hydrology)|drawdown]] created with effective injection of water into the lower zone.

==Advantages==
#Lower cost of oil production: DOWS technology reduces more than 70% of the water that was supposed to be produced thereby reducing the total cost of lifting, treating, re-injecting and disposal of produced water, the cost of [[Oil production|production of oil]] is greatly reduced.
#Reduction of environmental impact of oil and gas operations: Standard [[injection well]] operations pose a significant but manageable risk of [[environmental pollution]]. The highest risks occur due to surface spills during re-injection of the separated brine. By reducing the amount of [[brine]] brought to the surface and re-injected the environmental risks associated with re-injection wells can be reduced.
#Pollution of underground sources of drinking water: produced water in most cases contains brines. With DOWS technology, dissolved impurities are not allowed to get to the surface hence they do not pass through intervals containing underground sources of drinking water (USDW). Also, since the water does not require re-injection from the surface, it will not pass through intervals of USDWs then, either. Therefore, the risks posed by large volumes of these fluids passing USDWs both exiting and re-entering the well upon injection are minimized.
#Because DOWS technology uses underground equipment, surface brine disposal operations, which may involve [[pump]]s, [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s, tank batteries, and other storage facilities may also be reduced in size and extent if not altogether eliminated.
#The DOWS system is used for re-injection thereby beefing up the drawdown pressure which can result in increased production rate.&lt;ref&gt;Research by Aburime Conrad on Downhole Oil Water Separation Technology As A Means Of Downhole Water Control&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Argonne and ALL-LLC (Argonne National Laboratory and Arthur Langhus Layne-LLC), 2001, Analysis of Data from a Downhole Oil/water Separator Field Trial in East Texas, prepared by Argonne National Laboratory and Arthur Langhus Layne-LLC for U.S. Department of Energy, National Petroleum Technology Office, Feb.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16203">'''Helium atom scattering (HAS)''' is a surface analysis technique used in materials science.  HAS provides information about the surface structure and lattice dynamics of a material by measuring the diffracted atoms from a monochromatic helium beam incident on the sample.

== History ==
The first recorded He diffraction experiment was completed in 1930 by Estermann and Stern [1] on the (100) crystal face of [[lithium fluoride]].  This experimentally established the feasibility of atom diffraction when the [[de Broglie wavelength]], λ, of the impinging atoms is on the order of the interatomic spacing of the material.  At the time, the major limit to the experimental resolution of this method was due to the large velocity spread of the helium beam.  It wasn't until the development of high pressure nozzle sources capable of producing intense and strongly monochromatic beams in the 1970s that HAS gained popularity for probing surface structure.  Interest in studying the collision of rarefied gases with solid surfaces was helped by a connection with aeronautics and space problems of the time.  Plenty of studies showing the fine structures in the diffraction pattern of materials using helium atom scattering were published in the 1970s.  However, it wasn't until a third generation of nozzle beam sources was developed, around 1980, that studies of surface phonons could be made by helium atom scattering.  These nozzle beam sources were capable of producing helium atom beams with an energy resolution of less than 1meV, making it possible to explicitly resolve the very small energy changes resulting from the inelastic collision of a helium atom with the vibrational modes of a solid surface, so HAS could now be used to probe lattice dynamics.  The first measurement of such a surface phonon dispersion curve was reported in 1981 [3], leading to a renewed interest in helium atom scattering applications, particularly for the study of surface dynamics.

== Basic principles ==

=== Surface sensitivity ===

Generally speaking, surface bonding is different from the bonding within the bulk of a material.  In order to accurately model and describe the surface characteristics and properties of a material, it is necessary to understand the specific bonding mechanisms at work at the surface.  To do this, one must employ a technique that is able to probe only the surface, we call such a technique "surface-sensitive".  That is, the 'observing' particle (whether it be an electron, a neutron, or an atom) needs to be able to only 'see' (gather information from) the surface.  If the penetration depth of the incident particle is too deep into the sample, the information it carries out of the sample for detection will contain contributions not only from the surface, but also from the bulk material.  While there are several techniques that probe only the first few monolayers of a material, such as [[low-energy electron diffraction|low-energy electron diffraction (LEED)]], helium atom scattering is unique in that it does not penetrate the surface of the sample at all!  In fact, the scattering 'turnaround' point of the helium atom is 3-4 Angstroms above the surface plane of atoms on the material.  Therefore, the information carried out in the scattered helium atom comes solely from the very surface of the sample.  
A visual comparison of helium scattering and electron scattering is shown below:

[[Image:helium atom scattering 1.jpg]]

Helium at thermal energies can be modeled classically as scattering from a hard potential wall, with the location of scattering points representing a constant electron density surface.  Since single scattering dominates the helium-surface interactions, the collected helium signal easily gives information on the surface structure without the complications of considering multiple electron scattering events (such as in LEED).

=== Scattering mechanism ===

A qualitative sketch of the elastic one-dimensional interaction potential between the incident helium atom and an atom on the surface of the sample is shown here:

[[Image:helium atom scattering 2.jpg]]

This potential can be broken down into an attractive portion due to Van der Waals forces, which dominates over large separation distances, and a steep repulsive force due to electrostatic repulsion of the positive nuclei, which dominates the short distances.  To modify the potential for a two-dimensional surface, a function is added to describe the surface atomic corrugations of the sample.  The resulting three-dimensional potential can be modeled as a corrugated Morse potential as [4]:

:&lt;math&gt;V(z)=D \big\{exp \left[-2\alpha (z-z_m)\right] - 2 exp \left[-\alpha(z-z_m&gt;)\right]\big\} + 2\beta D exp \left[2 \alpha (z-z_m) \right] \xi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is for the laterally-averaged surface potential - a potential well with a depth D at the minimum of z = z&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and a fitting parameter α, and the second term is the repulsive potential modified by the corrugation function, ξ(x,y), with the same periodicity as the surface and fitting parameter β.

Helium atoms, in general, can be scattered either elastically (with no energy transfer to or from the crystal surface) or inelastically through excitation or deexcitation of the surface vibrational modes (phonon creation or annihilation).  Each of these scattering results can be used in order to study different properties of a material's surface.

=== Why use helium atoms? ===

There are several advantages to using helium atoms as compared with x-rays, neutrons, and electrons to probe a surface and study its structures and phonon dynamics.  As mentioned previously, the lightweight helium atoms at thermal energies do not penetrate into the bulk of the material being studied.  This means that in addition to being strictly surface-sensitive they are truly non-destructive to the sample.  Their [[de Broglie wavelength]] is also on the order of the interatomic spacing of materials, making them ideal probing particles.  Since they are neutral, helium atoms are insensitive to surface charges.  As a noble gas, the helium atoms are chemically inert.  When used at thermal energies, as is the usual scenario, the helium atomic beam is an inert probe (chemically, electrically, magnetically, and mechanically).  It is therefore capable of studying the surface structure and dynamics of a wide variety of materials, including those with reactive or metastable surfaces.  A helium atom beam can even probe surfaces in the presence of electromagnetic fields and during ultra-high vacuum surface processing without interfering with the ongoing process.  Because of this, helium atoms can be useful to make measurements of sputtering or annealing, and adsorbate layer depositions.  Finally, because the thermal helium atom has no rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom and no available electronic transitions, only the translational kinetic energy of the incident and scattered beam need be analyzed in order to extract information about the surface.

== Instrumentation ==

The accompanying figure is a general schematic of a helium atom scattering experimental setup.  It consists of a nozzle beam source, an Ultra High Vacuum scattering chamber with a crystal manipulator, and a detector chamber.  Every system can have a different particular arrangement and setup, but most will have this basic structure.  
[[Image:helium atom scattering 3.jpg]]

=== Sources ===

The helium atom beam, with a very narrow energy spread of less than 1meV, is created through free adiabatic expansion of helium at a pressure of ~200bar into a low-vacuum chamber through a small ~5-10μm nozzle [5].  Depending on the system [[operating temperature]] range, typical helium atom energies produced can be 5-200meV.  A conical aperture between A and B called the [[Skimmer (vacuum)|skimmer]] extracts the center portion of the helium beam.  At this point, the atoms of the helium beam should be moving with nearly uniform velocity.  Also contained in section B is a chopper system, which is responsible for creating the beam pulses needed to generate the time of flight measurements to be discussed later.

=== Scattering chamber ===

The scattering chamber, area C, generally contains the crystal manipulator and any other analytical instruments that can be used to characterize the crystal surface.  Equipment that can be included in the main scattering chamber includes a LEED screen (to make complimentary measurements of the surface structure), an Auger analysis system (to determine the contamination level of the surface), a mass spectrometer (to monitor the vacuum quality and residual gas composition), and, for working with metal surfaces, an ion gun (for sputter cleaning of the sample surface).  In order to maintain clean surfaces, the pressure in the scattering chamber needs to be in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.  This requires the use of turbomolecular or cryogenic vacuum pumps.

=== Crystal manipulator ===

The crystal manipulator allows for at least three different motions of the sample.  The azimuthal rotation allows the crystal to change the direction of the surface atoms, the tilt angle is used to set the normal of the crystal to be in the scattering plane, and the rotation of the manipulator around the z-axis alters the beam incidence angle.  The crystal manipulator should also incorporate a system to control the temperature of the crystal.

=== Detector ===

After the beam scatters off the crystal surface, it goes into the detector area D.  The most commonly used detector setup is an electron bombardment ion source followed by a mass filter and an electron multiplier.  The beam is directed through a series of differential pumping stages that reduce the noise-to-signal ratio before hitting the detector.   A time-of-flight analyzer can follow the detector to take energy loss measurements.

== Elastic measurements ==

Under conditions for which elastic diffractive scattering dominates, the relative angular positions of the diffraction peaks reflect the geometric properties of the surface being examined.  That is, the locations of the diffraction peaks reveal the symmetry of the two-dimensional [[space group]] that characterizes the observed surface of the crystal.  The width of the diffraction peaks reflects the energy spread of the beam.  The elastic scattering is governed by two kinematic conditions - conservation of energy and the energy of the momentum component parallel to the crystal:

E&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; =&gt; '''k'''&lt;small&gt;i&lt;/small&gt;² = '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;'''G'''&lt;/sub&gt;² = k&lt;sub&gt;'''G'''z&lt;/sub&gt;² + k&lt;sub&gt;||'''G'''&lt;/sub&gt;²

'''k'''&lt;sub&gt;||'''G'''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;||i&lt;/sub&gt; + '''G'''

Here '''G''' is a [[reciprocal lattice]] vector, '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;'''G'''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the final and initial (incident) wave vectors of the helium atom.  The [[Ewald's sphere|Ewald sphere]] construction will determine the diffracted beams to be seen and the scattering angles at which they will appear.  A characteristic diffraction pattern will appear, determined by the periodicity of the surface, in a similar manner to that seen for [[Bragg diffraction|Bragg scattering]] in electron and x-ray diffraction.  Most helium atom scattering studies will scan the detector in a plane defined by the incoming atomic beam direction and the surface normal, reducing the Ewald sphere to a circle of radius R='''k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''' intersecting only reciprocal lattice rods that lie in the scattering plane as shown here:

[[Image:helium atom scattering 4.jpg]]

The intensities of the diffraction peaks provide information about the static gas-surface interaction potentials.  Measuring the diffraction peak intensities under different incident beam conditions can reveal the surface corrugation (the surface electron density) of the outermost atoms on the surface.

Note that the detection of the helium atoms is much less efficient than for electrons, so the scattered intensity can only be determined for one point in k-space at a time.  For an ideal surface, there should be no elastic scattering intensity between the observed diffraction peaks.  If there is intensity seen here, it is due to a surface imperfection, such as steps or [[adatoms]].  From the angular position, width and intensity of the peaks, information is gained regarding the surface structure and symmetry, and the ordering of surface features.

== Inelastic measurements ==

The inelastic scattering of the helium atom beam reveals the surface phonon dispersion for a material.  At scattering angles far away from the specular or diffraction angles, the scattering intensity of the ordered surface is dominated by inelastic collisions.

In order to study the inelastic scattering of the helium atom beam due only to single-phonon contributions, an energy analysis needs to be made of the scattered atoms.  The most popular way to do this is through the use of [[Time-of-flight|time-of-flight (TOF) analysis]].  The TOF analysis requires the beam to be pulsed through the mechanical chopper, producing collimated beam 'packets' that have a 'time-of-flight' (TOF) to travel from the chopper to the detector.  The beams that scatter inelastically will lose some energy in their encounter with the surface and therefore have a different velocity after scattering than they were incident with.  The creation or annihilation of surface phonons can be measured, therefore, by the shifts in the energy of the scattered beam.  By changing the scattering angles or incident beam energy, it is possible to sample inelastic scattering at different values of energy and momentum transfer, mapping out the dispersion relations for the surface modes.  Analyzing the dispersion curves reveals sought-after information about the surface structure and bonding.  A TOF analysis plot would show intensity peaks as a function of time.  The main peak (with the highest intensity) is that for the unscattered helium beam 'packet'.  A peak to the left is that for the annihilation of a phonon.  If a phonon creation process occurred, it would appear as a peak to the right:

[[Image:helium atom scattering 5.jpg]]

The qualitative sketch above shows what a time-of-flight plot might look like near a diffraction angle.  However, as the crystal rotates away from the diffraction angle, the elastic (main) peak drops in intensity.  The intensity never shrinks to zero even far from diffraction conditions, however, due to incoherent elastic scattering from surface defects.  The intensity of the incoherent elastic peak and its dependence on scattering angle can therefore provide useful information about surface imperfections present on the crystal.

The kinematics of the phonon annihilation or creation process are extremely simple - conservation of energy and momentum can be combined to yield an equation for the energy exchange ΔE and momentum exchange '''q''' during the collision process.  This inelastic scattering process is described as a [[phonon]] of energy ΔE=ћω and wavevector '''q'''.  The vibrational modes of the lattice can then be described by the dispersion relations ω('''q'''), which give the possible phonon frequencies ω as a function of the phonon wavevector '''q'''.

In addition to detecting surface phonons, because of the low energy of the helium beam, low-frequency vibrations of adsorbates can be detected as well, leading to the determination of their potential energy.

Ice jacking is a continuous process during the winter in areas that are located by lakes. The process starts when the ice begins to crack followed by water filling in those gaps and the process continues until there is a wall of ice surrounding the lakes shoreline, sometimes reaching up to three feet. The formation of ice jacking allows for nutrients to get trapped in the ice creating organic fertilizer to create a buffer (transition between land and aquatic organisms) which collaborates with already existing plants on the shore line that contribute to the development of future organisms leading to the expansion of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rufer|first1=Moriya|title=The tremendous power of lake ice|url=http://www.pelicanlakemn.org/Education/Lake_Learning/tremendous_power_of_lake_ice.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However ice jacking is unfeasible{{Clarify|date=November 2018}} due to the lack of control over it. There are no methods that will prevent damages from ice jacking but there are a few defenses that can be used to fight against ice jacking such as building a riprap along the shoreline, attack its strengths/weaknesses, allow the natural process to take place and repair the damages later, or do nothing at all and let nature take its course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul|first1=Gerald L.|title=ICE POWER|url=http://www.lakehubert.org/Ice-Power.html.|website=The damage ice-Jacking can do}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ice shove]] is sometimes called ice-jacking.
* [[Frost heaving|Ice heaving]] or frost heaving is sometimes called ice-jacking.
* [[Ice wedging]] is sometimes called ice-jacking.

One difference between ice jacking and ice heaving is that ice jacking occurs in the middle of winter while ice heaving occurs in the early spring. When there is snow, the ice stays at constant temperature. When there is no snow, nothing can protect or cover the ice from the changing ambient temperatures.  When the temperature decreases, the ice will contract which causes cracks to occur in the ice which later are filled with the water from below. The ice expands once the temperature rises and the ice pushes up towards the shoreline since it does not have anywhere else to go. More pressure is put on the shoreline as the ice is jacked towards the shoreline. A solution to ice jacking should consist of sand shoreline. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Shoreline's Top 3 Enemies|url=http://www.lakeshoreguys.com/shoreline-top-3-enemies/|website=Lakeshore Guys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geologic engineering ==
Rock slope failures can occur due to the presence of water; ice jacking occurs when water between joint or fissure surfaces freezes and expands. This type of failure is progressive, resulting in incremental weakening over time, often requiring several cycles before failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Xanthakos |first1=Petros P. |last2=Abramson |first2=Lee W. |last3=Bruce |first3=Donald A. |title=Ground Control and Improvement |page=737 |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |year=1994 |isbn=9780471552314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice jacking is one form of rock [[erosion]]. In a 2005 study, middle size rock falls (10 to 100,000 m3) in the French Subalpine Ranges in an elevation ranging from 200 meters and 2000 meters above sea level were observed. Statistical analysis studied the triggering factors of 46 rock falls, investigating the rainfall, freeze-thaw cycles, and earthquakes in the region. Correlation was found between failure and freeze-thaw cycles, suggesting that ice jacking is a main triggering factor in rock falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Failure mechanisms and triggering factors in calcareous cliffs of the Subalpine Ranges (French Alps)|issue=4|pages=256–270|doi=10.1016/j.enggeo.2006.05.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013795206001700|journal=Engineering Geology|volume=86|date=2006-08-25|last1=Frayssines|first1=M.|last2=Hantz|first2=D.|citeseerx=10.1.1.382.9102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, on December 17, 2008 a Gondola tower on Blackcomb Mountain in Whistler, B.C collapsed as a result of ice jacking. The splice broke when the water entered into a section of the fourth tower and began to expand. This occurred around 2:30 pm, and left over fifty passengers stranded in sub-zero temperatures for hours. All of the passengers stuck in cabins on the Excalibur Gondola lift were rescued, with only twelve suffering from mild injuries. Many passengers recall watching in horror as the cars swung sideways, one dangling above the creek. It was apparent the first cabin to fall took the hardest hit, falling violently to the ground. Reports state none of the cabins actually came off of the cable, but that the strength of the cable had been significantly compromised. Following the incident, lift maintenance teams conducted inspections of all other towers to make sure there would be no other occurrence of ice jacking. After a second inspection by the British Columbia Safety Authority (BCSA), the lift were given approval to perform regularly again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice-Jacking Caused B.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">In aeronautics, '''inertia coupling''' is a potentially catastrophic phenomenon of [[high-speed flight]] in which the [[inertia]] of the heavier [[fuselage]] overpowers the aerodynamic stabilizing forces of the wing and [[empennage]]. The problem became apparent as single-engine jet [[fighter aircraft]] were developed with narrow [[wingspan]]s, that had relatively low roll inertia relative to the pitch and yaw inertia dominated by the long slender high-density [[fuselage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Description==
{{no references|section|date=March 2018}}
Inertia coupling occurs when an aircraft such as that described above is quickly put into a roll, resulting in violent pitching and yawing, and loss of control as the aircraft rotates on all three axes.

The phenomenon itself is not aerodynamic; it is caused by general [[conservation of angular momentum]] acting on mass whose [[radius|radial]] distribution is not symmetric about the [[axis of rotation]]. It can be visualized by imagining a uniform long rod, at each end of which is a perpendicular extension, each pointing opposite the other. (If the rod is horizontal, one points up and the other points down.) At the end of each extension is a weight. The extensions and weights are identical, so the center of mass and the axis of rotation along the length of the rod are unaffected by the weights. If the rod is then spun about its axis, the [[centrifugal force]]s on the two weights will cause the entire assembly to tilt relative to its initial axis of rotation.

Although a typical jet aircraft has most of its mass distributed close to its centerline, and the aerodynamics in planes designed to provide some stabilization (such that small fluctuations in control tend to return it to attitude equilibrium), it is important to remember that aircraft realistically always fly with a small non-zero random rate of yawing and pitching. Inertia coupling on an aircraft usually manifests itself as a downward pitching; rolling causes the tail mass to be flung upward and thus the nose to tip down. The pitching can in turn cause gyroscopic yawing.

==Early history==
Inertia coupling was essentially unknown before the introduction of high-speed jet aircraft. Prior to this time, aircraft tended to have greater width than length, and their mass was generally distributed closer to the [[center of mass]]. This was especially true for propeller aircraft, but equally true for early jet fighters as well. It was only when the aircraft began to sacrifice aerodynamic surface area in order to lower drag, and use longer [[fineness ratio]]s that lowered supersonic drag, that the effect became obvious. In these cases the aircraft was generally much more tail-heavy, allowing its gyroscopic effect to overwhelm the small control surfaces.

Inertia coupling at Mach 3.2 killed pilot [[Milburn G. Apt|Captain Mel Apt]] in his first flight in the rocket-powered [[Bell X-2]] on 27 September 1956, and had nearly killed [[Chuck Yeager]] in the [[Bell X-1|X-1A]] three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb | title = The story of Chuck Yeager's wild ride in the Bell X-1A | author = Dr. James Young | url = http://www.chuckyeager.com/wild-ride-in-the-bell-x-1a |website=chuckyeager.com |accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also extremely obvious in the [[X-3 Stiletto]] (first flown in 1952), and flight test data on this aircraft were used to examine the problem. The first two production aircraft to overtly experience this phenomenon, the [[F-100 Super Sabre]] and [[F-102 Delta Dagger]] (both first flown in 1953), were modified to increase wing and tail areas and were fitted with augmented control systems. To enable pilot control during dynamic motion maneuvers, for instance, the tail area of the F-102A was increased 40%. In the case of the [[F-101 Voodoo]] (first flown in 1954), a [[stability augmentation system]] was retrofitted to the A models to help combat this problem. The [[Lockheed_F-104_Starfighter#Design|Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] (first flown in 1956) had its [[stabilator]] (horizontal tail surface) mounted atop its vertical [[rudder]] fin to reduce inertia coupling.

An '''ionic liquid piston compressor''', '''ionic compressor''' or '''ionic liquid piston pump''' is a [[hydrogen compressor]] based on an [[ionic liquid]] piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal [[diaphragm compressor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermediates.basf.com/chemicals/web/en/function/conversions:/publish/images/products-and-industries/ionic-liquids/Achema_News_01_08.pdf New developments in pumps and compressors using Ionic Liquids]Dead link!&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
An ionic liquid compressor takes advantage of two properties of ionic liquids—their virtually non-measurable [[vapor pressure]]s and large temperature window for the liquid phase—in combination with the low solubility of some gasses (''e.g.'' [[hydrogen]]) in them. This insolubility is exploited by using the body of an ionic liquid to [[hydrogen compressor|compress hydrogen]] up to 1000 bar (14,500 psi)&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20140714-903222.html Linde AG: Linde starts small-series production for hydrogen fuelling stations]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[hydrogen station|hydrogen filling stations]]. [[The Linde Group | Linde]]'s ionic liquid compressor reduced the number of moving parts from about 500 in a conventional [[reciprocating compressor]] down to 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/08/flowserve-and-l.html Ionic liquid compressor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many seals and bearings were removed in the design as the ionic liquid does not mix with the gas. [[Service life]] is about 10 times longer than a regular reciprocating compressor with reduced maintenance during use, energy costs are reduced by as much as 20%. The heat exchangers that are used in a normal piston compressor are removed as the heat is removed in the cylinder itself where it is generated. Almost 100% of the energy going into the process is being used with little energy wasted as reject heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfcletter.com/issues/XXI_9/stories/739-1.html Linde Develops Ionic Compressor for More Efficient Compressed Hydrogen Storage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not to be confused with the [[ion pump (physics)|ion pump]] or the ionic [[liquid ring pump]].

'''Jardines de la Reina''' ({{lang-en|Gardens of the Queen}}) is an [[archipelago]] in the southern part of [[Cuba]], in the provinces of [[Camagüey Province|Camagüey]] and [[Ciego de Ávila Province|Ciego de Ávila]].

It was named by [[Christopher Columbus]] to honour the Queen of Spain, [[Isabella I of Castile]]. Since 1996 a marine reserve was established covering a large swath of the archipelago&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/jardinesdelareina/inicio|title=Jardines de la Reina|last=|first=|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.In 2010, Jardines de la Reina was established as a [[national park]] ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Jardines de la Reina}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=www.medioambiente.cu/legislacion/AC-CECM-6803.pdf|title=Legislacion Jardines de la Reina|last=|first=|date=2010|website=www.medioambiente.cu|publisher=Agencia de Medio Ambiente|language=es|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an area of {{convert|2170|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it is one of Cuba's largest protected areas.&lt;ref name=cnpc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pprincipe.cult.cu/santacruz/index.php?pag=vew_page.php&amp;page=69 |title=Jardines de la Reina |author=National Council for Cultural Heritage |accessdate=2007-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821001343/http://www.pprincipe.cult.cu/santacruz/index.php?pag=vew_page.php&amp;page=69 |archivedate=2007-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
It is located in the [[Caribbean Sea]], between the Gulf of Ana Maria (north-west), [[Gulf of Guacanayabo]] (south) and Caballones Channel (west). It extends on a general north-west to south-east direction, paralleling the Cuban coast for {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Cayo Breton to Cayos Mordazo. Cuba's second largest archipelago (smaller only than [[Jardines del Rey]]), it is formed by more than 600 [[cay]]s and islands. Other cays in the archipelago include Caguamas, Cayos Cinco Balas, Cayo Anclitas, Cayo Algodon Grande, Cayos Pingues and Cayo Granada. Part of the archipelago is also known as Laberinto de las Doce Leguas (The Labyrinth of the Twelve Leagues)

==Fishing==
The archipelago is a popular destination for [[Underwater diving|diving]] and sport fly-[[fishing]]. Only catch and release fly-fishing and a limited, well-regulated lobster fishery is allowed n the park, although many other fisheries occur suroounding the park and close to cays out of the park limits. It used to be one of Fidel Castro's favorite fishing spots. Species of fish found here include [[Cubera snapper]], [[Bonefish]], [[Yellowfin grouper]], [[Black grouper]], [[Atlantic goliath grouper]] as well as ''[[Strombus gigas]]'' (the large Caribbean [[conch]]) and [[Whale shark]].&lt;ref name=cnpc/&gt;
Besides being an extraordinary site for fly fishing, one its main attractions for diving is the abundance of reef sharks.

== Diving ==
Jardines de la Reina (The Gardens of the Queen) is one of the most popular scuba destinations of Cuba. The underwater landscapes include canyons, pinnacles and caves. Healthy [[mangrove]]s, sponges and [[black coral]]s cover the reef. The Jardines de la Reina also host numerous [[Silky shark|silky]] and [[Caribbean reef shark]]s. In the mangroves labyrinth it’s possible to find [[crocodile]]s and [[Snorkeling|snorkel]] with them.

'''Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen''' (5 January 1743 – 10 April 1808), was a French-born fortune-seeker best known as [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s least successful&lt;ref name=Morison&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Samuel Eliot |authorlink=Samuel Eliot Morison |title=John Paul Jones - A Sailor's Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hi44whI49akC&amp;pg=PA436 |accessdate=March 4, 2015 |year=1959 |publisher=[[Atlantic Monthly Press]] |isbn=978-1568524658 |pages=436 |quote=Nassau-Siegen failed in everything he undertook.}}&lt;/ref&gt; naval commander.

Charles Henry, in Catherine II's own words, "had everywhere the reputation of a crazy fellow". He sailed around the world with [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]], "fought tigers bare-handed" in Central Africa and reportedly seduced the Queen of [[Tahiti]]. His tiger hunt is the subject of [http://www.podil.com/history/history29.htm a vast canvas] by [[Francesco Casanova]].

== Life ==
He was the son of Maximilien Guillaume Adolphe of Nassau-Siegen (d. 1748) and his wife Amicie de Monchy (d. 1752).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siegen.de/standard/page.sys/details/eintrag_id=3671/content_id=3569/678.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Henry's family and title were disputed. His father was in 1756 posthumously recognized in France to be a legitimate son of [[Emmanuel Ignatius of Nassau-Siegen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/g_morganat.htm#Nassau-Siegen Morganatic and Unequal Marriages under German Law] [retrieved 7 March 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; in turn the youngest son of [[John Francis Desideratus of Nassau-Siegen|Prince Johan Franz of Nassau-Siegen]] by his third (and [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]]) wife, Isabella Clara du Puget de la Serre. Emmanuel Ignatius (d. 1735) had an unhappy union with the French noblewoman Charlotte de Mailly-Nesle (d. 1769) and became separated from her after a few years of marriage, during which they had two short-lived sons; years later (in 1722) they reconciled, and Emmanuel Ignatius recognized the third and only surviving son of his wife, the aforementioned Maximilien Guillaume Adolphe, as his own; however, shortly before his death (26 August 1734), he repudiated the child, declaring him [[adulterous]].

Citing descent from a princely dynasty in the [[patrilineality|male-line]], Charles Henry claimed that under French law he was entitled to style himself "Prince of Nassau-Siegen", but neither title nor rank was recognized by the [[House of Nassau-Siegen]] or the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which had declared his official grandfather, Emmanuel Ignatius de Nassau-Siegen, legitimate but born from a morganatic marriage.

Charles Henry entered the French Navy at the age of 15, but led a dissolute life as a gambler at the royal courts of Vienna, Warsaw, Madrid and Versailles.
Probably to escape his creditors, he joined the 1766 expedition of [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] to explore the South Pacific Ocean. On this expedition, he was able to develop his diplomatic skills in establishing contacts with the natives. For instance, in 1768 he was able to convince King Ereti of [[Tahiti]] of the peaceful intentions of the French.

As a French officer, Nassau-Siegen failed in his hastily prepared attack on the isle of [[Jersey]] (1779). For commanding the fireships at the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|siege of Gibraltar]], Nassau-Siegen received from [[Spain]] three millions of francs and the dignity of [[Grandee of Spain]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} At [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]] he met his future wife, a recently divorced Princess [[Sanguszko]], the owner of a small estate in [[Podolia]].

In 1786 Nassau-Siegen arrived in [[Russia]], seeking to make an impression on the powerful [[Prince Potemkin]]. He accompanied the Empress in her journey through the provinces of [[New Russia]] and was put in charge of the [[Dnieper Flotilla]]. After routing the Turks at [[Ochakov]], he wrote to his wife that the spectacle of the Turkish fleet was "better than a ball in Warsaw". [[File:Pałac Gozdzkich - de Nassau.jpg|thumb|left|Nassau-Siegen's palace in Warsaw]]

According to [[John Paul Jones]] (who served under Nassau-Siegen's command), the putative prince sought to exaggerate his success to the utmost. He won the [[Order of St. Andrew]] after the [[First Battle of Svensksund|Battle of Svensksund]] (1789) defeating the Swedes, but failed in stopping the Swedish fleet from breaking out in the [[Battle of Vyborg Bay (1790)|Battle of Vyborg Bay]] in July 1790.

He was on the 9th of July 1790 decisively defeated by the Swedes at the [[Battle of Svensksund|second Battle of Svenskund]]. Despite this defeat, Nassau-Siegen was promoted to admiral by the Tsarina. Nassau-Siegen's military incompetence&lt;ref name="Morison" /&gt; forced him to seek retirement. He left Russia in 1792 for the Rhine, to fight the French Revolution. But after the [[Peace of Amiens]] in 1802, he returned to France, where he solicited without success a position in Napoleon's army. He returned to Russia, to die at his estate at Tynna in Podolia in 1808.

The first plans of Russia's attack on [[India]] through [[Khiva]] and [[Bukhara]] are ascribed to Nassau-Siegen.

He had married in 1780 Polish Countess Karolina Gozdzka (1747-1807),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} but had no children.

'''Electric railways in Sweden''' are powered from a single-phase AC supply of 15 kV at {{frac|16|2|3}} Hz, as used in [[List of installations for 15kV AC railway electrification in Germany, Austria and Switzerland|Germany, Austria and Switzerland]].  Unlike these countries, the 132 kV traction current grid covers only part of the country,  approximately north of Stockholm. This grid is fed by [[frequency converter]]s and has no generation nor transmission lines from Norway, which uses the same traction current system. Formerly, the [[Porjus Hydroelectric Power Station]] provided electric power to the traction network. In the future the [[Älvkarleby Hydroelectric Power Station]] may be connected to the traction network, as this would increase stability of the power grid of the railway system.
Separate from the 132 kV grid is a 30 kV line connection between Mon and Varp substation north of Gothenburg.

Also the overhead wire system has some differences. It is common, that the pylons for the overhead wire also carry a three phase AC system. In order to reduce counts of substations, the voltage at the substations for the overhead wire is 32 kV at some lines (AT-System). However trains require 16 kV and therefore auto transformers are used, which have a central connection connected with the grounded railway, while the other connections are connected to the 32 kV output. The voltage between this central connection to the phase is 16 kV. The other pole to ground is also 16 kV, but with opposite polarity and runs along the track on the overhead wires until separation section. Other lines are fed directly with 16 kV from the substations. However differential transformers are used for feeding, in order to eliminate jamming signals.

'''Maximon''' – an hypothetical [[elementary particle]] of maximum mass in the mass spectrum of elementary particles having mass of 5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; [[Electronvolt|eV]]. Maximons can be electrically charged or neutral, they can have internal temperature of maximum or absolute zero, spin. They can look like black holes also.

Existence of maximons was postulated by Soviet academician [[Moisey Alexandrovich Markov|M. A. Markov]] in 1966.

'''Mean inter-particle distance''' (or mean inter-particle separation) is the mean distance between microscopic particles (usually [[atoms]] or [[molecules]]) in a macroscopic body.

==Ambiguity==

From the very general considerations, the mean inter-particle distance is proportional to the size of the per-particle volume &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., 
: &lt;math&gt;\langle r \rangle \sim 1/n^{1/3},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n = N/V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[particle density (particle count)|particle density]]. However, barring a few simple cases such as the [[ideal gas]] model, precise calculations of the proportionality factor are impossible analytically. Therefore, approximate expressions are often used. One such an estimation is the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]]
: &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{3}{4 \pi n} \right)^{1/3},&lt;/math&gt;
which corresponds to the radius of a sphere having per-particle volume &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;. Another popular definition is
: &lt;math&gt;1/n^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;,
corresponding to the length of the edge of the cube with the per-particle volume &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;. The two definitions differ by a factor of approximately &lt;math&gt;1.61&lt;/math&gt;, so one has to exercise care if an article fails to define the parameter exactly. On the other hand, it is often used in qualitative statements where such a numeric factor is either irrelevant or plays an insignificant role, e.g.,

* "a potential energy ... is proportional to some power n of the inter-particle distance r" ([[Virial theorem]])
* "the inter-particle distance is much larger than the thermal de Broglie wavelength" ([[Kinetic theory of gases|Kinetic theory]])

==Ideal gas==
===Nearest neighbor distribution===
[[File:PDF NN in ideal gas.svg|thumb|300px|PDF of the NN distances in an ideal gas.]]
We want to calculate [[probability distribution function]] of distance to the nearest neighbor (NN) particle. (The problem was first considered by [[Paul Hertz]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Let us assume &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles inside a sphere having volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;n = N/V&lt;/math&gt;. Note that since the particles in the ideal gas are non-interacting, the probability to find a particle at a certain distance from another particle is the same as probability to find a particle at the same distance from any other point; we shall use the center of the sphere.

An NN particle at distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; means exactly one of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles resides at that distance while the rest 
&lt;math&gt;N - 1&lt;/math&gt; particles are at larger distances, i.e., they are somewhere outside the sphere with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

The probability to find a particle at the distance from the origin between &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r + dr&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math&gt;(4 \pi r^2/V) dr&lt;/math&gt;, plus we have &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; kinds of way to choose which particle , while the probability to find a particle outside that sphere is &lt;math&gt;1 - 4\pi r^3/3V&lt;/math&gt;. The sought-for expression is then

:&lt;math&gt;P_N(r)dr = 4 \pi r^2 dr\frac{N}{V}\left(1 - \frac{4\pi}{3}r^3/V \right)^{N - 1} =
                \frac{3}{ a}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^2 dr \left(1 - \left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^3 \frac{1}{N} \right)^{N - 1}\, &lt;/math&gt;
where we substituted
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{V} = \frac{3}{4 \pi N a^{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the Wigner-Seitz radius. Finally, taking the &lt;math&gt;N \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; limit and using &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^x = e&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;P(r) = \frac{3}{a}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^2 e^{-(r/a)^3}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

One can immediately check that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty}P(r)dr = 1\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The distribution peaks at 
:&lt;math&gt;r_{\text{peak}} = \left(2/3\right)^{1/3} a \approx 0.874 a\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Mean distance and higher NN distribution moments===

:&lt;math&gt; \langle r^k \rangle = \int_{0}^{\infty}P(r) r^k dr = 3 a^k\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{k+2}e^{-x^3}dx\,,&lt;/math&gt;
or, using the &lt;math&gt;t = x^3&lt;/math&gt; substitution,
:&lt;math&gt; \langle r^k \rangle = a^k \int_{0}^{\infty}t^{k/3}e^{-t}dt = a^k \Gamma(1 + \frac{k}{3})\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gamma function]]. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle r^k \rangle = a^k \Gamma(1 + \frac{k}{3})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular,
:&lt;math&gt; \langle r \rangle = a \Gamma(\frac{4}{3}) = \frac{a}{3} \Gamma(\frac{1}{3}) \approx 0.893 a\,.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''mesophile''' is an [[organism]] that grows best in moderate [[temperature]], neither too hot nor too cold, typically between {{convert|20|and|45|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Joanne M., Linda Sherwood, Christopher J. Woolverton, and Lansing M. Prescott. Prescott, Harley, and Klein's Microbiology. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is mainly applied to [[microorganism]]s.  Organisms that prefer extreme environments are known as [[extremophiles]]. Mesophiles have diverse classifications, belonging to two [[domain (biology)|domain]]s: [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and to [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Fungi]] of domain [[Eukaryote|Eucarya]].  Mesophiles belonging to the domain Bacteria can either be [[gram-positive]] or [[gram-negative]]. Gram-positive bacteria have a cell layer made of [[peptidoglycan]] and stains purple. Gram-negative bacteria also contains peptidoglycan, yet the layer is extremely thin and stains red or pink. Oxygen requirements for mesophiles are not just confined to [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]]. There are three basic shapes of mesophiles: [[coccus]], [[bacillus]], and [[spiral]].

==Habitat==
The habitats of mesophiles can include [[cheese]] and [[yogurt]]. They are often included during fermentation of [[beer]] and [[wine]] making.  Since normal human body temperature is 37 [[celsius|°C]], the majority of human [[pathogens]] are mesophiles, as are most of the organisms comprising the [[human microbiome]].

== Vs. extremophiles==
Mesophiles are the opposite of [[extremophile]]s. Extremophiles that prefer cold environments are termed  [[psychrophile|psychrophilic]], those preferring warmer temperatures are termed [[Thermophile|thermophilic or thermotropic]] and those thriving in extremely hot environments are [[hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]].
A genome-wide computational approach has been designed by Zheng, et al. to classify bacteria into mesophilic and thermophilic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hao Zheng|author2=Hongwei Wu|title=Gene-centric association analysis for the correlation between the guanine-cytosine content levels and temperature range conditions of prokaryotic species|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|year=2010|volume=11|issue=Suppl 11|pages=S7|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-11-S11-S7|pmc=3024870|pmid=21172057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
All bacteria have their own optimum environmental surroundings and temperatures in which they thrive. Many factors are responsible for a given organism's optimal temperature range, but evidence suggests that the expression of particular genetic elements ([[alleles]]) can alter the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the organism. A recently published study demonstrated that mesophilic bacteria could be genetically engineered to express certain alleles from psychrophilic bacteria, consequently shifting the restrictive temperature range of the mesophilic bacteria to closely match that of the psychrophilic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pankowski|first1=Jarosław A.|last2=Puckett|first2=Stephanie M.|last3=Nano|first3=Francis E.|title=Temperature Sensitivity Conferred by ligA Alleles from Psychrophilic Bacteria upon Substitution in Mesophilic Bacteria and a Yeast Species|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=15 March 2016|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1924–1932|doi=10.1128/AEM.03890-15|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/82/6/1924.short|issn=0099-2240|pmid=26773080|pmc=4784036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the less stable structure of mesophiles, it has reduced flexibility for [[protein synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vijayabaskar, Mahalingam S. et al. "Construction of Energy Based Protein Structure Networks: Application in the Comparative Analysis of Thermophiles and Mesophiles" Biophysical Journal, Volume 98 , Issue 3 , 387a&lt;/ref&gt; Mesophiles are not able to synthesize proteins in low temperatures. It is more sensitive to temperature changes, and the [[fatty acid]] composition of the [[membrane]] does not allow for much [[Membrane fluidity|fluidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = K.Y. | last2 = Torres | first2 = J. A. | year = 1993 | title = EFFECTS of TEMPERATURE and SOLUTE ON the MINIMUM WATER ACTIVITY FOR GROWTH and TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTIC of SELECTED MESOPHILES and PSYCHROTROPHS | url = | journal = Journal of Food Processing and Preservation | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 305–318 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-4549.1993.tb00733.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreasing the optimal temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C to 0&amp;nbsp;°C to 8&amp;nbsp;°C leads to a gradual decrease in protein synthesis. [[Cold-induced proteins]] (CIPs) are induced during low temperatures, which then allows [[Cold-shock domain|cold-shock proteins]] (CSPs) to synthesize. The shift back to the optimal temperature sees an increase, indicating that mesophiles are highly dependent on temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot, F., Hébraud, M., Junter, G.-A. and Jouenne, T. "Protein synthesis in Escherichia coli at 4°C. Electrophoresis." 2000, 21: 1625–1629. doi:10.1002/(SICI)1522-2683(20000501)21:8&lt;1625::AID-ELPS1625&gt;3.0.CO;2-4&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen availability also affects microorganism growth.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, N. A. ; Stokes, J. L. " ROLE OF OXYGEN IN THE HIGH CELL YIELDS OF PSYCHROPHILES AND MESOPHILES AT LOW TEMPERATURES." The Journal of Bacteriology, 1963, Vol. 85(1), p.164 [Peer Reviewed Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two explanations for thermophiles being able to survive at such high temperatures whereas mesophiles can not. The most evident explanation is that thermophiles are believed to have cell components that are relatively more stable than the cell components of mesophiles which is why thermophiles are able to live at higher temperatures than mesophiles.&lt;ref name="Koffler 227–240"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koffler|first=Henry|date=2016-11-28|title=PROTOPLASMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MESOPHILES AND THERMOPHILES1|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|volume=21|issue=4|pages=227–240|issn=0005-3678|pmc=180904|pmid=13488883}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A second school of thought, as represented by the writings of Gaughran (21) and Allen (3), believes that rapid resynthesis of damaged or destroyed cell constituents is the key to the problem of biological stability to heat."&lt;ref name="Koffler 227–240"/&gt;

==Oxygen requirements==
Due to the diversity of mesophiles, oxygen requirements greatly vary. [[Aerobic respiration]] requires the use of [[oxygen]] and anaerobic does not. There are three types of [[anaerobes]]. [[Facultative anaerobes]] grow in the absence of oxygen, using [[fermentation]] instead. During fermentation, sugars are converted to [[acids]], [[alcohol]], or [[gasses]]. If there is oxygen present, it will use aerobic respiration instead. [[Obligate anaerobe]]s cannot grow in the presence of oxygen. [[Aerotolerant anaerobe]]s can withstand oxygen.

==Roles==
Microorganisms play an important role in [[decomposition]] of organic matter and [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of [[nutrients]]. In [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] environments, the diversity of the [[ecosystem]] allows for the diversity of mesophiles. The functions of each mesophile rely on the surroundings, most importantly temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;Ferroni, G.D., Kaminski, J.S. "Psychrophiles, psychrotrophs, and mesophiles in an environment which experiences seasonal temperature fluctuations." Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 1980, 26:1184-1191, 10.1139/m80-198&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacteria]] such as mesophiles and [[thermophile]]s are used in the [[cheesemaking]] due to their role in [[fermentation]]. "Traditional [[microbiologist]]s use the following terms to indicate the general (slightly arbitrary) optimum temperature for the growth of bacteria: [[psychrophile]]s (15–20 °C), [[mesophiles]] (30–37 °C), thermophiles (50–60 °C) and extreme thermophiles (up to 122 °C)".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Mark. "Mesophilic and Thermophilic Cultures Used in Traditional Cheesemaking." Cheese and Microbes. Washington: ASM Publishing. 2014. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Both mesophiles and thermophiles are used in cheesemaking for the same reason; however, they grow, thrive and die at different temperatures. [[Psychrotrophic bacteria|Psychrotrophic]] bacteria contribute to dairy products spoiling, getting mouldy or going bad due to their ability to grow at lower temperatures such as in a refrigerator.

==Examples==
Some notable mesophiles include ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Other examples of [[species]] of mesophiles are ''[[Clostridium kluyveri]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas maltophilia]]'', ''[[Thiobacillus novellus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', and ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above.

===''Listeria monocytogenes''===
''Listeria monocytogenes'' is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to ''Bacillus'' and ''Staphylococcus''. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous [[flagella]]. ''L. monocytogenes'' motility is limited from 20&amp;nbsp;°C to 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=LISTERIA/&gt; At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for [[listeriosis]] which derives from contaminated food.&lt;ref name=LISTERIA&gt;Magalhã£Es, R. (2014). Listeria monocytogenes. 450-461.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
''Staphylococcus aureus'' was first identified in 1880.&lt;ref name=AUREUS/&gt; It is responsible for different infections stemming from an injury. The bacterium overcomes the body's natural mechanisms. Long lasting infections of ''S. aureus'' includes [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]], and [[osteomyelitis]]. ''S. aureus'' is commonly contracted in hospital settings.&lt;ref name=AUREUS&gt;Todd, E. (2014). Staphylococcus Aureus. 530-534&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''muddy flood''' is produced by an accumulation of run-off over agricultural land . Sediments are picked up by the run-off and carried as suspended matter or bed-load. Muddy floods are typically  a hill-slope process, and should not be confused with mudflows produced by mass movements.

Muddy floods can damage the road infrastructure and may deposit layers of mud blanket and may also clog  sewers and damage private property.

It has been referred to 'muddy floods' since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, J. (1984). Soil erosion and flooding on downland areas. The Surveyor, 164, 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar designation appeared in French ('inondations boueuses'&lt;ref&gt;Auzet, A.V. (1987). L'érosion des sols cultivés en France sous l'action du ruissellement. [[Annales de Géographie]], 537, 529-555.&lt;/ref&gt;) during the same period.

== Muddy flood generation ==
[[Image:Cultures-Ath.jpg|right|thumb|Difference of soil cover by vegetation for two crops (winter wheat vs. maize) at the end of May, in central Belgium]]
Muddy runoff is generated on agricultural land when the soil surface is exposed or sparsely covered by vegetation. Large quantities of run-off usually generated by heavy storms is needed to start such a flood.&lt;ref&gt;Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., Bielders, C.L., van Wesemael, B. (2008). Seasonal evolution of runoff generation on agricultural land in the Belgian loess belt and implications for muddy flood triggering. Earth Surface Processes &amp; Landforms 33(8), 1285-1301.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Muddy flood occurrence ==
Muddy floods have been observed in the entire European [[loess belt]]. Other affected areas include [[Normandy]] and [[Picardy]] ([[France]]), central [[Belgium]] and southern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], the [[Netherlands]].

Muddy floods have also been observed in [[Slovakia]] and [[Poland]].

== Temporal evolution ==
An increase in muddy flood frequency has been observed during the last twenty years (e.g. in central Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;Evrard, O., Bielders, C., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B. (2007). Spatial and temporal variation of muddy floods in central Belgium, off-site impacts and potential control measures. Catena 70 (3), 443-454.&lt;/ref&gt;). This increase in their frequency may be due to a number of factors including:

* Change in agricultural practices that leave field bare of crops in the autumn and winter
* A shift to crops that are more sensitive to soil erosion;
* land consolidation (enlargement of fields, removal of landscape buffer elements such as hedges.
* construction of new houses, upstream of cropland increasing run-off volumes and intensity
* increased frequency of heavy rainfall.

== Control measures ==
[[Image:Chenal-beautemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway during a beautiful day in [[Velm]], Belgium]]
[[Image:Chenal-mauvaistemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in Velm, Belgium, after a thunderstorm]]

Preventive measures consist in limiting runoff generation and sediment production at the source. Alternative farming practices (e.g. reduced tillage) to increase runoff infiltration and limit erosion in their fields may assist.

Curative measures generally consist in installing retention ponds at the boundary between cropland and inhabited areas.&lt;ref&gt;Verstraeten, G., Poesen, J., (2001). The nature of small-scale flooding, muddy floods and retention pond sedimentation in central Belgium. Geomorphology, 29, 275–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative is to apply other measures than can be referred to as intermediate measures. Grass buffer strips along or within fields, a [[grassed waterway]] (in the thalwegs of dry valleys) or earthen dams are good examples of this type of measures. They act as a buffer within landscape, retaining runoff temporarily and trapping sediments.&lt;ref&gt;Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B., Bielders, C.L, 2008. A grassed waterway and earthen dams to control muddy floods from a cultivated catchment of the Belgian loess belt. Geomorphology 100, 419-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of these measures is best coordinated at the catchment scale.

'''Nicolas Antoine Boulanger''' (11 November 1722, Paris – 16 September 1759, Paris) was a [[France|French]] philosopher and [[man of letters]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Persee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Asteroid" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Born the son of a paper merchant in Paris, Boulanger studied first mathematics, and later ancient languages.  He composed several philosophical works in which he sought to come up with naturalistic explanations for superstitions and religious practices, all of which were published posthumously.  His major works were ''Research into the Origins of Oriental Despotism'' («Recherches sur l’origine du despotisme oriental», 1761) and ''Antiquity Unveiled'' («L’Antiquité dévoilée par ses usages», 1766). Boulanger's collected works were published in 1792.

The German-born [[Baron d'Holbach]] (Paul-Henri Thiry, 1723–1789) published his controversial anti-religious work ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]'' («Christianisme dévoilé», 1761), using Boulanger's name as his pseudonym, just two years after the philosopher's death.&lt;ref name="Room" /&gt; Boulanger also was one of the first modern critics of Paul.&lt;ref name=" Life of St. Paul" /&gt;

== Honours ==
The Koronian asteroid [[7346 Boulanger]], discovered in 1993, was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="MPC-Asteroid" /&gt;

[[File:Gas Control Systems, INC PSA.jpg|thumb|A nitrogen generator]]
'''Nitrogen generators''' and stations are stationary or mobile air-to-nitrogen production complexes.

[[File:Adsorbtion nitrogen generator.jpg|thumb|Adsorption nitrogen generator]]

== Adsorption technology ==

=== Adsorption concept ===
[[File:Adsorbtion nitrogen generator1.jpg|thumb|Adsorption nitrogen generator]]
The adsorption [[gas]] separation process in nitrogen generators is based on the phenomenon of fixing various gas mixture components by a solid substance called an [[adsorbent]]. This phenomenon is brought about by the gas and adsorbent molecules' interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brownfieldstsc.org/glossary.cfm?q=1 |title=Glossary |publisher=The Brownfields and Land Revitalization Technology Support Center |accessdate=2009-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pressure swing adsorption technology ===
The technology of air-to-nitrogen production with the use of adsorption processes in nitrogen generators is well studied and widely applied at industrial facilities for the recovery of high-purity nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to bury the problem|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2007/October/HowToBuryTheProblem.asp|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of Pressure Swing Adsorption|url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/tasks/?i=801|work=Human Research Roadmap|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operating principle of a nitrogen generator utilizing the adsorption technology is based upon the dependence of the adsorption rates featured by various gas mixture components upon pressure and temperature factors. Among nitrogen adsorption plants of various types, [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) plants have found the broadest application world-wide.

The system's design is based on the regulation of gas adsorption and adsorbent regeneration by means of changing [[pressures]] in two adsorber–adsorbent-containing vessels. This process requires constant temperature, close to ambient. With this process, nitrogen is produced by the plant at the above-atmospheric pressure, while the adsorbent regeneration is accomplished at below-atmospheric pressure.

The swing adsorption process in each of the two adsorbers consists of two stages running for a few minutes. At the adsorption stage oxygen, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules diffuse into the pore structure of the adsorbent whilst the nitrogen molecules are allowed to travel through the adsorber–adsorbent-containing vessel. At the regeneration stage the adsorbed components are released from the adsorbent vented into the atmosphere. The process is then multiplely repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do Pressure Swing Adsorption Nitrogen Generators Work?|url=http://www.peakscientific.com/news/148-how-do-pressure-swing-adsorption-nitrogen-generators-work/|publisher=Peak Scientific|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===

* High nitrogen purity: PSA nitrogen generator plants allow production of high-purity nitrogen from air, which [[Membrane technology|membrane]] systems are unable to provide – up to 99.9995% nitrogen. But in most cases they do not produce more than 98.8% nitrogen with the remainder being argon that is not separated from the nitrogen by the usual PSA process. The argon is not normally a problem, as argon is more inert than nitrogen. This nitrogen purity may also be ensured by cryogenic systems, but they are considerably more complex and justified only by large consumption volumes. The nitrogen generators use CMS (carbon [[molecular sieve]]) technology to produce a continuous supply of ultra high purity nitrogen and are available with internal compressors or without.

* Low operating costs: By substitution of out-of-date air separation plants nitrogen production savings largely exceed 50%.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The net cost of nitrogen produced by nitrogen generators is significantly less than the cost of bottled or liquefied nitrogen.&lt;ref name=mellon&gt;{{cite web|title=MEMO 3 PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF NITROGEN PROCESSES: PSA AND MEMBRANE SYSTEMS|url=http://www.cheme.cmu.edu/course/06302/airsep2/nitro.pdf|publisher=CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY CHEMICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Environmental impact: Generating nitrogen gas is a sustainable, environmentally friendly and energy efficient approach to providing pure, clean, dry nitrogen gas. Compared to the energy needed for a cryogenic air separation plant and the energy needed to transport the liquid nitrogen from the plant to the facility, generated nitrogen consumes less energy and creates far fewer greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name=parker&gt;{{cite web|title=A Sustainable Approach to the Supply of Nitrogen|url=http://www.parkern2.com/_literature_176619/A_Sustainable_Approach_to_the_Supply_of_Nitrogen|publisher=Parker Hannifin, Filtration and Separation Division|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membrane technology ==

[[File:Membrane nitrogen generator.jpg|thumb|Membrane nitrogen generator]]

=== Gas separation concept ===
The operation of [[Artificial membrane|membrane]] systems is based on the principle of differential velocity with which various gas mixture components permeate membrane substance. The driving force in the gas separation process is the difference in partial pressures on different membrane sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Diffusion in and through Polymers |publisher= Hanser Verlag |location= Munich | last1 = Vieth | first1 = W.R. | year = 1991  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membrane cartridge ===

[[File:Flux distribution inside the fiber.jpg|thumb|Flux distribution inside the fiber]]
Structurally, a hollow-fiber membrane represents a cylindrical cartridge functioning as a spool with specifically reeled polymer fibers. Gas flow is supplied under pressure into a bundle of membrane fibers&lt;ref&gt;[https://iscsales.com/compressed-air/nitrogen-generators/membrane-nitrogen-generator/ Product Information "Membrane Nitrogen Generator"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to the difference in partial pressures on the external and internal membrane surface gas flow separation is accomplished.

=== Advantages ===

* Economic benefits: By substitution of out-of-date cryogenic or adsorption systems nitrogen production savings generally exceed 50%.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The net cost of nitrogen produced by nitrogen complexes is significantly less than the cost of cylinder or liquefied nitrogen.&lt;ref name = mellon/&gt;

* Module design: With respect to the simplicity of the system, a nitrogen generator can be split into modules. This is in direct contrast to classical systems where the equipment is designed for a certain stage of the separation process. Using a modular system, the generation facility may be built from a selection of preexisting equipment and where necessary, the output capacity of a plant may be increased at the minimum cost. This option appears all the more useful where a project envisages a subsequent increase in enterprise capacity, or where demand may simply require on site production of nitrogen by employing equipment that is already present.

* Dependability: Gas separation units have no moving component parts, thus ensuring exceptional reliability. Membranes are highly resistant to vibration and shocks, chemically inert to greases, moisture-insensitive, and capable of operating over a wide temperature range of –40°С to +60°С.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} With appropriate maintenance, membrane unit useful life ranges between 130,000 and 180,000 hours (15 to 20 years of continuous operation).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Disadvantages ===
* Limited capacity
* Relatively low purity compared to PSA units (95% purity as compared to 99.9995% - higher purity applications are available at lower flow rates ≤ 10L/min)

== Applications of nitrogen generators ==
* Food and beverage industries: The moment food or beverages are produced, or fruits and vegetables harvested, an aging process kicks in until the complete decay of the products. This is caused by bacteria and other organisms. Generators are used to flood the products with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that displaces the oxygen and prolongs the product lifetime significantly because these organisms cannot develop. Furthermore, chemical degradation of food caused by oxidation can be eliminated or stopped.

* [[Analytical chemistry]]: Nitrogen generators are required for various forms of Analytical chemistry such as [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry]] and [[Gas Chromatography]] where a stable and continuous supply of Nitrogen is necessary.

* [[Aircraft]] &amp; [[motor vehicle]] [[tires]]: Although [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] is 78% Nitrogen, most aircraft tires are filled with nitrogen, and there are many tire and automotive shops with nitrogen generators to fill tires, the advantage being that nitrogen in a tank is dry. Often a compressed air tank will have water in it that comes from atmospheric water vapor condensing in the tank after leaving the air compressor. Nitrogen maintains a more stable pressure when heated and cooled as a result of being dry and doesn't permeate the tyre as easily due to being a slightly larger molecule (155 pm) than O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (152 pm).

* Chemical and petrochemical industries: The primary and very important application of nitrogen in chemical and petrochemical industries is the provision of inert environment aimed at ensuring general industrial safety during cleaning and protection of process vessels. Besides, nitrogen is used for pipelines pressure testing, chemical agents transportation, and regeneration of used catalysts in technological processes.

* Electronics: In electronics, nitrogen serves as an antioxidant in the manufacture of semi-conductors and electric circuits, heat treatment of finished products, as well as in blowing and cleaning.
[[File:Installed nitrogen generator.jpg|thumb|Membrane nitrogen generator providing supervisory gas to dry pipe fire sprinkler system]]

*Fire Protection: The fire protection industry uses nitrogen gas for two different applications - fire suppression and corrosion prevention. Nitrogen generators are used in [[Hypoxic air technology for fire prevention|hypoxic air]] fire prevention systems to produce air with a low oxygen content which will suppress a fire. To prevent corrosion nitrogen generators are used in place of or in conjunction with a compressed air system to provide supervisory nitrogen gas in place of air for dry pipe and pre-action [[Fire sprinkler system|fire sprinkler systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ecscorrosion.com/dry-systems-solutions/|title=Solutions for Dry Pipe Sprinkler Corrosion|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2017-02-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Glass industry: In the glass production, nitrogen proves efficient as a cooling agent for electric arc furnace electrodes, as oxidation inhibitor during process procedures, as well as air cooler.

* [[Metallurgy]]: The metal industry generally utilizes nitrogen as a means of protecting ferrous and non-ferrous metals during annealing. Also, nitrogen is helpful in such standard industry processes as neutral tempering, cementing, hard brazing, stress relieving, cyanide hardening, metal-powder sintering and extrusion die cooling.

* Paint-and-varnish industry: Paint and varnish production uses nitrogen for the creation of an inert environment in process vessels to ensure safety, as well as for oxygen displacement during packing in order to prevent polymerization of drying oils.

* [[Petroleum]] industry: In the petroleum industry, nitrogen is an indispensable component in a number of processes. Most commonly, nitrogen is used to create an inert environment for preventing explosions and for fire safety and to support transportation and transfer of hydrocarbons. Additionally, nitrogen is used for pipeline testing and purging, cleaning technological vessels and cleaning liquefied gas carriers and hydrocarbon storage facilities.

* [[Pharmaceutical industry]]: In the pharmaceutical industry, nitrogen finds application in pharmaceuticals packaging, and ensuring against explosion and fire safety in activities where fine dispersed substances are used.

'''Nooksack Salmon Enhancement Association''' (NSEA) was formed in 1990 as a non-profit organization with an overall goal of seeing an increase in returning natural spawning [[salmon]] to the over 1,600&amp;nbsp;km of rivers and streams in [[Whatcom County, Washington]] in the [[United States]].  The association was formed as part of [[Washington (state)|Washington State's]] Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups Program established by the Washington State Legislature in 1990 to involve local communities, citizen volunteers, and landowners in the state’s salmon recovery efforts.  NSEA is one of 14 groups in Washington State each with the common goal of restoring [[salmonidae|salmonid]] populations and habitat within their region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/about/volunteer/rfeg/ |title=Volunteer Opportunities Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups (RFEG) |publisher=Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife |accessdate=2014-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatcom County is home to the five species of Pacific salmon&lt;ref name=Behnke2002-13&gt;{{cite book |last=Behnke |first=Robert J. |title=Trout and Salmon of North America |publisher=The Free Press|location=New York |isbn=0-7432-2220-2 |year=2002 |page=13 |chapter=Genus Oncorhynchus }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Chinook salmon|chinook]], [[chum salmon|chum]], [[coho]], [[pink salmon|pink]], [[sockeye]] and [[Kokanee salmon|kokanee]], a lake resident sockeye), along with several other [[salmonid]]s ([[bull trout]], [[Dolly Varden trout|Dolly Varden]], both sea-run and resident [[coastal cutthroat trout|coastal cutthroat]], and [[rainbow trout|steelhead and rainbow trout]]) which rely heavily on the return of salmon each year.

The main focus of the NSEA is to restore lowland riparian areas. These areas are commonly impacted by human activities such as [[urban development]], [[agriculture]], and timber harvest. Riparian areas slow runoff, filter chemicals and excess nutrients caused by agriculture, shade the water, and slow the process of erosion to riverbanks. The NSEA deals with the issue of riparian destruction by leading many volunteer projects each year. The aim of these projects are to replant native trees and shrubs along stream banks, construct fences to keep livestock out, do an array of in-stream habitat improvement projects including adding large woody debris or gravel to streams, and stabilize eroding or undercut banks. Along with habitat restoration, the NSEA gives many free educational seminars to the local area, along with local schools, on how they can help with salmon management. The current executive director of NSEA is Rachel Vasak.

The introduction and rapid expansion of [[solar energy|solar technology]] has brought with it a number of occupational hazards for workers responsible for panel installation. These hazards need to be addressed to ensure that workers are protected while we reap the benefits of this technology. Guidelines for safe solar panel installation exist,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA): Solar Construction Safety. (Dec. 2006). Retrieved from http://www.coshnetwork.org/sites/default/files/OSEIA_Solar_Safety_12-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; however the injuries related to panel installation are poorly quantified. There is concern for long term health effects acquired from prolonged ultraviolet radiation and from lifting heavy panels. The lack of data regarding these concerns makes increasing awareness for worker safety more challenging. Below is a discussion of occupational concerns including hazardous exposures to workers, accompanying health effects, the limitations of photovoltaic (PV) panels, challenges associated with this growing industry, as well as current and future directions for policy.

==Exposures and health effects==
With regard to PV occupational safety, there are differing exposures depending on the stage of involvement in solar energy production.  This can be broken down into four stages, including (1) Raw Material Mining and Processing; (2) Construction and Assembling; (3) Installation/Operation; and (4) End of Life Cycle and Recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2015.10.037 |title=Assessment of the safe operation and maintenance of photovoltaic systems |journal=Energy |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=1633–8 |year=2015 |last1=Kamenopoulos |first1=Sotiris N |last2=Tsoutsos |first2=Theocharis }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposures and their impacts on worker health intricately depend on the PV life-cycle stage, as well as depth and duration of system involvement by the individual.  There is a wide variety of tasks required by the PV industry.  These include scientists and engineers for material development, workers who pilot manufacturing facilities, miners and millers, factory manufacturers, power electronics, planners, developers, installation crews who work with electrical grids, transportation jobs, and recycling industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajim.22184 |pmid=23996832 |title=Renewable energy and occupational health and safety research directions: A white paper from the Energy Summit, Denver Colorado, April 11-13, 2011 |journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine |volume=56 |issue=11 |pages=1359–70 |year=2013 |last1=Mulloy |first1=Karen B |last2=Sumner |first2=Steven A |last3=Rose |first3=Cecile |last4=Conway |first4=George A |last5=Reynolds |first5=Stephen J |last6=Davidson |first6=Margaret E |last7=Heidel |first7=Donna S |last8=Layde |first8=Peter M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential hazards are well documented for the first stage, solar PV cell production, and these are mainly chemical in nature. Although not exhaustive, a few of the hazardous materials of notable concern include crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon thin film, cadmium telluride thin film, copper indium selenide, copper indium gallium selenide, and gallium arsenide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Coalition, S. V. T. (2009). Toward a Just and Sustainable Solar Energy Industry. ''San Jose: Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-159X(200001/02)8:1&lt;27::AID-PIP296&gt;3.0.CO;2-8 |title=Photovoltaics: Environmental, health and safety issues and perspectives |journal=Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=27–38 |year=2000 |last1=Fthenakis |first1=V. M |last2=Moskowitz |first2=P. D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary routes for occupational exposure include chemical burns, explosions, and inhalation of gaseous fumes, as a great deal of the materials used in manufacturing are highly toxic and flammable.  Other routes can include hand-to-mouth contact or accidental ingestion.  Most solar cells start as quartz, which is later refined into elemental silicon, thus extraction mines pose a risk to occupational health, including lung disease silicosis amongst miners.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

With respect to crystalline silicon solar cell industrial development, workers may be exposed to hydrofluoric acid, or other acids and alkalis used for cleaning purposes, dopant gases and vapors (POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) due to improper ventilation, or the flammable nature of silane and byproducts from silicon nitride deposition and fabrication of x-Si layers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Other fire-hazard risks arise from the use of extremely flammable SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gas. Exposure to cadmium compounds can be carcinogenic, as Cd is considered a lung carcinogen and is regulated by OSHA.  For a complete list of chemical and material exposures due to photovoltaic production, please reference the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Installation and operation presents a less-studied risk for occupational workers in the PV industry.  Due to the nature of installing solar technology, falls from heights are a significant risk for concern.  Health effects associated with falls from roofs include, but are not limited to: skeletomuscular injuries, brain or spine injuries, concussions, lacerations, bruising, swelling, long-term disability, and/or mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/OHB/FACE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/SolarFallFS.pdf |title=Solar panel installer falls off roof |last=California Department of Public Health Occupational Health Branch, FACE Program|first=|date=|website=Face Facts California fatality Assessment &amp; Control evaluation program|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These can be exacerbated when roofing is old or damaged, or when panels are located close to edges, skylights, and vegetation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01446193.2011.654232 |title=Prevention through design and construction safety management strategies for high performance sustainable building construction |journal=Construction Management and Economics |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=165–77 |year=2012 |last1=Dewlaney |first1=Katie Shawn |last2=Hallowell |first2=Matthew }}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Lack of fall protection, proximity to overhead power lines, and unguarded skylights” can also be contributing factors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  One suggestion to prevent falls includes locating PV panels on the ground whenever possible, or incorporating PV technology into roof membranes, roof shingles, wall panels, or windows.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Aside from falls, there is a risk for electrocution from solar PV installation or nearby power lines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/OHB/FACE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/08CA006.pdf|title=Laborer Dies When He Falls 35 Feet From a Scaffold After Being Electrocuted|last=California Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (CA/FACE) Program|first=|date=January 27, 2009|website=California Department of Public Health|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ergonomic risks from heavy loads or a lack of lifting equipment such as ladder hoists, swing hoists, or truck-mounted cranes.  Cold or heat stress and potential deleterious sun exposure can also occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4415/ANN_16_03_13 |pmid=27698300 |first1=Antonio |title=Towards a greener labour market: Occupational health and safety implications |journal=Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=415–423 |last1=Valenti |first2=Diana |last2=Gagliardi |first3=Grazia |last3=Fortuna |first4=Sergio |last4=Iavicoli |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Installation ultimately combines the exposures of three separate industries into one, including roofing, carpentry, and electrical work, all of which carry high occupational risk.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

 [[File:Solar_Farm_-_panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|280x280px|Solar Farm]]
There may also be a risk for infectious disease spread amongst PV employees. Solar farm (large-scale solar power facility) construction requires soil-disruptive work, which can precipitate exposure to soil-dwelling organisms.  Such cases have been documented in San Luis Obispo County, California between 2011-2014, where 44 workers came down with coccidioidomycosis while constructing 2 solar power-generating facilities.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3201/eid2111.150129 |pmid=26484688 |pmc=4622237 |title=Coccidioidomycosis among Workers Constructing Solar Power Farms, California, USA, 2011–2014 |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1997–2005 |year=2015 |last1=Wilken |first1=Jason A |last2=Sondermeyer |first2=Gail |last3=Shusterman |first3=Dennis |last4=McNary |first4=Jennifer |last5=Vugia |first5=Duc J |last6=McDowell |first6=Ann |last7=Borenstein |first7=Penny |last8=Gilliss |first8=Debra |last9=Ancock |first9=Benedict |last10=Prudhomme |first10=Janice |last11=Gold |first11=Deborah |last12=Windham |first12=Gayle C |last13=Lee |first13=Lauren |last14=Materna |first14=Barbara L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is an infection caused by ''Coccidioides'' fungus spores and causes flu-like symptoms.  However, complications can result, including meningitis, osteomyelitis, or cutaneous lesions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  These can lead to fatality if not treated. In response to these isolated cases, the California Department of Public Health issued numerous recommendations, including improved worksite dust-control measures, equipping earth-moving equipment with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and respiratory protection for workers such as respirators with specialized particulate filters.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

It is important to note that occupational hazards may be exacerbated in settings with fewer worker protection policies in place, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.  If there are lesser or nonexistent standards for acceptable workplace environmental exposures as well as PPE, these chemical hazards could be exceptionally riskier for short and long-term health consequences.  This concept of ‘exporting emissions’ should be of concern, given the propensity for solar panel production to be exported overseas.  Manufacturing has moved from Europe, Japan, and the U.S. to countries such as China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, with nearly half of the world’s photovoltaics made in China as of 2014.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  However, some of the locations that produce the highest numbers of solar panels today may also lack proper worker protections.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

End-of-life recycling is also a large source of hazardous chemical exposures for workers.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John A. |last1=Gambatese |first2=Sathyanarayanan |last2=Rajendran |first3=Michael G. |last3=Behm |date=May 2007 |title=Green Design &amp; Construction Understanding the Effects On Construction Worker Safety And Health |journal=Professional Safety |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=28–35 |url=https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/ASSE-07-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green recycling requires increased material handling and manual separation, which can demand two to three times more individual handing of materials.  This can present a risk for strains, sprains, and punctures.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  PV end-of-life materials can include lead from electronic circuits, as well as brominated flame retardants (BFRs), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) used in circuit boards and solar panel inverters.  These are considered toxic and potential estrogen disrupters, as PBDEs bioaccumulate in fatty tissues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Technology limitations==

The popularity of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels has grown immensely and for good reason. PV panels provide us with the abundant clean energy needed to supply electricity. However, we still fall behind in terms of capturing the free, vast amount of energy produced by nature. The first, most obvious set back comes from the unpredictability of solar energy, i.e. cloudy or rainy weather.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Green, D. (2012, December 19).

While the cost of maintenance and operating are relatively low, solar panels are fragile and easily damaged.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Further, in order to receive continuous supply of electric power the PV panels require inverters and storage batteries which increases costs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Most importantly, in comparison to other renewable energy systems, solar panels efficiency levels are relatively low, ~14%-25%.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The UN Intergovernmental Panel on climate change estimates that the world will need the equivalent of 32,000 terawatt hours (TW h) of electrical energy by 2030.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; PV panels would only meet about 1%-2% of this demand (150-300 TW h).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Although there are limitations to PV solar panels, we can continue to use them in tandem with other forms of renewable energy, such as wind.

==Challenges==

There is no doubt that the use of solar energy has numerous benefits including using sustainable energy and reducing greenhouse gases. However, due to the rapid growth of the photo-voltaic (PV) industry, occupational hazards have increased for workers in the manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of solar energy. The occupational and health aspects of the PV industry have not been thoroughly examined.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2014.07.023 |pmid=25168128 |title=The photovoltaic industry on the path to a sustainable future — Environmental and occupational health issues |journal=Environment International |volume=73 |pages=224–34 |year=2014 |last1=Bakhiyi |first1=Bouchra |last2=Labrèche |first2=France |last3=Zayed |first3=Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few challenges facing workers are exposure to toxic chemicals, electrical shock, and risk of falling from dangerous heights.

During the manufacturing process, workers are exposed to a variety of toxic chemicals. Some of these chemicals such as telluride, cadmium telluride, gallium, and germanium are still under study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other chemicals like chlorosilanes and hydrogen chloride are not only toxic but highly volatile and explosive when mixed with water.&lt;ref&gt;Concerns, H. a. (2010). Retrieved from State Smart Transportation Initiative: https://www.ssti.us/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Health_and_Safety_Concerns_of_Photovoltaic_Solar_Panels_2010_OR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many solar PV technologies use extremely toxic material that have unknown health and environmental consequences including new nano-materials and processes.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, D. A. (2010, January 01). On the Job with Solar PV. Retrieved from Environmental Health Perspectives: https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/118-a19/&lt;/ref&gt; There is limited data on specific air emissions and liquid or solid effluents from PV cells and processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is not only problematic for occupational health but also for environmental health. A risk assessment for these chemicals would address hazard identification, risk of exposure, and an emphasis on dose-response relationships.&lt;ref name=pmid25294341&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-13-78 |pmid=25294341 |pmc=4201727 |title=Opportunities and challenges of nanotechnology in the green economy |journal=Environmental Health |volume=13 |pages=78 |year=2014 |last1=Iavicoli |first1=Ivo |last2=Leso |first2=Veruscka |last3=Ricciardi |first3=Walter |last4=Hodson |first4=Laura L |last5=Hoover |first5=Mark D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of personal protective equipment is another resource that can be utilized to reduce exposures of hazardous chemicals.

The installation phase can also prove to be problematic and pose a serious risk for PV workers. According to “Photo-voltaic Industry on the Path to a Sustainable Future — Environmental and Occupational Health Issues," “The occupational injuries of PV workers have also been the subject of very few publications, although the safety aspect of solar panel installation has been highlighted”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fatal falls from the installation phase have been reported from California and in France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Enforcement of standards, workforce education, and regulation are some ways to prevent falls during the installation of PV panels. The United States Department of Labor’s website https://www.osha.gov/dep/greenjobs/solar.html, lists different resources for preventing and controlling hazards; they promote safe work practices and provide workplace training requirements.

==Policy==

Policies addressing the hazards associated with solar panel manufacturing have the potential to create substantial improvement in worker safety. Research is currently underway exploring the possibility of replacing a number of the more hazardous chemicals workers are exposed to, such as cadmium and hydrofluoric acid, with less toxic chemicals. Once research is complete, enacting a policy that requires companies to make this change could greatly decrease the health risks associated with PV manufacturing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Regarding policies related to solar panel installation, OSHA requires employers to implement and provide safety training for workers, including information on how to assess the worksite for potential hazards, safely perform required action such as heavy lifting, and what to do should an accident occur. Examples of safety equipment include harnesses to protect from falls, covers for panels to protect from burns, and machinery to move the panels to protect from injuries due to heavy lifting.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While companies are required to provide this training and equipment, it is ultimately the responsibility of the worker to carry out measures to protect themselves from injury. The inherent dangers that come with solar panel installation, work that combines the three dangerous professions of roofing, carpentry, and electrical work, are mitigated primarily by the workers’ adherence to correctly using protective equipment and following safety protocol at all times &lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Kathy (July 15, 2015). Solar Energy: Safety Risks and How to Prevent Them. Retrieved from https://www.thehartford.com/resources/renewable-energy/solar-energy-risks&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hierarchy_of_Controls_(By_NIOSH).jpg|thumb|300x300px|Hierarchy of Controls (By NIOSH)]]
This type of protection falls on the very tip of on the hierarchy of controls as the least effective measure to ensure the safety of workers.&lt;ref&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). (2016, July 18) Hierarchy of Controls. Retrieved March 28, 2018, from https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of workers in this field grows, the number of work-related deaths and injuries is likely to grow as well. Policies related specifically to this field are extremely limited; further research is needed on how to best protect workers from potential harm associated with this occupation. In recent years The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health launched the Prevention through Design (PtD) initiative. This initiative strives to improve the health and safety of workers by taking a comprehensive approach to eliminate hazards and control risks earlier in the process. This approach will create the safest work environment by further removing a hazard from the workers or reducing a hazard entirely; electrical safety and construction are already be researched through this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  (2016, July 29) Prevention Through Design. Retrieved March 28, 2018, from https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ptd/&lt;/ref&gt; By using this information and recognizing the unique nature of this occupation, solar panel installation safety can be greatly improved.

Lastly, in 2013, SEIA introduced the Solar Industry Environmental &amp; Social Responsibility Commitment, a voluntary set of guidelines for the solar industry. Companies can choose to sign and agree to adhere to general best practices, including those for worker safety. Although not an official policy to protect those working with solar panel manufacturing and installation, it is a step in the right direction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2014.6882984 |title=Solar's green dilemma |journal=IEEE Spectrum |volume=51 |issue=9 |pages=30–3 |year=2014 |last1=Mulvaney |first1=Dustin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-fire hillslope stabilization treatments''' are treatments aimed at stabilizing fire-affected [[slope]]s by counteracting the negative impact of fire on vegetation and [[soil]] properties. The final objective of these treatments is reducing the [[risk]] of catastrophic [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and [[erosion]] events and protecting valued resources downhill.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robichaud|first1=Peter R.|last2=Ashmun|first2=Louise E.|last3=Sims|first3=Bruce D.|title=Post-fire treatment effectiveness for hillslope stabilization|date=2010|url=http://doi.org/10.2737/RMRS-GTR-240|language=en|doi=10.2737/RMRS-GTR-240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-fire hillslope stabilization treatments are also called post-fire mitigation treatments and emergency stabilization treatments.

Vegetation fires usually partially or totally consume the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]], above-ground organic residue (litter), fine [[root]]s, and [[Soil organic matter|soil organic compounds]], reducing soil protection, enhancing soil water repellency, and compromising soil stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=SHAKESBY|first1=R|last2=DOERR|first2=S|date=February 2006|title=Wildfire as a hydrological and geomorphological agent|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=74|issue=3–4|pages=269–307|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2005.10.006|bibcode=2006ESRv...74..269S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined effect of fire and the occurrence of heavy rainfall in the post-fire season can lead to catastrophic hydrologic and erosion events with severe impacts on population and valued resources downhill such as housing, infrastructures, [[Water supply network|water supply systems]], and critical [[habitat]]s. 

For example, high intensity rainfall after the [[Thomas Fire]] in California (USA) led to catastrophic [[flood]]s and [[debris flow]]s in 2018 with 20 people dead, 300 houses destroyed, and critical [[infrastructure]]s severely affected. Stabilization treatments are part of the [[Burned area emergency response|Burned Area Emergency Response]] (BAER) programme implemented by the US Forest Service and Department of Interior (USA) and similar programmes such as the Rapid Response Assessment Team (RRAT) in Australia conducted in many other fire-prone regions.

== Classification of post-fire hillslope stabilization treatments ==
The design of the hillslope stabilization treatments are aimed at:
* Counteracting the effect of fire on the [[soil protection]] provided by the vegetation and surface cover: treatments such as [[Sowing|seeding]] and [[mulching]] are aimed at reducing runoff and erosion by providing protection to the soil surface. They mimick above ground organic layers that protect the soil against the raindrop impact and absorb rain water, decreasing runoff volume and velocity. 

* Counteracting the effect of fire on specific soil properties involved in the [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and [[erosion]] processes: treatments that seek for offsetting fire effects on soils such as enhanced soil [[water repellency]] ([[surfactant]]s) or decreased soil aggregation ([[flocculant]]s). These products can be applied alone or combined with other stabilization treatments to increase their effectiveness. 

* Reducing slope length: treatments such as the [[erosion barrier]]s are intended to reduce the amount of sediments that reach values-at-risk downhill by reducing the slope length and, thus, runoff velocity and erosion potential. They also create mini-dams that hold the runoff, promote infiltration, and sediments settling.

== Types, selection, and implementation of post-fire treatments ==
The selection of hillslope stabilization treatments should consider three key elements: (i) the effectiveness of the treatment, (iii) the cost of production and transport, and (i) the values-at-risk to be protected &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calkin|first1=David E.|last2=Hyde|first2=Kevin D.|last3=Robichaud|first3=Peter R.|last4=Jones|first4=J. Greg|last5=Ashmun|first5=Louise E.|last6=Dan|first6=Loeffler|title=Assessing post-fire values-at-risk with a new calculation tool|date=2007|url=http://doi.org/10.2737/RMRS-GTR-205|language=en|doi=10.2737/RMRS-GTR-205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most cost-effective treatment might not be adequate to protect critical values-at-risk whereas the treatment with the highest effectiveness and cost could not be suitable to treat large areas if the cost of repairing or replacing values-at-risk is low. Since the highest risk of catastrophic events happens during the first year after the fire, the implementation of any emergency treatment must be conducted quickly after the fire.

* Seeding: Seeds of native or non-native grasses (usually non-reproducing annuals to avoid negative interactions with native flora and alteration of local biodiversity) are manually or aerially applied over the burned area to promote a rapid vegetation establishment that provides ground cover and increase soil stability with their shallow root system. Seeding have been the post-fire hillslope mitigation treatment most frequently used in the world and mainly in the USA (in the 1970s and 1980s 75% of the burned areas treated in the USA were seeded &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robichaud|first1=Peter R.|last2=Rhee|first2=Hakjun|last3=Lewis|first3=Sarah A.|date=2014|title=A synthesis of post-fire Burned Area Reports from 1972 to 2009 for western US Forest Service lands: trends in wildfire characteristics and post-fire stabilisation treatments and expenditures|journal=International Journal of Wildland Fire|volume=23|issue=7|pages=929|doi=10.1071/WF13192}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, negative side-effects such us the potential introduction of non-native species, negative interactions with the recover of native vegetation, and its low efficiency during the first year after the fire before their germination contributed to the reduction of its use (in the 2000s only 30% of the burned areas treated in the USA were seeded &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

* [[Log erosion barrier|Erosion barrier]]s: Contour-felled logs or straw wattles became popular in the USA during the 1990s coinciding with the decrease of seeded areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Felled-logs or straw wattles are placed on the hillslope contour and aim to reduce runoff velocity and create areas where the runoff water can infiltrate, and the sediment settle. Recent studies however, have showed the low effectiveness of this technique for high intensity rainfall, when the holding capacity is easily exceeded, or  their holding capacity is reduced by sediments from previous erosion events. Additionally, a poor design and installation (gaps between the log and the soil surface or not on contour with a slope to one end) can led to increased erosion due to the concentration of the runoff in lowest end of the barrier. Despite these recent insights, log barriers are still extensively applied in Mediterranean countries such as Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864332662|title=Acciones urgentes contra la erosión en áreas forestales quemadas : guía para su planificación en Galicia|date=D.L. 2013|publisher=[Andavira]|others=Vega, José A.|isbn=9788484087168|location=[Santiago de Compostela]|oclc=864332662}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* [[Mulch]]ing: Covering the soil surface with a material that provides protection against raindrop impact, retains water, and reduce runoff velocity. The material most commonly used is agricultural straw, whose application reached in the 2000s 18% of the burned areas treated in the USA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This extensive use is due to its high effectiveness but also the development of its aerial application that reduced the application costs and made it viable in inaccessible areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An alternative to straw mulching is the wood-based mulch using wood chips, wood shreds, and wood strand but also pine needles &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and forest residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prats|first=Sergio A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=Lee H.|last3=Monteiro|first3=Magda|last4=Ferreira|first4=Antonio J.D.|last5=Coelho|first5=Celeste O.A.|last6=Keizer|first6=Jacob J.|title=Effectiveness of forest residue mulching in reducing post-fire runoff and erosion in a pine and a eucalypt plantation in north-central Portugal|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016706112000833|journal=Geoderma|volume=191|pages=115–124|doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.02.009|year=2012|bibcode=2012Geode.191..115P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although marginally used before the 2010s, wood-based mulching is becoming popular since it prevents side-effects of agricultural straw such us the introduction of non-native species and invasive weeds, its longer longevity, and stability to wind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, wood-based mulches can be produced locally from burned or green trees, reducing transport costs.

* Chemical treatments: [[Tackifier]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, and flocculants are used as stand-alone emergency treatments or in combination with other treatment to provide increased soil stability to reduce runoff and erosion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anionic polyacrylamide (PAM), a synthetic petroleum by-product, is a flocculant that is applied as pellets or in solution to the soil surface in fire-affected areas. PAM binds  soil particles, increase soil stability and infiltration, and reduce soil erosion. However, studies on their effectiveness in fire-affected areas are inconclusive or show no significant effect on runoff and erosion &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neris|first1=Jonay|last2=Doerr|first2=Stefan|last3=Notario del Pino|first3=Jesús|last4=Arbelo|first4=Carmen|last5=Rodríguez-Rodríguez|first5=Antonio|date=12 July 2017|title=Effectiveness of Polyacrylamide, Wood Shred Mulch, and Pine Needle Mulch as Post-Fire Hillslope Stabilization Treatments in Two Contrasting Volcanic Soils|journal=Forests|volume=8|issue=7|pages=247|doi=10.3390/F8070247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lado|first1=Marcos|last2=Inbar|first2=Assaf|last3=Sternberg|first3=Marcelo|last4=Ben-Hur|first4=Meni|date=July 2016|title=Effectiveness of Granular Polyacrylamide to Reduce Soil Erosion During Consecutive Rainstorms in a Calcic Regosol Exposed to Different Fire Conditions|journal=Land Degradation &amp; Development|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1453–1462|doi=10.1002/ldr.2448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prats|first1=Sergio Alegre|last2=Martins|first2=Martinho António dos Santos|last3=Malvar|first3=Maruxa Cortizo|last4=Ben-Hur|first4=Meni|last5=Keizer|first5=Jan Jacob|date=January 2014|title=Polyacrylamide application versus forest residue mulching for reducing post-fire runoff and soil erosion|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=468-469|pages=464–474|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.08.066|bibcode=2014ScTEn.468..464P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Combined treatments: Seeding has been frequently combined with fertilizers to increase the viability of the seedlings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seeds have been coated with surfactant to reduce fire-induced soil water repellency and increase water availability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Organic fibres (wood shreds, paper, cotton and flax) have been mixed with seeds, fertilizers and tackifiers to produce hydromulches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although combined treatments can have higher [[effectiveness]], the associated increase in production or transport costs can make their application less cost-effective and only viable to provide additional protection to critical values-at-risk.

'''Potassium carbonate''' ([[potassium|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[carbonate|CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is a white salt, which is [[soluble]] in [[water]] (insoluble in [[ethanol]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231535294|title=Solubility of Potassium Carbonate and Potassium Hydrocarbonate in Methanol|first1=Andrew|last1=Yu.

It can be made as the product of [[potassium hydroxide]]'s absorbent reaction with [[carbon dioxide]]. It is [[Hygroscopy#Deliquescence|deliquescent]], often appearing a damp or wet [[solid]]. Potassium carbonate is used in the production of [[soap]] and [[glass]].

==History==
Potassium carbonate is the primary component of [[potash]] and the more refined '''pearl ash''' or salts of tartar.  Historically, pearl ash was created by baking potash in a [[kiln]] to remove impurities.  The fine, white powder remaining was the pearl ash.  The first [[patent]] issued by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|US Patent Office]] was awarded to [[Samuel Hopkins (inventor)|Samuel Hopkins]]  in 1790 for an improved method of making potash and pearl ash.

In late 18th century [[North America]], before the development of [[baking powder]], pearl ash was used as a [[leavening agent]] in [[quick bread]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See references to "pearl ash" in "American Cookery" by Amelia Simmons, printed by Hudson &amp; Goodwin, Hartford, 1796.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Today, potassium carbonate is prepared commercially by the [[electrolysis]] of [[potassium chloride]].  The resulting [[potassium hydroxide]] is then carbonated using [[carbon dioxide]] to form potassium carbonate, which is often used to produce other {{C|potassium compounds}}.
: 2KOH + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Applications==
* (historically) for [[soap]], [[glass]], and [[dishware|china]] production
* as a mild [[desiccant|drying agent]] where other drying agents, such as [[calcium chloride]] and [[magnesium sulfate]], may be incompatible. It is not suitable for acidic compounds, but can be useful for drying an organic phase if one has a small amount of acidic impurity. It may also be used to dry some ketones, alcohols, and amines prior to distillation.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, J.; Lygo, B.; Procter, G. "Advanced Practical Organic Chemistry" 1998, Stanley Thomas Publishers Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;
* in cuisine, where it has many traditional uses. It is an ingredient in the production of [[grass jelly]], a food consumed in Chinese and Southeast Asian cuisines, as well as Chinese noodles and moon cake. It is used to tenderize [[tripe]]. German [[gingerbread]] recipes often use potassium carbonate as a baking agent, although in combination with [[hartshorn]]. It is however important that the right quantities are used to prevent harm, and cooks should not use it without guidance.
* in the production of cocoa powder to balance the pH (i.e., reduce the acidity) of natural cocoa beans; it also enhances aroma. The process of adding potassium carbonate to cocoa powder is usually called "Dutching" (and the products referred to as Dutch-processed cocoa powder), as the process was first developed in 1828 by [[Coenraad Johannes van Houten|Coenrad Johannes van Houten]], a Dutchman.    
* as a [[buffering agent]] in the production of [[mead]] or [[wine]].
* in antique documents, it is reported to have been used to soften [[hard water]].&lt;ref&gt;Child, Lydia M. "The American Frugal Housewife" 1832&lt;/ref&gt;
* as a fire suppressant in extinguishing deep-fat fryers and various other B class-related fires.
* in [[condensed aerosol fire suppression]], although as the byproduct of potassium nitrate.
* as an ingredient in welding fluxes, and in the flux coating on arc-welding rods.
* as an animal feed ingredient to satisfy the potassium requirements of farmed animals such as broiler breeders.
* as an acidity regulator in Swedish snus

'''Rogue waves''' (also known as '''freak waves''', '''monster waves''', '''episodic waves''', '''killer waves''', '''extreme waves''', and '''abnormal waves''') are large, unexpected and suddenly appearing [[surface wave]]s that can be extremely dangerous, even to large [[ship]]s such as [[ocean liner]]s.&lt;ref name="Econ1"&gt;{{cite news

Rogue waves present considerable danger for several reasons: they are rare, unpredictable, may appear suddenly or without warning, and can impact with tremendous force. A {{convert|12|m|adj=on}} wave in the usual "linear" model would have a breaking pressure of {{convert|6|MT/m2|psi|abbr=~}}. Although modern ships are designed to tolerate a breaking wave of {{convert|15|MT/m2|psi|abbr=on}}, a rogue wave can dwarf both of these figures with a breaking pressure of {{convert|100|MT/m2|psi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="skuld" /&gt;

In [[oceanography]], rogue waves are more precisely defined as waves whose [[wave height|height]] is more than twice the [[significant wave height]] (''H''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; or SWH), which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record. Therefore, rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found on the water; they are, rather, unusually large waves for a given [[sea state]]. Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause, but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave.&lt;ref name="Econ1"/&gt;

Rogue waves can occur in media other than water. They appear to be ubiquitous in nature and have also been reported in liquid [[helium]], in nonlinear optics and in microwave cavities. Recent research has focused on [[optical rogue waves]] which facilitate the study of the phenomenon in the [[laboratory]]. A 2015 paper studied the wave behavior around a rogue wave, including optical, and the Draupner wave, and concluded that "rogue events do not necessarily appear without a warning, but are often preceded by a short phase of relative order".&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.213901 Predictability of Rogue Events], Simon Birkholz, Carsten Brée, Ayhan Demircan, and Günter Steinmeyer, ''Physical Review Letters'' 114, 213901, 28 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;. The physical origin of a rogue wave can be defined by the [[Rogue_wave_theorem#Rogue_Wave_Theorem|rogue wave theorem]].

== Background ==

Rogue waves are an open water phenomenon, in which [[wind]]s, [[water current|currents]], [[non-linear system|non-linear]] phenomena such as [[soliton]]s, and other circumstances cause a wave to briefly form that is far larger than the "average" large occurring wave (the [[significant wave height]] or 'SWH') of that time and place. The basic underlying physics that makes phenomena such as rogue waves possible is that different waves can travel at different speeds, and so they can "pile up" in certain circumstances – known as "[[constructive interference]]". (In deep ocean the speed of a [[gravity wave]] is proportional to the square root of its wavelength—the distance peak-to-peak.) However other situations can also give rise to rogue waves, particularly situations where [[non-linearity|non-linear effects]] or instability effects can cause energy to move between waves and be concentrated in one or very few extremely large waves before returning to "normal" conditions.

Once considered mythical and lacking hard evidence for their existence, rogue waves are now proven to exist and known to be a natural ocean phenomenon. Eyewitness accounts from mariners and damage inflicted on ships have long suggested they occurred. The first scientific evidence of the existence of rogue waves came with the recording of a rogue wave by the Gorm platform in the central [[North Sea]] in 1984. A stand-out wave was detected with a wave height of {{convert|11|m}} in a relatively low sea state.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Soest.hawaii.edu_April_16_2016c"/&gt; However, the wave that caught the attention of the scientific community was the digital measurement of the "[[Draupner wave]]", a rogue wave at the [[Draupner platform]] in the North Sea on January 1, 1995, with a maximum wave height of {{convert|25.6|m}} (peak elevation of {{convert|18.5|m|disp=sqbr}}) . During that event, minor damage was also inflicted on the platform, far above sea level, confirming that the reading was valid.&lt;ref name="haver2003freak"/&gt;

Their existence has also since been confirmed by video and photographs, and [[satellite imagery]] and radar of the ocean surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A rogue wave is a natural ocean phenomenon that is not caused by land movement, only lasts briefly, occurs in a limited location, and most often happens far out at sea.&lt;ref name="Econ1"/&gt; Rogue waves are considered rare but potentially very dangerous, since they can involve the spontaneous formation of massive waves far beyond the usual expectations of [[ship design]]ers, and can overwhelm the usual capabilities of ocean-going vessels which are not designed for such encounters. Rogue waves are therefore distinct from [[tsunami]]s.&lt;ref name="Econ1"/&gt; Tsunamis are caused by massive displacement of water, often resulting from [[earthquake|sudden movement]] of the [[ocean floor]], after which they propagate at high speed over a wide area. They are nearly unnoticeable in deep water and only become dangerous as they approach the shoreline and the ocean floor becomes shallower;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

They are also distinct from [[megatsunami]]s, which are single massive waves caused by sudden impact, such as [[meteor impact]] or [[landslide]]s within enclosed or limited bodies of water. They are also different from the waves described as "[[hundred-year wave]]s", which is a purely [[statistics|statistical]] prediction of the highest wave likely to occur in a hundred-year period in a particular body of water.

Rogue waves have now been proven to be the cause of the sudden loss of some ocean-going vessels. Well documented instances include the freighter [[MS München|MS ''München'']], lost in 1978&lt;ref name="BBCFreak"/&gt; and the [[MV Derbyshire]] lost in 1980, the largest British ship ever lost at sea.&lt;ref name="FaulknerD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FaulknerConference"/&gt; A rogue wave has been implicated in the loss of other vessels including the [[Ocean Ranger]] which was a [[semi-submersible]] mobile [[oil platform|offshore drilling unit]] that sank in Canadian waters on 15 February 1982.&lt;ref name="(Canada)1985"&gt;{{cite book

== History of rogue wave knowledge ==
[[Image:Wea00800,1.jpg|thumb|300px|Merchant ship labouring in heavy seas as a huge wave looms ahead, ca. 1940. Huge waves are common near the 100-[[fathom]] line in the [[Bay of Biscay]].]]

===Mythical waves===

In 1826, French scientist and naval officer Captain [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] reported waves as high as {{convert|33|m|ft|1}} in the Indian Ocean with three colleagues as witnesses, yet he was publicly ridiculed by fellow scientist [[François Arago]]. In that era it was widely held that no wave could exceed {{convert|30|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref name="Parker2012"&gt;{{cite book

In an era when opinions were being expressed that no wave would exceed 30 feet, Dumont d'Urville's estimations were received, it seemed, with some scepticism. No one was more outspoken in his rejection than François Arago, who, calling for a more scientific approach to the estimation of wave height in his instructions for the physical research on the voyage of the Bonité, suggested that imagination played a part in estimations as high as '33 metres' (108 feet). Later, in his 1841 report on the results of the Vénus expedition, Arago made further reference to the 'truly prodigious waves with which the lively imagination of certain navigators delights in covering the seas'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author Susan Casey wrote that much of that disbelief came because there were very few people who had seen a rogue wave, and until the advent of steel double-hulled ships of the 20th century "people who encountered 100-foot rogue waves generally weren't coming back to tell people about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/09/26/the_wave_susan_casey_interview/|title="The Wave": The growing danger of monster waves|author=|date=26 September 2010|website=salon.com|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost 100 years, oceanographers, meteorologists, engineers and ship designers have used a mathematical system commonly called the [[Gaussian function]] (or Gaussian Sea or standard linear model) to predict wave height.&lt;ref name="SoaresSantos2014"&gt;{{cite book

In a storm sea with a significant wave height of {{convert|12|m|ft|1}}, the model suggests there will hardly ever be a wave higher than {{convert|15|m|ft|1}}. One of {{convert|30|m|ft|1}} could indeed happen – but only once in ten thousand years (of wave height of {{convert|12|m|ft|1|disp=sqbr}}). This basic assumption was well accepted (and acknowledged to be an approximation). The use of a Gaussian form to model waves has been the sole basis of virtually every text on that topic for the past 100 years.&lt;ref name="SoaresSantos2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Chl.erdc.usace.army.mil_April_16_2016c"&gt;{{cite web

The first known scientific article on "Freak waves" was written by Professor Laurence Draper in 1964. In that paper which has been described as a 'seminal article' he documented the efforts of the National Institute of Oceanography in the early 1960s to record wave height and the highest wave recorded at that time which was about {{convert|67|ft|m|1}}. Draper also described ''freak wave holes''.&lt;ref name="Draper1"&gt;{{cite journal

===Draupner Wave===

In 1995, strong scientific evidence for the existence of rogue waves came with the recording of what has become known as the [[Draupner wave]]. The [[Draupner platform|Draupner E]] is one structure in a gas pipeline support complex operated by [[Statoil]] about {{convert|100|miles|km|order=flip}}&lt;sup&gt;{{Coord|58|11|19.30|N|2|28|0.00|E|display=inline}}&lt;/sup&gt; offshore and west by southwest from the southern tip of Norway.&lt;ref name="TheWeek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="factpages"&gt;{{cite web|title=Factpages, Norwegian Petroleum Directorate|url=http://factpages.npd.no/FactPages/default.aspx?nav1=licence&amp;nav2=PageView%7cAll&amp;nav3=20884|publisher=Norwegian Petroleum Directorate|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sciencenordic.com"/&gt; The Draupner E platform is the first major oil platform of the jacket-type attached to the seabed with a bucket foundation instead of pilings and a suction anchoring system.&lt;ref name="Sciencenordic.com"/&gt; As a precaution, the operator (Statoil) fitted the platform with an extensive array of instrumentation. The instruments continuously check the platform's movements in particular any movement of the foundations during storm events. The state-of-the-art instrumentation fitted to the platform was able to continuously measure seven key parameters:&lt;ref name="Sciencenordic.com"/&gt;
* wave height, 
* wave slope, 
* wave hold, 
* pressure of the bucket foundations, 
* tension in the platform pillars, and 
* acceleration on deck and foundations.

===Modern knowledge===

Statoil researchers presented a paper in 2000 which collated evidence that freak waves were not the rare realizations of a typical or slightly non-gaussian sea surface population (''Classical'' extreme waves) but rather they were the typical realizations of a rare and strongly non-gaussian sea surface population of waves (''Freak'' extreme waves).&lt;ref name="2000_ISOPE_Conference"&gt;{{cite conference

In 2000 the British oceanographic vessel [[RRS Discovery (1962)|RRS ''Discovery'']] recorded a {{convert|29|m|adj=on}} wave off the coast of Scotland near [[Rockall]]. This was a scientific research vessel and was fitted with high quality instruments. The subsequent analysis determined that under severe gale force conditions with wind speeds averaging {{convert|21|m/s|ft/s|1}} a ship-borne wave recorder measured individual waves up to {{convert|29.1|m|ft|1}} from crest to trough, and a maximum significant wave height of {{convert|18.5|m|ft|1}}. These were some of the largest waves recorded by scientific instruments up to that time. The authors noted that modern wave prediction models are "known" to significantly under-predict extreme sea states for waves with a 'significant' height (H&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) above {{convert|12|m|ft|1}}. The analysis of this event took a number of years, and noted that "none of the state-of-the-art weather forecasts and wave models—the information upon which all ships, oil rigs, fisheries, and passenger boats rely—had predicted these behemoths." Put simply, a scientific model (and also ship design method) to describe the waves encountered did not exist. This finding was widely reported in the press which reported that "according to all of the theoretical models at the time under this particular set of weather conditions waves of this size should not have existed".&lt;ref name="Econ1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheWeek"&gt;{{cite web

Under severe gale force conditions with wind speeds averaging 21 ms1 a shipborne wave recorder measured individual waves up to 29.1 m from crest to trough, and a maximum significant wave height of 18.5 m. The fully formed sea developed in unusual conditions as westerly winds blew across the North Atlantic for two days, during which time a frontal system propagated at a speed close to the group velocity of the peak waves. The measurements are compared to a wave hindcast which successfully simulated the arrival of the wave group but underestimated the most extreme waves.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | quote      = The area of the Central North Sea is notorious for the occurrence of very high waves in certain wave trains. The short-term distribution of these wave trains includes waves which are far steeper than predicted by the Rayleigh distribution. Such waves are often termed “extreme waves” or “freak waves.” An analysis of the extreme statistical properties of these waves has been made. The analysis is based on more than 12 yr of wave records from the Mærsk Olie og Gas AS operated Gorm Field which is located in the Danish sector of the Central North Sea. From the wave recordings more than 400 freak wave candidates were found. The ratio between the extreme crest height and the significant wave height (20-min value) has been found to be about 1.8, and the ratio between extreme crest height and extreme wave height has been found to be 0.69. The latter ratio is clearly outside the range of Gaussian waves, and it is higher than the maximum value for steep nonlinear long-crested waves, thus indicating that freak waves are not of a permanent form, and probably of short-crested nature. The extreme statistical distribution is represented by a Weibull distribution with an upper bound, where the upper bound is the value for a depth-limited breaking wave. Based on the measured data, a procedure for determining the freak wave crest height with a given return period is proposed. A sensitivity analysis of the extreme value of the crest height is also made. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research confirms that observed wave height distribution in general follows well the [[Rayleigh distribution]], but in shallow waters during high energy events, extremely high waves are more rare than this particular model predicts.&lt;ref name="Laird1" /&gt;

Rogue waves may also occur in [[lake]]s. A phenomenon known as the "Three Sisters" is said to occur in [[Lake Superior]] when a series of three large waves forms. The second wave hits the ship's deck before the first wave clears. The third incoming wave adds to the two accumulated backwashes and suddenly overloads the ship deck with tons of water. The phenomenon is one of various theories as to the cause of the sinking of the [[SS Edmund Fitzgerald]] on Lake Superior in November 1975.&lt;ref name="Wolff"&gt;Wolff, Julius F. (1979).

Serious studies of the phenomenon of rogue waves only started about 20–30 years ago and have intensified since about 2005. One of the remarkable features of the rogue waves is that they always appear from nowhere and quickly disappear without a trace. Recent research has suggested that there could also be 'super-rogue waves' which are up to five times the average sea-state. Rogue waves has now become a near universal term given by scientists to describe isolated large amplitude waves, that occur more frequently than expected for normal, Gaussian distributed, statistical events. Rogue waves appear to be ubiquitous in nature and are not limited to the oceans. They appear in other contexts and have recently been reported in liquid helium, in nonlinear optics and in microwave cavities. It is now universally accepted by marine researchers that these waves belong to a specific kind of sea wave, not taken into account by conventional models for sea wind waves.&lt;ref name="2008AnnualReview"&gt;{{cite journal

Researchers at the [[Australian National University]] have also recently (2012) proven the existence of ''rogue wave holes'', an inverted profile of a rogue wave. In maritime folk-lore, stories of rogue holes are as common as stories of rogue waves. They follow from theoretical analysis but had never been proven experimentally. In 2012 the ANU published research confirming the existence of rogue wave holes on the water surface observed in a water wave tank.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Onlinelibrary.wiley.com_April_16_2016c"&gt;{{cite journal

There are a number of research programmes currently underway focussed on rogue waves including:

* In the course of Project MaxWave, researchers from the GKSS Research Centre, using data collected by [[ESA]] [[satellite]]s, identified a large number of radar signatures that have been portrayed as evidence for rogue waves. Further research is under way to develop better methods of translating the radar echoes into sea surface elevation, but at present this technique is not proven.&lt;ref name = 'SEASAR 2006'&gt;{{cite web

* [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Research in this field is ongoing. Two researchers at the  [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] partially supported by the Naval Engineering Education Consortium (NEEC) have considered the problem of short-term prediction of rare, extreme water waves and have developed and published their research on an effective predictive tool of about 25 wave periods. This tool can give ships and their crews a two-to-three minute warning of potentially catastrophic impact allowing crew some time to shut down essential operations on a ship (or offshore platform).

Because the phenomenon of rogue waves is still a matter of active research, it is premature to state clearly what the most common causes are or whether they vary from place to place. The areas of highest predictable risk appear to be where a strong [[ocean current|current]] runs counter to the primary direction of travel of the waves; the area near [[Cape Agulhas]] off the southern tip of Africa is one such area; the warm [[Agulhas Current]] runs to the southwest, while the dominant winds are [[westerlies]]. However, since this thesis does not explain the existence of all waves that have been detected, several different mechanisms are likely, with localised variation. Suggested mechanisms for freak waves include the following:

;[[Diffraction|Diffractive]] [[Focus (geometry)|focus]]ing :According to this hypothesis, coast shape or seabed shape directs several small waves to meet in phase. Their crest heights combine to create a freak wave.&lt;ref name="OPC"&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = May 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Focusing by currents :Waves from one current are driven into an opposing current. This results in shortening of wavelength, causing shoaling (i.e., increase in wave height), and oncoming wave trains to compress together into a rogue wave.&lt;ref name="OPC"/&gt; This happens off the South African coast, where the [[Agulhas Current]] is countered by [[westerlies]].&lt;ref name="Iopscience.iop.org_April_17_2016c"/&gt;

;[[Nonlinear]] effects ([[modulational instability]]) :It seems possible to have a rogue wave occur by natural, nonlinear processes from a random background of smaller waves.&lt;ref name="BBCFreak"/&gt; In such a case, it is hypothesised, an unusual, unstable wave type may form which 'sucks' energy from other waves, growing to a near-vertical monster itself, before becoming too unstable and collapsing shortly after. One simple model for this is a wave equation known as the [[nonlinear Schrödinger equation]] (NLS), in which a normal and perfectly accountable (by the standard linear model) wave begins to 'soak' energy from the waves immediately fore and aft, reducing them to minor ripples compared to other waves. The NLS can be used in deep water conditions. In shallow water, waves are described by the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]] or the [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq equation]]. These equations also have non-linear contributions and show solitary-wave solutions. A small-scale rogue wave consistent with the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (the Peregrine Solution) was produced in a laboratory water tank in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Constructive interference of elementary waves'''

Rogue waves can result from the constructive interference (dispersive and directional focusing) of elementary 3D waves enhanced by nonlinear effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fedele |first=Francesco |last2=Brennan |first2=Joseph |last3=Ponce de León |first3=Sonia |last4=Dudley |first4=John |last5=Dias |first5=Frédéric |date=2016-06-21 |title=Real world ocean rogue waves explained without the modulational instability |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep27715 |journal=Scientific Reports |language=en |volume=6 |pages=27715 |doi=10.1038/srep27715 |issn=2045-2322 |pmc=4914928 |pmid=27323897|bibcode=2016NatSR...627715F }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Wind wave]] interactions :While it is unlikely that wind alone can generate a rogue wave, its effect combined with other mechanisms may provide a fuller explanation of freak wave phenomena. As wind blows over the ocean, energy is transferred to the sea surface. When strong winds from a storm happen to blow in the opposing direction of the ocean current the forces might be strong enough to randomly generate rogue waves. Theories of instability mechanisms for the generation and growth of wind waves—although not on the causes of rogue waves—are provided by Phillips&lt;ref name="JFM"&gt;Phillips 1957, ''[[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and Miles.&lt;ref name="Iopscience.iop.org_April_17_2016c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JFM2"&gt;Miles, 1957, ''[[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Thermal expansion]] :When a stable wave group in a warm water column moves into a cold water column the size of the waves must change because energy must be conserved in the system. So each wave in the wave group become smaller because cold water holds more wave energy based on density. The waves are now spaced farther apart and because of gravity they will propagate into more waves to fill up the space and become a stable wave group. If a stable wave group exists in cold water and moves into a warm water column the waves will get larger and the wavelength will be shorter. The waves will seek equilibrium by attempting to displace the waves amplitude because of gravity. However, by starting with a stable wave group the wave energy can displace toward the center of the group. If both the front and back of the wave group are displacing energy toward the center it can become a rogue wave. This would happen only if the wave group is very large.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The spatio-temporal focusing seen in the NLS equation can also occur when the nonlinearity is removed. In this case, focusing is primarily due to different waves coming into phase, rather than any energy transfer processes. Further analysis of rogue waves using a fully nonlinear model by R.H. Gibbs (2005) brings this mode into question, as it is shown that a typical wavegroup focuses in such a way as to produce a significant wall of water, at the cost of a reduced height.

A rogue wave, and the deep trough commonly seen before and after it, may last only for some minutes before either breaking, or reducing in size again. Apart from one single rogue wave, the rogue wave may be part of a wave packet consisting of a few rogue waves. Such rogue [[wave group]]s have been observed in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifremer.fr/web-com/stw2004/rw Frederic-Moreau. The Glorious Three], translated by M. Olagnon and G.A. Chase / Rogue Waves-2004, Brest, France&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific applications==
The possibility of the artificial stimulation of rogue wave phenomena has attracted research funding from [[DARPA]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. [[Bahram Jalali]] and other researchers at [[UCLA]] studied microstructured [[optical fiber]]s near the threshold of [[soliton]] [[supercontinuum]] generation and observed rogue wave phenomena. After modelling the effect, the researchers announced that they had successfully characterized the proper initial conditions for generating rogue waves in any medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Reported encounters ==
{{Main|List of rogue waves}}
It should be noted that many of these encounters are only reported in the media, and are not examples of open ocean rogue waves. Often, in popular culture, an endangering huge wave is loosely denoted as a ''rogue wave'', while it has not been (and most often cannot be) established that the reported event is a rogue wave in the scientific sense — ''i.e.'' of a very different nature in characteristics as the surrounding waves in that [[sea state]] and with very low probability of occurrence (according to a [[Gaussian process]] description as valid for [[linear wave theory]]).

This section lists a limited selection of notable incidents.

==Quantifying the impact of rogue waves on ships==

The loss of the [[MS München]] in 1978 provided some of the first physical evidence of the existence of rogue waves. The MS München was a state-of-the-art cargo ship with multiple water-tight compartments, an expert crew and was considered unsinkable. She was lost with all crew and the wreck has never been found. The only evidence found was the starboard lifeboat which was recovered from floating wreckage some time later. The lifeboats hung from forward and aft blocks {{convert|20|m|ft}} above the waterline. The pins had been bent back from forward to aft, indicating the lifeboat hanging below it had been struck by a wave that had run from fore to aft of the ship which had torn the lifeboat from the ship. To exert such force the wave must have been considerably higher than {{convert|20|m|ft}}. At the time of the inquiry, the existence of rogue waves was considered so statistically unlikely as to be near impossible. Consequently, the Maritime Court investigation concluded that the severe weather had somehow created an 'unusual event' that had led to the sinking of the München.&lt;ref name="BBCFreak"&gt;{{cite web

The 1980 loss of the [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] during Typhoon Orchid south of Japan with the loss of all crew marked a turning point for ship design. The ''Derbyshire'' was an ore-bulk-oil combination carrier built in 1976. At 91,655 gross register tons, she was—and remains—the largest British ship ever to have been lost at sea. The wreck was found in June 1994. The survey team deployed a remotely operated vehicle to photograph the wreck. A private report was published in 1998 which prompted the British government to reopen a formal investigation into the sinking. The British government investigation included a comprehensive survey by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] which took 135,774 pictures of the wreck during two surveys. The formal forensic investigation concluded that the ship sank because of structural failure and absolved the crew of any responsibility. Most notably, the report determined the detailed sequence of events that led to the structural failure of the vessel. A third comprehensive analysis was subsequently done by Douglas Faulkner, professor of marine architecture and ocean engineering at the [[University of Glasgow]]. His highly analytical and scientific report published in 2001 examined and linked the loss of the MV ''Derbyshire'' with what he called the emerging body of scientific evidence regarding the mechanics of freak waves. Professor Faulkner concluded that it was almost certain that ''Derbyshire'' would have encountered a wave of sufficient size to destroy her. Faulkner's conclusions have not been refuted in the more than 15 years since they were first presented (as of 2016). Indeed, subsequent analysis by others has corroborated his findings. Faulkner's finding that the ''Derbyshire'' was lost because of a rogue wave has had widespread implications on ship design.&lt;ref name="FaulknerD"/&gt; Faulkner has subsequently proposed the need for a paradigm shift in thinking for the design of ships and offshore installations to include what he calls a Survival Design approach additional to current design requirements. There is however no evidence that his recommendations have yet been adopted (as of 2016).&lt;ref name="FaulknerConference"&gt;{{cite conference

This report describes the navigation systems and methodologies used to precisely position the vessel and vehicles. Precise navigation permits the survey team to control the path of the subsea vehicle in order to execute the survey plan, provides the ability to return to specific targets, and allows the assessment team to correlate observations made at different times from different vehicles. In this report, we summarize the techniques used to locate Argo as well as the repeatability of those navigation fixes. To determine repeatability, we selected a number of instances where the vehicle lines crossed. By registering two images from overlapping areas on different tracklines, we can determine the true position offset. By comparing the position offset derived from the images to the offsets obtained from navigation, we can determine the navigation error. The average error for 123 points across a single tie line was 3.1 meters, the average error for a more scattered selection of 18 points was 1.9 meters.

In 2004 an extreme wave was recorded impacting the Admiralty Breakwater, [[Alderney]] in the Channel Islands. This breakwater is exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. The peak pressure recorded by a shore-mounted transducer was 745 kPa which corresponds to a pressure of 74.5 tonnes/m2 or 74.5 Mt/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre). This pressure far exceeds almost any design criteria for modern ships and this wave would have destroyed almost any merchant vessel.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Soest.hawaii.edu_April_16_2016c"&gt;{{cite web

More recent work by Smith in 2007 confirmed prior forensic work by Faulkner in 1998 and determined that the MV ''Derbyshire'' was exposed to a hydrostatic pressure of a ''static head'' of water of about {{convert|20|m|ft}} with a resultant static pressure of 201&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A failure load pressure of 201 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as 20,500 kgf/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 20.5 Mt/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre).&lt;/ref&gt; This is in effect 20 metres of green water (possibly a ''super rogue wave'')&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Note that the term ''super rogue wave'' had not yet been coined by ANU researchers at that time.&lt;/ref&gt; flowing over the vessel. The deck cargo hatches on the ''Derbyshire'' were determined to be the key point of failure when the rogue wave washed over the ship. The design of the hatches only allowed for a static pressure of less than two metres of water or 17.1&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A design load pressure (of the hatches) of 17.1 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as 1,744 kgf/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 1.7 Mt/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre).&lt;/ref&gt; in other words the typhoon load on the hatches was more than ten (10) times the design load. The forensic structural analysis of the wreck of the ''Derbyshire'' is now widely regarded as irrefutable.&lt;ref name="SmithConference"/&gt;

In addition fast moving waves are now known to ''also'' exert extremely high dynamic pressure. It is known that plunging or breaking waves can cause short-lived impulse pressure spikes called Gifle peaks. These can reach pressures of 200&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (or more) for milliseconds which is sufficient pressure to lead to brittle fracture of mild steel. Evidence of failure by this mechanism was also found on the ''Derbyshire''.&lt;ref name="FaulknerD"&gt;{{cite book

==Ship failure mechanism==

Very few ship-wrecks have ever been fully investigated. The most recent bulk-carrier loss on the open seas to have been subjected to thorough investigation (as at March 2011) was the UK-owned M.V. ''Derbyshire'', which sank in 1980. Its entire crew of forty-four, all British citizens, perished. It took 14 years of pressure from the British public and a privately funded expedition to locate the wreck before a formal remote-camera search and investigation was done by the British government. At least a couple of hundred bulk carriers have been lost since 1980 and none have been properly investigated.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} A survey of 125 bulk carriers that sank between 1963 and 1996 found that seventy-six ''probably'' flooded, another four because of hatch-cover failure, the rest from ''unidentified'' causes. Nine other vessels broke completely in two. Causes of the remaining forty losses are unknown.&lt;ref name="Coldtype.net_April_17_2016c"&gt;{{cite web

The scenario is very simple: the weight of the ship accelerates her down the back slope of the previous wave, the bow sticks into the lower part of the front of the giant incoming wave, and thousands of tons of green water fall onto the fore part of the ship. What happens next depends on the structure of the vessel.&lt;ref name="PowerBoating"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor Faulkner who did the forensic independent analysis of the loss of the M.V. ''Derbyshire'' explains why this is such a problem for bulk carriers. He states that "It is quite possible that some of the many unexplained heavy weather losses (of bulk carriers) may have been caused by hatch cover or coaming failures because fore end plunging due to flooding of large holds can be rapid." He noted in his report that "because of their high inertias and natural pitch periods, these large ships do not rise to the waves, as appropriately experienced masters have confirmed. They tend to bury into them." Faulkner concluded that "beyond any reasonable doubt, the direct cause of the loss of the M.V. ''Derbyshire'' was the quite inadequate strength of her cargo hatch covers to withstand the forces of Typhoon Orchid." He also noted that "It is not possible to say which of the eighteen covers failed first, or from which direction the waves came; but evidence and other arguments suggest that the no. 1 hatch covers were probably the first to yield, probably from waves over the bow with the ship hove-to."&lt;ref name="FaulknerD"/&gt;

==Design standards==

In November 1997 the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) adopted  new rules covering survivability and structural requirements for bulk carriers of {{convert|150|m|ft|1}} and upwards. The bulkhead and double bottom must be strong enough to allow the ship to survive flooding in hold one unless loading is restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is now widely held that rogue waves present considerable danger for several reasons: they are rare, unpredictable, may appear suddenly or without warning, and can impact with tremendous force. A {{convert|12|m|adj=on}} wave in the usual "linear" model would have a breaking force of {{convert|6|MT/m2|psi|abbr=~}}. Although modern ships are designed to (typically) tolerate a breaking wave of 15 MT/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a rogue wave can dwarf both of these figures with a breaking force far exceeding 100 MT/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="skuld" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Note that MT/m refers to metric tonnes per square metre.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has presented calculations using the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Common Structural Rules (CSR) for a typical bulk carrier which are consistent.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Smith has presented calculations for a hypothetical bulk carrier with a length of 275m and a displacement of 161,000 metric tonnes, the design Hydrostatic pressure, 8.75 m below waterline is 88 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 88 kPa or 8.9 MT/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre). For the same carrier the design Hydrodynamic pressure is 122 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 122 kPa or 12,440 kgf/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (kilograms of force per square metre) or 12.44 Mt/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithConference"/&gt;

Peter Challenor, a leading scientists in this field from the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom was quoted in Casey's book in 2010 that "We don’t have that random messy theory for nonlinear waves. At all", he says. "People have been working actively on this for the past 50 years at least. We don’t even have the start of a theory".&lt;ref name="TheWeek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt;

In 2006 Smith proposed that the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) recommendation 34 pertaining to standard wave data be modified so that the minimum design wave height be increased to {{convert|65|ft|m|1}}. He presented analysis that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} high waves can be experienced in the 25-year lifetime of oceangoing vessels, and that {{convert|98|ft|m|1}} high waves are less likely, but not out of the question. Therefore, a design criterion based on {{convert|36|ft|m|1}} high waves seems inadequate when the risk of losing crew and cargo is considered. Smith has also proposed that the dynamic force of wave impacts should be included in the structural analysis.&lt;ref name="SmithBook"&gt;{{cite book  | last      =  Smith

It is notable that the Norwegian offshore standards now take into account extreme severe wave conditions and require that a 10,000-year wave does not endanger the ships integrity.&lt;ref name="rosenthal"/&gt; Rosenthal notes that as at 2005 rogue waves were not explicitly accounted for in Classification Societies’ Rules for ships’ design.&lt;ref name="rosenthal"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Navy historically took the design position that the largest wave likely to be encountered was 21.4&amp;nbsp;m (70&amp;nbsp;ft). Smith observed in 2007 that the navy now believes that larger waves can occur and the possibility of extreme waves that are steeper (i.e. do not have longer wavelengths) is now recognized. The navy has not had to make any fundamental changes in ship design as a consequence of new knowledge of waves greater than 21.4&amp;nbsp;m (70&amp;nbsp;ft) because they build to higher standards.&lt;ref name="SmithConference"/&gt;

A characteristic of the shipping industry is that there are no uniform codes or international standards. There are more than 50 classification societies worldwide, each has different rules. Ship design has historically largely been led by the ship insurers who inspected, classified and insured vessels. Hence the widespread adoption of new rules to allow for the existence of rogue waves is likely to take many years.&lt;ref name="SmithConference"/&gt;

Kala Sagar (Hindi word which means Ocean of Art) is the unique government museum where world’s largest collection of art created purely from damaged, discarded or waste sanitary ware items is exhibited. The whole collection of art pieces are created by only one artist Mr. Vijay Pal Goel (Age 50 years) who is creating this unique art since 1994 and is a non government employee.KALA SAGAR is situated in the sector 36-D, Chandigarh UT, INDIA.

The main objective of the artist behind this unique art is to generate mass awareness for reuse of waste materials for environment protection, treatment of the special children and established a tourist place for the special people such as mentally challenged people, visually impaired and physically handicapped.

This art is created by Mr. Vijay Pal Goel (Age 50 years). He was a private sanitary contractor. In the year 1994, an idea struck his mind and He started collecting waste sanitary material and converted it into marvelous art pieces. He is an uneducated person. He also never learned art making from any school, college or from any teacher.

[[File:Kalasagar 1.jpg|thumb|alt=AIRPLANE|Airplane Created Purely From Sanitary Waste]]
The distinctiveness of the art is that whole collection of art pieces are shaped and created only from sanitary waste item. The sanitary waste items means discarded and damaged sanitary products used in bathroom, kitchen and public health such as water storage tanks, pipes, tapes, fountains, chinaware etc.

All the art pieces are created without using melting, molding, cementation, and carving techniques. This feature of the art makes it different from all other kind of art forms in the world.

The art pieces are created by arranging and assembling the different sanitary waste pieces and giving it a desired shape. For example: Airplanes, train, animal figures, telephones, human statues etc.

The size of the art pieces varies from 0.5&amp;nbsp;inch to 20 feet and depends upon of availability of the waste material. Presently the numbers of art pieces are around 300.

The other important fact of this art is that, this is the first kind of art form which is completely eco-friendly. Nothing gets wasted in teaching and creating this form of art. Here “nothing” means nothing. Every thing used in this art is only waste and discarded material. The same components of one art pieces can be easily converted into other and then again dismantled into the components.

==Art therapy==
The artist Mr. Vijay Pal Goel and his wife Mrs. Madhu Goel performed a study on the special children of the Government Institute for Mentally Retarded Children and 7 other special schools in the Chandigarh, INDIA.

The study covers around 500 Mentally Retarded Children for a time period 2001-2002. During this period these children were taught this unique art form.

The result of this study was very amazing. There is a noticeable change in the children behaviors. They became calmer and focused with enhancement in creativity skill and physical strength.

In year 2002, The Department of Social Welfare, Chandigarh Administration also appointed the Mr. Goel as full-time consultant for the rehabilitation of persons with disabilities on a very meager honorarium.

They also conducted a similar workshop in the Govt. Institute for Blind, Sector 26, Chandigarh.

Now it is not very astounding to say that, this is the only art technique which can be enjoyed and also created by the Mentally Retarded and visually impaired children and Kala Sagar is the first museum for these special children.

Mr. and Mrs. Goel were also certified and awarded by the several govt. and other agencies for their innovative therapy and contribution in this field.

But without any funding and monetary support Mr. and Mrs. Goel were unable to continue their art therapy.

==Pulse Polio Awareness==
In the year 2000, the Health Minister, Punjab, INDIA impressed by the innovative art, requested the artist to construct a tableau on Pulse Polio for mass Awareness and the tableau was roamed in all the 17 districts covering almost all the cities and town and the remote areas of the Punjab. A large number of children were also vaccinated during this campaign.

==Awards and recognition==
The artist was honoured by The Governor of Punjab with the prestigious State Award on the Indian Independence Day (15 August 1998) for his tremendous contribution and excellent work in the field of art.

On 4th, September 1998, the Chandigarh administration  persuaded the artist to donate whole his art collection to the government for the purpose of tourism promotion and a permanent exhibition of the art pieces was exhibited at the government museum Kala Sagar started in sector 36-D, Chandigarh UT. This museum is specially established only for the display of the unique art.

The Director, Government Institute for Mentally Retarded Children, Chandigarh honored him for his art therapy program.

The Director, Department of Environment, Chandigarh Administration also honored the artist for his unique way of waste management.

The Director, Department of Social Welfare, Chandigarh Administration UT honored him for his art therapy program.

The President, Parent Association of Mentally Retarded Children honored him for his art therapy program.

The artist is also certified by the several other prestigious awards (such as Rotary Club Midtown, etc.) for his tremendous social work.

==Background==
The universe may be accelerating, fueled perhaps by a cosmological constant or some
other field possessing long range ‘repulsive’ effects. A model must predict the correct form for
the large scale clustering spectrum,&lt;ref name=cluster&gt;Galaxies are not scattered about the universe in a random way, but rather form an intricate network of filaments, sheets, and clusters. How these large-scale structures formed is at the root of many key questions in cosmology.&lt;/ref&gt; account for [[cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background]] anisotropies on large and intermediate angular scales, and provide agreement with the [[Distance measures (cosmology)|luminosity distance relation]] obtained from observations of high [[redshift]] [[supernova]]e. The modeled evolution of the universe includes a large amount of unknown matter in order to agree with such observations. This matter has two components [[cold dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. Each contributes to the theory of the origination of galaxies and the expansion of the universe. The universe must have a critical density, a density not explained by  [[baryonic matter]] (ordinary [[matter]]) alone.

==Scalar field==
The dark matter can be modeled as a scalar field using two fitted parameters, mass and [[reflexivity (social theory)|self-interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldeschi|first=M.

'''Seyed Hossein Mousavian''' (born 1957 in [[Kashan, Iran|Kashan]]) is an Iranian policymaker and scholar who served on Iran's nuclear diplomacy team in negotiations with the EU and [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. He currently resides in the [[United States]], where he is a visiting research scholar at [[Princeton University]].

==Early life and education==

Mousavian was born in 1957 to a prosperous carpet-dealing family in Kashan, a major carpet-manufacturing center. His family had close ties to the [[Motalefeh]], a religiously oriented revolutionary movement that dated back to the early 1960s and was eventually absorbed into the [[Islamic Republican Party]] (IRP).&lt;ref name="weekly standard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerecht|first=Reuel|title=Princeton's Iranian Agent of Influence|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/princeton-s-iranian-agent-influence_651372.html|publisher=The Weekly Standard|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousavian studied at the [[Iran University of Science and Technology]], as well as [[Sacramento City College]] and [[Sacramento State University]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=carnegie&gt;{{cite web|title=Seyed Hossein Mousavian|url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/people/data/seyed_hossein_mousavian.html|publisher=Carnegie Council|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering from [[Sacramento State University]] of California. He was awarded an MA in International Relations from the University of Tehran in 1998 and a PhD in the same subject from the University of Kent at Canterbury in 2002.

==Early career in Iran==

It has been speculated that Mousavian's father's connections in Motalefeh helped him win access to leading IRP figures, as a consequence of which he was named editor-in-chief of the ''[[Tehran Times]]'', the revolution's English-language newspaper, which was established by IRP founder [[Mohammad Hosseini Beheshti]].&lt;ref name="weekly standard" /&gt; During his editorial tenure, from 1980 to 1990, Mousavian authored more than 2,000 articles. He also held a number of positions in the Iranian government in the 1980s, including a stint as Vice President of the Islamic Propagation Organization (1981–1983), worked with future-President [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] as Chairman of the Parliament Administration Organization (1983–1986), and was Head and then Director General of the West Europe department of the Foreign Ministry (1986–1989).&lt;ref name=carnegie /&gt; During the 1980s, Mousavian played a major role in what he later described, in a 2012 book, as “Iran's humanitarian intervention to secure the release of Western hostages in Lebanon.” However, the hostage-takers (Hezbollah), had acted on instructions from the government in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmari|first=Sohrab|title=Chronic Antagonist|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304022004577514852558385294|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambassador to Germany==

Mousavian was Iran's Ambassador to [[Germany]] from 1990 to 1997.&lt;ref name=carnegie /&gt; Four Iranian dissidents were murdered at Berlin's Mykonos restaurant in 1992, and five years later a German court concluded that Iran's Special Affairs Committee had ordered the murders, and that the supreme leader, president, foreign minister and intelligence minister of Iran were all active members of that committee. The court found an Iranian intelligence officer and three Lebanese men guilty and issued an arrest warrant for Iran's intelligence minister. Also, Germany expelled four Iranian diplomats and asked that Mousavian be recalled to Iran; he did return to Tehran shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=iranhrdc&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder at Mykonos: Anatomy of a Political Assassination|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/english/publications/reports/3150-murder-at-mykonos-anatomy-of-a-political-assassination.html?p=1#.UTNiSTDqjoI |publisher=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the issuance of the arrest warrant for the intelligence minister, which Mousavian described as an insult to the entire population of Iran,&lt;ref name=pdmi&gt;{{cite web|last=Irandoost|first=Arash|title=From Tehran to Princeton|url=http://pdmi.org/2011/12/from-tehran-to-princeton/|publisher=Pro Democracy Movement of Iran|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian news agencies made veiled threats against Germans abroad. Mousavian echoed, saying that if European nations kept treating Iran as America and Israel did, then they would be treated the same way by Iran.&lt;ref name=iranhrdc /&gt;

It was also during Mousavian's ambassadorial tenure that the Salman Rushdie affair took place, and Mousavian went on German radio to announce that Iran would not lift its fatwa against the writer.&lt;ref name=lexis&gt;{{cite web|title=Rushdie sentence won't affect Iran-German trade, says envoy|url=http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=3c95f50665f079733f67322481f5d9a6&amp;docnum=247&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=201&amp;wchp=dGLzVzt-zSkAA&amp;_md5=6216a1cac0aeef310e0d75560abf56c7|publisher=Arab Times|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same interview, he expressed skepticism that Germany would risk its trade relations with Iran by protesting the Rushdie fatwa. Because of this statement, Social Democratic politician Freimut Duve called for Mousavian's expulsion, saying that he had, in effect, publicly expressed agreement with the fatwa; politicians from other parties echoed Duve's call. The German Foreign Ministry, moreover, summoned Mousavian to a meeting.&lt;ref name="Press Association"&gt;{{cite web|title=German call to expel Iranian envoy|url=http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?cc=&amp;pushme=1&amp;tmpFBSel=all&amp;totaldocs=&amp;taggedDocs=&amp;toggleValue=&amp;numDocsChked=0&amp;prefFBSel=0&amp;delformat=CITE&amp;fpDocs=&amp;fpNodeId=&amp;fpCiteReq=&amp;expNewLead=id%3D%22expandedNewLead%22&amp;brand=ldc&amp;dedupeOption=0&amp;_m=3c95f50665f079733f67322481f5d9a6&amp;docnum=246&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=201&amp;wchp=dGLzVzt-zSkAA&amp;_md5=6216a1cac0aeef310e0d75560abf56c7&amp;focBudTerms=&amp;focBudSel=all|publisher=Press Association|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Iran==
Subsequently, he headed the Foreign Relations Committee of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) of Iran during the eight years of Mohammad Khatami's presidency. Mousavian meanwhile continued his education in the late 1990s, receiving a master's degree from the [[University of Tehran]] in 1998 and a PhD from the [[University of Kent]] in the UK in international relations in 2002.

He later served as Foreign Policy Advisor to Ali Larijani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (2005-7), and Vice President of the Center for Strategic Research and in a variety of capacities for the Expediency Discernment Council's Center for Strategic Research (CSR) from 2005 to 2008. During this period he was Editor-in-Chief or a member of the Editorial Board for numerous CSR publications, including the ''Journal of Human Rights Studies'', ''Journal of International Security and Terrorism'', ''Rahbord (Strategy) Magazine'', and ''Journal of Disarmament''.

==Role in Iranian diplomacy==

Mousavian played a role in a number of key developments during his more than two decades working on Iranian foreign affairs. He helped to secure the release of two German hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon from 1990 to 1993 and American and other Western hostages held in Lebanon in 1998–1999, as well as contributing to the mediation of the largest-ever humanitarian exchange between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah under Germany's auspices (1995–1996). Mousavian also played a role in Iran's cooperation with the US in Afghanistan against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in 2001. From 2003 to 2005, Mousavian was Spokesman of the Iranian nuclear negotiation team, which in 2003 agreed for Iran to provisionally suspend uranium enrichment and allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency at its nuclear sites as confidence building measures. In 2004, while head of the negotiating team, Mousavian asserted Iran's sovereign right to pursue nuclear technology for civilian use and expressed satisfaction that the U.S. had been “isolated” at the IAEA in its attempt to pressure Iran.&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;{{cite web|last=Haeri|first=Safa|title=IRAN WARNED IAEA TO REPORT IT TO THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE|url=http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2004/september/iran_nuclear_17904.shtml|publisher=Iran Press Service|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousavian's team was replaced shortly before the election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] as President in 2005, in tandem with Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]]'s announcement that Iran would resume enrichment activities.&lt;ref name="wsj iran"&gt;{{cite web|last=Soloman|first=Jay|title=Iranian Diplomat in U.S. Opens Window on Tehran|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704846004575332754213432126|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of espionage==

Mousavian was arrested and briefly jailed by the [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Ahmadinejad]] administration in 2007 and publicly accused by the president of espionage for allegedly providing classified information to Europeans, including the British Embassy, before being cleared by the judiciary.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran official charged with spying|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7094683.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was speculation that his arrest was part of a factional struggle between Ahmadinejad and a triumvirate of his opponents: [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], [[Mohammad Khatami]], and [[Hassan Rouhani]], of whom Mousavian was considered an ally.&lt;ref name=rferl&gt;{{cite web|last=Esfandiari|first=Golnaz|title=Former Nuclear Negotiator Was A Spy, Says Iranian Ministry|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Former_Nuclear_Negotiator_Was_A_Spy_Says_Iranian_Ministry/2137341.html|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year, a spokesman of Iran's judiciary announced that Mousavian had been cleared of the espionage charge after an investigation by three different judges. However, the third of those judges had sentenced him to a suspended term of two years in prison and to a five-year ban from holding official diplomatic posts because of his confessed opposition to the foreign and nuclear policy of President Ahmadinejad.

Accusations were renewed on August 22, 2010, when the Ministry of Intelligence issued a statement repeating the old claims publicly announced by Ahmadinejad in 2007.&lt;ref name=farau&gt;{{cite web|title=وزارت اطلاعات: موسویان جاسوس بود|url=http://www.fararu.com/vdcc4mqp.2bq0o8laa2.html|publisher=Farau|accessdate=24 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704195242/http://fararu.com/vdcc4mqp.2bq0o8laa2.html|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousavian's lawyer has questioned this development, arguing that the Ministry of Intelligence statement ran contrary to the verdict reached three years earlier by the Iranian judiciary.

==Post at Princeton and controversy==
[[File:Dr Patricia Lewis, Sir Richard Dalton, Dr Seyed Hossein Mousavian at Chatham House.jpg|thumb|Dr Patricia Lewis, Sir Richard Dalton, Dr Seyed Hossein Mousavian (left to right) at the Chatham House event Nuclear Iran: Negotiating a Way Out.]]
Mousavian has been a visiting research scholar at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs since 2009.&lt;ref name="princeton edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seyed Hossein Mousavian|url=http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/faculty-staff/seyed-hossein-mousavian/|publisher=Princeton|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' in September 2012, Reuel Marc Gerecht argued that Mousavian's Western admirers, who see him as “a guide to a possible resolution” of the Iran crisis, “have been as naïve as he has been deceitful.... To journalists and American officials, he has tried with conviction to make the case for Tehran’s 'peaceful' nuclear program. For him, the Iranian regime is 'misunderstood,' and the West, even under [[Barack Obama|President Obama]], has been too hostile and suspicious. Sufficient Western concessions and greater Western sensitivity are the keys to solving the nuclear contretemps.”  Mousavian's “assertions that Khamenei’s intent isn’t threatening,” noted Gerecht, “are followed by hints that a bomb might, nonetheless, be logical for the Islamic Republic to develop, especially given the threatening behavior of the United States and Israel.” Gerecht further pointed out that Mousavian, in his writings and talks, is consistently “respectful towards Supreme Leader Khamenei.”

Gerecht noted that "Mousavian at times claims to know a lot about Iran’s nuclear program, and then, when accusations from the IAEA are too cutting, not much at all." For example, "Mousavian knew not a thing" about the uranium-enrichment facility at Fordow until President Obama's press conference about it. Citing Mousavian's expression of trust in "the supreme leader’s fatwa banning the use or production of nuclear weapons," Gerecht observes wryly that "Mousavian is putting his trust in the man who demolished his world, incarcerated him, and forced him and his family into exile. It would be easy to say that Mousavian is just lying—and he is. But what is more intriguing is how hard it is for him to reflect critically on the revolution. In his eyes still, Iran’s faults are mostly American in origin—or tactical mistakes made by his archenemy, Ahmadinejad. Like battered Communists of old who just couldn’t stop loving the Soviet Union, Mousavian remains a party apparatchik who still loves the cause....There isn’t a word, even from the safety of Princeton, about the dark side of Khamenei and his Revolutionary Guards’ having the bomb. Little men like Mousavian—ideologues whose identities were created by the revolution—just can’t flip."&lt;ref name="weekly standard" /&gt;

==Current views==

Mousavian expressed deep concern about developments in Iran after that country's 2009 presidential election, but continued “to press for the U.S. to engage Tehran in a bid to reduce regional tensions,” according to a 2010 article by Jay Solomon in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. Mousavian believes that any future Iranian government will continue to pursue a nuclear fuel program, and that the U.S. should therefore improve relations with Tehran as a safeguard against an atomic weapons program. He also opposes UN sanctions against Iran, saying they “only serve to radicalize [Tehran’s] position.” Instead of imposing sanctions, the U.S. should “shape a comprehensive dialogue with Iran based on shared interests in stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan” and “should develop with Tehran a broad security plan for the Persian Gulf that could prove crucial to securing the free flow of energy in and out of the strategic waterway.”&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;

Mousavian dismissed as “politically motivated” the conclusions of a November 2011 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that suggested “possible military dimensions” to Iran's nuclear program.&lt;ref name="Asia Society"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ali Khan|first=Annie|title=Interview: Ambassador Hossein Mousavian on Iran, Washington and the Middle East|url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/interview-ambassador-hossein-mousavian-iran-washington-and-middle-east|publisher=Asia Society|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''National Interest'' in December 2012, Mousavian questioned the assumption by Western powers that “the best hope of altering Tehran’s nuclear policy and halting its enrichment activities” lies in “comprehensive international sanctions and a credible threat of military strike.” Mousavian maintained that "such punitive pressures... will not change the Iranian leadership’s mindset, and that a military option would be catastrophic" for everyone. Besides, he insisted, Iran has no interest in acquiring nuclear weapons. He offered ten reasons why this is the case, among them that developing nuclear weaponry would be considered “forbidden or haram” under Islam, would “trigger a regional nuclear arms race,” and would be contrary to Iran's goal of becoming a modern nation.&lt;ref name="national interest"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mousavian|first=Seyed|title=Commentary: Ten Reasons Iran Doesn't Want the Bomb|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802|publisher=National Interest|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another December 2012 article, Mousavian argued that "U.S. strategists... should understand... the role of religion and clerics" in Iran. Noting that the world's “most powerful ideological-political party... is the Shia Cleric Organization in Iran,” he complained that “Western policymakers and some of their ‘Iranian experts’... have yet to realize that the clerical system... is a collective decision-making process, with heated discussions and debates among about twenty of the most revered Grand Ayatollahs in the country." Washington, he emphasized, “needs to recognize that Islam is the main source of Iranian power, and the religious establishments will play a key role in the future developments of Iran and the region....Instead of changing Iran’s government, the United States should focus its regional policy on three key areas: addressing the Palestinian issue, engaging moderate Islamists, and pursuing a regional security pact.”&lt;ref name=princeton&gt;{{cite web|last=Mousavian|first=Houssein|title=An Opportunity for a U.S.–Iran Paradigm Shift|url=https://www.princeton.edu/sgs/faculty-staff/seyed-hossein-mousavian/Iran-US-Paradigm-Shift.pdf|publisher=The Washington Quarterly|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 2013 ''New York Times'' op-ed headlined "How to Talk to Iran," Mousavian and Mohammed Ali Shabani argued that there will be no “resolution of the nuclear standoff” between Iran and the West if Western leaders fail to grasp two key concepts: "maslahat," meaning "expediency, or self-interest" and "aberu," meaning "face – as in, saving face." For millennia, they wrote, "Persian culture has been distinguished by customs that revolve around honor and esteem....There are almost no instances in modern Iranian history when maslahat has trumped aberu. The West has poorly understood these concepts. This was particularly true under President Bush, who rewarded Iran’s tacit acceptance of the American invasion of Afghanistan by labeling Iran a member of an 'axis of evil.'" Mousavian and Shabani expressed the belief that "Iran would be open to new measures regarding the transparency of its nuclear program, and would agree not to pursue any capability to enrich uranium beyond that needed to fuel atomic power plants, if its legitimate right to enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty was recognized and if an agreement to remove sanctions was reached."&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Mousavian|first=Seyed|title=How to Talk to Iran|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/opinion/how-to-talk-to-iran.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Iranian Nuclear Crisis: A Memoir''==
Reviewing Mousavian's 2012 book, ''Iranian Nuclear Crisis: A Memoir'' in the ''Wall Street Journal'', [[Sohrab Ahmari]] said that although the book “is billed as a memoir,” it is more of “a diplomatic brief, complete with awkward bureaucratic prose and key sections stippled by bullet points.” Ahmari drew attention to “the endnotes, where an editor apparently felt obliged to acknowledge where the author parts company with the public record,” as in an assertion that Iran had fully disclosed the details of its nuclear activities to the IAEA.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;

[[Image:Staple (PSF).png|thumb|upright|A staple (from which the paper fastener was developed)]]

A '''staple''' is a type of two-pronged [[fastener]], usually [[metal]], used for joining or binding materials together. Large staples might be used with a [[hammer]] or [[staple gun]] for [[masonry]], [[Roofing material|roofing]], [[corrugated box]]es and other heavy-duty uses. Smaller staples are used with a [[stapler]] to attach pieces of paper together; such staples are a more permanent and durable fastener for paper documents than the [[paper clip]].
[[File:Tacker1.gif|thumb|Using a staple]]
==Etymology==
[[File:Staple 1775.png|left | thumb |A 1775 definition of the English word ''staple'']]
The word "staple" originated in the late thirteenth Century, from [[Old English]] ''stapol'', meaning "post, pillar".  The word's first usage in the paper-fastening sense is attested from 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=staple|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=staple&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Advantages==
[[Image:U Shape Insulated Staple 01.JPG|right | thumb| An insulated staple]]
* Most kinds of staples are easier to produce than [[nail (engineering)|nail]]s or [[screw]]s.
* The crown of the staple can be used to bridge materials butted together.
* The crown can bridge a piece and fasten it without puncturing with a leg on either side, e.g. fastening [[electrical cable]]s to wood framing.
* The crown provides greater surface area than other comparable fasteners. This is generally more helpful with thinner materials.

==Staples in construction==
Construction staples are commonly larger,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQlJw2_gE-cC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=Construction+staples+are+larger,+have+a+more+varied+use+and+applied+via+staple+gun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif1tD3qPnWAhVH1WMKHaOOAc0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Construction%20staples%20are%20larger,%20have%20a%20more%20varied%20use%20and%20applied%20via%20staple%20gun&amp;f=false|title=Scientific Examination of Questioned Documents, Second Edition|last=Kelly|first=Jan Seaman|last2=Lindblom|first2=Brian S.|date=2006-04-27|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420003765|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a more varied use, and are delivered by a [[staple gun]] or [[hammer tacker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagostaplewarehouse.com/collections/heavy-wire-staples|title=Heavy-Wire Staple Staples|website=Allen Staple &amp; Nail Corp.|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Staple gun]]s do not have backing anvils and are exclusively used for tacking (with the exception of outward-clinch staplers used for fastening duct insulation). They typically have staples made from thicker metal.  Some staple guns use arched staples for fastening small cables, e.g. phone or cable TV, without damaging the cable. Devices known as hammer tackers or staple hammers operate without complex mechanics as a simple head loaded with a strip of staples drives them directly; this method requires a measure of skill. Powered electric staplers or pneumatic staplers drive staples easily and accurately; they are the simplest manner of applying staples, but are hindered by a cord or hose. Cordless electric staplers use a battery, typically rechargeable and sometimes replaceable.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Deutsch, "Arrow Cordless Stapler Early Review" https://toolguyd.com/arrow-cordless-stapler-early-review/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paper staples==

[[Image:Three staples.jpg|left | thumb|Staples in use, showing the front side (center), and two examples of the back side: the legs bent outward on the left, and inward on the right]]
[[Image:Postegrampos.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Paper staples in a [[utility pole]] in [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]], [[Toronto]].]]
The term "stapling" is used for both fastening sheets of paper together with bent legs or fastening sheets of paper to something solid with straight legs; however, when differentiating between the two, the term "tacking" is used for straight-leg stapling, while the term "stapling" is used for bent-leg stapling.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

===Staple specifications===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Modern staples for paper staplers are made from [[Plating#Zinc_plating|zinc-plated]] [[steel]] wires glued together and bent to form a long strip of staples. Staple strips are commonly available as "full strips" with 210 staples per strip.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Both copper plated and more expensive [[stainless steel]] staples which do not rust are also available, but uncommon.{{vague|date=October 2016}}

Some staple sizes are used more commonly than others, depending on the application required. Some companies have unique staples just for their products.  Staples from one manufacturer may or may not fit another manufacturers unit even if they look similar and serve the same purpose.

Staples are often described as X/Y (e.g. 24/6 or 26/6), where the first number X is the [[American wire gauge|gauge]] of the wire, and the second number Y is the length of the shank (leg) in millimeters. Some exceptions to this rule include staple sizes like No. 10.

Common sizes for the home and office include: 26/6, 24/6, 24/8, 13/6, 13/8 and No. 10 for mini staplers.  Common sizes for heavy duty staplers include: 23/8, 23/12, 23/15, 23/20, 23/24, 13/10, and 13/14.

Stapleless staplers cut and bend paper without using metal fasteners.

====Standards====
[[File:Basic staple diagram (named parts).svg|left|upright|thumb|Diagram of staple]]
[[Image:Staplerfunction.JPG|thumb]]
There are few standards for staple size, length and thickness.  This has led to many different incompatible staples and staplers systems, all serving the same purpose or applications.

24/6 staples are described by the German [[DIN]] 7405 standard.

In the [[United States]], the specifications for non-medical industrial staples are described in [[ASTM International|ASTM]] F1667-15, Standard Specification for Driven Fasteners: Nails, Spikes, and Staples. A heavy duty office staple might be designated as F1667 STFCC-04: ST indicates staple, FC indicates flat top crown, C indicates cohered (joined into a strip), and 04 is the dash number for a staple with a length of 0.250&amp;nbsp;inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm), a leg thickness of 0.020&amp;nbsp;inch (500 μm), a leg width of 0.030&amp;nbsp;inch (800 μm), and a crown width of 0.500&amp;nbsp;inch (13&amp;nbsp;mm).

===Staples in the home===
[[File:Leitz_stapler.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A common stapler with a dual-function anvil that can bend legs inward or outward]]
The most common staples are used with paper.  They are almost exclusively applied with a mechanical stapler which clinches the legs after they pass through the paper. Staples of this type are used with a desktop stapling machine.

When stapling with a stapler the papers to be fastened are placed between the main body and the [[anvil]]. The papers are pinched between the body and the anvil, then a drive blade pushes on the crown of the staple on the end of the staple strip. The staple breaks from the end of the strip and the legs of the staple are forced through the paper.  As the legs hit the grooves in the anvil they are bent to hold the pages together.  Many staplers have an anvil in the form of a "pinning" or "stapling" switch.  This allows a choice between bending in or out. The outward bent staples are easier to remove and are for temporary fastening or "pinning".

Most staplers are capable of stapling without the anvil to drive straight leg staples for tacking.

There are various types of staples for paper, including heavy-duty staples, designed for use on documents 20, 50, or over 100 pages thick. There are also speedpoint staples, which have slightly sharper teeth so they can go through paper more easily.

===Staples in business===
[[File:Booklet_stapler_rotate_1.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A stapler with a body that can be rotated for booklets]]
Staples are commonly considered to be a neat and efficient method of binding paperwork such as letters and documents in all areas of office business. This is predominantly because of the low cost and high availability of the staple, and because its small size does not detract from the content of the document.

The large staples found on corrugated cardboard boxes have folded legs, but they are applied from the outside and do not use an anvil; jaw-like appendages push through the cardboard alongside the legs and bend them from the outside.

[[Saddle stitch stapler]]s, also known as "booklet staplers," feature a longer reach from the pivot point than general-purpose staplers and are used to bind pages into a booklet or "signature". Some, such as the Ring King, can also use "loop-staples" that enable the user to integrate folded matter into ring books and binders.

[[Outward clinch staple]]s are blind staples, i.e. there is no anvil, and they are applied with a [[staple gun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.astm.org/Standards/F592.htm | title = Standard Terminology of Collated and Cohered Fasteners and Their Application Tools | publisher = [[ASTM International]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When applied, each staple leg forms a curve bending outwards.  This is in part caused by the shape of the crown, which is like an inverted "V", and not flat as in ordinary staples. Also, the legs are sharpened with an inside bevel point, causing them to tend to go outwards when forced into the base material. These staples are used for [[upholstery]] work, especially in vehicles, where they are used for fastening fabric or leather to a foam base. These staples are also used when installing fiberglass insulation batts around air ducts- the FSK paper sheathing is overlapped, and the two layers are stapled together before sealing with tape.

===Staples in packaging===
Staples are used in various types of [[packaging]].
* Staples can attach items to [[paperboard]] for carded packaging
* Staples of stitches can be used to attach the manufacturer's joint of [[corrugated box]]es
* Staples are used to close corrugated boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = [[ASTM]] | title = D1974, Standard Practice for Closure of Corrugated Boxes}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Small (nominally ½&amp;nbsp;inch crown) staples can be applied to a box with a post stapler.  Wider crown (nominally 1¼ inch) staples can be applied with a blind clincher
* Staples can help fabricate and attach paperwork to [[wooden box]]es and [[crate]]s.

==Staples in medicine==
{{Main|Surgical staples}}
[[File:Wunde mit Epigard.jpg|thumb]]
[[Image:Cdm hip staples 376.jpg|thumb|100px|upright|Surgical staples used on a hip]]

[[Surgical staple]]s are used for the closing of incisions and wounds, a function also performed by [[Surgical suture|sutures]].

==History==
In ancient times, the staple had different functions.

Large metal staples dating from the 6th century BC have been found in the masonry works of the [[Persian empire]] (ancient Iran). For the construction of the [[Pasargadae]] and later [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], these staples, which are known as "dovetail" or "swallowtail" staples, were used for tightening stones together.

The home stapling machine was developed by Henry Heyl in 1877 and registered under US Patent No. 195,603.  Heyl's companies, [[American Paper-Box Machine Company]], [[Novelty Paper Box Company]], and [[Standard Box Company]], all of Philadelphia, manufactured machinery using staples in paper packaging and for saddle stitching.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Comparato, ''Books for the Millions: A History of the Men Whose Methods and Machines Packaged the Printed Word'', Stackpole Co., Harrisburg, PA, 1971, p. 137ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synthetic crude''' is the output from a bitumen/extra heavy oil [[upgrader]] facility used in connection with [[oil sands|oil sand]] production. It may also refer to [[shale oil]], an output from an [[oil shale]] [[pyrolysis]]. The properties of the synthetic crude depend on the processes used in the upgrading. Typically, it is low in sulfur and has an [[API gravity]] of around 30. It is also known as "upgraded crude".

Synthetic crude is an intermediate product produced when an extra-heavy or [[unconventional oil]] source is upgraded into a transportable form. Synthetic crude is then shipped to oil refineries where it is further upgraded into finished products. Synthetic crude may also be mixed, as a diluent, with heavy oil to create [[dilbit|synbit]]. Synbit is more viscous than synthetic crude, but can also be a less expensive alternative for transporting heavy oil to a conventional refinery.

[[Syncrude|Syncrude Canada]], [[Suncor Energy|Suncor Energy Inc.]], and [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]] are the three largest worldwide producers of synthetic crude with a cumulative production of approximately {{convert|600000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. The NewGrade Energy Upgrader became operational in 1988, and was the first upgrader in Canada, now part of the [[CCRL Refinery Complex]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Toboggan Party.jpg|thumb|''The Toboggan Party'', [[Rideau Hall]], illuminated composite photograph from [[Hariot Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava|Lady Dufferin's]] personal album. c. 1872-1875]]
A '''toboggan''' is a simple [[sled]] which is a traditional form of transport used by the [[Innu]] and [[Cree]] of northern Canada.

In modern times, it is used on snow to carry one or more people (often children) down a hill or other slope for recreation.  Designs vary from simple, traditional models to modern engineered composites. A toboggan differs from most sleds or sleighs in that it has no runners or skis (or only low ones) on the underside. The bottom of a toboggan rides directly on the snow. Some parks include designated toboggan hills where ordinary sleds are not allowed and which may include toboggan runs similar to [[bobsleigh]] courses. &lt;ref&gt;[http://grammarist.com/interesting-words/sled-sledge-sleigh-and-toboggan/ Sled, Sledge, Sleigh, and Toboggan] grammarist.com differentiation of sledding types&lt;/ref&gt;

Toboggans can vary depending on the climate and geographical region. Such examples are [[Tangalooma, Queensland|Tangalooma (Australia)]] where Toboggans are made from Masonite boards and used for travelling down steep sand dunes at speeds up to 40km per hour.

==Overview==
The traditional toboggan is made of bound, parallel wood slats, all bent up and backwards at the front to form a recumbent 'J' shape. A thin rope is run across the edge of end of the curved front to provide rudimentary steering. The frontmost rider places their feet in the curved front space and sits on the flat bed; any others sit behind them and grasp the waist of the person before them.

Modern recreational toboggans are typically manufactured from wood or plastic or aluminum. Larger, more rugged models are made for commercial or rescue use. 

[[File:Sledding.jpg|thumb|Canadian child carrying his modern toboggan, December 2010.]]

{{quote|The Mountaineer [Innu] method is the only one adapted for the interior parts of the country: their sleds are made of two thin boards of birch; each about six inches broad, a quarter of an inch thick, and six feet long: these are fastened parallel to each other by slight battens, sewed on with thongs of deer-skin; and the foremost end is curved up to rise over the inequalities of the snow. Each individual who is able to walk, is furnished with one of these; but those for the children are proportionately less. On them they stow all their goods, and also their infants; which they bundle up very warm in deer-skins. The two ends of a leather thong are tied to the corners of the sled; the bight or double part of which is placed against the breast, and in that manner it is drawn along. The men go first, relieving each other in the lead by turns; the women follow next, and the children, according to their strength, bring up the rear; and, as they all walk in rackets ([[snowshoe]]s), the third or fourth person finds an excellent path to walk on, let the snow be ever so light.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend 1911:357–358.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In popular culture==
The toboggan is a recurring prop in the [[Calvin and Hobbes]] comic. Comic author [[Bill Watterson]] uses it (or, alternatively, a wagon) as "a simple device to add some physical comedy to the strip, and most often use[s] it when Calvin gets longwinded or philosophical."&lt;ref name="The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watterson|first=Bill|title=The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book|year=1995|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|location=Kansas City, MO|isbn=0-8362-0438-7|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''tornado preparedness'''" refers to [[safety]] precautions made before the arrival of and during a [[tornado]]. Historically, the steps taken have varied greatly, depending on location, or time remaining before a tornado was expected. For example, in rural areas, people might prepare to enter an external [[storm cellar]], in case the main building collapses, and thereby allow exit without needing rescue from the main building as in urban areas. Because [[tropical storm]]s have spawned many tornadoes, hurricane preparations also involve tornadoes. The term "tornado preparedness" has been used by government agencies, emergency response groups, schools,&lt;ref&gt;
   "Tornado Preparedness Tips for School Administrators",
   NOAA.gov, 2010, web:
   [http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/school.html NOAA-sch].
&lt;/ref&gt; insurance companies, and others.

== Understanding the dangers ==
Preparedness involves knowing the major dangers to avoid. Some tornadoes are the most violent storms in nature.&lt;ref name="Ftorn"&gt;
   "Tornado", FEMA.gov, August 2010, web:
   [http://www.fema.gov/hazard/tornado/index.shtm FEMA-tornado] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429174402/http://www.fema.gov/hazard/tornado/index.shtm |date=2011-04-29 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes have varied in strength, and some tornadoes have been mostly invisible due to a lack of loose dirt or debris in the funnel cloud.&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt; Spawned from severe [[thunderstorm]]s, tornadoes have caused fatalities and devastated neighborhoods within seconds of arrival.
[[File:Tornado with no funnel.jpg|right|thumb|A tornado with no obvious funnel from the upper clouds, although the rotating dust cloud indicates strong winds at the surface.]]

A tornado operates as a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud that extends downward from a thunderstorm, to the ground, with swirling winds which have reached {{convert|300|mph}}.&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt; The wind speed might be difficult to imagine: traveling the length of a U.S. [[American football|football field]] within 1 second&lt;ref&gt;
   A speed of 300 miles per hour is 300*5280 = 1,584,000 feet per
   hour, or 440 feet (134 m) per second.
&lt;/ref&gt; (over {{convert|130|m|ft|sp=us|disp=or}} per second). Damage paths have been in excess of {{convert|spell=in |1|mi|km|adj=mid|wide}} and {{convert|50|mi|km|disp=x| long (|)}}.&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt;

Not all tornadoes are easily seen. A tornado funnel can be transparent until reaching an area with loose dirt and debris.&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt; Also, some tornadoes have been seen against sunlit areas, but rain or nearby low-hanging clouds has obscured other tornadoes. Occasionally, tornadoes have developed so suddenly, so rapidly, that little, if any, advance warning was possible.&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt;

Before a tornado strikes an area, the wind has been known to die down and the air to become very still.&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt;{{dubious|Calm before the storm|reason=Not necessarily true|date=January 2013}} A cloud of debris has sometimes marked the bottom of a tornado even when the funnel was not visible. Tornadoes typically occur along the trailing edge of a thunderstorm.

The following is a summary of typical tornadoes:&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt;

:* They may strike quickly, with little or no warning.
:* They may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel.
:* The average tornado moves Southwest to Northeast in the U.S., but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction.
:* The average forward speed of a tornado is {{convert|30|mph}}, but has varied from stationary to {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}.
:* Tornadoes can also accompany tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land.
:* [[Waterspout]]s are tornadoes that form over water.
:* Tornadoes are most frequently reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months.
:* Peak tornado season in the southern [[U.S. state]]s is March through May; in the northern states, it is late spring through early summer.
:* Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. (local time), but have occurred at other times.&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt;


== Steps when expecting storms to arrive ==
The U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has advised the following precautions before a storm reaches an area:&lt;ref name="Fprec"&gt;
   "What to do Before a Tornado",
   FEMA.gov, August 2010, web:
   [http://www.fema.gov/hazard/tornado/to_before.shtm FEMA-to] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502103857/http://www.fema.gov/hazard/tornado/to_before.shtm |date=2011-05-02 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CompleteTornadoemergencykit.jpg|thumb|Example of a tornado emergency kit ]]
:* Be alert to the changing weather conditions.
:* Listen to [[NOAA Weather Radio]] and/or [[Skywarn]], or to local commercial radio or television newscasts for the latest information. 
:* Watch various common danger signs, including: 
::* dark, often greenish-colored sky;&lt;ref name=Fprec/&gt;
::* large [[hail]] stones;
::* a large, dark, low-lying cloud (particularly if rotating);
::* loud roar of wind, sounding similar to a [[freight train]].
Upon seeing an approaching storm or noticing any of the danger signs, they were advised to prepare to take shelter immediately,&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt; such as moving to a [[safe room]], internal stairway, or other safe-haven area.

All individuals and families should have a disaster preparedness kit made prior to tornado. According to FEMA the kit should include items needed to shelter in place in the event of a disaster such as a tornado for up to 72 hours following impact. 

== Actions taken during tornadoes ==
During August 2010, FEMA advised people to perform the following actions when a tornado struck.&lt;ref name="Fdur"&gt;
   "What to Do During a Tornado", FEMA.gov, August 2010, web:
   [http://www.fema.gov/hazard/tornado/to_during.shtm FEMA-dur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425051859/http://www.fema.gov/hazard/tornado/to_during.shtm |date=2011-04-25 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class=wikitable style="margin-right:0em;"
! Location || Action taken
|-
| valign=top |
In a structure (e.g. residence, small building, school, nursing home, hospital, factory, shopping center, high-rise building,restaurant)
| valign=top |
They were to enter a pre-designated shelter area such as a [[safe room]], basement, [[storm cellar]], or the lowest building level.&lt;ref name=Fdur/&gt; If there was no basement, then to the center of an interior room on the lowest level (closet, interior hallway) away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. The goal has been to put as many walls as possible between there and the outside. They were advised to get under a sturdy table and use arms to protect head and neck, and not open windows.&lt;ref name=Fdur/&gt;
|-
| valign=top |
In a vehicle, trailer, or mobile home
| valign=top |
They were advised to leave immediately and enter the lowest floor of a sturdy, nearby building or a [[storm shelter]].&lt;ref name=Fdur/&gt; Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection from tornadoes.&lt;ref name=Fdur/&gt; If a car is flipped by high winds, there is also the danger of broken glass.
|-
| valign=top |
On the outside with no shelter
| valign=top |
They were advised to lie flat in a nearby ditch or depression and cover head with their hands.&lt;ref name=Fdur/&gt; Also, to beware of the potential for flooding there.

They were advised to not stay under an overpass or bridge (where winds or debris might be funneled). It was safer to be in a low, flat location.&lt;ref name=Fdur/&gt;

The advice was to never try to outrun a tornado in urban or congested areas in a car or truck, but instead, to leave the vehicle immediately for safe shelter.

Flying debris from tornadoes causes most fatalities and injuries.&lt;ref name=Fdur/&gt;
|}
Because some preparations vary, depending on location, people have been advised to consult their local area preparedness plans, rather than assume the plans are similar for all areas, such as which local buildings have been designated as storm shelters.

A 2012 study of tornado injuries found that wearing a helmet such as those used for American football or bicycling, is an effective way to reduce injuries and deaths from head trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uab.edu/icrc/tornado_helmet_com.html|title=ICRC|website=www.uab.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/26/136645164/how-to-survive-a-tornado-plan-ahead-avoid-debris|title=How To Survive A Tornado: Plan Ahead, Avoid Debris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012, the CDC endorsed only general head protection, but recommended that if helmets are to be used, they be kept close by to avoid wasting time searching for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2012-05-17|accessdate=2013-08-18|title=Helmet and Tornado Statement|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/disasters/tornadoes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2013 Moore tornado]], it became apparent that thousands of people attempt to flee major tornadoes, and this has been credited with reducing the death toll.  However, during this event some people were killed as the tornado passed over the traffic jam caused by the impromptu evacuation.  In addition to urban traffic, evacuation can also be hampered by flash flooding produced by associated thunderstorms, and the need to be certain about the position and direction of the tornado.  Others who did not flee the Moore tornado were also killed because the buildings they were hiding in were completely destroyed, highlighting the need for storm shelters and safe rooms constructed specifically to withstand very high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/06/01/187876338/no-universal-best-practice-to-save-yourself-from-tornadoes|agency=NPR|author=Wade Goodwin|date=2013-06-01|accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Long-term preparations ==
Depending on location, various safe-haven areas have been prepared. The goal has been to avoid outer walls which might collapse when a roof section becomes airborne and the walls below lose their upper support: many interior rooms resist collapse longer, due to smaller walls interconnected to each other, while outer walls deflect the force of the winds. Because [[mobile home]]s typically lack foundation anchors and present a large surface-area sail (to catch wind), the advice has been to seek a safe haven elsewhere, such as in a stronger nearby building.&lt;ref name=Fdur/&gt; When a mobile home begins to roll, people have been injured by hitting objects inside, or being crushed when a trailer suddenly hits the ground and begins to collapse around them.

In a multi-story building, an internal stairway (away from broken windows) often acts as a safe haven, due to the stairs reinforcing the walls and blocking any major debris falling from above. If a stairway is lined with windows, then there would be the danger of flying glass, so an interior stairway, or small inner room, would be preferable.

In private homes, some similar stairway rooms have been used, or an interior room/closet kept clear to quickly allow entry when a storm is seen or heard approaching (the wind roar intensifies, sounding like a swift "[[freight train]]" coming nearer, louder).&lt;ref name=Ftorn/&gt; With weeks or months to prepare, an interior [[safe room]] can be constructed, with space for emergency water, food and flashlights, and a telephone to call for rescue if the exit becomes blocked by falling debris. Some above-ground safe rooms have been built with steel-[[rebar]] rods in cement-filled [[cinder block]]s, to withstand winds of {{convert|250|mph}}. Rural homes might have an outside [[storm cellar]], or other external bunker, to avoid being trapped within a collapsing house. In rural homes, generators are also helpful to maintain power with enough fuel for a few days.

There were no building codes requiring tornado shelters nor specifically designed to prevent tornado damage&lt;ref name="livescience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/13962-tornado-safety-building-codes.html|title=Why Aren't There Tornado Safety Building Codes?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the [[2011 Joplin tornado]] prompted a local ordinance requiring [[hurricane tie]]s or similar fasteners.  The state of Oklahoma adopted the minimum U.S. standard that year for the first time, but did not add high-wind protections like those in Florida designed to protect against hurricanes.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/08/us-usa-tornadoes-construction-insight-idUSBRE95707L20130608 | work=Reuters | title=Insight: In tornado alley, building practices boost damage | date=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateimpact.npr.org/oklahoma/2013/07/03/moore-officials-delay-vote-on-strengthening-building-codes/|title=Moore Officials Delay Vote on Upgrading Building Codes for Tornadoes - StateImpact Oklahoma|first=By Joe|last=Wertz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states in Tornado Alley have no statewide building codes.  The chance of any given location in Tornado Alley getting hit by an F-2 tornado (strong enough to do major structural damage and exceeding the 90&amp;nbsp;mph guideline for straightline winds) is about 1 every 4,000-5,000 years; in other areas the annual probability is one in several million.&lt;ref name="livescience" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825011156/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp|title=Tornado Alley, USA: Science News Online, May 11, 2002|date=25 August 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most stringent building codes only require earthquake strengthening for a 1 in every 500-1,000 year probability.&lt;ref name="livescience" /&gt;

The U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] has spent tens millions of dollars subsidizing the construction of shelters and safe rooms in both private and public buildings.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;  Many buildings in Tornado Alley do not have basements, because unlike in more northern areas, there is no need for a deep foundation to get below the [[frost line]], in some places the [[water table]] is high, and expansion and contraction of clay-heavy soils can produce additional pressure on buildings that can cause leaks if not reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/21/185857916/why-oklahomans-dont-like-basements|title=Why Oklahomans Don't Like Basements|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical preparations ==
Having a [[first aid kit]] in the safe haven is advised to help victims recover from minor injuries. People needing prescription medications could have a medicine bag ready to take to shelter. Some people have reported their "ears popping" due to the change in air pressure, but those effects seem to be temporary. Covering people with mattresses or cushions has helped avoid injury from flying debris,&lt;ref name=Fdur/&gt; as walls collapsed nearby.

Injuries sustained during a tornado vary in nature and in severity. The most common injuries experienced during a tornado are complex contaminated soft tissue wounds and account for more than 50% of the cases seen by emergency rooms following a tornado. These wounds will most likely be contaminated with soil and foreign bodies due to high wind speeds caused by tornadoes. Fractures are the second most common injury obtained after a tornado strikes and account for up to 30% of total injuries. Head injuries are also commonly reported during a tornado, but severe head injuries only account for less than 10% of the total. Even though only 10% of reported head injuries are severe, they are the most common cause of death following a tornado. Blunt trauma to the chest and abdomen are also injuries obtained following a tornado, but only account for less than 10% of overall injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogan|first=David|title=Disaster Medicine|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tornado drills==
[[File:Tornado drill.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Students participate in a tornado drill, lining up along an interior wall and covering their heads.]]
Tornado drills are an important element in tornado preparedness. Like any other safety drills, they increase chances of correct response to a real tornado threat.

Most states in the midwestern and southern United States conduct a statewide tornado drill in late winter or early spring in preparation for the severe weather season.  During these drills, the [[National Weather Service]] issues test [[tornado warning]]s, and local [[Emergency Alert System]]s and/or NOAA Weather Radio (normally as a Required Weekly Test or Required Monthly Test; Live Tornado Warning Codes can only be used if a waiver from the FCC is granted since "Live Code Testing" is prohibited per regulations) are activated along with outdoor warning sirens.  Schools and businesses may also conduct a tornado drill simultaneously.

A '''tornado drill'''  is a procedure of practicing to take cover in a specified location in the event that a [[tornado]] strikes an area. This [[:category:Safety drills|safety drill]] is an important element of tornado preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;"Disaster Prep 101", {{ISBN|0942369033}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8gYJ8wR720QC&amp;pg=PA154 pp154-155]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a signal is given, such as a series of tones (ex. Continuous Tone), or a voice announcement. Upon receiving the signal, building occupants of schools, hospitals, factories, shopping centers, etc. proceed to a designated location, usually an interior room or corridor with no windows, and assume a protective position.&lt;ref name="Florida"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greatamericanstormsheltersal.com/florida-disaster/|title=Florida Disaster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plano"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pisd.edu/about.us/safety/disaster.policy.shtml |title=Plano, Texas |publisher=Pisd.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514044534/http://pisd.edu/about.us/safety/disaster.policy.shtml |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In homes and small buildings one must go to the basement or an interior room on the lowest floor (closet, bathroom), to stay away from glass.

Cars and mobile homes must be abandoned, if there is small chance to drive away.

In some jurisdictions, schools are required to conduct regular tornado drills, though generally less frequently than [[fire drill]]s.

The '''Yuhua stone''' ({{zh|s=雨花石|p=''yuhua shi''|l=rain flower stone}}) is a special kind of stone found in [[Nanjing]], China, due to the unique geology of the area.  Yuhua stones, or pebbles, are of sedimentary origin and consist of minerals including quartz and other silicates.  They are found in the [[Yangtze River]], polished smooth by the action of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zgyhsw.com/post/370.html |title=雨花石形成分析 - 南京雨花石 - 中国雨花石网 |publisher=Zgyhsw.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22|trans-title=Stone formation analysis - Nanjing stone - Chinese stone Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colors include red, rose, yellow, green, and white.&lt;ref&gt;Xu Xiaomin, "Collector of Magic Pebbles".  Shanghai Star, 11 January 2000. [http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/history/00-01-11/l05-magic.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The origin of the Yuhua Stone is told through the legend of a Chinese monk named Yunguang (雲光) who lived during the [[Liang dynasty]]. Yunguang used to travel around the country to deliver sermons.One day, He travelled to Nanjing, there, he sat on the [[Guanghua Gate]] for three days, talking about his concept, without eating or drinking. According to the legend, his sincerity moved God deeply, so God rained thousands of colourful flowers from the sky to reward him. When the flowers touched the ground, they turned into the Yuhua Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cathay.ce.cn/special01/tea/jiangsu/yuhuacha/200604/11/t20060411_6668023.shtml |title=雨花石传说——华夏文明——中国经济网 |publisher=Cathay.ce.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22|trans-title=Stone legends - Chinese Civilization - China Economic Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
