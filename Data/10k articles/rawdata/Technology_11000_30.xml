The '''3Com Ergo Audrey''' is a discontinued [[internet appliance]] from [[3Com]]. It was released to the public on October 17, 2000 for [[United States dollar|USD]]499 as the only device in the company's "Ergo" initiative to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=3Com lets Audrey out the door | work=News.com | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once connected to an appropriate provider, users could access the [[internet]], send and receive [[e-mail]], play audio and video, and synchronize with up to two [[Palm OS]]-based devices.

''Audrey'' was the brainchild of Don Fotsch (formerly of [[Apple Computer]] and [[U.S. Robotics]]) and Ray Winninger. Don and Ray had a vision for a family of appliances, each designed for a specific room in the house. The brand ''Ergo'' was meant to convey that intent, as in "it's in the kitchen, ''[[wikt:ergo|ergo]]'' it's designed that way".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Direct Knowledge - I was there at the time that it was said. - Rob Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; There were plans to serve other rooms in the house as well. They considered the kitchen to be the heart of the home and the control room for the home manager. Don coined the phrase "Internet Snacking" to describe the lightweight web browsing done in this environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The name ''Audrey'' was given to this first product to honor [[Audrey Hepburn]]. It was meant to deliver the elegance that she exuded. The project codename was "[[Kojak]]", named after the [[Telly Savalas]] character. The follow-on product targeted for the family room was code named "[[Mannix]]".

3Com discontinued the product on June 1, 2001, in the wake of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com crash]], after only seven and a half months on the market. Only 3Com direct customers received full refunds for the product and accessories. Customers who had bought Audrey devices through other vendors were not offered refunds and never even notified about the refunds. The remaining Audrey hardware was liquidated and embraced by the [[hardware hacker]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audrey's life cut short|work=News.com|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-254497.html|accessdate=2010-01-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210072926/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-254497.html| archivedate= 10 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
The Audrey is a [[touchscreen]], passive matrix LCD device and came equipped with a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]].  All applications were touch-enabled.  Since the standard [[infrared]] keyboard was only needed for typing tasks, it could be hung out of the way on the rear of the unit.  The stylus was to be placed in a receptacle on the top of the screen with an [[light-emitting diode|LED]] that flashed when email arrived.  Buttons on the right side of the screen were used to access the web browser, email application, and calendar, and a wheel knob at the bottom selected different "channels" of [[push technology|push]] content.

The 3Com Audrey is powered by a 200 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] GX 1 [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]], with 16 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[flash ROM]] and 32 MB of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. It measures 9 x 11.8 x 3.0&amp;nbsp;inches (22.86 x 29.97 x 7.62&amp;nbsp;cm), and weighs 4.1 pounds (1.86&amp;nbsp;kg). It is powered by the [[QNX]] [[operating system]].  The Audrey is equipped with a [[modem]], two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports, and a [[CompactFlash]] socket.  A USB [[Ethernet]] adapter was commonly used for [[broadband]] subscribers.

The Audrey was also available in such shades as "linen" (off-white), "meadow" (green), "ocean" (blue), "slate" (grey), and "sunshine" (light yellow).

==Hacking==
After the demise of official support, the Audrey drew the attention of computer enthusiasts.  They quickly discovered an [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] to launch a pterm session.  Using [[privilege escalation]] techniques, the [[superuser|root]] password in the [[Passwd (file)|passwd]] file could be edited, opening the box to further experimentation.

Many of the tools for the [[QNX]] operating system development platform were quickly adapted for use in the Audrey, including an updated web browser ([[Voyager (web browser)|Voyager]]), an MP3 player, digital rotating photoframe, and other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3Com Ergo Audrey|work=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,34321,00.asp|accessdate=2010-01-15|first=Bruce|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CompactFlash slot was also investigated.  Although it could not be used for storage expansion, the Audrey was set to flash its operating system from the slot.  Soon, a variety of replacement OS images were distributed among enthusiasts.  As the device could utilize an optional Ethernet connection, it was an easy task to mount a remote disk drive served up by a neighboring desktop system, thus allowing for virtually unlimited storage capability.

==Similar devices==
Devices similar to the Audrey included the [[i-Opener]], the [[Virgin Webplayer]] and the [[Gateway Touch Pad]].

The '''[[Joint Electronics Type Designation System|AN/SLQ]]-49 Chaff Buoy Decoy System''', commonly referred to as "Rubber Duck", consists of inflatable radar-reflecting decoy buoys.  Used by the [[U.S. Navy]], [[Royal Navy]], and other [[NATO]] countries, the decoy is designed to seduce radar-guided [[anti-ship missile]]s by simulating the [[radar]] cross section of a ship. When deployed, the system launches into the water two [[octahedron]]-shaped inflatable decoy floats, connected by a {{convert|5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} cable.

The AN/SLQ-49 has been in operation since 1985.  Originally designed to confuse or distract enemy radar operators, it has demonstrated effective missile seduction capabilities.

[[File:VS50.jpg|right|thumb|Sand-colored [[VS-50 mine]] intended for use in desert environments (shown beside a wristwatch, for scale)]]

'''Anti-personnel mines''' are a form of [[Land mine|mine]] designed for use against humans, as opposed to [[anti-tank mine]]s, which are designed for use against vehicles. Anti-personnel mines may be classified into '''blast mines''' or '''fragmentation mines''', the latter may or may not be a [[bouncing mine]].

The mines are often designed to injure, not kill, their victims in order to increase the logistical (mostly medical) support required by enemy forces that encounter them. Some types of anti-personnel mines can also damage the tracks on armoured vehicles or the tires of wheeled vehicles.

The [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] has sought to ban mines culminating in the 1997 [[Ottawa Treaty]], although this treaty has not yet been accepted by a number of countries including the United States, Israel, Russia, the [[People's Republic of China]], Pakistan and India.

== Use ==
[[File:Valmara69 AP-mine.JPEG|thumb|upright|Italian [[Valmara 69]] [[bouncing mine|bouncing]] type anti-personnel mine]]
Anti-personnel mines are used in a similar manner to anti-tank mines, in static "mine fields" along national borders or in defense of strategic positions as described in greater detail in the [[land mine]] article. What makes them different from most anti-tank mines, however, is their smaller size, which enables large numbers to be simultaneously deployed over a large area. This process can be done manually, via dispensers on land vehicles, or from helicopters or aircraft. Alternatively, they can be dispensed by cargo-carrying artillery shells.

Other uses specific to anti-personnel mines are where they are deployed on an ad hoc basis in the following situations:

*When laying an ambush
*Protecting a temporary base
*To force any attackers to travel through a narrow, cleared path where firepower can be focused on the enemy
*To evade pursuit (e.g. [[M86 Pursuit Deterrent Munition]])
*To protect equipment by employing the mines as [[booby trap]]s
*To [[booby trap]] other mines as a form of [[anti-handling device]]

== Blast mines ==
[[File:Anti personnel mine.JPG|thumb|Anti personnel mine in Cambodia]]
Typically, anti-personnel blast mines are triggered when the victim steps on them. Their primary purpose is to blow the victim's foot or leg off, disabling them. Injuring, rather than killing, the victim is viewed as preferable in order to increase the logistical (evacuation, medical) burden on the opposing force.

=== Effect ===
When a person steps on a blast mine and activates it, the mine's main charge [[detonate]]s, creating a blast [[shock wave]] consisting of hot gases travelling at extremely high velocity. The shock wave sends a huge [[compressive stress|compressive force]] upwards, ejecting the mine casing and any soil covering the mine along with it. When the blast wave hits the surface, it quickly transfers the force into the subject's footwear and foot. This results in a massive compression force being applied. In most cases, the victim's foot is blown off by the blast wave.

The resulting injuries to a human body depend on the size of the mine's main charge, the depth, type of soil it was laid in and how the victim contacted it, e.g. stepping on the mine, using all or part of the foot. Different types of soil will result in different amounts of energy being transferred upward into the subject's foot, with saturated "clay-like" soil transferring the most. Larger main charges result in a release of significantly more energy, driving the blast wave further up a target's foot and leg and causing greater injury, in some cases even described as severe as [[traumatic amputation]] of the leg up to the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7926250.stm|title=Marine wins battle for bungalow|author=|date=5 March 2009|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary injuries from a blast mine are often caused by the material that has been torn loose by the mine's explosion. This consists of the soil and stones that were on top of the mine, parts of the victim's footwear and the small bones in the victim's foot. This debris creates wounds typical of similar secondary blast effects or [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]]. Special footwear, including combat boots or so-called "blast boots", is only moderately protective against the destructive effects of blast mines, and the loss of a foot is a typical outcome.

Blast mines have little effect on armoured vehicles, but can damage a wheeled vehicle if it runs directly over the mine. Small blast mines will severely damage a tire, rendering it irreparable while some types could also damage adjacent running gear.

=== Components ===
[[File:Anti-Personnel Mine (Blast Type).svg|thumb|Typical components of an anti-personnel blast mine]]

==== Mine casing ====
The mine casing houses the components of the mine and protects it from its environment. Early mines, such as the ones used in the World War II era, had casings made of steel or [[aluminium]]. However, by the middle of the conflict, the British Army was using the first, practical, portable metal detector—the [[Polish mine detector]]. The Germans responded with mines that had a [[Schu-mine 42|wooden]] or [[Glasmine 43|glass]] casing to make detection harder.

Wooden mines had been used by the Russians in 1939, before the appearance of metal detectors, in order to save steel. Some, like the [[PP Mi-D mine]], continued to be used into the 1980s as they were easy to make and hard to detect. Wood has the disadvantage of rotting and splitting, rendering the mine non-functional after a comparatively short time in the ground (or the advantage, in that the mine can be considered self-disabling, and will be less likely to cause unintended injuries years later).

Mines manufactured after the 1950s generally use plastic casings to hinder detection by electronic mine detectors. Some, referred to as [[minimum metal mine]]s, are constructed with as little metal as possible – often around {{convert|1|g|oz|}} – to make them difficult to detect. Mines containing absolutely no metal have been produced, but are uncommon. By its nature, a mine without any metal components in it cannot be found using a metal detector.

==== Pressure plate/fuze mechanism ====
The [[fuze]] mechanism is designed to set off the [[detonator]], either by striking it with a spring-loaded [[firing pin]], compressing a friction sensitive pyrotechnic composition, or by passing an electric charge through it. Most mines employ a spring-loaded striker that hits a stab detonator when activated by the victim. Typically, the detonator contains a tiny pellet of [[lead azide]]. The fuze is the most complicated component in any mine, although the amount of effort required to design and manufacture a simple fuze mechanism is quite low, similar to the retraction mechanism in a [[ballpoint pen]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} 
More sophisticated examples, such as the Italian [[SB-33 mine]] have a fuze mechanism that detonates the mine if subject to gradual, steady pressure, but locks the fuze if subject to a sudden shock. This defeats one of the main methods of clearing a path through a minefield — detonating the mines with explosive devices, such as [[mine-clearing line charge]]s.

==== Booster ====
The [[explosive booster|booster charge]] is a highly sensitive [[explosive]] that will activate easily when subjected to the shock of the [[detonator]]. Typically, a pea-sized pellet of [[RDX]] is used. The purpose of the booster is to amplify the shock of the detonator and initiate the main explosive charge.

==== Main charge ====
The main charge  consists of a stable explosive that is detonated by the booster charge. This is necessary, because making a mine out of a highly sensitive detonator or booster explosive would be more expensive, and make the device more sensitive and thereby susceptible to accidental [[detonation]]. In most AP blast mines [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[Composition B]] or [[phlegmatized]] RDX are used. On a US [[M14 mine]], 29 grams of [[tetryl]] is used, while 240 grams of TNT is used in a Russian [[PMN mine]].

=== Deployment ===
Anti-personnel blast mines are the most common type and are typically deployed on the surface (hidden by leaves or rocks) or buried under soil at a depth of 10 – 20&amp;nbsp;mm. They are activated by pressure, i.e. when the victim steps on them, but it could also be a vehicle driving over them.

They were designed for use as [[area denial weapons]]. Weapons of this type are supposed to deny opposing military forces access to a specific area.

== Fragmentation mines ==
[[File:Mémorial du Souvenir 16.JPG|thumb|280px|Stockmine M43 in a display case surrounded by other less lethal items]]
While blast mines are designed to cause severe injury to one person, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] mines (such as the World War II era German [[S-mine]]) are designed to project fragments across a wide area, causing fragmentation wounds to nearby personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2ykDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=popular+science+may+1941&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-5-VTLmSJMqmnQeu-5SxBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=popular%20science%20may%201941&amp;f=true "How Axis Mines Work"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1944, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Fragmentation mines are generally much larger and heavier than blast mines, and contain a large amount (often several kilograms) of ferrous metal. As such, they are easy to detect if the environment is not too heavily contaminated with iron.

=== Effect ===
These mines are deemed to be more efficient than purely "blast effect" mines, because the shrapnel covers a greater area, potentially injuring more combatants.

The shrapnel from these mines can even disable some armoured vehicles, by puncturing their tires and—in the case of soft-skinned vehicles—also penetrating the skin and damaging internal components or injuring personnel. Because fragmentation mines generally contain a much larger charge than blast mines, they can cause severe damage to an unarmoured vehicle which runs directly over one.

=== Types of fragmentation mine ===

==== Stake ====
These mines (such as the Russian [[POMZ]]) are entirely above ground, having a fragmenting warhead mounted on a stake at a suitable height, concealed by vegetation or rubbish and triggered by one or more [[tripwire]]s.

==== Bounding ====
Bounding mines have a small lifting charge that, when activated, launches the main body of the mine out of the ground before it detonates at around chest height. This produces a more lethal spray of shrapnel over a larger area. One such—the US [[M16 mine]]—can cause injuries up to {{convert|200|m|ft|-1}} away. The steel shrapnel makes bounding mines easy to detect, so they may be surrounded by minimum metal mines to make mine clearance harder.

==== Directional ====
Directional fragmentation weapons (such as the [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|M18 Claymore]]) differ from other types in that they are designed to direct their fragments only in a limited arc. They are placed so that the blast will be directed at the target area and away from friendly forces. This design also allows forces to protect themselves by placing these types of mines near their own positions, but facing the enemy. They are triggered in a conventional manner with either [[tripwire]] or command detonation. They are generally referred to as ''claymore mines'' from the US mine of this type.

== Improvised explosive devices ==
In the conflicts of the [[21st century]], anti-personnel [[improvised explosive devices]] ([[Improvised explosive device|IED]]) have replaced conventional or military [[landmines]] as the source of injury to dismounted ([[pedestrian]]) soldiers and civilians. These injuries were recently reported in [[BMJ Open]] to be far worse with [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]s than with [[landmines]] resulting in multiple limb [[amputation]]s and lower body mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Smith S et al.|date= 2017|title= Injury profile suffered by targets of antipersonnel improvised explosive devices: prospective cohort study|url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014697|journal= BMJ Open|volume= 7|issue= 7|page= e014697|doi= 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014697|pmc= 5691184|pmid= 28835410|access-date= 27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of injuries has been given the name "Dismounted Complex Blast Injury" and is thought to be the worst survivable injury ever seen in [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Cannon JW et al.|date= 2016|title= Dismounted Complex Blast Injuries: A Comprehensive Review of the Modern Combat Experience.|url= http://www.journalacs.org/article/S1072-7515(16)30689-5/fulltext|journal= J Am Coll Surg|volume= 223|issue= 4|pages= 652–664|doi= 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2016.07.009|pmc= |pmid= 27481095|access-date= 28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, flame mines known as the [[flame fougasse]] were produced by the British during the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|invasion crisis of 1940]]. Later, the Russians produced a flame-mine, called the FOG-1. This was copied by the Germans to produce the [[Abwehrflammenwerfer 42]], these devices were effectively disposable, trip-wire triggered [[flamethrower]]s.

Chemical mines have also been made. They were made by Britain, the US and the Soviet Union during World War II, but never deployed. During the Cold War, the US produced the [[M23 chemical mine]] containing [[VX (nerve agent)]]. A small explosive charge burst the mine open and dispersed the chemical when the mine was triggered.

== Patentability ==
Anti-personnel mines are a typical example of [[patentable subject matter|subject-matter excluded from patentability]] under the [[European Patent Convention]], because the publication or exploitation of such [[invention]]s are contrary to the "[[ordre public]]" &lt;!-- yes ordre, not order. See the wording of Art. 53(a) EPC --&gt;and/or [[morality]] ({{EPC Article|53|a}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|g|ii|4|1}}, "Matter contrary to "''ordre public''" or morality".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of name ==
The author Rob Nixon has criticized the use of the adjective "anti-personnel" to describe mines, noting that the word "personnel" signifies people engaged in a particular organization, whereas in reality "four-fifths of mine casualties are civilians", in particular children. Thus, he argues, the name "flatters their accuracy by implying that they target an organization, military or otherwise." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Nixon|first = Rob|title = Slow violence and the environmentalism of the poor|publisher = Harvard University Press|location = Cambridge, Mass|year = 2011|pages=222–223|isbn = 9780674049307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3349">The '''Babcock-Hart Award''' has been awarded since 1948 by the [[Institute of Food Technologists]]. It is given for significant contributions in [[food technology]] that resulted in [[public health]] through some aspects of [[nutrition]]. It was first named the Stephan M. Babcock Award after the [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[chemistry|chemist]] [[Stephen M. Babcock]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] for his "[[single-grain experiment]]" of 1907–1911, but renamed the Babcock-Hart Award following the death of Babcock's colleague [[Edwin B. Hart]] in 1953.

Award winners receive a plaque from the [[International Life Sciences Institute]]-[[North America]], headquartered in [[Washington, DC]] and a [[USD]] 3000 [[honorarium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2052">The '''BeoCenter 9500''' is an integrated home music system by [[Bang &amp; Olufsen]]. It consists of an AM/FM receiver, CD player and cassette recorder. Its award winning design features a mirrored exterior of polished aluminium and smoked glass. The BeoCenter 9500 has no buttons: it is controlled by touching the glass with one’s fingertip.
[[File:BeoCenter9500.JPG|thumb|BeoCenter9500]]

==History==
The BeoCenter 9500 was introduced in 1989 as the successor to the [[BeoCenter 9000]] and sold until 1994 when it was replaced by its successor the [[BeoCenter 9300]].

==Controls==
The BeoCenter 9500 featured B&amp;O's unique sensi-touch control which works through a condenser effect. A graphite area is printed on the underside of the glass panel, and charged with a high frequency current. The proximity of a finger will invoke the control. The controls are illuminated by LEDs.  Only the controls which have a function to the current activity are lit up.
The CD and cassette are hidden behind polished aluminium lids. A light touch on the display panel makes the lids glide to the side giving immediate access to disc or cassette.

==Award==
Its designer [[David Lewis (designer) | David Lewis]] was awarded the [[iF product design award]] in 1990 for the BeoCenter 9500
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifdesign.de/beitragsdetails_e.html?offset=2&amp;sprache=1&amp;award_id=73&amp;beitrag_id=14495/ iF Design Award]&lt;/ref&gt; although the original design (the BeoCenter 9000) was penned by his predecessor [[Jacob Jensen]].

[[File:Camera stabilizer used in a low-angle shot.ogv|thumb|An operator uses a camera stabilizer in a [[low-angle shot]]]]

A '''camera stabilizer''', or '''camera–stabilizing mount''', is a device designed to hold a [[camera]] in a manner that prevents or compensates for unwanted camera movement, such as "[[camera shake]]".

For small [[hand-held camera]]s, a harness or contoured frame steadies the camera against the photographer's body. In some models, the camera mount is on an arm that protrudes in front of the photographer; beneath the camera is a handle grip. Another variation positions the camera atop a fulcrum braced against the photographer's chest or abdomen.

To compensate for camera instability caused by the movement of the operator's body, [[camera operator]] [[Garrett Brown]] invented the [[Steadicam]], a body-mounted stabilization apparatus for [[motion picture camera]]s, which uses [[Spring (device)|springs]] as [[shock absorber]]s.

In 1991, Martin Philip Stevens (born in England in 1963) invented a hand-held camera stabilizer for motion-picture and video cameras, called the ''Glidecam''. 

Some camera stabilization machines use [[gyroscope]]s to sense disruptive motion.  The Artemis Trinity system from [[Arri]] combines a mechanical and electronic stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdtimes.com/2016/05/02/arri-artemis-trinity-stabilizergimbal-video/|title=ARRI Artemis Trinity Stabilizer/Gimbal Video|publisher=Film and Digital Times|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nofilmschool.com/2016/04/arri-artemis-trinity|title=Is the ARRI Artemis Trinity the World's Most Advanced Camera Stabilizer?|publisher=No Film School|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2016/05/arri-debuts-final-version-of-trinity-stabilizer-and-maxima-gimbal/|title=ARRI Debuts Final Version of Trinity Stabilizer and Maxima Gimbal|publisher=Studio Daily|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a [[tripod]] can hold a camera stably, stationary platforms are not regarded as camera stabilizers.

==Camera shoulder brace==
A camera shoulder brace stabilizes by shifting the weight of the camera to the operator's shoulder. This allows for smoother shots than might be obtainable by handheld operation. Camera shoulder braces are typically padded for comfort and allow the attachment of zoom controllers, transmitters, and other devices.

The operator generally holds two handles while a third brace rests on the shoulder. A remote [[LANC]] zoom controller is usually placed on one of the handles.

Most braces are made of [[PVC]], [[carbon fiber]] or light-weight metals to keep the weight down.  If the brace were too heavy it would defeat the purpose of using it, reduced camera shake and fluidity of movement.

For low shots, most braces can be used as a mini-[[tripod]] by setting the brace on flat surface.

Shoulder braces also reduce stress on the arms which reduces tiredness and muscle cramps during filming.

Consequently, two different versions of the method have been proposed: one by Elnagar et al.,&lt;ref name="EK1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elnagar | first1 = G. | last2 = Kazemi | first2 = M. A. | year = 1998 | title = Pseudospectral Chebyshev Optimal Control of Constrained Nonlinear Dynamical Systems | url = | journal = Computational Optimization and Applications | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 195–217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another by Fahroo and Ross.&lt;ref name="FR1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahroo | first1 = F. | last2 = Ross | first2 = I.

The [[Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral method|Fahroo–Ross method]] is more commonly used today due to the ease in implementation of the [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]] technique (in contrast to Elnagar–Kazemi's cell-averaging method). In 2008, Trefethen showed that the Clenshaw–Curtis method was nearly as accurate as [[Gauss quadrature]].
&lt;ref name ="LNT1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trefethen | first1 = Lloyd N. | authorlink = Lloyd N.

==Other Chebyshev methods==
The Chebyshev PS method is frequently confused with other Chebyshev methods.  Prior to the advent of PS methods, many authors&lt;ref name="VD"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vlassenbroeck | first1 = J. | last2 = Dooren | first2 = R.

A '''cinetheodolite''' (a.k.a. ''kinetheodolite'') is a photographic instrument for collection of [[trajectory]] data. It can be used to acquire data in the testing of [[missile]]s, [[rocket]]s, [[projectile]]s, [[aircraft]], and [[fire control system]]s; in the [[ripple fire|ripple firing]] of rockets, graze action tests, [[air burst]] [[fuze]] tests, and similar operations. Cinetheodolites provide angular measurements of the line of sight to the vehicle. This permits acquiring accurate position data. Together with timing systems, velocity and acceleration data can be developed from the position measurements. Cinetheodolites can serve as primary sources of position and velocity data to about 30&amp;nbsp;km [[slant range]].

These instruments were developed from a family of optical devices known as [[theodolite]]s by the addition of a [[movie camera]], thus adding the ability to track the vehicle in flight and to obtain continuous trajectory data.

==Introduction==
One of the objectives of testing missile and rocket systems is to determine the actual "in-flight" performance of the vehicles themselves. One of the prime requirements for establishing the performance of vehicles in flight is to obtain accurate data which will reveal the position in space and the attitude of the vehicle during its trajectory. The employment of optics at a missile range may become highly significant in obtaining these data, if the atmosphere permits reasonably unobstructed observation, and if, moreover, an all-land test area makes possible optimum siting of instruments for most desirable look angles. Under these conditions, optics in general, and [[photogrammetry]] in particular, correlated with other instrumentation systems, can provide effective and accurate data of target trajectory.

==Description==
The cinetheodolite is a combination photo-recording and surveying instrument which tracks and photographs targets (in flight vehicles, etc.) at selectable [[frame rate]]s. Some cinetheodolites have rate-aided tracking control, whereby an open loop [[servomechanism]] in conjunction with operator actuated hand wheels match the angular rates of the tracking axis with the angular rates of the target line of position.

Cinetheodolites consist of a stable base and bearing, a vertical [[gimbal]] or [[trunnion]] carrier which rotates about a vertical axis normal to the plane of the base; a central drum or housing which contains the system telescopic lenses, plus a camera and film assembly; a horizontal trunnion shaft on which the central drum is mounted so that it can rise or dip about the horizontal
axis; and the sighting [[telescope]]s, which are also mounted on the horizontal trunnion shaft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8100">'''Ecash''' was conceived by [[David Chaum]] as an anonymous cryptographic [[electronic money]] or electronic cash system in 1982. It was realized through his corporation [[Digicash]] and used as [[micropayment]] system at one US bank from 1995 to 1998.

==Design==
Chaum published the idea of anonymous electronic money in a 1982 paper;&lt;ref name=chaum83&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaum|first1=David|title=Blind signatures for untraceable payments|journal=Advances in Cryptology Proceedings|date=1983|volume=82|issue=3|pages=199–203|url=http://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; eCash software on the user's local computer stored money in a digital format, cryptographically signed by a bank. The user could spend the digital money at any shop accepting eCash, without having to open an account with the vendor first, or transmitting credit card numbers. Security was ensured by public key digital signature schemes.  The [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[blind signature]]s achieved unlinkability between withdrawal and spend transactions. Depending on the payment transactions, one distinguishes between on-line and off-line electronic cash: If the payee has to contact a third party (e.g., the bank or the credit-card company acting as an acquirer) before accepting a payment, the system is called an on-line system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Berry Schoenmakers|editor1-last=Preneel|editor1-first=B.|editor2-last=Rijmen|editor2-first=V.|title=Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography: State of the Art and Evolution|date=1998|chapter-url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~berry/papers/cosic.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2014|chapter=Basic security of the ecash payment system}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Chaum together with [[Moni Naor]] proposed the first off-line e-cash system, which was also based on blind signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://blog.koehntopp.de/uploads/chaum_fiat_naor_ecash.pdf |author1=Chaum, D. |author2=Fiat, A. |author3=Naor, M. |year=1990 |title=Untraceable electronic cash |book-title=Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO '88 Proceedings |editor=S. Goldwasser |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |pages=319-327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chaum started the company [[DigiCash]] in 1990 with "ecash" as its trademark. He raised $10 million from [[David Marquardt]] and by 1997 [[Nicholas Negroponte]] was its chairman.&lt;ref name=Forbes99/&gt; Yet, in the United States, only one bank -the Mark Twain bank in Saint Louis,MO- implemented ecash, testing it as micropayment system;&lt;ref name=Cnet&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-215150.html|title= DigiCash loses U.S. toehold|author=Tim Clark|work=Cnet|date=2 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to credit cards, the system was free to purchasers, while merchants paid a transaction fee. After a three-year trial that signed up merely 5,000 customers, the system was dissolved in 1998, one year after the bank had been purchased by [[Mercantile Bank]], a large issuer of credit cards.&lt;ref name=Cnet/&gt; David Chaum opined then “As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped. It was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them”.&lt;ref name=Forbes99/&gt;

In Europe, with fewer credit cards and more cash transactions, micropayment technologies made more sense.&lt;ref name=Cnet/&gt; In June 1998, ecash became available through [[Credit Suisse]] in Switzerland, was available from [[Deutsche Bank]] in Germany, [[Bank Austria]], Sweden's [[Posten AB]], and [[Den norske Bank]] of Norway, while in Japan Nomura Research Institute marketed eCash to financial institutions.&lt;ref name=Cnet/&gt;
In Australia, ecash was implemented by [[St.George Bank]] and Advance Bank, but transactions were not free to purchasers.&lt;ref name=Forbes99/&gt;  In Finland [[Nordea|Merita Bank]]/[[EUnet]] made ecash available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998, despite flourishing electronic commerce, but with credit cards as the "currency of choice".&lt;ref name=Forbes99&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411390a.html|author= Pitta, Julie|date=1 November 1999|title= Requiem for a Bright Idea|work= Forbes|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DigiCash was sold to eCash Technologies, including its eCash patents.

In 2000 eCash Technologies sued eCash.com, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. eCash.com counterclaimed that eCash Technologies' trademark registration was fraudulently obtained, because it failed to disclose eCash.com's registration of the "ecash.com" domain name to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eCash Technologies, Inc. v. Guagliardo d/b/a Ecash.com,Netconcept Interactive, Netconcept, &amp; Netconcept Inc., Defendants &amp; Counterclaimants. 127 F.Supp.2d 1069 (C.D. Cal. 2000)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9304324102484286241&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=1000006|author1=United States District Court |author2=C.D. California |date=30 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected eCash.com's counterclaim saying a trademark applicant must disclose a third party's rights only if they are "clearly established." The court argued because the "mere registration of a domain name does not confer trademark rights, let alone "clearly established" rights, ECash Technologies had no duty to disclose defendant's registration of the “ecash.com” domain name to the PTO, however eCash Technologies subsequently went bankrupt and the domain "Ecash.com" remained in possession of the original owner.

In 2002 eCash Technologies was acquired by [[InfoSpace]],&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steve Bills|title=In Brief: InfoSpace Buys eCash Technologies|url=http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/167_41/-169001-1.html|publisher=American Banker|accessdate=30 October 2014|date=1 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently known as [[Blucora]].

The '''Echo II''' was a plug-in expansion card, speech synthesizer card for the [[Apple II]] and [[Apple IIe]] personal computers that allowed applications to use speech synthesis. The Echo II used the [[TMS5220]] speech synthesis chip to synthesize speech. The Echo II software could synthesize either unlimited text-to-speech using stitched phonemes, or play back raw LPC data for specific words, with resulting higher speech quality.

LPC ([[linear predictive coding]]) was the speech synthesis technology used, which allowed applications to encode speech data in a compact form. The Echo II used the [[Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips|TMS 5220 LPC Speech Chip]] which was popular in other [[speech synthesizers]]

The '''end of train device''' ('''ETD'''), sometimes referred to as an '''EOT''', '''flashing rear-end device''' ('''FRED''') or '''sense and braking unit''' ('''SBU''') is an electronic device mounted on the end of [[Freight rail transport|freight trains]] in lieu of a [[caboose]]. They are divided into three categories: "dumb" units, which only provide a visible indication of the rear of the train with a flashing red taillight; "average intelligence" units with a brake pipe pressure gauge; and "smart" units, which send back data to the crew in the [[locomotive]] via radio-based [[telemetry]].&lt;ref name="trainsmag" /&gt; They originated in North America, and are also used elsewhere in the world, where they may include complete End of Train Air System (ETAS) or Sense and Brake Unit (SBU) devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://railgallery.wongm.com/etm-devices/ |title=Wongm's Rail Gallery - ETM devices |website=RailGallery.Wongm.com |accessdate=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vicsig.net/index.php?page=infrastructure&amp;section=safeworking#saw |title=VICSIG - Infrastructure - Safeworking in Victoria |website=VicSig.net |accessdate=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design and use ==
A "dumb" ETD can be as simple as a red flag attached to the coupler on the last car of the train, whereas "smart" devices monitor functions such as [[Railway air brake|brake line]] pressure and accidental separation of the train using a motion sensor, functions that were previously monitored by a crew in the caboose.&lt;ref name="trainsmag"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=220 |magazine=[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]] |first=Robert S. |last=McGonigal |date=May 1, 2006 |title=End-of-Train Devices |publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]] |accessdate=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ETD transmits data via a [[telemetry]] link to the Head-of-Train Device (HTD) in the locomotive, known colloquially among railroaders as a "Wilma," a play on the first name of the wife of cartoon character [[Fred Flintstone]]. In Canada, this device is known as a sense and braking unit (SBU).

A typical HTD contains several lights indicating telemetry status and rear end movement, along with a digital readout of the brake line pressure from the ETD. It also contains a toggle switch used to initiate an emergency brake application from the rear end. In modern locomotives, the HTD is built into the locomotive's computer system, and the information is displayed on the engineer's computer screen.

Railroads have strict government-approved air brake testing procedures for various circumstances when assembling trains or switching out cars en route. After a cut is made between cars in a train and the train is rejoined, in addition to other tests, the crew must verify that the brakes apply and release on the rear car (to ensure that all of the brake hoses are connected and the angle cocks, or valves, are opened). In most cases, the engineer is able to use information from the ETD to verify that the air pressure reduces and increases at the rear of the train accordingly, indicating proper brake pipe continuity.  This device is said to constitute a [[fail-safe]] condition.

[[File:Lookout on back of train that is backing up.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Because there is no caboose, the employee must stand on the last car of this [[Union Pacific]] train going in reverse, to make sure the track is clear — something the ETD doesn't currently do.]]

The ETD reduced labor costs, as well as the costs of the purchase and upkeep of cabooses.  The Brotherhood of Conductors, and [[Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen|Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen]] were also greatly affected by ETD, as this electronic unit replaced two crewmen per train. The widespread use of ETD's has made the caboose nearly obsolete. Some roads still use cabooses where the train must be backed up, on short local runs,&lt;ref name="trainsmag" /&gt;  as rolling offices, or [[railroad police]] stations and as transportation for [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] maintenance crews. In some cases (see photo) instead of hitching a caboose, an employee stands on the last car when the train is backing up.

== Evolution ==

The first ETD use is attributed to [[Florida East Coast Railway]] in 1969, soon after which other [[Class I railroad]]s began using ETD's as well. By the  mid-1980s they were common equipment.&lt;ref name="trainsmag" /&gt;  Early models were little more than a brake line connection&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;termination, a battery and flashing tail light.  As their use became more widespread through the 1980s, ETD's were equipped with radio telemetry transmitters to send brake pressure data to a receiver in the locomotive.  To reduce the cost of battery replacements, ambient light sensors were added so the flashing light on the ETD would illuminate only during dusk and after dark.  Later models have a small turbine-powered electrical generator using air pressure from the brake line to power the ETD's radio and sensors.

The one-way communication of brake data from the ETD to the locomotive evolved into two-way communication that enables the engineer to apply the brakes from both ends of the train simultaneously in an emergency.&lt;ref name="trainsmag" /&gt; This is useful in the event that a blockage (or an unopened valve) in the train's brake line is preventing dumping the air pressure and causing all of the brakes in the train going into an emergency application. Such a situation could be dangerous, as stopping distance increases with fewer functioning brakes. Dumping the brake line pressure from both the front and rear of the train simultaneously ensures that the entire train applies all of its brakes in emergency. Other electronics within the ETD were also enhanced, and many now include [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers as well as the two-way radio communications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3073">The '''European transonic wind tunnel''' (ETW) is a high-Reynolds-number transonic wind tunnel using [[nitrogen]] as test gas.

It is one of the world's largest cryogenic wind tunnels. It is situated in [[Cologne]], Germany. ETW was constructed and is operated by the four European countries [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Great Britain]] and The Netherlands. The ETW is in operation since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eswirp.eu/Facility-ETW.html eswirp.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

ETW provides real-flight Reynolds numbers by virtue of both increased pressure and decreased temperature. Independent variation of [[Reynolds number]] and aero elastic loading can be done there. They specialize in Flight Reynolds number testing for full-span and semi-span models at cruise conditions and extreme borders of [[flight envelope]].

==Tunnel parameters==
The tunnel parameters are as follows:
*Test Section: 2.4 m x 2.0 m ; length 9 m
*Mach Number Range: 0.15 - 1.3 
*Pressure Range: 1.25 - 4.5 bar
*Temperature Range: 110 - 313 K 
*Max. Reynolds number:  50 million per m

Optical access to the test section for various cameras and light sources is provided through 90 special windows in all walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etw.de/ etw.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wind tunnel circuit==
ETW has a closed aerodynamic circuit contained inside an internally insulated stainless steel pressure shell. The compressor with a drive power of up to 50 MW circulates the nitrogen gas around the circuit. To achieve the desired low temperature of the gas flow and to compensate for the heat input caused by viscous friction in the flow, liquid nitrogen with a temperature of minus 196°C is continuously injected into the tunnel flow through four rakes with some 270 [[spray nozzles]] in the short leg of the circuit upstream of the compressor. This liquid nitrogen vaporizes immediately and thus forms the cold gas flow. The corresponding gaseous nitrogen exhaust is located in the other short leg of the circuit upstream of the stilling chamber and is controlled by valves to maintain constant pressure inside the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etw.de/ etw.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

===test section===
Test section details:
*Dimensions (HxWxL): 2.00m x 2.40 m x  9.00 m (incl. re-entry).
*Wall Configuration: 
:Top and bottom walls : 6 slots each,  with 6.25% [[porosity]], wall angle remotely adjustable 
:Side walls : 4 slots each, with 7.4% porosity 
*Re-entry area : provided by movable finger flaps (one per slot)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etw.de/cms/uploads/pdfs/ETW_UserGuide.pdf etw.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

An exchangeable model cart system is present to increase the productivity.

==Tunnel instrumentation==
The instrumentation facilities include flange type strain gauge balances, servoaccelerometer inclinometer, Kulite measurement system, Deformation Measurement System, [[thermochromism|Temperature Sensitive Paint System]] and mini tufts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eswirp.eu/PDF/WP2.4_ETW_datasheet.pdf eswirp.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">{{advert|date=July 2017}}'''Fire glass''' is [[Toughened glass|tempered glass]] manufactured as a medium to retain and direct heat in [[fireplace]]s and gas [[fire pit]]s. Fire glass does not burn, but retains heat and refracts light as a result of burning gas. Fire glass, like artificial logs and stones, is additionally used to obscure the gas plumbing inherent in gas fireplaces or stoves.

==Manufacturing process==

A vast asortment of fire glass shapes, sizes and colors are available to match a wide variety of contemporary décors. During the manufacturing process, sheets of glass are tempered to withstand heat. This process prevents the glass from "popping" when used in a fire and negates the threat of sparking seen in traditional wood burning fireplaces or fire features. These tempered sheets of glass are then shattered. and professionally packaged. Although a variety of fire glass types exist, variations are purily aesthetic, and all varieties serve the same purpose within a fire feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-fire-glass.htm|title=What is Fire Glass?

==Environmental effects==

Fire glass leaves no trace of ash, soot, grease or discernible odor when used as a medium. Flames produced using natural gas do not produce any smoke, produce less toxic gases and leave no trace of residual pollutants such as tar within the home. The combination is considered an eco-friendly burning solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Littman|first=Margaret|title=Light your fire the eco-friendly way|url=http://illinoistimes.com/article-9112-light-your-fire-the-eco-friendly-way.html|date=22 September 2011|access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, fire glass is often made from recycled glass, making for a "green" fire media option.

==Additional uses==

In addition to being used as a fire pit and fireplace media, fire glass is often used as a crafting item (e.g. in a wedding centerpiece).

A '''fluorescent lamp''', or '''fluorescent tube''', is a low-pressure [[mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-vapor]] [[gas-discharge lamp]] that uses [[fluorescence]] to produce visible light. An [[electrical conduction in gases|electric current]] in the gas [[excited state|excites]] [[mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor, which produces short-wave [[ultraviolet]] light that then causes a [[phosphor]] coating on the inside of the lamp to [[fluorescence|glow]]. A fluorescent lamp converts electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than [[incandescent light bulb|incandescent lamps]]. The typical [[luminous efficacy]] of fluorescent lighting systems is 50–100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.

Fluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than incandescent lamps because they require a [[electrical ballast|ballast]] to regulate the [[Electric current|current]] through the lamp, but the lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost. [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s are now available in the same popular sizes as incandescents and are used as an [[energy-saving]] alternative in homes.

Because they contain mercury, many fluorescent lamps are classified as [[hazardous waste]]. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] recommends that fluorescent lamps be segregated from general waste for [[recycling]] or safe disposal, and some jurisdictions require recycling of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/waste/hazard/wastetypes/universal/lamps/index.htm Mercury-Containing Light Bulb (Lamp) Recycling | Universal Waste | US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Physical discoveries===
Fluorescence of certain rocks and other substances had been observed for hundreds of years before its nature was understood. By the middle of the 19th century, experimenters had observed a radiant glow emanating from partially evacuated glass vessels through which an [[electric current]] passed. One of the first to explain it was the Irish scientist [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|Sir George Stokes]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1852, who named the phenomenon "fluorescence" after [[fluorite]], a mineral many of whose samples glow strongly because of impurities. The explanation relied on the nature of electricity and light phenomena as developed by the British scientists [[Michael Faraday]] in the 1840s and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Gribben, John; "The Scientists; A History of Science Told Through the Lives of Its Greatest Inventors"; [[Random House]]; 2004; pp 424–432; {{ISBN|978-0-8129-6788-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little more was done with this phenomenon until 1856 when German glassblower [[Heinrich Geissler]] created a [[mercury vacuum pump]] that evacuated a glass tube to an extent not previously possible.  Geissler invented the first gas-discharge lamp, the [[Geissler tube]], consisting of a partially evacuated glass tube with a metal [[electrode]] at either end.  When a high voltage was applied between the electrodes, the inside of the tube lit up with a [[glow discharge]].  By putting different chemicals inside, the tubes could be made to produce a variety of colors, and elaborate Geissler tubes were sold for entertainment. More important, however, was its contribution to scientific research. One of the first scientists to experiment with a Geissler tube was [[Julius Plücker]] who systematically described in 1858 the luminescent effects that occurred in a Geissler tube. He also made the important observation that the glow in the tube shifted position when in proximity to an [[electromagnetic field]]. [[Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] observed in 1859 that certain substances gave off light when they were placed in a Geissler tube. He went on to apply thin coatings of luminescent materials to the surfaces of these tubes. Fluorescence occurred, but the tubes were very inefficient and had a short operating life.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Bright|1949|pp=381–385}} for discussion of early history&lt;/ref&gt;

Inquiries that began with the Geissler tube continued as even better vacuums were produced. The most famous was the evacuated tube used for scientific research by [[William Crookes]]. That tube was evacuated by the highly effective mercury [[vacuum pump]] created by [[Hermann Sprengel]]. Research conducted by Crookes and others ultimately led to the discovery of the [[electron]] in 1897 by [[J. J. Thomson]] and [[X-rays]] in 1895 by [[Wilhelm Roentgen]]. But the [[Crookes tube]], as it came to be known, produced little light because the vacuum in it was too good and thus lacked the trace amounts of gas that are needed for electrically stimulated [[luminescence]].

===Early discharge lamps===
[[Image:Early Cooper Hewitt mercury vapor lamp.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the first [[mercury vapor lamp]]s invented by [[Peter Cooper Hewitt]], 1903.  It was similar to a fluorescent lamp without the fluorescent coating on the tube, and produced greenish light.  The round device under the lamp is the [[ballast (electrical)|ballast]]. ]]

While Becquerel was interested primarily in conducting scientific research into fluorescence, [[Thomas Edison]] briefly pursued fluorescent lighting for its commercial potential. He invented a fluorescent lamp in 1896 that used a coating of [[calcium]] tungstate as the fluorescing substance, excited by [[X-rays]], but although it received a patent in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|865367}} ''Fluorescent Electric Lamp''&lt;/ref&gt; it was not put into production. As with a few other attempts to use Geissler tubes for illumination, it had a short operating life, and given the success of the incandescent light, Edison had little reason to pursue an alternative means of electrical illumination. [[Nikola Tesla]] made similar experiments in the 1890s, devising high-frequency powered fluorescent bulbs that gave a bright greenish light, but as with Edison's devices, no commercial success was achieved.

Although Edison had lost interest in fluorescent lighting, one of his former employees was able to create a gas-based lamp that achieved a measure of commercial success. In 1895 [[Daniel McFarlan Moore]] demonstrated lamps {{convert|2|to|3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length that used [[carbon dioxide]] or [[nitrogen]] to emit white or pink light, respectively. As with future fluorescent lamps, they were considerably more complicated than an incandescent bulb.&lt;ref name=etheric&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Moore's Etheric Light. The Young Newark Electrician's New And Successful Device. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1896/10/02/archives/mr-moores-etheric-light-the-young-newark-electricians-new-and.html |publisher=New York Times |date=October 2, 1896|accessdate=2008-05-26 }} Paid access.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Cooper Hewitt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Cooper Hewitt]]]]
After years of work, Moore was able to extend the operating life of the lamps by inventing an electromagnetically controlled valve that maintained a constant gas pressure within the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern illuminants and illuminating engineering |last1=Gaster |first1=Leon |last2=Dow |first2=John Stewart |date=1915 |publisher=Whittaker &amp; Co. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVVDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |pages=107–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Moore’s lamp was complicated, was expensive to install, and required very high voltages, it was considerably more efficient than incandescent lamps, and it produced a closer approximation to natural daylight than contemporary incandescent lamps. From 1904 onwards Moore’s lighting system was installed in a number of stores and offices.&lt;ref name=Bright&gt;{{cite book |title=The Electric-Lamp Industry |date=1949 |last=Bright |first=Arthur A., Jr. |publisher=MacMillan |ref=harv}} Pages 221–223 describe Moore tubes. Pages 369–374 describe neon tube lighting. Page 385 discusses Risler's contributions to fluorescent coatings in the 1920s. Pages 388–391 discuss the development of the commercial fluorescent at General Electric in the 1930s.&lt;/ref&gt; Its success contributed to [[General Electric]]’s motivation to improve the incandescent lamp, especially its filament. GE’s efforts came to fruition with the invention of a [[tungsten]]-based filament. The extended lifespan and improved efficacy of incandescent bulbs negated one of the key advantages of Moore’s lamp, but GE purchased the relevant patents in 1912. These patents and the inventive efforts that supported them were to be of considerable value when the firm took up fluorescent lighting more than two decades later.

At about the same time that Moore was developing his lighting system, another American was creating a means of illumination that also can be seen as a precursor to the modern fluorescent lamp. This was the [[mercury-vapor lamp]], invented by [[Peter Cooper Hewitt]] and patented in 1901 ({{patent|US|682692}}; this patent number is frequently misquoted as US 889,692). Hewitt’s lamp glowed when an electric current was passed through mercury vapor at a low pressure. Unlike Moore’s lamps, Hewitt's were manufactured in standardized sizes and operated at low [[voltages]]. The mercury-vapor lamp was superior to the incandescent lamps of the time in terms of energy efficiency, but the blue-green light it produced limited its applications. It was, however, used for photography and some industrial processes.

Mercury vapor lamps continued to be developed at a slow pace, especially in Europe, and by the early 1930s they received limited use for large-scale illumination. Some of them employed fluorescent coatings, but these were used primarily for color correction and not for enhanced light output. Mercury vapor lamps also anticipated the fluorescent lamp in their incorporation of a ballast to maintain a constant current.

Cooper-Hewitt had not been the first to use mercury vapor for illumination, as earlier efforts had been mounted by Way, Rapieff, Arons, and Bastian and Salisbury. Of particular importance was the mercury vapor lamp invented by Küch in [[Germany]]. This lamp used quartz in place of glass to allow higher [[operating temperature]]s, and hence greater efficiency. Although its light output relative to electrical consumption was better than that of other sources of light, the light it produced was similar to that of the Cooper-Hewitt lamp in that it lacked the red portion of the spectrum, making it unsuitable for ordinary lighting.

===Neon lamps===
{{main|Neon lighting}}
The next step in gas-based lighting took advantage of the luminescent qualities of [[neon]], an inert gas that had been discovered in 1898 by isolation from the atmosphere. Neon glowed a brilliant red when used in Geissler tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Discovery of the Elements: Third Edition (reprint) |last=Weeks |first=Mary Elvira |authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks|date=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJIk9BPdNWcC&amp;pg=PA287 |page=287 |isbn=978-0-7661-3872-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, [[Georges Claude]], a Frenchman who had developed a technology and a successful business for air liquefaction, was obtaining enough neon as a byproduct to support a neon lighting industry.&lt;ref name=Claude1913&gt;{{cite journal |last=Claude |first=Georges |title=The Development of Neon Tubes |journal=The Engineering Magazine |date=November 1913 |pages=271–274 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA271#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanDulken&gt;{{cite book |title=Inventing the 20th century: 100 inventions that shaped the world : from the airplane to the zipper |last1=van Dulken |first1=Stephen |page=42 |publisher=New York University Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-8147-8812-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVHRRoQvW60C&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt; While neon lighting was used around 1930 in France for general illumination, it was no more energy-efficient than conventional incandescent lighting. Neon tube lighting, which also includes the use of argon and mercury vapor as alternative gases, came to be used primarily for eye-catching signs and advertisements. Neon lighting was relevant to the development of fluorescent lighting, however, as Claude’s improved electrode (patented in 1915) overcame "sputtering", a major source of electrode degradation. Sputtering occurred when ionized particles struck an electrode and tore off bits of metal. Although Claude’s invention required [[electrodes]] with a lot of surface area, it showed that a major impediment to gas-based lighting could be overcome.

The development of the neon light also was significant for the last key element of the fluorescent lamp, its fluorescent coating. In 1926 Jacques Risler received a French patent for the application of fluorescent coatings to neon light tubes.&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt; The main use of these lamps, which can be considered the first commercially successful fluorescents, was for advertising, not general illumination. This, however, was not the first use of fluorescent coatings; Becquerel had earlier used the idea and Edison used calcium tungstate for his unsuccessful lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XcRPQcc0vU0C&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=Becquerel+%22Fluorescent+Lamp%22+Coating#v=onepage&amp;q=Becquerel%20%22Fluorescent%20Lamp%22%20Coating&amp;f=false |title=Building Systems for Interior Designers – Corky Binggeli – Google Books |accessdate=2016-06-05|isbn=9780470228470 |last1=Binggeli |first1=Corky |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0i-SmPtmJDIC&amp;pg=PT163&amp;dq=Becquerel+%22Fluorescent+Coating%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Becquerel%20%22Fluorescent%20Coating%22&amp;f=false |title=Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood – Oliver Sacks – Google Books |date= 2011-06-16|accessdate=2016-06-05|isbn=9780330537216 |last1=Sacks |first1=Oliver }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.org/lighting/history/timeline-of-lighting.cfm |title=Discover Lighting! History &gt; Milestones in Lighting |publisher=Ies.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts had been mounted, but all were plagued by low efficiency and various technical problems. Of particular importance was the invention in 1927 of a low-voltage “metal vapor lamp” by Friedrich Meyer, Hans-Joachim Spanner, and [[Edmund Germer]], who were employees of a German firm in [[Berlin]]. A German patent was granted but the lamp never went into commercial production.

===Commercialization of fluorescent lamps===
All the major features of fluorescent lighting were in place at the end of the 1920s. Decades of invention and development had provided the key components of fluorescent lamps: economically manufactured glass tubing, inert gases for filling the tubes, electrical ballasts, long-lasting electrodes, mercury vapor as a source of luminescence, effective means of producing a reliable electrical discharge, and fluorescent coatings that could be energized by ultraviolet light. At this point, intensive development was more important than basic research.

In 1934, [[Arthur Compton]], a renowned physicist and GE consultant, reported to the GE lamp department on successful experiments with fluorescent lighting at [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Co., Ltd.]] in Great Britain (unrelated to General Electric in the United States). Stimulated by this report, and with all of the key elements available, a team led by George E. Inman built a prototype fluorescent lamp in 1934 at [[General Electric]]’s [[Nela Park]] (Ohio) engineering laboratory. This was not a trivial exercise; as noted by Arthur A. Bright, "A great deal of experimentation had to be done on lamp sizes and shapes, cathode construction, gas pressures of both argon and mercury vapor, colors of fluorescent powders, methods of attaching them to the inside of the tube, and other details of the lamp and its auxiliaries before the new device was ready for the public."&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt;

In addition to having engineers and technicians along with facilities for R&amp;D work on fluorescent lamps, General Electric controlled what it regarded as the key patents covering fluorescent lighting, including the patents originally issued to Hewitt, Moore, and Küch. More important than these was a patent covering an [[electrode]] that did not disintegrate at the gas pressures that ultimately were employed in fluorescent lamps. Albert W. Hull of GE’s Schenectady Research Laboratory filed for a patent on this invention in 1927, which was issued in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref patent| country=US |number=1790153 |status=patent |title=Electrical Discharge Device and Method of Operation |gdate=1931-01-27 |fdate=1927-10-15 |invent1=Albert W. Hull |invent2= |assign1=General Electric Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; General Electric used its control of the patents to prevent competition with its incandescent lights and probably delayed the introduction of fluorescent lighting by 20 years. Eventually, war production required 24-hour factories with economical lighting and fluorescent lights became available.

While the Hull patent gave GE a basis for claiming [[legal]] rights over the fluorescent lamp, a few months after the lamp went into production the firm learned of a U.S. patent application that had been filed in 1927 for the aforementioned "metal vapor lamp" invented in Germany by Meyer, Spanner, and Germer. The patent application indicated that the lamp had been created as a superior means of producing ultraviolet light, but the application also contained a few statements referring to fluorescent illumination. Efforts to obtain a U.S. patent had met with numerous delays, but were it to be granted, the patent might have caused serious difficulties for GE. At first, GE sought to block the issuance of a patent by claiming that priority should go to one of their employees, Leroy J. Buttolph, who according to their claim had invented a fluorescent lamp in 1919 and whose patent application was still pending. GE also had filed a patent application in 1936 in Inman’s name to cover the “improvements” wrought by his group. In 1939 GE decided that the claim of Meyer, Spanner, and Germer had some merit, and that in any event a long interference procedure was not in their best interest. They therefore dropped the Buttolph claim and paid $180,000 to acquire the Meyer, et al. application, which at that point was owned by a firm known as Electrons, Inc. The patent was duly awarded in December 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref patent| country=US |number=2182732 |status=patent |title=Metal Vapor Lamp |gdate=1939-12-05 |fdate=1927-12-19  |invent1=Friedrich Meyer |invent2=Hans-Joachim Spanner |invent3=Edmund Germer |assign1=General Electric Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This patent, along with the Hull patent, put GE on what seemed to be firm legal ground, although it faced years of legal challenges from [[Sylvania Electric Products]], Inc., which claimed [[Patent infringement|infringement]] on patents that it held.

Even though the patent issue was not completely resolved for many years, General Electric’s strength in manufacturing and marketing gave it a pre-eminent position in the emerging fluorescent light market. Sales of "fluorescent lumiline lamps" commenced in 1938 when four different sizes of tubes were put on the market. They were used in fixtures manufactured by three leading corporations, [[Lightolier]], [[Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation]], and Globe Lighting.  The Slimline fluorescent ballast's public
introduction in 1946 was by Westinghouse and General Electric and Showcase/Display Case fixtures were introduced by [[Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Electrical Consultant, Volume 50, Page 4, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse Engineer, Volume 12–13, Page 141, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;  During the following year, GE and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] publicized the new lights through exhibitions at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World’s Fair]] and the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco. Fluorescent lighting systems spread rapidly during World War II as wartime manufacturing intensified lighting demand. By 1951 more light was produced in the United States by fluorescent lamps than by incandescent lamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/20thcent/prec20.htm Lighting A Revolution: 20th Century Store-room&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first years [[zinc orthosilicate]] with varying content of [[beryllium]] was used as greenish phosphor. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum yielding acceptable white. After it was discovered that [[Berylliosis|beryllium was toxic]], halophosphate based phosphors took over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=A Review of Early Inorganic Phosphors |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klE5qGAltjAC&amp;pg=PA98 |page=98 |title=Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress |isbn=978-0-88173-378-5 |last1=Kane |first1=Raymond |last2=Sell |first2=Heinz |date=2001 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of operation==
The fundamental means for conversion of electrical energy into radiant energy in a fluorescent lamp relies on [[inelastic scattering]] of electrons when an incident electron collides with an atom in the mercury gas. If the (incident) free electron has enough [[kinetic energy]], it transfers energy to the atom's outer electron, causing that electron to temporarily jump up to a higher [[energy level]]. The collision is 'inelastic' because a loss of kinetic energy occurs.

This higher energy state is unstable, and the atom will emit an ultraviolet [[photon]] as the atom's electron reverts to a lower, more stable, energy level. Most of the photons that are released from the mercury atoms have [[wavelength]]s in the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) region of the spectrum, predominantly at wavelengths of 253.7 and 185 [[nanometer]]s (nm). These are not visible to the human eye, so they must be converted into visible light. This is done by making use of [[fluorescence]]. Ultraviolet photons are absorbed by electrons in the atoms of the lamp's interior fluorescent coating, causing a similar energy jump, then drop, with emission of a further photon. The photon that is emitted from this second interaction has a lower energy than the one that caused it. The chemicals that make up the phosphor are chosen so that these emitted photons are at wavelengths visible to the human eye. The difference in energy between the absorbed ultra-violet photon and the emitted visible light photon goes toward heating up the phosphor coating.

When the light is turned on, the electric power heats up the cathode enough for it to emit electrons ([[thermionic emission]]). These electrons collide with and ionize [[noble gas]] atoms inside the bulb surrounding the filament to form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] by the process of [[impact ionization]]. As a result of [[electron avalanche|avalanche ionization]], the conductivity of the ionized gas rapidly rises, allowing higher currents to flow through the lamp.

The fill gas helps determine the operating electrical characteristics of the lamp, but does not give off light itself. The fill gas effectively increases the distance that electrons travel through the tube, which allows an electron a greater chance of interacting with a mercury atom.  Argon atoms, excited to a metastable state by impact of an electron, can impart this energy to a neutral mercury atom and ionize it, described as the [[Penning ionization|Penning effect]]. This has the benefit of lowering the breakdown and operating voltage of the lamp, compared to other possible fill gases such as krypton.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Yen, Shigeo Shionoya, Hajime Yamamoto, ''Practical Applications of Phosphors'',CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4200-4369-2}},  pages 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
[[File:Germicidal Lamp 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Close-up of the cathodes of a [[germicidal lamp]] (an essentially similar design that uses no fluorescent phosphor, allowing the [[electrode]]s to be seen)]]

A fluorescent lamp tube is filled with a gas containing low-pressure mercury vapor and [[argon]], [[xenon]], [[neon]], or [[krypton]]. The pressure inside the lamp is around 0.3% of atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name="Alok"&gt;{{cite book

See Kane and Sell, 2001, page 185.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inner surface of the lamp is coated with a [[fluorescent]] (and often slightly [[phosphorescence|phosphorescent]]) coating made of varying blends of metallic and [[rare-earth]] [[phosphor]] salts. The lamp's electrodes are typically made of coiled [[tungsten]] and usually referred to as cathodes because of their prime function of emitting electrons. For this, they are coated with a mixture of barium, strontium and calcium oxides chosen to have a low [[thermionic emission]] temperature.

[[File:Germicidal UV discharge tube glow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[germicidal lamp]] uses a low-pressure mercury-vapor glow discharge identical to that in a fluorescent lamp, but the uncoated [[fused quartz]] envelope allows ultraviolet radiation to emerge.]]

Fluorescent lamp tubes are typically straight and range in length from about {{convert|100|mm|in|sp=us}} for miniature lamps, to {{convert|2.43|m|ft|sp=us}} for high-output lamps. Some lamps have the tube bent into a circle, used for table lamps or other places where a more compact light source is desired. Larger U-shaped lamps are used to provide the same amount of light in a more compact area, and are used for special architectural purposes. [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s have several small-diameter tubes joined in a bundle of two, four, or six, or a small diameter tube coiled into a helix, to provide a high amount of light output in little volume.

Light-emitting phosphors are applied as a paint-like coating to the inside of the tube. The organic solvents are allowed to evaporate, then the tube is heated to nearly the melting point of glass to drive off remaining organic compounds and fuse the coating to the lamp tube. Careful control of the grain size of the suspended phosphors is necessary; large grains, 35 micrometers or larger, lead to weak grainy coatings, whereas too many small particles 1 or 2 micrometers or smaller leads to poor light maintenance and efficiency. Most phosphors perform best with a particle size around 10 micrometers. The coating must be thick enough to capture all the ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc, but not so thick that the phosphor coating absorbs too much visible light. The first phosphors were synthetic versions of naturally occurring fluorescent minerals, with small amounts of metals added as activators. Later other compounds were discovered, allowing differing colors of lamps to be made.&lt;ref name="Kane2001"&gt;{{cite book

===Electrical aspects of operation===
[[File:LAjaHID.jpg|thumb|Different ballasts for fluorescent and discharge lamps]]
Fluorescent lamps are [[negative differential resistance]] devices, so as more current flows through them, the electrical resistance of the fluorescent lamp drops, allowing for even more current to flow. Connected directly to a [[constant-voltage power supply]], a fluorescent lamp would rapidly self-destruct because of the uncontrolled current flow. To prevent this, fluorescent lamps must use an auxiliary device, a [[electrical ballast|ballast]], to regulate the current flow through the lamp.

The terminal voltage across an operating lamp varies depending on the [[electric arc|arc]] current, tube diameter, temperature, and fill gas. A fixed part of the voltage drop is due to the electrodes.{{Cn|date=June 2017}}  A general lighting service {{Convert|48|in|mm|adj=on|abbr=out|sigfig=4|sp=us}} T12&lt;ref&gt;T12 specifies the bulb's diameter in 1/8 inch units; a T12 bulb is 12×(1/8)&amp;nbsp;inches or {{Convert|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on|sp=us}} in diameter.&lt;/ref&gt; lamp operates at 430&amp;nbsp;mA, with 100 volts drop. High output lamps operate at 800 mA, and some types operate up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;A. The power level varies from 33 to 82 watts per meter of tube length (10 to 25 W/ft) for T12 lamps.&lt;ref name=GE1978&gt;General Electric, ''Fluorescent Lamps Technical Bulletin TP 111R'', December 1978 pages 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest ballast for [[alternating current]] (AC) use is an [[inductor]] placed in series, consisting of a winding on a laminated magnetic core. The [[inductance]] of this winding limits the flow of AC current. This type is still used, for example, in 120 volt operated desk lamps using relatively short lamps. Ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency. Where the AC voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps, the ballast is often a step-up [[autotransformer]] with substantial [[leakage inductance]] (so as to limit the current flow). Either form of inductive ballast may also include a [[capacitor]] for [[power factor]] correction.
[[File:New GE Ballast.JPG|thumb|230&amp;nbsp;V [[electrical ballast|ballast]] for 18–20&amp;nbsp;W]]

Many different circuits have been used to operate fluorescent lamps. The choice of circuit is based on AC voltage, tube length, initial cost, long term cost, instant versus non-instant starting, temperature ranges and parts availability, etc.

Fluorescent lamps can run directly from a [[direct current]] (DC) supply of sufficient voltage to strike an arc. The ballast must be resistive, and would consume about as much power as the lamp. When operated from DC, the starting switch is often arranged to reverse the polarity of the supply to the lamp each time it is started; otherwise, the mercury accumulates at one end of the tube. Fluorescent lamps are (almost) never operated directly from DC for those reasons. Instead, an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] converts the DC into AC and provides the current-limiting function as described below for electronic ballasts.

===Effect of temperature===
[[File:Helical fluorescent lamp thermal image.jpg|thumb|Thermal image of a helical fluorescent lamp.]]
The light output and performance of fluorescent lamps is critically affected by the temperature of the bulb wall and its effect on the partial pressure of mercury vapor within the lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|Sell|2001|pp=c.f. 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each lamp contains a small amount of mercury, which must vaporize to support the lamp current and generate light. At low temperatures, the mercury is in the form of dispersed liquid droplets. As the lamp warms, more of the mercury is in vapor form. At higher temperatures, self-absorption in the vapor reduces the yield of UV and visible light. Since mercury condenses at the coolest spot in the lamp, careful design is required to maintain that spot at the optimum temperature, around {{convert|40|C|F}}.

Using an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] with some other metal reduces the vapor pressure and extends the optimum temperature range upward; however, the bulb wall "cold spot" temperature must still be controlled to prevent migration of the mercury out of the amalgam and condensing on the cold spot. Fluorescent lamps intended for higher output will have structural features such as a deformed tube or internal heat-sinks to control cold spot temperature and mercury distribution. Heavily loaded small lamps, such as compact fluorescent lamps, also include heat-sink areas in the tube to maintain mercury vapor pressure at the optimum value.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|Sell|2001|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Losses===
[[File:Fluorescent Energy.svg|thumb|right| A [[Sankey diagram]] of energy losses in a fluorescent lamp. In modern designs, the biggest loss is the [[quantum efficiency]] of converting high-energy UV photons to lower-energy visible light photons.]]
Only a fraction of the electrical energy input into a lamp is converted to useful light. The ballast dissipates some heat; electronic ballasts may be around 90% efficient. A fixed voltage drop occurs at the electrodes, which also produces heat. Some of the energy in the mercury vapor column is also dissipated, but about 85% is turned into visible and ultraviolet light.

The UV light is [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by the lamp's [[fluorescent]] coating, which re-radiates the energy at longer wavelengths to emit [[visible light]]. Not all the UV energy striking the phosphor gets converted into visible light. In a modern lamp, for every 100 incident photons of UV impacting the phosphor, only 86 visible light photons are emitted (a quantum efficiency of 86%). The largest single loss in modern lamps is due to the lower energy of each photon of visible light, compared to the energy of the UV photons that generated them (a phenomenon called [[Stokes shift]]). Incident photons have an energy of 5.5 electron volts but produce visible light photons with energy around 2.5 electron volts, so only 45% of the UV energy is used; the rest is dissipated as heat. If a so-called "two-photon" phosphor could be developed, this would improve the efficiency but much research has not yet found such a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|Sell|2001|pp=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold-cathode fluorescent lamps===  &lt;!-- target of redirect --&gt;
{{Redirect|CCFL}}
Most fluorescent lamps use electrodes that operate by [[thermionic emission]], meaning they are operated at a high enough temperature for the electrode material (usually aided by a special coating) to emit electrons into the tube by heat.

However, there are also tubes that operate in [[cold cathode]] mode, whereby electrons are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference ([[voltage]]) between the electrodes. This does not mean the electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does mean they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than [[hot cathode]] tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in [[liquid crystal display]]s). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.

Cold cathode lamps are generally less efficient than thermionic emission lamps because the cathode fall voltage is much higher. The increased fall voltage results in more power dissipation at tube ends, which does not contribute to light output. However, this is less significant with longer tubes. The increased power dissipation at tube ends also usually means cold cathode tubes have to be run at a lower loading than their thermionic emission equivalents. Given the higher tube voltage required anyway, these tubes can easily be made long, and even run as series strings. They are better suited for bending into special shapes for lettering and signage, and can also be instantly switched on or off.

===Starting===
The noble gas used in the fluorescent tube (commonly argon) must be ionized before the arc can "strike" within the tube. For small lamps, it does not take much voltage to strike the arc and starting the lamp presents no problem, but larger tubes require a substantial voltage (in the range of a thousand volts).

====Preheating====
[[File:Fluorescent Light.svg|thumb|A ''preheat'' fluorescent lamp circuit using an automatic starting switch. A: Fluorescent tube, B: Power (+220 volts), C: Starter, D: Switch (bi-metallic thermostat), E: Capacitor, F: Filaments, G: Ballast]]
[[File:Fluorescent lamp-electronic ballast starter-movie VNr°0001.ogv|thumb|left| Starting a preheat lamp. The automatic starter switch flashes orange each time it attempts to start the lamp.]]
This technique uses a combination [[electrical filament|filament]]–[[cathode]] at each end of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (bi-metallic) switch (see circuit diagram to the right) that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them; when the arc is struck the filaments are disconnected. This system is described as ''preheat'' in some countries and ''switchstart'' in others.&lt;ref name=philipsapp&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091122114429/http://www.nxp.com/documents/application_note/APPCHP8.pdf Philips Semiconductor: Power Semiconductor Applications – Lighting, p579]&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are standard equipment in 200–240&amp;nbsp;V countries (and for 100–120&amp;nbsp;V lamps up to about 30&amp;nbsp;watts).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[File:Starterp.jpg|thumb|left|A ''preheat'' fluorescent lamp "starter" (automatic starting switch)]]
Before the 1960s, four-pin thermal starters and manual switches were used.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} A mechanism then widely used for preheating, still in common use, is a [[glow switch starter]] (illustrated). It consists of a normally open [[bi-metallic strip|bi-metallic]] switch in a small sealed [[gas-discharge lamp]] containing inert gas (neon or argon).

[[File:Pulsestarter.JPG|thumb|Electronic fluorescent lamp starters]]
When power is first applied to the circuit, there will be a [[glow discharge]] across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by [[thermionic emission]]. In the starter, the touching contacts [[Short-circuit|short out]] the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an [[inductive kick]] which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A [[power factor]] correction (PFC) [[capacitor]] draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.&lt;ref name=philipsapp/&gt;

Once the tube strikes, the impinging main discharge keeps the cathodes hot, permitting continued electron emission without the need for the filaments to continue to be heated. The starter switch does not close again because the voltage across the lit tube is insufficient to start a glow discharge in the starter.&lt;ref name=philipsapp/&gt;

With automated starters such as glow starters, a failing tube will cycle endlessly, flickering as the lamp quickly goes out because the [[thermionic emission|emission mix]] is insufficient to keep the lamp current high enough to keep the glow starter open. This runs the ballast at higher temperature. Some more advanced starters time out in this situation, and do not attempt repeated starts until power is reset.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Some older systems used a thermal over-current trip to detect repeated starting attempts and disable the circuit until manually reset.  The switch contacts in glow starters are subject to wear and inevitably fail eventually, so the starter is manufactured as a plug-in replaceable unit.

More recently introduced electronic starters use a different method to preheat the cathodes.&lt;ref name=electrostart&gt;[http://www.tabelek.co.uk/datasheets/UM2-UM3-Datasheet.pdf Datasheet of typical electronic starter (not fast start), with detailed explanation of operation]&lt;/ref&gt; They may be designed to be plug-in interchangeable with glow starters for use in standard fittings. They commonly use a purpose-designed semiconductor switch and "soft start" the lamp by preheating the cathodes before applying a controlled starting pulse which strikes the lamp first time without flickering; this dislodges a minimal amount of material from the cathodes during starting, giving longer lamp life than possible with the uncontrolled impulses to which the lamp is subjected in a switchstart.&lt;ref name=philipsapp/&gt; This is claimed to prolong lamp life by a factor of typically 3 to 4 times for a lamp frequently switched on as in domestic use,&lt;ref name=faststart&gt;[http://www.tabelek.co.uk/datasheets/300C-Datasheet.pdf Datasheet of typical fast start electronic starter, with detailed explanation of operation]&lt;/ref&gt; and to reduce the blackening of the ends of the lamp typical of fluorescent tubes. The circuit is typically complex, but the complexity is built into the IC. Electronic starters may be optimized for fast starting (typical start time of 0.3 seconds),&lt;ref name=faststart/&gt;&lt;ref name=type300c&gt;[http://www.tabelek.co.uk/product-300C-fastlux-electronic-fluorescent-tube-starter.asp Data on an ultrafast starter, with nominal startup time of 0.3 seconds]&lt;/ref&gt; or for most reliable starting even at low temperatures and with low supply voltages, with a startup time of 2–4 seconds.&lt;ref name=um2&gt;[http://www.tabelek.co.uk/product-um2-multipulse-electronic-fluorescent-tube-starter.asp Data on a typical starter for even adverse conditions, with nominal startup time of 2.4 seconds]&lt;/ref&gt; The faster-start units may produce audible noise during start-up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.tpg.com.au/pschamb/light.html Quick Start for Fluorescent Lights] "All three of the 'FAST' (&lt; .5 seconds) starter brands caused an audible 'BURRRRRRRP' noise in some light fittings as they started and this is an inherent problem caused by their use of the faster 'DC' heating. It is worse with higher wattage tubes and if there is any loose metal in the light fitting."&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic starters only attempt to start a lamp for a short time when power is initially applied, and do not repeatedly attempt to restrike a lamp that is dead and unable to sustain an arc; some automatically shut down a failed lamp.&lt;ref name=electrostart/&gt; This eliminates the re-striking of a lamp and the continuous flickering of a failing lamp with a glow starter. Electronic starters are not subject to wear and do not need replacing periodically, although they may fail like any other electronic circuit. Manufacturers typically quote lives of 20 years, or as long as the light fitting.&lt;ref name=type300c/&gt;&lt;ref name=um2/&gt; Starters are inexpensive, typically less than 50¢ for the short-lived glow type (depending upon lamp power), and perhaps ten times more for the electronic type {{As of|2013|lc=on}}.

====Instant start====
Another type of tube does not have filaments to start it at all.  ''Instant start'' fluorescent tubes simply use a high enough voltage to break down the gas and mercury column and thereby start arc conduction. These tubes can be identified by a single pin at each end of the tube. The lamp holders have a "disconnect" socket at the low-voltage end which disconnects the ballast when the tube is removed, to prevent [[electric shock]]. In North America, low-cost lighting fixtures with an integrated electronic ballast use instant start on lamps originally designed for preheating, although it shortens lamp life.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} This ballast technology isn't common outside North America.

====Rapid start====
Newer ''rapid start''  ballast designs provide filament power windings within the ballast; these rapidly and continuously warm the filaments/cathodes using low-voltage AC. Usually operating at a lower arc voltage than the instant start design; no inductive [[voltage spike]] is produced for starting, so the lamps must be mounted near a grounded (earthed) reflector to allow the glow discharge to propagate through the tube and initiate the arc discharge. In some lamps a grounded "starting aid" strip is attached to the outside of the lamp glass. This ballast technology isn't used outside North America, where 220-240 V line voltage is common, and are incompatible with the European energy saver T8 fluorescent lamps because these lamps requires a higher starting voltage than that of the open circuit voltage of rapid start ballasts.

[[File:Magnetek Watt Reducer HPF Rapid Start Ballast.jpg|thumb|right|A rapid-start "iron" (magnetic) [[electrical ballast|ballast]] continually heats the [[cathode]]s at the ends of the lamps. This ballast runs two F40T12 lamps in series.]]

====Quick-start====
Quick-start ballasts use a small auto-transformer to heat the filaments when power is first applied. When an arc strikes, the filament heating power is reduced and the tube will start within half a second. The auto-transformer is either combined with the ballast or may be a separate unit. Tubes need to be mounted near an earthed metal reflector in order for them to strike. Quick-start ballasts are more common in commercial installations because of lower maintenance costs. A quick-start ballast eliminates the need for a starter switch, a common source of lamp failures. Nonetheless, Quick-start ballasts are also used in domestic (residential) installations because of the desirable feature that a Quick-start ballast light turns on nearly immediately after power is applied (when a switch is turned on). Quick-start ballasts are used only on 240&amp;nbsp;V circuits and are designed for use with the older, less efficient T12 tubes.

====Semi-resonant start====
[[File:65W SRS fluorescent lamp starting.OGG|thumb|left|A 65-watt fluorescent lamp starting on a semi-resonant start circuit]]
[[File:semi resonant start circuit.png|thumb|right|A semi-resonant start circuit diagram]]
The semi-resonant start circuit was invented by Thorn Lighting for use with [[fluorescent-lamp formats|T12]] fluorescent tubes. This method uses a double wound transformer and a capacitor. With no arc current, the transformer and capacitor [[electrical resonance|resonate]] at line frequency and generate about twice the supply voltage across the tube, and a small electrode heating current.&lt;ref&gt;Thorn Lighting Technical Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; This tube voltage is too low to strike the arc with cold electrodes, but as the electrodes heat up to thermionic emission temperature, the tube striking voltage falls below that of the ringing voltage, and the arc strikes. As the electrodes heat, the lamp slowly, over three to five seconds, reaches full brightness. As the arc current increases and tube voltage drops, the circuit provides current limiting.

Semi-resonant start circuits are mainly restricted to use in commercial installations because of the higher initial cost of circuit components. However, there are no starter switches to be replaced and cathode damage is reduced during starting making lamps last longer, reducing maintenance costs. Because of the high open circuit tube voltage, this starting method is particularly good for starting tubes in cold locations. Additionally, the circuit power factor is almost 1.0, and no additional power factor correction is needed in the lighting installation. As the design requires that twice the supply voltage must be lower than the cold-cathode striking voltage (or the tubes would erroneously instant-start), this design cannot be used with {{nowrap|240 volt}} AC power unless the tubes are at least {{convert|1.2|m|abbr=on}} length.  Semi-resonant start fixtures are generally incompatible with energy saving T8 retrofit tubes, because such tubes have a higher starting voltage than T12 lamps and may not start reliably, especially in low temperatures. Recent proposals in some countries to phase out T12 tubes will reduce the application of this starting method.

====Programmed start====
This is used with electronic ballasts shown below. This ballast applies power to the filaments first, then after a short delay to allow the cathodes to preheat, applies voltage to the lamps to strike an arc. This ballast gives the best life and most starts from lamps, and so is preferred for applications with very frequent power cycling such as vision examination rooms and restrooms with a motion detector switch.

====Electronic ballasts====
[[File:Fluorescent-lamp-electronic-ballast.webm|thumb|left|Fluorescent lamp with an electronic ballast.]]
[[File:EL 2x58ngn.jpg|thumb|Electronic ballast for fluorescent lamp, 2×58&amp;nbsp;W]]
[[File:Fluorescent Lamp Inverter.png|thumb|[[Electronic ballast]] basic schematic]]
[[File:TCS lamps2.jpg|thumb|[[Electronic ballast]]s and different compact fluorescent lamps]]
Electronic ballasts employ [[transistor]]s to change the supply frequency into high-[[frequency]] [[alternating current|AC]] while also regulating the current flow in the lamp. Some still use an inductance to limit the current, but the higher frequency allows a much smaller inductance to be used. Others use a capacitor-transistor combination to replace the inductor,  since a transistor and capacitor working together can [[gyrator#Application: a simulated inductor|simulate the action of an inductor]]. These ballasts take advantage of the higher efficacy of lamps operated with higher-frequency current, which rises by almost 10% at {{nowrap|10 kHz}}, compared to efficacy at normal power frequency. When the AC period is shorter than the relaxation time to de-ionize mercury atoms in the discharge column, the discharge stays closer to optimum operating condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|Sell|2001|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic ballasts are commonly supplied with AC power, which is internally converted to DC and then back to a variable frequency AC waveform. Depending upon the capacitance and the quality of constant-current [[pulse-width modulation]], this can largely eliminate modulation at 100 or 120&amp;nbsp;Hz.

Low cost ballasts mostly contain only a simple oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle is called the [[Resonant inverter|current resonant inverter]] circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1&amp;nbsp;kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) [[thermistor]]s to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.

More complex electronic ballasts use programmed start. The output frequency is started above the resonance frequency of the output circuit of the ballast; and after the filaments are heated, the frequency is rapidly decreased. If the frequency approaches the [[resonant frequency]] of the ballast, the output voltage will increase so much that the lamp will ignite. If the lamp does not ignite, an electronic circuit stops the operation of the ballast.

Many electronic ballasts are controlled by a [[microcontroller]] or similar, and these are sometimes called digital ballasts. Digital ballasts can apply quite complex logic to lamp starting and operation. This enables functions such as testing for broken electrodes and missing tubes before attempting to start, auto detect tube replacement, and auto detection of tube type, such that a single ballast can be used with several different tubes, even those that operate at different arc currents, etc. Once such fine grained control over the starting and arc current is achievable, features such as dimming, and having the ballast maintain a constant light level against changing sunlight contribution are all easily included in the embedded microcontroller software, and can be found in various manufacturers' products.

Since introduction in the 1990s, high-frequency ballasts have been used in general lighting fixtures with either rapid start or pre-heat lamps. These ballasts convert the incoming power to an output frequency in excess of {{nowrap|20 kHz}}. This increases lamp efficiency. These are used in several applications, including new generation [[tanning lamp]] systems, whereby a 100 watt lamp (e.g., F71T12BP) can be lit using 90 watts of actual power while obtaining the same [[luminous flux]] (measured in lumens) as magnetic ballasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Conservation Standards for Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/pdfs/flballast_preanalysis_ch3.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803184327/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/pdfs/flballast_preanalysis_ch3.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 August 2012|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=29 January 2012|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These ballasts operate with voltages that can be almost 600 volts, requiring some consideration in housing design, and can cause a minor limitation in the length of the wire leads from the ballast to the lamp ends.

===End of life===
The end of life failure mode for fluorescent lamps varies depending on how they are used and their control gear type. Often the light will turn pink (see [[#Loss of mercury|Loss of mercury]]), with black burns on the ends of the lamp due to [[sputtering]] of [[thermionic emission|emission mix]] (see below). The lamp may also flicker at a noticeable rate (see [[#Flicker problems|Flicker problems]]).

====Emission mix====
[[File:Fluorescent wear - sputter.png|thumb|right|This tube, which was turned on and off regularly, could no longer start after enough thermionic emission mix had sputtered from the cathodes, causing their [[work function]] to increase beyond an operable level. The vaporized material adheres to the glass surrounding the electrodes, causing it to darken and turn black.]]
[[Image:Thermionic filament.jpg|thumb|left|Closeup of the filament on a low pressure mercury gas discharge lamp showing white [[thermionic emission]] mix coating on the central portion of the coil acting as [[hot cathode]]. Typically made of a mixture of [[barium]], [[strontium]] and [[calcium]] oxides, the coating is sputtered away every time the lamp starts, often eventually resulting in lamp failure.]]
The "[[thermionic emission|emission mix]]" on the lamp filaments/[[hot cathode|cathodes]] is required to enable electrons to pass into the gas via [[thermionic emission]] at the lamp operating voltages used. The mix is slowly [[sputter]]ed off by bombardment with electrons and mercury ions during operation, but a larger amount is sputtered off each time the lamp is started with cold cathodes. The method of starting the lamp has a significant impact on this. Lamps operated for typically less than 3 hours each switch-on will normally run out of the emission mix before other parts of the lamp fail. The sputtered emission mix forms the dark marks at the lamp ends seen in old lamps. When all the emission mix is gone, the cathode cannot pass sufficient electrons into the gas fill to maintain the gas discharge at the designed lamp operating voltage.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Ideally, the control gear should shut down the lamp when this happens. However, some control gear will provide sufficient increased voltage to continue operating the lamp in [[cold cathode]] mode,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} which will cause overheating of the lamp end and rapid disintegration of the electrodes (filament goes open-circuit) and filament support wires until they are completely gone or the glass cracks, destroying the low pressure gas fill and stopping the gas discharge.

====Ballast electronics====
This may occur in [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s with integral [[electrical ballast]]s or in linear lamps. Ballast electronics failure is a somewhat random process that follows the standard [[failure modes of electronics|failure profile for any electronic device]]. There is an initial small peak of early failures, followed by a drop and steady increase over lamp life. Life of electronics is heavily dependent on operating temperature—it typically halves for each 10&amp;nbsp;°C temperature rise. The quoted average life of a lamp is usually at {{convert|25|C|F}} ambient (this may vary by country). The average life of the electronics at this temperature is normally greater than this, so at this temperature, not many lamps will fail because the electronics fail. In some fittings, the ambient temperature could be well above this, in which case failure of the electronics may become the predominant failure mechanism. Similarly, running a compact fluorescent lamp base-up will result in hotter electronics, which can cause shorter average life (particularly with higher power rated ones). Electronic ballasts should be designed to shut down the tube when the emission mix runs out as described above. In the case of integral electronic ballasts, since they never have to work again, this is sometimes done by having them deliberately burn out some component to permanently cease operation.

In most CFLs the filaments are connected in series, with a small capacitor between them. The discharge, once lit, is in parallel to the capacitor and presents a lower-resistance path, effectively shorting the capacitor out.

====Phosphor====
The phosphor drops off in efficiency during use. By around 25,000 operating hours, it will typically be half the brightness of a new lamp (although some manufacturers claim much longer half-lives for their lamps). Lamps that do not suffer failures of the emission mix or integral ballast electronics will eventually develop this failure mode. They still work, but have become dim and inefficient. The process is slow, and often becomes obvious only when a new lamp is operating next to an old one.

====Loss of mercury====
[[File:Mercury Adsorbed CFL.jpg|thumb|right|Compact fluorescent lamp that has reached end of life because of mercury adsorption. Light is produced only by the base argon fill.]]
[[File:Fluorescent wear - mercury adsorption.png|thumb|left|Fluorescent tubes that are perpetually lit eventually suffer from mercury adsorption. As the pressure within the lamps decreases, the arc discharge becomes a [[glow discharge]], dimming considerably and displaying the accompanying "Faraday cones", which appear as rings of light that move across the lamps.]]
As in all mercury-based [[gas-filled tube]]s, mercury is slowly [[adsorption|adsorbed]] onto the glass, phosphor, and tube electrodes throughout the life of the lamp, until it can no longer function. Loss of mercury will take over from failure of the phosphor in some lamps. The failure symptoms are similar, except loss of mercury initially causes an extended run-up time to full light output, and finally causes the lamp to glow a dim pink when the mercury runs out and the argon base gas takes over as the primary discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Corazza |first1=A. |last2=Giorgi |first2=S. |last3=Massaro |first3=V. |title=Mercury Dosing in Fluorescent Lamps |conference=Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting |date=October 2008 |issn=0197-2618 
 |publisher=IEEE |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4659025 |doi=10.1109/08IAS.2008.237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Subjecting the tube to asymmetric waveforms, where the total current flow through the tube does not cancel out and the tube effectively operates under a DC bias, causes asymmetric distribution of mercury ions along the tube due to [[cataphoresis]]. The localized depletion of mercury vapor pressure manifests as pink luminescence of the base gas in the vicinity of one of the electrodes, and the operating lifetime of the lamp may be dramatically shortened. This can be an issue with some poorly designed [[inverter (electrical)|inverters]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022003220/http://www.htl.co.jp/img/p_pro4_p10.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Burned-out filaments====
The filaments can burn out (fail) at the end of the lamp's lifetime, opening the circuit and losing the capability to heat up. Both filaments lose function as they are connected in series, with just a simple switch start circuit a broken filament will render the lamp completely useless. Filaments rarely burn out or fail open circuit unless the filament becomes depleted of emitter and the control gear is able to supply a high enough voltage across the tube to operate it in [[cold cathode]] mode. Some digital electronic ballasts are capable of detecting broken filaments and can still strike an arc with one or both filaments broken providing there is still sufficient emitter. A broken filament in a lamp attached to a magnetic ballast often causes both lamps to burn out or flicker.

==Phosphors and the spectrum of emitted light==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Indigo]] --&gt;
[[File:Fluorescent lamp spectrum.jpg|thumb|Light from a fluorescent tube lamp reflected by a [[CD]] shows the individual bands of color.]]

The spectrum of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp is the combination of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating. The [[spectral line]]s from the mercury emission and the phosphorescence effect give a combined spectral distribution of light that is different from those produced by incandescent sources. The relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source. Colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions. For example, some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing. A healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light's spectral composition, and may be gauged by its [[color rendering index]] (CRI).

===Color temperature===
{{Main|Color temperature}}
[[File:Kelvin Temperature Chart.svg|thumb|The [[color temperature]] of different electric lamps]]
[[Correlated color temperature]] (CCT) is a measure of the "shade" of whiteness of a light source compared with a blackbody. Typical incandescent lighting is 2700 K, which is yellowish-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3nBhzo-bQWsC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;dq=Typical+incandescent+lighting+is+2700+K,+which+is+yellowish-white#v=onepage&amp;q=Typical%20incandescent%20lighting%20is%202700%20K,%20which%20is%20yellowish-white&amp;f=false|title=Lighting Design Basics|last=Karlen|first=Mark|last2=Benya|first2=James R.|last3=Spangler|first3=Christina|date=2012-06-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118287927|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halogen lighting is 3000 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mThZDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT71&amp;dq=%C2%A0Halogen+lighting+is+3000+K#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Halogen%20lighting%20is%203000%20K&amp;f=false|title=Practical Lighting Design with LEDs|last=Lenk|first=Ron|last2=Lenk|first2=Carol|date=2017-03-10|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781119165323|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorescent lamps are manufactured to a chosen CCT by altering the mixture of phosphors inside the tube. Warm-white fluorescents have CCT of 2700 K and are popular for residential lighting. Neutral-white fluorescents have a CCT of 3000 K or 3500 K. Cool-white fluorescents have a CCT of 4100 K and are popular for office lighting. Daylight fluorescents have a CCT of 5000 K to 6500 K, which is bluish-white.

High CCT lighting generally requires higher light levels. At dimmer illumination levels, the human eye perceives lower color temperatures as more pleasant, as related through the [[Kruithof curve]]. So, a dim 2700 K incandescent lamp appears comfortable and a bright 5000 K lamp also appears natural, but a dim 5000 K fluorescent lamp appears too pale. Daylight-type fluorescents look natural only if they are very bright.

===Color rendering index===
[[File:Helical fluorescent lamp spectrum by diffraction grating.JPG|thumb|A helical cool-white fluorescent lamp reflected in a [[diffraction grating]] reveals the various [[spectral lines]] which make up the light.]]
[[File:Various lighting spectrums - Flurescent incandescent diode and candle.jpg|thumb|Fluorescent spectra in comparison with other forms of lighting. Clockwise from upper left: Fluorescent lamp, [[incandescent bulb]], [[candle]] flame and [[LED lighting]].]]
{{Main|Color rendering index}}
Color rendering index (CRI) is a measure of how well colors can be perceived using light from a source, relative to light from a reference source such as daylight or a blackbody of the same [[color temperature]]. By definition, an incandescent lamp has a CRI of 100. Real-life fluorescent tubes achieve CRIs of anywhere from 50 to 98. Fluorescent lamps with low CRI have phosphors that emit too little red light. Skin appears less pink, and hence "unhealthy" compared with incandescent lighting. Colored objects appear muted. For example, a low CRI 6800 K halophosphate tube (an extreme example) will make reds appear dull red or even brown. Since the eye is relatively less efficient at detecting red light, an improvement in color rendering index, with increased energy in the red part of the spectrum, may reduce the overall luminous efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unknown|n.d.|p=8}} (only page number given)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lighting arrangements use fluorescent tubes in an assortment of tints of white. Mixing tube types within fittings can improve the color reproduction of lower quality tubes.

===Phosphor composition===
Some of the least pleasant light comes from tubes containing the older, halophosphate-type [[phosphor]]s (chemical formula [[calcium|Ca]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;([[phosphorus|P]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;([[fluorine|F]], [[chlorine|Cl]]):[[antimony|Sb]]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[manganese|Mn]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). This phosphor mainly emits yellow and blue light, and relatively little green and red. In the absence of a reference, this mixture appears white to the eye, but the light has an incomplete [[spectrum]]. The [[color rendering index]] (CRI) of such lamps is around 60.

Since the 1990s, higher-quality fluorescent lamps use either a higher-CRI halophosphate coating, or a ''triphosphor'' mixture, based on [[europium]] and [[terbium]] ions, which have emission bands more evenly distributed over the spectrum of visible light. High-CRI halophosphate and triphosphor tubes give a more natural color reproduction to the human eye. The CRI of such lamps is typically 82–100.

==Applications==
Fluorescent lamps come in many shapes and sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8sFOCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91&amp;dq=%C2%A0Fluorescent+lamps+come+in+many+shapes+and+sizes#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Fluorescent%20lamps%20come%20in%20many%20shapes%20and%20sizes&amp;f=false|title=Quality Lighting for High Performance Buildings|last=Stiller|first=Michael|date=2013-07-16|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781304236159|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[compact fluorescent lamp]] (CFL) is becoming more popular. Many compact fluorescent lamps integrate the auxiliary electronics into the base of the lamp, allowing them to fit into a regular light bulb socket.

In US residences, fluorescent lamps are mostly found in [[kitchens]], [[basements]], or [[garage (house)|garages]],  but schools and businesses find the cost savings of fluorescent lamps to be significant and rarely use incandescent lights. Tax incentives and building codes result in higher use in places such as [[California]].

In other countries, residential use of fluorescent lighting varies depending on the price of energy, financial and environmental concerns of the local population, and acceptability of the light output. In [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] it is very rare to see [[incandescent]] bulbs in buildings anywhere.

Some countries are encouraging the [[phase-out of incandescent light bulbs]] and substitution of incandescent lamps with fluorescent lamps or other types of energy-efficient lamps.

In addition to general lighting, special fluorescent lights are often used in [[stage lighting]] for film and video production. They are cooler than traditional halogen light sources, and use high-frequency ballasts to prevent video flickering and high color-rendition index lamps to approximate daylight color temperatures.

==Advantages==
===Luminous efficacy===
Fluorescent lamps convert more of the input power to visible light than incandescent lamps, though as of 2013 [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] are sometimes even more efficient and are more rapidly increasing in efficiency. A typical 100 watt tungsten filament incandescent lamp may convert only 5% of its power input to visible white light (400–700&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength), whereas typical fluorescent lamps convert about 22% of the power input to visible white light.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unknown|n.d.|p=20}} (Only page number given)&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficacy of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 lumens per watt for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]] per watt&lt;ref name="spiraltubes"&gt;{{cite web | author=Panasonic | title=Panasonic Spiral Fluorescent ceiling lights, 124.3lm/W | url=http://panasonic.co.jp/corp/news/official.data/data.dir/jn100609-1/jn100609-1.html | accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a modern electronic ballast, commonly averaging 50 to 67&amp;nbsp;lm/W overall. Most compact fluorescents above 13 watts with integral electronic ballasts achieve about 60&amp;nbsp;lm/W. Lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.misty.com/don/ |title=Light and Lighting Facts and Bits of Data! |author=Klipstein, Donald L. |accessdate=2007-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228015052/http://members.misty.com/don/ |archivedate=December 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a given fluorescent tube, a high-frequency electronic ballast gives about a 10% efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast. It is necessary to include the ballast loss when evaluating the efficacy of a fluorescent lamp system; this can be about 25% of the lamp power with magnetic ballasts, and around 10% with electronic ballasts.

Fluorescent lamp efficacy is dependent on lamp temperature at the coldest part of the lamp. In T8 lamps this is in the center of the tube. In [[T5 fluorescent lamp|T5 lamps]] this is at the end of the tube with the text stamped on it. The ideal temperature for a T8 lamp is {{convert|25|C|F}} while the T5 lamp is ideally at {{convert|35|C|F}}.

===Life===
Typically a fluorescent lamp will last 10 to 20 times as long as an equivalent incandescent lamp when operated several hours at a time. Under standard test conditions general lighting lamps have 9,000 hours or longer service life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Donald G. |editor1-last=Fink |editor2-first=H. Wayne |editor2-last=Beaty |title=Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers |edition=11th |publisher=McGraw Hill |date=1978 |isbn=978-0-070-20974-9 |pages=22–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher initial cost of a fluorescent lamp compared with an incandescent lamp is usually more than compensated for by lower energy consumption over its life.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). Building Research Institute. ''Building illumination: the effect of new lighting levels'' Publisher National Academies, 1959. Page 81&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=March 2013}}

A few manufacturers are producing T8 lamps with 90,000 hour lamp lives, rivalling the life of LED lamps.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Lower luminance===
Compared with an incandescent lamp, a fluorescent tube is a more diffuse and physically larger light source. In suitably designed lamps, light can be more evenly distributed without point source of glare such as seen from an undiffused incandescent filament; the lamp is large compared to the typical distance between lamp and illuminated surfaces.

===Lower heat===
Fluorescent lamps give off about one-fifth the heat of equivalent incandescent lamps. This greatly reduces the size, cost, and energy consumption devoted to air conditioning for office buildings that would typically have many lights and few windows.

==Disadvantages==

===Frequent switching===
If the lamp is installed where it is frequently switched on and off, it will age rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511132153/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/29267-5.4.3.pdf|archivedate=May 11, 2011|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/29267-5.4.3.pdf |publisher=eere.energy.gov |title=Compact Fluorescent Lighting |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under extreme conditions, its lifespan may be much shorter than a cheap incandescent lamp. Each start cycle slightly erodes the electron-emitting surface of the cathodes; when all the emission material is gone, the lamp cannot start with the available ballast voltage. Fixtures intended for flashing of lights (such as for advertising) will use a ballast that maintains cathode temperature when the arc is off, preserving the life of the lamp.

The extra energy used to start a fluorescent lamp is equivalent to a few seconds of normal operation; it is more energy-efficient to switch off lamps when not required for several minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science Fact or Science Fiction: Fluorescent Lights|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028205846/http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2011/10/22/october-22-2011|archivedate=October 28, 2011|url=http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2011/10/22/october-22-2011/|work=Quirks and Quarks|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When to Turn Off Your Lights|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/when-turn-your-lights|website=U.S. Department of Energy|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and safety issues===
{{Main|Fluorescent lamps and health}}
If a fluorescent lamp is broken, a very small amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment. About 99% of the mercury is typically contained in the phosphor, especially on lamps that are near the end of their life.&lt;ref name="chem.unep.ch"&gt;Floyd, et al. (2002), quoted on page 184 of [http://www.unep.org/hazardoussubstances/Portals/9/Mercury/Documents/Publications/Toolkit/Hg%20Toolkit-Reference-Report-rev-Jan11.pdf Toolkit for identification and quantification of mercury releases] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt; The broken glass is usually considered a greater hazard than the small amount of spilled mercury.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The EPA recommends airing out the location of a fluorescent tube break and using wet paper towels to help pick up the broken glass and fine particles. Any glass and used towels should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag. Vacuum cleaners can cause the particles to become airborne, and should not be used.&lt;ref&gt;Fluorescent lamp cleanup [http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf] Accessed 22 Apr 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2016}}

Fluorescent lamps with magnetic [[Electrical ballast|ballasts]] flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 100 or 120&amp;nbsp;Hz and this flickering can cause problems for some individuals with [[light sensitivity]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/soar/vision/light.html|title=Working with Light Sensitivity}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are listed as problematic for some individuals with [[autism]], [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/media/epilepsy.html|title=Accommodation Ideas for Employees with Epilepsy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/media/Lupus.html|title=Accommodation and Compliance Series: Employees with Lupus}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[Lyme disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10610642|title=Musculoskeletal and neurologic outcomes in patients with previously treated Lyme disease | volume=131 | issue=12|date=December 1999|journal=Ann.

===Ultraviolet emission===
Fluorescent lamps emit a small amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. A 1993 study in the US found that ultraviolet exposure from sitting under fluorescent lights for eight hours is equivalent to one minute of sun exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Lytle|first= CD |author2=Cyr, WH |author3=Beer, JZ |author4=Miller, SA |author5=James, RH |author6=Landry, RJ |author7=Jacobs, ME |author8=Kaczmarek, RG |author9=Sharkness, CM |author10=Gaylor, D |display-authors=etal |title= An Estimation of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Risk from Ultraviolet Radiation Emitted by Fluorescent Lamps|journal= Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed|date=December 1993|volume= 9|issue= 6|pages= 268–74|pmid= 1343229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultraviolet radiation from compact fluorescent lamps may exacerbate symptoms in photosensitive individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicole|first1=Wendee|title=Ultraviolet leaks from CFLs|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=2012|volume=120|issue=10|page=a387|doi=10.1289/ehp.120-a387|pmid=23026199|pmc=3491932}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=Harry|last2=Ferguson|first2=James|title=The risk to normal and photosensitive individuals from exposure to light from compact fluorescent lamps|journal=Photodermatology, Photoimmunology &amp; Photomedicine|date=2011|volume=27|issue=3|pages=131–137|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0781.2011.00576.x|pmid=21535166}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=SCENIHR (Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly-Identified Health Risks)|title=Scientific opinion on light sensitivity|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_019.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2016|date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultraviolet light from a fluorescent lamp can degrade the pigments in paintings (especially watercolor pigments) and bleach the dyes used in [[textiles]] and some printing. Valuable art work must be protected from ultraviolet light by placing additional glass or transparent [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic sheets]] between the lamp and the art work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Ballast===
[[Image:Old USSR Ballast.JPG|thumb|Magnetic single-lamp [[electrical ballast|ballasts]] have a low [[power factor]].]]
Fluorescent lamps require a [[electrical ballast|ballast]] to stabilize the current through the lamp, and to provide the initial striking voltage required to start the arc discharge. This increases the cost of fluorescent [[light fixture]]s, though often one ballast is shared between two or more lamps. Electromagnetic ballasts with a minor fault can produce an audible humming or buzzing noise. Magnetic ballasts are usually filled with a [[tar]]-like potting compound to reduce emitted noise. Hum is eliminated in lamps with a high-frequency electronic ballast. Energy lost in magnetic ballasts was around 10% of lamp input power according to GE literature from 1978.&lt;ref name=GE1978 /&gt; Electronic ballasts reduce this loss.

===Power quality and radio interference===
Simple inductive fluorescent lamp ballasts have a [[power factor]] of less than unity. Inductive ballasts include power factor correction capacitors. Simple electronic ballasts may also have low power factor due to their rectifier input stage.

Fluorescent lamps are a non-linear load and generate harmonic currents in the electrical power supply. The arc within the lamp may generate radio frequency noise, which can be conducted through power wiring. Suppression of radio interference is possible. Very good suppression is possible, but adds to the cost of the fluorescent fixtures.

===Operating temperature===
Fluorescent lamps operate best around room temperature. At much lower or higher temperatures, [[Luminous efficacy|efficacy]] decreases. At below-freezing temperatures standard lamps may not start. Special lamps may be needed for reliable service outdoors in cold weather. In applications such as road and railway signalling, fluorescent lamps which do not generate as much heat as incandescent lamps may not melt snow and ice build up around the lamp, leading to reduced visibility.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Lamp shape===
Fluorescent tubes are long, low-luminance sources compared with high pressure arc lamps, incandescent lamps and LEDs. However, low luminous intensity of the emitting surface is useful because it reduces [[Glare (vision)|glare]]. Lamp fixture design must control light from a long tube instead of a compact globe.

The [[compact fluorescent lamp]] (CFL) replaces regular incandescent bulbs. However, some CFLs will not fit some lamps, because the harp (heavy wire shade support bracket) is shaped for the narrow neck of an incandescent lamp, while CFLs tend to have a wide housing for their electronic ballast close to the lamp's base.

===Flicker problems===
[[File:Fluorescentfixturebelow20806.JPG|thumb|The "beat effect" problem created when shooting photos under standard fluorescent lighting]]
Fluorescent lamps using a magnetic power line frequency ballast do not give out a steady light; instead, they flicker at twice the supply frequency. This results in fluctuations not only with light output but color temperature as well,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.tommyimages.com/2009/06/photographing-under-fluorescent-lights.html "Exposure and Color Temperature Variations When Photographing Under Fluorescent Lights"]&lt;/ref&gt; which may pose problems for photography and people who are sensitive to the flicker. Even among persons not sensitive to light flicker, a [[stroboscopic effect]] can be noticed, where something spinning at just the right speed may appear stationary if illuminated solely by a single fluorescent lamp. This effect is eliminated by paired lamps operating on a lead-lag ballast. Unlike a true strobe lamp, the light level drops in appreciable time and so substantial "blurring" of the moving part would be evident.

In some circumstances, fluorescent lamps operated at the power supply frequency (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) can also produce flicker at the same frequency itself, which is noticeable by more people. This can happen in the last few hours of tube life when the cathode emission coating at one end has almost run out or a filament is open circuit, and that [[cathode]] starts having difficulty emitting enough [[electron]]s into the gas fill, resulting in slight [[Rectifier|rectification]] and hence uneven light output in positive and negative going AC cycles. Power frequency flicker can also sometimes be emitted from the very ends of the tubes, if each tube electrode produces a slightly different light output pattern on each half-cycle. Flicker at power frequency is more noticeable in the [[peripheral vision]] than it is when viewed directly, as is all flicker (since the peripheral vision is faster—has a higher critical frequency—than the central vision).

Near the end of life, fluorescent lamps can start flickering at a frequency lower than the power frequency. This is due to a dynamic instability inherent in the negative resistance of the plasma source,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Stanislav |last=Glozman |first2=Shmuel |last2=Ben-Yaakov |title=Dynamic Interaction Analysis of HF Ballasts and Fluorescent Lamps Based on Envelope Simulation |date= September–October 2001 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=1531–1536 |doi=10.1109/28.952531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be from a bad lamp, a bad ballast, or a bad starter; or occasionally from a poor connection to power.

[[File:Fluorescent beat effect.ogv|thumb|right|The "beat effect" problem created when shooting films under standard fluorescent lighting]]
New fluorescent lamps may show a twisting spiral pattern of light in a part of the lamp. This effect is due to loose cathode material and usually disappears after a few hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unknown|n.d.|p=22}} (only page number given)&lt;/ref&gt;

Electromagnetic ballasts may also cause problems for video recording as there can be a so-called ''[[beat (acoustics)|beat]] effect'' between the periodic reading of a camera's sensor and the fluctuations in intensity of the fluorescent lamp.

Fluorescent lamps using high-frequency electronic ballasts do not produce visible light flicker, since above about 5&amp;nbsp;kHz, the excited electron state half-life is longer than a half cycle,{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} and light production becomes continuous. Operating frequencies of electronic ballasts are selected to avoid interference with infrared remote controls. Poor quality (or failing) electronic ballasts may have insufficient [[Reservoir capacitor|reservoir capacitance]] or have poor regulation, thereby producing considerable 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz modulation of the light.

===Dimming===
Fluorescent light fixtures cannot be connected to [[dimmer]] switches intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts, and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in the fluorescent tube at low power levels. Dimming installations require a compatible [[dimming ballast]]. These systems keep the cathodes of the fluorescent tube fully heated even as the arc current is reduced, promoting easy [[thermionic emission]] of electrons into the arc stream. [[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFLs]] are available{{clarify|date=November 2016}} that work in conjunction with a suitable{{clarify|date=November 2016}} dimmer.

===Disposal and recycling===
{{Main|Fluorescent lamp recycling}}
The disposal of phosphor and particularly the toxic [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the tubes is an environmental issue. Governmental regulations in many areas require special disposal of fluorescent lamps separate from general and household wastes. For large commercial or industrial users of fluorescent lights, recycling services are available in many nations, and may be required by regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lamprecycle.org/lamprecyclers.shtml LampRecycle.org] Commercial Lighting: Lamp Recyclers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/waste/hazard/wastetypes/universal/lamps/frame.htm EPA.gov] Mercury-Containing Light Bulb (Lamp) Regulatory Framework&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, recycling is also available to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/waste/hazard/wastetypes/universal/lamps/live.htm EPA.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110125603/http://www.epa.gov/waste/hazard/wastetypes/universal/lamps/live.htm |date=January 10, 2010 }} Mercury-Containing Light Bulb (Lamp) Collection and Recycling Programs Where You Live &lt;/ref&gt;

==Lamp sizes and designations==
{{Main|Fluorescent lamp formats}}
Systematic nomenclature identifies mass-market lamps as to general shape, power rating, length, color, and other electrical and illuminating characteristics.

==Other fluorescent lamps==
===Black light===
Blacklights are a subset of fluorescent lamps that are used to provide near [[ultraviolet]] light (at about 360&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength). They are built in the same fashion as conventional fluorescent lamps but the glass tube is coated with a phosphor that converts the short-wave UV within the tube to long-wave UV rather than to visible light. They are used to provoke fluorescence (to provide dramatic effects using [[blacklight paint]] and to detect materials such as urine and certain dyes that would be invisible in visible light) as well as to attract insects to [[bug zapper]]s.{{paragraph}} So-called ''blacklite blue'' lamps are also made from more expensive deep purple glass known as [[Wood's glass]] rather than clear glass. The deep purple glass filters out most of the visible colors of light directly emitted by the mercury-vapor discharge, producing proportionally less visible light compared with UV light. This allows UV-induced fluorescence to be seen more easily (thereby allowing [[blacklight poster]]s to seem much more dramatic). The blacklight lamps used in bug zappers do not require this refinement so it is usually omitted in the interest of cost; they are called simply ''[[blacklite]]'' (and not blacklite blue).

===Tanning lamp===
The lamps used in [[tanning beds]] contain a different phosphor blend (typically 3 to 5 or more phosphors) that emits both UVA and UVB, provoking a [[sun tanning|tanning]] response in most human skin. Typically, the output is rated as 3–10% UVB (5% most typical) with the remaining UV as UVA. These are mainly F71, F72, or F73 HO (100&amp;nbsp;W) lamps, although 160&amp;nbsp;W VHO are somewhat common. One common phosphor used in these lamps is lead-activated barium disilicate, but a europium-activated strontium fluoroborate is also used. Early lamps used [[thallium]] as an activator, but emissions of thallium during manufacture were toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|Sell|2001|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UVB medical lamps===
The lamps used in [[phototherapy]] contain a phosphor that emits only UVB ultraviolet light.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} There are two types: broadband UVB that gives 290–320 nanometer with peak wavelength of 306&amp;nbsp;nm, and narrowband UVB that gives 311–313 nanometer. Because of the longer wavelength, the narrowband UVB bulbs do not cause erytherma in the skin like the broadband. They requires a 10-20 times higher dose to the skin and they require more bulbs and longer exposure time. The narrowband is good for psoriasis, eczema (atopic dermatitis), vitiligo, lichen planus, and some other skin diseases.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The broadband is better for increasing Vitamin D3 in the body.
Philips narrowband lamps are PL-S9W/01, PL-L36W/01 and other powers where the "/01" means narrowband UVB.

===Grow lamp===
[[Grow lamp]]s contain phosphor blends that encourage [[photosynthesis]], growth, or flowering in plants, algae, photosynthetic bacteria, and other light-dependent organisms. These often emit light primarily in the red and blue color range, which is absorbed by [[chlorophyll]] and used for photosynthesis in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goins, GD and Yorio, NC and Sanwo, MM and Brown, CS |title=Photomorphogenesis, photosynthesis, and seed yield of wheat plants grown under red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with and without supplemental blue lighting |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |date=1997 |volume=48 |issue=7|pages=1407–1413 |doi=10.1093/jxb/48.7.1407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrared lamps===
Lamps can be made with a lithium metaluminate phosphor activated with iron. This phosphor has peak emissions between 675 and 875 nanometers, with lesser emissions in the deep red part of the visible spectrum.&lt;ref name="Kane 2001 122"&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|Sell|2001|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bilirubin lamps===
Deep blue light generated from a [[europium]]-activated phosphor is used in the [[light therapy]] treatment of [[jaundice]]; light of this color penetrates skin and helps in the breakup of excess [[bilirubin]].&lt;ref name="Kane 2001 122"/&gt;

===Germicidal lamp===
Similar structure but not fluorescent, [[germicidal lamp]]s depend on the property that spectrum of 254&amp;nbsp;nm kills most germs. Germicidal lamps contain no phosphor at all (making them mercury vapor gas discharge lamps rather than fluorescent) and their tubes are made of [[fused quartz]] that is transparent to the UV light emitted by the mercury discharge. The 254&amp;nbsp;nm UV emitted by these tubes will kill germs and ionize [[oxygen]] to [[ozone]]. In addition it can cause eye and skin damage and should not be used or observed without eye and skin protection. Besides their uses to kill [[Microorganism|germs]] and create ozone, they are sometimes used by [[geologist]]s to identify certain species of [[mineral]]s by the color of their fluorescence. When used in this fashion, they are fitted with filters in the same way as blacklight-blue lamps are; the filter passes the short-wave UV and blocks the visible light produced by the mercury discharge. They are also used in some [[EPROM]] erasers.{{paragraph}} Germicidal lamps have designations beginning with G (meaning ''germicidal''), rather than F, for example G30T8 for a 30-watt, {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter, {{convert|36|in|cm|adj=on}} long germicidal lamp (as opposed to an F30T8, which would be the fluorescent lamp of the same size and rating).

===Electrodeless lamp===
Electrodeless induction lamps are fluorescent lamps without internal electrodes. They have been commercially available since 1990. A current is induced into the gas column using [[electromagnetic induction]]. Because the electrodes are usually the life-limiting element of fluorescent lamps, such electrodeless lamps can have a very long service life, although they also have a higher purchase price.

===Cold-cathode fluorescent lamp===
Cold-cathode fluorescent lamps were used as [[backlighting]] for [[LCD]]s in [[computer monitor]]s and televisions before the use of [[LED-backlit LCD]]s. They are also popular with computer [[case modder]]s in recent years.

==Science demonstrations==
[[File:Fluorescent tube under electric line.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity.|[[Capacitive coupling]] with [[high-voltage power line]]s can light a lamp continuously at low intensity.]]
Fluorescent lamps can be illuminated by means other than a proper electrical connection. These other methods, however, result in very dim or very short-lived illumination, and so are seen mostly in science demonstrations. [[Static electricity]] or a [[Van de Graaff generator]] will cause a lamp to flash momentarily as it discharges a high voltage capacitance. A [[Tesla coil]] will pass high-frequency current through the tube, and since it has a high voltage as well, the gases within the tube will ionize and emit light. This also works with plasma globes. [[Capacitive coupling]] with [[electric power transmission|high-voltage power lines]] can light a lamp continuously at low intensity, depending on the intensity of the electrostatic field, as shown in the image on the right.

[[File:GRE-Logo.png|right|125px]]

'''GRE''' (株式会社　ゼネラル　リサ－チ　オブ　エレクトロニックス ''General Research of Electronics, Inc.'') was a [[Japan]]-based multinational manufacturer of electronics equipment, primarily in the fields of [[radio]] and other [[telecommunications]]. Their products included [[Two-way radio|transceiver]]s, [[Scanner (radio)|radio scanner]]s, [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s, [[GPS]] devices, and satellite equipment. They also produced [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] equipment for other companies, including [[Radio Shack]], [[Uniden]] and [[Commtel]].

GRE was established in 1961, and its headquarters was located in [[Tokyo]]. GRE had a manufacturing facility in [[Chiba Prefecture]] which closed in October 2012. In late 1977, GRE established "GRE America, Inc.", its first overseas operation, with a head office in [[California]]. The company established its second overseas corporation, "GRE (Hong Kong), Ltd.", in 1986.

In October, 2012, their China factory was shuttered and they ceased all production. While there have been some reports that GRE intends to resume business, {{cn|date=December 2015}} without hardware engineers, software engineers, or major customers, it is unlikely that they will ever be able to resume production. GRE America continues to service GRECOM products and to sell and service Alinco radio products for the North American market.

In May, 2013, GRE America Inc (USA Branch) moved from its Belmont, CA location after losing Alinco’s Distribution rights in North American market. GRE America relocated in the City of San Leandro, CA.

In January, 2014, [[Whistler Group]] took over production of GRE's scanner line. Due to several of GRE's engineers working with Whistler, the products produced by the overtaking company are very similar to that of GRE's at the time of operation cessation. Whistler later began selling radio scanners formerly produced for Radio Shack with separate product numbers but identical hardware.

In February, 2014, GRE (Japan) head office closed its Tokyo office and relocated to its Chiba location where they had once produced its product line when it first established back in 1961.

In September 2014 'General Research of Electronics' Japan (GRE) decided cease its USA business operations and closed its California office since there is no active business due to lack of financial resource and  development capabilities at GRE Japan.

The term "'''computer'''", in use from the early 17th century (the first known written reference dates from 1613),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary
|title=computer

|quote=1613   'R. B.' Yong Mans Gleanings 1, I have read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that ever breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant "one who computes": a person performing mathematical [[calculation]]s, before [[computer|electronic computers]] became commercially available.
"The human computer is supposed to be following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate from them in any detail."{{sfnp|Turing|1950}}
Teams of people were frequently used to undertake long and often tedious calculations; the work was divided so that this could be done in parallel. Frequently, the same calculations were performed independently by separate teams to check the correctness of the results.

Since the end of the 20th century, the term "human computer" has also been applied to individuals with prodigious powers of [[Mental calculation|mental arithmetic]], also known as [[mental calculator]]s.

==Origins in sciences==
The approach was taken for [[astronomy|astronomical]] and other complex calculations. Perhaps the first example of organized human computing was by the Frenchman [[Alexis Claude Clairaut]] (1713–1765), when he divided the computation to determine the time of the return of [[Halley's Comet]] with two colleagues, [[Joseph Lalande]] and [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]].{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=22–25}} Human computers were also involved in plotting the future movements of astronomical objects to create celestial tables for [[almanac]]s in the late 1760s.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=29–30}} The computers working on the ''[[The Nautical Almanac|Nautical Almanac]]'' for the British Admiralty included [[William Wales (astronomer)|William Wales]], [[Israel Lyons]] and [[Richard Dunthorne]].{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=30}} The project was overseen by [[Nevil Maskelyne]].{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=29}} Maskelyne would borrow tables from other sources as often as he could in order to reduce the number of calculations his team of computers had to make.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=31}} For some men such as [[Johannes Kepler]], assisting a scientist in computation was a temporary position until they moved on to greater advancements. Women were generally excluded, with some exceptions such as [[Mary Edwards (human computer)|Mary Edwards]] who worked from the 1780s to 1815 as one of thirty-five computers for the British ''[[The Nautical Almanac|Nautical Almanac]]'' used for navigation at sea. The United States also worked on their own version of a nautical almanac in the 1840s, with [[Maria Mitchell]] being one of the best-known computers on the staff.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=61}}

Other innovations in human computing included the work done by a group of boys who worked in the Octagon Room of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Greenwich Observatory]] for Astronomer Royal, [[George Biddell Airy|George Airy]].{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=50}} Airy's computers, hired after 1835, could be as young as fifteen and they were working on a backlog of astronomical data.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=50–51}} The way that Airy organized the Octagon Room with a manager, pre-printed computing forms and standardized methods of calculating and checking results (similar to the way the ''Nautical Almanac'' computers operated) would remain a standard for computing operations for the next 80 years.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=54}}

In the 1870s, the United States [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] created a new way of organizing human computing to track weather patterns.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=77}} This built on previous work from the US Navy and the [[Meteorological intelligence|Smithsonian meteorological project]].{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=76}} The Signal Corps used a small computing staff that processed data that had to be collected quickly and finished in "intensive two-hour shifts".{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=76–77}} Each individual human computer was responsible for only part of the data.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=77}}

Women were increasingly involved in computing after 1865.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=81}} Private companies hired them for computing and to manage office staffs.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=81}}  

In the late nineteenth century [[Edward Charles Pickering]] organized the "[[Harvard Computers]]".{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=82–83}} The first woman to approach them, [[Anna Winlock]], asked Harvard Observatory for a computing job in 1875.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=82}} By 1880, all of the computers working at the Harvard Observatory were women.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=82}} The standard computer pay started at twenty-five cents an hour.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=31}} There would be such a huge demand to work there, that some women offered to work for the Harvard Computers for free.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=105}} Many of the women astronomers from this era were computers with possibly the best-known being [[Florence Cushman]], [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]], and [[Annie Jump Cannon]], who worked with Pickering from 1888, 1893, and 1896 respectively. Cannon could classify stars at a rate of 3 per minute.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} [[Williamina Fleming|Mina Fleming]], one of the Harvard Computers, published "The Draper Catalogue of Stellar Spectra" in 1890.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=37}} The catalogue organized stars by [[spectral line]]s.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=37}} The catalogue continued to be expanded by the Harvard Computers and added new stars in successive volumes.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=181}} 

In 1893, [[Francis Galton|Frances Galton]] created the Committee for Conducting Statistical Inquiries into the Measurable Characteristics of Plants and Animals which reported to the [[Royal Society]].{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=106}} The committee used advanced techniques for scientific research and supported the work of several scientists.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=106}} [[Raphael Weldon|W.F. Raphael Weldon]], the first scientist supported by the committee worked with his wife, Florence Tebb Weldon, who was his human computer.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=106}} Weldon used logarithms and mathematical tables created by Crelle and had no calculating machine.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=106–107}} [[Karl Pearson]], who had a lab at the [[University of London]], felt that the work Weldon did was "hampered by the committee".{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=107–108}} However, Pearson did create a mathematical formula that the committee was able to use which allowed for data correlation.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=108}} Pearson brought his correlation formula to his own Biometrics Laboratory.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=108}} Pearson had volunteer and salaried computers who were both men and women.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=110}} [[Alice Lee (mathematician)|Alice Lee]] was one of his salaried computers who worked with [[histogram]]s and the ''[[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]]'' statistics.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=111}} Pearson also worked with [[Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave|Beatrice]] and [[Frances Cave-Browne-Cave|Frances Cave-Brown-Cave]].{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=111}} Pearson's lab, by 1906, had mastered the art of [[mathematical table]] making.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=111}}

==Mathematical tables==
Human computers were used to compile 18th and 19th century Western European [[mathematical tables]], for example those for [[trigonometry]] and [[logarithm]]s. Although these tables were most often known by the names of the principal [[mathematician]] involved in the project, such tables were often in fact the work of an army of unknown and unsung computers. Ever more accurate tables to a high degree of precision were needed for navigation and engineering. Approaches differed, but one was to break up the project into a form of long distance work from home [[piece work]]. The computers, often educated middle class women who society deemed it unseemly to engage in the professions or go out to work, would receive and send back packets of calculations by post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Campbell-Kelly |editor1-first=Martin |editor2-last=Croarken |editor2-first=Mary |year=2003 |title=The History of Mathematical Tables: From Sumer to Spreadsheets |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O170gWPZ7M8C&amp;pg=PA10 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=10|isbn=0198508417}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Astronomical Society eventually gave space to a new committee, the Mathematical Tables Committee, which was the only professional organization for human computers in 1925.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=173}}

==Fluid dynamics==
Human computers were used to predict the effects of building the [[Afsluitdijk]] in the [[Zuiderzee]]. The computer simulation was set up by [[Hendrik Lorentz]].&lt;ref&gt;Beenakker, C. The Zuiderzee Project, Instituut-Lorenz for Theoretical Physics, University of Leiden. https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/zuiderzee/zuiderzee.html (last accessed November 19, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

A visionary application to meteorology can be found in the scientific work of [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] who, in 1922, estimated that 64,000 humans could forecast the weather for the whole globe by solving the attending differential equations numerically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunt |first=J. C. R. |title=Lewis Fry Richardson and His Contribution to Mathematics, Meteorology and Models of Conflict |journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics |year=1998 |volume=30 |pages=xiii–xxxvi |doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.30.1.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1910 he had already used human computers to calculate the stresses inside a masonry dam.&lt;ref&gt;Roache, Patrick J., ''Verification and validation in computational science and engineering'', Hermosa Publishers, 1998, Albuquerque&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime computing and electronics==
Human computers, both men and women, were involved in calculating ballistics tables during World War I.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=151–152}} In between the two world wars, computers were used in the Department of Agriculture in the United States and also at Iowa State College.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=164}} The human computers in these places also used calculating machines and early electrical computers to aid in their work.{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=166}} In the 1930s, The Columbia University Statistical Bureau was created by [[Benjamin D. Wood|Benjamin Wood]].{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=190}} Organized computing was also established at [[Indiana University]], the [[Cowles Foundation|Cowles Commission]] and the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Research Council]].{{sfnp|Grier|2005|pp=195}}

Human computers played integral roles in the World War II war effort in the United States, and because of the depletion of the male labor force due to the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]], many computers during World War II were women, frequently with degrees in mathematics. In the 1940s, women were hired to example nuclear and particle tracks left on photographic emulsions.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=459}} In the [[Manhattan Project]], human computers, working with a variety of mechanical aids, assisted numerical studies of the complex formulas related to [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref name="Kean"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kean|first=Sam|title=The Disappearing Spoon – and other true tales from the Periodic Table|year=2010|publisher=Black Swan|location=London|isbn=978-0-552-77750-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] used human computers in flight research to transcribe raw data from celluloid film and [[oscillograph]] paper and then, using [[slide rule]]s and electric [[calculator]]s, reduced the data to standard engineering units. [[Margot Lee Shetterly]]'s biographical book, ''[[Hidden Figures (book)|Hidden Figures]]'', documents the contributions of African American women who served as human computers at [[NASA]].&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howell|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Story of NASA's Real 'Hidden Figures'|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-story-of-nasas-real-ldquo-hidden-figures-rdquo/|website=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=January 26, 2017|date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; NACA had begun hiring black women as computers as early as 1940.{{sfnp|Evans|2018|pp=24}} One such computer was [[Dorothy Vaughan]] who began her work in 1943 with the [[Langley Research Center]] as a special hire to aid the WWII effort.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/crgis/images/2/29/VaughanBio.pdf|title=DOROTHY VAUGHAN (nee JOHNSON)|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As electrical computers became more available, human computers, especially women, were drafted as some of the first [[Programmer|computer programmers]].{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=462}} Because the six people responsible for setting up problems on the [[ENIAC]] (the premiere general-purpose electronic digital computer built at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] during World War II) were drafted from a corps of human computers, the world's first professional computer [[programmer]]s were women including [[Kathleen Antonelli|Kay McNulty]], [[Betty Holberton|Betty Snyder]], [[Marlyn Meltzer|Marlyn Wescoff]], [[Ruth Teitelbaum|Ruth Lichterman]], [[Jean Bartik|Betty Jean Jennings]], and [[Frances Spence|Fran Bilas]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated"&gt;[http://www.eniacprogrammers.org/awards.shtml ENIAC Programmers Project – Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414161648/http://www.eniacprogrammers.org/awards.shtml|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human-assisted computation ==

The term "human computer" has been recently used by a group of researchers who refer to their work as "human computation".{{sfnp|Law|von Ahn|2011}} In this usage, "human computer" refers to activities of humans in the context of [[human-based computation]] (HBC). 

This usage is questionable for the following reason. HBC is a computational technique where a machine outsources certain (not necessarily algorithmic) tasks to humans. In fact, most of the time humans in the context of HBC are not provided with a sequence of exact steps that needs to be executed to yield an answer. HBC is agnostic about how humans solve the problem. This is why the term outsourcing is used in the definition. The use of humans as "human computers" in the context of HBC is very rare.

An '''inducement prize contest''' ('''IPC''') is a competition that awards a cash prize for the accomplishment of a feat, usually of engineering. IPCs are typically designed to extend the limits of human ability. Some of the most famous IPCs include the [[Longitude prize]] (1714–1765), the [[Orteig Prize]] (1919–1927) and the prizes from the [[X Prize Foundation]].

IPCs are distinct from recognition prizes, such as the [[Nobel Prize]], in that IPCs have prospectively defined criteria for what feat is to be achieved for winning the prize, while recognition prizes may be based on the beneficial effects of the feat.

Research has shown that IPCs can be extremely effective in pushing the advancement of technology.

==History==
Throughout history, there have been instances where IPCs were successfully utilized to push the boundaries of what would have been considered state-of-the-art at the time.&lt;ref name=wp20140521&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Wadhwa|first1=Vivek |title=The powerful role of incentive competitions to spur innovation |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/05/21/the-powerful-role-of-incentive-competitions-to-spur-innovation/ |accessdate=14 January 2015 |work=Washington Post |date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Longitude Prize was a reward offered by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government for a simple and practical method for the precise determination of a ship's [[longitude]].  The prize, established through an Act of Parliament (the [[Longitude Act]]) in 1714, was administered by the [[Board of Longitude]].
Another example happened during the first years of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  The French government offered a hefty cash award of 12,000 francs to any inventor who could devise a cheap and effective method of preserving large amounts of food. The larger armies of the period required increased, regular supplies of quality food. Limited food availability was among the factors limiting military campaigns to the summer and autumn months. In 1809, a French confectioner and brewer,  [[Nicolas Appert]], observed that food cooked inside a jar did not spoil unless the seals leaked, and developed a method of sealing food in glass jars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association Internationale Nicolas Appert |url=http://www.appert-aina.com|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for lack of spoilage was unknown at the time, since it would be another 50 years before [[Louis Pasteur]] demonstrated the role of microbes in food spoilage.
Yet another example is the Orteig Prize which was a $25,000 reward offered on May 19, 1919, by New York hotel owner [[Raymond Orteig]] to the first allied aviator(s) to fly non-stop from [[New York City]] to [[Paris]] or vice versa. On offer for five years, it attracted no competitors. Orteig renewed the offer for another five years in 1924 when the state of aviation technology had advanced to the point that numerous competitors vied for the prize.  Several famous aviators made unsuccessful attempts at the New York–Paris flight before relatively unknown American [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize in 1927 in his [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''.
     
A leading organization in development and managing IPCs is the X PRIZE Foundation.  Its mission is to bring about "radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity" through incentivized competition. It fosters high-profile competitions that motivate individuals, companies and organizations across all disciplines to develop innovative ideas and technologies that help solve the grand challenges that restrict humanity's progress.  The most high-profile X PRIZE to date was the [[Ansari X PRIZE]] relating to spacecraft development awarded in 2004.  This prize was intended to inspire research and development into technology for space exploration.  Indeed, the X Prize has inspired other "letter" named inducement prize competitions such as the [[H-Prize]], [[N-Prize]], and so forth. In 2006, there was much interest in prizes for automotive achievement, such as the 250 [[Fuel economy in automobiles|mpg]] car.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In Europe there has been a re-emergence of challenge prizes that following in the tradition of the Longitude Prize for solutions which impact on social problems. The Centre for Challenge Prizes based in London is an example of this running prizes for innovations that for example reduce social isolation or make renewable energy generators accessible to off the grid refugees and returnees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/challengeprizes Centre for Challenge Prizes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
In some literature on the subject, it has been stated that well-designed IPCs can garner economic activity on the order of 10 to 20 times the amount of the prize face value.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

{{Unreferenced|date=January 2009}}
An '''intake''' or (for aircraft) '''inlet''' is an opening on a car or aircraft body capturing air for operation of an [[internal combustion engine]].

Because the modern ground vehicle internal combustion engine is in essence a powerful [[air pump]], like the [[exhaust system]] on an engine, the intake must be carefully engineered and tuned to provide the greatest efficiency and [[power (physics)|power]]. An ideal intake system should increase the velocity of the air until it travels into the [[combustion chamber]], while minimizing [[turbulence]] and restriction of flow.

However, in aircraft, particularly supersonic aircraft, the purpose of the intake is to slow and increase the pressure of the air.

== Automobile engine intakes ==
[[File:Mercedes-Benz C 63 AMG Black Series (6143822587).jpg|thumb|Engine intake of a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W204)#C 63 AMG (2011–)|Mercedes-Benz C 63 AMG]]]]
Early automobile intake systems were simple air inlets connected directly to [[Carburetor|carburetors]]. The first air filter was implemented on the 1915 [[Packard]] [[Twin Six]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The modern automobile air intake system has three main parts, an [[air filter]], [[mass flow sensor]], and [[throttle body]]. Some modern intake systems can be highly complex, and often include specially-designed [[Inlet manifold|intake manifolds]] to optimally distribute air and air/fuel mixture to each cylinder.  Many cars today now include a [[Muffler|silencer]] to minimize the noise entering the cabin.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Silencers impede air flow and create [[turbulence]] which reduce total power, so performance enthusiasts often remove them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

All the above is usually accomplished by flow testing on a [[Air flow bench|flow bench]] in the [[cylinder head porting|port]] design stage. Cars with [[turbocharger]]s or [[supercharger]]s which provide pressurized air to the engine usually have highly refined intake systems to improve performance dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Production cars have specific-length air intakes to cause the air to vibrate and buffet{{Dubious|date=May 2011}} at a specific frequency to assist air flow into the combustion chamber.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Aftermarket companies for cars have introduced larger throttle bodies and air filters to decrease restriction of flow at the cost of changing the harmonics of the air intake for a small net increase in power or [[torque]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Aircraft intakes ==
{{main|Components of jet engines#Air intakes}}

With the development of [[jet engines]] and the subsequent ability of aircraft to travel at [[supersonic]] speeds, it was necessary to design inlets to provide the flow required by the engine over a wide operating envelope and to provide air with a high pressure recovery and low distortion. These designs became more complex as aircraft speeds increased to Mach 3.0 and Mach 3.2, design points for the [[XB-70]] and [[SR-71]] respectively. The inlet is part of the fuselage or part of the nacelle.

[[File:Iolair.jpg|thumb|''Iolair'' on [[Elbe]] river in 1990]]
'''''[[Iolair]]''''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] for eagle) is a specialised [[semi-submersible]] offshore platform designed for [[BP]] to support and service [[oil platform]]s in the [[North Sea]] and served as an [[Semi-submersible#Offshore support vessels|emergency support vessel]] (ESV) in the [[Forties Oil Field]]. Since 2000 it has been working in the [[Cantarell Field]], [[Mexico]] as an offshore construction and maintenance service vessel operated by [[Cotemar]] S.A de C.V.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cotemar.com.mx/en/products-services/|title=Products &amp; services – Cotemar|website=cotemar.com.mx|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Particulars==
''Iolair'' is a self-propelled, twin hull, vessel and  operates as a [[Dynamic positioning|dynamically positioned]] (DP) construction support vessel. The vessel can operate up to a water depth of {{convert|488|m|ft}}, is {{convert|102|m|ft}} long and {{convert|51|m|ft}} wide, and has 350&amp;nbsp;beds with single and double occupancy.

This unique vessel did not start as an ESV, but rather as the concept of a maintenance and support vessel (MSV). It was proposed for the Forties oil field, jointly owned by [[Britoil|British National Oil Corporation]] and operated by [[BP]] Petroleum Development Company Ltd in the [[North Sea]]. A particular feature of the design by the Naval Architects was that there was no cross-bracing between the [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]]. Instead, the platform was given extra strength by a box-girder construction and diagonal bracing was arranged from the centre of the platform to the pontoons. This arrangement remained virtually unchanged to the build completion and offered exceptional speed when the vessel was de-ballasted on the surface. The intention was to achieve a rapid response to emergencies, wherever they might be experienced in the North Sea.

As an MSV, the vessel was always conceived to provide accommodation for about 220 persons, [[saturation diving]] facilities, a large workshop, craneage, and [[helicopter]] landing area with hangar and re-fueling. All were still featured in the eventual design but had been enhanced with other features and sophistication much of which was to support the emergency role. ESV incorporated novelty and ideas that were years ahead of their time. Indeed, part of the brief was that she should still be modern ten years after entering service.

The saturation diving system was equipped with an advanced launch and recovery system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vassalos, D. |author2=Dutta, D. |author3=Macgregor, P. | title=An Investigation Into The Dynamics Of The Esv Iolair Wet-Diving Bell During Launch And Recovery | page=OTC 5705-MS | publisher=Offshore Technology Conference, Houston, Texas | url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=OTC-5705-MS&amp;soc=OTC | date=2–5 May 1988 | accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
She was built by [[Scott Lithgow]] in [[Port Glasgow]], and launched on 6 April 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=David Asprey| title=Clydebuilt Ships Database: de IOLAIR built by Scott Lithgow Offshore Port Glasgow | url=http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=18526 | work=Shipping Times | date= | accessdate=11 June 2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her early years, she was based in the BP [[Forties Oil Field]].

In 1995, she was sold to [[United States|U.S.]] drilling company [[Reading &amp; Bates]]. She was to be converted to a workover/well intervention vessel and was stationed [[West of Shetland pipeline#West of Shetland area|West of Shetland]]. The modifications included removal of some of the top structures, removal of the fire-fighting systems, closing of the dive tube and wave [[surge tank]]. However the intended conversion was never carried out and she was heavily involved in the installation of subsea production equipment using Remote Operated Vehicles. She was also heavily involved in the commissioning of the [[Foinaven oilfield|Foinaven]] and [[Schiehallion oilfield|Schiehallion]] floating production vessels.

In 2000 she left the UK oilfields and went to the Bay of Campeche, Mexico, working in the [[Cantarell Field]]. There she carries out construction and platform support work. She was sold in 2001 by [[Transocean]], who had taken over Reading and Bates, then sold to Exeter Marine Ltd. and since 2017 is  owned by Iolair Offshore Pte Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supermarine.sg/international/|title=Super Marine Holdings|website=www.supermarine.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and registered in the [[Marshall Islands]], a long way from her original registered port of [[Dundee]] in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=dnv/&gt;

==Industry firsts==
* Heave/swell compensation in the diving tube to enable operation in rougher weather.
* A ''Citadel'' area to which people could retire and survive if the vessel was engulfed in gas.
* A drenching system to cool exterior surfaces if the vessel was close to a burning platform.   
* The largest capacity and longest range firefighting monitors ever at sea.
* Fixed water-cannon on the after columns to cool the underside of production platforms.

''Iolair'' is assured of its place in history by being the subject of a 28[[Penny|p]] commemorative stamp issued by [[Post Office Ltd.]] on 25 May 1983. This was one of a series of three stamps celebrating British Engineering Achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Engineering Achievements | url=http://postalheritage.org.uk/exhibitions/onlineexhibitions/sotm2006/feb2006 | publisher=The British Postal Museum and Archive | date=February 2006 | accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg in 1439 was the first European to use movable type. Among his many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based [[ink]] for printing books;&lt;ref&gt;Soap, Sex, and Cigarettes: A Cultural History of American Advertising By Juliann Sivulka, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; adjustable molds;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-4/influential-personalities/gutenbergs-invention|title=Gutenberg’s Invention - Fonts.com|author=|date=|website=Fonts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; mechanical movable type; and the use of a wooden [[printing press]] similar to the agricultural [[screw press]]es of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/2569-gutenberg-changed-world.html|title=How Gutenberg Changed the World|author=|date=|website=livescience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike. Gutenberg's method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a [[type metal]] alloy and a [[hand mould#Printing|hand mould]] for casting type. The alloy was a mixture of lead, tin, and [[antimony]] that melted at a relatively low temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast well, and created a durable type.

In [[Renaissance]] Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of [[mass communication]] which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information—including revolutionary ideas—transcended borders, captured the masses in the [[Reformation]] and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in [[literacy]] broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging [[middle class]]. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-[[nationalism]], accelerated by the flowering of the European [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]] to the detriment of [[Latin]]'s status as ''[[lingua franca]]''. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by [[steam-powered]] [[rotary press]]es allowed printing on an [[industry|industrial]] scale, while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.

The use of movable type was a marked improvement on the handwritten manuscript, which was the existing method of book production in Europe, and upon [[woodblock printing]], and revolutionized European book-making. Gutenberg's [[Spread of the printing press|printing technology spread]] rapidly throughout Europe and later the world.

His major work, the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (also known as the 42-line Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.

== Early life ==
[[File:Johannes Gutenberg.jpg|thumb|Gutenberg in a 16th-century copper engraving]]

Gutenberg was born in the German city of [[Mainz]], the youngest son of the [[Patrician_(post-Roman_Europe)#German_cities_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire|patrician]] merchant Friele Gensfleisch zur Laden, and his second wife, Else Wyrich, who was the daughter of a shopkeeper. It is assumed that he was baptized in the area close to his birthplace of [[St. Christoph, Mainz|St. Christoph]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainz.de/WGAPublisher/online/html/default/akah-68qcdx.en.html St. Christopher's] – Gutenberg's baptismal church&lt;/ref&gt; According to some accounts, Friele was a goldsmith for the [[Archbishop of Mainz|bishop at Mainz]], but most likely, he was involved in the cloth trade.&lt;ref name=benz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/english/zeitgum.htm|title=Gutenberg and Mainz|author=Hanebutt-Benz, Eva-Maria|accessdate=2006-11-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211210010/http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/english/zeitgum.htm|archivedate=2006-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg's year of birth is not precisely known, but it was sometime between the years of 1394 and 1404. In the 1890s the city of Mainz declared his official and symbolic date of birth to be June 24, 1400.&lt;ref name="Childress 2008 62"&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Lienhard, technology historian, says "Most of Gutenberg's early life is a mystery. His father worked with the [[ecclesiastic]] mint. Gutenberg grew up knowing the trade of [[goldsmithing]]."&lt;ref name = Lienhard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi753.htm |title=Lienhard, John H |publisher=Uh.edu |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by historian Heinrich Wallau, who adds, "In the 14th and 15th centuries his [ancestors] claimed a hereditary position as ... retainers of the household of the master of the archiepiscopal mint. In this capacity they doubtless acquired considerable knowledge and technical skill in metal working. They supplied the mint with the metal to be coined, changed the various species of coins, and had a seat at the [[Assize Court|assizes]] in forgery cases."&lt;ref name = CE&gt;Wallau, Heinrich. "Johann Gutenberg". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07090a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallau adds, "His surname was derived from the house inhabited by his father and his paternal ancestors 'zu Laden, zu Gutenberg'. The house of Gänsfleisch was one of the patrician families of the town, tracing its lineage back to the thirteenth century."&lt;ref name=CE /&gt; [[patricianship|Patricians]] (the wealthy and political elite) in Mainz were often named after houses they owned. Around 1427, the name ''zu Gutenberg'', after the family house in Mainz, is documented to have been used for the first time.&lt;ref name=benz /&gt;

In 1411, there was an uprising in Mainz against the patricians, and more than a hundred families were forced to leave. As a result, the Gutenbergs are thought to have moved to [[Eltville am Rhein]] (Alta Villa), where his mother had an inherited estate. According to historian Heinrich Wallau, "All that is known of his youth is that he was not in Mainz in 1430. It is presumed that he migrated for political reasons to [[Strasbourg]], where the family probably had connections."&lt;ref name=CE /&gt; He is assumed to have studied at the [[University of Erfurt]], where there is a record of the enrolment of a student called Johannes de Altavilla in 1418—Altavilla is the Latin form of Eltville am Rhein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Henri-Jean|authorlink=Henri-Jean Martin|title=The History and Power of Writing|year=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-50836-6|page=217|chapter=The arrival of print}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dudley|first=Leonard|title=Information revolutions in the history of the West|year=2008|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Northampton, MA|isbn=978-1-84720-790-6|page=78|chapter=The Map-maker's son}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing is now known of Gutenberg's life for the next fifteen years, but in March 1434, a letter by him indicates that he was living in Strasbourg, where he had some relatives on his mother's side. He also appears to have been a goldsmith member enrolled in the Strasbourg [[militia]]. In 1437, there is evidence that he was instructing a wealthy tradesman on polishing gems, but where he had acquired this knowledge is unknown. In 1436/37 his name also comes up in court in connection with a broken promise of marriage to a woman from Strasbourg, Ennelin.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|title=Gutenberg und seine Zeit in Daten (Gutenberg and his times; Timeline)|url=http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/zeitgutb.htm|publisher=[[Gutenberg Museum]]|accessdate=2006-11-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222075141/http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/zeitgutb.htm|archivedate=2006-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the marriage actually took place is not recorded. Following his father's death in 1419, he is mentioned in the inheritance proceedings.

== Printing press ==
[[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|Early wooden printing press, depicted in 1568. Such presses could produce up to 240 impressions per hour.&lt;ref name="Wolf 1974, 67f."&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=67f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Printing press|Spread of the printing press}}

Around 1439, Gutenberg was involved in a financial misadventure making polished metal mirrors (which were believed to capture holy light from religious relics) for sale to pilgrims to [[Aachen]]: in 1439 the city was planning to exhibit its collection of relics from [[Charlemagne|Emperor Charlemagne]] but the event was delayed by one year due to a severe flood and the capital already spent could not be repaid. When the question of satisfying the investors came up, Gutenberg is said to have promised to share a "secret". It has been widely speculated that this secret may have been the idea of printing with [[movable type]]. Also around 1439–40, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] came up with the idea of printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=James|authorlink=James Burke (science historian)|title=Connections|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|year=1978|location=[[London]]|page=101|isbn=0-333-24827-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that the idea came to him "like a ray of light".&lt;ref name=universe&gt;{{cite book|author=Burke, James|title=The Day the Universe Changed|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|year=1985|location=[[Boston]], [[Toronto]]|isbn=0-316-11695-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until at least 1444 Gutenberg lived in [[Strasbourg]], most likely in the St. Arbogast parish. It was in Strasbourg in 1440 that he is said to have perfected and unveiled the secret of printing based on his research, mysteriously entitled ''Aventur und Kunst'' (enterprise and art). It is not clear what work he was engaged in, or whether some early trials with printing from movable type may have been conducted there. After this, there is a gap of four years in the record. In 1448, he was back in Mainz, where he took out a loan from his brother-in-law [[Arnold Gelthus]], quite possibly for a printing press or related paraphernalia. By this date, Gutenberg may have been familiar with [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing; it is claimed that he had worked on copper [[engraving]]s with an artist known as the [[Master of Playing Cards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lehmann-Haupt, Hellmut|title=Gutenberg and the Master of the Playing Cards|location=[[New Haven]]|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1450, the press was in operation, and a [[German language|German]] [[poem]] had been printed, possibly the first item to be printed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klooster|first=John W.|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=978-0-313-34745-0|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was able to convince the wealthy moneylender [[Johann Fust]] for a loan of 800 [[guilder]]s. [[Peter Schöffer]], who became Fust's son-in-law, also joined the enterprise. Schöffer had worked as a scribe in [[Paris]] and is believed to have designed some of the first [[typeface]]s.

Gutenberg's workshop was set up at Hof Humbrecht, a property belonging to a distant relative. It is not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this he borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in 1452. At the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars). There is also some speculation that there may have been two presses, one for the pedestrian texts, and one for the Bible. One of the profit-making enterprises of the new press was the printing of thousands of [[indulgence]]s for the church, documented from 1454 to 1455.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Peter|title=Documents that Changed the World: Gutenberg indulgence, 1454|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2012/11/16/documents-that-changed-the-world-gutenberg-indulgence-1454/|website=UW Today|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1455 Gutenberg completed his ''42-line Bible'', known as the [[Gutenberg Bible]]. About 180 copies were printed, most on paper and some on [[vellum]].

=== Court case ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}
Some time in 1456, there was a dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, and Fust demanded his money back, accusing Gutenberg of misusing the funds. Meanwhile the expenses of the Bible project had proliferated, and Gutenberg's debt now exceeded 20,000 guilders. Fust sued at the archbishop's court. A November 1455 legal document records that there was a partnership for a "project of the books," the funds for which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to Fust. The court decided in favor of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop and half of all printed Bibles.

Thus Gutenberg was effectively bankrupt, but it appears he retained (or re-started) a small printing shop, and participated in the printing of a Bible in the town of [[Bamberg]] around 1459, for which he seems at least to have supplied the type. But since his printed books never carry his name or a date, it is difficult to be certain, and there is consequently a considerable scholarly debate on this subject. It is also possible that the large [[Catholicon (trilingual dictionary)|''Catholicon'' dictionary]], 300 copies of 754 pages, printed in Mainz in 1460, was executed in his workshop.

Meanwhile, the Fust–Schöffer shop was the first in Europe to bring out a book with the printer's name and date, the ''[[Mainz Psalter]]'' of August 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg.

=== Later life ===
In 1462, during the devastating [[Mainz Diocesan Feud]], Mainz was sacked by archbishop [[Adolph II of Nassau|Adolph von Nassau]], and Gutenberg was exiled. An old man by now, he moved to [[Eltville]] where he may have initiated and supervised a new printing press belonging to the brothers Bechtermünze.&lt;ref name=CE /&gt;

In January 1465, Gutenberg's achievements were recognized and he was given the title ''Hofmann'' (gentleman of the court) by von Nassau. This honor included a [[stipend]], an annual court outfit, as well as 2,180 litres of grain and 2,000 litres of wine tax-free.&lt;ref name=sumner2009 /&gt; It is believed he may have moved back to Mainz around this time, but this is not certain.

Gutenberg died in 1468 and was buried in the Franciscan church at Mainz, his contributions largely unknown. This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg's grave is now lost.&lt;ref name=sumner2009 /&gt;

In 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of [[typography]] in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig. It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleon's biography of famous Germans.&lt;ref name=sumner2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sumner|first1=Tracy M.|title=How Did We Get the Bible?|date=2009|publisher=Barbour Publishing|isbn=978-1-60742-349-2|edition=unabridged}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Printed books ==
{{Main|Gutenberg Bible}}
[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|''Gutenberg Bible'', [[Library of Congress]], Washington, D.C.]]

Between 1450 and 1455, Gutenberg printed several texts, some of which remain unidentified; his texts did not bear the printer's name or date, so attribution is possible only from typographical evidence and external references. Certainly several church documents including a papal letter and two indulgences were printed, one of which was issued in Mainz. In view of the value of printing in quantity, seven editions in two styles were ordered, resulting in several thousand copies being printed.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B., Purvis, Alston W.''History of Graphic Design''. Hoboken, N.J: Wiley, 2006. p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; Some printed editions of ''Ars Minor'', a schoolbook on Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus]] may have been printed by Gutenberg; these have been dated either 1451–52 or 1455.

In 1455, Gutenberg completed copies of a beautifully executed folio [[Bible]] (''Biblia Sacra''), with 42 lines on each page. Copies sold for 30 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] each,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cormack, Lesley B. |author2=Ede, Andrew |title=A History of Science in Society: From Philosophy to Utility|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2004|isbn=1-55111-332-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was roughly three years' wages for an average clerk. Nonetheless, it was significantly cheaper than a manuscript Bible that could take a single scribe over a year to prepare. After printing, some copies were rubricated or hand-illuminated in the same elegant way as manuscript Bibles from the same period.

48 substantially complete copies are known to survive, including two at the [[British Library]] that can be viewed and compared online.&lt;ref name=britLibrary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prodigi.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/search.asp|title=Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=[[British Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text lacks modern features such as [[pagination]], [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentations]], and [[paragraph break]]s.

An undated [[36-line Bible|36-line edition of the Bible]] was printed, probably in [[Bamberg]] in 1458–60, possibly by Gutenberg. A large part of it was shown to have been set from a copy of Gutenberg's Bible, thus disproving earlier speculation that it was the earlier of the two.&lt;ref name="Kapr"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapr|first=Albert|title=Johannes Gutenberg: the Man and His Invention|publisher=Scolar Press|year=1996|page=322|isbn=1-85928-114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg's early printing process, and what texts he printed with [[movable type]], are not known in great detail. His later Bibles were printed in such a way as to have required large quantities of type, some estimates suggesting as many as 100,000 individual sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Singer, C.; [[E. Holmyard|Holmyard, E.]]; Hall, A.; Williams, T.|title=A History of Technology, vol.3|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setting each page would take, perhaps, half a day, and considering all the work in loading the press, inking the type, pulling the impressions, hanging up the sheets, distributing the type, etc., it is thought that the Gutenberg–Fust shop might have employed as many as 25 craftsmen.

Gutenberg's technique of making movable type remains unclear. In the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe. Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or a somewhat primitive version has been the subject of considerable debate.

In the standard process of making type, a hard metal punch (made by [[punchcutting]], with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a softer copper bar, creating a ''[[matrix (printing)|matrix]]''. This is then placed into a [[hand mould|hand-held mould]] and a piece of type, or "sort", is cast by filling the mould with molten type-metal; this cools almost at once, and the resulting piece of type can be removed from the mould. The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or [[font]]s. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times. The sorts can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of "movable type". (For details, see [[Typography]].)

[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|left|[[Walk of Ideas|"Modern Book Printing"]] − sculpture commemorating its inventor Gutenberg]]

The invention of the making of types with punch, matrix and mold has been widely attributed to Gutenberg. However, recent evidence suggests that Gutenberg's process was somewhat different. If he used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been nearly identical, with some variation due to miscasting and inking. However, the type used in Gutenberg's earliest work shows other variations.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 2001, the physicist [[Blaise Agüera y Arcas]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] librarian [[Paul Needham (librarian)|Paul Needham]], used digital scans of a Papal bull in the [[Scheide Library]], Princeton, to carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in different parts of the printed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Blaise|last=Agüera y Arcas|author2=Needham, Paul|title=Computational analytical bibliography|booktitle=Proceedings Bibliopolis Conference ''The future history of the book''|publisher=[[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]]|date=November 2002|location=[[The Hague]] ([[Netherlands]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.open2.net/gberg_synopsis.html |title=What Did Gutenberg Invent?|accessdate=Aug 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The irregularities in Gutenberg's type, particularly in simple characters such as the hyphen, suggested that the variations could not have come either from ink smear or from wear and damage on the pieces of metal on the types themselves. Although some identical types are clearly used on other pages, other variations, subjected to detailed image analysis, suggested that they could not have been produced from the same matrix. Transmitted light pictures of the page also appeared to reveal substructures in the type that could not arise from traditional [[punchcutting]] techniques. They hypothesized that the method involved impressing simple shapes to create alphabets in "cuneiform" style in a matrix made of some soft material, perhaps sand. Casting the type would destroy the mould, and the matrix would need to be recreated to make each additional sort. This could explain the variations in the type, as well as the substructures observed in the printed images.

Thus, they speculated that "the decisive factor for the birth of typography", the use of reusable moulds for casting type, was a more progressive process than was previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Adams, James L.|title = Flying Buttresses, Entropy and O-Rings: the World of an Engineer|year = 1991|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]|isbn = 0-674-30688-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggested that the additional step of using the punch to create a mould that could be reused many times was not taken until twenty years later, in the 1470s. Others have not accepted some or all of their suggestions, and have interpreted the evidence in other ways, and the truth of the matter remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Paul W. "The 'first' type of Gutenberg: a note on recent research" in ''The Private Library'', Summer 2004, pp. 86-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miklós Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Page-setting room - c. 1920]]

A 1568 history by [[Hadrianus Junius]] of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster in the 1430s and may have brought some of his equipment from [[Haarlem]] to Mainz. While Coster appears to have experimented with moulds and castable metal type, there is no evidence that he had actually printed anything with this technology. He was an inventor and a goldsmith. However, there is one indirect supporter of the claim that Coster might be the inventor. The author of the [[Cologne Chronicle]] of 1499 quotes [[Ulrich Zell]], the first printer of [[Cologne]], that printing was performed in [[Mainz]] in 1450, but that some type of printing of lower quality had previously occurred in the Netherlands. However, the chronicle does not mention the name of Coster,&lt;ref name="Kapr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juchhoff 1950, 131f."&gt;{{harvnb|Juchhoff|1950|pp=131f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it actually credits Gutenberg as the "first inventor of printing" in the very same passage (fol. 312). The first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471,&lt;ref name="Juchhoff 1950, 131f." /&gt; and the Coster connection is today regarded as a mere legend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_07.html Costeriana]. While the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] had attributed the invention of the printing press to Coster, the more recent editions of the work attribute it to Gutenberg to reflect, as it says, the common consent that has developed in the 20th century.

The 19th-century printer and typefounder [[Fournier Le Jeune]] suggested that Gutenberg was not using type cast with a reusable matrix, but wooden types that were carved individually. A similar suggestion was made by Nash in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;See Nash (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; This remains possible, albeit entirely unproven.

It has also been questioned whether Gutenberg used movable types at all. In 2004, Italian professor Bruno Fabbiani claimed that examination of the 42-line Bible revealed an overlapping of letters, suggesting that Gutenberg did not in fact use movable type (individual cast characters) but rather used whole plates made from a system somewhat like a modern typewriter, whereby the letters were stamped successively into the plate and then printed. However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height.

Although Gutenberg was financially unsuccessful in his lifetime, the printing technologies spread quickly, and news and books began to travel across Europe much faster than before. It fed the growing [[Renaissance]], and since it greatly facilitated scientific publishing, it was a major catalyst for the later [[scientific revolution]].

The capital of printing in Europe shifted to [[Venice]], where visionary printers like [[Aldus Manutius]] ensured widespread availability of the major Greek and Latin texts. The claims of an Italian origin for movable type have also focused on this rapid rise of Italy in movable-type printing. This may perhaps be explained by the prior eminence of Italy in the paper and printing trade. Additionally, Italy's economy was growing rapidly at the time, facilitating the spread of literacy. [[Christopher Columbus]] had a geographical book (printed by movable types) bought by his father. That book is in a Spanish museum. Finally, the city of Mainz was sacked in 1462, driving many (including a number of printers and punch cutters) into exile.

Printing was also a factor in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. [[Martin Luther]]'s  [[95 Theses]] were printed and circulated widely; subsequently he issued [[broadsheet]]s outlining his anti-[[indulgences]] position (certificates of indulgences were one of the first items Gutenberg had printed). The broadsheet contributed to development of the [[newspaper]].

In the decades after Gutenberg, many conservative patrons looked down on cheap printed books; books produced by hand were considered more desirable.

Today there is a large [[antique]] market for the earliest printed objects. Books printed prior to 1500 are known as ''[[incunabula]]''.

There are many statues of Gutenberg in Germany, including the famous one by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] (1837) in Mainz, home to the eponymous [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]] and the [[Gutenberg Museum]] on the history of early printing. The latter publishes the ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', the leading periodical in the field.

The [[Johannisnacht, Mainz|Mainzer Johannisnacht]] commemorates the person Johannes Gutenberg in his native city since 1968.

In 1952, the United States Postal Service issued a five hundredth anniversary stamp commemorating Johannes Gutenberg invention of the movable-type printing press.

In 1961 the Canadian philosopher and scholar [[Marshall McLuhan]] entitled his pioneering study in the fields of print culture, cultural studies, and media ecology, ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]: The Making of Typographic Man''.

Regarded as one of the most influential people in human history, Gutenberg remains a towering figure in the popular image. In 1999, the [[A&amp;E Network]] ranked Gutenberg the No. 1 most influential person of the second millennium on their "Biographies of the Millennium" countdown. In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium.&lt;ref name="Man of the Millenium" /&gt;

In space, he is commemorated in the name of the [[asteroid]] [[777 Gutemberga]].

'''Lamination''' is the technique of [[manufacturing]] a [[Raw material|material]] in multiple layers, so that the composite material achieves improved [[strength of materials|strength]], stability, [[sound insulation]], [[visual appearance|appearance]] or other properties from the use of differing materials. A laminate is a permanently assembled object by [[thermal energy|heat]], [[pressure]], [[welding]], or [[adhesives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Richard|title=Method of laminating multiple layers|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5211792|publisher=Google Patents|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
There are different lamination processes, depending on the type of materials to be laminated. The materials used in laminates can be the same or different, depending on the processes and the object to be laminated. An example of the type of laminate using different materials would be the application of a layer of [[plastic film]]—the "laminate"—on either side of a sheet of [[glass]]—the ''laminated'' subject.

Vehicle windshields are commonly made by laminating a tough plastic film between two layers of glass. This is to prevent shards of glass detaching from the windshield in case it breaks. Plywood is a common example of a laminate using the same material in each layer. Glued and laminated dimensioned timber is used in the construction industry to make wooden beams, [[glued laminated timber|Glulam]], with sizes larger and stronger than can be obtained from single pieces of wood. Another reason to laminate wooden strips into beams is quality control, as with this method each and every strip can be inspected before it becomes part of a highly stressed component.

Electrical equipment such as [[transformer]]s and [[electric motor|motors]] usually use [[electrical steel|steel]] laminations to form the core of [[electromagnetic coil|coils]] used to produce [[magnetic field]]s. The thin laminations reduce the loss due to [[eddy current]]s.

==Building materials==
Examples of laminate materials include [[melamine]] adhesive countertop surfacing and [[plywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RjmKuHpTC6EC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Examples+of+laminate+materials+include+melamine+surfacing+and+plywood&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9joHiktzUAhVE5GMKHcndA_4Q6AEIJDAA|title=An Introduction to Radiation Protection 6E|last=Martin|first=Alan|last2=Harbison|first2=Sam|last3=Beach|first3=Karen|last4=Cole|first4=Peter|date=2012-03-30|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781444146073|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decorative laminate]]s are produced with decorative papers with a layer of overlay on top of the decorative paper, set before pressing them with thermoprocessing into high-pressure decorative laminates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Post-Formed Plastic Laminate?|url=http://deloriectd.com/post-formed-plastic-laminate/|publisher=Delorie Countertops and Doors|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new type of HPDL is produced using real [[wood veneer]] or [[multilaminar veneer]] as top surface.{{fact|date=February 2015}} High-pressure laminates consists of laminates "molded and cured at pressures not lower than 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb per sq in.(70&amp;nbsp;kg per sq cm) and more commonly in the range of 1,200 to 2,000&amp;nbsp;lb per sq in. (84 to 140&amp;nbsp;kg per sq cm).&lt;ref&gt;McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Architecture &amp; Construction&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, low pressure laminate is defined as "a plastic laminate molded and cured at pressures in general of 400 pounds per square inch (approximately 27 atmospheres or 2.8&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;106 pascals).&lt;ref&gt;McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms, 6E, Copyright © 2003 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper===
[[File:Smithsonian Folklife Festival 2011 - PARTICIPANT HOSPITALITY.JPG|thumb|A paper sign that has been laminated so it could be used outdoors]]
[[Corrugated fiberboard]] boxes are examples of laminated structures, where an inner core provides rigidity and strength, and the outer layers provide a smooth surface.

Laminating paper products, such as [[photographs]], can prevent them from becoming creased, faded, water damaged, wrinkled, stained, smudged, abraded, or marked by grease or fingerprints. [[Photo identification]] cards and [[credit card]]s are almost always laminated with plastic film. Boxes and other containers are also laminated using a [[UV coating]]. Lamination is also used in sculpture using wood or resin. An example of an artist who used lamination in his work is the American [[Floyd Shaman]].

Further, laminates can be used to add properties to a surface, usually printed paper, that would not have them otherwise. Sheets of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] impregnated with [[magnetism|ferro-magnetic]] material can allow portable printed images to bond to magnets, such as for a custom bulletin board or a visual presentation. Specially surfaced plastic sheets can be laminated over a printed image to allow them to be safely written upon, such as with [[dry erase]] markers or [[chalk]]. Multiple translucent printed images may be laminated in layers to achieve certain visual effects or to hold [[hologram|holographic]] images. Many printing businesses that do commercial lamination keep a variety of laminates on hand, as the process for bonding many types is generally similar when working with arbitrarily thin material.

==Photo laminators==
Three types of laminators are used most often in digital imaging:
* [[Pouch laminator]]s
* [[Heated roll laminator]]s
* [[Cold roll laminator]]s

==Film types==
Laminate [[plastic film]] is generally categorized into these five categories:
* Standard thermal laminating films
* Low-temperature thermal laminating films
* Heat set (or heat-assisted) laminating films
* Pressure-sensitive films
* Liquid laminate

'''Language-agnostic''' programming or scripting (also called '''language-neutral''', '''language-independent''', or '''cross-language''') is a software development paradigm where a particular language is chosen because of its appropriateness for a particular task (taking into consideration all factors, including ecosystem, developer skill-sets, performance, etc.), and not purely because of the skill-set available within a development team.

For example, a language agnostic Java development team might choose to use Ruby or Perl for some development work, where Ruby or Perl would be more appropriate than Java.

"Cross-Language" in programming and scripting describes a program in which two or more languages must be implemented into the program code alongside the core programming language chosen to write the program. Whether this means including a script as a source, to be used when needed, running code within Language-Independent Virtual Machines such as JVM, or Object Models such as COM to cooperate with each other, or choosing languages that work well together natively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2543971|title=The Challenge of Cross-language Interoperability - ACM Queue|website=queue.acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The magic eye tube (or valve) for tuning radio receivers was invented in 1932 by [[Allen B. DuMont]] (who spent most of the 1930s improving the lifetime of [[cathode ray tube]]s, and ultimately formed the [[DuMont Television Network]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |inventor-first=Allen B. |inventor-last=DuMont |inventorlink=Allen B. DuMont |country-code=US |patent-number=2098231 |title=Cathode ray device |publication-date=May 28, 1932 |issue-date=November 9, 1937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |inventor-first=Allen B. |inventor-last=DuMont |inventorlink=Allen B. DuMont |title=Cathode ray tube |country-code=US |patent-number=2163256 |publication-date=September 18, 1934 |issue-date=June 20, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Weinstein, ''The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television''. Temple University Press, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCA 6E5 from 1935 was the first commercial tube.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert M. Wagner of R.C.A. invented the familiar form of the "magic eye" tuning vacuum tube: {{citation |inventor-first=H. M. |inventor-last=Wagner |title=Tuning indicator tube |country-code=US |patent-number=2051189 |publication-date=June 27, 1935 |issue-date=August 18, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6e5.html Radio Museum: 6E5]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier types were end-viewed (see the EM34), usually with an octal or side-contact base.  Later developments featured a smaller side-viewed noval B9A based all-glass type with either a fan type display or a band display (see the EM84). The end-viewed version had a round cone-shaped fluorescent screen together with the black cap that shielded the red light from the cathode/heater assembly. This design prompted the contemporary advertisers to coin the term magic eye, a term still used.

There was also a sub-miniature version with wire ends (Mullard DM70/DM71, Mazda 1M1/1M3, GEC/Marconi Y25) intended for battery operation, used in one Ever Ready AM/FM battery receiver with push-pull output, as well as a small number of AM/FM mains receivers, which lit the valve from the 6.3V heater supply via a 220 [[ohm]] resistor or from the audio output valve's cathode bias. Some [[reel-to-reel tape recorder]]s also used the DM70/DM71 to indicate recording level, including a transistorized model with the valve lit from the bias-oscillator voltage.

The function of a magic eye can be achieved with modern [[semiconductor]] circuitry and [[optoelectronic]] displays. The high voltages (100 Volts or more) required by these tubes are not present in modern devices, so the magic eye tube is now obsolete.

==Operation==
Magic eye tubes are miniature cathode ray tube, usually with a built-in [[triode]] [[signal amplifier]]. It usually glows bright green, (occasionally yellow in some very old types, e.g., EM4) and the glowing ends grow to meet in the middle as the voltage on a [[control grid]] increases. It is used in a circuit that drives the grid with a voltage that changes with signal strength; as the tuning knob is turned, the gap in the eye becomes narrowest when a station is tuned in correctly.

Internally, the device is a vacuum tube consisting of two plate electrode assemblies, one creating a triode amplifier and the other a display section consisting of a conical-shaped target anode coated with zinc-silicate or similar material. The display section's anode is usually directly connected to the receiver's full positive high tension (HT) voltage, whilst the triode-anode is usually (internally) connected to a control electrode mounted between the cathode and the target-anode, and externally connected to positive HT via a high-value resistor, typically 1 megaohm.

When the receiver is switched on but not tuned to a station, the target-anode glows green due to electrons striking it, with the exception of the area by the internal control-electrode. This electrode is typically 150-200V negative with respect to the target-anode, repelling electrons from the target in this region, causing a dark sector to appear on the display.

The control-grid of the triode-amplifier section is connected to a point where a negative control voltage dependent on signal strength is available, e.g. the AGC line in an AM [[superheterodyne]] receiver, or the limiter stage or FM detector in an FM receiver. As a station is tuned in the triode-grid becomes more negative with respect to the common cathode.

==Use in radios==
[[File:RCA 6G5 Magic eye tube.JPG|thumb|6G5 Magic eye tube]]

The purpose of magic eye tubes in radio sets is to help with accurate tuning to a station; the tube makes peaks in signal strength more obvious by producing a visual indication, which is better than using the ear alone. The eye is especially useful because the [[automatic gain control]] (AGC) action tends to increase the audio volume of a mistuned station, so the volume varies relatively little as the tuning knob is turned. The tuning eye was driven by the AGC voltage rather than the audio signal.

When, in the early 1950s, [[FM band|FM]] radio sets were made available on the UK market, many different types of magic eye tubes were made available, with differing displays, but they all worked the same way. Some had a separate small display to light up indicating a [[stereo]] signal on [[FM band|FM]].

The British Leak company used an EM84 indicator as a very precise tuning-indicator in their Troughline FM tuner series, by mixing the AGC voltages from the two limiter valve grids at the indicator sensing-grid. By this means accurate tuning was indicated by a fully open sharp shadow, whilst off-tune the indicator produced a partially closed shadow.

==Other applications==
Magic eye tubes were used as the recording level indicator for [[tape recorder]]s, and it is also possible to use them (in a specially adapted circuit) as a means of rough frequency comparison as a simpler alternative to [[Lissajous figure]]s.

A magic eye tube acts as an inexpensive uncalibrated (and not necessarily [[Linearity|linear]]) voltage indicator, and can be used wherever an indication of voltage is needed, saving the cost of a more accurate calibrated [[Voltmeter|meter]].

At least one design of [[capacitance meter|capacitance bridge]] uses this type of tube to indicate that the bridge is balanced.

The magic eye tube was also used on the cover of [[My Morning Jacket]]'s 2011 album ''[[Circuital (album)|Circuital]]''. The tube was shown as being almost fully lit.

'''''Modern Inventions''''' is a 1937 American [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[short film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[United Artists]]. The cartoon follows [[Donald Duck]] as he tours the fictional Museum of Modern Marvels. It was directed by [[Jack King (animator)|Jack King]], his first project at the Disney studio, and features original music by [[Oliver Wallace]]. The voice cast includes [[Clarence Nash]] as Donald, [[Billy Bletcher]] as the Robot Butler, [[Adriana Caselotti]] as the Robot Baby Carriage and [[Cliff Edwards]] as the Robot Barber.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029257/ ''Modern Inventions''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Modern Inventions'' pokes fun at [[modern conveniences]]. The scene of Donald in the barber's chair was submitted by [[Carl Barks]] as his first story contribution at Disney.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029257/trivia Trivia] from ''Modern Inventions'' at the Internet Movie Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Donald visits the "Museum of Modern Marvels" which showcases various futuristic electronic appliances and inventions. He uses a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] on a line to get in (this allows him to keep his money and get in as well). Once inside, he is confronted with the "Robot Butler", a robot who takes hats ("Your hat, sir.") After Donald's hat is taken away from him, Donald uses a [[magic trick]] to produce another hat (similar to the way he produces flutes in ''[[The Band Concert]]''). He says, "So!" and continues on his way. He first encounters a robotic hitch-hiker, which activates when he makes driving noises. However, when he laughs at it, it punches him in the face. Next he goes to the wrapping machine, which says "Do not touch" but Donald ignores the sign and hops on. When he pulls a lever, the machine proceeds to grab him in two robotic arms, put transparent wrapping paper around him, and put him in [[ribbon]]s, like a package. He manages to break out by vigorously shaking, and continues exploring.

All the time, Donald has been losing hat after hat to the Robot Butler, making Donald angrier and angrier. Eventually, the Butler chases him through the museum to an automated baby carriage, which Donald hides inside. Donald is given a baby's hat to wear as is rocked as the song "[[Rock-a-bye Baby]]" is played. Donald then begins acting like a baby, sucking his feet, playing with toys offered to him and getting ticked under the chin, and having his feet counted "[[This Little Piggy]] went to market." Donald then begins whining about not getting his milk. The machine gets out a bottle of milk but it hits him in the face instead of going into his mouth, making Donald agitated. The machine begins torturing him with toys and more milk in the face, turning him over and pinning a diaper on his bottom and powdering it.

The Robot Butler is again attracted by Donald's laughing and yanks the baby hat off his head. Donald produces one last hat and goes to the one exhibit he's not yet seen: a self-operating hair makeup chair. Using his "cheat" coin, Donald pays to get his hair done. However, instead of giving him a haircut, it flips him over, removes his hat, and given his bottom a cut, wrapping his rear end in a towel, cutting off his tail feathers, cleaning his bill, coating his face with shoe polish, sifting through his bottom feathers, applying a wet towel to it, slapping his blackened face with a cloth, combing his bottom with a [[comb]], making a gap through it, smoothing it out and finally, giving him a pig tail design. The Robot Butler appears and removes Donald's last hat, which causes Donald to enter an explosive rage.

The '''Ocean Surface Topography Mission''' ('''OSTM''') on the '''Jason-2''' satellite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/ostm.html | title = Ocean Surface Topography from Space | publisher = NASA/JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an international [[Earth observation satellite]] mission that continues the [[sea level|sea surface]] height measurements begun in 1992 by the joint [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]/[[Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales|CNES]] [[TOPEX/Poseidon|TOPEX/Poseidon mission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/topex.html |title=Ocean Surface Topography from Space |publisher=NASA/JPL |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531084646/http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/topex.html |archivedate=2008-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed by the NASA/CNES [[Jason-1|Jason-1 mission]] launched in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/jason-1.html |title=Ocean Surface Topography from Space |publisher=NASA/JPL |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513070927/http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/jason-1.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like its two predecessors, OSTM/Jason-2 uses high-precision ocean [[altimetry]] to measure the distance between the satellite and the ocean surface to within a few centimeters. These very accurate observations of variations in sea surface height—also known as  [[Dynamic sea surface topography|ocean topography]]—provide information about global [[sea level]], the speed and direction of [[ocean current]]s, and heat stored in the ocean.

Jason-2 was built by [[Thales Alenia Space]] using a [[Proteus (satellite)|Proteus]] platform, under a contract from CNES, as well as the main Jason-2 instrument, the Poseidon-3 altimeter (successor to the Poseidon and Poseidon 2 altimeter on-board TOPEX/Poseidon and [[Jason-1]])

Scientists consider the 15-plus-year [[climate]] data record that this mission will extend critical  understanding how ocean circulation is linked to global [[climate change]].

OSTM/Jason-2 was launched at 07:46 [[UTC]] on June 20, 2008, from [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 2|Space Launch Complex 2W]] at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[California]], [[United States|USA]], by a [[Delta II]] 7320 rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ostm/news/ostm-20080620.html |title=NASA Launches Ocean Satellite to Keep a Weather, Climate Eye Open |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft separated from the rocket 55 minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Media/News/706274?l=en |title=Jason-2 successfully launched |publisher=EUMETSAT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116083816/http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Media/News/706274?l=en |archivedate=2008-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now in a {{convert|1336|km|mi|abbr=on}} circular, non-sun-synchronous [[orbit]] at an inclination of 66 degrees to Earth's equator, allowing it to monitor 95 percent of Earth's ice-free ocean every 10 days.  Jason-1 has been moved to the opposite side of Earth and now flies over the same region of the ocean that Jason-2 flew over five days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/features/200904-1.html |title=Tandem Mission Brings Ocean Currents into Sharper Focus |publisher=NASA/JPL |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422221414/http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/features/200904-1.html |archivedate=2009-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jason-1's ground tracks fall midway between those of Jason-2, which are about {{convert|315|km|mi|sp=us}} apart at the equator.  This interleaved tandem mission provides twice the number of measurements of the ocean's surface, bringing smaller features such as ocean eddies into view. The tandem mission also helps pave the way for a future ocean altimeter mission that would collect much more detailed data with its single instrument than the two Jason satellites now do together.

With OSTM/Jason-2, ocean altimetry makes the transition from research into operational mode. Responsibility for collecting these measurements moves from the space agencies to the world’s weather and climate forecasting agencies, which use them for short-range, seasonal, and long-range weather and climate forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumetsat.int/home/main/media/news/708051=en |title=NOAA takes over Jason-2 satellite operations |publisher=EUMETSAT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615073539/http://www.eumetsat.int/home/main/media/news/708051%3Den |archivedate=2011-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science objectives==
* Extend the time series of ocean surface topography measurements beyond TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 to accomplish two decades of observations
* Provide a minimum of three years of global ocean surface topography measurement
* Determine the variability of ocean circulation at decadal time scales from combined data record of TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1
* Improve the measure of the time-averaged ocean circulation
* Improve the measure of global sea-level change
* Improve open ocean tide models

==Ocean altimetry==
Spaceborne radar altimeters have proven to be superb tools for mapping ocean-surface topography, the hills and valleys of the sea surface. These instruments send a microwave pulse to the ocean’s surface and time how long it takes to return. A [[microwave radiometer]] corrects any delay that may be caused by [[water vapor]] in the [[atmosphere]]. Other corrections are also required to account for the influence of electrons in the [[ionosphere]] and the dry air mass of the atmosphere. Combining these data with the precise location of the spacecraft makes it possible to determine sea-surface height to within a few centimetres (about one inch). The strength and shape of the returning signal also provides information on wind speed and the height of ocean waves. These data are used in ocean models to calculate the speed and direction of [[ocean current]]s and the amount and location of heat stored in the ocean, which, in turn, reveals global [[climate variation]]s.

==Atomic clock synchronization==
Another payload aboard Jason-2 is the T2L2 (Time Transfer by Laser Link) instrument. T2L2 is used to synchronize atomic clocks at ground stations, and to calibrate the on-board clock of the Jason-2 DORIS instrument. On 6 November 2008 [[CNES]] reported the T2L2 instrument was working well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnes.fr/web/CNES-en/7003-t2l2-ready-to-put-einstein-s-theory-to-the-test.php |title=T2L2 ready to put Einstein’s theory to the test |date=6 November 2008 |publisher=CNES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint effort==
[[Image:OSTM-Jason-2-Spacecraft.jpg|thumb|Jason 2 just before launch.]]
OSTM/Jason-2 is a joint effort by four organizations.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission participants are:
* [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)
* [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] ([[NASA]])
* France’s [[CNES|Centre National d’Études Spatiales]] (CNES)
* [[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites]] (EUMETSAT)

CNES provided the spacecraft, NASA and CNES jointly provided the payload instruments and NASA's Launch Services Program at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] was responsible for the launch management and countdown operations. After completing the on-orbit commissioning of the spacecraft, CNES handed over operation and control of the spacecraft to NOAA in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-238l=en |title=New Oceanography Mission Data Now Available |publisher=NASA/JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNES will process, distribute and archive the research-quality data products that will become available in 2009. EUMETSAT will process and distribute operational data received by its ground station to users in Europe and will archive the data. NOAA will process and distribute operational data received by its ground stations to non-European users and archive that data along with the CNES data products. NOAA and EUMETSAT will generate the near-real-time products and distribute them to users.

NASA will evaluate the performance of its instruments: the advanced microwave radiometer, the Global Positioning System payload, and the laser retroreflector assembly. In addition, NASA and CNES will validate scientific data products. NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, California, manages the mission for NASA's [[Science Mission Directorate]] in Washington.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their 15-year data record of ocean surface topography has provided the first opportunity to observe and understand the global change of ocean circulation and sea level. The results have improved the understanding of the role of the ocean in climate change and improved weather and climate predictions. Data from these missions are used to improve ocean models, forecast hurricane intensity, and identify and track large ocean/atmosphere phenomena such as [[El Niño]] and La Niña. The data are also used every day in applications as diverse as routing ships, improving the safety and efficiency of offshore industry operations, managing fisheries and tracking marine mammals.

Some of the areas in which TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason 1-have made major contributions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/jason-2.pdf | title =The Legacy of Topex/Poseidon and Jason 1, page 30. Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason 2 Launch Press Kit, June 2008 | publisher = NASA/JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to which OSTM/Jason-2 will continue to add, are:
* Ocean Variability

The missions revealed the surprising variability of the ocean, how much it changes from [[season]] to season, year to year, decade to decade and on even longer time scales. They ended the traditional notion of a quasi-steady, large-scale pattern of global ocean circulation by proving that the ocean is changing rapidly on all scales, from huge features such as El Nino and La Nina, which can cover the entire equatorial Pacific, to tiny [[eddies]] swirling off the large [[Gulf Stream]] in the Atlantic.
* Sea Level Change

Measurements by TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 show that mean sea level has been rising by about three millimeters (.12&amp;nbsp;inches) a year since 1993. This is about twice the estimates from tide gauges for the previous century, indicating a possible recent acceleration in the rate of sea level rise.

The data record from these altimetry missions has given scientists important insights into how global sea level is affected by natural climate variability, as well as by human activities.
* Planetary Waves

TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 made clear the importance of planetary-scale [[ocean surface wave|waves]], such as [[Rossby wave|Rossby]] and [[Kelvin wave]]s. No one had realized how widespread these waves are. Thousands of kilometers wide, these waves are driven by [[wind]] under the influence of Earth’s rotation and are important mechanisms for transmitting climate signals across the large ocean basins. At high latitudes, they travel twice as fast as scientists believed previously, showing the ocean responds much more quickly to climate changes than was known before these missions.
* Ocean Tides

The precise measurements of TOPEX/Poseidon’s and Jason-1 have brought knowledge of ocean [[tide]]s to an unprecedented level. The change of water level due to tidal motion in the deep ocean is known everywhere on the globe to within 2.5 centimeters (one inch). This new knowledge has revised notions about how tides dissipate. Instead of losing all their energy over shallow seas near the coasts, as previously believed, about one third of tidal energy is actually lost to the [[deep ocean]]. There, the energy is consumed by [[mixed layer|mixing water of different properties]], a fundamental mechanism in the physics governing the general circulation of the ocean.
* Ocean Models

TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 observations provided the first global data for improving the performance of the numerical ocean models that are a key component of climate prediction models.

==Data use and benefits==

The mission's first validated data products in support of improved weather, climate and ocean forecasts are now being distributed to the public within a few hours of observation. Beginning in 2009, other data products for climate research will be available a few days to a few weeks after observations are taken by the satellite.

Altimetry data have a wide variety of uses from basic scientific research on climate to ship routing. Applications include:

*[[Climatology|Climate research]]: Altimetry data are incorporated into computer models to understand and predict changes in the distribution of heat in ocean, a key element of climate.
*[[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]] forecasting: Understanding the pattern and effects of climate cycles such as El Niño helps predict and mitigate the disastrous effects of floods and drought.

[[Image:Wilma oct24 11am.jpg|thumb|Altimetry reveals the ocean heat that can fuel hurricanes.]]

*[[Tropical cyclone]] forecasting: Altimeter data and satellite ocean wind data are incorporated into atmospheric models for hurricane season forecasting and individual storm severity.
*[[Shipping route|Ship routing]]: Maps of currents, eddies, and vector winds are used in commercial shipping and recreational yachting to optimize routes.
*[[Oil platform|Offshore industries]]: Cable-laying vessels and offshore oil operations require accurate knowledge of ocean circulation patterns, to minimize impacts from strong currents.
*Marine mammal research: [[Sperm whale]]s, [[fur seal]]s, and other marine mammals can be tracked, and therefore studied, around ocean eddies where nutrients and plankton are abundant.
*[[Fisheries management]]: Satellite data identify ocean eddies which bring an increase in organisms that comprise the marine [[food web]], attracting fish and fishermen.
*[[Coral reef]] research: Remotely sensed data are used to monitor and assess [[coral reef]] ecosystems, which are sensitive to changes in ocean temperature.
*[[Marine debris]] tracking: Altimetry can help locate hazardous materials such as floating and partially submerged [[fishing net]]s, timber, and ship debris.

==Future==

The fourth spacecraft to be part of the Ocean Surface Topography Mission is [[Jason-3]]. Like its predecessors, the primary instrument aboard Jason-3 is a [[radar altimeter]]. Additional instruments include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/jason3/ "Jason-3 Missions Summary"] ''Jet Propulsion Laboratory''. Retrieved 25 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Paul Alfred Biefeld was born in [[Jöhstadt]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Germany]] on March 22, 1867. He was the son of Heinrich and Wilhelmina (Glaeser) Biefeld, he moved to the [[United States]] in 1881. Biefeld received his B.S. in [[Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1894. He received his Ph.D. at the [[University of Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in 1900.

He married Emma Bausch, of [[Frankfurt am Main]], on 11 April 1900. He was the Assistant Principal of Appleton Wisconsin high school 1894-1897. Paul was the lab assistant in [[Physics]] and [[Electrical Engineering]] at the [[ETH Zürich]], 1899 &amp;ndash; 1900. Biefeld was the professor of Physics and Electrical Engineering at the [[Hildburghausen Technikum]], Germany 1900 &amp;ndash; 1906. He was also the professor of Physics and [[Astronomy]] at the [[University of Akron]], [[Akron, Ohio]] in 1906 and continued until 1911. He arrived at [[Denison University]] in 1911 where he was the professor and lecturer of Astronomy and the Director of the [[Warner and Swasey Observatory]]. He continued to teach at Denison University and lived in [[Granville, Ohio]] until his death in June 1943.

Biefeld joined the [[Yerkes Observatory|Yerkes]] [[Eclipse]] Expedition to [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1918. He was the research assistant at the [[Yerkes Observatory]] for the summer of 1919. Biefeld was part of the Yerkes Eclipse Expedition to [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] in September 1923.

==In popular culture==

===Biefeld–Brown effect===
In popular culture Biefeld's name has come to be associated with the [[Biefeld–Brown effect]], an electrical effect where extremely high voltages can produce a type of propulsion, usually attributed an [[ionic wind]] but also associated with several [[anti-gravity]] theories. The effect was named by inventor [[Thomas Townsend Brown]], a former student of Biefeld at [[Denison University]] in [[Ohio]]. Brown claimed Biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter although he seems to have named this effect many years after his association with Biefeld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alienscientist.com/brown.html alienscientist.com, Biefeld-Brown Effect Controversy, Tajmar ESA Experiments]&lt;/ref&gt; Brown only attended Denison University for one year and their records show no evidence of any research or experiments being carried out by Biefeld/Brown during Biefeld's professorship there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/13_NFTRH_3_hemadethingsup.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Paraellel Universe of T. Townsend Brown, 2005-2006-2007-2008 - Tanglewood Books, Chapter 13: Notes from the Rabbit Hole #3: "He Made Things Up" (online excerpts)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown himself seemed to think the effect demonstrated a connection between electricity and gravity, which he thought was being negated by the high voltage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/13_NFTRH_3_hemadethingsup.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Paraellel Universe of T. Townsend Brown, 2005-2006-2007-2008 - Tanglewood Books, Chapter 13: Notes from the Rabbit Hole #3: "He Made Things Up" (online excerpts)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association with Albert Einstein===
Publications promoting the Biefeld–Brown effect/[[Electrogravitics]]/anti-gravity tend to emphasize Paul Biefeld's standing as a physicist via titling him a "colleague of [[Albert Einstein]]", based on the fact that Biefeld and Einstein attended ETH Zürich at the same time. Later in life Biefeld recounted that Einstein borrowed his class notes but there is little evidence of anything more than a passing acquaintance between the two students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/12_biefeld-brown.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Paraellel Universe of T.

[[File:Photobooth in Bicester 2001.JPG|thumb|A Snap Digital Imaging booth in the UK]]
A '''photo booth''' is a [[vending machine]] or modern [[kiosk]] that contains an automated, usually [[currency detector|coin-operated]], camera and film processor. Today, the vast majority of photo booths are digital.

== History ==
[[File:Photoautomat 12.jpg|thumb|A photo booth in a public building in Germany]]
The patent for the first automated photography machine was filed in 1888 by William Pope and Edward Poole of Baltimore. The first known really working photographic machine was a product of the French inventor T. E. Enjalbert (March 1889). It was shown at the 1889 World's Fair in Paris. The German-born photographer Mathew Steffens from Chicago filed a patent for such a machine in May 1889. These early machines were not reliable enough to be self-sufficient. The first commercially successful automatic photographic apparatus was the "Bosco" from inventor Conrad Bernitt of Hamburg (patented July 16, 1890). All of these early machines produced ferrotypes. The first photographic automate with negative and positive process was invented by Carl Sasse (1896) of Germany.

The modern concept of photo booth with (later) a curtain originated with [[Anatol Josepho]] (previously Josephewitz), who had arrived in the U.S. from Russia in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3671736/The-history-of-the-photobooth.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Näkki | last=Goranin | title=The history of the photobooth | date=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first photo booth appearing 1925 on Broadway in [[New York City]]. For 25 cents, the booth took, developed and printed 8 photos, a process taking roughly 10 minutes. In the first six months after the booth was erected, it was used by 280,000 people. The Photomaton Company was created to place booths nationwide. On March 27, 1927, Josepho was paid $1 million and guaranteed future royalties for his invention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c0AuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=a9gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5223,2403741&amp;dq=anatol+josepho&amp;hl=en "Photo-in-slot Inventor Will Endow Genius"], ''Miami Daily News'', March 28, 1927, p15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Passport photo booths ==
Most of the photo booths are used for [[passport photo]]s. They are coin-operated automated machines that are designed to print photo in specific format that meets the passport photo requirements. Multiple copies can be printed so users can save some for future uses.

Traditionally, photo booths contain a seat or bench designed to seat the one or two patrons being photographed. The seat is typically surrounded by a curtain of some sort to allow for some privacy and help avoid outside interference during the photo session. Once the payment is made, the photo booth will take a series of photographs, although most modern booths may only take a single photograph and print out a series of identical pictures.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Before each photograph, there will be an indication, such as a light or a buzzer, that will signal the patron to prepare their pose. After the last photograph in the series (typically between 3 and 8) has been taken, the photo booth begins developing the film — a process that used to take several minutes in the old "wet chemistry" booths, but is now typically accomplished in about 30 seconds with digital technology. The prints are then delivered to the customer. Typical dimensions of these prints vary. The classic and most familiar arrangement from the old style photo booths is four pictures on a strip about 40&amp;nbsp;mm wide by 205&amp;nbsp;mm long; digital prints tend to have a square arrangement of two images above two images.

Both black and white and colour photo booths are common in the US, however in Europe the colour photo booth has almost entirely replaced black and white booths. However, newer digital booths now offer the customer the option of whether to print in colour or in black and white. Most modern photo booths use video or digital cameras instead of film cameras, and are under computer control. Some booths can also produce stickers, postcards, or other items with the photographs on them, rather or as well as simply a strip of pictures. These often include an option of novelty decorative borders around the photos.

==Photo sticker booths==
'''Photo sticker booths''' or '''photo sticker machines''' originated from Japan, are a special type of photo booth that produce photo stickers. Still maintaining huge popularity in Japan, they have spread throughout Asia to Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, China, Vietnam, and Thailand. They have also been imported to Australia. Some have also begun appearing in the United States and Canada although they failed to make any impression in Europe when introduced in the mid 1990s.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[File:Purikura Booth 2.JPG|thumb|A ''purikura'' photo booth in Fukushima, Japan]]
In Japan, {{nihongo|'''''purikura'''''|プリクラ}} refers to a photo sticker booth or the product of such a photo booth. The name is a shortened form of the registered trademark {{nihongo|''Purinto Kurabu''|[[:ja:プリント倶楽部|プリント倶楽部]]}}. The term derives from the English ''print club''. Jointly developed by [[Atlus]] and [[Sega]], the first ''purikura'' machines were sold in July 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Terashita | first = Naotaka | last2 = Kudo | first2 = Hiroyuki | date = 1998 | script-title = ja:“プリクラ”ブームを作った人々 | trans-title = The people who made a "purikura" boom | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ieejjournal1994/118/2/118_2_85/_pdf | format = PDF | language = Japanese | journal = The Journal of The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 85–87 | doi = 10.1541/ieejjournal.118.85 | name-list-format = vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The booths were brought out in the U.S. and Europe in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Tidbits... |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=97 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1997|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''purikura'' machines were developed in response to young women's interest in both photography and stickers.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Laura. 2003.“Graffiti photos: Expressive art in Japanese girls’ culture.” ''Harvard Asia Quarterly'', Vol. 7 No. 3, pp. 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation===
After money has been inserted in the machine, multiple customers can enter the booth and pose for a set number of exposures. Some common options include the ability to alter lighting and backdrops while the newest versions offer features such as cameras from a variety of angles, fans, seats, and [[Chroma key|blue screen]] effects. Some establishments even offer costumes and wigs for customers to borrow.

Once the pictures have been taken, the customers select the pictures that they wish to keep and customize them using a [[touch screen]] or [[Tablet computer|pen-sensitive]] screen. The touch screen then displays a vast array of options such as virtual stamps, pictures, clip art, colorful backdrops, borders, and pens that can be superimposed on the photographs.

Features that can be found in some sticker machines are customizing the beauty of the customers such as brightening the pictures, making the eyes sparkle more, changing the hair, bringing a more reddish color to the lips, and fixing any blemishes by having them blurred. Other features include cutting out the original background and replacing it with a different background. Certain backgrounds may be chosen so when the machine prints out the picture, the final sticker will be shiny with sparkles.

Finally, the number and size of the pictures to be printed are chosen, and the pictures print out on a glossy full-color 10 &amp;times; 15&amp;nbsp;cm sheet to be cut up and divided among the group of customers. Some photo booths also allow the pictures to be sent to customers' mobile phones. Other photo places have a scanner and laptop at the cashiers desk for customers to scan and copy their original picture before they cut and divide the pictures amongst their group.

==Photo booths for parties==
Photo booth rental companies allow a person to rent a photo booth for a short period of time (usually in hours) for a fee. Photo booth rentals have become popular in the United States primarily for [[wedding reception]]s, [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteen]] parties, [[Bar Mitzvah|Bar]] and [[Bat Mitzvah]] parties, along with a growing number of other public and private events. In addition to the photo booth and the printing of unlimited photo strips, rental companies usually include a photo booth attendant to service the photo booth and to help guests construct the guest book of photo strips. Online image hosting, compact disks containing the images and related merchandise are readily available. Celebrities are frequent users of photo booths in parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kardashians-pose-up-stunning-photobooth-6767575|title=The Kardashian beauties posed for the camera at Kendall's 20th birthday party|first=Rachael|last=Moon|date=4 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3308012/Kylie-Jenner-boyfriend-Tyga-share-smooch-photo-booth-Kris-s-1920s-themed-birthday-party.html|title=Kylie Jenner and Tyga smooch in photo booth at Kris's birthday party|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Photo printed from Chanel event in Singapore, Dec 2013.jpg|thumb|A photo printed from a Chanel event in Singapore in 2013]]
Apart from traditional photo printing, modern photo booths may also include the following new functions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.co/evolution-photo-booth-2015-10 |title=How Photo Booth Technology Has Improved Over the Years |publisher=Tech.co |date=2015-10-30 |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Animated GIF]]
* [[Flip book]] printing
* Virtual props, placed intelligently on the person's eyes or shoulders etc.
* Slow-motion video
* [[Chroma key|Green-screen background removal]]
* Fun costume virtual dressing
* Games - mostly [[Kinect]] body gesture controlled games, and print a photo of the person and his/her scores
* Facial gesture recognition

== Growth of photo booth rentals ==
As digital cameras, compact photo printers, and flat screen computer monitors became widely available in the early 2000s, people connected these together using a personal computer and software and created their own photo booths. Entrepreneurs began renting machines built along these lines at weddings and parties and the idea spread.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestphotobooths.ca/photo-booth-vs-photographer.html|title=Photo Booth vs Photographer|website=BestPhotoBooths|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 to 2012, interest in the United States for photo booth rentals grew significantly. By 2016 more people were searching for photo booth rentals than DJ rentals in 15 of North America's largest cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forevercaptured.ca/infographic|title=Infographic - Demand for Photo Booths, DJ Services &amp; Wedding Photographers in US &amp; Canada Top Cities|website=www.forevercaptured.ca|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photo booth rentals have also become popular in other countries such as Canada, Australia, and the UK.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; So far in 2016 there is an average of 226,000 monthly searches for a photo booth globally, this has risen by 48.9% since 2015 (In the UK alone this is nearly 20,000 searches a month) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.photobooths.co.uk/blog/photo-booth-statistics-2016/|title=Infographic - Photo Booth Numbers for 2016|website=Photobooths|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3D Selfie Photo Booths ===

[[File:Fantasitron photo booth at Madurodam can scan up to two people at a time IMG 3797 FRD.jpg|thumb|180px|Fantasitron 3D selfie photo booth at [[Madurodam]]]]

A 3D selfie photo booth such as the Fantasitron located at [[Madurodam]], the miniature park, generates [[3D selfie]] models from 2D pictures of customers. These selfies are often printed by dedicated 3D printing companies such as [[Shapeways]]. These models are also known as 3D portraits, 3D figurines or mini-me figurines.

'''Photosensitive glass''', also known as photostructurable glass (PSG), or photomachinable glass, is a crystal-clear [[glass]] that belongs to the lithium-silicate family of glasses, in which an image of a mask {{clarify|date=March 2014}} can be captured by microscopic metallic particles in the glass when it is exposed to short wave radiations such as ultraviolet light.&lt;ref name = "glass fab1"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0167-9317(95)00295-2 | volume=30 | title=Fabrication technologies for microsystems utilizing photoetchable glass | journal=Microelectronic Engineering | pages=497–504| year=1996 | last1=Dietrich | first1=T.R | last2=Ehrfeld | first2=W | last3=Lacher | first3=M | last4=Krämer | first4=M | last5=Speit | first5=B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Photosensitive glass was first discovered by [[S. Donald Stookey]] in 1937.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"&gt;Paul, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="june1"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, pp. 194–209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="glassfacts1"&gt;Maluf, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Photosensitive glass was invented in November 1937 by [[S. Donald Stookey|Dr. Donald Stookey]] of the [[Corning Glass Works]].&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="june1"/&gt; It was not announced publicly until ten years later on June 1, 1947.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="june1"/&gt; It was officially patented in 1950 by Stookey as U.S. Pat. No. 2,515,937 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,515,943 with gold microscopic particles&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt; and marketed under the trade name PhotoCor(R).

==Exposure process==
When the glass is exposed to UV light in the wavelength range 280–320&amp;nbsp;nm, a [[latent image]] is formed. The glass remains transparent at this stage, but its absorption in the uv range of the spectrum increases. This increased absorption is only detectable using uv transmission spectroscopy.&lt;ref name = "glass fab2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/khalidtantawi/photosensitive-glass|title=Photodefinable Glass Processing - khalidtantawi|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason behind this is suggested to be an [[oxidation reduction reaction]] that occurs inside the glass during exposure in which cerium ions are oxidized to a more stable state and silver ions are reduced to silver.&lt;ref name = "glass fab2"/&gt;

==Post-exposure heat treatment==
When the glass is heated to temperatures in the range 550–560&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name = "glass fab3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0960-1317/21/1/017001/refs|title=Processing of photosensitive APEX glass structures with smooth and transparent sidewalls by Khalid H Tantawi, Janeczka Oates, Reza Kamali, Nathan Bergquist and John D Williams, Journal of Micromech. &amp; Microeng. 21 (2011)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for several hours the latent image is converted to a visible image through photoexcitation.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="glassfacts1"/&gt; Exposure through photographic negatives permits the development of three-dimensional color images and photographs.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="glassfacts1"/&gt;  This heat treatment is done in two stages: the temperature is first raised to about 500&amp;nbsp;°C to allow for the completion of the oxidation-reduction reaction, and formation of silver nanoclusters. In the following stage, when the temperature is raised to 550–560&amp;nbsp;°C, a new material (lithium metasilicate) with the formula (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) forms on the silver nanoclustors, this material forms in the crystalline phase.&lt;ref name = "glass fab3"/&gt;

==HF chemical etching==
The lithium metasilicate that forms in the exposed regions of the glass has the unique property of being strongly etched in [[Hydrofluoric Acid|hydrofluoric acid (HF)]]. Hence allowing a three-dimensional image of the mask to be produced, the resulting glass microstructures have a surface roughness in the range 5 μm&lt;ref name = "glass fab1"/&gt; to 0.7 μm.&lt;ref name = "glass fab3"/&gt;

== X-ray sensitive glasses ==
As stated above radiation produces some direct and indirect measurable changes in the glasses. In some cases, the effect is readily observable immediately upon irradiation. In other cases, thermal treatment is required to bring about the observed changes. On the whole, the result of the mentioned reactions will be atomic silvers and/or silver clusters which act as nucleant for precipitation of lithium-meta-silicate during post heat-treatment of irradiated glass and  Similar to other glass-ceramic systems, the more nucleation sites leads to more reduction of crystallization temperature and finer crystalline size. Therefore, to attain the above-mentioned condition, various energetic radiation such as UVand laser beam and  x  γ  and proton  and  radiations have been used for different photosensitive glasses until now.

Photosensitive glass is used in printing and reproducing processes.&lt;ref name=" photosensitive1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gafferglass.com/technical/photosensitive_main.htm |title= Photosensitive Glasses |accessdate= 2008-08-15 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828041509/http://www.gafferglass.com/technical/photosensitive_main.htm |archivedate= 2008-08-28 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photosensitive glass is like traditional camera film except that it reacts to ultraviolet (UV) light, where camera film responds to visible light.&lt;ref name ="glassfacts1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"&gt;Parker, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal wavelength to use for exposure should be between 300 and 350&amp;nbsp;nm, with 320&amp;nbsp;nm being optimum.&lt;ref name =" photosensitive1"/&gt;

Photosensitive glass contains microscopic metallic particles.&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt; These microscopic metallic ion nanoparticles are made of gold or silver which is responsible for the refractive index change.&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt; Photosensitive glass is similar to photographic film. Photographic film uses chemicals, while photosensitive glass
uses gold or silver ions in the material that will respond to the action of light.&lt;ref name =" photosensitive1"/&gt; The process is to pass light of the ultraviolet wavelength through a negative on the glass.&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt; Photographic resolution can be obtained with adhesive polyester as a reverse negative, however anything which resists UV light can act as a "negative."&lt;ref name =" photosensitive1"/&gt;

The glass is sensitive to light that when passes through a mask can ultimately turn it into a permanent picture with a heat process "fixing" permanently the image.&lt;ref name ="glassfacts1"/&gt;&lt;ref name =" photosensitive1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt; Silver glass "latent images" will develop in 3–4 hours at 886–976&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref name =" photosensitive1"/&gt;
Gold glass "latent images" require a higher temperature of 968–1058&amp;nbsp;°F and over a similar period of time for postbaking.&lt;ref name =" photosensitive1"/&gt; Postbaking hastens the occurrence of the particles with the shadow areas of the negative, permitting deeper penetration into the glass than the highlighted areas.&lt;ref name =" photosensitive1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt; This gives the picture three dimensions and color.&lt;ref name =" photosensitive1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt;

The photograph is developed by heating the photosensitive glass around 1000&amp;nbsp;°F for several hours after exposure.&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt; The glass itself is photosensitive and produces a three-dimensional image.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt; Particles that are invisible to the naked eye (i.e. gold or silver) are in the glass. These microscopic particles move and grow when heated to form the photographic image itself.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt; The process is similar to camera film, however a "negative" is placed on top of the photosensitive glass and then exposed to ‘’’ultraviolet’’’ light. Camera film, of course, would be exposed to ordinary visible light. Then there is a special process for the exposed photosensitive glass. The glass is reheated then in a [[kiln]] and postbaked for several hours. The image then "appears" within the special exposed glass as if by magic. The heated piece of photosensitive glass is then allowed to cool down and the process is done. The positive images produced within photosensitive  glass comes in a variety of colors.

As a material for the hot glass studio artist, an additional method of producing imagery in an object using photosensitive glass is to first blow an extremely thin rondel (cased or otherwise) which is annealed in the typical manner.  That rondel is then cut into sections which are exposed under a negative.  Next, those sections (containing the latent image) are warmed and applied to the surface of a gather of hot glass on the blowpipe.  As the object is completed over several furnace reheats, the heat develops the image as the object is being created.  This method specifically eliminates the need for the reheating of the object in a kiln for development, which consumes considerable oven time, energy, and the risk of loss or damage due to shattering on the way up to temperature, or more importantly, slumping while being held at temperature.  The timing of the glassblower determines the final degree of development, and simple choices of form minimize distortion in the image.

Since the image is inside and actually a part of the glass itself, photosensitive glass is the most durable photographic medium known.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt; It is claimed that a photo image within photosensitive glass is the most durable form of photography and will last as long as the glass itself.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="june1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt; The photographic image is '''not''' on the surface of the glass, but internally.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;

Fluorescent photosensitive glass makes it possible to make fluorescent photographs and fluorescence holography.&lt;ref name ="fluorescent1"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WM2-45S99G6-48&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=61111fe4a495093bf3b6946e0ef0ca18|title= Fluorescent Photosensitive Glass—A Novel Material for Optical Memory and Fluorescence Holography |accessdate= 2008-08-15|doi=10.1006/jssc.1997.7580|volume=134|issue= 2 |journal=Journal of Solid State Chemistry|pages=362–363|year= 1997 |last1= Pavel |first1= E |last2= Tugulea |first2= L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photosensitive glass is different from [[Photochromism|photochromatic glass]].&lt;ref name ="glassfacts1"/&gt;  Photochromatic glass is used in self-darkening sunglasses which darkens when exposed to bright daylight.&lt;ref name ="glassfacts1"/&gt; It then returns to see-through transparency when strong daylight is removed and can then be used indoors as regular glasses.&lt;ref name ="glassfacts1"/&gt;

Little has been done to develop the product since its patent.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt; It is labor-intensive and has a high cost.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt; Only large commercial glass factories produce it.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt; In the 1980s photosensitive glass was created to a small degree to be used in "hot glass" work.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt; Then individual artists owned smaller studios and created works in blown glass and began experimenting with photosensitive glass.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt; Going into the Twenty-First Century only a few glass artists know the technique of achieving good results with photosensitive glass.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;
In the present time, the only photosensitive glasses produced are PhotoCor(R), [[Foturan]] and APEX. [http://flatpaneldisplay.blogspot.com/2018/09/cornings-secret-menu.html PhotoCor] is produced by the inventor, Corning, Inc. [[Foturan]] is produced by [[Schott AG|SCHOTT Corporation]] and APEX by Life Bioscience.&lt;ref name ="glass fab2"/&gt; Photosensitive glass has been used as a holographic material to record diffractive optical elements for high power laser applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glebov |first=Leonid B. |title=Photosensitive holographic glass - new approach to creation of high power lasers |journal=Physics and Chemistry of Glasses: European Journal of Glass Science and Technology Part B |volume=48 |date=June 2007 |pages=123–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military applications===
One of the reasons for the delay between the invention of photosensitive glass and its public announcement approximately ten years later was its potential use in military applications.&lt;ref name =" photosensitive1"/&gt; It is possible to burn images and words that are hidden in photosensitive glass until heated at a high temperature.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;  The military used this fact during World War II to send secret messages to allied troops in pieces of what looked like "ordinary glass".&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;  At the other hand, the person who received the "ordinary glass" just had to heat it up to read the hidden message.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt; Because of this application photosensitive glass was kept secret until the end of World War II.&lt;ref name ="stookey1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "McGraw-Hill"/&gt;

===Building applications===
The [[United Nations Building]] is faced with hundreds of square feet of photosensitive glass.&lt;ref name ="henrys1"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=EPIuXHxLJRgC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=photosensitive+glass|title=Henry's Attic By Ford Richardson Bryan et al., p. 344 |accessdate= 2008-08-19|isbn=978-0814326428 |last1=Bryan |first1=Ford Richardson |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proto.io''' is an [[mobile application|application]] prototyping platform launched in 2011 and developed by the Labs Division of SNQ Digital.&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/proto-io |title=Proto.io |author= |date=27 July 2012 |publisher=CrunchBase |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UX"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uxmag.com/resources/protoio-mobile-prototyping |title=Proto.io - Mobile Prototyping |author=Artemis Pattichi |date= |publisher=UX Magazine |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2012/06/07/mockup-tools/ |title=9 Excellent Tools for Design Mockups |author=Kelli Shaver |date=7 June 2012 |publisher=Mashable |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed to prototype on mobile devices, Proto.io has expanded to allow users to prototype apps for anything with a screen interface, including [[smart TV|Smart TV’s]], [[digital camera]] interfaces, [[cars]], [[airplanes]], and [[gaming consoles]]. Proto.io utilizes a drag and drop user interface (UI) and does not require [[computer programming|coding]].&lt;ref name="CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UX" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netmagazine.com/features/20-best-new-tools-web-design-and-development-2012 |title=Mark Penfold Compiles a Top 20 From His Monthly Roundup of the Best New Tools That Saw the Light of Day This Year - and Many are Free! |author=Mark Penfold |date=12 December 2012 |publisher= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Since its launch in 2011, there have been three versions of Proto.io released.

===Version 1===
In 2011, SNQ made the 100% web-based Proto.io tool available online.&lt;ref name="CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UX" /&gt; The web-based environment allowed users to create a project for either the [[iPad]] or [[iPhone]]. After a user created a few screens for a developing app, Proto.io could then link those pages together with interactive actions that are custom to hand held devices, such as clicks, taps, tap and holds, and swipes.&lt;ref name="WF1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wireframes.linowski.ca/2011/10/proto-io-mobile-app-prototyping/ |title=Proto.io - Mobile App Prototyping |author=Alexis Piperides |date=13 October 2011 |publisher=Wireframes |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aericon.com/blog/mobile-blog/fast-mobile-prototyping-with-proto-io/ |title=Fast Mobile Prototyping with Proto.io |author=Dean Whitney |date=28 November 2012 |publisher=AerIcon |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitaljournal.com/blog/19829#tab=comments&amp;sc=0 |title=Why Proto.io is a Revolution in Prototyping |author=Hayder Rehman |date=31 December 2012 |publisher=Digital Journal |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the platform, users could also create reusable templates into which prepackaged and editable elements could be dragged. Once the user had completed the prototype, Proto.io could then publish and preview the finished product not only on the web browser but also on the actual mobile device.&lt;ref name="WF1" /&gt;

===Version 2===

Proto.io V2 was released in early 2012 and expanded the supported mobile devices to accommodate for the Android platform, to include the Android Smartphone and Tablet. The platform also came with a newer user interface. Proto.io V2 also added collaboration features like comments and annotations as well as export to [[HTML]] functionality.&lt;ref name="WF2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wireframes.linowski.ca/2012/03/proto-io-v2-silly-fast-mobile-prototyping/ |title=Proto.io V2 - Silly-fast Mobile Prototyping |author= |date=15 March 2012 |publisher=Wireframes |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 3===

On September 28, 2012, with the release of version 3 of the platform, Proto.io became the first prototyping tool to allow users to prototype on almost any device with a screen interface, and the first mobile prototyping tool to support full feature animations of user interface items within a prototype screen.&lt;ref name="WF3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wireframes.linowski.ca/2012/10/proto-io-v3-changes-mobile-prototyping-as-we-know-it/ |title=Proto.io V3 - Changes Mobile Prototyping As We Know It |author=Alexis Piperides |date=1 October 2012 |publisher=Wireframes |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The included icon gallery contains thousands of SVG icons for use as buttons, lists and tab bars.&lt;ref name="DJ" /&gt; Proto.io V3 also supports web fonts, which allows the user to access all available online fonts.&lt;ref name="WF3" /&gt;

A '''recuperative multi-tube cooler''' is a rotary drum cooler used for continuous processes in [[chemical engineering]].

== Construction ==
Recuperative multi-tube coolers essentially exist of a turning rotor which is mostly driven via chain. At the ends of the rotor are stiff cases for product feed and outlet. The rotor is supported on running treads, as it is typical for rotary drums.
The interior of the rotor exists of several tubes in a revolvertype (or planetary) arrangement. The tubes are completely surrounded by a jacket.

According to requirements recuperative multi-tube coolers are built with diameters between 1.0 and 4.0 m and lengths from 10 to 40 m.

== Function ==
Recuperative multi-tube coolers work with indirect air cooling. That means, that there is no direct contact between the product to be cooled and the cooling air. The heat is exchanged indirectly via thermal conduction.
Ambient air is used as cooling air, which is drawn between the jacket and the tubes. Product and cooling air pass through the cooler in counterflow.  
The product to be cooled falls directly into the product feed housing. By the rotary movement and a little slope of the rotor, the product is conveyed through the cooler. The rotation causes a permanent mixing of the product in the tubes and hence a good heat transfer.

Due to the indirect method of operation, the coolers provide hot and clean air that can be reused as energy. This opportunity of recovering energy is where the term recuperative results from.

== Applications ==
The coolers can be used for the cooling of free flowing, fine grained bulk material. They are especially used when consumers of the recovered hot air are close-by. Usual this is the case in [[calcination]] processes after hotgas fired [[rotary kiln]]s in or similar. 
The hot air is used as preheated supply of combustion air in the kilns. The consumption of primary energy can be reduced seriously.

The coolers are mostly used in the pigment industry, e.g. for cooling of titandioxide pigments after calcination.
The entry temperatures of the products can reach up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.

The US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] has adopted the name ''unmanned aircraft'' (UA) to describe [[unmanned aerial vehicle|aircraft systems without a flight crew on board]].&lt;ref name="FAA summary" /&gt; More common names include ''UAV'', ''drone'', ''remotely piloted vehicle'' (''RPV''), ''remotely piloted aircraft'' (''RPA''), and ''remotely operated aircraft'' (''ROA''). These "limited-size" (as defined by the ''[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]'') unmanned aircraft flown in the USA's [[National Airspace System]], flown solely for recreation and sport purposes, such as models, are generally{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} flown under the voluntary safety standards of the [[Academy of Model Aeronautics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.modelaircraft.org/files/105.pdf |title=Model "Academy of Model Aeronautics National Model Aircraft Safety Code" |date=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States' national aeromodeling organization.  To operate a UA for non-recreational purposes in the United States, according to the FAA users must obtain a ''Certificate of Authorization'' (COA) to operate in national airspace.&lt;ref name="FAA: Certificate of Authorization or Waiver (COA)"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAA: Certificate of Authorization or Waiver (COA)|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/aaim/organizations/uas/coa/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015 the FAA announced that all UAVs weighing more than 250 grams flown for any purpose must be registered with the FAA.&lt;ref name ="Drone Registration"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.inc.com/joseph-steinberg/drones-in-america-must-now-be-registered-here-is-what-you-need-to-know.html |work=Inc. | title=Drones in America Must Now Be Registered.

== Regulation ==
The [[FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt381/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt381.pdf|format=PDF|title=FAA MODERNIZATION AND REFORM ACT OF 2012 |publisher=Gpo.gov|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets a deadline of September 30, 2015, for the agency to establish regulations to allow the use of commercial drones.  In the meantime, the agency claims it is illegal to operate commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, but approves non-commercial flights under 400 feet if they follow [[AC 91-57|Advisory Circular 91-57]], Model Aircraft Operating Standards, published in 1981.&lt;ref name="FAA summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/reg/media/frnotice_uas.pdf |accessdate=March 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610135230/http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/reg/media/frnotice_uas.pdf |archivedate=June 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the FAA's attempt to fine a commercial drone operator for a 2011 flight were thrown out on March 6, 2014 by NTSB judge Patrick Geraghty, who found that the FAA had not followed the proper rulemaking procedures and therefore had no UAV regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/faa-small-drones-ban-104393.html |title=Judge strikes down small drones ban |last1=Robillard |first1=Kevin |date=March 6, 2014 |website=www.politico.com |publisher=Politico LLC |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAA will appeal the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/07/us-usa-aircraft-drones-idUSBREA261PY20140307 |title=U.S. FAA will appeal ruling on commercial drone use |last1=Krasny |first1=Ros |last2=Maler |first2=Sandra |date=March 7, 2014 |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=Thomson Reuters |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas EquuSearch, which performs volunteer [[search and rescue]] operations, was also challenging FAA rules in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amablog.modelaircraft.org/amagov/2014/04/21/texas-equusearch-requests-faa-to-reverse-its-ban-on-uas-search-rescue-operations/|title=Texas EquuSearch petitions the court to reverse FAA's ban on volunteer UAS Search &amp; Rescue operations - AMA Government Relations Blog|publisher=Amablog.modelaircraft.org|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the FAA announced six operators it was authorizing to conduct research on drone technology, to inform its pending regulations and future developments.  These were the [[University of Alaska]] (including locations in Hawaii and Oregon), the state of [[Nevada]], [[Griffiss International Airport]] in New York State, the [[North Dakota Department of Commerce]], [[Texas A&amp;M University–Corpus Christi]], and [[Virginia Tech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=75399|title=FAA Selects Six Sites for Unmanned Aircraft Research|publisher=Taa.gov|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to FAA certification, the regulation of usage of UA systems by government authorities in the United States for law enforcement purposes is determined at a state level. As of September 2014, 20 U.S. states had enacted legislation addressing the use of UA systems and the handling of data collected by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/current-uas-state-law-landscape.aspx|title=Current Unmanned Aircraft State Law Landscape|publisher=Ncsl.org|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all enacted laws require a probable cause warrant to be issued before the use of a UA system for surveillance purposes is authorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty/status-2014-domestic-drone-legislation-states|title=Status of 2014 Domestic Drone Legislation in the States|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, a group of major news media companies filed an ''[[Amicus curiae|amicus]]'' brief in a case before the U.S.'s [[National Transportation Safety Board]], asserting that the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]'s "overly broad" administrative limitations against private UAS operations cause an "impermissible chilling effect on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] newsgathering rights of journalists", the brief being filed three months before a scheduled rollout of FAA commercial operator regulations.&lt;ref name=WashPost20140507&gt;{{cite news|last=Fung|first=Brian|title=Major news outlets call the FAA’s drone restrictions a violation of the First Amendment|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/05/07/major-news-outlets-call-the-faas-drone-restrictions-a-violation-of-the-first-amendment/?wprss=rss_technology|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 7, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PQ8zvSdm?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/05/07/major-news-outlets-call-the-faas-drone-restrictions-a-violation-of-the-first-amendment/?wprss=rss_technology|archivedate=May 8, 2014|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}} ''FAA v.

On January 12, 2015, [[CNN]] announced that their News Network has been cleared by the FAA, in the first program of its kind to test camera-equipped drones for news gathering and reporting purposes. CNN has partnered with the Georgia Tech Research Institute to collect data for the program. The FAA said it will analyze the information to develop rules about using drones for news gathering.&lt;ref name="CNN Cleared By FAA To Test Drones For News Reporting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/12/technology/cnn-drone/|title=CNN cleared to test drones for reporting|accessdate=January 12, 2015|work=CNN Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2015, The FAA announced that up to seven thousand businesses could get approval to fly drones two years from now under proposed rules by the FAA. On Sunday the White House also issued a presidential directive that mandates federal agencies for the first time to disclose publicly where they are flying drones and what they do with the data they acquire using aerial surveillance.

In December 2015 the FAA announced that all UAVs weighing more than 250 grams flown for any purpose must be registered with the FAA.&lt;ref name="Drone Registration"/&gt;  The FAA's Interim Rule can be [https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/20151213_IFR.pdf accessed here].  This regulation went into effect on December 21, 2015 and requires that hobby type UAV's between 250 grams and 55 pounds need to be registered no later than February 19, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Thomas E.|title=That Drone in Your Holiday Stocking Must Now Be Registered With FAA|date=17 December 2015|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/drone-your-holiday-stocking-must-now-be-registered-faa|accessdate=17 December 2015|publisher=Neal, Gerber &amp; Eisenberg LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAA's registration portal for drones can be [https://www.faa.gov/uas/registration/ accessed here].

Notable requirements of the FAA UAV registration process include:
* Effective December 21, 2015, if the UAV has never been operated in U.S. airspace (i.e. its first flight outside), eligible owners must register their UAV's prior to flight.  If the UAV previously operated in U.S. airspace, it must be registered by February 19, 2016.
* In order to use the registration portal, you must be 13 years of age or older. If the owner is less than 13 years old, then a parent or other responsible person must do the FAA registration.
* Each registrant will receive a certificate of aircraft registration and a registration number and all UAV's must be marked with the FAA issued registration number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ritt|first1=Steven L.|title=Drones: Recreational/Hobby Owners Web-based Registration Process|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/drones-recreationalhobby-owners-web-based-registration-process|accessdate=17 December 2015|work=The National Law Review|publisher=Michael Best &amp; Friedrich LLP|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The FAA registration requires a $5 fee, though the FAA is waiving the fee for the first 30 days of the new registration period - until January 20, 2016. The registration is good for 3 years, but can be renewed for an additional 3 years at the $5 rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Brian D|last2=Schenendorf|first2=Jack L|last3=Kiehl|first3=Stephen|title=Looking Forward After the FAA’s Drone Registration Regulation|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/looking-forward-after-faa-s-drone-registration-regulation|accessdate=17 December 2015|publisher=Covington &amp; Burling LLP|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new FAA rule provides that a single registration applies to as many UAVs as an owner/operator owns or operates. Failure to register can result in civil penalties of up to $27,500 and criminal penalties which could include fines up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment for up to three years.&lt;ref name="That Drone"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Thomas E.|title=That Drone in Your Holiday Stocking Must Now Be Registered With FAA|journal=The National Law Review|date=17 December 2015|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/drone-your-holiday-stocking-must-now-be-registered-faa|accessdate=17 December 2015|publisher=Neal, Gerber &amp; Eisenberg LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To show problems with the FAA process, in August, 2015 an attorney was able to get FAA approval for a commercial drone that was actually a battery powered paper airplane toy.  Its controllable range is 120 feet (37 meters) and maximum flight time is 10 minutes. It is too underpowered to carry a camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2015/September/02/Lawyer-gets-FAA-to-approve-paper-airplane Lawyer gets FAA to approve paper airplane]&lt;/ref&gt;

reversed the Dec. 2015 UAV registration rule, commenting that "the FAA may not
promulgate any rule or regulation regarding a model aircraft."  Specifically, the FAA’s Registration Rule for model aircraft (a/k/a drones) violates Section 336 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act, and the FAA's Registration Rule to the extent it applied to model aircraft was vacated.  The FAA began the process of refunding the registration fees.

On December 12, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law the immediately-effective National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, reinstating the FAA’s drone registration requirement.

==State-level regulation==
Under 49 U.S. Code § 40103, "The United States Government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States" and U.S. citizens have "a public right of transit through the navigable airspace."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40103 49 U.S. Code § 40103]&lt;/ref&gt; The FAA is invested with the authority to control traffic in navigable airspace and create operational and safety regulations on aircraft in navigable airspace. According to the FAA, "[a] navigable airspace free from inconsistent state and local restrictions is essential to the maintenance of a safe and sound air transportation system."&lt;ref name="FAA: State-Local law fact sheet"/&gt;{{Rp|2}} With respect to navigable airspace and the aircraft operating in that airspace, federal regulations have [[field preemption|preempted the field]] and the ability of state and local laws to regulate use of UAVs is limited.&lt;ref name="FAA: State-Local law fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=State and Local Regulation of  Unmanned  Aircraft System s (UAS) Fact Sheet|url=https://www.faa.gov/uas/regulations_policies/media/UAS_Fact_Sheet_Final.pdf|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel|accessdate=4 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203171552/http://www.faa.gov/uas/regulations_policies/media/UAS_Fact_Sheet_Final.pdf|archivedate=February 3, 2016|format=PDF|date=December 17, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|2–3}}

Examples of state and local laws that, according to the FAA, conflict with the FAA's federal legal authority and require consultation with the FAA before being enacted:&lt;ref name="FAA: State-Local law fact sheet"/&gt;{{Rp|3}}
*Operational UAS restrictions on flight altitude, flight paths; operational bans; any regulation of the navigable airspace. For example–a city ordinance banning anyone from operating UAS within the city limits, within the air space of the city, or within certain distances of landmarks.
*Mandating equipment or training for UAS related to aviation safety such as geo-fencing would likely be preempted. Courts have found that state regulation pertaining to mandatory training and equipment requirements related to aviation safety is not consistent with the federal regulatory framework. ''Med-Trans Corp. v. Benton'', 581 F. Supp. 2d 721, 740 (E.D.N.C. 2008); ''Air Evac EMS, Inc. v. Robinson'', 486 F. Supp. 2d 713, 722 (M.D. Tenn. 2007).

Examples of state and local laws that, according to the FAA, are generally permissible under the state's police powers:&lt;ref name="FAA: State-Local law fact sheet"/&gt;{{Rp|3}}
*Requirement for police to obtain a warrant prior to using a UAS for surveillance.
*Specifying that UAS may not be used for voyeurism.
*Prohibitions on using UAS for hunting or fishing, or to interfere with or harass an individual who is hunting or fishing.
*Prohibitions on attaching firearms or similar weapons to UAS.

In 2014, the California State Senate passed rules imposing strict regulations on how law enforcement and other government agencies can use drones. The legislation would require law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant before using an unmanned aircraft, or drone, except in emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Segar|first1=Mike|title=California Senate approves measure banning warrantless drone surveillance|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/28/us-usa-religion-minnesota-idUSKBN0GS03R20140828|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Virginia passed legislation that a drone may only be used in law enforcement if a warrant has been issued; excluding emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virginia HB 2125|url=https://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?151+cab+HC10226HB2125+HBSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey's drone legislation passed in 2015 states that not only are you required to provide a warrant for drone use in law enforcement, but the information collected must be disposed within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey A1039|url=https://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?151+ful+HB2125+pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states that have drone regulation are Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drone Privacy Bill|url=https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-nj-cheers-passage-drone-privacy-bill-assembly-urges-senate-follow-suit-yes-vote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first landmark court case on state and municipal drone regulation was ''Singer v. City of Newton'', No. 17-10071-WGY (D. Mass. Sept. 21, 2017).

In 2015, a drone operated by a civilian flew into the White House property. As a result, the drone manufacturer, DJI, issued a statement saying that they will now require that all of their drones would contain built-in geofencing limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civilian Drone Use|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/building-regulation-drones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10537">'''Resistor–transistor logic''' ('''RTL''') (sometimes also '''transistor–resistor logic''' ('''TRL''')) is a class of [[digital circuit]]s built using [[resistor]]s as the input network and [[bipolar junction transistor]]s (BJTs) as switching devices. RTL is the earliest class of transistorized digital logic circuit used; other classes include [[diode–transistor logic]] (DTL) and [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL). RTL circuits were first constructed with [[discrete component]]s, but in 1961 it became the first digital [[logic family]] to be produced as a [[monolithic integrated circuit]]. RTL integrated circuits were used in the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]], whose design was begun in 1961 and which first flew in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch2-5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

=== RTL inverter ===

A bipolar [[Transistor#Transistor as a switch|transistor switch]] is the simplest RTL gate ([[Inverter (logic gate)|inverter]] or NOT gate) implementing [[logical negation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.play-hookey.com/digital_electronics/rtl_gates.html Resistor-Transistor Logic] explains the basic RTL gates and gives some useful calculations&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a [[Common emitter|common-emitter stage]] with a base resistor connected between the base and the input voltage source. The role of the base resistor is to expand the very small transistor input voltage range (about 0.7 V) to the logical "1" level (about 3.5 V) by converting the input voltage into current. Its resistance is settled by a compromise: it is chosen low enough to saturate the transistor and high enough to obtain high input resistance. The role of the collector resistor is to convert the collector current into voltage; its resistance is chosen high enough to saturate the transistor and low enough to obtain low output resistance (high [[fan-out]]).

=== One-transistor RTL NOR gate ===

With two or more base resistors (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) instead of one, the inverter becomes a two-input RTL [[NOR gate]] (see the figure on the right). The logical operation [[Logical disjunction|OR]] is performed by applying consecutively the two arithmetic operations [[addition]] and [[Comparison (mathematics)|comparison]] (the input resistor network acts as a parallel ''voltage summer'' with equally weighted inputs and the following common-emitter transistor stage as a ''voltage comparator'' with a threshold about 0.7 V). The equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical "1" and the equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical "0" form the two legs of a composed voltage divider driving the transistor. The base resistances and the number of the inputs are chosen (limited) so that only one logical "1" is sufficient to create base-emitter voltage exceeding the threshold and, as a result, saturating the transistor. If all the input voltages are low (logical "0"), the transistor is cut-off. The [[pull-down resistor]] R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; biases the transistor to the appropriate on-off threshold.  The output is inverted since the collector-emitter voltage of transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is taken as output, and is high when the inputs are low. Thus, the analog resistive network and the analog transistor stage perform the logic function NOR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=IBM |id=Form 223-6889 |first=IBM |year=1960 |title=Transistor Component Circuits |publisher=IBM |url=http://ibm-1401.info/Form223-6889-TransistorComponentCircuits.pdf |series=Customer Engineering Manual of Instruction |accessdate=2010-01-04 |quote=The logical function is performed by the input resistor network and the invert function is accomplished by the common emitter transistor configuration... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-transistor RTL NOR gate ===

The limitations of the one-transistor RTL NOR gate are overcome by the multi-transistor RTL implementation. It consists of a set of parallel-connected transistor switches driven by the logic inputs (see the figure on the right). In this configuration, the inputs are completely separated and the number of inputs is limited only by the small leakage current of the cut-off transistors at output logical "1". The same idea was used later for building [[Direct-coupled transistor logic|DCTL]], [[Emitter-coupled logic|ECL]], some [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] (7450, 7460), [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] and [[CMOS]] gates.

== Advantages ==

The primary advantage of RTL technology was that it used a minimum number of transistors. In circuits using discrete components, before integrated circuits, transistors were the most expensive component to produce. Early IC logic production (such as Fairchild's in 1961) used the same approach briefly, but quickly transitioned to higher-performance circuits such as [[diode–transistor logic]] and then [[transistor–transistor logic]] (starting 1963 at Sylvania), since diodes and transistors were no more expensive than resistors in the IC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Electronics: The Life Story of a Technology | author = David L. Morton Jr. and Joseph Gabriel | publisher = JHU Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-8018-8773-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rABggQmp31MC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=rtl+dtl+ttl+integrated+circuits }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

The disadvantage of RTL is its high power dissipation when the transistor is switched on, by current flowing in the collector and base resistors. This requires that more current be supplied to and heat be removed from RTL circuits. In contrast, TTL circuits with "[[Totem pole output|totem-pole]]" output stage minimize both of these requirements.

Another limitation of RTL is its limited [[fan-in]]: 3 inputs being the limit for many circuit designs, before it completely loses usable noise immunity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It has a low [[noise margin]]. Lancaster says that integrated circuit RTL NOR gates (which have one transistor per input) may be constructed with "any reasonable number" of logic inputs, and gives an example of an 8-input NOR gate.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard integrated circuit RTL NOR [[Logic gate|gate]] can drive up to 3 other similar gates.
Alternatively, it has enough output to drive up to 2 standard integrated circuit RTL "buffers", each of which can drive up to 25 other standard RTL NOR gates.&lt;ref name=Lancaster/&gt;

== Speeding up RTL ==

Various companies applied the following speed-up methods to discrete RTL.

Transistor switching speed has increased steadily from the first transistorized computers through the present.  The ''GE Transistor Manual'' (7th ed., p.&amp;nbsp;181, or 3rd ed., p.&amp;nbsp;97 or intermediate editions) recommends gaining speed by using higher-frequency transistors, or capacitors, or a diode from base to collector ([[Baker clamp|parallel negative feedback]]) to prevent saturation.&lt;ref name=Cleary&gt;
{{cite book

  | title = ''GE Transistor Manual''
  | edition = third through seventh editions
  | publisher = General Electric, Semiconductor Products Department, Syracuse, NY
  | year = 1958–1964 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Placing a capacitor in parallel with each input resistor decreases the time needed for a driving stage to forward-bias a driven stage's base-emitter junction.  Engineers and technicians use "RCTL" (resistor capacitor transistor logic) to designate gates equipped with "speed-up capacitors".  The Lincoln Laboratory [[TX-0|TX-0 computer's]] circuits included some RCTL.&lt;ref name=Fadiman&gt;
{{cite book | last=Fadiman | first=J. R. | year=1956 | title=TX0 Computer Circuitry  | publisher = MIT Lincoln Laboratory | url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/1401_CE_Drws_1962.pdf | accessdate=2011-09-09 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, methods involving capacitors were unsuitable for integrated circuits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Using a high collector supply voltage and diode clamping decreased collector-base and wiring capacitance charging time.  This arrangement required diode clamping the collector to the design logic level.  This method was also applied to discrete DTL ([[diode–transistor logic]]).&lt;ref name=DEC&gt;
{{cite book | last=DEC | first=Flip_Chip | year=1967 | title=The Digital Logic Handbook  | publisher = Digital Equipment Corporation| url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/handbooks/ | accessdate=2008-03-08 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method that was familiar in [[discrete-device]] logic circuits used a diode and a resistor, a germanium and a silicon diode, or three diodes in a negative feedback arrangement. These diode networks known as various [[Baker clamp]]s reduced the voltage applied to the base as the collector approached saturation. Because the transistor went less deeply into saturation, the transistor accumulated fewer stored charge carriers. Therefore, less time was required to clear stored charge during transistor turn off.&lt;ref name=Cleary/&gt; A low-voltage diode arranged to prevent saturation of the transistor was applied to integrated logic families by using [[Schottky diode]]s, as in Schottky [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1495">The '''SATURN Development Group''' was an important [[industry forum]] that enabled the specification of [[chip-to-chip interface]]s for the communications industry.  It was co-founded in 1992 by [[PMC-Sierra]] and [[Sun Microsystems]].  Several significant specifications were completed through its actions including PL-2, [[PL-3]], and [[PL-4]].  Many important semiconductor devices were developed to these specifications.  SATURN was also influential in the specification of the [[ATM Forum]]'s physical layer "UTOPIA" standards.

Initial members included [[SynOptics]] and [[Interphase]].  The first meeting was held in April 1992. By August 1993, the SATURN group had 28 members.

After the formation of the [[Optical Internetworking Forum]] (OIF), two of the SATURN group's interfaces were successfully adopted by OIF.  The [[PL-3]] specification became [[SPI-3]] and the [[PL-4]] specification became [[SPI-4.2]].  The existence of the OIF also eliminated the need for the SATURN Development Group, and it was wound down around 2002.

{{Unreferenced|date=March 2014}}
A '''saw filer''' or '''saw doctor''' is a person who maintains and repairs saws in a [[saw mill]]. A saw filer's work area in the mill is called the '''filing room'''.

Saws used in timber mills are very large and expensive. They need careful [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance]] for safe operation. Repair of damaged saws requires a high degree of skill. It takes many years of full-time saw filing to become proficient in the trade.

== Bandsaw filing ==
[[Bandsaw]]s in timber mills range in size from about (4" x 22ga x 10') to (16" x 11ga x 62') and can use any of the three main different saw band types: 
*Single-cut saws have, as the name implies, teeth on one side, allowing for cutting in one direction only.
*Double-cut saws have teeth on both sides. These types are designed for machinery that allows the log or work piece to be cut from either the front or the back direction of travel. 
*"Sliver tooth" saws have teeth on both sides but they have different profiles. The (usual) front side have teeth with a regular style tooth. The back of these saws have a longer style. The log is cut in a forward direction as with a single-cut but as the log returns, the saw de-burrs the ''cut'' (path where the saw passes) allowing for a cleaner finish. They are run for 4 to 24 hours then sent to the saw filer for maintenance.

The saw filer inspects the saw for needed repairs then gums, fits and benches the saw as necessary. 

'''Gumming''' involves grinding the gullets of the saw teeth to a particular shape. The saw filer uses a semi or fully automatic [[grinding machine]] for this. Saw bands operate under high stress and heat and in the presence of wood chips. Carbon migrates into the steel from the wood. Gumming prevents [[case hardening]] and fatigue cracking of the saw band gullets. Resaw Bandsaws (teeth on one side only) may be left or right-handed, depending on which way the teeth are pointing and which way the plank falls from the log when cutting. Double cut saws (teeth on both sides) are always gummed right hand teeth first.

A precise profile of the tooth (including gullet area, hook angle and top clearance angle) must be maintained for proper saw operation and wood chip removal. Ease of cutting greatly depends on this. The shape is determined by the type of wood and cutting conditions. A saw filer will maintain the gullet shape by manually shaping the grinding wheel with a dressing stone, and the set up of his grinding machine. Variations include face angle, face length, back angle, gullet width and depth, and a frost notch (if necessary). Typical bandsaw tooth dimensions are 1-3/4" tooth space x 3/4" gullet depth x 3/4" gullet width (grinding wheel width) x 30deg face angle x 16deg back angle.

'''Fitting''' means tooth dressing and involves swaging, shaping, gauging, and grinding. The tip of the saw tooth is [[swaging|swaged]] to a flare, then the sides are compressed in slightly with a shaper tool to an exact [[wikt:kerf|kerf]].  Then a final grinding pass is made.  The usual gauged tolerance is +/- .005" in kerf, and &lt; .003" side to side variation. The same grinding machinery used for gumming is used for fitting.

The saw kerf is usually made this way from the base saw metal. Sometimes, however, the kerf is made with [[stellite]] or [[Tungsten carbide|carbide]] tips, in which case swaging and shaping isn't needed, although gumming is still required.  The kerf may also be 'set' with a punch and hammer, with the teeth bent left, right, left... Set teeth are rarely used.

'''Benching''' is the leveling and tensioning of the saw.  When a saw band is run on a mill it is stretched with thousands of pounds of force, and during operation the cutting edge heats up.  These forces and temperatures cause the saw to deform. Benching deforms an un-mounted saw in a way that counteracts the operating stresses, and allows the saw to pull flat and cut straight when in use.  It takes months to learn benching.

Benching is done in a dark room with a stretcher-roller machine and flat anvil. A single light at the benchman’s work station, along with ground gauges, allows the saw filer to measure level and tension. 

Leveling is done with a crossface hammer and stretcher-roller adjustments. Cross face hammers are available in left and right hand versions.  Each filer has his own hammer which he carefully dresses.

Tensioning is done with the stretcher-roll. This machine has hardened rollers above and below the saw. They rotate slowly (one is powered, while one runs free) and pinch the saw when a lever is cranked, rolling a thin strip through the length of the saw, stretching the metal where it was rolled. Careful placement and force of the rolls deform the metal in a way that counteracts the forces the saw sees during operation. More rolls are placed in the midsection of the saw. Resaws have the back pulled to counteract the uneven heating of the cutting edge. This is done by rolling the back (non cutting edge) of the saw. The back is measured with a three pin gauge, and is usually around .003" per three feet curved. 

Benching involves the simultaneous solution of multiple deformations introduced to the saw to counteract the predicted stresses of the saw in operation. Benchman can easily recognize variations in steel batches.

Other bandsaw duties include [[welding]] broken teeth, fixing cracks, and [[trouble shooting]] operating problems.

[[CNC]] equipment has evolved to the point of being able to do significant benching and fitting tasks.

Most of the above terms are North American and are called different things in Australia, New Zealand as well as else where in the world. 
A Sawdoctor does both the tasks of the Benchman and Filler at the same time, with no distinction between the tasks as well as having to do both circular saws and bandsaws.
This like filing rooms are called Saw Shops in Australia. Most Saw Mills in Australia and New Zealand run a stellite tipped bandsaw in which the majority of what is stated above becomes redundant as it is specifically for sharpening and making the swaged tipped saws.

==Circular saw benching==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Circular saw]] --&gt;
Saw filers have the same maintenance duties with circular saws as they do with band saws, with a few exceptions;
*leveling is done mostly with specialized hammers of which there are 3 main types Dog head(side on profile resembles a dogs snout), twist face (A double sided hammer in which the faces are in a 45 degree alignment) and cross face ( faces are at 90 degrees to one another) and anvils (there are 2 main type of anvils dead (for levelling the saw) and live(for both leveling and tensioning the saw), although stretcher-roller machines are also used for leveling and tensioning.  
*Circular saws can be solid tooth(straight saw steel which are bent to give clearance of the saw blade) or can have carbide, Stellite or insert  teeth that don't need swaging.
*Fatigue cracking of the tooth gullet is not as common as in band saws, as in the majority of cases it is a heavier plate gauge and is not bent around band wheels multiple thousands of times per run.

Restore [[Nature]] in a Natural way is the technical concept of ''Simulate Loam Substrate'', and this technology is applied to form the ideal [[soil structure]], select suitable plant species to ensure the proportion of [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s in the later plant communities, &lt;ref name="National Intellectual Property Administration"&gt;[http://epub.sipo.gov.cn/tdcdesc.action?strWhere=CN107251729A 2017103443306 A Simulate Loam Substrate spray-casting construction method for slope].''[[National Intellectual Property Administration]]''.Retrieved 17 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;so as to restore [[Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lvyan.cn/about/?192.html Simulate Loam Substrate：Mine geological environment recovery technology].''lvyan.cn''.(in Chinese and English).Retrieved 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="China Land and Resources News"&gt;[http://zgdzzhyfz.paperopen.com/oa/darticle.aspx?type=view&amp;id=180123 类壤土基质技術及其在礦山環境恢復治理中的若干應用].''China Land and Resources News''.(in Chinese and English).Retrieved 25 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-ZGDH201801022.htm Simulate Loam Substrate类壤土基质及相關應用].''[[China National Knowledge Infrastructure]]''.Retrieved 22 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Technical principle===
As the ecological environment green governance technology, the core of ''Simulate Loam Substrate'' is to combine the engineering, botany, soil science and other disciplines to simulate the loam matrix structure suitable for plant growth through [[biomimetic technology]], which is beneficial to plant seeds, root development, microbial activity and nutrient transformation.&lt;ref name="National Intellectual Property Administration"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.cqu.edu.cn/asset/detail.aspx?id=203282775542 类壤土基质：一種新型生態環境綠色治理技術].''[[Chongqing University]]''.Retrieved 9 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1993 by ex-[[Microsoft]] development manager David Snipp&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cepro.com/article/dealer_taps_stardraw_software_for_multiroom_audio/ Dealer Taps Stardraw Software for Multiroom Audio - CE Pro Magazine Article from CE Pro]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Stardraw''' is a company that makes audio/visual [[system integration]] and [[Computer-aided design|design]] software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Stardraw.com StarDraw website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

Stardraw has two different but related sets of software both for the [[Audio-visual]] (A/V) market

===[[Computer aided design]]===

Stardraw's design software is for creating documentation of audio/visual systems.  This includes A/V [[schematics]] (similar to a [[Computer network diagram]]), Rack Layouts, Presentation Drawings (Pictorial Schematics), Panel Layouts for custom metalwork, Plan View drawings, and associated reports such as Bills of Materials, Quotations and Cable Schedules.

The software includes preset equipment icons to make it quick to create an illustrations of a A/V system design.

Their software of this type includes

*Stardraw Audio 2007 (Discontinued)
*Stardraw A/V 2007 (Discontinued)
*Stardraw A/V Lite 2007 (Discontinued)
*Stardraw Lighting 2D 2007 (Discontinued)
*Stardraw Design 7 - Released June 2011

===[[Control Software]]===

'''Stardraw control''' is their [[Integrated development environment]] for creating [[Touchscreen remote control]] of a wide variety of equipment.

Typical uses include [[room automation]] in boardrooms, auditoriums, museums or home theaters, where users use fixed and wireless touch-screens to control devices such as video projectors and displays, PCs, DVD and VCR players and recorders, cameras, teleconferencing systems, audio/video switchers and processing equipment, motorized projection screens, drapes, lighting, HVAC systems, and a wide variety of other types of equipment. Other common uses include entertainment systems, industrial command and control centers, security systems, hotels and restaurants.

What separates their software from rivals [[AMX LLC|AMX]] and [[Crestron Electronics|Crestron]] is that it does not require any special hardware instead it runs on any machine running [[Microsoft Windows]], further more the drivers and scripts for it are written in the general programming language [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] rather than a proprietary language and designed in a graphical environment similar to that used by Microsoft's programming languages.

The software also present a [[Web service]] interface which enables non-windows devices to control the software for example [[Tablet computer]]s such as Apples [[iPad]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_wv5XSBoSI Video of demonstration of the webservice on an ipad]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Land Institute''' is a [[non-profit]] research, education, and policy organization dedicated to [[sustainable agriculture]] based in [[Salina, Kansas]], United States. Their goal is to develop an [[agricultural]] system based on [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[crops]] that "has the [[ecological stability]] of the prairie and a grain yield comparable to that from [[annual plant|annual]] crops".&lt;ref name="officialwebsitemissionandvision" /&gt; The organization has trademarked '''Kernza perennial grain''', an intermediate wheatgrass grain in development.

==History==

==Kernza®==
[[File:Harvesting Cycle 2 Thinopyrum intermedium.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Harvesting a ''[[Thinopyrum intermedium]]'' breeding nursery at The Land Institute]]

The Land Institute has developed an [[intermediate wheatgrass]] (''Thinopyrum intermedium'') grain through its breeding program under Dr. Lee DeHaan, trademarked as [https://landinstitute.org/our-work/perennial-crops/kernza/ Kernza®] perennial grain. A '''[[perennial grain]]''' is a [[Food grain|grain crop]] that lives and remains productive for two or more years. Rather than growing for only one season before harvest, like most grains and annual crops, perennial grains grow year after year. As the first perennial grain crop grown across the northern United States, Kernza is expected to dramatically change agriculture, making croplands multifunctional through the production of both food and [[ecosystem services]].

'''&lt;u&gt;Products&lt;/u&gt;'''

Kernza breeding has dramatically increased seed size and production, hastening the timeline of commercialization, and resulting in the release of the first widely-available Kernza product, [https://www.patagoniaprovisions.com/pages/long-root-ale Long Root Ale] from [https://www.patagoniaprovisions.com/ Patagonia Provisions], in 2016.

The initiative and investment on the part of Patagonia Provisions to bring Long Root Ale to market helped pave the way for [https://landinstitute.org/cascadian-farm-partners-kernza/ other partnerships] and potential Kernza® products becoming more widely available to consumers.

Currently, there are a number of restaurants serving products made with Kernza®, including [https://www.birchwoodcafe.com/ Birchwood Cafe] in Minneapolis, [http://www.theperennialsf.com/ The Perennial] in San Francisco, [[Café Gratitude|Cafe Gratitude]] in the Los Angeles metro, and [http://avalanchepizza.net/ Avalanche Pizza] in Athens, OH.

[http://hopworksbeer.com/ Hopworks Urban Brewery] in Portland, OR and Vancouver, WA brewed Long Root Ale for [https://www.patagoniaprovisions.com/ Patagonia Provisions] and has it on tap, in addition to the ale in four-pack cans being sold in [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]] in California. [https://bangbrewing.com/ Bang! Brewing] in St. Paul, MN has a Kernza® beer available, as does Blue Skye Brewery near us in Salina, KS.

Innovative [http://www.dumplingandstrand.com/ Dumpling &amp; Strand] produces Kernza® pasta that they retail through Twin Cities-area farmers’ markets. 

Additionally, [https://www.cascadianfarm.com/our-farm/farm-blog/cascadian-farm-invests-in-kernza-perennial-grain Cascadian Farm] plans to incorporate Kernza® into some of its foods, with expectations for products made with Kernza® available in retail markets by late 2019.  Cascadian Farm has agreed to purchase an initial amount of the perennial grain, which is driving farmers to plant on commercial-scale fields versus the test sized plots currently being grown.

'''&lt;u&gt;Ecological Benefits&lt;/u&gt;''' 

With perennial soil cover such as that provided by Kernza, farmers stand to greatly reduce soil erosion, potentially turning agriculture into a soil-forming ecosystem, much like the natural ecosystems it replaced. Initial research suggests that due to extensive perennial roots, Kernza and other perennial crops may nurture beneficial soil microbiomes. The frequent soil disturbance required in annual crop production is disruptive to these microbiomes.

Deeper and more abundant root systems drive healthy soil. Scientific evidence documenting the ecosystem benefits of Kernza is accumulating. Research from other perennial systems such as pastures and perennial biofuel crops provide robust evidence of the potential benefits of a perennial grain like Kernza.  

For example, Paustian and colleagues recently published a paper in Nature titled “Climate-Smart Soils” that compares different landscape management approaches for increasing soil carbon sequestration. It is clear from their analysis that perennial grains would be a game-changer, as they could sequester carbon and maintain more cropland in production better than any alternative.

'''&lt;u&gt;Perennial Grains Story Project&lt;/u&gt;'''

The Perennial Grains Story Project is a strategic communications collaborative whose goal is to sustain enthusiasm and support for perennial grain polyculture development, and Kernza use in particular, as part of a holistic vision for more truly sustainable food production.

(1994). ''Transgenerational Design: Products for an Aging Population''. New York: Van Nostrand. p. 25 {{ISBN|0-442-01065-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''transgenerational design'' was coined in 1986, by [[Syracuse University]] industrial design professor James J. Pirkl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/p/pirkl_jj.htm|title=James J.

==Overview==

The transgenerational design concept establishes a common ground for those who are committed to integrating age and ability within the consumer population. Its underlying principle is that people, including those who are aged or impaired, have an equal right to live in a unified society.&lt;ref name="Pulos, Athur J. (1994)"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pulos|first=Arthur J.|title=Forward to: Transgenerational Design: Products for an Aging Population, by James J. Pirkl|year=1994|publisher=Van Nostrand Nostrand|location=New York|isbn=0-442-01065-6|pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgenerational design practice recognizes that human [[aging]] is a continuous, dynamic process that starts at birth and ends with death, and that throughout the [[aging process]], people normally experience occurrences of illness, accidents and declines in physical and sensory abilities that impair one’s [[independence]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. But most injuries, impairments and disabilities typically occur more frequently as one grows older and experiences the effects of [[senescence]] (biological aging).&lt;ref name="Pirkl &amp; Babic (1988a)"&gt;{{cite book|last = Pirkl|first = James J.|title = Guidelines and Strategies for Designing Transgenerational Products: An Instructor's Manual|publisher = Copley|isbn = 9780874112290|page=110|last2 = Anna L. Babic|date = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four facts clarify the interrelationship of age with physical and sensory vulnerability:

#  ''young'' people become ''old''
#  ''young'' people can become ''disabled''
#  ''old'' people can become ''disabled''
#  ''disabled'' people become ''old''

Within each situation, consumers expect products and services to fulfill and enhance their lifestyle, both physically and symbolically. Transgenerational design focuses on serving their needs through what Cagan and Vogel call “a value oriented product development process”.&lt;ref name="Cagan &amp; Vogel, 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cagan|first=Jonathan|author2=Craig M. Vogel |title=Creating Breakthrough Products|year=2007|publisher=FT Press|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-969694-6|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; They note that a product is “deemed of value to a customer if it offers a strong effect on lifestyle, enabling features, and meaningful ergonomics” resulting in products that are “''useful'',  ''usable'', and ''desirable''” during both short and long term use by people of all ages and abilities.&lt;ref name="Cagan &amp; Vogel, 2002"/&gt;{{rp|p.34}}

Transgenerational design is “framed as a market-aware response to population aging that fulfills the need for products and environments that can be used by both young and old people living and working in the same environment”.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, John. (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarkson|first=John|author2=Roger Coleman |author3=Simeon Keates |author4= Cherie Lebbon |chapter=From margins to mainstream|title=Inclusive Design: Design for the Whole Population|year=2003|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=978-1-85233-700-1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.16}}

==Benefits==

Transgenerational design benefits all ages and abilities by creating a harmonious bond between products and the people that use them. It satisfies the [[psychological]], [[physiological]], and [[sociological]] factors desired—and anticipated—by users of all ages and abilities:&lt;ref name="Pirkl &amp; Babic 1988"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

*  [[Safety]]
*  [[Comfort]]
*  [[Convenience]]
*  [[Usability]]
*  [[Ergonomics]]
*  [[Communication accommodation theory|Accommodation]]

Transgenerational design addresses each element and accommodates the user—regardless of age or ability—by providing a sympathetic fit and unencumbered ease of use. Such designs provide greater accessibility by offering wider options and more choices, thereby preserving and extending one’s independence, and enhancing the [[quality of life]] for all ages and abilities—at no group’s expense.

Transgenerational designs [[Communication accommodation theory|accommodate]] rather than [[discriminate]] and [[sympathize]] rather than [[stigmatize]]. They do this by:&lt;ref name="Kohlbacher, F. and C. Herstatt, eds. 2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Heart Transplant for Housing|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-75330-8|pages=141–155|authorlink=The Silver Market Phenomenon|editor=F. Kohlbacher and C. Herstatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  bridging the transitions across life’s stages
*  responding to the widest range of individual differences
*  helping people remain active and independent
*  adapting to changing sensory and physical needs
*  maintaining one’s dignity and self-respect
*  enabling one to choose the appropriate means to accomplish activities of daily living

==History==

Transgenerational design emerged during the mid-1980s coincident with the conception of [[universal design]], an outgrowth of the [[disability rights movement]] and earlier '''barrier-free''' concepts. In contrast, transgenerational design grew out of the [[Age Discrimination Act of 1975]] (ADA), which prohibited “discrimination on the basis of age in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance”, or excluding, denying or providing different or lesser services on the basis of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/resources/laws/ageregulation.html | title= U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services| accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing political interest and debate over the Act’s 1978 amendments, which abolished mandatory retirement at age 65, made the issues of aging a major [[public policy]] concern by injecting it into the mainstream of societal awareness.&lt;ref name="Bellos, Neal S. (1987)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bellows |first=Neal S.|title=Profiling the Elderly Consumer|journal=Innovation: Journal of the Industrial Designers Society of America|issue=Summer|year=1987|volume=6|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

At the start of the 1980s, the oldest members of the population, having matured during the [[great depression]], were being replaced by a generation of [[Baby Boomers]], steadily reaching [[middle age]] and approaching the threshold of retirement. Their swelling numbers signaled profound [[demographic]] changes ahead that would steadily expand the [[aging population]] throughout the world.

Advancements in medical research were also changing the image of [[old age]]—from a [[social]] problem of the sick, poor, and senile, whose solutions depend on public policy—to the emerging reality of an active [[aging population]] having vigor, resources, and time to apply both.&lt;ref name="Bellos, Neal S. (1987)"/&gt;

Responding to the public’s growing awareness, the media, public policy, and some institutions began to recognize the impending implications. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' devoted cover stories to the "Greying of America". Local radio stations began replacing their [[rock-and-roll]] formats with music targeted to more mature tastes. The ''Collegiate Forum'' (Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc.) devoted its Fall 1982 issue entirely to articles on the aging work force. A ''National Research Conference on Technology and Aging'', and the ''Office of Technological Assessment of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]'', initiated a major examination of the impact of science and technology on older Americans”.&lt;ref name="Bellos, Neal S. (1987)"/&gt;

In 1985, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Administration on Aging]], the Farmer’s Home Administration, and the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] signed an agreement to improve building, landscape, product and graphic design for older Americans, which included new research applications for [[old age]] that recognized the potential for making products easier to use by the elderly, and therefore more appealing and profitable.&lt;ref name="Bellos, Neal S. (1987)"/&gt;

===Development===

In 1987, recognizing the implications of [[population aging]], [[Syracuse University]]’s ''Department of Design'', ''All-University Gerontology Center'', and ''Center for Instructional Development'' initiated and collaborated on an interdisciplinary project, ''Industrial Design Accommodations: A Transgenerational Perspective''.&lt;ref name="Grant No. 90AT0182"/&gt; The year-long project, supported by a Federal grant,&lt;ref name="Grant No. 90AT0182"/&gt; joined the knowledge base of [[gerontology]] with the professional practice of [[industrial design]].

The project defined “the three aspects of aging as [[physiological]], [[sociological]], and [[psychological]]; and divided the designer’s responsibility into [[aesthetic]], [[technological]], and [[humanistic]] concerns”.&lt;ref name="Pirkl, James J, (1987)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pirkl|first=James J.|title=Transgenerational Design: An Instructional Project to Prepare Industrial Design Professionals|journal=Innovation: Journal of the Industrial Designers Society of America|issue=Summer|year=1987|volume=6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The strong interrelationship between the [[physiological]] aspects of aging and industrial design’s [[humanistic]] aspects established the project’s instructional focus and categorized the physiological aspects of aging as the sensory and physical factors of  ''vision'', ''hearing'', ''touch'', and ''movement''. This interrelationship was translated into a series of reference tables, which related specific [[Human body|physical]] and [[sensory perception|sensory]] factors of aging, and were included in the resulting set of design guidelines to:

*  sensitize designers and design students to the aging process
*  provide them with appropriate knowledge about this process
*  accommodate the changing needs of our transgenerational population

The project produced and published two instructional manuals—one for instructors&lt;ref name="Pirkl &amp; Babic (1988a)"/&gt; and one for design professionals&lt;ref name="Pirkl &amp; Babic 1988"/&gt;—each containing a detailed set of "design guidelines and strategies for  designing transgenerationalproducts". Under terms of the grant, instructional manuals were distributed to all academic programs of industrial design recognized by the [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] (NASAD).

===Chronology===

*  '''1988:'''   The term ‘transgenerational design’ first appears to have been publicly recognized and acknowledged by the [[Bristol-Myers]] Company in its Annual Report, which stated, “The trend towards transgenerational design seems to be catching on in some fields”, noting that “transgenerational design has the added advantage of circumventing the stigmatizing label of being ‘old’ ”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Special Report: America Comes of Age|year=1988|publisher=Bristol-Myers Company|location=New York|page=25|authorlink=Changes in the Marketplace}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''1989:'''   The results of the 1987 Federal grant project were first presented at the national conference, ''Exploration: Technological Innovations for an Aging Population'', supported in part by the [[American Association of Retired Persons]] (AARP) and the [[National Institute on Aging]].&lt;ref name="Pirkl, James J. (1989)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pirkl|first=James J.|title=Transgenerational Design: Providing Products for People of All Ages| journal=Technological Innovations for an Aging Population|location=Lake Buena Vista, Fl|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Stout|year=1989|pages=115–118 |isbn=0-916671-72-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceedings focused “on current efforts to address the impact of technology and an aging population, identification of high impact issues and problems, innovative ideas, and potential solutions”.
*  Also in 1989 [[Design News]], the Japanese design magazine, introduced “the new concept of ''transgenerational design'' (for) coping with the needs of an aging population and its strategy”, stating that “the impact will soon be felt by all global institutions” and “alter the present course of industrial design practice and education”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pirkl|first=James J.|title=Transgenerational Design: a Global Challenge|magazine=Design News: Magazine of Industrial Design|year=1989|volume=203|pages=26–29|publisher=Japan Industrial Design Promotion Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''1990:'''   The [[OXO (brand)|OXO]] company introduced the first group of 15 [[Good Grips]] kitchen tools to the U.S. Market. “These ergonomically-designed, transgenerational tools set a new standard for the industry and raised the bar to consumer expectation for comfort and performance”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Grips|url=http://www.hermas.ca/oxo-good-grips/|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Farber, OXOs founder, stated that “population trends demand transgenerational products, products that will be useful to you throughout the course of your life” because “it extends the life of a product and its materials by anticipating the whole experience of the user”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=Lawrence, Peter | title=Entrepreneur Sam Farber on Design | url=http://www.atissuejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/interv/int_7_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''1991:'''   The Fall issue of the ''Design Management Journal'' addressed the issue of “Responsible Design” and introduced the transgenerational design concept in the article, “Transgenerational Design: A Strategy Whose Time Has Arrived”.  The article presented a description, the rationale, and examples of early transgenerational products, and offered “insights on the rationale and benefits of such a transgenerational approach”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pirkl|first=James J.|title=Transgenerational Design: A Design Strategy Whose Time Has Arrived|journal=Design Management Journal|year=1991|volume=Vo. 2|issue= 4|pages=55–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''1993:'''   The September–October issue of ‘’[[AARP]] The Magazine’’ exposed the transgenerational design concept to the readers in a featured article, “This Bold House”, describing the concept, details, and benefits of a transgenerational house. The article noted that “easy-grip handles, flat thresholds, and adjustable-height vanities are just the beginning in the world’s most accessible house,” providing families of all ages and abilities with “what they will want and need their whole lives”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Luscombe|first=Belinda|title=This Bold House|magazine=AARP the Magazine|date=September–October 1993|pages=46–52|publisher=AARP|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  In November, the transgenerational design concept was introduced in presentations to the European design community at the international symposiums, “Designing for Our Future Selves”, held at the ''[[Royal College of Art]]'' in London and the ''Netherlands Design Institute'' in Rotterdam.
*  '''1994:'''   The book, ''Transgenerational Design: Products for an Aging Population'' (Pirkl 1994), may be regarded as the prime mover of the widespread acceptance and practice of the transgenerational design concept. It presented the first specialized content and photographic examples of transgenerational products and environments, offering “practical strategies in response to [[population aging]], along with case study examples based on applying a better understanding of age-related capabilities”.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, John. (2003)"/&gt; It introduced the transgenerational design concept to the international design and [[gerontology]] communities, broadening the conventional idea of “environmental support” to include the product environment, sparking scholarly discussions and comparisons with other emerging concepts: ([[universal design]], design for all, [[inclusive design]], and [[gerontechnology]]).
*  '''1995:'''  The transgenerational design concept was presented at the first of the ‘’International Guest Lecture Series by World Experts’’, sponsored by the ''European Design for Aging Network'' (DAN) held consecutively at five international symposiums, “Designing for Our Future Selves”: ''Royal College of Art'', London, November 15;  ''Eindhoven University of Technology'', Eindhoven, November 16–19; ''The Netherlands Design Institute'', Amsterdam, November 21; ''University of Art and Design'', Helsinki, November 23–25; and ''National College of Art and Design'', Dublin, November 26–29.
*  '''2000:'''   “The Transgenerational House: A Case Study in Accessible Design and Construction” was presented in June at ‘’Designing for the 21st Century: An International Conference on Universal Design’’, held at the Rhode Island College of Art and Design, Providence, RI.
*  '''2007:'''   ''Architectural Graphic Standards'', published by the [[American Institute of Architects]] and commonly referred to as the “architects bible”, presented a “Transgenerational House” case study in its "[[Inclusive Design]]" section. Described as an “intricate exploration in how the execution of detailed thought can create a living environment that serves the young and old alike, across generations”, the study includes plans for the room layout, kitchen, laundry, master bath, adjustable-height vanity, and roll-in shower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Architectural Graphic Standards|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-471-70091-3|pages= 889–893|edition=11|authorlink=Case Study: Transgenerational House, Placitas, NM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''2012:'''   The proliferation of transgenerational design has diminished the tendency to associate age and disability with deficit, decline and incompetence by providing a market-aware response to population aging and the need for living and work environments used by young and old people living and working in the same environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=Roger|last2=Clarkson|first2=John|last3=Dong|first3=Hua|last4=Cassim|first4=Julia|editor1-last=Cooper|editor1-first=Rachel|title=Design for Inclusivity: A Practical Guide to Accessibility, Innovation and User|date=2012|publisher=Grower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=1409458113|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing to emerge as a growing strategy for developing products, services and environments that accommodate people of all ages and abilities, "transgenerational design has been adopted by major corporations, like [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Kodak]]” who are “looking at product development the same way as designing products for people with visual, hearing and physical impairments,” so that people of any age can use them.&lt;ref name="UB Today"&gt;{{cite web|last1=LoTempio|first1=Susan M.|title=Need help with that?|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/UBT/UBT-archives/volume27number1/features/helpingHands.php|website=UBtoday|publisher=University at Buffalo Alumni Association|archiveurl=http://www.buffalo.edu/UBT/UBT-archives/volume27number1/features/helpingHands.php|archivedate=2012|date=Fall 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions between designers and marketers are indicating that successful transgenerational design “requires the right balance of upfront research work, solid human factors analysis, extensive design exploration, testing and a lot of thought to get it right”, and that “transgenerational design is applicable to any consumer products company—from appliance manufacturers to electronics companies, furniture makers, kitchen and bath and mainstream consumer products companies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motiv in the news|url=http://www.proteusdesign.com/transgenerational_print.php|work=Transgenerational Design|publisher=Motiv|accessdate=3 August 2013|authors=Tom Feeheley, Matthew Bacon and Eric Nichols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TOD is also typically designed to be more [[Walkability|walkable]] than other [[built-up area]]s, through using smaller [[City block|block sizes]] and reducing the land area dedicated to [[Car|automobiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecitiesinstitute.org/topics/land-use-and-planning/transit-oriented-development-(tod)|title=Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)|website=www.sustainablecitiesinstitute.org|access-date=December 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220173407/http://www.sustainablecitiesinstitute.org/topics/land-use-and-planning/transit-oriented-development-(tod)|archive-date=December 20, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/transit-oriented-development-are-you-on-the-map/what-is-tod/|title=What is TOD?|last=|first=|date=|website=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The densest areas of a TOD are normally located within a radius of ¼ to ½ mile (400 to 800 m) around the central transit stop, as this is considered to be an appropriate scale for [[pedestrian]]s, thus solving the [[Last mile (transport)|last mile problem]].

==Description==
Many of the [[new town]]s created after [[World War II]] in [[Japan]], [[Sweden]], and [[France]] have many of the characteristics of TOD communities. In a sense, nearly all communities built on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] in the [[Netherlands]] or as [[exurban]] developments in [[Denmark]] have had the local equivalent of TOD principles integrated in their planning, including the promotion of [[bicycle|bicycles]] for local use.

In the United States, a half-mile-radius circle has become the de facto standard for rail-transit catchment areas for TODs. A half mile (800 m)  corresponds to the distance someone can walk in 10 minutes at {{Convert|3|mph|abbr=on}} and is a common estimate for the distance people will walk to get to a rail station. The half-mile ring is a little more than {{Convert|500|acres|km2|abbr=on}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uctc.net/access/42/access42_halfmiletods.shtml|title=Is a Half-Mile Circle the Right Standard for TODs?|last=Guerra|first=Erick|last2=Cervero|first2=Robert|authorlink2=Robert Cervero|work=ACCESS, [[University of California, Berkeley]]|date=Spring 2013|number=42|accessdate=June 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804141425/http://www.uctc.net/access/42/access42_halfmiletods.shtml|archive-date=August 4, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transit-oriented development is sometimes distinguished by some planning officials from "[[transit-proximate development]]" (see, e.g., comments made during a Congressional hearing &lt;ref&gt;[http://edf.org/documents/2698_Testimony03_03.pdf Clean Air and Transportation: Vital Concerns for TEA-21 Reauthorization] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040723081816/http://edf.org/documents/2698_Testimony03_03.pdf |date=July 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) because it contains specific features that are designed to encourage public transport use and differentiate the development from [[urban sprawl]]. A few examples  of these features include mixed-use development that will use transit at all times of day, excellent [[pedestrian facilities]] such as high quality [[pedestrian crossing]]s, narrow streets, and tapering of buildings as they become more distant from the public transport node. Another key feature of transit-oriented development that differentiates it from "transit-proximate development" is reduced amounts of [[parking]] for personal vehicles.

Opponents of compact, or transit oriented development typically argue that Americans, and persons throughout the world, prefer low-density living, and that any policies that encourage compact development will result in substantial [[utility]] decreases and hence large social welfare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Adrian.T.|last2=Staley|first2=Samuel.R.|last3=Poole|first3=Robert.W.|title=The role of VMT reduction in meeting climate change policy goals|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice |date=2010|volume=44|issue=8|pages=565–574|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2010.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of compact development argue that there are large, often unmeasured benefits of compact development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winkelman|first1=S.|last2=Bishins|first2=A.|title=Planning for economic and environmental resiliance|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|date=2010|volume=44|issue=8|pages=575–586|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2010.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the American preference for low-density living is a misinterpretation made possible in part by substantial local government interference in the land market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Jonathan|title=Markets and Choices in Transportation and Metropolitan Land Use|date=2006|publisher=Resources for the Future|location=Washington|isbn=978-1933115153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boarnet|first1=Marlon|title=A Broader Context for Land Use and Travel Behavior, and a Research Agenda|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|date=Summer 2011|volume=77|issue=3|pages=197–213|doi=10.1080/01944363.2011.593483|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2011.593483|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TOD in cities==
Many cities throughout the world are developing TOD policy. [[Toronto]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Montreal]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Vancouver]] among many other cities have developed, and continue to write policies and strategic plans, which aim to reduce [[automobile dependency]] and increase the use of public transit.

====Curitiba, Brazil====
One of the earliest and most successful examples of TOD is [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Curitiba was organized into transport corridors very early on in its history. Over the years, it has integrated its zoning laws and transportation planning to place high-density development adjacent to high-capacity transportation systems, particularly its [[Rede Integrada de Transporte|BRT corridors]]. Since the failure of its first, rather grandiose, city plan due to lack of funding, Curitiba has focused on working with economical forms of infrastructure, so it has arranged unique adaptations, such as bus routes (inexpensive infrastructure) with routing systems, limited access and speeds similar to subway systems. The source of innovation in Curitiba has been a unique form of participatory city planning that emphasizes public education, discussion and agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cervero|first1=Robert|title=The Transit Metropolis: A Global Inquiry |date=1998 |publisher=Island Press |location=Washington|isbn=9781559635912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Guatemala City, Guatemala====

In an attempt to control rapid growth of [[Guatemala City]], the long-time Mayor of Guatemala City [[Álvaro Arzú]] implemented a plan to control growth based on transects along important arterial roads and exhibiting transit-oriented development (TOD) characteristics. This plan adopted POT (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial) aims to allow the construction of taller, mixed-use building structures right by large arterial roads; the buildings would gradually decrease in height and density the farther they are from arterial roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pot.muniguate.com/ |title=:::... Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial - Tú eres la Ciudad, Municipalidad de Guatemala, cumple ...::: |language=Spanish|publisher=Pot.muniguate.com |date= |accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is simultaneously being implemented along with a [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system called [[Transmetro]].

====Mexico City, Mexico====

Mexico City has battled pollution for years. Many attempts have been made to orient citizens towards public transportation. Expansion of metro line, both subway and bus, have been instrumental. Following the example of Curtiba, many bus-lines were created on many of Mexico City's most important streets. The bus-line has taken two lanes from cars to be used only by the bus-line, increasing the flow for bus transit.

The city has also made great attempts at increasing the number of bikelanes, including shutting down entire roads on certain days to be used only by bikers. 

Car regulations have also increased in the city. New regulations prevent old cars from driving in the city, other cars from driving on certain days. Electric cars are allowed to be driven everyday and have free parking. Decreasing the public space allocated to cars and increasing regulations have become a great annoyance among daily car users. The city hopes to push people to use more public transport.

=====Edmonton, Alberta=====
Most of the suburban high rises were not along major rail lines like other cities until recently, when there has been incentive to do so.  [[Century Park, Edmonton|Century Park]] is a growing condo community in southern Edmonton at the south end of [[Edmonton Light Rail Transit|Edmonton's LRT]].  It will include low to high rise condos, recreational services, shops, restaurants, and a fitness centre.  Edmonton has also had a transit-proximate development for some time in the northeastern suburbs at [[Clareview station|Clareview]] which includes a large park and ride, and low rise apartments among big box stores and associated power center parking.  Edmonton is also looking into some new TODs in various parts of the city.  In the northeast, there are plans to redevelop underutilized land at two sites around existing LRT, Fort Road and [[Stadium station (Edmonton)|Stadium station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/planning_development/old-town-fort-road-redevelopment.aspx |title=Old Town Fort Road Redevelopment |publisher=City of Edmonton |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922103220/http://edmonton.ca/city_government/planning_development/old-town-fort-road-redevelopment.aspx |archivedate=September 22, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/planning_development/stadium-station-transit-oriented-development.aspx |title=Stadium Station Transit Oriented Development |publisher=City of Edmonton |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122075058/http://edmonton.ca/city_government/planning_development/stadium-station-transit-oriented-development.aspx |archivedate=November 22, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the west, there is plans to have some medium density condos in the [[Glenora, Edmonton|Glenora neighbourhood]] along a future LRT route as well as a TOD in the southeast in the [[Strathearn, Edmonton|Strathearn neighbourhood]] along the same future LRT on existing low rise apartments.

=====Ottawa, Ontario=====
Ottawa's City Council has established transit-oriented development (TOD) priority areas in proximity to Ottawa's [[O-train|Light Rail Transit]]. These priority areas are a mix of moderate to high-density transit-supportive developments within a 600-metre walking distance of rapid transit stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ottawa.ca/en/transit-oriented-development-guidelines |title=Transit-Oriented Development Guidelines |publisher=City of Ottawa |accessdate=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Toronto, Ontario=====
Toronto has a longstanding policy of encouraging new construction along the route of its primary [[Yonge–University–Spadina line|Yonge Street subway line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cervero|first1=Robert|title=Urban Transit in Canada: Integration and Innovation at its Best|journal=Transportation Quarterly|date=1986|volume=40|issue=3|pages=293-316|issn=0278-9434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable are the development of the [[Yonge and Eglinton]] area in the 1960s and 1970s; and the [[North York Centre|present development]] of the 2&amp;nbsp;km of the Yonge Street corridor north of Sheppard Avenue, which began in the late 1980s.  In the period since 1997 alone the latter stretch has seen the appearance of a major new [[Empress Walk|shopping centre]] and the building and occupation of over twenty thousand new units of [[condominium]] housing. Since the opening of the [[Sheppard line|Sheppard subway line]] in 2002, there is a [[condominium]] construction boom along the route on Sheppard Avenue East between Yonge Street and Don Mills Road.

===== New Jersey =====
New Jersey has become a national leader in promoting transit oriented development. The [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] established the Transit Village Initiative in 1999, offering multi-agency assistance and grants from the annual $1 million fund to any municipality with a ready-to-go project specifying appropriate mixed land-use strategy, available property, station-area management, and commitment to affordable housing, job growth, and culture. Transit village development must also preserve the architectural integrity of historically significant buildings. Since 1999 the state has made 30 Transit Village designations, which are in different stages of development:

[[Pleasantville, New Jersey|Pleasantville]] (1999), [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] (1999), [[Rutherford, New Jersey|Rutherford]] (1999), [[South Amboy, New Jersey|South Amboy]] (1999), [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] (1999), [[Riverside, Paterson, New Jersey|Riverside]] (2001), [[Rahway, New Jersey|Rahway]] (2002), [[Metuchen, New Jersey|Metuchen]] (2003), [[Belmar, New Jersey|Belmar]] (2003), [[Bloomfield, New Jersey|Bloomfield]] (2003), [[Bound Brook, New Jersey|Bound Brook]] (2003), [[Collingswood, New Jersey|Collingswood]] (2003), [[Cranford, New Jersey|Cranford]] (2003) [[Matawan, New Jersey|Matawan]] (2003), [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] (2005), [[Journal Square]]/[[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] (2005), [[Netcong, New Jersey|Netcong]] (2005), [[Mid-Town Historic District (Elizabeth, New Jersey)|Midtown]] [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] (2007), [[Burlington City, New Jersey|Burlington City]] (2007), [[Orange, New Jersey|Orange]] (2009), [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]] (2010), [[Somerville, New Jersey|Somerville]] (2010), [[Linden, New Jersey|Linden]] (2010), [[West Windsor, New Jersey|West Windsor]] (2012), [[Dunellen, New Jersey|Dunellen]] (2012), [[Plainfield, New Jersey|Plainfield]] (2014), [[Park Ridge, New Jersey|Park Ridge]] (2015), and [[Irvington, New Jersey|Irvington]] (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = FAQ   | work = Transit Village Initiative   | publisher = NJDOT   | date = February 25, 2009   | url = http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/community/village/faq.shtm   | accessdate = August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/about/press/2014/032814.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[East Liberty (Pittsburgh)|East Liberty]] neighborhood is nearing completion of a $150 million Transit Oriented Development centered around the reconfigured East Liberty Station on the city's [[Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway]].&lt;ref&gt;http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/9263121-74/east-liberty-center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2015/01/09/New-platforms-at-East-Liberty-Station-to-open-tomorrow/stories/201501090226&lt;/ref&gt; The development included improved access to the station with a new pedestrian bridge and pedestrian walkways that increase the effective walkshed of the station.  The East Busway is a fixed guideway route that offers riders an 8-minute ride from East Liberty to Pittsburgh's Downtown.

=====Salt Lake City Metro Area, Utah=====
The [[Salt Lake City metropolitan area|Salt Lake City Metro Area]] has seen a strong proliferation of transit-oriented developments due to the construction of new transit lines within the [[Utah Transit Authority]]'s [[TRAX (light rail)|TRAX]], ''[[FrontRunner]]'' and streetcar lines. New developments in [[West Valley City, Utah|West Valley]], [[Farmington, Utah|Farmington]], [[Murray, Utah|Murray]], [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Kaysville, Utah|Kaysville]], [[Sugarhouse (Salt Lake City)|Sugarhouse]] and [[downtown Salt Lake City]] have seen rapid growth and construction despite the economic downturn. The population along the [[Wasatch Front]] has reached 1.7 million and is expected to grow 50% over the next two decades. At 29.8%, Utah's population growth more than doubled the population growth of the nation (13.2%), with a vast majority of this growth occurring along the Wasatch Front.

Transportation infrastructure has been vastly upgraded in the past decade as a result of the [[2002 Olympic Winter Games]] and the need to support the growth in population. This has created a number of transit-oriented commercial and residential projects to be proposed and completed.

Major transit village projects have been developed over the past 20 years at several stations linked to the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) system. In their 1996 book, ''Transit Villages in the 21st Century'', [[Michael S. Bernick|Michael Bernick]] and [[Robert Cervero]] identified emerging transit villages at several BART stations, including [[Pleasant Hill / Contra Costa Centre (BART station)|Pleasant Hill / Contra Costa Centre]], [[Fruitvale (BART station)|Fruitvale]], [[Hayward (BART station)|Hayward]] and [[Richmond Station (California)|Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bernick|first1=Michael|last2=Cervero|first2=Robert|title=Transit Villages in the 21st Century |date=1997 |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York|isbn=9780070054752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MacArthur station (BART)|MacArthur Station]] is a relatively new development, with construction beginning in 2011 and scheduled for completion after 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://macarthurstation.com/masterplan.php|title=Master Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=MacArthur Station|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia and Oceania===

====Hong Kong====
[[File:ShatinTownCentre 20070831.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sha Tin]] town centre, built around the Sha Tin railway station]]
Compared to other developed economies, the car ownership rate in Hong Kong is very low, and approximately 90% of all trips are made by public transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provision of Public Transport Services|url=http://www.td.gov.hk/en/publications_and_press_releases/publications/free_publications/the_third_comprehensive_transport_study/5_coordination_of_different_transport_modes/|website=The Third Comprehensive Transport Study|publisher=Transport Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-20th century, no railway was built until an area was well developed. However, in recent decades, [[Hong Kong]] has started to have some TODs, where a railway is built simultaneously with residential development above or nearby, dubbed the "Rail plus Property" (R+P) Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-rail-plus-property-model|title=The ‘Rail plus Property’ model: Hong Kong’s successful self-financing formula|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

====Malaysia====
{{main article|Bandar Malaysia}}
[[Bandar Malaysia]] is an upcoming development by [[1Malaysia Development Berhad|1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB)]].

====Melbourne, Victoria====
{{main article|Melbourne 2030}}
[[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is expected to reach a population of 5 million by 2030 with the overwhelming majority of its residents relying on private automobiles.  Since the turn of the century, sporadic efforts have been made by various levels of government to implement transit-oriented development principles.  However, a lack of commitment to funding public transport infrastructure, resulting to overcrowding and amending zoning laws has dramatically slowed progress toward [[Sustainability|sustainable development]] for the city.

====Milton, Queensland====
[[Milton, Queensland|Milton]], an inner suburb of [[Brisbane]], has been identified as Queensland's first transit-oriented development under the Queensland Government's [[South East Queensland Regional Plan]]. [[Milton railway station, Brisbane|Milton railway station]] will undergo a multimillion-dollar revamp as part of the development of [[The Milton Residences]] to promote and encourage residents to embrace rail travel. This will include a new ticketing office, new public amenities, increased visibility across platforms and new and improved access points off Milton Road and Railway Terrace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themilton.com.au/transit-oriented-development.html Transit Oriented Development, Sustainable City Living] The Milton. Retrieved on November 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
[[File:Ørestad Karen Blixen Parc.jpg|thumb|Karen Blixen Park, [[Ørestad]] (Copenhagen), Denmark]]
The term transit-oriented development, as a US-born concept, is rarely used in Europe, although many of the measures advocated in transit-oriented development are also stressed here. Many European cities have long been built around transit systems and there has thus often been little or no need to differentiate this type of development with a special term as has been the case in the US. An example of this is Copenhagen's [[Finger Plan]] from 1947, which embodied many transit-oriented development aspects and is still used as an overall planning framework today. Recently, scholars and technicians have taken interest in the concept, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.colloquium.fr/ei/cm.esp?id=565&amp;pageid=_3ET0UVLVD |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715054755/https://www.colloquium.fr/ei/cm.esp?id=565&amp;pageid=_3ET0UVLVD |archivedate=July 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paris, France====
Whereas the city of Paris has a centuries-long history, its main frame dates to the 19th century. The [[Paris Métro|subway network]] was made to solve both linkage between the five main train stations and local transportation assets for citizens. The whole area of Paris City has metro stations no more than 500 metres apart. Recent bicycle and car rental systems ([[Velib]] and [[Autolib]]) also ease travel, in the very same way that TOD emphasizes.So do the new trams linking suburbs close to Paris proper, and tramline 3 around the edge of the city of Paris.

====Stedenbaan, The Netherlands====
In the Southern part of the [[Randstad]] will be built a neighbourhood according to the principles of TOD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinkdeep.nl/documents/Papers/Hoeven.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equity and housing cost concerns==
One criticism of transit-oriented development is that it has the potential to spur [[gentrification]] in low-income areas. In some cases, TOD can raise the housing costs of formerly affordable neighborhoods, pushing low- and moderate-income residents farther away from jobs and transit. When this happens, TOD projects can disrupt low-income neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.dialogue4health.org/pdfs/wf1/transit-oriented-policylink.pdf
 | title = Equitable Development Toolkit: Transit Oriented Development
 | year = 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When executed with equity in mind, however, TOD has the potential to benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities: it can link workers to employment centers, create construction and maintenance jobs, and has the potential to encourage investment in areas that have suffered neglect and economic depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.frbsf.org/publications/community/investments/1008/index.html
 | title = Community Investments: Transit-Oriented Development
 | year = 2010
 | author = Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, it is well recognized that neighborhood development restrictions, while potentially in the immediate neighborhood's best interest, contribute to regional undersupply of housing and drive up the cost of housing in general across a region.  TOD reduces the overall cost of housing in a region by contributing to the housing supply, and therefore generally improves equity in the housing market. TOD also reduces transportation costs, which can have a greater impact on LMI households since they spend a larger share of their income on transportation relative to higher-income households. This frees up household income that can be used on food, education, or other necessary expenses. Low-income people are also less likely to own personal vehicles and therefore more likely to depend exclusively on public transportation to get to and from work, making reliable access to transit a necessity for their economic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:TAYLORTRIKE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Modern upright tricycle]]

A '''tricycle''', often abbreviated to '''trike''',&lt;ref&gt;The Little Book of Trikes. Adam Quellin. Veloce Publishing Ltd, 1 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Hanukkah Trike. Michelle Edwards, Kathryn Mitter. Albert Whitman and Company, 1 Sep 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tilting Trike. Popular Science Jul 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keeping Balance: A Psychologist's Experience of Chronic Illness and Disability. Katherine Cuthbert. Troubador Publishing Ltd, 3 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Human-powered transport|human-powered]] (or gravity-powered) [[Three-wheeler|three-wheeled vehicle]].

Some tricycles, such as [[cycle rickshaw]]s (for passenger transport) and [[freight]] trikes, are used for commercial purposes, especially in the developing world, particularly Africa and Asia.

In the West, adult-sized tricycles are used primarily for [[recreation]], [[shopping]], and [[exercise]]. Tricycles are favoured by children and [[senior adults]] for their apparent stability versus a [[bicycle]]; however a [[Three-wheeler#Two rear|conventional]] trike has poor dynamic lateral stability, and the rider must take care when cornering to avoid tipping the trike over. Unconventional designs such as [[recumbents]] have a lower [[centre of gravity]] so require less care.

==History==
[[File:Rollstuhl Farfler 1655.jpg|thumb|[[Stephan Farffler]]'s hand-controlled three-wheeled wheelchair]]
[[File:سه‌چرخه.jpg|thumb|19th century tricycle used in [[Iran]]]]

A three-wheeled [[wheelchair]] was built in 1655 or 1680 by a disabled German man, [[Stephan Farffler]], who wanted to be able to maintain his mobility. Since he was a watch-maker, he was able to create a vehicle that was powered by hand cranks.&lt;ref name="Greene p. 21"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Free on Three: The Wild World of Human Powered Recumbent Tadpole Tricycles | publisher=iUniverse | author=Steve Greene | year=2011 | pages=21 | isbn=1462021603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Medical Innovations - Wheelchair | journal=Science Reporter | volume=44 | year=2007 | page=397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1789, two French inventors&lt;!---, Blanchard and Maguier----&gt; developed a three-wheeled vehicle, powered by pedals; They called it the tricycle.&lt;ref name="Greene p. 21" /&gt;

In 1818, British inventor Denis Johnson patented his approach to designing tricycles.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} In 1876, James Starley developed the Coventry Lever Tricycle, which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side; power was supplied by hand levers. In 1877, Starley developed a new vehicle he called the Coventry Rotary, which was "one of the first rotary chain drive tricycles." Starley's inventions started a [[Bike boom|tricycling craze]] in Britain; by 1879, there were "twenty types of tricycles and multi-wheel cycles ... produced in Coventry, England, and by 1884, there were over 120 different models produced by 20 manufacturers." The first front steering tricycle was manufactured in 1881 by The Leicester Safety Tricycle Company of Leicester, England, which was brought to the market in 1882 costing £18. They also developed a folding tricycle at the same time.

Tricycles were used by riders who did not feel comfortable on the high wheelers, such as women who wore long, flowing dresses (see [[rational dress]]).

==Associations==
In the UK, upright tricycles are sometimes referred to as "barrows". Many trike enthusiasts in the UK belong to the Tricycle Association, formed in 1929. They participate in day rides, tours, time trials, and a criterium (massed start racing) series. &lt;ref&gt;http://tricycleassociation.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wheel configurations==

===Delta===
A delta tricycle has one front wheel and two rear wheels.&lt;ref name="Jetrike.Com - Tadpole or Delta"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jetrike.com/tadpole-or-delta.html|title=Jetrike.Com - Tadpole or Delta?|website=www.jetrike.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tadpole===
A tadpole tricycle has two front wheels and one rear wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ta-o.html#tadpole|title=Sheldon Brown's Bicycle Glossary Ta - To|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rear wheel steering is sometimes used, although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling (the geometry is similar to a regular tricycle operating in reverse, but with a steering damper added).&lt;ref name="Jetrike.Com - Tadpole or Delta"/&gt;

===Other===
Some early pedal tricycles from the late 19th century used two wheels in tandem on one side and a larger driving wheel on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/tricycle/tricycle.htm|title=Unusual Tricycles.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An in-line three-wheeled vehicle has two steered wheels, one at the front and the other in the middle or at the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclorama.net/viewArticle.php?id=354|title=The Tribent from Turner Recumbents - a Bike Culture article on Cyclorama|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Upright===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}

Upright resembles a two-wheeled bicycle, traditionally [[diamond frame]], or open frame, but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back (called ''delta'') or two wheels at the front (called ''tadpole''). The rider straddles the frame in both delta and tadpole configurations. Steering is through a handlebar directly connected to the front wheel via a conventional bicycle fork in delta, or via a form of [[Ackermann steering geometry]] in the case of the upright tadpole.

All non-tilting trikes have stability issues and great care must be used when riding a non tilting upright trike. The center of gravity is quite high compared to recumbent trikes. Because of this, non-tilting trikes are more prone to tipping over in corners and on uneven or sloping terrain. Conversely, the rider enjoys better visibility than on a recumbent because their head is higher.

===Recumbent===
Recumbent trikes' advantages (over conventional trikes) include stability (through low [[centre of gravity]]) and low [[aerodynamic drag]]. Disadvantages (compared to bicycles) include greater cost, weight, and width. The very low seat may make entry difficult, and on the road they may be less visible to other traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jetrike.com/why-ride-a-trike.html|title=Jetrike.Com - Why Ride a Trike?|website=www.jetrike.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

====Recumbent delta====
[[File:Kettwiesel-rot.jpg|thumb|Delta layout [[Hase Spezialräder]] Kettwiesel]]

Recumbent delta is similar to an upright, with two wheels at the back and one at the front, but has a recumbent layout in which the rider is seated in a chair-like seat. One or both rear wheels can be driven, while the front is used for steering (the usual layout). Steering is either through a linkage, with the handlebars under the seat (under seat steering) or directly to the front wheel with a large handlebar (over seat steering). Some delta trikes can be stored upright by lifting the front wheel and resting the top of the seat on the ground.

Delta trikes generally have higher seats and a tighter turning radius than tadpole trikes. The tight turning radius is necessary if riding on trails with offset barriers, or navigating around closely placed obstacles. The higher seat makes mounting and dismounting easier. Even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight (including the rider) is shifted back towards the rear wheels. Many delta trikes place the seat too far forward and that takes weight off the two rear wheels and puts more weight onto the front wheel making the trike more unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://def-proc.co.uk/b/zydsg|title=Redirecting...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.murraystrikelinks.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Hase Kettwiesel delta trike has an {{Convert|18|in|abbr=on}} high seat that is placed to put most of the weight onto the cambered rear wheels making it more stable.

Delta trikes are suitable to be used as manual scooters for mobility, rehab and/or exercise. The Hase Lepus Comfort is an example of a rehab delta trike designed mainly for comfort and ease of use. It has a lowered front boom and the seat can be adjusted to a height of {{Convert|20|to|28|in|abbr=on}}, which aids in mounting and dismounting. It also has rear wheel suspension for comfort. The {{Convert|56|lb|abbr=on}} Lepus can be folded for easier storage and transportation.

The weight of a delta trike can be quite close to the weight of a tadpole trike if they are both of a similar quality and similar materials are used. The Hase Kettwiesel Allround delta trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 39.4&amp;nbsp;lbs (17.9&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hasebikes.com|title=Startseite – Liegeräder, Tandems, E-Bikes, Handbikes|first=Helmut Pöppel (Grafik-Design, www.hpgrafik.de), Dagmar Uttich (Programmierung,|last=d-u-net.de)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catrike Road tadpole trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 37.5&amp;nbsp;lbs (17&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catrike.com|title=Catrike Recumbent Trikes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recumbent tadpole====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Q-Cycles Njunis in Tadpole Bauform.jpg|thumb|Recumbent tadpole]]

Recumbent tadpole or reverse trike is a recumbent design with two steered wheels at the front and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' stub axle assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a stub axle assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects the left and right axle assemblies.

The tadpole trike is often used by middle-aged or retiree-age former bicyclists who are tired of the associated pains from normal upright bikes. With its extremely low center of gravity, aerodynamic layout and light weight (for trikes), tadpoles are considered the highest performance trikes.

Most [[Velomobile]]s are built in a tadpole trike configuration since a wide front and narrow rear offer superior aerodynamics to a delta trike configuration.

====Recumbent hand trike====
[[File:Bew 75km.JPG|thumb|Racing handcycle]]
{{see also|Handcycle|Para-cycling}}

Hand-crank trikes use a hand-operated crank, either as a sole source of power or a double drive with footpower from pedals and hand-power from the hand crank. The hand-power only trikes can be used by individuals who do not have the use of their legs due to a disability or an injury. They are made by companies including Greenspeed, Invacare, Quickie and Druzin.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In case of paralysis of the legs, more speed and range of distance can be obtained by adding functional electrical stimulation to the legs. The large leg muscles are activated by electrical impulses synchronized with the hand cranking movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edgeryders.eu/en/cycling-for-people-with-paralysis-how-do-we-researchers-and-citizens|title=Cycling for people with paralysis: how do we researchers and citizens contribute to more testing and usability of technologies like FES?|date=2016-09-20|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Im looking for a better reference --&gt;

====Recumbent tandem====
Recumbent tandem trikes allow two people to ride in a recumbent position with an extra-strong backbone frame to hold the extra weight. Some allow the "captain" (the rider who steers) and "stoker" (the rider who only pedals) to pedal at different speeds. They are often made with couplers so the frames can be broken down into pieces for easier transport. Manufacturers of recumbent trikes include Greenspeed, WhizWheelz and Inspired Cycle Engineering (ICE).{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Special purposes===
Some tricycles (such as the Christiania and the Pashley load trike) are designed for load carrying. Others are designed for racing or for comfort. Some recumbent tricycles are fully enclosed for all weather use as well as for aerodynamic benefits; these are known as [[velomobile]]s. Some tricycles, such as the [[Zigo]] Leader, are designed to transport children.

====Tricycle rickshaw====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:National Museum KL 2008 (153).JPG|thumbnail|Two kinds of tricycle rickshaw]]
{{Main article|Cycle rickshaw}}

Most [[cycle rickshaw]]s, used for carrying passengers for hire, are tricycles with one steering wheel in the front and two wheels in the back supporting a seating area for one or two passengers. Cycle rickshaws often have a parasol or canopy to protect the passengers from sun and rain. These vehicles are widely used in South Asia and Southeast Asia, where rickshaw driving provides essential employment for recent immigrants from rural areas, generally impoverished men. In the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, [[rickshaw]]s became increasingly popular in big cities in Britain, Europe and the United States, where they provide urban transportation, novelty rides, and serve as advertising media.

[[File:chariot london.jpg|thumb|Spidertrike]]
Spidertrike is a [[recumbent bicycle|recumbent cycle]] rickshaw that is used in central [[London]] and operated by Eco Chariots. The trike pictured is called the SUV (Sensible Utility Vehicle) and is produced by the company Organic Engines, which operates in [[Florida]] in the United States. It is a front wheel drive tricycle, articulated behind the driver seat, and has [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] double [[disc brake]]s and internal [[hub gear]]s. The passenger is protected from rain and sun with a canopy.

====Freight trike====

[[File:Tricycles in Hailar.JPG|thumb|High-mass counter-direction tricycle]]
{{Further|Freight bicycle|Workbike}}

Urban delivery trikes are designed and constructed for transporting large loads. These trikes include a cargo area consisting of a steel tube carrier, an open or enclosed box, a flat platform, or a large, heavy-duty wire basket. These are usually mounted over one or both wheels, low behind the front wheel, or between parallel wheels at either the front or rear of the vehicle, to keep the center of gravity low. The frame and drivetrain must be constructed to handle loads several times that of an ordinary bicycle; as such, extra low gears may be added. Other specific design considerations include operator visibility and load suspension. Many, but not all, cycles used for the purpose of vending goods such as ice cream cart trikes or hot dog vending trikes are cargo bicycles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Many freight trikes are of the tadpole configuration, with the cargo box (platform, etc.) mounted between the front wheels. India and China are significant strongholds of the rear-loading "delta" carrier trike. Freight trikes are also designed for indoor use in large warehouses or industrial plants. The advantage of using freight trikes rather than a motor vehicle is that there is no exhaust, which means that the trike can be used inside warehouses. While another option is electric golf cart-style vehicles, freight trikes are human-powered, so they do not have the maintenance required to keep batteries on golf carts charged up.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Common uses include:{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
*Delivery services in dense urban environments
*Food vending in high foot traffic areas (including specialist ice cream bikes)
*Transporting trade tools, including around large installations such as power stations and [[CERN]]
*Airport cargo handling
*[[Recycling]] collections
*Warehouse inventory transportation
*Mail
*Food collection
*Child transport (in Amsterdam, freight trikes are used primarily to carry children)

====Children's tricycle====
[[File:Tricycle icon.jpg|thumb|Children's tricycle]]
[[File:SelectivelyeditedTricycle.jpg|thumb|Children's plastic tricycle]]
Compared to adult trikes, children's model are simpler, without brakes or gears, and often with crude front-drive. Tricycles are typically used by children between the ages of two and five, after which point they usually switch to a bicycle, often with training wheels (stabilisers). Child trikes can be unstable, particularly if the [[wheelbase]] or [[Axle track|track]] are insufficient.&lt;ref name="childrenstricyc1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/childrenstricyc_rupf.htm |title=Buying children's tricycle |publisher=Essortment.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trikes have a push bar so adults can control the trike.&lt;ref name="childrenstricyc1"/&gt; Child trikes may have frames made of metal, plastic, or even [[bamboo]].&lt;ref name="bamboochildrenstricyc1"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://xibambam.com/index.php?cat=prod&amp;view=bf&amp;lg=en&amp;spa=products | title = Bamboo children's tricycle | publisher = xibambam.com | accessdate = 2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Budget" child trikes have pedals directly driving the front wheels, for better control of the bike and braking issues but better models (such as the [[Pashley Cycles#Product development, acquisitions and mergers|Pashley Pickle]]) have [[chain drive]] to a single rear wheel. Children's rear-drive trikes lack a differential, so one rear wheel spins free. Rear-drive is preferable to front-drive as most of the rider's weight is on the rear wheels; indeed most front drive trikes are prone to skidding when force is applied to the pedals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Unlike adult bikes, children's trikes do not always have [[Bicycle tire|pneumatic tires]], having instead wheels of solid rubber or hollow plastic. While this may add to the weight of the tricycle and reduces the shock-absorbing qualities, it eliminates the possibility of punctures. Pull brakes are rarely fitted to front-drive trikes, but the child can slow the trike down by resisting the forward motion through the pedals.

A peculiar design, called ''[[wikt:grillo#Italian|grillo]]'' ("cricket" in [[Italian Language|Italian]]), with a half chain, has been popular in [[Italy]] among children for decades, especially for rental in parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grillotricicloperbambini.it/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=117 |title=Il grillo |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=7 December 2014 |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drift trike====
[[Drift trike]]s are a variety of tricycle with slick rear wheels, enabling them to [[drifting (motorsport)|drift]], being countersteered round corners. They are commonly used for gravity-powered descents of paved roads with steep gradients.

====Hand and foot trike====
[[File:Hand &amp; Foot Bike.jpg|thumb|Hand and foot trike]]
With hand and foot trikes, the rider makes a pair of front wheels change directions by shifting the center of weight and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel. The hand and foot trike can be also converted into a manual tricycle designed to be driven with both hands and both feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventorspot.com/inventions/hand_and_foot_trike_10522|title=Hand and Foot Tricycle - Sports and Recreation Bike|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skywheel.kr/|title=스카이휠 홈페이지에 오신 걸 환영합니다|publisher=Skywheel.kr|date=|accessdate=2012-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025090056/http://www.skywheel.kr/|archivedate=2012-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also new hybrids between a handcycle, a recumbent bike and a tricycle, these bikes make it even possible to cycle with legs despite a spinal cord injury.{{Better source|date=July 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkelbike.co.uk |title=The BerkelBike, a hybrid between a recumbentbike and a handcycle |publisher=Berkelbike.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion sets==
Tricycle conversion sets or kits convert a bicycle to an upright tricycle. Tricycle kit can remove the front wheel and mounts two wheels under the handlebars for a quick and easy conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/triblean-tricycle-kit|title=Three-Wheeled Conversion Kits : Triblean Tricycle Kit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages of a trike conversion set include lower cost compared with new hand built tricycles and the freedom to choose almost any donor bicycle frame. Tricycle conversion sets tend to be heavier than a high quality, hand built, sports, touring or racing tricycle. Conversion sets can give the would-be serious tricyclist a taste of triking before making the final decision to purchase a complete tricycle. Conversion sets can also supplied ready to be brazed onto a lightweight, steel bicycle frame to form a complete trike.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Some trike conversion sets can also be used with recumbent bicycles to form recumbent trikes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Operation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}

Adults may find upright tricycles difficult to ride because of familiarity with the [[Countersteering|counter-steering]] required to balance a bicycle. The variation in the [[cant (road/rail)|camber]] of the road is the principal difficulty to be overcome once basic tricycle handling is mastered. Recumbent trikes are less affected by camber and, depending on track width and riding position, capable of very fast cornering. Some trikes are [[tilting three-wheeler]]s, which lean into corners much as bicycles do.

In the case of delta tricycles, the drive is often to just one of the rear wheels, though in some cases both wheels are driven through a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]]. A double [[freewheel]], preferably using no-backlash roller clutches, is considered superior. Trikes with a differential often use an internally geared hub as a gearbox in a 'mid drive' system. A [[jackshaft]] drive permits either single or two-wheel drive. Tadpoles generally use a bicycle's rear wheel drive and for that reason are usually lighter, cheaper and easier to replace and repair.

===Braking===
Some trikes use a geometry (also called center point steering) with the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] axis intersecting the ground directly ahead of the tire contact point, producing a normal amount of trail. This arrangement, elsewhere called "zero scrub radius" is used to mitigate the effects of one-sided braking on steering. While zero scrub can reduce steering feel and increase wandering it can also protect novices from spinning out and/or flipping.

Tadpole trikes tend also to use [[Ackermann steering geometry]], perhaps with both front [[brake]]s operated by the stronger hand. While the KMX Kart stunt trike with this setup allows the rear brake to be operated separately, letting the rider do "bootlegger turns", the standard setup for most trikes has the front brake for each side operated by each hand. The center-of-mass of most tadpole trikes is close to the front wheels, making the rear brake less useful. The rear brake may instead be connected to a latching brake lever for use as a parking brake when stopped on a hill.

Recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand, allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction.

==Manufacturers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Tri-Fecta folded trike jeh.jpg|thumb|Small folded delta trike parked in New York]]
Specialist makers of upright trikes in the UK include [[George Longstaff|Longstaff Cycles]], Higgins (which ceased trading in the 1960s), Trykit and [[Pashley Cycles]]. Italian company [[Di Blasi Industriale S.r.l.|Di Blasi]] make a folding upright trike.

Makers of recumbent trikes include KMX; Hase (who make the Kettwiesel delta, improbably named after the British children's programme [[Catweazle]]); Inspired Cycle Engineering, who make the Trice range of tadpole trikes; AVD, who build the record-holding [[Mike Burrows|Burrows]] Windcheetah or Speedy, now exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art (MoMA); Australia's Greenspeed, one of the oldest manufacturers; Michigan-based WhizWheelz, whose ten models include a tadpole and a tandem; Big Cat HPV, which builds the eight [[Catrike]] models in Florida; and Sidewinder Cycle, which has a front wheel drive system with rear wheel steering builds 3 models all with Electric assist capability located in California.

The largest manufacturer of recumbent trikes is Sun Bicycles of [[Taiwan]] who make both tadpole and delta trikes. The deltas are built from designs licensed from Gardner Martin's EasyRacers, a leading builder of recumbent bicycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5723">[[Image:Vap-Liq Separator.png|thumb|246px|A typical vapor–liquid separator including commonly a de-entrainment pad and sometimes an inlet distributor.]]

A '''vapor–liquid separator''' is a device used in several industrial applications to separate a vapor–liquid [[mixture]].

A vapor–liquid separator may also be referred to as a ''flash drum'', ''breakpot'', ''knock-out drum'' or ''knock-out pot'', ''compressor suction drum'' or ''compressor inlet drum''. When used to remove suspended water droplets from streams of air, it is often called  a [[Demister (Vapor)|thermister]].

== Method of operation ==
For the common variety, [[gravity]] is utilized in a vertical vessel to cause the liquid to settle to the bottom of the vessel, where it is withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Baasel|title=Preliminary Chemical engineering Plant Design|edition=2nd|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|year=1990|isbn=0-442-23440-6|oclc=18907139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David H.F. Liu|title=Environmental Engineers' Handbook|edition=2nd|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-8493-9971-8|oclc=35886123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stanley S. Grossel|date=June 2004|title=Design and sizing of knock-out drums/catchtanks for emergency relief systems|journal=Plant/Operations Progress ([[AIChE]])|volume=5|issue=3|pages=129–135|issn=0278-4513|doi=10.1002/prsb.720050304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley M. Walas|title=Chemical Process Equipment:Selection and Design|edition= |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=1988|isbn=0-409-90131-8|oclc=16714037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[low gravity]] environments such as a [[space station]], a common liquid separator will not function because gravity is not usable as a separation mechanism. In this case, [[centrifugal force]] needs to be utilised in a spinning [[centrifuge|centrifugal separator]] to drive liquid towards the outer edge of the chamber for removal. Gaseous components migrate towards the center.

For both varieties of separator, the gas outlet may itself be surrounded by a spinning mesh screen or grating, so that any liquid that does approach the outlet strikes the grating, is accelerated, and thrown away from the outlet. 

The vapor travels through the gas outlet at a design velocity which minimises the [[Entrainment (engineering)|entrainment]] of any liquid droplets in the vapor as it exits the vessel.

The feed to a vapor–liquid separator may also be a liquid that is being partially or totally [[Flash evaporation|''flashed'']] into a vapor and liquid as it enters the separator.

=== Liquid level monitoring ===
The separator is only effective as long as there is an air space inside the chamber. The separator can fail if either the mixed inlet is overwhelmed with supply material, or the liquid drain is unable to handle the volume of liquid being collected. The separator may therefore be combined with some other liquid level sensing mechanism such as a [[sight glass]] or [[Float (liquid level)|float sensor]]. In this manner, both the supply and drain flow can be regulated to prevent the separator from becoming overloaded. (Agastya, Bayu)

==Where vapor–liquid separators are used==
Vapor–liquid separators are very widely used in a great many industries and applications, such as:

*[[Oil refinery|Oil refineries]]
*[[Natural gas processing|Natural-gas processing plants]] (NGL)
*[[Petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s
*[[Refrigeration|Refrigeration systems]]
*[[Air conditioning]]
*[[Gas compressor|Compressor systems]]
*[[Pipeline transport|Gas pipelines]]
*Steam condensate flash drums
*Geothermal power plants
*Combined cycle power plants
*[[Flare stack]]s
*[[Soil vapor extraction]] 
*[[Paper mill]]s

== Preventing pump damage ==
In refrigeration systems, it is common for the system to contain a mixture of liquid and gas, but for the mechanical gas compressor to be intolerant of liquid.

Some [[Gas compressor|compressor]] types such as the [[scroll compressor]] use a continuously shrinking compression volume. Once liquid completely fills this volume the pump may either stall and overload, or the pump chamber may be warped or otherwise damaged by the fluid that can not fit into a smaller space.

{{Audio|Wilhelm Maybach.ogg|'''Wilhelm Maybach'''}} ({{IPA-de|ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈmaɪbax}}; 9 February 1846 – 29 December 1929) was an early German engine designer and industrialist. During the 1890s he was hailed in France, then the world centre for car production, as the "King of Designers".

From the late 19th century Wilhelm Maybach, together with [[Gottlieb Daimler]], developed light, high-speed internal combustion engines suitable for land, water, and air use. These were fitted to the world's first motorcycle, motorboat, and after Daimler's death, a new automobile introduced in late 1902, the [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] model, built to the specifications of [[Emil Jellinek]].

Maybach rose to become technical director of the [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG) but did not get on well with its chairmen. As a result, Maybach left DMG in 1907 to found [[Maybach|Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH]] together with his son Karl in 1909; they manufactured [[Zeppelin]] engines. After the signing of the [[Versailles Treaty]] in 1919 the company started producing large luxury vehicles, branded as "Maybach". The company joined the German war effort in 1940, ceasing automotive production in favour of tank engines, including those for the [[Tiger I]] and [[Tiger II]] [[heavy tank]]s.

Revived after the war Maybach Motorenbau which remained a subsidiary of [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin]] was making diesel engines. During the 1960s Maybach came under the control of Daimler-Benz and was renamed [[MTU Friedrichshafen]].

In 2002 the ''Maybach'' brand name was revived for a luxury make but it was not successful. On 25 November 2011 Daimler-Benz announced they would cease producing automobiles under the ''Maybach'' brand name in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2014, Daimler announced production of an ultra-luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class under the new Mercedes-Maybach brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-11/mercedes-revives-maybach-name-to-challenge-rolls-royce.html |work=Bloomberg |first=Dorothee |last=Tschampa |title=Mercedes Revives Maybach Name to Challenge Rolls-Royce |date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career beginnings (1846 to 1869) ==

Wilhelm Maybach was born in [[Heilbronn]], [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1846, the son of a carpenter and his wife Luise. He had four brothers. When he was eight years old the family moved from [[Löwenstein]] near Heilbronn to [[Stuttgart]]. His mother died in 1856 and his father in 1859.

After his relatives published an announcement in the ''Stuttgarter Anzeiger'' newspaper, a philanthropic institution at [[Reutlingen]] took in Maybach as a student. Its founder and director, [[:de:Gustav Werner|Gustav Werner]], discovered Maybach's technical inclination and helped to stimulate his career by sending him to the school's engineering workshop. At 15 years old (1861), Maybach was heading for a career in [[Industrial design]] and took extra classes in physics and mathematics at Reutlingen's public high school.

By the time he was 19 years old, he was a qualified designer working on stationary engines. His workshop manager, Gottlieb Daimler, then 29, noticed his efforts and took him on as his main assistant, a post he held until Daimler's death in 1900.

==Daimler and Otto's four-stroke engine (1869 to 1880)==

In 1869, Maybach followed Daimler to [[Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe AG]] in [[Karlsruhe]], a manufacturer of heavy locomotives. Daimler was on the Executive Committee and they spent long nights discussing new designs for engines, pumps, lumber machinery, and metalworking.

In 1872, Daimler moved to [[Deutz AG|Deutz-AG-Gasmotorenfabrik]] in [[Cologne]], then the world's largest manufacturer of stationary gas engines. [[Nikolaus Otto]], part owner of the company, focused on engine development with Daimler. Maybach joined them as Chief Designer.

In 1876, Nikolaus Otto patented the [[Otto cycle]] engine. It was a [[four-stroke cycle]] gas internal combustion engine with intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes. One of Otto's more than 25 patents on this engine was later challenged and overturned, allowing Daimler and Maybach to produce their high-speed engine.

Also in 1876, Maybach was sent to show Deutz's engines at the [[World Fair|Philadelphia World's Fair (USA)]]. On returning to Cologne in 1877, he concentrated on improving the four-stroke design to prepare it for its impending commercial launch.

In 1878, Maybach married Bertha Wilhelmine Habermaas, a friend of Daimler's wife, Emma Kunz. Her family members were landowners who ran the post office in [[Maulbronn]]. On 6 July 1879 Karl Maybach was born, the first of their three children.

In 1880, Daimler and Otto had serious disagreements, resulting in Daimler's leaving Deutz-AG. Daimler received 112,000 [[German gold mark|goldmarks]] in Deutz-AG shares as compensation for patents granted to him and Maybach. Maybach also left shortly afterwards, and followed his friend to found a new company in [[Cannstatt]].

[[File:Stuttgart-cannstatt-daimler-boot-neckar-1886.jpg|thumb|Daimler 1885 Engine in a boat]]
In 1882, Maybach moved to Taubenheimstrasse in Cannstatt, Stuttgart, where Daimler had purchased a house with 75,000 goldmarks from his Deutz compensation. They added a brick extension to the glass-fronted summer house in the garden, which became their workshop.

Their activities alarmed the neighbours, who suspected they were engaged in counterfeiting. The police raided the property in their absence using the gardener's key, but found only engines.

==The Daimler Engine==
In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach patented the first of their engines fueled by [[Ligroin]]. This engine was patented on December 16, 1883. It achieved Daimler's goal of being small and running fast enough to be useful at 750 rpm (soon after up to 900). Daimler had three engines built in 1884. Maybach persuaded him to put one in a vehicle, the result being the [[Reitwagen]].&lt;ref name="Dreams to Automobiles"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson|first1=Len|title=Dreams to Automobiles|date=December 4, 2008|publisher=Xlibris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSCLAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT181&amp;lpg=PT181&amp;dq=1883+daimler+dream+engine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ozZOxUz61V&amp;sig=9SZzmYPfopvX5JAQRjtRZB-TNlU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv2dnQsN7NAhUMzIMKHavGB58Q6AEILDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1883%20daimler%20dream%20engine&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name=Haug&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haug|first1=Gunter|title=Gottlieb Daimler - Der Traum vom Fahren: Historischer Roman|date=August 15, 2010|publisher=Masken-Verlag Friedrich Willmann;|isbn=3939500275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Maybach's second son Adolf was born.

== The Grandfather Clock engine (1885) ==

By the end of 1885, Maybach and Daimler developed the first of their engines, which is regarded as a precursor to all modern [[Gasoline engine|petrol engines]]. It featured:
* single vertical cylinder
* air cooling
* large cast-iron [[flywheel]]
* revolutionary [[Hot-tube ignitor|hot tube]] ignition (Patent 28022)
* exhaust [[valve]] controlled by a [[camshaft]] allowing high speeds 
* a speed of 600 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], when at the time most engines could only achieve about 120 to 180 rpm.

In 1885, they created the first [[carburetor]], which mixed evaporated [[gasoline]] with air to allow its efficient use as fuel. It was used that year on a larger but still compact version of the engine, now with a vertical cylinder, that featured:
* 1 [[Horsepower]] at 600 rpm output 
* 100 cc [[engine displacement]] 
* non cooled insulated cylinder with unregulated hot-tube ignition (patent DRP-28-022)
Daimler baptized it the ''Standuhr'' ([[Longcase clock|Grandfather Clock]]) because of its resemblance to a pendulum clock.

In November 1885, Daimler installed a smaller version of the engine into a wooden bicycle, creating the first motorcycle (patent 36-423 - Vehicle with gas or petroleum engine), and Maybach drove it three kilometers from Cannstatt to [[Untertürkheim]], reaching {{convert|12|km/h|abbr=on}}. It became known as the [[Daimler Reitwagen|''Reitwagen'']].

On 8 March 1886, the inventors bought  an American model coach built by Wilhelm Wimpff &amp; Sohn, telling the neighbors that it was a birthday gift for Mrs. Daimler. Maybach supervised the installation of an enlarged 1.5&amp;nbsp;hp Grandfather Clock engine into the coach, and installed a  belt drive to the wheels. The vehicle reached {{convert|15|km/h|abbr=on}} when tested on the road to Untertürkheim.&lt;ref&gt;https://mercedes-benz-publicarchive.com/marsPublic/en/instance/ko/Daimler-motor-carriage-1886.xhtml?oid=5903&lt;/ref&gt;

Maybach and Daimler went on to prove the engine in many other ways, including:
* On water (1887). It was mounted in a 4.5-metre-long boat which achieved 6 knots (11&amp;nbsp;km/h). The boat was called the ''[[Neckar]]'' after the river it was tested on and was registered as patent number DRP 39-367. Motor boat engines would become their main product until the first decade of the 1900s.
* More road vehicles, including street cars
* In the air. They built the first motorized airship, a balloon based on designs by Dr. [[Friedrich Hermann Wölfert]] from Leipzig. They replaced his hand-operated drive system and flew over Seelberg successfully on 10 August 1888.

By 1887 they were licensing their first patents abroad, and Maybach represented the company at the great Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]].

Sales increased, mostly from the Neckar motorboat. In June 1887, Daimler bought land in the Seelberg Hills of Cannstatt. The workshop was some distance from the town on Ludwig Route 67, because Cannstatt's mayor objected to the presence of the workshop in the town. It covered 2,903&amp;nbsp;square meters and cost 30,200 goldmarks. They initially employed 23 people. Daimler managed the commercial issues and Maybach the design department.

In 1889 they built their first automobile to be designed from scratch rather than as an adaptation of a stagecoach. It was publicly launched by both inventors in Paris in October 1889.

Daimler's engine licenses began to be taken up throughout the world, starting the modern car industry in:
* France, 1890, [[Panhard|Panhard &amp; Levassor]] and [[Peugeot]]
* United Kingdom, 1896, The Daimler Motor Company of Coventry
* United States of America, 1891, [[Steinway]]
* [[Austro-Daimler]] in Austria, starting in 1899

== Daimler's "pact with the devil", DMG, and the Phoenix engine (1890 to 1900) ==

Resources were scant to keep the business going, as neither the engine sales nor the worldwide proceeds from their patents were yielding enough money. Fresh capital was injected by bringing in the financiers [[Max von Duttenhofer]] and [[William Lorenz]], former munitions makers, who were associated with [[Kilian von Steiner]], the owner of a German investment bank. The company was taken public.

In 1890, Daimler and Maybach together founded the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, the Daimler Motor Corporation or DMG for short, which was dedicated to the construction of small high-speed internal combustion engines for land, water, or air transport. Maybach was Chief Designer. After spending long hours debating which fuel was best to use in Otto's four-stroke engine, which had normally used [[methane|methane gas]] as a fuel, they turned to [[petroleum]] which until then had been used mainly as a cleaner and sold in pharmacies.

The company's re-foundation took place on 28 November 1890. This has been regarded as a "pact with the devil" by some German historians,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
as the following decade was chaotic for Daimler and Maybach. DMG continued to expand, selling engines from Moscow to New York, and additional stationary engine-making capacity was added, but the belief continued that automobile production would not be profitable. The new chairmen planned to merge ''DMG'' and ''Deutz-AG'', in spite of Daimler's disagreement with Nikolaus Otto.

Gottlieb Daimler and Chief Engineer Maybach preferred to produce automobiles and reacted against Duttenhofer and Lorenz in particular. Maybach was rejected as a member of the Board of Management and left the company on 11 February 1891, and continued his design work from his own house, financed by Daimler. In late 1892, he set up a shop in the ballroom of the former Hermann Hotel and Winter Garden where he employed 17 workers, five of which were paid by Daimler.

In 1894 Maybach designed his third engine model, together with Daimler and his son Paul. Used in the Phoenix, it gained worldwide attention, pioneering the use of four cylinders in the automobile and featuring:
* single block casting of cylinders, arranged vertically and parallel to each other
* camshaft controlled exhaust valves
* spray-nozzle carburetor (patented by Maybach in 1893)
* improved belt drive

Maybach's creations are considered among the finest motors of the late 19th century. His inventions became indispensable for any model by any automaker in the world. He became recognised as the backbone of France's early automobile industry, where he was hailed as the "King of Designers".

Daimler was forced out of his post as Technical Director at DMG and resigned in 1893, which damaged DMG's prestige. However, in 1894, a British industrialist, [[Frederick Simms]], purchased the rights to the Phoenix engine for 350,000 marks and stabilised the company's finances. He also made it a condition that Daimler be re-employed. In 1895 DMG assembled its 1,000th engine, and Maybach also returned as Chief Engineer, obtaining 30,000 goldmarks worth of shares through his original contract with Gottlieb Daimler.

Maybach patented more automobile inventions, including:
* a revolutionary cooling system, tubular [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] with fan
* the honeycomb radiator&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-Mercedes-35-hp.htm Mercedes 35 hp&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.seriouswheels.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time though Maybach suffered two setbacks. His teenage second son, Adolf, suffered a [[schizophrenia]] attack and spent the rest of his life in various mental institutions. (In 1940, his son was murdered by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazis]] as part of the [[T-4 Euthanasia Program|Euthanasia Program]].) In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler died of heart disease.

Between April and October 1900, Maybach designed a completely new kind of car inspired by racing which would be called the [[Mercedes 35 hp]] when released in 1902. It featured:
* long wheelbase
* wide track
* low height 
* unheard-of power from its 35&amp;nbsp;hp engine allowing it to reach {{convert|75|km/h|abbr=on}}. 
[[Emil Jellinek]], a successful Austrian dealer and racing driver on the [[French Riviera]] who greatly admired Maybach's work, promised to buy a shipment of 36 automobiles for 550,000 goldmarks if Maybach could design a great [[race car]] for him following his specifications.

The prototype was finished in December 1900 and, in 1901 went on to have a string of racing successes. Its engine was baptized Daimler-Mercedes (Spanish for mercy) after [[Mercedes Jellinek]], Emil's 10–year–old daughter. European high society bought the car in large numbers making it the commercial success that convinced the company directors there was a future in automobiles. Production increased greatly and DMG rapidly increased in size and number of employees. DMG officially registered the Mercedes trademark in June 1902.

In 1902, a fire destroyed DMG's Cannstatt facilities and the company moved to Stuttgart-[[Untertürkheim]]. Maybach continued with his innovations: 
* a 6-cylinder/70&amp;nbsp;hp engine (1903–04)
* a pioneer aircraft engine: a high speed racing engine of 120&amp;nbsp;hp, with overhead inlet and exhaust valves and [[Ignition system|double ignition]] (1906)

DMG demoted him to an "Inventor's Office" causing him to leave the company again in 1907. DMG replaced him with Paul Daimler. That same year, the German Engineers Association (VDI) recognized Wilhelm Maybach as an honorary member.

==Zeppelin engines (1908)==

[[File:LZ4 after Echterdingen disaster.jpg|thumb|213px|Wreckage of ''LZ4'']]
In 1900, Maybach had had his first contact with Count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] who sought to improve the engines of the [[Zeppelin LZ1]] airship. Maybach built some engines for him based on sketches of a 150&amp;nbsp;hp unit created by his son, Karl, while at DMG.

In 1908, Count Zeppelin attempted to sell his models ''LZ3'' and ''LZ4'' to the government. On 5 August, ''LZ4'' exploded against a row of trees after attempting an emergency landing when its engines failed. This was far from being the end for the airship project as 6.25&amp;nbsp;million goldmarks were raised in a donation campaign after the accident. Count Zeppelin founded the [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin]] GmbH, the company that built the Zeppelin airships.

Maybach had to hold off joining the new company for a while as he was still in litigation with DMG, so Karl took his place. On 23 March 1909, a deal was finally signed, creating an engine subsidiary to Luftschiffbau Zeppelin at [[Bietigheim-Bissingen|Bissingen]]/Enz, in [[Württemberg]]. Wilhelm Maybach was Technical Assistant and Karl was Technical Manager. Their first designs reached 72&amp;nbsp;km/h (45&amp;nbsp;mph).

Wilhelm Maybach moved his company to [[Friedrichshafen]] and renamed it ''Luftfahrzeug-Motoren-GmbH''. Karl and Wilhem held 20% of the shares with an arrangement for Karl to inherit. They kept supplying ''Zeppelin'', but worked on other airship engines too. In 1912, the company adopted the name Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH (Maybach Engine Construction Company). In 1916, they developed a 160&amp;nbsp;hp aircraft engine which sold 2000 units before the end of [[World War I]]. In 1916, Wilhelm Maybach was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the Technical [[University of Stuttgart]].

==Maybach automobiles (1922-1945)==
After the First World War, the [[Versailles Treaty]] of 1919 prohibited airship production in Germany, so Maybach turned to making high-speed diesel engines for naval and railroad use, and petrol engines for automobiles, but not complete automobiles.

Many of the small automakers in Germany built their own engines for cost reasons and only the Dutch [[Spyker]] company was interested in taking Maybach engines. Wilhelm Maybach turned down the contract because he could not agree to its conditions. Instead, he opted to build complete automobiles and the factory began to produce Maybach limousines in 1921.

The first model, the Maybach W3, was shown at the 1921 Automobile Exposition in Berlin and featured
* 6-cylinder engine
* 4-wheel brakes
* new transmission system
* maximum speed of {{convert|105|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}
It was produced until 1928, selling 300 units, mostly with sedan bodies; the two-seat sport version was less successful. The Maybach W5 followed, with the top speed increased to {{convert|135|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}; 250 units sold in 1927 and 1929.
[[File:Maybach Zeppelin DS 8, 1938-39 - DSC06774.JPG|thumb|Maybach Zeppelin DS 8, 1938-39, exhibited in the Zeppelin Museum Friedrichshafen, Seestraße 22, Friedrichshafen, Germany.]]
Next Maybach produced the V12 car:
* the first 12-cylinder German automobile
* lightweight aluminium engine based on his airship work
* light alloy pistons
* 7-litre capacity 
* high torque and power - {{convert|150|hp|abbr=on}} at 2,800 rpm
Only a few dozen were sold due to the German postwar economic crisis. In 1930, its successor, the DS7-Zeppelin, also featured a 12-cylinder engine of 7 liters.

In August 1929, the Zeppelin LZ-127 used five Maybach-V12 petrol engines of {{convert|550|hp|abbr=on}} each.

Neither Wilhelm nor Karl owned a Maybach automobile.&lt;ref&gt;Neiman, Dr. Harry. "Wilhelm Maybach The Father of the Mercedes"(1996). p. 154. Mercedes-Benz AG: Stuttgart-Unterturkheim, Max-Gerrit von Pein. {{ISBN|978-3-613-01717-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm never even owned a car. "He, who created the basics for the modern automobilism, rarely utilized a car for his personal purposes. He walked or took the tram. Although he could have afforded one, he did not own a car."&lt;ref&gt;Rathke, Karl. "Wilhelm Maybach – von der Pferdekutsche zum Mercedes-Wagen"&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm Maybach died at the age of 83 in [[Stuttgart]] on 29 December 1929.

==Maybach Motorenbau GmbH==
His business, Maybach Motorenbau GmbH continued in [[Friedrichshafen]]. After 1945 it manufactured a full range of diesel engines. In the early 1960s Maybach began to construct large Daimler-Benz engines in Friedrichshafen under a licence agreement&lt;ref&gt;Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft. ''The Times'', Saturday, Sep 08, 1962; pg. 13; Issue 55491&lt;/ref&gt; and entered close collaboration with Daimler-Benz.&lt;ref&gt;Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft. ''The Times'', Thursday, Oct 24, 1963; pg. 21; Issue 55840&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid 1960s Maybach Motorenbau GmbH became Maybach Mercedes-Benz Motorenbau GmbH and 83 percent owned by Daimler-Benz.&lt;ref&gt;Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft. ''The Times'', Monday, Sep 25, 1967; pg. 22; Issue 57055&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Mercedes-Benz announced what would prove to be a temporary revival of the Maybach brand for automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;BMW secures Rolls-Royce marque in deal with rival. ''The Times'', Wednesday, July 29, 1998; pg. 23; Issue 66266&lt;/ref&gt; Daimler currently produces an ultra luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class under the Mercedes-Maybach brand.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Wiring''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] electronics prototyping platform composed of a [[programming language]], an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), and a [[single-board microcontroller]]. It was developed starting in 2003 by [[Hernando Barragán]].

Barragán started the project at the [[Interaction Design Institute Ivrea]]. The project is currently developed at the School of Architecture and Design at the [[University of the Andes, Colombia|Universidad de Los Andes]] in Bogotá, Colombia.

Wiring builds on [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]], an open project initiated by [[Casey Reas]] and [[Benjamin Fry]], both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the [[MIT Media Lab]].

The documentation was created with software designers and artists in mind.{{cn|date=November 2017}}  Project experts, intermediate developers, and beginners from around the world share ideas, knowledge and their collective experience as a project community. Wiring makes it easy to create software for controlling devices attached to the electronics board to create all kinds of interactive devices. The concept of developing is to write a few lines of code, connect a few electronic components to the Wiring hardware and observe, for example, that a motion sensor controls a light when a person approaches it, write a few more lines, add another sensor, and see how this light changes when the illumination level in a room decreases. This process is called sketching with hardware; explore ideas quickly, select the more interesting ones, refine and produce prototypes in an iterative process.

==Software==
The Wiring IDE is a [[cross-platform]] application written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] which is derived from the IDE made for the [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]] programming language. It is designed to introduce programming and sketching with electronics to artists and designers.  It includes a code editor with features such as [[syntax highlighting]], [[brace matching]], and automatic indentation capable of compiling and uploading programs to the board with a single click.

The Wiring IDE includes a [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] library called "Wiring", which makes common input/output operations much easier.  Wiring programs are written in a dialect of C and C++.  A minimal program requires only two functions:
*{{code|setup()}}: a function run once at the start of a program which can be used to define initial environment settings.
*{{code|loop()}}: a function called repeatedly until the board is powered off or reset.

A typical first program for a developer using a microcontroller is to blink a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) on and off. In the Wiring environment, the user might write a program like this:

&lt;source lang="arduino"&gt;
int ledPin = WLED;               // a name for the on-board LED

void setup () {
   pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      // configure the pin for digital output
}

void loop () {
   digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);   // turn on the LED
   delay (1000);                 // wait one second (1000 milliseconds)
   digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    // turn off the LED
   delay (1000);                 // wait one second
}
&lt;/source&gt;

When the user clicks the "Upload to Wiring hardware" button in the IDE, a copy of the code is written to a temporary file including a standard header file at the file beginning, and a simple [[main function]] appended.

The Wiring IDE uses the [[GNU toolchain]] and [[AVR Libc]] to compile programs, and uses [[avrdude]] to upload programs to the board.

==Open-source hardware and software==
The Wiring hardware reference designs are distributed under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and are available on the Wiring Web site. Layout and production files for the Wiring hardware are also available. The source code for the IDE and the hardware library are available and released under the [[GPLv2]]

==Related projects==
===Processing===
Wiring was based on the original work done on [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]] project in MIT.

===Arduino and Fritzing===
Wiring and Processing have spawned another project, [[Arduino]], which uses the Processing IDE, with a simplified version of the C++ language, as a way to teach artists and designers how to program [[microcontroller]]s. There are now two separate hardware projects, Wiring and Arduino, using the Wiring environment and language.

[[Fritzing]] is another software environment within this family, which supports designers and artists to document their interactive prototypes and to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product.
