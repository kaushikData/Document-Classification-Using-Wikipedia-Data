The '''1950s House''' is a hands-on exhibit building at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. The exhibit is designed to allow museum visitors to experience everyday life in 1950s Vermont.

The ''1950s House'', which opened at the Shelburne Museum in 2000, brings to life the transformative history of America during the mid-20th century when a vibrant consumer culture developed after [[World War II]].  Having been built in the 1940s, it is outfitted in the late-1940s design and decoration. The furnishings and decor highlight the industrial boom of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Packed with the era’s fashionable furniture, books, toys, food, and magazines, the ''1950s House'' provides a window into mid-century visual culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shelburne Museum &amp;#124; 1950 House &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613055522/http://shelburnemuseum.org/explore/buildings/historic-houses-and-community-buildings/1950-house/|accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cbignore}}

==History==
[[Shelburne, Vermont]] town residents Frank and Helen LaFlam built the ''1950s House'' on land purchased in 1948 from the subdivision of a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm. In 1950 Vermont had abundant land and natural resources and the town of Shelburne, which did not institute zoning until 1957, encouraged new home building.

In designing their house, the LaFlams’ incorporated state-of-the-art amenities such as [[central heating]], public water, and modern bathroom and kitchen appliances including a [[refrigerator]] and built-in cabinets. The burgeoning industry of the late 1940s enabled the LaFlams to purchase a ready-cut house (''see'' [[prefabricated home]]) modeled from architectural plans and specifications that was inexpensive and easily shipped to the building site. The one-story design, attached garage, plain overhanging eaves, and simple white [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]] siding represent the hallmarks of mid-century house design. The LaFlams detailed the windows and doors with broad, stained wood trim, which is the kind of simple detailing available in a lumber-rich place like Vermont.  The house, which is neither a traditional cape nor a typical ranch, has characteristics of do-it-yourself construction, with an engagingly awkward mix-and-match of new and old, typical and idiosyncratic, details.
In the summer of 2000, the house was opened to the public as a temporary exhibition entitled "The Fabulous 50's: Welcome Home to Postwar Vermont".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Louie|first=Elaine|title=Currents:Period House; 'Burbs Fresh From the Frigidaire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/03/garden/currents-period-house-burbs-fresh-from-the-frigidaire.html?src=pm|accessdate=2 October 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the exhibition was extended through 2005.&lt;ref name="Old House Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Old House Journal|date=November–December 2002|volume=30|issue=6|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ob3liF2nZvYC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=c_hceSQV9c&amp;dq=editor%20Shelburne%201950's%20House&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=shelburne&amp;f=false|title=Old-House Journal|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 4, 2012 the 1950s house was torn down to make way for another exhibit.

'''UNESCO Nomenclature''' (more properly '''UNESCO nomenclature for fields of science and technology''') is a system developed by [[UNESCO]] for [[Categorization|classification]] of research papers and [[doctoral dissertation]]s. There are three versions of the system, offering different levels of refinement through [[UNESCO Nomenclature|2]]-, 4-, and [[6-digit UNESCO Nomenclature|6]]-digit codes. This article describes the 4-digit nomenclature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6935">'''"Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress"''' is a letter by [[Benjamin Franklin]] dated June 25, 1745, in which Franklin counsels a young man about channeling sexual urges.  Due to its licentious nature the letter was not published in collections of Franklin's papers in the [[United States]] during the 19th century.  Federal court decisions from the mid- to late- 20th century cited the document as a reason for overturning obscenity laws.

==Text==
Franklin begins by advising a young man that a cure for sexual urges is unknown, and the proper solution is to take a wife.  Then, expressing doubts that the intended reader will actually marry, Franklin names several advantages of marriage.  As supplementary advice in case the recipient rejects all previous arguments, Franklin lists seven reasons why an older mistress is preferable to a young one.  Advantages include better conversation, less risk of unwanted pregnancy, and ''greater prudence in conducting an intrigue.''&lt;ref name="franklin"&gt;Benjamin Franklin, "[http://www.bibliomania.com/2/9/77/124/21473/1/frameset.html Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress]" (accessed 19 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Richard Stevens, the unnamed correspondent is a friend of Franklin's named Cadwaller Colton, and it remains unknown whether Franklin was serious or if the letter was ever delivered.&lt;ref&gt;John Richard Stevens, ''Weird History 101: My Dinner with Attila the Hun, I Started World War I'', Adams Media, 1997 p. 219.  {{ISBN|1-55850-715-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether serious or humorous, the letter is frankly sexual:
{{quote|The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.&lt;ref name="franklin" /&gt;}}

==Censorship==
The Mistress letter was not the only document by Franklin that later generations censored.  The bawdy portion of Franklin's writing was accepted during his own era.  Although the Mistress letter was not published during his lifetime, Franklin's public works include an essay called "[[Fart Proudly]]".  A passage from his ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Autobiography]]'' describes an unsuccessful attempt to seduce a friend's mistress.  As John Semonche observes in ''Censoring Sex: A Historical Journey Through American Media'', the autobiography was widely read during the 19th century because of its moral lessons, but the passage about the failed seduction was variously altered or deleted entirely.&lt;ref name="semonche14"&gt;John Semonche, ''Censoring Sex: A Historical Journey Through American Media'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mistress letter was omitted from 19th century publications of Franklin's works, and by some accounts it was singled out for suppression.&lt;ref name="semonche14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="werbel"&gt;Amy Beth Werbel, ''Thomas Eakins: Art, Medicine, and Sexuality in Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia'', Yale University Press, 2007, p. 161.  {{ISBN|0-300-11655-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This censorship occurred both informally and under law.&lt;ref&gt;Semonche, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first state to enact obscenity legislation was [[Vermont]] in 1821.  During the following decades every state except [[New Mexico]] adopted similar laws.&lt;ref&gt;Semonche, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Then the [[Comstock laws|Comstock Act]] of 1873 made it a federal crime to circulate "obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious" material through the mail.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Kevles, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/22/books/the-secret-history-of-birth-control.html?pagewanted=print The Secret History of Birth Control]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 22 July 2001 (accessed 19 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Franklin had mistresses throughout his life (including one still-unknown mistress who bore his only son [[William Franklin]]), such circumstances were incompatible with patriotic sensibilities a century afterward.&lt;ref name="werbel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, pp. 219-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amy Beth Werbel opines bluntly:

{{quote|At a time when America was scant one hundred years old, Benjamin Franklin was an important part of its founding mythology.  Some Americans felt it their patriotic duty to hide the fact that the conqueror of electricity and continental congressman was also a raunchy (and probably unfaithful) lout.&lt;ref name="werbel" /&gt;}}

==Citations==
By the mid-20th century, United States federal judges were citing the letter in [[originalism|originalist]] reasoning to overturn [[obscenity]] laws.  A [[Jerome Frank (lawyer)|Jerome Frank]] appellate opinion of 1957 named "Advice to a Young Man on Choosing a Mistress" along with "[[The Speech of Polly Baker]]" as two examples that would have convicted one of the nation's leading founding fathers on federal obscenity charges if they had been written and mailed under subsequent law.&lt;ref&gt;Nat Hentoff, ''The Nat Hentoff Reader'', Da Capo Press, 2001, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable of these citations occurred in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''[[United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film]]''.  In a dissenting opinion, Justice [[William O. Douglas]] states:
{{quote|The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was the product of a robust, not a prudish, age...  This was the age when Benjamin Franklin wrote his "Advice to a Young Man on Choosing a Mistress" and "[[Fart Proudly|A Letter to the Royal Academy at Brussels]]".  When the United States became a nation, none of the fathers of the country were any more concerned than Franklin with the question of pornography...  The [[Anthony Comstock]]s, the [[Thomas Bowdler]]s and [[Victorian era|Victorian]] hypocrisy—the predecessors of our present obscenity laws—had yet to come upon the stage.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=413&amp;invol=123 United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film]'', 413 U.S. 123 (1973); accessed 19 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The letter is also referenced during a conversation with Benjamin Franklin in the 2012 [[video game]] ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' during a cutscene in a general store.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JzXG-G3Asg ''Assassin's Creed III'' - Benjamin Franklin's 8 Reasons for Dating Older Women"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Allgemeine encyclopaedie.png|thumb|Title page of volume 1]]
The '''''Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste''''' ("Universal Encyclopaedia of Sciences and Arts") was a 19th-century German [[encyclopaedia]] published by [[Johann Samuel Ersch]] and [[Johann Gottfried Gruber]], therefore also known as the "Ersch-Gruber." One of the most ambitious encyclopaedia projects ever, it remains uncompleted.

It was designed and begun in 1813 by Professor Ersch to satisfy the wants of Germans, only in part supplied by foreign works. It was stopped by [[Befreiungskriege|the Napoleonic Wars]] until 1816, when Professor [[Gottlieb Hufeland]] joined, but he died on November 25, 1817, while the specimen part was at press. The first volume appeared in Leipzig in 1818. The editors of the different sections at various times were some of the best-known men of learning in Germany, including Gruber, [[Moritz Hermann Eduard Meier|M.H.E. Meier]], [[Hermann Brockhaus]], W. Müller and [[Andreas Gottlieb Hoffmann|A.G. Hoffmann]] of Jena. Naturalist [[Eduard Poeppig]] wrote most of the articles on the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Poeppig, Eduard|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; All articles bear the authors' names, and those not ready in time were placed at the end of their letter.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Encyclopaedia|display=Encyclopaedia s.v. ''Allgemeine Encyklopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste''|volume=9|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is divided into three sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collison|first1=Robert|title=Encyclopaedias: Their History throughout the Ages|date=1964|publisher=Hafner Publishing Company|location=New York|pages=179–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# A-G (99 volumes published, complete) : 
# H-N (only the first 43 volumes published, through ''Ligatur'')
# O-Z (only the first 25 volumes published, through ''Phyxios'')

From its beginning through 1830, the ''Encyclopädie'' was published at Leipzig by Johan Friedrich Gleditsch. From 1831 until publication ceased in 1889, the ''Encyclopädie'' was published by Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus, also of Leipzig. Gleditsch published volumes 1 through 21 of the first section; volumes 1 through 7 of the second, but only the first volume of the third section. Brockhaus published the remaining volumes through 1889. By 1889, when the project was abandoned, the ''Encyclopädie'' had reached 167 volumes. The article about Greece alone covered 3,668 pages, spanning eight volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collison|first1=Robert|title=Encyclopaedias: Their History throughout the Ages|date=1964|publisher=Hafner Publishing Company|location=New York|pages=179–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berclair Mansion''' was built in 1936.  It is a 22-room, {{convert|10,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} mansion located in [[Berclair, Texas]] (between Goliad and Beeville, [[Texas]]). It is considered the largest steel strand house in the US, constructed with over 60 tons of concrete and steel.&lt;ref name="Starr2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond Starr|title=Goliad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIeBJ5qKe4oC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=30 August 2011|date=25 November 2009|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-7873-6|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house is owned and operated by the Beeville Art Association.

'''''Bethell v Hildyard''''' 38 Ch.D. 220. [1885 B. 2119.] is an important [[Judgment (law)|legal judgment]] of the [[Chancery Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/1325249   Validity of Foreign marriage], [[Harvard Law Review]] Vol. 25, No. 4, Feb  1912  p374.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter heard before [[James Stirling (judge)|Justice Striling]] concerned succession to property by the child of a marriage contracted by Christopher Bethell, an [[England|English]] man in [[Bechuanaland]] [[South Africa]] with Teepoo, a [[Rolong tribe|Barolong]] woman according to the customs of the Baralong people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniset.ca/naty/css/38ChD220.html   Bethell v Hildyard 38 Ch.D. 220.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[marriage]] was held not to be a valid marriage according to the [[law of England]] because the customs of the Baralong people permitted [[polygamy]]. The child was held not entitled to succeed to her father's property.

The '''CELS ratings''' or '''Camels rating''' is a supervisory rating system originally developed in the U.S. to classify a [[bank condition|bank's overall condition]]. It is applied to every bank and credit union in the U.S. (approximately 8,000 institutions) and is also implemented outside the U.S. by various banking supervisory regulators. 

The ratings are assigned based on a ratio analysis of the financial statements, combined with on-site examinations made by a designated supervisory regulator. In the U.S. these supervisory regulators include the [[Federal Reserve]], the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]], the [[National Credit Union Administration]], the [[Farm Credit Administration]], and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]. 

Ratings are not released to the public but only to the top management to prevent a possible [[bank run]] on an institution which receives a CAMELS rating downgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frbsf.org/econrsrch/wklyltr/wklyltr99/el99-19.html|title=Using CAMELS Ratings to Monitor Bank Conditions|author=|date=|website=FRBSF.org|access-date=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions with deteriorating situations and declining CAMELS ratings are subject to ever increasing supervisory scrutiny. Failed institutions are eventually resolved via a formal resolution process designed to protect retail depositors. 

The components of a bank's condition that are assessed:
*  '''(C)'''[[Capital adequacy|apital adequacy]]
*  '''(A)'''[[Asset quality|ssets]]
*  '''(M)'''[[Management|anagement Capability]]
*  '''(E)'''[[Earnings|arnings]]
*  '''(L)'''[[Asset liability management|iquidity]] (also called asset liability management)
*  '''(S)'''[[Market risk|ensitivity]] (sensitivity to market risk, especially interest rate risk)
Ratings are given from 1 (best) to 5 (worst) in each of the above categories.

In India, for supervision (inspection) of banks an extended framework is used which is named - C A M E L S C where the alphabets C A M E L  stand for what has been mentioned above but, 'S'- means- 'Systems' (like, Management Information System- MIS) and 'C' means- 'Compliance' - to various rules, regulations, Acts. etc. (https://www.nabard.org/content1.aspx?id=523&amp;catid=8&amp;mid=490) 

==Development==
In 1979, the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (UFIRS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (UFIRS)|url=http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/5000-900.html|publisher=FDIC Law, Regulations, Related Acts|access-date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was implemented in U.S. banking institutions, and later globally, following a recommendation by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The system became internationally known with the abbreviation CAMEL, reflecting five assessment areas: capital, asset quality, management, earnings and liquidity. In 1995 the Federal Reserve and the OCC replaced CAMEL with CAMELS, adding the "S" which stands for (S)ensitivity to Market Risk.

==Composite ratings==
The rating system is designed to take into account and reflect all significant financial and operational factors examiners assess in their evaluation of an institutions performance. Institutions are rated using a combination of specific financial ratios and examiner qualitative judgments.

The following describes some details of the CAMEL system in the context of examining a credit union.&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncua.gov/letters/Prior1996/E-LET161.html|title=NCUA Letter to Credit Unions|date=November 2000|publisher=NCUA|access-date=July 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721055244/http://www.ncua.gov/letters/Prior1996/E-LET161.html#|archive-date=July 21, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rating 1===
Indicates strong performance and risk management practices that consistently provide for safe and sound operations. Management clearly identifies all risks and employs compensating factors mitigating concerns. The historical trend and projections for key performance measures are consistently positive. Banks and credit unions in this group resist external economic and financial disturbances and withstand the unexpected actions of business conditions more ably than banks and credit unions with a lower composite rating. Any weaknesses are minor and can be handled in a routine manner by the board of directors and management. These banks and credit unions are in substantial compliance with laws and regulations. Such institutions give no cause for supervisory concern.

===Rating 2===
Reflects satisfactory performance and risk management practices that consistently provide for safe and sound operations. Management identifies most risks and compensates accordingly. Both historical and projected key performance measures should generally be positive with any exceptions being those that do not directly affect safe and sound operations. Banks and credit unions in this group are stable and able to withstand business fluctuations quite well; however, minor areas of weakness may be present which could develop into conditions of greater concern. These weaknesses are well within the board of directors' and management's capabilities and willingness to correct. These banks and credit unions are in substantial compliance with laws and regulations. The supervisory response is limited to the extent that minor adjustments are resolved in the normal course of business and that operations continue to be satisfactory.

===Rating 3===
Represents performance that is flawed to some degree and is of supervisory concern. Risk management practices may be less than satisfactory relative to the bank's or credit union's size, complexity, and risk profile. Management may not identify and provide mitigation of significant risks. Both historical and projected key performance measures may generally be flat or negative to the extent that safe and sound operations may be adversely affected. Banks and credit unions in this group are only nominally resistant to the onset of adverse business conditions and could easily deteriorate if concerted action is not effective in correcting certain identifiable areas of weakness. Overall strength and financial capacity is present so as to make failure only a remote probability. These banks and credit unions may be in significant noncompliance with laws and regulations. Management may lack the ability or willingness to effectively address weaknesses within appropriate time frames. Such banks and credit unions require more than normal supervisory attention to address deficiencies.

===Rating 4===
Refers to poor performance that is of serious supervisory concern. Risk management practices are generally unacceptable relative to the bank's or credit union's size, complexity and risk profile. Key performance measures are likely to be negative. Such performance, if left unchecked, would be expected to lead to conditions that could threaten the viability of the bank or credit union. There may be significant noncompliance with laws and regulations. The board of directors and management are not satisfactorily resolving the weaknesses and problems. A high potential for failure is present but is not yet imminent or pronounced. Banks and credit unions in this group require close supervisory attention.

===Rating 5===
Considered unsatisfactory performance that is critically deficient and in need of immediate remedial attention. Such performance, by itself or in combination with other weaknesses, directly threatens the viability of the bank or credit union. The volume and severity of problems are beyond management's ability or willingness to control or correct. Banks and credit unions in this group have a high probability of failure and will likely require liquidation and the payoff of shareholders, or some other form of emergency assistance, merger, or acquisition.

==Capital adequacy (CA)==
Part 702 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations sets forth the statutory net worth categories, and risk-based net worth requirements for federally insured credit unions. References are made in this Letter to the five net worth categories which are: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized", "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized."

Credit unions that are less than "adequately capitalized" must operate under an approved net worth restoration plan. Examiners evaluate capital adequacy by assessing progress toward goals set forth in the plan.

Determining the adequacy of a credit union's capital begins with a qualitative evaluation of critical variables that directly bear on the institution's overall financial condition. Included in the assessment of capital is the examiners opinion of the strength of the credit union's capital position over the next year or several years based on the credit union's plan and underlying assumptions. Capital is a critical element in the credit union's risk management program. The examiner assesses the degree to which credit, interest rate, liquidity, transaction, compliance, strategic, and reputation risks may impact on the credit union's current and future capital position. The examiner also considers the interrelationships with the other areas:

* Capital level and trend analysis;
* Compliance with risk-based net worth requirements;
* Composition of capital;
* Interest and dividend policies and practices;
* Adequacy of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses account;
* Quality, type, liquidity and diversification of assets, with particular reference to classified assets;
* Loan and investment concentrations;
* Growth plans;
* Volume and risk characteristics of new business initiatives;
* Ability of management to control and monitor risk, including credit and interest rate risk;
* Earnings. Good historical and current earnings performance enables a credit union to fund its growth, remain competitive, and maintain a strong capital position;
* Liquidity and funds management;
* Extent of contingent liabilities and existence of pending litigation;
* Field of membership; and
* Economic environment.

===Ratings===

Credit unions that maintain a level of capital fully commensurate with their current and expected risk profiles and can absorb any present or anticipated losses are accorded a rating of 1 for capital. Such credit unions generally maintain capital levels at least at the statutory net worth requirements to be classified as "well capitalized" and meet their risk-based net worth requirement. Further, there should be no significant asset quality problems, earnings deficiencies, or exposure to credit or interest-rate risk that could negatively affect capital.

A capital adequacy rating of 2 is accorded to a credit union that also maintains a level of capital fully commensurate with its risk profile both now and in the future and can absorb any present or anticipated losses. However, its capital position will not be as strong overall as those of 1 rated credit unions. Also, there should be no significant asset quality problems, earnings deficiencies, or exposure to interest-rate risk that could affect the credit union's ability to maintain capital levels at least at the "adequately capitalized" net worth category. Credit unions in this category should meet their risk-based net worth requirements.

A capital adequacy rating of 3 reflects a level of capital that is at least at the "undercapitalized" net worth category. Such credit unions normally exhibit more than ordinary levels of risk in some significant segments of their operation. There may be asset quality problems, earnings deficiencies, or exposure to credit or interest-rate risk that could affect the credit union's ability to maintain the minimum capital levels. Credit unions in this category may fail to meet their risk-based net worth requirements.

A capital adequacy rating of 4 is appropriate if the credit union is "significantly undercapitalized" but asset quality, earnings, credit or interest-rate problems will not cause the credit union to become critically undercapitalized in the next 12 months. A 4 rating may be appropriate for a credit union that does not have sufficient capital based on its capital level compared with the risks present in its operations.

A 5 rating is given to a credit union if it is critically undercapitalized, or has significant asset quality problems, negative earnings trends, or high credit or interest-rate risk exposure is expected to cause the credit union to become "critically undercapitalized" in the next 12 months. Such credit unions are exposed to levels of risk sufficient to jeopardize their solvency.

==Asset quality==
Asset quality is high loan concentrations that present undue risk to the credit union;
* The appropriateness of investment policies and practices;
* The investment risk factors when compared to capital and earnings structure; and
* The effect of fair (market) value of investments vs. book value of investments.

The asset quality rating is a function of present conditions and the likelihood of future deterioration or improvement based on economic conditions, current practices and trends. The examiner assesses credit union's management of credit risk to determine an appropriate component rating for Asset Quality. Interrelated to the assessment of credit risk, the examiner evaluates the impact of other risks such as interest rate, liquidity, strategic, and compliance.

The quality and trends of all major assets must be considered in the rating. This includes loans, investments, other real estate owned (ORE0s), and any other assets that could adversely impact a credit union's financial condition.

===Ratings===
A rating of 1 reflects high asset quality and minimal portfolio risks. In addition, lending and investment policies and procedures are in writing, conducive to safe and sound operations and are followed. 

A 2 rating denotes high-quality assets although the level and severity of classified assets are greater in a 2 rated institution. Credit unions that are 1 and 2 rated will generally exhibit trends that are stable or positive.

A rating of 3 indicates a significant degree of concern, based on either current or anticipated asset quality problems. Credit unions in this category may have only a moderate level of problem assets. However, these credit unions may be experiencing negative trends, inadequate loan underwriting, poor documentation, higher risk investments, inadequate lending and investment controls and monitoring that indicate a reasonable probability of increasingly higher levels of problem assets and high-risk concentration.

Asset quality ratings of 4 and 5 represent increasingly severe asset quality problems. A rating of 4 indicates a high level of problem assets that will threaten the institution's viability if left uncorrected. A 4 rating should also be assigned to credit unions with moderately severe levels of classified assets combined with other significant problems such as inadequate valuation allowances, high-risk concentration, or poor underwriting, documentation, collection practices, and high-risk investments. Rating 5 indicates that the credit union's viability has deteriorated due to the corrosive effect of its asset problems on its earnings and level of capital.

==Management==
Management is the most forward-looking indicator of condition and a key determinant of whether a credit union possesses the ability to correctly diagnose and respond to financial stress. The management component provides examiners with objective, and not purely subjective, indicators. An assessment of management is not solely dependent on the current financial condition of the credit union and will not be an average of the other component ratings.

Reflected in this component rating is both the board of directors' and management's ability to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks of the credit union's activities, ensure its safe and sound operations, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Management practices should address some or all of the following risks: credit, interest rate, liquidity, transaction, compliance, reputation, strategic, and other risks.

The management rating is based on the following areas, as well as other factors as discussed below.

===Business strategy and financial performance ===
The credit union's strategic plan is a systematic process that defines management's course in assuring that the organization prospers in the next two to three years. The strategic plan incorporates all areas of a credit union's operations and often sets broad goals, e.g., capital accumulation, growth expectations, enabling credit union management to make sound decisions. The strategic plan should identify risks within the organization and outline methods to mitigate concerns.

As part of the strategic planning process, credit unions should develop business plans for the next one or two years. The board of directors should review and approve the business plan, including a budget, in the context of its consistency with the credit union's strategic plan. The business plan is evaluated against the strategic plan to determine if it is consistent with its strategic plan. Examiners also assess how the plan is put into effect. The plans should be unique to and reflective of the individual credit union. The credit union's performance in achieving its plan strongly influences the management rating.

Information systems and technology should be included as an integral part of the credit union's strategic plan. Strategic goals, policies, and procedures addressing the credit union's information systems and technology ("IS&amp;T") should be in place. Examiners assess the credit union's risk analysis, policies, and oversight of this area based on the size and complexity of the credit union and the type and volume of e-Commerce services' offered. Examiners consider the criticality of e-Commerce systems2 and services in their assessment of the overall IS&amp;T plan.

Prompt corrective action may require the development of a net worth restoration plan ("NWRP") in the event the credit union becomes less than adequately capitalized. A NWRP addresses the same basic issues associated with a business plan. The plan should be based on the credit union's asset size, complexity of operations, and field of membership. It should specify the steps the credit union will take to become adequately capitalized. If a NWRP is required, the examiner will review the credit union's progress toward achieving the goals set forth in the plan.

===Internal controls===
An area that plays a crucial role in the control of a credit union's risks is its system of internal controls. Effective internal controls enhance the safeguards against system malfunctions, errors in judgment and fraud. Without proper controls in place, management will not be able to identify and track its exposure to risk. Controls are also essential to enable management to ensure that operating units are acting within the parameters established by the board of directors and senior management.

Seven aspects of internal controls deserve special attention:
# '''Information systems.''' It is crucial that effective controls are in place to ensure the integrity, security, and privacy of information contained on the credit union's computer systems. In addition, the credit union should have a tested contingency plan in place for the possible failure of its computer systems.
# '''Segregation of duties.''' The credit union should have adequate segregation of duties and professional resources in every area of operation. Segregation of duties may be limited by the number of employees in smaller credit unions.
# '''Audit program.''' The effectiveness of the credit union's audit program in determining compliance with policy should be reviewed. An effective audit function and process should be independent, reporting to the Supervisory Committee without conflict or interference with management. An annual audit plan is necessary to ensure that all risk areas are examined, and that those areas of greatest risk receive priority. Reports should be issued to management for comment and action and forwarded to the board of directors with management's response. Follow-up of any unresolved issues is essential, e.g., examination exceptions, and should be covered in subsequent reports. In addition, a verification of members' accounts needs to be performed at least once every two years.
# '''Record keeping.''' The books of every credit union should be kept in accordance with well-established accounting principles. In each instance, a credit union's records and accounts should reflect its actual financial condition and accurate results of operations. Records should be current and provide an audit trail. The audit trail should include sufficient documentation to follow a transaction from its inception through to its completion. Subsidiary records should be kept in balance with general ledger control figures.
# '''Protection of physical assets.''' A principal method of safeguarding assets is to limit access by authorized personnel. Protection of assets can be accomplished by developing operating policies and procedures for cash control, joint custody (dual control), teller operations, and physical security of the computer.
# '''Education of staff.''' Credit union staff should be thoroughly trained in specific daily operations. A training program tailored to meet management needs should be in place and cross-training programs for office staff should be present. Risk is controlled when the credit union is able to maintain continuity of operations and service to members.
# '''Succession planning.''' The ongoing success of any credit union will be greatly impacted by the ability to fill key management positions in the event of resignation or retirement. The existence of a detailed succession plan that provides trained management personnel to step in at a moment's notice is essential to the long-term stability of a credit union. A succession plan should address the Chief Executive Officer (or equivalent) and other senior management positions (manager, assistant manager, etc.).

===Other management issues ===
Other key factors to consider when assessing the management of a credit union include, but are not limited to:
* Adequacy of the policies and procedures covering each area of the credit union's operations (written, board approved, followed);
* Budget performance compared against actual performance;
* Effectiveness of systems that measure and monitor risk;
* Risk-taking practices and methods of control to mitigate concerns;
* Integration of risk management with planning and decision-making;
* Responsiveness to examination and audit suggestions, recommendations, or requirements;
* Compliance with laws and regulations;
* Adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses account and other valuation reserves;
* Appropriateness of the products and services offered in relation to the credit union's size and management experience;
* Loan to share ratio trends and history;
* Market penetration;
* Rate structure; and
* Cost-benefit analysis of major service products.

The board of directors and management have a fiduciary responsibility to the members to maintain very high standards of professional conduct:
# Compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations.  Management should also adhere to all laws and regulations that provide equal opportunity for all members regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap.
# Appropriateness of compensation policies and practices for senior management. Management contracts should not contain provisions that are likely to cause undue hardship on the credit union. The board needs to ensure performance standards are in place for the CEO/Manager and senior management and an effective formal evaluation process is in place and being documented.
# Avoidance of conflict of interest. Appropriate policies and procedures for avoidance of conflicts of interest and management of potential conflicts of interest should be in place.
#  Professional ethics and behavior. Management should not use the credit union for unauthorized or inappropriate personal gain. Credit union property should not be used for anything other than authorized activities. Management should act ethically and impartially in carrying out appropriate credit union policies and procedures.

===Ratings===
A management rating of 1 indicates that management and directors are fully effective. They are responsive to changing economic conditions and other concerns and are able to cope successfully with existing and foreseeable problems that may arise in the conduct of the credit union's operation.

For a management rating of 2, minor deficiencies are noted, but management produces a satisfactory record of performance in light of the institution's particular circumstances.

A 3 rating in management indicates that either operating performance is lacking in some measures, or some other conditions exist such as inadequate strategic planning or inadequate response to NCUA supervision. Management is either characterized by modest talent when above average abilities are needed or is distinctly below average for the type and size of the credit union. Thus, management's responsiveness or ability to correct less than satisfactory conditions is lacking to some degree.

A management rating of 4 indicates that serious deficiencies are noted in management's ability or willingness to meet its responsibilities. Either management is considered generally unable to manage the credit union in a safe and sound manner or conflict-of-interest situations exist that suggest that management is not properly performing its fiduciary responsibilities. In these cases, problems resulting from management weakness are of such severity that management may need to be strengthened or replaced before sound conditions can be achieved.

A management rating of 5 is applicable to those instances where incompetence or self-dealing has been clearly demonstrated. In these cases, problems resulting from management weakness are of such severity that some type of administrative action may need to be initiated, including the replacement of management, in order to restore safe and sound operations.

==Earnings==
The continued viability of a credit union depends on its ability to earn an appropriate return on its assets which enables the institution to fund expansion, remain competitive, and replenish and/or increase capital.

In evaluating and rating earnings, it is not enough to review past and present performance alone. Future performance is of equal or greater value, including performance under various economic conditions. Examiners evaluate "core" earnings: that is the long-run earnings ability of a credit union discounting temporary fluctuations in income and one-time items. A review for the reasonableness of the credit union's budget and underlying assumptions is appropriate for this purpose. Examiners also consider the interrelationships with other risk areas such as credit and interest rate.

Key factors to consider when assessing the credit union's earnings are:
* Level, growth trends, and stability of earnings, particularly return on average assets;
* Adequacy of valuation allowances and their effect on earnings;
* Adequacy of budgeting systems, forecasting processes, and management information systems, in general;
* Future earnings prospects under a variety of economic conditions;
* Net interest margin;
* Net non-operating income and losses and their effect on earnings;
* Quality and composition of assets;
* Net worth level;
* Sufficiency of earnings for necessary capital formation; and
* Material factors affecting the credit union's income producing ability such as fixed assets and other real estate owned ("OREOs").

===Ratings===
Earnings rated 1 are currently, and are projected to be, sufficient to fully provide for loss absorption and capital formation with due consideration to asset quality, growth, and trends in earnings.

An institution with earnings that are positive and relatively stable may receive a 2 rating, provided its level of earnings is adequate in view of asset quality and operating risks. The examiner must consider other factors, such as earnings trends and earnings quality to determine if earnings should be assigned a 2 rating.

A 3 rating should be accorded if current and projected earnings are not fully sufficient to provide for the absorption of losses and the formation of capital to meet and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The earnings of such institutions may be further hindered by inconsistent earnings trends, chronically insufficient earnings or less than satisfactory performance on assets.

Earnings rated 4 may be characterized by erratic fluctuations in net income, the development of a severe downward trend in income, or a substantial drop in earnings from the previous period, and a drop in projected earnings is anticipated. The examiner should consider all other relevant quantitative and qualitative measures to determine if a 4 is the appropriate rating.

Credit unions experiencing consistent losses should be rated 5 in Earnings. Such losses may represent a distinct threat to the credit union's solvency through the erosion of capital. A 5 rating would normally be assigned to credit unions that are unprofitable to the point that capital will be depleted within twelve months.

==Liquidity – asset and liability management==
Asset and liability management (ALM) is the process of evaluating, monitoring, and controlling balance sheet risk (interest rate risk and liquidity risk). A sound ALM process integrates strategic, profitability, and net worth planning with risk management. Examiners review (a) interest rate risk sensitivity and exposure; (b) reliance on short-term, volatile sources of funds, including any undue reliance on borrowings; (c) availability of assets readily convertible into cash; and (d) technical competence relative to ALM, including the management of interest rate risk, cash flow, and liquidity, with a particular emphasis on assuring that the potential for loss in the activities is not excessive relative to its capital. ALM covers both interest rate and liquidity risks and also encompasses strategic and reputation risks.

===Interest rate risk===
Interest-Rate Risk  - the risk of adverse changes to earnings and capital due to changing levels of interest rates. Interest-rate risk is evaluated principally in terms of the sensitivity and exposure of the value of the credit union's investment and loan portfolios to changes in interest rates. In appraising ALM, attention should be directed to the credit union's liability funding costs relative to its yield on assets and its market environment.

When evaluating this component, the examiner considers: management's ability to identify, measure, monitor, and control interest rate risk; the credit union's size; the nature and complexity of its activities; and the adequacy of its capital and earnings in relation to its level of interest rate risk exposure. The examiner also considers the overall adequacy of established policies, the effectiveness of risk optimization strategies, and the interest rate risk methodologies. These policies should outline individual responsibilities, the credit union's risk tolerance, and ensure timely monitoring and reporting to the decision-makers. Examiners determine that the ALM system is commensurate with the complexity of the balance sheet and level of capital.

Key factors to consider in evaluating sensitivity to interest rate risk include:
* Interest-rate risk exposure at the instrument, portfolio, and balance sheet levels;
* Balance sheet structure;
* Liquidity management;
* Qualifications of risk management personnel;
* Quality of oversight by the board and senior management;
* Earnings and capital trend analysis over changing economic climates;
* Prudence of policies and risk limits;
* Business plan, budgets, and projections; and,
* Integration of risk management with planning and decision-making.

===Liquidity risk===
Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to efficiently meet present and future cash flow needs without adversely affecting daily operations. Liquidity is evaluated on the basis of the credit union's ability to meet its present and anticipated cash flow needs, such as, funding loan demand, share withdrawals, and the payment of liabilities and expenses. Liquidity risk also encompasses poor management of excess funds.

The examiner considers the current level of liquidity and prospective sources of liquidity compared to current and projected funding needs. Funding needs include loan demand, share withdrawals, and the payment of liabilities and expenses. Examiners review reliance on short-term, volatile sources of funds, including any undue reliance on borrowings; availability of assets readily convertible into cash; and technical competence relative to liquidity and cash flow management. Examiners also review the impact of excess liquidity on the credit union's net interest margin, which is an indicator of interest rate risk.

The cornerstone of a strong liquidity management system is the identification of the credit union's key risks and a measurement system to assess those risks.

Key factors to consider in evaluating the liquidity management include:
* Balance sheet structure;
* Contingency planning to meet unanticipated events (sources of funds —adequacy of provisions for borrowing, e.g., lines of credit, corporate credit union membership, FHLB agreements);
* Contingency planning to handle periods of excess liquidity;
* Cash flow budgets and projections; and
* Integration of liquidity management with planning and decision-making.

Examiners will consider the overall adequacy of established policies, limits, and the effectiveness of risk optimization strategies when assigning a rating. These policies should outline individual responsibilities, the credit union's risk tolerance, and ensure timely monitoring and reporting to the decision makers.

Examiners determine that the liquidity management system is commensurate with the complexity of the balance sheet and amount of capital. This includes evaluating the mechanisms to monitor and control risk, management's response when risk exposure approaches or exceeds the credit union's risk limits, and corrective action taken, when necessary.

===Overall asset and liability management===
Examiners will have regulatory concern if one or more of the following circumstances exist:
# An overall asset/liability management policy addressing interest rate risk, liquidity, and contingency funding is either nonexistent or inadequate.
# The board has established unacceptable limits on its risk exposure.
# There is noncompliance with the board's policies or limits.
# There are weaknesses in the management measurement, monitoring, and reporting systems.

===Ratings===
A rating of 1 indicates that the credit union exhibits only modest exposure to balance sheet risk. Management has demonstrated it has the necessary controls, procedures, and resources to effectively manage risks. Interest rate risk and liquidity risk management are integrated into the credit union's organization and planning to promote sound decisions. Liquidity needs are met through planned funding and controlled uses of funds. Liquidity contingency plans have been established and are expected to be effective in meeting unanticipated funding needs. The level of earnings and capital provide substantial support for the degree of balance risk taken by the credit union.

A rating of 2 indicates that the credit union's risk exposure is reasonable, management's ability to identify, measure, monitor, control, and report risk is sufficient, and it appears to be able to meet its reasonably anticipated needs. There is only moderate potential that earnings performance or capital position will be adversely affected. Policies, personnel, and planning reflect that risk management is conducted as part of the decision-making process. The level of earnings and capital provide adequate support for the degree of balance sheet risk taken by the credit union.

A rating of 3 indicates that the risk exposure of the credit union is substantial, and management's ability to manage and control risk requires improvement. Liquidity may be insufficient to meet anticipated operational needs, necessitating unplanned borrowing. Improvements are needed to strengthen policies, procedures, or the organization's understanding of balance sheet risks. A rating of 3 may also indicate the credit union is not meeting its self-imposed risk limits or is not taking timely action to bring performance back into compliance. The level of earnings and capital may not adequately support the degree of balance sheet risk taken by the credit union.

Ratings of 4 and 5 indicate that the credit union exhibits an unacceptably high exposure to risk. Management does not demonstrate an acceptable capacity to measure and manage interest-rate risk, or the credit union has an unacceptable liquidity position. Analyses under modeling scenarios indicate that a significant deterioration in performance is very likely for credit unions rated 4 and inevitable for credit unions rated 5. Ratings of 4 or 5 may also indicate levels of liquidity such that the credit union cannot adequately meet demands for funds. Such a credit union should take immediate action to lower its interest-rate exposure, improve its liquidity, or otherwise improve its condition. The level of earnings and capital provide inadequate support for the degree of balance sheet risk taken by the credit union.

A rating of 5 would be appropriate for a credit union with an extreme risk exposure or liquidity position so critical as to constitute an imminent threat to the credit union's continued viability. Risk management practices are wholly inadequate for the size, sophistication, and level of balance sheet risk taken by the credit union.

==Sensitivity – sensitivity to market risk, especially interest rate risk==
Sensitivity to 'market risk', the "S" in CAMELS is a complex and evolving measurement area. It was added in 1995 by Federal Reserve and the OCC primarily to address [[interest rate risk]], the sensitivity of all loans and deposits to relatively abrupt and unexpected shifts in interest rates. In 1995 they were also interested in banks lending to farmers, and the sensitivity of farmers ability to make loan repayments as specific crop prices fluctuate. Unlike classic ratio analysis, which most of CAMELS system was based on, which relies on relatively certain, historical, audited financial statements, this ''forward look'' approach involved examining various hypothetical ''future'' price and rate scenarios and then modelling their effects. The variability in the approach is significant.

In June 1996 a Joint Agency Policy Statement was issued by the OCC, Treasury, Fed and FDIC defining interest rate risk as the exposure of a bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates resulting from the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Agency Policy Statement: Interest Rate Risk|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1996-06-26/pdf/96-16300.pdf|publisher=OCC, Treasury, Fed, FDIC|access-date=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''repricing or maturity mismatch risk''' - differences in the maturity or timing of coupon adjustments of bank assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments 
* '''yield curve risk''' - changes in the slope of the yield curve
* '''basis risk''' - imperfect correlations in the adjustment of rates earned and paid on different instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics (e.g. 3 month Treasury bill versus 3 month LIBOR)
* '''option risk''' - interest rate related options embedded in bank products 

The CAMELS system failed to provide early detection and prevention of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. Informed and motivated by the large bank failures, and the ensuing crisis, in June 2009 the FDIC announced a significantly expanded ''Forward-Looking Supervision'' approach, and provided extensive training to its front line bank examiners. These are the employees of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) who visit the banks, apply the official guidelines to practical situations, make assessments, and assign the CAMELS ratings on behalf of the FDIC. Since FDIC is a limited insurance pool they are highly concerned with any rise in bank failure rates. In the same period various other regulators began official stress testing of large banks, with the results often publicly disclosed. See [[Stress test (financial)]], [[List of bank stress tests]], [[List of systemically important banks]].

''Sensitivity to market risk'' can cover ever increasing territory. What began as an assessment of interest rate and farm commodity price risk exposures has grown exponentially over time. ''Forward-looking Supervision'' and ''sensitivity to market risk'' can include:
* Assessing, monitoring, and management of any credit ''concentrations'', for example lending to specific groups such as:
** established commercial real estate lending, or lending for acquisition, development, and construction 
** agricultural lending
** energy sector lending
** medical lending
** credit card lending
* Exposure to market based price changes, including:
** foreign exchange
** commodities
** equities
** derivatives, including interest rate, credit default and other types of swaps

'''CAMPUS''' ([[acronym]] for ''Computer Aided Material Preselection by Uniform Standards'') is a multilingual [[database]] for the properties of plastics. It is considered worldwide as a leader in regard to the level of [[standardization]] and therefore, ease of comparison, of plastics properties. It also supports diagrams to a large extent. CAMPUS is based on [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards 10350,&lt;ref name="ISO10350"&gt;ISO 10350, "Plastics – Acquisition and presentation of comparable single-point data".&lt;/ref&gt; for single-point value e.g. the [[density]], and 11403,&lt;ref name="ISO11403"&gt;ISO 11403, "Plastics – Acquisition and presentation of comparable multipoint data".&lt;/ref&gt; for diagrams, e.g. the [[Stress–strain curve]].

==History==

===Standardization===
In the 1980s, the European market for thermoplastics compounds was extremely confusing. On one hand, the number of supplied grades went up from 5,000 to 10,000, while on the other hand, more than 2,500 technical specifications were published alone by the German [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] that were dealing with plastics in general.&lt;ref name="Swiss2000"&gt;Swiss Materials 2 (1990) Nr. 3a, S. 74 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the citation of a testing standard alone was not sufficient, to exactly specify a test method let alone the question of sample preparation. Within the same period, personal computers became more widely available and were also used to collect plastics data. Many users, molders and material suppliers did that in parallel and completely independently, some using different scales of measurement. Therefore, the question arose how to compare such data.

[[File:CAMPUS-Specimen.png|miniatur|links|300px|Preferred sample geometry in CAMPUS]]

For all these reasons, a DIN committee (''DIN-Fachnormkreis'') began in 1984 to create a list of preferred test methods for plastics testing (the so-called ''Grundwertekatalog'', "Ground-values-catalog")&lt;ref name="GWK"&gt;Richtlinie zur Erstellung von Formmasse-Normen, Teil 2, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;) which should fulfill the following constrictions:
* definition of sample preparation procedures for a small number of samples shapes;
* selection of meaningful test methods with potential for international standardization.

In the European standardization community, the proposal was further developed under close cooperation with UK, France and West Germany (so-called "Tripartite-Forum") within ISO TC61/SC1/WG4 and finally published in 1990 as ISO documents 10350&lt;ref name="ISO10350" /&gt; and ISO 11403.&lt;ref name="ISO11403" /&gt; In the years after, these two standards were revised several times, most recently in 2008 resp. 2003.

===Software development===
'''The early days'''

At the beginning of 1987, the process was discussed to speed-up the public awareness for the ''Grundwertekatalog'' by developing a unique database format for several raw-material suppliers. This idea was further being discussed within major supply companies of the time, such as [[BASF]], [[Bayer AG|Bayer]], [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] and [[Marl, North Rhine-Westphalia#Economy|Hüls]]. They found more advantages:&lt;ref name="Swiss2000" /&gt;
* fulfill the customer demand for comparable data
* replace variety of brochures and datasheets with one database
* accelerate update process
* simplify material pre-selection for plastics (search function)
* establish a single standard, even for other suppliers.

In March 1987, the first meeting was held between experts from these four companies in order to define the architectural needs for the database development:
* easy access to database: which, at that time this meant a PC application distributed by floppy discs
* easy user interface: self-explaining menus and a consistent helping system regardless of the material supplier
* separate data records: the data maintenance shall remain the responsibility of each supplier
* low cost: at that time this was an argument against a centralized client-server-architecture.
* wide usability: IBM-compatible PCs fulfilled this item best; Multi language support was aspired
* easy updating: new releases could be distributed by floppy discs, about one or two times a year, while brochures could only be printed in longer periods. However, it was already seen that a centralized [[client-server]]-architecture would be even more beneficial in respect to release frequency.

In further meetings, product requirement specifications were created, and a discussion was held about the naming started. It was finally decided to use the acronym "CAMPUS" (Computer Aided Material Preselection by Uniform Standards), whereby ''Preselection'' shall emphasize that for the final choice of material parts testing is essential as well. The programming began and on February 23, 1988, CAMPUS 1.2 was presented in a press conference held during a [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]]-K conference. Thereby it was also announced, that any raw material supplier could purchase a licence, but the customer would get standardized data free of charge. The licence includes a commitment to strongly follow the ''Grundwertekatalog''. It was released by ''Chemie Wirtschaftsförderungs Gesellschaft mbH'' (CWFG).

:''Overview on the version history for the CAMPUS software''

'''Version 2 and 3'''

From the start, CAMPUS had an excellent reputation among experts, which allowed for a quick spread and further development. By autumn 1989, a prototype of version 2 was introduced at the K'89 trade show and delivered by mid-1990. The version had an improved user interface and was extended by further single-point values essential for [[Rheology|rheological]] and thermal-calculation programs. For the first time, functional dependencies of properties could be shown in diagrams, e.g. [[viscosity]]-[[Shear strength|shear]]-diagrams or [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]-[[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]]-diagrams. Due to the limited memory space, a concept was introduced that represented a curve by a couple of [[Spline (mathematics)|spline]] nodes. By August 1990, the system was licensed by 22 European plastic suppliers.&lt;ref name="Kst90"&gt;H. Breuer et al., Sonderdruck aus ''Kunststoffe'' '''80''' (1990) 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The version 3.0 was a completely new development with a modified data structure. It provided much more usability (menus with [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]-control, searching profile, abbreviations, curve superposition, [[PostScript]] printing, preferences storage) by using new hardware features as well as an extended property catalogue following the latest standard revision. The product texts were extended, and the [[units of measurement]] could now be switched between [[International System of Units|SI]] and [[Metrication in the United States|US customary]] units.&lt;ref name="Kst94"&gt;H. Breuer et al., Sonderdruck aus ''Kunststoffe'' '''84''' (1994) 7+8&lt;/ref&gt; This version was also the beginning for the [[globalization]] of CAMPUS, because it was no longer licensed only by European suppliers but also by [[DuPont]] and [[Dow Chemical]] from the USA.

'''Version 4'''

In Asia, particularly in Japan, there appeared a strong demand for CAMPUS data in 1995. However, the widely used [[PC-8000 Series|NEC-DOS]] did not allow for a direct implementation of the software in [[Kanji]] text. Therefore, the overdue development of a [[Microsoft Windows]]-based version was initiated. This was 4.0, which also allowed for the inclusion of processing data for plastics. Since there is no technical standard established for this kind of data, it was kept separately for each grade and translated into each language. The Version 4.1 would also include [[Differential scanning calorimetry|DSC]]-curves and [[Equation of state|PVT]]-data.&lt;ref name="VDI98"&gt;R. Tüllmann et al., 21. VDI-Jahrestagung Spritzgießtechnik (1998), S. 167 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the website http://www.campusplastics.com was established. From that time on, the data could be delivered centrally. Before that, each manufacturer had to do it separately. Apparently, all data was available for download and quicker updates. At about the same time ''MCBase'' was published as [[Proprietary software]]. This special edition allowed for comparisons between databases from different material suppliers, in spreadsheets and diagrams. Moreover, data could be exported towards [[Computer Aided Engineering|CAE]]-applications.&lt;ref name="Kst98"&gt;E. Baur, ''Kunststoffe'' '''88''' (1998), S. 654 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next milestone was in 2001, with the inclusion of data for [[chemical resistance]]. This type of workload was not standardized in its full complexity. Therefore, the members agreed on a list of chemicals, for which they declared the general usability by means of simple symbols like [[smiley]] and stop-sign at {{convert|23|°C|°F}}. This allows for a simple search but does not replace a detailed analysis in specific environments.&lt;ref name="Kst01"&gt;A. Lindner, ''Kunststoffe'' '''91''' (2001) 7, S. 28 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same version the class of [[Thermoplastic elastomer|TPEs]] was included in CAMPUS with their own set of properties. The standards had to be extended first in this manner, see [[#TPE-Properties|below]].&lt;ref name="Plst01"&gt;D. Ayglon et al., ''Plastverarbeiter'' '''51''' (2001), S. 188 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, the online version was extended. In 2001 was the beginning of ''WebView'', a web application that allowed the online display of CAMPUS data. Unlike the offline version, a quicker search was possible which was especially intended for occasional users. However, the web functionality and availability of internet connections were generally limited, which is why both versions co-existed. Both versions did not allow the user to search or compare data of more than one manufacturer, which remained the main purpose for MCBase or Material Data Center.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Version 5'''
[[File:CAMPUS51.png|thumb|right|upright=1.20|Screenshot of CAMPUS 5.1]]
With the publication of Version 5, the user interface was updated and the functionality of the internet further included. WebUpdate allowed for the direct update of the database within the application. However, the database itself was only slowly developed, because a high standard was already achieved. A new feature was the implementation of up to three base polymers and up to two filler or reinforcements for [[polymer blend|blends]]. In version 5.1 this methodology was extended for impact modified and flame retardant grades. Moreover, [[Accelerated aging|heat aging]] data could be included for the first time.&lt;ref name="Kst07"&gt;E. Baur, ''Kunststoffe'' 5/2007, S. 76 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the version 5.2 was published.&lt;ref name="MBase10"&gt;[http://www.m-base.de/main/index.php?id=346&amp;L=0 MBase News] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110719055933/http://www.m-base.de/main/index.php?id=346&amp;L=0# |date=2011-07-19 }} (January 15, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This version included several new properties, e.g. light steadiness, extended media steadiness and emission data, and allowed for their reporting together with existing data according to [[Verband der Automobilindustrie|VDA]] rules 232-201, "Data for Selection of Thermoplastic Materials used in Interior, Exterior and Engine Compartment".

==Grundwertekatalog==
The ''Grundwertekatalog'' contains one part for sample preparation and a second part for processing, mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical and "other" properties. A further group describes the behavior against environmental conditions such as fire, [[water absorption|water]] and [[humidity]].&lt;ref name="CoC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.campusplastics.com/details/coc.html# |title=Contents of CAMPUS |access-date=2010-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806180434/http://www.campusplastics.com/details/coc.html# |archive-date=2010-08-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All properties and samples are standardized in ISO 10350 as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14333">The '''''Chronicle of Monemvasia''''' ({{lang-el|Το χρονικόν της Μονεμβασίας}}; rarely known as the '''''Chronicle of the Peloponnesos'''''&lt;ref&gt;Coined by French [[Byzantine studies|Byzantinist]] [[Paul Lemerle]]. {{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=445}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a medieval text of which four versions, all written in [[medieval Greek]], are extant. The author (or authors) of the account is currently unknown. The ''Chronicle'', specifically the version from the [[Iviron monastery|Iberikon monastery]], narrates the events that depict the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avaro]]-[[South Slavs|Slavic]] conquest and colonization of mainland Greece, covering a period from 587 to 805 AD. Despite its compelling narrative, the ''Chronicle'' is not an actual chronicle.&lt;ref name="Curta67"/&gt; The text represents a compilation of sources involving Avars and Slavs and focuses on the foundation of the metropolitan see of Patras.&lt;ref name="Curta67"/&gt; It is possible that the ''Chronicle'' was actually used in negotiations with the metropolitan of Corinth over the status of the metropolitan of Patras.&lt;ref name="Curta67"/&gt;

==Versions==
The first manuscript of the ''Chronicle'' was published in 1749 by Joseph Pasinus (or Giuseppe Passini) and his colleagues, Rivautella and Berta, at the [[Royal Library of Turin]].&lt;ref name="Versions"&gt;{{harvnb|Charanis|1950|pages=141–142}}; {{harvnb|Setton|1950|p=515}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was reissued in 1884 by [[Spyridon P. Lambros]] along with two other versions, one belonging to the Iberikon monastery and the other belonging to the [[Koutloumousiou monastery]] in [[Mount Athos]].&lt;ref name="Versions"/&gt; Minor corrections were made to all three versions of the ''Chronicle'' by N. A. Bees who republished the texts in 1909.&lt;ref name="Versions"/&gt; Three years later (1912), a fourth version was published by Lambros who discovered another text at the Collegio Greco in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Versions"/&gt;

==Order of the texts==
There is currently no consensus among modern scholars regarding the chronological order of the four ''Chronicle'' manuscripts. Lambros argues that the text discovered at the Iberikon monastery is the earliest version.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charanis|1950|p=142}}; {{harvnb|Setton|1950|p=516}}.&lt;/ref&gt; N. A. Bees, however, disagrees with Lambros and finds the Iberikon manuscript to be a later variant of the Turin and Koutloumousion versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charanis|1950|pages=143, 516}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But despite the lack of consensus, recent studies show the Iberikon text to be a later version of the ''Chronicle'' through its use of the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine dating system]] whereas the Koutloumousion and Turin texts use the older [[Alexandrian calendar|Alexandrian dating system]].&lt;ref name="Curta67"&gt;{{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
The author (or authors) of the ''Chronicle of Monemvasia'' is unknown. One hypothesis by J. Koder states that [[Arethas of Caesarea]] was responsible for compiling the text.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Koder's argument was rejected by I. Dujčev based on the ''Chronicle's'' allusion to Emperor [[Nikephoros II]] (r. 963–969), who lived after Arethas.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; What is ultimately known about the author(s) is his/their ignorance of [[Balkan]] geography outside of the Peloponnese, despite basing his/their depiction of Avar attacks on [[Procopius]]'s description of attacks by the [[Huns]].&lt;ref name="Curta67"/&gt;

==Dates of composition==
Scholars are also divergent in their views regarding the exact composition dates of the four ''Chronicle'' manuscripts. [[Paul Lemerle]] argues that the original text was first written in 932 AD when it was used in the Scholion of Arethas.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; However, Spyridon Lambros believes that the Iberikon text was composed between 806 and 1083, whereas the Turin and Koutloumousion texts were written sometime during the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charanis|1950|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; N. A. Bees disputes Lambros’s assessment and believes the entire ''Chronicle'' was developed between 1340 and the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charanis|1950|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; S. Kougeas dates the composition of the text to after the reign of Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] (r. 963–969)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charanis|1950|pages=143–144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Michael Whitby states that the ''Chronicle'' was first composed in the Peloponnese in circa 1000&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitby|1988|p=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; I. Dujčev dates the ''Chronicle'' to 963–1018&amp;nbsp;AD,&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; and Florin Curta dates the writing of the text to either the late 10th century or the early 11th century.&lt;ref name="Curta67"/&gt;

==Narrative==
According to the Iberikon manuscript of the ''Chronicle'', the Avars/Slavs conquered [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus]], [[Attica]], and the island of [[Euboea]].&lt;ref name="Charanis147-148"&gt;{{harvnb|Charanis|1950|pages=147–148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many Greeks retreated to other areas: the inhabitants of [[Patras]] fled to [[Reggio Calabria|Rhegium]] in [[Calabria]], the [[Argos|Argives]] fled to the island of Orobe, the [[Corinth]]ians fled to [[Aegina]], and the [[Laconia]]ns fled to [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name="Geanakoplos274-275"&gt;{{harvnb|Geanakoplos|1984|pages=274–275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Monemvasia]], specifically, was built at the time on the coast in an inaccessible region of the Peloponnese by groups that would later be known collectively as [[Tsakonians|Tzakones]].&lt;ref name="Geanakoplos274-275"/&gt; Due to the more rugged terrain of the eastern Peloponnese, the areas from Corinth to [[Cape Malea]] remained under "Roman" ([[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]]) control.&lt;ref name="Charanis147-148"/&gt; One of the governors of the Peloponnese, a native of [[Lesser Armenia]], came into conflict with a number of Slavic tribes and successfully annihilated them.&lt;ref name="Charanis147-148"/&gt; This unnamed member of the [[Skleros|Skleroi]] family helped make way for the native Greeks to reclaim their lands.&lt;ref name="Charanis147-148"/&gt; Upon hearing these events, Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (r. 802–811) contributed towards revitalizing the cities, rebuilding the churches, and Christianizing the barbarians.&lt;ref name="Charanis147-148"/&gt;

==Derivative works==
Most of the narrative in the ''Chronicle'' is derived from works by [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], [[Theophanes the Confessor]], [[Menander Protector]], and [[Theophylactus Simocatta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1950|p=517}}; {{harvnb|Curta|2001|page=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The author(s) of the ''Chronicle'', however, used another source in order to write about the Avars and Slavs establishing their rule in the Peloponnese for 218&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Setton517"/&gt; This unknown text may have been a forgery of ecclesiastical origin used by or on behalf of the [[Bishop of Patras]].&lt;ref name="Setton517"/&gt; Despite the source being unknown, it was used in both the Scholium of Arethas and in a letter by Patriarch [[Nicholas III of Constantinople|Nicholas III]] to Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (r. 1081–1118).&lt;ref name="Setton517"/&gt;

==Reliability==
The historical validity of the ''Chronicle of Monemvasia'' is still a subject of academic dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|page=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Charanis]], for example, describes the ''Chronicle'' as "absolutely trustworthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charanis|1950|p=163}}; {{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Setton]], however, disagrees with Charanis and argues that the ''Chronicle'' is a "medley of some fact and some fiction".&lt;ref name="Setton517"&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1950|p=517}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stilpon Kyriakides finds that the ''Chronicle'' contains an ecclesiastical bias and that the conquest of Greece by the Avars/Slavs is a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyriakides|1947|pages=93–97}}; {{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=445}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exaggerations and errors===
There are a number of errors and exaggerations in the ''Chronicle of Monemvasia''. For example, the city of Monemvasia was not built after the barbarians invaded Greece. In actuality, the city was constructed approximately four to five years (circa 582–583) before the advent of the Avars and Slavs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|1990|loc=p. 44, Footnote #10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example entails the Corinthians' migration to the island of Aegina in the [[Saronic Gulf]], which is contradicted by a correspondence (February 591&amp;nbsp;AD) between Pope [[Gregory the Great]] and Archbishop Anastasius of Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitby|1988|p=125}}; {{harvnb|Martyn|2004|loc=Refer to Book 1, Section 26 (pp. 148–149)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources that contradict the ''Chronicle'' include canons from the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|Sixth Ecumenical Synod]] (691–692) held in the Trullian Hall of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]], as well as the ''Taktika'' composed by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] (r. 717–741) between 733–746; both sources mention a continued presence of Greeks and church administrative institutions throughout mainland Greece with no indication of long-term Slavic demographic/political overlordship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Constantelos|1970|pp=23–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the rebuilding of churches in the Peloponnese, there is no substantial architectural record that corroborates this particular event mentioned in the ''Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruggieri|1991|p=254}}: "It should be remembered that the Chronicle of Monemvasia mentions the rebuilding of churches in the Peloponnese area under Nicephorus. Despite this evidence, there is no substantial architectural record of rebuilding."&lt;/ref&gt; 

From an archaeological viewpoint, the ''Chronicle of Monemvasia'' overstates the impact of the Avaro-Slavic invasions of Greece.&lt;ref name="MPF"&gt;{{harvnb|Mee|Patrick|Forbes|1997|pages=90–91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Methana]], there is no evidence of any widespread disruption of settlement patterns (this is also the case elsewhere in the Peloponnese).&lt;ref name="MPF"/&gt; The island of [[Kythera]], on the other hand, was abandoned along with other coastal sites due to attacks conducted by one or more Slavic fleets.&lt;ref name="MPF"/&gt;

'''Château de Malmaison''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɑ.to də‿mal.mɛzɔ̃}}) is a French [[château]] near the western bank of the [[Seine]] about {{convert|15|km|mi}} west of the centre of Paris in [[Rueil-Malmaison]].

Formerly the residence of Empress [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], along with the [[Tuileries]] it was the headquarters of the French government from 1800 to 1802, and [[Napoleon]]'s last residence in France at the end of the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the estate became a summer residence of [[Edward Tuck]], the [[U.S. Ambassador to France|Vice Consul]] of the [[Embassy of the United States, Paris|American Legation in Paris]].

[[File:Joséphine-Napoléon.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Napoleon ]]''  and [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] ]]

[[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] bought the manor house in April 1799 for herself and her husband, General Napoléon Bonaparte, the future [[Napoléon I of France]], at that time away fighting the [[Egyptian Campaign]]. Malmaison was a run-down estate, seven miles (12&amp;nbsp;km) west of central Paris that encompassed nearly {{convert|150|acre|km2}} of woods and meadows.

Upon his return, Bonaparte expressed fury at Joséphine for purchasing such an expensive house with the money she had expected him to bring back from the Egyptian campaign. The house, for which she had paid well over 300,000 francs, needed extensive renovations, and she spent a fortune doing so. Malmaison would bring great happiness to the Bonapartes. Joséphine's daughter, [[Hortense de Beauharnais|Hortense]] would call it "a delicious spot".

Joséphine endeavored to transform the large estate into "the most beautiful and curious garden in Europe, a model of good cultivation". She located rare and exotic plants and animals to enhance the gardens. Joséphine wrote: "I wish that Malmaison may soon become the source of riches for all [of France]"... 

In 1800, Joséphine built a heated [[orangery]] large enough for 300 [[pineapple]] plants. Five years later, she ordered the building of a [[greenhouse]], heated by a dozen coal-burning stoves. From 1803 until her death in 1814, Josephine cultivated nearly 200 new plants in France for the first time.

The property achieved enduring fame for its [[rose garden]]. Empress Joséphine had the Belgian artist [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]] (1759–1840) record her [[rose]]s (and [[lilies]]), and prints of these works sell quite well, even today. She created an extensive collection of roses, gathering plants from her native [[Martinique]] and from other places around the world. She grew some 250 varieties of roses. From the foreword to ''Jardin de la Malmaison'' (1803):

:''You have gathered around you the rarest plants growing on French soil...as we inspect them in the beautiful gardens of Malmaison, an impressive reminder of the conquests of your illustrious husband...''

Birds and animals of all sorts began to enrich her garden, where they were allowed to roam free among the grounds. At the height of her days at Malmaison, Joséphine had the company of [[kangaroos]], [[emu]]s, [[black swans]], [[zebras]], sheep, [[gazelles]], [[ostriches]], [[chamois]], a [[Pinniped|seal]], [[antelopes]] and [[llama]]s to name a few. Some were from the [[Baudin expedition to Australia|Baudin expedition]].

After her divorce from Napoléon, Joséphine received Malmaison in her own right, along with a pension of 5&amp;nbsp;million francs a year, and remained there until her death in 1814. Napoléon returned and took residence in the house after his defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815), before his exile to the island of [[Saint Helena]].

In 1842 Malmaison was purchased by [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Maria Christina]], widow of King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]]; she lived there with her second husband [[Agustín Fernando Muñoz, 1st Duke of Riánsares]]. In 1861 Maria Christina sold the property to [[Napoleon III]].

Malmaison was fully restored by the famous French architect [[Pierre Humbert (architect)|Pierre Humbert]] in the early 20th century. It is now considered an important historical monument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=PA00088170 Chateau de Malmaison in the Base Mérimée]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present times==
The public can visit the manor house as a Napoleonic ''musée national''. The museum lies on RN 13 (''route nationale'' 13) from Paris and bus 258 from [[RER A]] "[[Grande Arche]]" station.

A '''douche''' is a device used to introduce a stream of water into the body for medical or hygienic reasons, or the stream of water itself. Douche usually refers to vaginal irrigation, the rinsing of the [[vagina]], but it can also refer to the rinsing of any body cavity. A douche bag is a piece of equipment for douching—a bag for holding the fluid used in douching.

== Etymology ==

The word's first known use is in 1766. ''[[wikt:douche#French|Douche]]'' came into English via [[French language|French]], from {{lang-it|doccia}} "conduit pipe" and ''docciare'' "pour by drops" to douche, from ''doccia'' water pipe, probably back-formation from ''doccione'' conduit, from {{lang-lat|duction-}}, ''ductio'' means of conveying water, from ''ducere'' to lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/douche |title=Douche – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|source does not support 'shower'|date=February 2016}} In French today it means ''[[shower]]'', as it does in many non-English European languages.

== Overview ==
[[File:Vaginal douche apparatus.jpg|left|225px|thumb|Vaginal douche apparatus with five quart tank from 1905 nursing text]]

Vaginal douches may consist of water, water mixed with [[vinegar]], or even [[antiseptic]] chemicals. Douching has been touted as having a number of supposed but unproven benefits. In addition to promising to clean the vagina of unwanted odors, it can also be used by women who wish to avoid smearing a sexual partner's penis with menstrual blood while having [[sexual intercourse during menstruation]]. In the past, douching was also used after intercourse as a method of [[birth control]], though it is not effective (see below).

Many health-care professionals state that douching is dangerous, as it interferes with both the vagina's normal self-cleaning and with the natural bacterial culture of the vagina, and it might spread or introduce infections. Douching is implicated in a wide variety of dangers, including: adverse pregnancy outcomes including [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[low birth weight]], preterm labor, [[preterm birth]], and [[chorioamnionitis]]; serious gynecologic outcomes, including increased risk of [[cervical cancer]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], [[endometritis]], and increased risk for [[sexually transmitted infections]], including [[HIV]]; it also predisposes women to develop [[bacterial vaginosis]] (BV),&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/01/microbial_balance_in_vagina_miscarriage_infertility_pre_term_birth_linked.html | title = What's in Your Vagina? A healthy microbiome, hopefully. | first = Moises | last = Velasquez-Manoff | date = Jan 11, 2013 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is further associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name="Cottrell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = B. H. | title = An Updated Review of Evidence to Discourage Douching | journal = MCN, the American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–107; quiz 107–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20215951 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/NMC.0b013e3181cae9da }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] strongly discourages douching, citing the risks of irritation, bacterial vaginosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Frequent douching with water may result in an imbalance of the [[pH]] of the vagina, and thus may put women at risk for possible vaginal infections, especially yeast infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.webmd.com/tc/Vaginal-Problems-Home-Treatment |title=WebMD article on the causes of yeast infections, including douching |publisher=Women.webmd.com |date=2011-10-31 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2003, a randomized, controlled, multi-center study was conducted with 1827 women ages 18–44 who were regular users of a douche product and who had been treated recently for a sexually transmitted bacterial infection or bacterial vaginosis. Women were randomly assigned to use either a newly designed and marketed douche product or a soft cloth towelette. There was little or no indication of a greater risk of PID among women assigned to use the douche product (versus soft cloth towelette).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rothman KJ, Funch DP, Alfredson T, Brady J, Dreyer NA|title=Randomized field trial of vaginal douching, pelvic inflammatory disease and pregnancy|journal=Epidemiology |volume=14|issue=3|pages=340–8|date=May 2003|pmid=12859036|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1044-3983&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=340|doi=10.1097/00001648-200305000-00015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Combination enema and douche syringe.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The "fountain syringe" is used for douching, by replacing the attached [[enema]] nozzle with the vaginal nozzle (shown bottom left). The vaginal nozzle is longer and thicker and has lateral holes]]

Antiseptics used during douching disturb the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina and can cause infections.&lt;ref name=sciencenews&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seppa |first=N. |title=Douching associated with pregnancy risk |journal=Science News |date=2 January 1999 |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=7 |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/pdfs/data/1999/15501/15501-12.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926103430/http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/pdfs/data/1999/15501/15501-12.pdf | archivedate=September 26, 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2013 |doi=10.2307/4011204|jstor=4011204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unclean douching equipment may introduce foreign bodies into the vagina. Douching may also wash bacteria into the [[uterus]] and [[Fallopian tube]]s, causing fertility problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.ivillage.com/gynoperiod/prhygiene/0,,4r3b,00.html|title=Warning from Kelly Shanahan, MD on douching|date=|publisher=Health.ivillage.com|accessdate=2013-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, the practice of douching is now strongly discouraged except when ordered by a physician for medical reasons.&lt;ref name="sciencenews"/&gt;

Douching after intercourse is estimated to reduce the chances of conception by only 15–25%.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} In comparison, proper [[condom]] use reduces the chance of conception by as much as 97%. In some cases douching may force the [[ejaculate]] further into the vagina, increasing the chance of pregnancy. A review of studies by researchers at the [[University of Rochester Medical Center]] (N.Y.) showed that women who douched regularly and later became pregnant had higher rates of [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[infection]]s, and low birth weight infants than women who only douched occasionally or who never douched.&lt;ref name="sciencenews"/&gt;

A 1995 survey quoted in the [[University of Rochester]] study found that 27% of U.S. women age 15 to 44 douched regularly, but that douching was more common among African-American women (over 50%) than among white women (21%),&lt;ref name="sciencenews"/&gt; and frequent douching contributes to more frequent bacterial vaginosis among African-American women than the average.&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;

Medical doctor [[Harriet Hall]] writes that not only can douching change the pH of the vagina and lead to infections, "There is no need ... to cleanse the vagina. It cleanses itself".&lt;ref name="Care and Feeding"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Harriet|authorlink=Harriet Hall |title=The Care and Feeding of the Vagina |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=28–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecodefense-second-edition.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1987 second edition.]]

'''''Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching''''' is a book edited by [[Dave Foreman]], with a foreword by [[Edward Abbey]].

== Background ==

Ned Ludd Books published the first two editions, with Abbzug Press publishing a third edition. The book was first published in 1985.

Much of the inspiration for the book, as well as the term "[[Sabotage#As environmental action|monkeywrenching]]", came from Edward Abbey's 1975 novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]''. Other inspiration for the book likely came from the 1972 book ''[[Ecotage!]]'', which was published by the group [[Environmental Action]] and was in turn inspired by the actions of an activist in the [[Chicago, Illinois]] area who called himself "[[James F. Phillips|The Fox]]", and engaged in such [[vigilante]] actions to protect the environment as plugging smokestacks. The Fox named after the [[Fox River (Little Wabash tributary)|Fox River]] northwest of Chicago was an avid historical boater whom educated and demonstrated Native American and early trapper fishing and boating techniques. The Fox was radicalized to be a founder mentor of the Earth Liberation Front movement&lt;ref&gt;Burning Rage of a Dying Planet. by Craig Rosebraugh. Lantern Books, New York. pg20&lt;/ref&gt; after witnessing toxic dumping into the Fox River over decades which polluted the river to near-death. The Fox became infamous after dumping a bucket of said toxic waste upon the desk of a [[Stone Container Corporation]] executive in Chicago. The Fox was rumored also to plug drainage pipes from toxic industrial plants from his canoe along the Fox River.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/481.html&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the actual content for ''Ecodefense'' came from the "Dear Ned Ludd" column in the newsletter of the group [[Earth First!]] during the 1980s.

[[Monkeywrenching]] is a form of ecodefense. So are [[temporary restraining order]]s and [[tree sitting]], as well as non-violent [[blockade]] and [[civil disobedience]].

Other forms include [[tree spiking]], and billboarding. These are more controversial because they involve destruction, vandalism, and/or the potential for injury.

“Tentatively called ''Ecodefense: A Handbook on the Militant Defense of the Earth'', the publication was to be a radical environmental version of [[William Powell]]'s ''[[Anarchist Cookbook]]''. In its final form, brought out by Foreman's own [[Ned Ludd]] Books (named after the nineteenth-century British worker who destroyed labor-saving machinery), ''Ecodefense: A Field Guide To Monkeywrenching'' gave practical, detailed instructions on how to decommission bulldozers, pull out [[survey stakes]], spike trees, and generally harass and delay resource industry plans. It was an immediate success, and its popularity led [[Oregon]]'s [[Willamette National Forest]] supervisor [[Michael Kerrick]] to denounce the book in a white paper presented at a congressional hearing, in which he threatened to 'close the entire [national forest logging] area to unauthorized entry' if the activities described in the book took place.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kerrick, "Ecotage From Our Perspective" (http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Publications/region/6/willamette/chap6.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; Kerrick soon thereafter introduced the controversial policy of closing national forests to the public whenever environmental protests were expected.

This book was 'banned' in Australia, gazetted in 1992 as 'refused classification' and a prohibited import .&lt;ref&gt;https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/25930365&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''enemy of the people''' is a designation for the political or [[Social class|class]] opponents of the subgroup in power within a larger group. The term implies that by opposing the ruling subgroup, the "enemies" in question are acting against the larger group, for example against society as a whole. It is similar to the notion of "[[enemy of the state]]". The term originated in [[Roman empire|Roman]] times as {{lang-lat|hostis publicus}}, typically translated into English as the "[[public enemy]]". The term in its "enemy of the people" form has been used for centuries in literature (see ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'', the play by [[Henrik Ibsen]], 1882; or ''[[Coriolanus]]'', the play by [[William Shakespeare]], c. 1605). Currently this form is mostly used as a reference to [[Soviet phraseology]].&lt;ref&gt;. [[Benedikt Sarnov|Sarnov, Benedikt]] (2002) ''Our Soviet Newspeak: A Short Encyclopedia of Real Socialism.'', Moscow. {{ISBN|5-85646-059-6}} (Наш советский новояз. Маленькая энциклопедия реального социализма)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the expression==
The expression dates back to [[Imperial Rome|Roman times]].&lt;ref&gt;see also Jal, Paul (1963) [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rea_0035-2004_1963_num_65_1_3689 ''Hostis (publicus) dans la littérature latine de la fin de la République], footnotes 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] declared emperor [[Nero]] a ''hostis publicus'' in AD 68.&lt;ref&gt;Garzetti, Albino (2014) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bk3XAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT220 ''From Tiberius to the Antonines: A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192''], Routledge. p.220 {{ISBN|9781317698432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "''[[:fr:Ennemi du peuple|ennemi du peuple]]''" were extensively used during the [[French revolution]]. On 25 December 1793 [[Robespierre]] stated: "The revolutionary government owes to the good citizen all the protection of the nation; it owes nothing to the Enemies of the People but death".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robespierre]][https://books.google.com/books?id=ik2jUBnhZbgC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA39 "Le but du gouvernement constitutionnel est de conserver la République ; celui du gouvernement révolutionnaire est de la fonder. &amp;#91;…&amp;#93; Le gouvernement révolutionnaire doit au bon citoyen toute la protection nationale ; il ne doit aux Ennemis du Peuple que la mort" (speech at the [[National Convention]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Law of 22 Prairial]] in 1794 extended the remit of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] to punish "enemies of the people", with some political crimes punishable by death, including "spreading false news to divide or trouble the people".&lt;ref name=higgins&gt;Higgins, Andrew (February 26, 2017) [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/world/europe/trump-enemy-of-the-people-stalin.html "Trump Embraces ‘Enemy of the People,’ a Phrase With a Fraught History"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist–Leninist states==

===Soviet Union===
The [[Soviet Union]] made extensive use of the term ({{lang-ru|враг народа}}, ''vrag naroda''), as it fit well with the idea that the people were in control. The term was used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] after coming to power, as early as in the decree of 28 November 1917:
{{quote|all leaders of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]], a party filled with enemies of the people, are hereby to be considered outlaws, and are to be arrested immediately and brought before the revolutionary court.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Werth, Nicolas; Bartošek, Karel; Panné, Jean-Louis; Margolin, Jean-Louis; Paczkowski, Andrzej; and [[Stéphane Courtois|Courtois, Stéphane]] (1999) ''The [[Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other similar terms were in use as well:
*''enemy of the labourers'' (враг трудящихся, ''vrag trudyashchikhsya'')
*''enemy of the proletariat'' (враг пролетариата, ''vrag proletariata'')
*''class enemy'' (классовый враг, ''klassovyi vrag''), etc.

In particular, the term "enemy of the workers" was formalized in the [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/uk58-e.html#58-1a "Article 58"], an online excerpt&lt;/ref&gt; and similar articles in the codes of the other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]].

At various times these terms were applied, in particular, to [[Tsar Nicholas II]] and the Imperial family, [[aristocracy|aristocrat]]s, the [[bourgeoisie]], [[cleric]]s, [[Robber baron (industrialist)|business entrepreneurs]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[kulak]]s, [[monarchism|monarchists]], [[Mensheviks]], [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Esers]], [[General Jewish Labor Union|Bundists]], [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]]ists, the "[[old Bolshevik]]s", the army and police, [[emigrant]]s, [[sabotage|saboteurs]], [[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wreckers]] (вредители, "vrediteli"), "[[parasitism (social offense)|social parasites]]" (тунеядцы, "tuneyadtsy"), ''Kavezhedists'' (people who administered and serviced the [[Chinese Eastern Railway|KVZhD]] (China Far East Railway), particularly the Russian population of [[Harbin]], [[China]]), those considered [[bourgeois nationalism|bourgeois nationalists]] (notably [[Russian nationalism|Russian]], [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], [[Armenian nationalism|Armenian]], [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]], [[Latvians|Latvian]], [[Estonians|Estonian]] nationalists, [[Zionism|Zionists]], [[Basmachi]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=article&amp;ArticleID=1929rysakov1&amp;SubjectID=1929sovietization&amp;Year=1929 "Seventeen Moments in Soviet History"]&lt;/ref&gt;

An "enemy of the people" could be imprisoned, expelled or executed, and lose their property to confiscation. Close relatives of enemies of the people were labeled as "[[Order about Family Members of Traitors of the Motherland|traitor of Motherland family members]]" and prosecuted. They could be sent to [[Gulag]], punished by the [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]] in unpopulated areas, or [[Lishenets|stripped of citizen's rights]]. Being a friend of an ''enemy of the people'' automatically placed the person under suspicion.

A significant fraction of the ''enemies of the people'' were given this label not because of their hostile actions against the ''workers' and peasants' state'', but simply because of their social origin or profession before the revolution: those who used hired labor, high-ranking clergy, former policemen, merchants, etc. Some of them were commonly known as ''[[lishenets|lishentsy]]'' (лишенцы, derived from Russian word ''лишение'', deprivation), because by the [[Soviet Constitution]] they were deprived of the right of [[voting]]. This automatically translated into a deprivation of various social benefits; some of them, e.g., [[rationing]], were at times critical for survival.

Since 1927, Article 20 of the Common Part of the penal code that listed possible "measures of [[social defence]]" had the following item 20a: "declaration to be an enemy of the workers with deprivation of the union republic citizenship and hence of the USSR citizenship, with obligatory expulsion from its territory". Nevertheless, most "enemies of the people" suffered labor camps, rather than expulsion.

In his 1956 speech denouncing Stalin’s cult of personality, Stalin's successor [[Nikita Khrushchev]] called for an end to the use of the term, stating "the formula 'enemy of the people' was specifically introduced for the purpose of physically annihilating such individuals" who disagreed with Stalin.&lt;ref name=higgins /&gt; For decades afterwards, "It was so omnipresent, freighted and devastating in its use under Stalin that nobody [in Russia] wanted to touch it. ... except in reference to history and in jokes", according to an author of a biography of Khrushchev, William Taubman.&lt;ref name=higgins /&gt;

The term returned to Russian public discourse in the late 2000s with a number of nationalist and pro-government politicians (most notably [[Ramzan Kadyrov]]) calling for restoration of the Soviet approach to the "enemies of the people" defined as all [[non-system opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff| url=http://www.pravda.info/society/5632.html | title=Опубликован шорт-лист претендентов на звание "враг народа в левом движении" | date=2006 | accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff| url=http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2016/01/13/n_8111345.shtml | title=Кадыров призвал относиться к внесистемной оппозиции как к врагам народа | date=2015 | accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff| url=http://www.znak.com/urfo/news/06-12-14-44/1032579.html | title=На площадке путинского "Народного фронта" предложили вернуть в употребление статус "враг народа" | date=2014 | accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In [[Mao Zedong]]'s 1957 speech ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'', he comments that "At the present stage, the period of building socialism, the classes, strata and social groups which favour, support and work for the cause of socialist construction all come within the category of the people, while the social forces and groups which resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to or sabotage socialist construction are all ''enemies of the people''."&lt;ref&gt;Mao Zedong (February 27, 1957) [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch04.htm ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'' pp.2–3]&lt;/ref&gt; (According to [[Philip Short]], an author of biographies of Mao and Cambodia's [[Khmer Rouge]] leader [[Pol Pot]], in domestic political struggles Chinese and Cambodian communists rarely if ever used the phrase "enemy of the people" as they were very nationalistic, and saw it as an alien import.)&lt;ref name=higgins /&gt;

Regarding [[Madagascar Plan|the Nazi plan to relocate all Jews to Madagascar]], the Nazi tabloid ''[[Der Stürmer]]'' wrote that "The Jews don't want to go to Madagascar – They cannot bear the climate. Jews are pests and disseminators of diseases. In whatever country they settle and spread themselves out, they produce the same effects as are produced in the human body by germs. ... In former times sane people and sane leaders of the peoples made short shrift of ''enemies of the people''. They had them either expelled or killed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Germ|url=https://www.phdn.org/archives/www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/antisem14.htm|newspaper=[[Der Stürmer]]|issue=38|date=September 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This came several days after more than 350 media organizations editorialized in opposition to Trump's frequent attacks on the press. The resolution, which "Reaffirm[ed] the vital and indispensable role the free press serves," was seen as a symbolic rebuke to Trump. It passed by unanimous vocal assent, in which the votes of individual Senators are not recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, Jaclyn (August 16, 2018) [https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2018/08/16/senate-unanimously-passes-resolution-affirming-press-not-enemy-people/6XfWvGTMqvzJVfJSIa0HDK/story.html "US Senate unanimously passes resolution affirming the press ‘is not the enemy of the people’"] ''[[The Boston Globe]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15099">In film, English-language [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s can be part of acting performances.  Actors use [[dialect coach]]es to speak in an accent other than their own. Accents can vary by locality, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and other factors. In film, accents are scrutinized by film critics and film audiences alike. Throughout film history, certain actors are known for their accents, and certain accents in individual films have been judged as exceptionally good or bad.

=={{anchor|Accent coaching|Dialect coaching}} Dialect coaching==

In the 1990s, [[dialect coach]]es became significant in the film industry as more filmmakers began employing them to train actors to speak in accents. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the general training approach, "It's a process that involves repetition, studying audio- and videotapes, visits to locations where the characters live, along with breathing and vocal exercises." Coaches start "by breaking down the script phonetically" using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], and since most actors are not familiar with the alphabet, the coaches use other approaches to train actors, such as word lists or tapes. Coaches often have archives of sample tapes to reference in their work. They are usually brought in during rehearsals, the post-production process, or emotional scenes that challenge an accepted performance. In the credits, they are usually listed as dialogue consultants.&lt;ref name="baskin" /&gt;

==American accents==

American accents became increasingly adopted by non-American actors by 2000. With many film-related opportunities available in the United States, actors trained to have American accents to be more competitive. At the [[72nd Academy Awards]] honoring [[1999 in film|films of 1999]], all non-American actors nominated in the four acting categories portrayed American characters, including British actor [[Michael Caine]], who won [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his role in ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]''. Another attribution to the trend is with films increasingly being co-financed by non-U.S. interests, film producers became more willing to cast non-American actors.&lt;ref name="baskin" /&gt;

While actors in [[theatre]] are traditionally trained to have a "[[Mid-Atlantic accent|Standard American]]" accent, actors in film are instead trained to have a [[General American]] accent. Dialect coach [[Robert Easton (actor)|Robert Easton]] said the Standard American accent was "too semi-British" and opted for General American. Easton commended British actors in learning American accents, "[They] in general are very open to doing whatever is necessary to create the character, not only in terms of dialect, but in terms of body language, mannerisms and so forth. It's an oversimplification, but the English tend to try and use themselves to find and express the character, whereas Americans are more likely to use the character to express themselves."&lt;ref name="baskin" /&gt;

===Welsh===

{{main|Welsh English}}

Because of the [[Welsh language]]'s musical quality, the Welsh English accent is difficult for non-Welsh actors to master. The language has Celtic roots like [[Irish Gaelic]] but is more arcane. Dialect coach Penny Dyer said, "The Welsh language has the loosest intonation system in the whole of the British Isles." The accent is more difficult than Irish and Scottish. For ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'' (1941), set in Wales but filmed in California, director [[John Ford]] avoided depicting the Welsh accent by casting British and Irish actors who spoke with Irish accents. For the British film ''[[The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain]]'' (1995), director [[Christopher Monger]] sought to capture the accent onscreen by having actors [[Colm Meaney]], [[Tara FitzGerald]], and [[Ian Hart]] trained to sound like denizens of [[South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Lyall  | first=Sarah | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/movies/film-the-hardest-part-making-the-actors-sound-welsh.html | title=The Hardest Part: Making the Actors Sound Welsh | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 28, 1995 | accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, when Welsh-born actor [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] encouraged Welsh singer-songwriter [[Charlotte Church]] to hide her native accent in pursuit of an acting career, Welsh film critic Gary Slaymaker and the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] both decried the need for the disguise. RADA's Dominic Kelly said, "We get a couple of Welsh accents through here every year, and there's now an increasing amount of demand for them. A few years ago it was Scottish, but now Welsh is very much in vogue. As long as people can understand what you are saying, the Welsh accent is a bonus. Voices need character and individuality." Slaymaker said, "It's unlikely they'll be able to tell the difference between a Welsh or Irish accent. It'll just be seen as colourful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/zeta-tells-charlotte-change-your-2367158 | title=Zeta tells Charlotte 'change your accent' | work=[[WalesOnline]] | date=November 10, 2005 | accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 film ''[[The Last Sin Eater (film)|The Last Sin Eater]]'', produced in the United States, depicted a Welsh American community living in the [[Appalachian Mountains]], but U.S. critics criticized the accented performances as inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Haines | first=Lester | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/13/calcutta_born_welsh/ | title=US film critics slap Calcutta-born Welsh | work=[[The Register]] | date=February 13, 2007 | accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh-accented performances are uncommon in blockbuster films, though director [[Peter Jackson]] requested for Welsh-born actor [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] to use his native accent for his character in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' films]]. The decision also led to casting Welsh-accented actors to portray the character's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Owens | first=David | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/luke-evans-gets-hobbit-using-6926122 | title=Luke Evans gets in The Hobbit of using Welsh accent as Bard the Bowman in Desolation of Smaug | work=[[WalesOnline]] | date=April 6, 2014 | accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An upcoming film about the gay Welsh rugby player [[Gareth Thomas (rugby)|Gareth Thomas]] will star actor [[Mickey Rourke]] as the player; the role will involve Rourke adapting a Welsh accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Bevan | first=Nathan | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/mickey-rourke-pictures-hint-gareth-6524609 | title=Could Mickey Rourke finally be set to tackle Gareth Thomas movie role? | work=[[WalesOnline]] | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian accents==

During the [[silent film]] era in the United States, Russian-born actors like [[Alla Nazimova]] were able to perform in roles even if they had Russian accents or could not speak English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advent of [[sound film]], Nazimova and other actors were not able to transition to speaking performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2007|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Hollywood released ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]'', a film about Imperial Russia, though the film featured no Russian actors, and the cast did not attempt to use Russian accents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2007|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1933 film ''[[Crime and Punishment (1935 American film)|Crime and Punishment]]'', based on the Russian novel [[Crime and Punishment|of the same name]], did not depict any characters with Russian accents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2007|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' was released in 1971 with no significant Russian actors and no Russian accents depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2007|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, actor [[Akim Tamiroff]], despite a thick Russian accent, was actively in film from the 1930s to the 1970s and featured prominently as a sidekick in films like ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2007|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Ouspenskaya]], active from 1915 through 1949, was also known for her "unusual accent" and was often cast in "grandmotherly" roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2007|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South African accents==

{{main|South African English}}

Ronald Bergan, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', said in 2010 that South African accents were "notoriously difficult" for actors to speak. Bergan said actor [[Marlon Brando]], who attempted foreign accents, was not able to convey a South African one in ''[[A Dry White Season]]'' (1989). Bergan also called "worthy but inconsistent efforts" the performances of [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Kevin Kline]] in ''[[Cry Freedom]]'' (1987) and that of [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in ''[[Blood Diamond (film)|Blood Diamond]]'' (2006). Of the 2009 film ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'', Bergan said of [[Morgan Freeman]]'s and [[Matt Damon]]'s performances, "For most audiences... who don't have an ear especially attuned to the nuances of South African accents, Freeman and Damon will sound authentic enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Bergan | first=Ronald | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/jan/19/foreign-accents-film | title=Why Hollywood should abolish the ministry of silly accents | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=January 19, 2010 | accessdate=September 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of accents in the United States==

Lawrence Christon, writing in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in 2007, said in U.S. film in the first half of the twentieth century, "actors spoke in a kind of neutralized Midwestern dialect," with actors like [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] having distinct qualities. Actor [[John Wayne]] conveyed a similar dialect even as the Mongol ruler [[Genghis Khan]] in the 1956 film ''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' with little objection. The [[French New Wave]] in the 1950s and the 1960s imported films, including ''[[La dolce vita]]'', ''[[The 400 Blows]]'', ''[[Hiroshima mon amour]]'', and exposed U.S. film audiences to new accents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Christon | first=Lawrence | url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/hollywood-more-accepting-of-accents-1117975653/ | title=Hollywood more accepting of accents | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=November 8, 2007 | accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said in 2000, "Once upon a time, what characters said in a film was more important than how they said it. For years, Hollywood played fast and loose with foreign accents, generally relying on a stable of European character actors to provide international flavor, with the overall attitude being something along the lines of 'one accent fits all.'" The newspaper said many credited [[Meryl Streep]] "for raising the accent bar" with her portrayal of a Polish woman in the 1982 film ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]''. Streep subsequently performed with other accents and became the standard against which other actors' accented performances were compared.&lt;ref name="baskin"&gt;{{cite news | last=Baskin | first=Ellen | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/04/entertainment/ca-37233 | title=A Pronounced Trend | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=June 4, 2000 | accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' said in 2002 that female actors, including Streep and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], had more success in accented performances than male actors.&lt;ref name="valdespino"&gt;{{cite news | last=Valdespino | first=Anne | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/23/entertainment/et-valdespino23 | title=Acting in the Thick of Accents | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 23, 2002 | accessdate=September 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Escape from Alcatraz''' is the name for two different [[triathlon]]s held in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of [[California]]. The Escape from Alcatraz originated in 1981 as a private club event, beginning in San Francisco and ending in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]]. The race split in 1983 with a separate commercial event open to the public, which is now an [[aquathlon]] (having dropped the [[biking]] section of a traditional triathlon) held on a shorter course entirely within San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alcatrazchallenge.us/about.html "About the Alcatraz Aquathlon &amp; Swim"], based on an article written by Katherine Vaz in the 1983 summer edition of ''Triathlon Magazine,'' accessed April 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, a new public triathlon, also known by the name Escape from Alcatraz, is now run by [[IMG (company)|IMG]].

==Original Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon==
The first Escape from Alcatraz was proposed by Joe Oakes after he participated in the 1979 [[Ironman Triathlon]] in [[Hawaii]]. The first Escape from Alcatraz race was held two years later in June 1981, with members of the [[Dolphin Club]] testing the course. The course started with a swim from [[Alcatraz Island]] in the middle of [[San Francisco Bay]] to the city of [[San Francisco]], a bike ride over the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] to [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]] in [[Marin County]], and an out-and-back running course over [[Mount Tamalpais]] to [[Stinson Beach, California|Stinson Beach]] and back. The running course followed the course of the [[Dipsea]] foot race, but by making it an out-and-back run rather than a one-way course, became known as a ''Double Dipsea''. 
The course has remained the same over the years and celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2015. Participants are limited to members of the Dolphin Club and The South End Club. The Dolphin Club is the host and sponsor of the event.&lt;ref&gt;EFAT Website: http://dcefat.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon (IMG)==
The annual public Escape from Alcatraz triathlon, organized by [[IMG (company)|IMG]], now takes place in early June. The current course consists of a {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|adj=mid|spell=in}} swim starting near Alcatraz Island, a {{convert|1/2|mi|km|adj=mid|spell=in}} run from the bay to the transition zone at [[Marina Green]], an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=mid|spell=in}} bike ride, and an {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=mid|spell=in}} run. The run portion includes a notorious section called the "[[Dutch sand ladder|sand ladder]]" at mile five, a climb from [[Baker Beach]] back up to the road that is a combination of sand and about 400 uneven log steps. The event had about 1700 participants in 2009. Entry is by Lottery process for most of the slots and the remainder is through qualification, which done through a good rank in the previous Escape from Alcatraz, or in four other triathlon races held during the preceding year.

The Escape from Alcatraz triathlon was ranked as the number-one triathlon by ''Inside Triathlon Magazine'' for 2006.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

'''Genius''' (formerly '''Rap Genius''') is an American [[digital media]] company. Originally founded in August 2009 by Tom Lehman, Ilan Zechory, and [[Mahbod Moghadam]], the site allows [[user-generated content|users]] to provide annotations and interpretation of song lyrics, news stories, sources, poetry, and documents.

Originally launched as Rap Genius with a focus on [[hip-hop music]], the company attracted the attention and support of celebrities, and [[venture capital]] enabling further growth.&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; The site expanded in 2014 to cover other forms of media, such as [[pop music|pop]], literature, [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], and added an annotation-embedded platform. That same year, an [[iPhone]] app was released. To reflect these new goals, the site re-launched as Genius in July 2014. An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was released in August 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xda-developers.com/xda-picks-best-apps-of-the-week-aug-1-aug-8|title=XDA Picks: Best Apps of the Week (Aug 1 – Aug 8)|date=8 August 2015|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906120309/http://www.xda-developers.com/xda-picks-best-apps-of-the-week-aug-1-aug-8/|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 and 2017, the company began producing music-focused original video content and hosting live events and concerts.

===Founding and early years (2009–2012)===

Genius first started as a [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] hip-hop focused site, and was originally named '''Rap Exegesis'''.

====Initial funding====
In 2011, with the site "drawing over 1 million unique visitors per month",&lt;ref name="Greenburg 2012"/&gt; Rap Genius applied to start-up incubator [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]], and "became the fastest-growing start-up in Y Combinator history",&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; obtaining $1.8 million in [[seed funding]], which enabled the founders to occupy offices on [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; In 2012, the company received an additional $15 million investment from Silicon Valley–based venture capital firm [[Andreessen Horowitz]] (also known as a16z),&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Voice"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/rap-genius-andreessen-horowitz/|title=Ben Horowitz And The Founders Explain Why a16z Put $15M Into Rap Genius: “Knowledge About Knowledge”|first=Josh|last=Constine|publisher=''[[TechCrunch]]''|date=October 3, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707194412/https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/rap-genius-andreessen-horowitz/|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompted in part by partner [[Marc Andreessen]]'s own past effort to build a group annotation feature into a web browser.&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; [[Ben Horowitz]] described Genius as "one of the most important things we've ever funded".&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; The company's three co-founders were named to the [[Forbes 30 Under 30]] in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/special-report/2012/30-under-30/30-under-30_music.html|title=30 Under 30: Music|first=Zack|last=O'Malley Greenburg|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|date=December 17, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515171053/https://www.forbes.com/special-report/2012/30-under-30/30-under-30_music.html|archivedate=15 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Establishment of verified accounts====
The popular success of the venture was exemplified by the participation of artists like [[Queensbridge Houses|Queensbridge]] rapper [[Nas]],&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; [[50 Cent]],&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; [[RZA]],&lt;ref name="Greenburg 2012"/&gt; and [[A$AP Rocky]],&lt;ref name="Greenburg 2012"/&gt; prompting the company to create a "Verified Artists" designation.&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenburg 2012"/&gt; Verified accounts are offered to established artists, where they annotate, moderate and edit their own lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/verified-artists List of verified artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828215138/https://genius.com/verified-artists |date=28 August 2017 }} on Genius&lt;/ref&gt; Such annotations are highlighted in green, rather than the usual grey. Nas became the first verified artist, using the platform to post numerous explanations of his lyrics and dispel some misinterpretations,&lt;ref name="Greenburg 2012"/&gt; as well as to comment on the lyrics of other rappers he admires.&lt;ref name="Greenburg 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Nas Nas verified account on Rap Genius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612220715/http://genius.com/Nas |date=12 June 2016 }} Accessed: 16 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/posts/Nas-interview-why-nas-wants-to-explain-his-own-lyrics-on-rap-genius NAS INTERVIEW: why Nas wants to annotate his own lyrics on Rap Genius] Accessed: 16 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his support for the website, Nas "released the lyrics to his new single '[[The Don (Nas song)|The Don]]' on Rap Genius the day before putting out the song itself".&lt;ref name="Greenburg 2012"/&gt;

[[Masta Killa]], [[Inspectah Deck]], [[RZA]], [[GZA]], [[Ghostface Killah]] and [[Raekwon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, members of the American [[hip-hop]] group [[Wu-Tang Clan]], also obtained verified accounts on Genius.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/RZA RZA verified account on Rap Genius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318230112/http://genius.com/RZA |date=18 March 2016 }} Accessed: 16 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/GZA GZA verified account on Rap Genius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321191126/http://genius.com/GZA |date=21 March 2016 }} Accessed: 24 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Raekwon Raekwon verified account on Rap Genius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061753/http://genius.com/Raekwon |date=4 March 2016 }} Accessed: 24 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/GhostfaceKillah718|title=Ghostface Killah|work=Genius|accessdate=25 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725213733/http://genius.com/GhostfaceKillah718|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012, novelist Bacchus Paine became the first current release prose author to voluntarily annotate part of her own work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/No-Church-Wild-Hypomnema-Hypersexuality/dp/1480215082 No Church Wild] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229064511/https://www.amazon.com/No-Church-Wild-Hypomnema-Hypersexuality/dp/1480215082 |date=29 December 2016 }} Accessed: 16 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early controversies (2013–2014) ===
In an effort to extend the concept into other genres of culture, Genius launched several new channels in 2013 including News Genius, [[Rock music|Rock]] Genius, and [[Poetry]] Genius. The service also added the ability for outside publishers to integrate Rap Genius's platform into other websites to create annotated articles.&lt;ref name="bi-geniusstory"/&gt; However, the company also experienced some issues familiar to the online content field.

==== Music publishing dispute ====
In October 2013, Rap Genius was one of fifty sites targeted with notices by the [[National Music Publishers Association]] for the unlicensed online publication of song lyrics. Unlike Genius, most of the sites that were targeted were ad-supported. In response, Zechory stated that they "can't wait to have a conversation with them about how all writers can participate in and benefit from the Rap Genius knowledge project".&lt;ref name=bb-nmpatakedown&gt;{{cite web|title=NMPA Targets Unlicensed Lyric Sites, Rap Genius Among 50 Sent Take-Down Notices|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/5785701/nmpa-targets-unlicensed-lyric-sites-rap-genius-among|work=Billboard.biz|accessdate=12 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111234749/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/5785701/nmpa-targets-unlicensed-lyric-sites-rap-genius-among|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Rap Genius entered into a licensing agreement with music publishers covering both past and future publishing of music lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/business/media/rap-genius-website-agrees-to-license-with-music-publishers.html|title=Rap Genius Website Agrees to License With Music Publishers|first=Ben|last=Sisario|date=6 May 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229064656/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/business/media/rap-genius-website-agrees-to-license-with-music-publishers.html|archivedate=29 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Google search penalty ====
In December 2013, [[Google]] penalized Rap Genius for violating their backlinks guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lehman|first1=Tom|last2=Zechory|first2=Ilan|last3=Moghadam|first3=Mahbod|title=Rap Genius is Back on Google|url=https://genius.com/Genius-founders-rap-genius-is-back-on-google-annotated|website=Genius|accessdate=14 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520222817/http://genius.com/Genius-founders-rap-genius-is-back-on-google-annotated|archivedate=20 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular participating in blog networks, by removing them from its top [[Google search|search results]].&lt;ref name="searchengineland_penalty"&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Has Officially Penalized Rap Genius For Link Schemes |url=http://searchengineland.com/google-has-officially-penalized-rap-genius-for-link-schemes-180777 |publisher=Search Engine Land |date=25 December 2013 |accessdate=25 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225233539/http://searchengineland.com/google-has-officially-penalized-rap-genius-for-link-schemes-180777 |archivedate=25 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techcrunch_penalty"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rap Genius Apologizes For Not-So-Genius SEO Spam Tactics |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/24/rap-genius-apologizes-for-not-so-genius-seo-spam-tactics/ |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |date=24 December 2013 |accessdate=25 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224225615/http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/24/rap-genius-apologizes-for-not-so-genius-seo-spam-tactics/ |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even for the search query of "rap genius", results from rapgenius.com did not appear on the top results. Instead, the top results showed Rap Genius' [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Wikipedia]] pages, as well as news related to the penalty.&lt;ref name="searchengineland_penalty"/&gt; This happened after blogger and Rap Genius contributor John Marbach exposed its link scheme to manipulate Google search results by offering Tweets or Facebook shares in exchange for linking to Rap Genius with keyword rich texts.&lt;ref name="marbach"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marbach |first=John |title=RapGenius Growth Hack Exposed |url=http://jmarbach.com/rapgenius-growth-hack-exposed |date=23 December 2013 |accessdate=25 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224024907/http://jmarbach.com/rapgenius-growth-hack-exposed |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rap Genius posted an apology, promising to stop and reverse the practice. Rap Genius also pointed out that its competitors were doing similar or worse practices, and asked Google to look at "the whole lyrics search landscape" and improve its lyric search results.&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;{{cite news |title=Open Letter to Google About Rap Genius SEO |url=http://news.rapgenius.com/Rap-genius-founders-open-letter-to-google-about-rap-genius-seo-lyrics |publisher=Rap Genius |date=24 December 2013 |accessdate=25 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224235351/http://news.rapgenius.com/Rap-genius-founders-open-letter-to-google-about-rap-genius-seo-lyrics |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten days later, after removing links in violation of Google's Quality Guidelines, Rap Genius partially recovered from their penalty.&lt;ref name="reinstatement"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rap Genius Back In Google After 10 Day Penalty, Ranks For Its Name But What About Lyrics? |url=http://searchengineland.com/rap-genius-back-in-google-181125 |publisher=Search Engine Land |date=4 January 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107075642/http://searchengineland.com/rap-genius-back-in-google-181125 |archivedate=7 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Resignation of Mahbod Moghadam ====
''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' named Rap Genius co-founder Mahbod Moghadam to its list of Most Creative People of 2013 in May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3009237/91-mahbod-moghadam|title=91.

=== Expansion and rebranding (2014–2015) ===
====New apps and features====
The company rebounded with the release of an [[iOS]] [[Application software|app]] on January 28, 2014, also called "Genius".&lt;ref name="Plaugic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/4/9094941/genius-android-app-ios-redesign|title=Genius finally launches an Android app, redesigns its website and iOS app|publisher=''[[The Verge]]''|first=Lizzie|last=Plaugic|date=August 4, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224202954/http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/4/9094941/genius-android-app-ios-redesign|archivedate=24 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genius co-founder Tom Lehman said at launch: "This is the true launch of Rap Genius. Right now, more than half of our traffic comes from mobile devices. Soon, it will be 100%".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genius for iPhone is here!|url=http://news.rapgenius.com/Rap-genius-genius-for-iphone-is-here-annotated|publisher=Rap Genius|accessdate=25 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326104050/http://news.rapgenius.com/Rap-genius-genius-for-iphone-is-here-annotated|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Genius launched a feature allowing users to "embed" annotated texts on other websites. [[Felix Salmon]] of Reuters was a noted early user, using the platform to create an annotated breakdown of [[Janet Yellen]]'s first [[FOMC]] statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salmon|first=Felix|title=Janet Yellen’s first FOMC statement, annotated|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/03/19/janet-yellens-first-fomc-statement-annotated/|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=25 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324041716/http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/03/19/janet-yellens-first-fomc-statement-annotated/|archivedate=24 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nas]] embedded the entire annotated ''[[Illmatic]]'' album onto his website to promote the release of ''Illmatic XX''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasirjones.com/news/208213#annotations/3012705|title=Rap Genius &amp; Nas Breakdown "Illmatic" in its Entirety|publisher=[[Nas]]|date=18 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504140028/http://www.nasirjones.com/news/208213#annotations/3012705|archivedate=4 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Re-launch as "Genius" and expanded funding====
On 12 July 2014, reflecting its recent expansions and growth into a platform, Rap Genius re-launched as Genius. The co-founders said that the change was because most internet users fail to "dive into" stories they find in greater detail, and that Genius aimed to "help us all realize the richness and depth in every line of text".&lt;ref name="bi-geniusstory"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Inside Story Of How Rap Genius Fired A Cofounder — And Just Raised $40 Million (Annotated!)|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-inside-story-of-how-rap-genius-fired-a-cofounder--and-just-raised-40-million-annotated-2014-7|accessdate=12 July 2014|agency=Business Insider|date=12 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711220953/http://www.businessinsider.com/the-inside-story-of-how-rap-genius-fired-a-cofounder--and-just-raised-40-million-annotated-2014-7|archivedate=11 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-genius&gt;{{cite web|title=Rap Genius rebrands itself 'Genius' as part of mission to 'annotate the world'|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/11/5891889/rap-genius-rebrands-as-genius-in-mission-to-annotate-the-world|publisher=''[[The Verge]]''|accessdate=12 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712004046/http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/11/5891889/rap-genius-rebrands-as-genius-in-mission-to-annotate-the-world|archivedate=12 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also raised an additional $40 million in series B funding led by investor [[Dan Gilbert (businessman)|Dan Gilbert]], chairman of [[Quicken Loans]] and owner of the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Constine|first1=Josh|title=Rap Genius Raises $40M, Changes Name To Genius, Launches Embeddable Annotations|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/11/just-genius/|accessdate=12 September 2014|publisher=Tech Crunch|date=11 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912024835/http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/11/just-genius/|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its operations expanding, Genius relocated from [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] to [[Gowanus, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gowanus-passes-sniff-test-for-some-startups-1406683589|title=Gowanus Passes Sniff Test for Some Startups|first=Laura|last=Kusisto|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|date=July 29, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730055533/http://www.wsj.com/articles/gowanus-passes-sniff-test-for-some-startups-1406683589|archivedate=30 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/abandoned-gowanus-building-reinvented-article-1.2142919|title=Creative office tenant Cowork.rs snags big space at formerly abandoned Gowanus building|first=Katherine|last=Clarke|publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''|date=March 9, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322054345/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/abandoned-gowanus-building-reinvented-article-1.2142919|archivedate=22 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lynch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; Genius also obtained buy-in from artists, including investments by [[Eminem]], [[Nas]], and [[Pharrell Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6752952/eminem-partner-genius|title=Eminem To Invest In Genius: Exclusive|first=Adelle|last=Platon|publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|date=November 4, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625141915/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6752952/eminem-partner-genius|archivedate=25 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, rapper [[Kanye West]], a fan of the site, submitted a mock up of a redesign to investor [[Ben Horowitz]].&lt;ref name=Kanye&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'ONFRO|first1=Jillian|title=Kanye West Tried To Redesign Rap Genius|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/kanye-west-tried-to-redesign-rap-genius-2014-7|website=Business Insider|accessdate=23 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717035246/http://www.businessinsider.com/kanye-west-tried-to-redesign-rap-genius-2014-7|archivedate=17 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redesign was not used although Lehman was impressed, telling ''Business Insider'' that future redesigns could use elements from it.&lt;ref name=Kanye/&gt; In mid-2015, along with its redesigned logo and webpage, Genius released its [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app, which initially allowed users to search for and vote on annotations.&lt;ref name="Plaugic"/&gt;

==Features==
Works and articles on Genius are presented with various lines highlighted in grey; by clicking on these lines, pop-up annotations are displayed which provide additional details and context for the section in question. Users can provide their own annotations by highlighting fragments of text. Texts on Genius are sorted into various topic channels, including rap, rock, and pop music, literature, news, historical texts (History Genius), sports, television and film (Screen Genius), and "X"—any other subject not covered by other categories. The site also offers the "Rap Map", a [[Google Maps]] display featuring profiles and placemarks for geographical locations related to rap culture or mentioned in rap songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://map.rapgenius.com/ |title=The Rap Map — Mapping the Gangsta Terrain of the Planet |publisher=Rap Genius |date=21 February 1965 |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614070022/http://map.rapgenius.com/ |archivedate=14 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registered users can upload, correct, and annotate texts. They can also offer suggestions to improve already published texts and annotations. Editors and Moderators help to generate and monitor content to ensure quality writing. Users earn "IQ" with every published annotation. Points are rewarded on the basis of not only the quantity of text that is annotated, but also the quality of the annotations. Users are rewarded with greater editorial and moderating privileges as more IQ points are awarded.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rapgenius.com/static/about |title=About |publisher=Rap Genius |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713013201/http://rapgenius.com/static/about |archivedate=13 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors to Genius receive points, "IQ", for annotations and suggestions on each channel. The IQ system employs both direct points, for example a 10 IQ point increase for an annotation, and a voting system. Especially insightful and popular annotations gain positive reviews, increasing the IQ value of an annotation. As of now, IQ has no redemption purpose, but serves as measure of a contributor's impact and work on the site. Editors and Moderators gain additional means of obtaining IQ, including publishing completed texts and reviewing the work of others.

'''George Bradshaw''' (29 July 1800 – 6 September 1853) was an English [[cartographer]], [[printer (publisher)|printer]] and publisher. He developed [[Bradshaw's Guide]], a widely sold series of combined railway guides and [[Public transport timetable|timetables]].

==Biography==
Bradshaw was born at Windsor Bridge, [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], Lancashire. On leaving school he was apprenticed to an [[engraver]] named Beale in [[Manchester]], and in 1820 he set up his own engraving business in [[Belfast]], returning to Manchester in 1822 to set up as an engraver and printer, principally of [[map]]s. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was a religious man.  Although his parents were not exceptionally wealthy, when he was young they enabled him to take [[lesson]]s from a minister devoted to the teachings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].  He joined the [[Society of Friends]] (the Quakers) and gave a considerable part of his time to [[philanthropy|philanthropic work]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  He worked a great deal with radical reformers such as [[Richard Cobden]] in organising peace conferences and in setting up schools and [[soup kitchen]]s for the poor of Manchester. {{sfn|Boase|1886|p. 175}}

It is his belief as a Quaker that is quoted as causing the early editions of Bradshaw's guides to have avoided using the names of months based upon [[List of Roman deities|Roman deities]] which was seen as "pagan" usage.  Quaker usage was, and sometimes still is, "First month" for January, "Second month" for February and so on. Days of the week were "First day" for Sunday and so on.

In 1841, he founded a high-quality weekly magazine, edited by George Falkner, called ''Bradshaw's Manchester Journal'', described as "a 16-page miscellany of art, science and literature, to sell at the cheap price of a penny-halfpenny a week. ...

==Bradshaw's railway guides==
{{main|Bradshaw's Guide}}
'''''Bradshaw's''''' was a series of railway [[Public transport timetable|timetables]] and travel [[guide book]]s published by W.J. Adams of London. George Bradshaw initiated the series in 1839. The ''Bradshaw's'' range of titles continued after his death in 1853 until 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=John Leighton |title=Early Railway Guides: a Retrospective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4YhAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA774 |work=Chambers's Journal |volume=9 |date=3 November 1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bradshawsguides.com/the-bradshaw-lagacy.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917211726/http://bradshawsguides.com/the-bradshaw-lagacy.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 September 2013 |title=Bradshaw Legacy |work=Bradshaw's Guides |publisher=Old House Books &amp; Maps |location=UK |accessdate=24 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Great British Railway Journeys/Great Continental Railway Journeys''==
Former British politician [[Michael Portillo]] used a copy of what was described as a Bradshaw's guide (the 1863 edition of ''Bradshaw's Descriptive Railway Hand-Book of Great Britain and Ireland'') for ''[[Great British Railway Journeys]]'', a [[BBC Two]] television series in which he travelled across Britain, visiting recommended points of interest noted in Bradshaw's guide book, and where possible staying in recommended hotels.

The first series was broadcast in early 2010, a second in early 2011, a third in early 2012, and a fourth in early 2013; series 5 was broadcast in January and February 2014. The success of the series sparked a new interest in the guides and facsimile copies of the 1863 edition became an unexpected best seller in the UK in 2011.

At the end of 2012, a new series, ''[[Great Continental Railway Journeys]]'', was broadcast with Portillo using the 1913 edition of ''Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide'' to make journeys through various European countries and territories, prompting two publishers to produce facsimiles of the handbook. A second series was broadcast in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/journeysbyrail/9666372/Bradshaw-the-man-behind-the-guide.html|title=Bradshaw: the man behind the guide|last=Kerr|first=Michael |date=9 Nov 2012|work=The Telegraph|publisher= Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hendrik Jacobus Scholten''' (1824 in [[Amsterdam]] &amp;ndash; 1907 in [[Heemstede]]), was a 19th-century painter from the [[Netherlands]].

==Biography==
According to the RKD he was a pupil of [[Petrus Franciscus Greive]] and [[Lambertus Johannes Hansen]].&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/70908 Hendrik Jacobus Scholten] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852 he became a member of the Royal Academy of Art in Amsterdam, and was a member of the Amsterdam art societies [[Arti et Amicitiae]], Kunstbevorderend Genootschap V.W.,  and Vereeniging Sint Lucas.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; He was also a member of art societies in other towns, such as the [[Pulchri studio]] in the Hague, the Schilder- en teekengenootschap Kunstliefde in Utrecht, and [[Kunst zij ons doel]] in Haarlem.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; He became art [[Conservator (museum)|conservator]] of the [[Teylers Stichting]] in 1872, which manages the art collection of the [[Teylers Museum]].&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; In that capacity he wrote a catalog of the museum's collection, that was published in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''Musée Teyler à Haarlem.

[[File:Hereford-Karte.jpg|thumb|350px|Hereford mappa mundi]]
The '''Hereford Mappa Mundi''' is a medieval map of the known world ([[mappa mundi]] in Latin), of a form deriving from the [[T and O map|T and O]] pattern, &lt;!-- see "Mappa mundi#Complex maps" --&gt; dating from c. 1300. It is displayed at [[Hereford Cathedral]] in [[Hereford]], England.&lt;ref name="Edson 1997"&gt;Edson, Evelyn (1997) ''Mapping Time and Space: How Medieval Mapmakers Viewed Their World'', The British Library&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest medieval map still known to exist.

The  Hereford Mappa Mundi hung, with little regard, for many years on a wall of a choir aisle in the cathedral. During the troubled times of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the map had been laid beneath the floor of Bishop Audley's Chantry, where it remained secreted for some time. In 1855 it was cleaned and repaired at the [[British Museum]]. During the Second World War, for safety reasons, the mappa mundi and other valuable manuscripts from [[Hereford Cathedral Library]] were kept elsewhere and returned to the collection in 1946.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hereford Mappa Mundi: Journey to Hereford|last=Alington|first=Gabriel|publisher=Cromwell Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Trowbridge, Wiltshire|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, a financial crisis in the [[Diocese of Hereford]] caused the Dean and Chapter to propose selling the mappa mundi.&lt;ref name="Driver1988"&gt;{{cite news|title=World time forgot: the 13th-century world map up for sale is not the only neglected treasure of Hereford Cathedral|last=Driver|first=Christopher|date=19 November 1988|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much controversy, large donations from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], [[Paul Getty]] and members of the public kept the map in Hereford and allowed the construction of a new library to house the map and the chained libraries from the Cathedral and All Saints' Church. The new Library Building in the south east corner of the [[cathedral close]] opened in 1996.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An open-access high-resolution digital image of the map with more than 1,000 place and name annotations is included among the thirteen medieval maps of the world edited in the [[Virtual Mappa]] project.

== Features ==
Drawn on a single sheet of [[vellum]], it measures 158&amp;nbsp;cm by 133&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref name="Edson 1997"/&gt; some {{convert|52|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter and is the largest medieval map known still to exist.&lt;!-- other sources: 165x135cm --&gt; The writing is in black ink, with additional red and gold, and blue or green for water (with the [[Red Sea]] (8) coloured red). It depicts 420 towns, 15 Biblical events, 33 animals and plants, 32 people, and five scenes from classical mythology.&lt;ref name="Edson 1997"/&gt;

[[Jerusalem]] is drawn at the centre of the circle; east is on top, showing the [[Garden of Eden]] in a circle at the edge of the world (1). Great Britain is drawn at the northwestern border (bottom left, 22 &amp; 23). Curiously, the labels for Africa and Europe are reversed, with Europe scribed in red and gold as "Africa", and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Edson 1997"/&gt;

The map is based on traditional accounts and earlier maps such as the one of the [[Beatus of Liébana]] codex, and is very similar to the [[Ebstorf map]], the [[Psalter world map]], and the ''Sawley'' (erroneously for considerable time called "Henry of Mainz") map; it does not correspond to the geographical knowledge of the 14th century. Note, for example, that the [[Caspian Sea]] (5) connects to the encircling ocean (upper left). This is in spite of [[William of Rubruk]]'s having reported it to be landlocked in 1255, i.e. several decades before the map's creation; see also [[Portolan chart]].

The "T and O" shape does not imply that its creators believed in a [[flat Earth]]. &lt;!-- remember quadripartite Beatus-style maps with "antipodes", on this! --&gt;The [[Spherical Earth|spherical shape of the Earth]] was already known to the [[Classical antiquity|ancient Greeks and Romans]] and the idea was never entirely forgotten even in the [[Middle Ages]], and thus the circular representation may well be considered a conventional attempt at a [[map projection|projection]]: in spite of the acceptance of a spherical Earth, only the known parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] were believed to be inhabitable by human beings (see [[antipodes]]), so that the circular representation remained adequate. The long river on the far right is the [[River Nile]], too (12), and the T shape is established by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (19-21-25) and the rivers [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (13) and Nile (16). It is the first map to mention the [[Faroe Islands]].

== Authorship ==
The map is signed by or attributed to one "Richard of Haldingham and [[Sleaford|Lafford]]", also known as Richard de Bello, "[[prebend]] of Lafford in Lincoln Cathedral". However, this attribution isn't completely agreed upon, it being suggested that the exquisite level of detail included in the map could not have been completed by one person. Some people believe that the map was originally created by Richard of Haldingham and Lafford and that at his death it passed to his younger cousin, Richard de Bello. Once it was in de Bello's possession, de Bello and his patron Richard Swindfield worked on the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Great Maps: The World's Masterpieces Explored and Explained|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|publisher=DK Publishing|year=2014|isbn=1465424636|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was for long believed the map was not created in Hereford. It was believed to have been made in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], since the city of Lincoln is drawn in considerable detail, being represented by a cathedral located on a hill near a river. Hereford, on the other hand, is represented only by a cathedral and seems an afterthought, drawn by a different hand than many of the other things on the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mappa Mundi: The Hereford World Map|last=Harvey|first=P. D. A.|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent research, including the origin of wood used for the frame which corresponds with a compass hole in the map, suggests it may have in fact been created in or around Hereford.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-32900232&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4553">A '''Jacobi operator''', also known as '''Jacobi matrix''', is a symmetric [[linear operator]] acting on [[sequence]]s which is given by an infinite [[tridiagonal matrix]]. It is commonly used to specify systems of [[orthogonal polynomials|orthonormal polynomials]] over a finite, positive [[Borel measure]]. This operator is named after [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]].

The name derives from a theorem from Jacobi, dating to 1848, stating that every [[symmetric matrix]] over a [[principal ideal domain]] is congruent to a tridiagonal matrix.

== Self-adjoint Jacobi operators ==
The most important case is the one of self-adjoint Jacobi operators acting on the [[Hilbert space]] of square summable sequences over the [[positive integers]] &lt;math&gt;\ell^2(\mathbb{N})&lt;/math&gt;. In this case it is given by

:&lt;math&gt;Jf_0 = a_0 f_1 + b_0 f_0, \quad Jf_n =  a_n f_{n+1} + b_n f_n + a_{n-1} f_{n-1}, \quad n&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients are assumed to satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;a_n &gt;0, \quad b_n \in \mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

The operator will be bounded if and only if the coefficients are.

There are close connections with the theory of [[orthogonal polynomials]]. In fact, the solution &lt;math&gt;p_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; of the [[recurrence relation]]

:&lt;math&gt; J\, p_n(x) = x\, p_n(x), \qquad p_0(x)=1 \text{ and } p_{-1} (x)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

is a polynomial of degree ''n'' and these polynomials are [[orthonormal]] with respect to the [[spectral measure]] corresponding to the first basis vector &lt;math&gt;\delta_{1,n}&lt;/math&gt;.

This recurrence relation is also commonly written as
:&lt;math&gt;xp_n(x)=a_{n+1}p_{n+1}(x) + b_n p_n(x) + a_np_{n-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
It arises in many areas of mathematics and physics. The case ''a''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is known as the discrete one-dimensional [[Schrödinger operator]]. It also arises in:

* The [[Lax pair]] of the [[Toda lattice]].
* The three-term recurrence relationship of [[orthogonal polynomials]], orthogonal over a positive and finite [[Borel measure]].
* Algorithms devised to calculate [[Gaussian quadrature|Gaussian quadrature rules]], derived from systems of orthogonal polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.unipd.it/~alvise/PAPERS/meurant_sommariva12.pdf Fast variants of the Golub and Welsch algorithm for symmetric weight functions – Gérard Meurant]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalizations ==
When one considers [[Bergman space]], namely the space of [[square-integrable]] [[holomorphic functions]] over some domain, then, under general circumstances, one can give that space a basis of orthogonal polynomials, the [[Bergman polynomial]]s. In this case, the analog of the tridiagonal Jacobi operator is a [[Hessenberg operator]] – an infinite-dimensional [[Hessenberg matrix]]. The system of orthogonal polynomials is given by

:&lt;math&gt;zp_n(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} D_{kn} p_k(z)&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;p_0(z)=1&lt;/math&gt;. Here, ''D'' is the Hessenberg operator that generalizes the tridiagonal Jacobi operator ''J'' for this situation.&lt;ref&gt;V. Tomeo, E. Torrano, "Two applications of the subnormality of the Hessenberg matrix related to general orthogonal polynomials", ''Linear Algebra and its Applications'' (2011) Volume 435, Issue 9, Pages 2314-2320, DOI=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.laa.2011.04.027 URL=http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/8725/contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward B. Saff and Nikos Stylianopoulos, "Asymptotics for Hessenberg matrices for the Bergman shift operator on Jordan region", (2012) arXiv:1205.4183 [math.CV] URL=https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Escribano and Antonio Giraldo and M. Asunción Sastre and Emilio Torrano, "The Hessenberg matrix and the Riemann mapping" (2011){arXiv:1107.603 [math.SP] URL=https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.6036&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that ''D'' is the right-[[shift operator]] on the Bergman space: that is, it is given by

:&lt;math&gt;[Df](z) = zf(z)&lt;/math&gt;

The zeros of the Bergman polynomial &lt;math&gt;p_n(z)&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the [[eigenvalue]]s of the principle &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; submatrix of ''D''.  That is, The Bergman polynomials are the [[characteristic polynomial]]s for the principle submatrixes of the shift operator.

'''Joseph Whiting Stock''' (January 30, 1815 – 1855) was an American painter known for his portraits, miniatures, and landscape paintings, many of which he did on commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

When Stock was eleven years old, an oxcart fell on him and he was [[paraplegic]] for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/66.242.19 |title=Joseph Whiting Stock: John and Louisa Stock (66.242.19) &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |first= |last= |work=metmuseum.org |year=|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this accident, he began to study painting under Franklin White, a pupil of the painter [[Chester Harding (painter)|Chester Harding]], on the advice of his physician, and was commissioned to do a series of anatomical drawings by Dr. James Swan in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/artist-info.1906.html?artistId=1906&amp;pageNumber=1 National Gallery of Art: The Collection: Joseph Whiting Stock]&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Dr. Swan constructed a wheelchair which enabled Stock to paint large canvasses and be lifted on trains so as to travel for commissions. For the next two decades Stock accepted commissions for portraits around New England, working in [[Warren, Rhode Island|Warren]] and [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], and [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]], [[Goshen, New York|Goshen]], and [[Port Jervis, New York|Port Jervis]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. His studios were located in his hometown of Springfield throughout this time.

In 1855, Stock died of tuberculosis in Springfield. He was forty years old.&lt;ref&gt;Stock, Joseph Whiting, and Juliette Tomlinson. 1976. The paintings and the journal of Joseph Whiting Stock. Middletown, Conn: Wesleyan University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stock's paintings are sometimes confused with those of [[Clarissa Peters Russell]], the miniaturist, as her style is similar to his but her work tends to be unsigned.

'''Laurentian Codex''' or Laurentian Chronicle ({{lang-ru|Лаврентьевский список, Лаврентьевская летопись}}) is a collection of chronicles that includes the oldest extant version of the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' and its continuations, mostly  relating the events in Northern Russia ([[Vladimir-Suzdal]]).

== The scribe and his source ==
The codex was not just copied by the [[Nizhny Novgorod|Nizhegorod]] monk Laurentius commissioned by [[Dionysius, Metropolitan of Kiev|Dionysius of Suzdil]] in 1377. The original text on events from 1284 to 1305 was a lost codex compiled for the Grand Duke [[Mikhail of Tver]] in 1305, but Laurentius re-edited the presentation of [[Yuri II of Vladimir|Yuri Vsevolodovich]], the founder of [[Nizhny Novgorod]], from positive into a negative, partly rehabilitating the role of Tatars. Vasily Komarovich studied traces of changes within the manuscript and established a hypothesis about differences between Laurentius' version and the lost one of the Tver chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}} The critical edition ([[#CritEd|1926-1928]]) presented the text with all its variants given in other chronicles.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The Laurentian Codex compiled several codices of the Vladimir chronicles. It is the second edition of Nestor's chronicle, which had been already revised in 1116 by Sylvester, Hegumen of the St. Michael Monastery in the village of Vydubychi, under the reign of Prince [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]], and it is the oldest version known today. The codex is a unique source for the autobiographical chronicle called “Instruction of Vladimir Monomakh”.

The first part until folio 40 verso was written by an unknown scribe commissioned by [[Andrey Bogolyubsky|Andrew Bogolyubsky]]. In 1177 it was completed after the assassination of the prince. The second chronicle about [[Vsevolod the Big Nest]] continued up to 1193. The third which did glorify Vsevolod, was composed in 1212 by his son Yuri Vsevolodovich. The Vladimir Chronicles borrowed from sources of the Southern Rus', especially from [[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi|Pereyaslavl Yuzhniy]], since Vladimir princes regarded the city as part of their patrimony.

The compilation referred to various periods until 1305, but the years 898–922, 1263–83 and 1288–94 had been omitted for reasons of censorship, and quite likely under supervision of Dionysios, Metropolitan of Kiev. The revision was done under great rush and another hand in the manuscript proves, that Laurentius' work was assisted by a second scribe whose hand can be found on the later added folios 157, 167, and on the verso side of folio 161.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://expositions.nlr.ru/LaurentianCodex/_Project/page_Description.php?page=1 description of the manuscript] in the documentation of the Russian National Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the manuscript ==
The manuscript was acquired by the famous [[Aleksei Musin-Pushkin|Count Musin-Pushkin]] in 1792 and subsequently presented to the [[Russian National Library]] in [[St Petersburg]] (Ms. [[#RUS-SPscMsFpIV2|F.п.IV.2]]).

King '''Leodegrance''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|oʊ|d|ᵻ|ɡ|r|æ|n|s}}, sometimes '''Leondegrance''', '''Leodogran''', or variations thereof, is the father of Queen [[Guinevere]] in [[Arthurian legend]]. His kingdom of [[Cameliard]] (or Carmelide) is usually identified with Cornwall but may be located in Breton [[Cornouaille]] near the town of [[Carhaix]], which is the Carhaise of ''[[Post-Vulgate Cycle|L'Histoire de Merlin]]'' (13th century). 

Leodegrance had served [[Uther Pendragon]], [[King Arthur]]'s biological father and regnal predecessor. Leodegrance was entrusted with the keeping of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] at Uther's death. When Guinevere marries Arthur, Leodegrance gives the young king the table as a wedding present. In later romance Leodegrance is one of the few kings who accept Arthur as his overlord. For this, his land is invaded by the rebel King [[Rience]], but Arthur comes to his rescue and expels the enemy. Arthur meets Guinevere for the first time during this excursion, and they develop a love that eventually results in their fateful marriage. 

According to the [[Lancelot–Grail]] Cycle, Leodegrance fathered a second daughter out of wedlock; he also names this child Guinevere. The "False Guinevere" later treacherously convinces Arthur's court that she is his real wife and her sister is an impostor, forcing the real queen and her lover [[Lancelot]] into hiding with their friend [[Galehaut]]. Guinevere eventually returns and reclaims her throne.

In [[Welsh mythology]] the father of ''Gwenhwyfar'' (Guinevere) is the giant '''Ogyruan/Ogyrvan''' or '''Gogyrfan''', who is mentioned in a number of [[Middle Welsh]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, Rachel (ed.). ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein''. Cardiff, revised ed. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Leodegrance was portrayed by [[Patrick Stewart]] in the 1981 film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]''.

Most '''countries of the world''' have '''different names''' in different languages. Some countries have also undergone name changes for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known alternative names for all nations, countries and sovereign states. It does not offer any opinion about what the "original", "real", or "correct" name of any country is or was.

Countries are listed alphabetically by their '''current best-known name in English'''. Each English name is followed by its currently best-known equivalents in other languages, listed in English alphabetical order (ignoring accents) by name and by language. Historical and/or alternative versions, where included, are noted as such. Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents are listed, to provide an answer to the question "What is that name in..."?. See also: [[List of alternative country names]]

Entries are formatted as follows: languages written in the Latin alphabet use "'''Name''' (language)" [for example, "'''Afeganistão''' (Portuguese)"] and are alphabetized in the list according to English rules of alphabetical order. Languages written in other [[writing system]]s use "'''Romanization''' - native script (language)" [for example, "'''English''' - אַרגענטינע (Yiddish)"] and are alphabetized in the list by the romanized form.

For reasons of size, this article is broken into four parts:
*[[List of country names in various languages (A–C)]]
*[[List of country names in various languages (D–I)]]
*[[List of country names in various languages (J–P)]]
*'''List of country names in various languages (Q–Z)'''

The '''''MCC Coaching Manual''''' is the popular name for ''The MCC Cricket Coaching Book'', a manual of [[cricket]] skills produced by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). The book outlined the traditional approaches to [[batting (cricket)|batting]], [[Bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]]. It was first published in 1952, written by [[Harry Altham]], and went through several editions before being superseded by ''[[MCC Masterclass: The New MCC Coaching Book]]'' in 1994. That book is now out of print, and has been replaced in the UK by a range of coaching resources from the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]].

In modern cricket, the MCC coaching manual is usually cited idiomatically in reference to orthodox techniques: a well-executed classical batting stroke may be described as "straight out of the coaching manual"[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/140247.html], while unorthodox shots such as the [[reverse sweep]] are ones "you wouldn't find in the MCC coaching manual."[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/239756.html]

The '''Maltese skate''' or '''Maltese ray''' (''Leucoraja melitensis'') is a species of [[fish]] in the [[Rajidae]] family. It is found in [[Algeria]], [[Italy]], [[Malta]], and [[Tunisia]]. Its natural [[habitat]] is open seas. It is threatened by [[habitat loss]].

== Sustainable consumption ==
In 2010, [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace International]] added the Maltese skate (''Leucoraja melitensis'') to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/ Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NSC 162/2''' was a [[National security directive#Truman and Eisenhower administrations|policy paper]] of the [[United States National Security Council]] approved by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on 30 October 1953 which defined the [[Cold War]] national security policy [[New Look (policy)|during the Eisenhower administration]].

==Massive retaliation==
NSC{{nbsp}}162/2 stated that the United States needs to maintain "a strong military posture, with emphasis on the capability of inflicting massive retaliatory damage by offensive striking power", and that, in the event of hostilities, the United States "will consider [[nuclear weapons]] as available for use as other munitions."

'''PastPerfect Museum Software''' is an [[application software|application]] for collections archiving. It is designed for museums, but may be used by various institutions including libraries, archives, and natural history collections. PastPerfect allows for the database storage of artifacts, documents, photographs, and library books.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, S. (2007). ''PastPerfect Software Review''. Retrieved from http://ercpierce.blogspot.com/2007/03/pastperfect-software-review.html&lt;/ref&gt; PastPerfect is utilized by over 9000 museums nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;PastPerfect Museum Software. (2015). ''Home Page.'' Retrieved from http://www.museumsoftware.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
PastPerfect was introduced in 1998 as the primary product of the then Pastime Software Company Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, S. (2007). ''PastPerfect'' software review. Retrieved from http://ercpierce.blogspot.com/2007/03/pastperfect-software-review.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in version 2 later the same year, updated to version three in 2001, and then to version four in 2004. It updated to version five in 2010, which remains the most current edition of the program. Pastime Software Company eventually changed its name to PastPerfect Software Inc. after 2007.&lt;ref&gt;PastPerfect Software Inc. (n.d.) ''Previous versions.'' Retrieved from http://www.museumsoftware.com/previous.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==
PastPerfect operates with four basic [[collection catalog|catalogs]] for sorting collections material. There is the ''archive'' catalog for storing documents, the ''photograph'' catalog for storing photos, tintypes, paintings, etc.; the ''objects'' catalog for storing three-dimensional artifacts, and the ''library'' catalog for storing books that would be included in the institution's library.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, B.S., Whittfield, J.C., Stepansky, A.J. (2012) ''Pastperfect software for museum collections: Version 5 users guide.'' Retrieved from http://museumsoftware.com/v5userguide.html&lt;/ref&gt; Images can be uploaded into the catalog, with multiple photos per record.&lt;ref&gt;Lathrop, S., McDaniel, S.L., &amp; Richey, N. (2010). ''Exposing ourselves: A case study in collection management software implementation.'' Retrieved from http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1352&amp;context=seln&lt;/ref&gt; It also stores donor information, and automatically generates [[Deed of Gift]] forms and thank you letters upon completing certain steps of the accessioning process.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, S. (2007). ''PastPerfect software review. Retrieved from http://ercpierce.blogspot.com/2007/03/pastperfect-software-review.html&lt;/ref&gt; Certain extensions allow for the inclusion of Oral History records and transcripts&lt;ref&gt;Price, S. (n.d.) ''Collection management systems: Tools for managing oral history collections.'' Retrieved from http://ohda.matrix.msu.edu/2012/06/collection-management-systems/&lt;/ref&gt; and there is an additional online function that allows institutions to digitize their collections and make them free to browse on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, B. (n.d.) ''Online collections: Balancing automation and interpretation.'' Retrieved from http://www.slideshare.net/brianlgomez&lt;/ref&gt;

PastPerfect also contains a contact list function, for storing donors, members, and employee contact information in a similar catalog format as the rest of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, B.S., Whittfield, J.C., Stepansky, A.J. (2012) ''Pastperfect software for museum collections: Version 5 users guide.'' Retrieved from http://museumsoftware.com/v5userguide.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Library science|library]] and [[archival science]], '''preservation''' is a set of activities aimed at prolonging the life of a record while making as few changes as possible. Relevant [[metadata]], enhancement of cultural value, and improvement of access are also important aspects of preservation work. Actions taken to influence record creators prior to selection and acquisition must be avoided for proper preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/p/preservation|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=2007-05-11 |publisher=Society of American Archivists|website=www.archivists.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Technical statement|date=September 2018}} Preservation, in this definition, is practiced in a [[library]] or an [[archive]] by a [[librarian]], [[archivist]], or other professional when they perceive a record is in need of care.

Preservation should be distinguished from [[conservation-restoration of cultural heritage]], which refers to the treatment and repair of individual items to slow the process of decay, or restore them to a usable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/c/conservation |title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |accessdate=2007-05-11 |publisher=Society of American Archivists |website=www.archivists.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation is occasionally used interchangeably with preservation, particularly outside the professional literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.spsu.edu/index.php/Preservation_of_Cultural_Artifacts|title=Preservation of Cultural Artifacts|accessdate=2007-05-11|publisher=Southern Polytechnic State University|website=wiki.spsu.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611203338/http://wiki.spsu.edu/index.php/Preservation_of_Cultural_Artifacts|archive-date=2007-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==

===Standard functions of preservation programs===
*[[Collections care]] is the general maintenance and preventive care of a collection as a whole. This can include activities such as [[security]], [[environmental monitoring]], [[preservation surveys]] and more specialized activities such as [[mass deacidification]].
*[[Art conservation|Conservation]] is the treatment and repair of individual items to slow decay or restore them to a usable state. Conservation is occasionally used interchangeably with preservation, particularly outside the professional literature.
*[[Digital preservation]] is the maintenance of digitally stored information. Some means of digital preservation include refreshing, migration, replication and emulation. This should not be confused with [[digitization]], which is a process of creating digital information which must then itself be preserved digitally.
*[[Emergency management|Disaster preparedness]] (RT: Disaster Plan / [[Business continuity planning|Business Continuation]] / [[Disaster Recovery]] / Disaster Mitigation Plan) is the practice of arranging for the necessary resources and planning the best course of action to prevent or minimize damage to a collection in the event of a disaster of any level of magnitude, whether natural or man-made.
*Reformatting is the practice of creating copies of an object in another type of [[data storage device|data-storage device]]. Reformatting processes include [[microform|microfilming]] and digitization.

===Digitization===
{{Main|Digitizing}}

A relatively new concept, [[digitization]], has been hailed as a way to preserve historical items for future use. "Digitizing refers to the process of converting analog materials into digital form."&lt;ref&gt;Oya Y. Rieger, ''Preservation in the Age of Large-Scale Digitization: A White Paper'', (Washington, D.C.: Council on Library and Information Resources, 2008): 10, http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/reports/pub141/pub141.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919051600/http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/reports/pub141/pub141.pdf |date=2015-09-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For manuscripts, digitization is achieved through scanning an item and saving it to a digital format. For example, the Google Book Search program has partnered with over forty libraries around the world to digitize books. The goal of this library partnership project is to "make it easier for people to find relevant books – specifically, books they wouldn't find any other way such as those that are out of print – while carefully respecting authors' and publishers' copyrights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/googlebooks/library/|title=Google Books Library Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although digitization seems to be a promising area for future preservation, there are also problems. The main problems are that digital space costs money, formats change, and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;Rieger, 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-quality images take a longer time to scan, but are often more valuable for future use. Fragile items are often more difficult or more expensive to scan, which creates a selection problem for preservationists. Other problems include scan quality, redundancy of digitized books among different libraries, and copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;Rieger, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these problems are being solved through educational initiatives. Educational programs are tailoring themselves to fit preservation needs and help new students understand preservation practices. Programs teaching graduate students about digital librarianship are especially important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conway|first1=Paul|year=2010|title=Preservation in the Age of Google: Digitization, Digital Preservation, and Dilemmas|url=|journal=Library Quarterly|volume=80|issue=1|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as the Digital Preservation Network strive to ensure that "the complete scholarly record is preserved for future generations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpn.org/|title=Digital Preservation Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress maintains a Sustainability of Digital Formats web site that educates institutions on various aspects of preservation: most notably, on approximately 200 digital format types and which are most likely to last into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/intro/format_eval_rel.shtml|title=Library of Congress: Sustainability of Digital Formats&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital preservation|Digital Preservation]] is another name for digitization, and is the term more commonly used in archival courses. The main goal of digital preservation is to guarantee that people will have access to the digitally preserved materials long into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preserv/defdigpres0408|title=Definitions of Digital Preservation|last=admin|date=2008-02-21|work=Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services (ALCTS)|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
When practicing preservation one has several factors to consider to properly preserve a record: 1) the environment the record is store in, 2) the criteria to determine when preservation is necessary, 3) what standard practices will be laid down for preservation in an individual institution, 4) research and testing, and 5) vendor services needed for preservation. 

===Storage environment===
Environmental controls are necessary to facilitate the preservation of organic materials and are especially important to monitor in rare and [[special collections]]. Key environmental factors to watch include [[temperature]], [[relative humidity]], pests, pollutants, and [[light]] exposure.

In general, the lower the temperature is, the better it is for the collection. However, since books and other materials are often housed in areas with people, a compromise must be struck to accommodate human comfort. A reasonable temperature to accomplish both goals is 65-68˚F however, if possible, film and photography collections should be kept in a segregated area at 55˚F.&lt;ref&gt;Lull, W.P. (1990). ''Conservation environment guidelines for libraries and archives; with the assistance of Paul N. Banks.'' Albany, NY:  The University of the State of New York, The State Education Dept., The New York State Library, Division of Library Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books and other materials take up and give off moisture making them sensitive to relative humidity. Very high humidity encourages mold growth and insect infestations. Low humidity causes materials to lose their flexibility. Fluctuations in relative humidity are more damaging than a constant humidity in the middle or low range. Generally, the relative humidity should be between 30-50% with as little variation as possible, however recommendations on specific levels to maintain vary depending on the type of material, i.e. paper-based, film, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/2The_Environment/01BasicGuidelines.php|title=Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=2007-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212193142/http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/2The_Environment/01BasicGuidelines.php|archive-date=2007-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A specialized dew point calculator for book preservation is available.&lt;ref&gt;"Dew Point Calculator." Image Permanence Institute. Retrieved May 16, 2011 from http://www.dpcalc.org/
&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Pests, such as insects and vermin, eat and destroy paper and the adhesive that secures book bindings. Food and drink in libraries, archives, and museums can increase the attraction of pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/preservation/libeat.html# |title=UCSD Libraries Preservation Department. "Why is Eating and Drinking in the Library Discouraged?" 2006. UCSD. 18 June 2008 |access-date=2008-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830091329/http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/preservation/libeat.html# |archive-date=2006-08-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Integrated Pest Management]] system is one way to control pests in libraries.

Particulate and gaseous pollutants, such as soot, [[ozone]], [[sulfur dioxide]], oxides of nitrogen, can cause dust, soiling, and irreversible molecular damage to materials. Pollutants are exceedingly small and not easily detectable or removable. A special filtration system in the building's [[HVAC]] is a helpful defense.

Exposure to light also has a significant effect on materials. It is not only the light visible to humans that can cause damage, but also [[ultraviolet]] light and [[infrared]] radiation. Measured in [[lux]] or the amount of lumens/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the generally accepted level of illumination with sensitive materials is limited to 50 lux per day. Materials receiving more lux than recommended can be placed in dark storage periodically to prolong the original appearance of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, G. ''The Museum Environment''. 2nd ed. London: Butterworths, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent concerns about the impact of climate change on the management of cultural heritage objects as well as the historic environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/2082/ |title=Climate change and the historic environment |publisher=Centre for Sustainable Heritage, University College London |accessdate=2008-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504150330/http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/2082/ |archive-date=2008-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has prompted research efforts to investigate alternative climate control methods and strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/22_1/index.html|title=From the Outside in: Preventive conservation, sustainability, and environmental conservation|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that include the implementation of alternative climate control systems to replace or supplement traditional high-energy consuming HVAC systems as well as the introduction of passive preservation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/22_1/index.html|title=Collections care, human comfort, and climate control: A case study at the Casa de Rui Barbosa Museum|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than maintaining a flat line, consistent 24/7 condition for a collection's environment, fluctuation can occur within acceptable limits to create a preservation environment while also thinking of energy efficiency and taking advantage of the outside environment.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Herzog, "Energy Savings and Collection Management," Accessed on May 16, 2011, https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/resources/newsletter-archive/v2/energy-savings&lt;/ref&gt;

Bound materials are sensitive to rapid temperature or humidity cycling due to differential expansion of the binding and pages, which may cause the binding to crack and/or the pages to warp. Changes in temperature and humidity should be done slowly so as to minimize the difference in expansion rates. However, an accelerated aging study on the effects of fluctuating temperature and humidity on paper color and strength showed no evidence that cycling of one temperature to another or one RH to another caused a different mechanism of decay.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Louis Bigourdan and James M. Reilly. "Effects of Fluctuating Environments on Paper Materials--Stability and Practical Significance for Preservation." Accessed on May 16, 2011 https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/305&lt;/ref&gt;

Contamination can occur at the time of manufacture, especially with electronic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/preservation-conservation-restoration-whats-the-difference/|title=Preservation, Conservation, Restoration: What’s the Difference? {{!}} Computer History Museum|website=www.computerhistory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be stopped before it spreads, but it is usually irreversible.[[File:"Banana Book".jpg|thumb|The Flickr user describes an incident of putting a banana stained book in their backpack and leaving it for a couple weeks with this result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/vblibrary/5334339828|title=Banana Book|work=Flickr|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Preservation criteria===
Making a proper decision is an important factor before starting preservation practices. [[Decision making]] for preservation should be made considering significance and value of materials. Significance is considered to have two major components: importance and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/pdfs/Significance_cons.pdf|title=A Significance Recognition Scheme for Non-National Museums and Galleries in Scotland|publisher=Scottish Museums Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106213355/http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/pdfs/Significance_cons.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=2007-11-06|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Importance" relates to the collection's role as a record, and "quality" covers comprehensiveness, depth, uniqueness, authenticity and reputation of the collection. Moreover, analyzing the significance of materials can be used to uncover more about their meaning.&lt;ref name="A Regional Approach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natlib.govt.nz/catalogues/library-documents/identifying-items-of-national-significance|title=A Regional Approach to Identifying Items of National Significance Held by Small Cultural Institutions in New Zealand|last=Dorner|first=Daniel|last2=Young|first2=Sophie|publication-date=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328010251/http://www.natlib.govt.nz/catalogues/library-documents/identifying-items-of-national-significance|archivedate=2007-03-28|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment of significance can also aid in documenting the provenance and context to argue the case for grant funding for the object and collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/sector_info_item/5|title=Significance - A Guide to Assessing the Significance of Cultural Heritage Objects and Collections|publisher=Heritage Collections Council (Australia)|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of significance can be historically, culturally, socially, or spiritually significant. In the preservation context, libraries and archives make decisions in different ways. In libraries, decision-making likely targets existing holding materials, whereas in archives, decisions for preservation are often made when they acquire materials. Therefore, different criteria might be needed on different occasions. In general, for archive criteria, the points include:

# the characteristics of a record (purpose, creator, etc.);
# the quality of the information in the record;
# the record in context (part of a series or not);
# potential use and possible limitations; and
# the cost against the benefits from its existence.&lt;ref name="A Regional Approach" /&gt; 

[[File:Old book bindings.jpg|thumb|Worn books at the library of [[Merton College]], Oxford.|300x300px]]For archival criteria, the following are evidence of significance:

# uniqueness,
# irreplaceability,
# high level of impact – over time or place,
# high level of influence,
# representation of a type, and
# comparative value (rarity, completeness, integrity relative to others of its kind).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pymm|first=Bob|year=2006|title=Building Collections for All Time: the Issue of Significance|journal=AARL (Australian Academic Research Libraries)|volume=37|issue=1|pages=61–73|doi=10.1080/00048623.2006.10755323|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards===
Since the 1970s, the [[Northeast Document Conservation Center]] has stated that the study of understanding the needs of the archive/library is inherently important to the survival of archives and libraries. In order for the preservation of a collection to survive for a long time it is important that a systematic preservation plan is in place. The first step in planning a preservation program is to assess the institution's existing preservation needs. This process entails identifying the general and specific needs of the collection, establishing priorities, and gathering the resources to execute the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patkus|first=Beth|title=Assessing Preservation Needs, A Self-Survey Guide|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|publication-place=Andover|publication-date=2003|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because budget and time limitations require priorities to be set, standards have been established by the profession to determine what should be preserved in a collection.  Considerations include existing condition, rarity, and evidentiary and market values.  With non-paper formats, the availability of equipment to access the information will be a factor (for example, playback equipment for audio-visual materials, or microform readers).  An institution should determine how many, if any, other repositories hold the material, and consider coordinating efforts with those that do.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub103abst.html|title=The Evidence in Hand: Report of the Task Force on the Artifact in Library Collections|last=Nichols|first=Stephen G.|last2=Smith|first2=Abby|publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources|year=2001|isbn=1-887334-88-2|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|publication-date=2001|oclc=48623491|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions should establish an environment conducive to preservation changes, involve staff, and create an understanding among administration and staff. The first steps an institution should implement, according to the NEDCC, are to establish a policy that defines and charts the course of action and create a framework for carrying out goals and priorities.

There are three methods for carrying out a preservation survey: general preservation assessment, collection condition surveys, and an item-by-item survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Graham|title=Surveying Collections: The importance of Condition Assessment for Preservation Management|publisher=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science 27, no. 4|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|publication-date=1995|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; General condition surveys can be part of a library [[inventory (library)|inventory]].

Selection for treatment determines the survival of materials and should be done by a specialist, whether in relation to an established collection development policy or on an item by item basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preservation: Issues and Planning |last=Harris |first=Carolyn |publisher=American Library Association |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-585-37626-4 &lt;!-- |ISBN=0-585-37626-3 --&gt;|editor-last=Banks |editor-first=Paul N. |place=Chicago |pages=206–224 |contribution=Selection for Preservation |oclc=48139650 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author-link=Carolyn_Harris |editor2-last=Pilette |editor2-first=Roberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an object or collection has been chosen for preservation, the treatment must be determined that is most appropriate to the material and its repository. If the information is most important, reformatting or creation of a surrogate is a likely option. If the artifact itself is of value, it will receive conservation treatment, ideally of a reversible nature.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

===Research and testing===
With old media deteriorating or showing their vulnerabilities and new media becoming available, research remains active in the field of conservation and preservation. Everything from how to preserve paper media to creating and maintaining electronic resources and gauging their [[digital permanence]] is being explored by students and professionals in archives/libraries. The two main issues that most institutions tend to face are the rapid disintegration of acidic paper and water damage (due to flooding, plumbing problems, etc.). Therefore, these areas of preservation, as well as new digital technologies, receive much of the research attention.

The [[American Library Association]] has many scholarly journals that publish articles on preservation topics, such as ''College and Research Libraries, Information Technology and Libraries,'' and ''Library Resources and Technical Services''. Scholarly periodicals in this field from other publishers include ''International Preservation News, Journal of the American Institute for Conservation'', and ''Collection Management'' among many others.

===Vendor services===
Many private entities provide preservation and conservation services and supplies. One of the most well known companies in preservation is Hollinger Metal Edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollingermetaledge.com/|title=Hollinger Metal Edge - Since 1945!|website=www.hollingermetaledge.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sell [[Hollinger box]]es, folders, AV preservation tools, archival paper, exhibit material, and even furniture. Another company that produces many preservation tools is University Products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityproducts.com/|title=University Products - Thinking in and out of the box since 1968.|website=www.universityproducts.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Globalize section|date=May 2018}}

Learning the proper methods of preservation is important and most archivists are educated on the subject at academic institutions that specifically cover archives and preservation. In the United States most repositories require archivists to have a degree from an ALA-accredited library school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-preservation-rankings|title=Best Archives and Preservation Programs|last=|first=|date=2017|website=US News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar institutions exist in countries outside the US.

Since 2010, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has enhanced funding for library and archives conservation education in three major conservation programs.&lt;ref&gt;https://mellon.org/programs/scholarly-communications/preservation-and-conservation/&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are all part of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~anagpic/|title=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property|publisher=University of Texas School of Information|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another educational resource available to preservationists is the Northeast Document Conservation Center or  NEDCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/home.php|title=NEDCC|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Preservation, Planning and Publications Committee of the Preservation and Reformatting Section (PARS) in the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services has created a Preservation Education Directory of ALA Accredited schools in the U.S. and Canada offering courses in preservation. The directory is updated approximately every three years. The 10th Edition was made available on the ALCTS web site in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preservation/educationdirectory|title=Preservation Education Directory 10th Edition|publisher=ALCTS|accessdate=2015-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Information science}}Additional preservation education is available to librarians through various professional organizations, such as:

==Preservation in non-academic facilities==

===Public libraries===
Limited, tax-driven funding can often interfere with the ability for public libraries to engage in extensive preservation activities. Materials, particularly books, are often much easier to replace than to repair when damaged or worn. Public libraries usually try to tailor their services to meet the needs and desires of their local communities, which could cause an emphasis on acquiring new materials over preserving old ones. Librarians working in public facilities frequently have to make complicated decisions about how to best serve their patrons. Commonly, public library systems work  with each other and sometimes with more academic libraries through interlibrary loan programs. By sharing resources, they are able to expand upon what might be available to their own patrons and share the burdens of preservation across a greater array of systems.

===Archival repositories and special collections===
Archival facilities focus specifically on rare and fragile materials. With staff trained in appropriate techniques, archives are often available to many public and private library facilities as an alternative to destroying older materials. Items that are unique, such as photographs, or items that are out of print, can be preserved in archival facilities more easily than in many library settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|website=www.clir.org|publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums===
Because so many museum holdings are unique, including print materials, art, and other objects, preservationists are often most active in this setting; however, since most holdings are usually much more fragile, or possibly corrupted, [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] may be more necessary than preservation. This is especially common in [[Art museum|art museums]]. Museums typically hold to the same practices lead by archival institutions.

==History==

===Antecedents===
Preservation as a formal profession in libraries and archives dates from the twentieth century, but its philosophy and practice has roots in many earlier traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary Lynn |last=Ritzenthaler |year=1993 |title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts |chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |location=Chicago |publisher=Society of American Archivists |url= |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ancient societies, appeals to heavenly protectors were used to preserve books, scrolls and manuscripts from insects, fire and decay. 
* To the ancient Egyptians, the scarab or dung beetle (see: [[Scarab (artifact)]]) was a protector of written products. 
* In ancient [[Babylon]], [[Nabu]] is the heavenly patron of books and protector of clay tablets. Nabu is the Babylonian god of wisdom and writing, and is the patron of the scribes, librarians and archivists. 
* In Arabic and other eastern societies, sometimes a traditional method to protect books and scrolls was a metaphysical appeal to "Kabi:Kaj", the "King of the Cockroaches".&lt;ref&gt;Gacek, Adam. "The Use of Kabikaj in Arabic Manuscripts." Manuscripts of the Middle East. Volume I, 1986. Page 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are three saints in the Christian church that are closely associated with libraries as patrons: [[Saint Lawrence]], [[Saint Jerome]]&lt;ref&gt;Kaschins, Elizabeth and Jane Kemp. "Saint Jerome, the Patron Saint of Librarians." Library Journal. September 1, 1988, pages 135-136.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Saint Catharine of Alexandria or [[Catherine of Alexandria]].
* In some Christian monasteries, prayers and curses were placed at the end of books to prevent theft, or to damn the thieves. Frequently called a "[[book curse]]", these were placed in the book to deter theft. 
* The ancient Chinese god Wei T'O is the patron god of libraries and books. Many examples of appeals to Wei T'O can be found in Chinese manuscripts dated five hundred or more years ago. &lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.weito.com/ accessed July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wei T'O is especially invoked for the protection of books and libraries against fire. Since the modern books are suffering from acid decomposition ([[slow fires]]), Wei T'O is especially relevant to modern librarianship. A modern product to de-acidify paper is named in his honor.
* Sri Lankan symbols or images of the Sinhalese "Fire Demons" are hung in the corners of libraries and other buildings to appease the incendiary demons and to avert fire, lightning and cataclysm, according to Sinhalese mythology. Since fire and acid decomposition (also known as "slow fires") are a special problem for libraries because of the concentration of paper products, the "Fire Demons" are also included when used to assuage these destroyers of libraries and books.
* The Aztec and Mayan Indians of Latin America also had deities concerned with libraries. The major god, [[Quetzalcoatl]], is credited with the discoveries of the arts, the calendar, and of writing. A single feather or plume at the beginning or at the end of a document or stone carving would indicate a dedication to the "Feathered Serpent." This symbol degenerated over time to a single fringed line.
Human record-keeping arguably dates back to the [[cave painting]] boom of the [[upper paleolithic]], some 32,000-40,000 years ago. More direct antecedents are the [[History of writing|writing systems]] that developed in the 4th millennium B.C. Written record keeping and information sharing practices, along with [[oral tradition]], sustain and transmit information from one group to another. This level of preservation has been supplemented over the last century with the professional practice of preservation and conservation in the cultural heritage community.

#[[Oral tradition]] or [[oral culture]], the transmission of information from one generation to the next without a writing system.
#Antiquarian practices, including [[Scribe|scribal practice]], [[Burial| burial practice]], the libraries at [[Library of Pergamum|Pergamum]], [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandria]] and other ancient archives.
#Medieval practices, including the [[scriptorium]] and [[relic]] collection
#[[Renaissance]] and the changing conception of artists and works of art
#[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[Encyclopedists]]
#[[Romanticism|Romantic movement]]'s imperative to preserve

===Significant events===
*1933: [[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] introduces the field of conservation to paper deacidification when he publishes a paper on the [[acid paper]] problem. In later studies, Barrow tested paper from American books made between 1900 and 1949, and learned that after forty years the books had lost on average 96 percent of their original strength; after less than ten years, they had already lost 64 percent. Barrow determined that this rapid deterioration was not the direct result of using wood-pulp fibers, since rag papers of this period were also aging rapidly, but rather due to the residual [[sulfuric acid]] produced in both [[Cotton paper|rag]] and wood pulp papers. Manufacturing methods used after 1870 employed sulfuric acid for [[sizing]] and bleaching the paper. Earlier papermaking methods left the final product only mildly alkaline or even neutral.  Such paper has maintained its strength for 300 to 800 years, despite [[sulfur dioxide]] and other air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stevens |first=Rolland E. |date=October 1968 |title=The Library |journal=The Journal of Higher Education |pages=407–409|doi=10.2307/1980093 |volume=39 |issue=7 |jstor=1980093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrow's 1933 article on the fragile state of wood pulp paper predicted the life expectancy, or "LE", of this paper was approximately 40–50 years. At that point the paper would begin to show signs of natural decay, and he concluded that research for a new media on which to write and print was needed.
*1966: [[The Flood of the River Arno in Florence, Italy]] damaged or destroyed millions of rare books and led to the development of restoration laboratories and new methods in conservation. Instrumental in this process was conservationist [[Peter Waters]], who led a group of volunteers, called "mud angels", in restoring thousands of books and papers. This event awakened many historians, librarians, and other professionals to the importance of having a preservation plan. Many consider this flood to be one of the worst disasters since the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|burning of the Library of Alexandria]]. It spurred a resurgence in the profession of preservation and conservation worldwide.
*1987: Terry Saunders releases the film [[Slow fire|Slow Fires: On the Preservation of the Human Record]] which examines paper embrittlement resulting from acid decay
*1989: March 7 ["[[Commitment Day]]"] Major US print publishers convene at NYPL to endorse a community-wide commitment to utilizing [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 9706 certified permanent durable paper in order to combat the acid paper epidemic.

===Significant people===
*[[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] (1904–1967) was an American chemist and paper conservator, and a pioneer of library and archives conservation. He introduced the field of conservation to paper deacidification through alkalization.
*[[Paul N. Banks]] (1934–2000) was Conservator and Head of the Conservation Department at the [[Newberry Library]] from 1964 to 1981, and published regularly on [[bookbinding]], [[book and paper conservation]], and problems related to conservation.  He designed and implemented a curriculum for [[Columbia University|Columbia University's]] School of Library Science that dealt directly with preservation training.
*[[Pamela Darling]], author and historian, was Preservation Specialist for the [[Association of Research Libraries]]. Her works include materials to aid libraries in establishing their own comprehensive preservation programs.
*[[Carolyn Harris (librarian)|Carolyn Harris]] worked as head of Columbia University Libraries' Preservation Division from 1981 until 1987, where she worked closely with Paul Banks. She published extensive research throughout her career, especially dealing with [[mass deacidification]] of wood-pulp paper.
*[[Peter Waters]], former Conservation Officer at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, worked in the areas of disaster recovery and preparedness, and the salvaging of water-damaged paper goods.
*[[Nicholson Baker]] is a contemporary American novelist and author of ''[[Double Fold]]'', a criticism of libraries' destruction of paper-based media.
*[[Patricia Battin]], as the first president of the Commission on Preservation and Access, worked to organize a national campaign both for the use of alkaline paper in publishing companies and for a national program of preservation [[microform|microfilming]].
*John F. Dean, Preservation and Conservation Librarian at Cornell University, has made contributions towards improving [[Book preservation in developing countries|preservation efforts in developing countries]]. Specifically, Dean has created online tutorials for library conservation and preservation in Southeast Asia and Iraq and the Middle East.

The [[Paul Banks and Carolyn Harris Preservation Award]] for outstanding preservation specialists in library and archival science, is given annually by the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/alcts/alcts.cfm Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214195255/http://www.ala.org/ala/alcts/alcts.cfm |date=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subdivision of the [[American Library Association]]. It is awarded in recognition of professional preservation specialists who have made significant contributions to the field.

==Legal &amp; Ethical Issues==
Reformatting, or in any other way copying an item's contents, raises obvious [[copyright]] issues. In many cases, a library is allowed to make a limited number of copies of an item for preservation purposes. In the United States, certain exceptions have been made for libraries and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108- |title=U.S. Code: Title 17,108. Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives |accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=Legal Information Institute |website=www.law.cornell.edu]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics will play an important role in many aspects of the conservator's activities. When choosing which objects are in need of treatment, the conservator should do what is best for the object in question and not yield to pressure or opinion from outside sources. Conservators should refer to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice,&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aic.stanford.edu/pubs/ethics.html|title=AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304161903/http://aic.stanford.edu/pubs/ethics.html|archivedate=March 4, 2000|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that the conservation professional must "strive to attain the highest possible standards in all aspects of conservation."

One instance in which these decisions may get tricky is when the conservator is dealing with cultural objects. The AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt; has addressed such concerns, stating "All actions of the conservation professional must be governed by an informed respect for cultural property, its unique character and significance and the people or person who created it." This can be applied in both the care and long-term storage of objects in archives and institutions.

It is important that preservation specialists to be respectful of cultural property and the societies that created it, it is also important for them to be aware of international and national laws pertaining to stolen items. In recent years there has been a rise in nations seeking out artifacts that have been stolen and are now in museums. In many cases museums are working with the nations to find a compromise to balance the need for reliable supervision as well as access for both the public and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;"Rightful Owners." ''Nature'', Vol. 440 (6) 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservators are not just bound by ethics to treat cultural and religious objects with respect, but also in some cases by law. For example, in the United States, conservators must comply with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act ([[NAGPRA]]). The [http://www.firstarchivistscircle.org/ First Archivists Circle], a group of Native American archivists, has also created [http://www2.nau.edu/libnap-p/index.html Protocols for Native American Archival Materials]. The non-binding guidelines are suggestions for libraries and archives with Native American archival materials.

The care of cultural and sacred objects often affects the physical storage or the object. For example, sacred objects of the native peoples of the Western United States are supposed to be stored with sage to ensure their spiritual well being. The idea of storing an object with plant material is inherently problematic to an archival collection because of the possibility of insect infestation. When conservators have faced this problem, they have addressed it by using freeze-dried sage, thereby meeting both conservation and cultural needs.

Some individuals in the archival community have explored the possible moral responsibility to preserve all cultural phenomena, in regards to the concept of monumental preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Cloonan, Michele V. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1387/is_3_55/ai_n19311179 "The Moral Imperative to Preserve"], "[[Library Trends]]", Winter 2007. Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other advocates argue that such an undertaking is something that the indigenous or native communities that produce such cultural objects are better suited to perform. Currently, however, many indigenous communities are not financially able to support their own archives and museums. Still, indigenous archives are on the rise in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Amy|year=2002|title=Issues in Native American Archives|url=|journal=Collection Management|volume=27|issue=2|pages=43–54|doi=10.1300/j105v27n02_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There is a longstanding tension between preservation of and access to library materials, particularly in the area of [[special collections]]. Handling materials promotes their progression to an unusable state, especially if they are handled carelessly. On the other hand, materials must be used in order to gain any benefit from them. In a collection with valuable materials, this conflict is often resolved by a number of measures which can include heightened security, requiring the use of gloves for photographs, restricting the materials researchers may bring with them into a reading room, and restricting use of materials to patrons who are not able to satisfy their research needs with less valuable copies of an item. These restrictions are annoyances to researchers who feel that these measures are in place solely to keep materials out of the hands of the public.

There is also controversy surrounding preservation methods. A major controversy at the end of the twentieth century centered on the practice of discarding items that had been microfilmed. This was the subject of novelist [[Nicholson Baker]]'s book ''Double Fold'', which chronicled his efforts to save many old runs of American newspapers (formerly owned by the British Library) from being sold to dealers or pulped. A similar concern persists over the retention of original documents reformatted by any means, analog or digital. Concerns include scholarly needs and legal requirements for authentic or original records as well as questions about the longevity, quality and completeness of reformatted materials.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert B. Townsend, {{cite web |url=http://blog.historians.org/articles/204/google-books-whats-not-to-like |title=Google Books: What’s Not to Like? |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=American Historical Association |website=www.historians.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Paul Duguid, {{cite web |url=http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_8/duguid/ |title=Inheritance and loss? A brief survey of Google Books |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=First Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retention of originals as a source or fail-safe copy is now a fairly common practice. Another controversy revolving around different preservation methods is that of digitization of original material to maintain the intellectual content of the material while ignoring the physical nature of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle, G.T. (1998). Texts and artifacts in the electronic era. 21stC, 3.2. 
[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-3.2/tanselle.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Modern Language Association]]'s Committee on the Future of the Print Record structured its "Statement on the Significance of Primary Records" on the inherent theoretical ideology that there is a need to preserve as many copies of a printed edition as is possible as texts and their textual settings are, quite simply, not separable, just as the artifactual characteristics of texts are as relevant and varied as the texts themselves (in the report mentioned herewith, [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] suggests that presently existing book stacks need not be abandoned with emerging technologies; rather they serve as vitally important original (primary) sources for future study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records|title=Statement on the Significance of Primary Records|accessdate=2008-07-27|publisher=Modern Language Association|website=www.mla.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701014009/http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records|archive-date=2008-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many digitized items, such as back issues of periodicals, are provided by publishers and databases on a subscription basis. If these companies were to cease providing access to their digital information, facilities that elected to discard paper copies of these periodicals could face significant difficulties in providing access to these items. Discussion as to the best ways to utilize digital technologies is therefore ongoing, and the practice continues to evolve. Of course, the issues surrounding digital objects and their care in libraries and archives continues to expand as more and more of contemporary culture is created, stored, and used digitally. These [[born-digital]] materials raise their own new kinds of preservation challenges and in some cases they may even require use new kinds of tools and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Ross |first =Seamus |last2 =Gow |first2 =Ann |publication-date = 1999 |title = Digital archaeology?

===The library as a sacred institution===
In her book "Sacred Stacks: The Higher Purpose of Libraries and Librarianship", Nancy Kalikow Maxwell discusses how libraries are capable of performing some of the same functions as religion.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Stacks: The Higher Purpose of Libraries and Librarianship|last=Maxwell|first=Nancy Kalikow|publisher=American Library Association|year=2006|isbn=0-8389-0917-5|place=Chicago|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many librarians feel that their work is done for some higher purpose.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt;  The same can be said for preservation librarians. One instance of the library's role as sacred is to provide a sense of [[immortality]]: with the ever-changing world outside, the library will remain stable and dependable.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt; Preservation is a great help in this regard. Through digitization and reformatting, preservation librarians are able to retain material while at the same time adapting to new methods. In this way, libraries can adapt to the changes in user needs without changing the quality of the material itself. Through preservation efforts, patrons can rest assured that although materials are constantly deteriorating over time, the library itself will remain a stable, reliable environment for their information needs. Another sacred ability of the library is to provide information and a connection to the past.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt; By working to slow down the processes of deterioration and decay of library materials, preservation practices help keep this link to the past alive.

'''''Sleeping Beauty''''' is a 2011 Australian [[erotic]] [[drama film]] that was written and directed by [[Julia Leigh]]. It is her debut as a director.&lt;ref name=saf/&gt; The film stars [[Emily Browning]] as a young university student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sleeping-beauty-julia-leigh-101-mins-18-2371150.html |title=Sleeping Beauty, Julia Leigh, 101 mins (18) |publisher=Independent |date=11 June 2017 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She takes up a part-time high-paying job with a mysterious group that caters to rich men who like the company of nude sleeping young women. Lucy is required to sleep alongside paying customers and be absolutely submissive to their erotic desires, fulfilling their fantasies by voluntarily entering into physical unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/16/sleeping-beauty-julia-leigh-review |title=Sleeping Beauty – review |publisher=BBC News |date=11 June 2017 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is based on influences that include Leigh's own dream experiences, and the novels ''[[The House of the Sleeping Beauties]]'' and ''[[Memories of My Melancholy Whores]]'' by [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureates]] [[Yasunari Kawabata]] and  [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]], respectively.&lt;ref name="leigh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/news/2011/11/sleeping-beauty-writerdirector-julia-leigh/|work=Filmmaker Magazine|date=30 November 2011|accessdate=5 April 2012|title="Sleeping Beauty" writer/director Julia Leigh|author=Macauly, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = LimNYT_15May11&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lim, Dennis | date = 15 June 2011 | title = ArtsBeat: Cannes Q. and A.: Julia Leigh on a Modern-Day ‘Sleeping Beauty’ | journal = [[The New York Times]] | format = NYT arts blogpost | url = http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/cannes-qa-julia-leigh-on-a-modern-day-sleeping-beauty/ | access-date=10 June 2016 | quote = "The Australian novelist-turned-director Julia Leigh traces the origins of her first feature, "Sleeping Beauty," to what she calls a bout of 'self-exposure.' The attention she received for her well-received first novel, 'The Hunter' (1999), led to a recurring nightmare about being watched in her sleep." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film premiered in May at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] as the first Competition entry to be screened. It was the first Australian film In Competition at Cannes since ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001). ''Sleeping Beauty'' was released in Australia on 23 June 2011. It premiered in US cinemas on 2 December 2011 on [[limited release]]. Overall critical reception of the film has been mixed, rising to some approval through June 2016, after circulation of the film on the festival circuit; audience reception, on the other hand, has been weak (less than a third of a sample of tens of thousands approving).&lt;ref name=rottentomatoes&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/771239978/ | title=Sleeping Beauty [2 December 2011] | author= RottenTomatoes Staff | date = 10 June 2016 | work=rottentomatoes.com | access-date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metacritic&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sleeping-beauty | title=Sleeping Beauty [2 December 2011] | author= Metacritic Staff | date = 10 June 2016 | work=metacritic.com | access-date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

Lucy ([[Emily Browning]]) is a university student who works in an office in the daytime and at a restaurant in the evenings. She is occasionally a research subject at a science laboratory.&lt;ref name="NYtimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/movies/julia-leighs-sleeping-beauty-review.html |title=Objectification Is Also in the Eye of the Beheld |publisher=NY Times News |date=12 June 2017 |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucy is paying tuition and rent by doing several jobs. She is caring for a sick relative, Birdmann ([[Ewen Leslie]]) who is very attracted to her. While she does not return his sexual interest, Lucy enjoys Birdmann's company, and in his presence is the only time she is shown smiling or laughing. An old joke between the two is that Birdmann frequently asked Lucy to marry him; Lucy always says no. Due to lack of money and Birdmann's bad health, Lucy makes a decision to look for another part-time job.&lt;ref name="Screenrush"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://screencrush.com/reel-women-sleeping-beauty |title=REEL WOMEN: ‘SLEEPING BEAUTY’ |publisher=screencrush.com |date=12 June 2017|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a classified ad for yet another short-term job, Lucy meets Clara ([[Rachael Blake]]), who runs a service that combines [[lingerie]] [[Model (person)|modelling]] and [[catering]] performed by young women at a black tie dinner party for male clients. Clara assures her that the men are not allowed to touch the women sexually, and Lucy agrees to try it. Clara inspects Lucy's body and names her "Sara" for the purpose of anonymity. At the dinner party, Lucy is the only girl dressed in white; the other women wear black lingerie that is much more revealing than Lucy's costume.&lt;ref name="NYtimes.com"/&gt;

After one other session as a serving girl, Lucy gets promoted. She receives a call from Clara's assistant, Tom (Eden Falk), for a different request. Lucy is driven to a country mansion, where Clara offers Lucy a new role wherein she will be voluntarily sedated and sleep naked while male clients lie beside her. They are permitted to caress and cuddle her, but penetration is not allowed.&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/6573 |title=A young woman sells her sleeping body for sex in Australian novelist Julia Leigh’s first film. |publisher=BFI |date=12 June 2017 |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Lucy falls asleep, she lies unconscious on the bed and Clara leads in her client. After Clara reminds the man of the no-penetration rule, he strips and curls up beside Lucy.&lt;ref name="Tandfonline"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17503175.2014.905050?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=rsau20 |title=Surrendering expectations of the girl in Julia Leigh's Sleeping Beauty |publisher=Tandfonline |date=12 June 2017 |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few of these sessions, Lucy has enough money to move into a larger, more expensive apartment, where she lives alone. She receives a call from Birdmann, who has overdosed on [[painkillers]]. She goes to his house and finds him dying in his bed. Sobbing, she takes off her shirt and gets in bed with him, but he dies in her arms. At Birdmann's funeral, Lucy abruptly asks an old friend if he will marry her, in an echo of Birdmann's old playful banter. The friend, however, not understanding the reference, takes her seriously and, shocked, refuses her, citing a number of Lucy's personal problems as his reasons.&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/culture/film-review-sleeping-beauty/417738.article |title=Sleeping Beauty |publisher=Times Higher |date=12 June 2017|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At her next assignment with Clara, Lucy asks if she can see what happens during the sessions while she is asleep. Clara refuses, saying it will put her clients at risk of blackmail. Lucy decides to surreptitiously film her next encounter. The client is once again the first man, but this time, he also drinks the tea with a [[Drug overdose|much larger dose]] of the sleeping drug.&lt;ref name="collider.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://collider.com/sleeping-beauty-julia-leigh-review |title=TIFF 2011: SLEEPING BEAUTY |publisher=Collider |date=12 June 2017|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning, Clara comes in and checks the man's pulse, showing no surprise when he cannot be awakened. Clara tries to wake Lucy, who has overdosed as well, and is eventually able to revive her using [[Artificial respiration|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. Lucy begins screaming when she sees the dead man in bed next to her.&lt;ref name="collider.com"/&gt;

The film ends with the scene captured by the hidden camera: the dead old man and the sleeping girl both lying peacefully together in bed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9258">In [[linguistics]], '''verb-framing''' and '''satellite-framing''' are typological descriptions of a way that verb phrases in a [[language]] can describe the ''path'' of motion or the ''manner'' of motion, respectively.  Some languages use it and others do not.

== Manner and path ==
The manner of motion refers to a type of distinct motion described by a particular verb: running, tumbling, sliding, walking, crawling, etc. The path of motion refers to the direction of the movement: movement into, out of, across, etc.  The two concepts can be encoded in the verb as part of its root meaning or in a separate particle associated to the verb (a ''satellite''). Manner may also not be expressed at all.

Languages are considered ''verb-framed'' or ''satellite-framed'' based on how the motion path is encoded. [[English language|English]] verbs use [[grammatical particle|particles]] to show the path of motion ("run into", "go out", "fall down"&lt;ref&gt;The particles 'into', 'out' and 'down' differ in usage from the same words employed as [[prepositions]] because they indicate direction of movement as an attribute of the motion, without specifying location. Together with the verb, they form a [[phrasal verb]]. When the same word is linked to a specified location (such as 'run ''into'' the garden', 'go ''out'' of the house', 'fall ''down'' the hole'), it is a [[preposition]] introducing a prepositional phrase.&lt;/ref&gt;), and its verbs usually show manner of motion; thus, English is a satellite-framed language. English verbs that are exceptions are mostly derived from [[Latin]], such as "exit", "ascend", or "enter".

All [[Germanic languages]] are satellite-framed languages. Accordingly, "to go out" is ''hinausgehen'' in [[German language|German]], ''uitgaan'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and ''gå ut'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], wherein ''gehen'' / ''gaan'' / ''gå'' are equivalents of "to go", and ''hinaus'' / ''uit'' / ''ut'' are equivalents of "out". In this manner, Germanic languages can form all kinds of compounds, even less manifest ones like (German) ''hinaustanzen'' "to dance out" and so on.

On the other hand, all [[Romance language]]s are verb-framed. [[Spanish language|Spanish]], for example, makes heavy use of verbs of motion like ''entrar'', ''salir'', ''subir'', ''bajar'' ("go in", "go out", "go up", "go down"), which directly encode motion path, and may leave out the manner of motion or express it in a complement of manner (typically a [[participle]]): ''entró corriendo'' "he ran in", literally "he entered running"; ''salió flotando'' "it floated out", literally "it exited floating". 

The terms verb framing and satellite framing are not restricted to Romance and Germanic languages, respectively. Many languages can be assigned to one of the two systems. For example, verb framing is used in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. (In the latter, ''dakhala rākiḍan'' means "he entered running", with the perfect form ''dakhala'' meaning "he entered" and the participle ''rākiḍan'' meaning "running".) Satellite framing is common in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Some languages use both strategies. For example, [[Persian language|Persian]] is chiefly verb-framed, but also has such compounds as ''dar-āmadan'' ({{lang|fa|درآمدن}}, "to come in") from ''dar'' ("in") and ''āmadan'' ("to come").

==Examples from English and French==

Romance languages, such as French, are normally verb-framed, and Germanic languages, such as English, are satellite-framed. This means that when expressing motion events, English speakers typically express manner in the verb, and French speakers (like Italian &amp; Spanish speakers) typically express path in the verb and either leave out the manner of motion completely or express it in a complement of manner. Thus, to take one example, "He ran into the room" is routinely translated as ''Il est entré dans la pièce''; only sometimes will it be ''Il est entré dans la pièce en courant'' ("he entered the room running").&lt;ref&gt;This was already mentioned in Vinay &amp; Darbelnet (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; This means, first, that the verb itself normally does not express manner in French, as opposed to what is generally the case in English; and if manner is expressed, it is expressed in a complement (or, more precisely, an adjunct) of manner: ''en courant'' ("running").

The question, then, remains of whether to express manner or not. It is not always easy to know, but manner is generally left unexpressed when it can be considered to be self-evident and can be inferred from the context; expressing the manner then tends to sound unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;"Users of verb-framed languages specify MANNER in clauses with PATH verbs only when motor pattern or rate of movement is really at issue" (Slobin 2004: 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "He ran into the room" can be translated as ''Il est entré dans la pièce en courant'' because it is slightly unusual to run into a room and so manner should be mentioned, but translating "He walked into the room" as ''Il est entré dans la pièce à pied'' ("on foot") or ''en marchant'' ("walking") is distinctly odd because it is the usual way in which one enters a room. Only in a case where someone was riding a bicycle before or moving in another unusual way can the fact that he "walked" into the room be considered to be relevant. The same can be said for this example: saying "I'm flying to London" when on a plane is normal in English, but saying "Je vole" ("I'm flying") in French for the same situation is odd: first, because the verb is not where one should normally express manner in the first place and also because flying is a common way of travelling to London from France.

This means that the choice of complement and in particular the choice of the preposition can also be affected: in English, the particle or the prepositional phrase (the "satellite") is where the path is expressed, with the use of a dynamic preposition: "(walk) into (the room)", "(fly) to (London)", whereas in French, it is the verb that normally expresses the path. A preposition like "à" ("to, at, in") is ambiguous between a static reading (''Je suis à Paris''/"I'm in Paris") and a dynamic reading (''Je vais à Paris''/"I'm going to Paris"). If the verb is dynamic and expresses directed motion (motion with an intrinsic direction), ''à'' can express movement (''Je vais à Paris''). If not, as is the case for instance with ''voler'' ("to fly"), which expresses manner of motion but not directed motion, ''à'' tends to receive a static and not a dynamic, interpretation: ''je vole à Paris'' would mean something like "I'm flying IN Paris", and not "I'm flying TO Paris". Using the same structure as in English can be doubly misleading, as the verb and the preposition are both unusual; ''Je vais à'' ("I'm going to")/''Je suis en route'' ("I am on my way") ''vers''/''pour Paris'' ("towards/for Paris") are much better.

==Opposition and its limitations==

Although languages can generally be classified as "verb-framed"/"satellite-framed", not everything works exactly in that way. First, languages can use both strategies, as is the case with the Latinate verbs mentioned supra for English: "enter", "ascend", "exit". The existence of equipollently-framed languages in which both manner and path are expressed in verbs has been pointed out (Slobin 2004). It could be true of [[Chinese language|Chinese]],&lt;ref&gt;Liang Chen, Jiansheng Guo, 2009, Motion events in Chinese novels: Evidence for an equipollently-framed language, ''Journal of Pragmatics'' 41 (2009) 1749–1766&lt;/ref&gt; for instance.

Many Native American languages, such as the extinct [[Atsugewi language|Atsugewi]], do not select verbs of motion based on path or manner. Instead, verbs of motion are specific to the kind of object that is moving or being moved.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng, M., &amp; Goldin-Meadow, S. Thought before language: How deaf and hearing children express motion events across cultures. Cognition, 2002, 85, 145-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39588">{{about|the theory of algebraic varieties over finite fields||Weil conjecture (disambiguation){{!}}Weil conjecture}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''Weil conjectures''' were some highly influential proposals  by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|first=André |last=Weil|year=1949}}, which led to a successful multi-decade program to prove them, in which many leading researchers developed the framework of modern algebraic geometry and number theory.

The conjectures concern the [[generating function]]s (known as [[local zeta-function]]s) derived from counting the number of points on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s. A variety ''V'' over a finite field with ''q'' elements has a finite number of [[rational point]]s (with coordinates in the original field), as well as points with coordinates in any finite extension of the original field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of points over the extension field with ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; elements.

Weil conjectured that such ''zeta-functions'' for smooth varieties should be [[rational function]]s, should satisfy a form of [[functional equation]], and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the [[Riemann zeta function]], a kind of generating function for prime integers, which obeys a functional equation and (conjecturally) has its zeroes restricted by the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. The rationality was proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Bernard Dwork|first=Bernard| last=Dwork|year=1960}}, the functional equation by {{harvs|txt|last=Grothendieck|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Grothendieck|year=1965}}, and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis by {{harvs|txt|last=Deligne|first=Pierre|authorlink=Pierre Deligne|year=1974}}.

==Background and history==
The earliest antecedent of the Weil conjectures is by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and appears in section VII of his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' {{harv|Mazur|1974}}, concerned with [[roots of unity]] and  [[Gaussian period]]s. In article 358, he moves on from the periods that build up towers of quadratic extensions, for the construction of regular polygons; and assumes that ''p'' is a prime number such that  {{nowrap|''p'' &amp;minus; 1}} is divisible by 3. Then there is a [[cyclic cubic field]] inside the cyclotomic field of ''p''th roots of unity, and a [[normal integral basis]] of periods for the integers of this field  (an instance of the [[Hilbert–Speiser theorem]]). Gauss constructs the order-3 periods, corresponding to the [[cyclic group]] ('''Z'''/''p'''''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; of non-zero residues modulo ''p'' under multiplication and its unique subgroup of index three. Gauss lets &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}''&lt;/math&gt; be its cosets. Taking the periods (sums of roots of unity) corresponding to these cosets applied to &lt;math&gt;\exp(2\pi i/p)&lt;/math&gt;, he notes that these periods have a multiplication table that is accessible to calculation. Products are linear combinations of the periods, and he determines the coefficients. He sets, for example, &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{R}\mathfrak{R})&lt;/math&gt; equal to the number of elements of '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' which are in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; and which, after being increased by one, are also in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;. He proves that this number and related ones are the coefficients of the products of the periods. To see the relation of these sets to the Weil conjectures, notice that if α and {{nowrap|&amp;alpha; + 1}} are both in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exist ''x'' and ''y'' in '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' such that {{nowrap begin}}''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;alpha;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;alpha; + 1{{nowrap end}}; consequently, &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 1 = y^3&lt;/math&gt;}. Therefore &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{R}\mathfrak{R})&lt;/math&gt; is the number of solutions to {{nowrap begin}}''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}} in the finite field '''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''. The other coefficients have similar interpretations. Gauss's determination of the coefficients of the products of the periods therefore counts the number of points on these [[elliptic curve]]s, and as a byproduct he proves the analog of the Riemann hypothesis.

The Weil conjectures in the special case of [[algebraic curve]]s were conjectured by {{harvs|txt|first=Emil|last=Artin|authorlink=Emil Artin|year=1924}}. The case of curves over finite fields was proved by Weil, finishing the project started by [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves]] over finite fields. Their interest was obvious enough from within [[number theory]]: they implied  upper bounds for [[exponential sum]]s, a basic concern in [[analytic number theory]] {{harv|Moreno|2001}}.

What was really eye-catching, from the point of view of other mathematical areas, was the proposed connection with [[algebraic topology]]. Given that finite fields are ''discrete'' in nature, and topology speaks only about the ''continuous'', the detailed formulation of Weil (based on working out some examples) was striking and novel. It suggested that geometry over finite fields should fit into well-known patterns relating to [[Betti number]]s, the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]] and so on.

The analogy with topology suggested that a new homological theory be set up applying within [[algebraic geometry]]. This took two decades (it was a central aim of the work and school of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]) building up on initial suggestions from [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]]. The rationality part of the conjectures was proved first by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Bernard Dwork|first=Bernard |last=Dwork|year=1960}}, using [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] methods. {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1965}} and his collaborators  established the rationality conjecture, the functional equation and the link to Betti numbers by using the properties of [[étale cohomology]], a new cohomology theory developed by Grothendieck and Artin for attacking the Weil conjectures, as outlined in  {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1960}}. 
Of the four conjectures  the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was the hardest to prove. Motivated by the proof of {{harvtxt|Serre|1960}} of an analogue of the Weil conjectures for [[Kähler manifold]]s, Grothendieck envisioned a proof based on his [[standard conjectures on algebraic cycles]] {{harv|Kleiman|1968}}. However, Grothendieck's standard conjectures remain open (except for the [[hard Lefschetz theorem]], which was proved by Deligne by extending his work on the Weil conjectures), and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by  {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Pierre Deligne|last=Deligne|year=1974}}, using the  étale cohomology theory but circumventing the use of standard conjectures by an ingenious argument.

{{harvtxt|Deligne|1980}} found and proved a generalization of the Weil conjectures, bounding the weights of the pushforward of a sheaf.

==Statement of the Weil conjectures==

Suppose that ''X'' is a [[non-singular]] ''n''-dimensional [[projective algebraic variety]] over the field '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''q'' elements. The '''zeta function''' ζ(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') of ''X'' is by definition

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(X, s) = \exp\left(\sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{N_m}{m} q^{-ms}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;  is the number of points of ''X'' defined over the degree ''m'' extension '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Weil conjectures state:

#(Rationality) ζ(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') is a ''[[rational function]]'' of {{nowrap begin}}''T'' = ''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;s&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}}. More precisely, ζ(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') can be written as a finite alternating product &lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\prod_{i=0}^{2n} P_i(q^{-s})^{(-1)^{i+1}} = \frac{P_1(T)\dotsb P_{2n-1}(T)}{P_0(T)\dotsb P_{2n}(T)},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dl&gt; where each ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') is an integral polynomial. Furthermore, {{nowrap begin}}''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') = 1 &amp;minus; T{{nowrap end}}, {{nowrap begin}}''P''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') = 1 &amp;minus; ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''T''{{nowrap end}}, and for {{nowrap|1 &amp;le; i &amp;le; 2n &amp;minus; 1}}, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') factors over '''C''' as &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\prod_j (1 - \alpha_{ij}T)&lt;/math&gt; for some numbers α&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;.
#(Functional equation and Poincaré duality) The zeta function satisfies &lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;math&gt;\zeta(X,n-s)=\pm q^{\frac{nE}{2}-Es}\zeta(X,s)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dl&gt; or equivalently &lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;math&gt;\zeta(X,q^{-n}T^{-1})=\pm q^{\frac{nE}{2}}T^E\zeta(X,T)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dl&gt; where ''E'' is the [[Euler characteristic]] of ''X''.  In particular, for each ''i'', the numbers α&lt;sub&gt;2''n''-''i'',1&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2''n''-''i'',2&lt;/sub&gt;, … equal the numbers ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/α&lt;sub&gt;''i'',1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/α&lt;sub&gt;''i'',2&lt;/sub&gt;, … in some order.
#(Riemann hypothesis) |α&lt;sub&gt;''i,j''&lt;/sub&gt;| = ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''i''/2&lt;/sup&gt; for all {{nowrap|1 &amp;le; ''i'' &amp;le; 2''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} and all ''j''.  This implies that all zeros of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') lie on the "critical line" of complex numbers ''s'' with real part ''k''/2.
#(Betti numbers) If ''X'' is a (good) "[[reduction mod p|reduction mod ''p'']]" of a [[non-singular]] projective variety ''Y'' defined over a number field embedded in the field of complex numbers, then the degree of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Betti number]] of the space of complex points of ''Y''.

==Examples==

===The projective line===
The simplest example (other than a point) is to take ''X'' to be the projective line.  The number of points of ''X'' over a field with ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; elements is just ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (where the "+&amp;nbsp;1" comes from the "[[point at infinity]]"). The zeta function is just

:1/(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;)(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;).

It is easy to check all parts of the Weil conjectures directly. For example, the corresponding complex variety is the [[Riemann sphere]] and its initial Betti numbers are&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1.

===Projective space===
It is not much harder to do ''n'' dimensional projective space.
The number of points of ''X'' over a field with ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; elements is
just ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;2''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''nm''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The zeta function is just

:1/(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;)(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;)(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;).

It is again easy to check all parts of the Weil conjectures directly. ([[Complex projective space]] gives the relevant Betti numbers, which nearly determine the answer.)

The number of points on the projective line and projective space are so easy to calculate because they can be written as disjoint unions of a finite number of copies of affine spaces. It is also easy to prove the Weil conjectures for other spaces, such as Grassmannians and flag varieties, which have the same "paving" property.

===Elliptic curves===
These give the first non-trivial cases of the Weil conjectures (proved by Hasse).
If ''E'' is an elliptic curve over a finite field with ''q'' elements, then the number of points of ''E'' defined over the field with ''q&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' elements is 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;α&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus; β&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, 
where α and β are complex conjugates with absolute value √''q''.
The zeta function is

: ζ(''E'',''s'') = (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;α''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;)(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;β''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;)(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Weil cohomology==

Weil suggested that the conjectures would follow from the existence of a suitable "[[Weil cohomology theory]]" for varieties over finite fields, similar to the usual cohomology with rational coefficients for complex varieties.
His idea was that if ''F'' is the [[Frobenius automorphism]] over the finite field, then the number of points of the variety ''X'' over the field of order ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; is the number of fixed points of ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;  (acting on all points of the variety ''X'' defined over the algebraic closure). In algebraic topology the number of fixed points of an automorphism can be worked out using the [[Lefschetz fixed point theorem]], given as an alternating sum of traces on the [[cohomology group]]s. So if there were similar cohomology groups for varieties over finite fields, then the zeta function could be expressed in terms of them.

The first problem with this is that the coefficient field for a Weil cohomology theory cannot be the rational numbers. To see this consider the case of a [[supersingular]] [[elliptic curve]] over a finite field of characteristic ''p''.  The endomorphism ring of this is an order in a [[quaternion algebra]] over the rationals, and should act on the first cohomology group, which should be a 2-dimensional vector space over the coefficient field by analogy with the case of a complex elliptic curve. However a quaternion algebra over the rationals cannot act on a 2-dimensional vector space over the rationals. The same argument eliminates the possibility of the coefficient field being the reals or the ''p''-adic numbers, because the quaternion algebra is still a division algebra over these fields. However it does not eliminate the possibility that the coefficient field is the field of ''l''-adic numbers for some prime ''l''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''p'', because over these fields the division algebra splits and becomes a matrix algebra, which can act on a 2-dimensional vector space. Grothendieck and [[Michael Artin]] managed to construct suitable cohomology theories over the field of ''l''-adic numbers for each prime ''l''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''p'', called [[l-adic cohomology]].

==Grothendieck's proofs of three of the four conjectures==
By the end of 1964 Grothendieck together with Artin and [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] proved the Weil conjectures apart from the most difficult third conjecture above (the "Riemann hypothesis" conjecture) (Grothendieck 1965). The general theorems about étale cohomology allowed Grothendieck to prove an analogue of the Lefschetz fixed point formula for the ''l''-adic cohomology theory, and by applying it to the Frobenius automorphism ''F'' he was able to prove the conjectured formula for the zeta function:
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)=\frac{P_1(T)\cdots P_{2n-1}(T)}{P_0(T)P_2(T)\cdots P_{2n}(T)}&lt;/math&gt;
where each polynomial ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the determinant of ''I &amp;minus; TF'' on the ''l''-adic cohomology group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The rationality of the zeta function follows immediately. The functional equation for the zeta function follows from Poincaré duality for ''l''-adic cohomology, and the relation with complex Betti numbers of a lift follows from a comparison theorem between ''l''-adic and ordinary cohomology for complex varieties.

More generally, Grothendieck proved a similar formula for the zeta function (or "generalized L-function") of a sheaf ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;Z(X_0, F_0, t) = \prod_{x\in |X_0|}\det(1-F^*_xt^{\deg(x)}|F_0)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
as a product over cohomology groups:
:&lt;math&gt;Z(X_0, F_0, t) = \prod_{i}\det(1-F^* t|H^i_c(F))^{(-1)^{i+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
The special case of the constant sheaf gives the usual zeta function.

==Deligne's first proof of the Riemann hypothesis conjecture==
{{harvtxt|Verdier|1974}}, {{harvtxt|Serre|1975}}, {{harvtxt|Katz|1976}} and {{harvtxt|Freitag|Kiehl|1988}} gave expository accounts of the first  proof of {{harvtxt|Deligne|1974}}. Much of the background in ''l''-adic cohomology is described in {{harv|Deligne|1977}}.

Deligne's first proof of the remaining third Weil conjecture (the "Riemann hypothesis conjecture") used the following steps:

===Use of Lefschetz pencils===
*Grothendieck expressed  the zeta function in terms of the trace of Frobenius on ''l''-adic cohomology groups, so the Weil conjectures for a ''d''-dimensional variety ''V'' over a finite field with ''q'' elements depend on showing that the eigenvalues α of Frobenius acting on the ''i'''th ''l''-adic cohomology group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') of ''V'' have absolute  values |&amp;alpha;|=''q''&lt;sup&gt;''i''/2&lt;/sup&gt; (for an embedding of the algebraic elements of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; into the complex numbers).
*After [[blowing up]] ''V'' and extending the base field, one may assume that the variety ''V'' has a morphism onto the projective line '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a finite number of singular fibers with very mild (quadratic) singularities. The theory of monodromy of [[Lefschetz pencil]]s, introduced for complex varieties (and ordinary cohomology) by {{harvtxt|Lefschetz|1924}}, and extended by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1972}} and {{harvtxt|Deligne|Katz|1973}} to ''l''-adic cohomology, relates the cohomology of ''V'' to that of its fibers.  The relation depends on the space ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''vanishing cycles''', the subspace of the cohomology ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) of a non-singular fiber ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, spanned by classes that vanish on singular fibers.
*The [[Leray spectral sequence]] relates the middle cohomology group of ''V'' to the cohomology of the fiber and base. The hard part to deal with is more or less a group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''P''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''j''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''E'') = ''H''{{su|p=1|b=c}}(''U'',''E''), where ''U'' is the points the projective line with non-singular fibers, and ''j'' is the inclusion of ''U'' into the projective line, and ''E'' is the sheaf with fibers the spaces ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of vanishing cycles.

===The key estimate===
The heart of Deligne's proof is to show that the sheaf ''E'' over ''U'' is pure, in other words to find the absolute values of the eigenvalues of Frobenius on its stalks. This  is done by studying the zeta functions of the even powers ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''E'' and applying   Grothendieck's formula for the zeta functions as  alternating products over cohomology groups. The crucial idea of considering even ''k'' powers of ''E'' was inspired by the paper {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Robert Alexander Rankin|last=Rankin|year=1939}}, who used a similar idea with ''k''=2   for bounding  the [[Ramanujan tau function]]. {{harvtxt|Langlands|1970|loc=section 8}} pointed out that a generalization of Rankin's result for higher even values of ''k'' would imply the [[Ramanujan conjecture]], and Deligne realized that in the case of zeta functions of varieties, Grothendieck's theory of zeta functions of sheaves provided  an analogue of this generalization.
*The poles of the zeta function of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; are found using Grothendieck's formula
::&lt;math&gt;Z(U,E^k,T) = \frac{\det(1-F^* T|H^1_c(E^k))}{\det(1-F^* T|H^0_c(E^k))\det(1-F^* T|H^2_c(E^k))}&lt;/math&gt;
:and calculating the cohomology groups in the denominator explicitly. The ''H''{{su|p=0|b=c}} term is usually just 1 as ''U'' is usually not compact, and the ''H''{{su|p=2|b=c}} can be calculated explicitly as follows. Poincaré duality relates ''H''{{su|p=2|b=c}}(''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) to ''H''{{su|p=0|}}(''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;), which is in turn the space of covariants of the monodromy group, which is the geometric fundamental group of ''U'' acting on the fiber of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; at a point. The fiber of  ''E'' has a bilinear form induced by [[cup product]], which is antisymmetric if ''d'' is even, and makes ''E'' into a symplectic space. (This is a little inaccurate: Deligne did later show that ''E''&amp;cap;''E''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 by using the [[hard Lefschetz theorem]], this requires the Weil conjectures, and the proof of the Weil conjectures really has to use a slightly more complicated argument with ''E''/''E''&amp;cap;''E''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/sup&gt; rather than ''E''.) An argument of Kazhdan and Margulis shows that the image of the monodromy group acting on ''E'', given by the [[Picard–Lefschetz formula]], is Zariski dense in a symplectic group and therefore has the same invariants, which are well known from classical invariant theory. Keeping track of the action of Frobenius in this calculation shows that its eigenvalues are all ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''(''d''&amp;minus;1)/2+1&lt;/sup&gt;, so  the zeta function of ''Z''(''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;,''T'') has poles only at ''T''=1/''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''(''d''&amp;minus;1)''/2+1&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The Euler product for the zeta function of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is
::&lt;math&gt;Z(E^k,T) = \prod_x \frac{1}{Z(E^k_x,T)}&lt;/math&gt;
:If ''k'' is '''even''' then all the coefficients of the factors on the right (considered as power series in ''T'') are '''non-negative'''; this follows by writing
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\det(1-T^{\deg(x)}F_x|E^k)} =\exp\left(\sum_{n&gt;0}\frac{T^n}{n}\text{Trace}(F_x^n|E)^k\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:and using the fact that the traces of powers of ''F'' are rational, so their ''k'' powers are non-negative as ''k'' is even.  Deligne proves the rationality of the traces by relating them to numbers of points of varieties, which are always (rational) integers.
*The powers series for ''Z''(''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''T'') converges for ''T'' less than the absolute value 1/''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''(''d''&amp;minus;1)/2+1&lt;/sup&gt; of its only possible pole. When ''k'' is even  the coefficients of all its Euler factors are non-negative, so that each of the Euler factors has coefficients bounded by a constant times the coefficients of ''Z''(''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''T'') and therefore converges on the same region and has no poles in this region. So for ''k'' even the polynomials  ''Z''(''E''{{su|p=''k''|b=''x''}}, ''T'') have no zeros in this region, or in other words the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the stalks of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; have absolute value at most ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''(''d''&amp;minus;1)''/2+1&lt;/sup&gt;.
*This estimate can be used to find the absolute value of any eigenvalue α of Frobenius on a fiber of ''E'' as follows. For any integer ''k'', &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is an eigenvalue of Frobenius on a stalk of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, which for ''k'' even is bounded by ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1+''k''(''d''&amp;minus;1)/2&lt;/sup&gt;. So
::&lt;math&gt;|\alpha^k|\le q^{k(d-1)/2 +1}&lt;/math&gt;
:As this is true for arbitrarily large even ''k'', this implies that
::&lt;math&gt;|\alpha|\le q^{(d-1)/2 }.&lt;/math&gt;
:[[Poincaré duality]] then implies that
::&lt;math&gt;|\alpha|=q^{(d-1)/2 }.&lt;/math&gt;

===Completion of the proof===
The deduction of the Riemann hypothesis from this estimate is mostly a fairly straightforward use of standard techniques and is done as follows.
*The eigenvalues of Frobenius on ''H''{{su|p=1|b=c}}(''U'',''E'') can now be estimated as they are the zeros of the zeta function of the sheaf ''E''. This zeta function can be written as an Euler product of zeta functions of the stalks of ''E'', and using the estimate for the eigenvalues on these stalks shows that this product converges for |''T''|&lt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''d''/2&amp;minus;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, so that there are no zeros of the zeta function in this region. This implies that the eigenvalues of Frobenius on ''E'' are at most ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''d''/2+1/2&lt;/sup&gt; in absolute value (in fact it will soon be seen that they have absolute value exactly ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''d''/2&lt;/sup&gt;). This step of the argument is very similar to the usual proof that the Riemann zeta function has no zeros with real part greater than 1, by writing it as an Euler product.
*The conclusion of this is that the eigenvalues α of the Frobenius of a variety of even dimension ''d'' on the middle cohomology group satisfy
::&lt;math&gt;  |\alpha| \le q^{d/2+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
:To obtain the Riemann hypothesis one needs to eliminate the 1/2 from the exponent. This can be done as follows. Applying this estimate to any even power ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''V'' and using the [[Künneth formula]] shows that the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the middle cohomology of a variety ''V'' of any dimension ''d'' satisfy
::&lt;math&gt; |\alpha^k| \le q^{kd/2+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
:As this is true for arbitrarily large even ''k'', this implies that
::&lt;math&gt;|\alpha| \le q^{d/2}&lt;/math&gt;
:[[Poincaré duality]] then implies that
::&lt;math&gt;|\alpha| = q^{d/2}.&lt;/math&gt;
*This proves the Weil conjectures for the middle cohomology of a variety. The Weil conjectures for the cohomology below the middle dimension follow from this by applying the [[weak Lefschetz theorem]], and the conjectures for cohomology above the middle dimension then follow from Poincaré duality.

==Deligne's second proof==
{{harvtxt|Deligne|1980}} found and proved a generalization of the Weil conjectures, bounding the weights of the pushforward of a sheaf. In practice it is this generalization rather than the original Weil conjectures that is mostly used in applications, such as the [[hard Lefschetz theorem]]. Much of the second proof is a rearrangement of the ideas of his first proof. The main extra idea needed is an argument closely related to the theorem of [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin]], used by Deligne  to show that various ''L''-series do not have zeros with real part 1.

A constructible sheaf on a variety over a finite field is called pure of weight β if for all points ''x'' the eigenvalues of the Frobenius at ''x'' all have absolute value ''N''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;β/2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is called mixed of weight ≤β if it can be written as repeated extensions by pure sheaves with weights ≤β.

Deligne's theorem states that if ''f'' is a morphism of schemes of finite type over a finite field, then ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; takes mixed sheaves of weight ≤β to mixed sheaves of weight  ≤β+i.

The original Weil conjectures follow by taking ''f'' to be a morphism from a smooth projective variety to a point and considering the constant sheaf '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; on the variety. This gives an upper bound on the absolute values of the eigenvalues of Frobenius, and Poincaré duality then shows that this is also a lower bound.

In general ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; does not take pure sheaves to pure sheaves. However it does when a suitable form of Poincaré duality holds, for example if ''f'' is smooth and proper, or if one works with [[perverse sheaf|perverse sheaves]] rather than sheaves as in {{harvtxt|Beilinson|Bernstein|Deligne|1982}}.

Inspired by the work of {{harvtxt|Witten|1982}} on [[Morse theory]], {{harvtxt|Laumon|1987}} found another proof,  using  Deligne's [[Fourier–Deligne transform|''l''-adic Fourier transform]], which allowed him to simplify Deligne's proof by avoiding the use of the method of Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin.  His proof  generalizes the classical calculation of the absolute value of [[Gauss sum]]s using the fact that the norm of a Fourier transform has a simple relation to the norm of the original function. {{harvtxt|Kiehl|Weissauer|2001}} used Laumon's proof as the basis for their exposition of Deligne's theorem. {{harvtxt|Katz|2001}} gave a further simplification of Laumon's proof, using monodromy in the spirit of Deligne's first proof. {{harvtxt|Kedlaya|2006}} gave another proof using the Fourier transform, replacing etale cohomology with [[rigid cohomology]].

==Applications==
