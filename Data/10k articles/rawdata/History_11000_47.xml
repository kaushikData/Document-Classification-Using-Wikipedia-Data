In the '''aftermath of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]''', there were multiple and far-ranging events that were observed. Besides the immediate impact on the [[Casualties of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks|victims]] and their families, the attacks caused [[Reactions to the November 2008 Mumbai attacks|widespread anger among the Indian public]], and condemnations from countries throughout the world.

The immediate impact was felt on Mumbai and Maharashtra state, and throughout urban India. There were also after-effects on the Indian government, centre-state relations within India, [[Indo-Pakistani relations]], domestic impact within [[Pakistan]], the [[United States]]'s relationships with both countries, the US-led NATO war in Afghanistan, and on the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror]].
There was also impact on the region of [[Kashmir]] and this also led to the [[2010 Kashmir Unrest]].

==Immediate impact==
===Impact on the attack locations===
[[File:Cafe leopold damage Mumbai nov 2008.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bullet marks left at Cafe Leopold]]
The [[Leopold Cafe]] opened its doors to customers just four days after the attacks. The owners wanted to repair the damaged parts of the cafe, while retaining some of the damaged pieces as a tribute to those who lost their lives in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-01/mumbai/27925961_1_jehani-leopold-cafe-terrorists|title=Defiant Leopold opens doors to customers|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=3 December 2008|publisher=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security forces handed back control of the [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower|Taj Mahal Hotel]] to the Taj group on 1 December 2008, and work on its repairs began that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-02/mumbai/27899914_1_taj-mahal-hotel-taj-group-historic-hotel|title=After ravage, work on to resurrect Taj|date=2 December 2008|accessdate=3 December 2008|publisher=The Times of India|first1=Bella|last1=Jaisinghani}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrated artist [[M.F.

Several young Chabad couples from all over the world have stepped forward to move to Mumbai and continue the movement's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200812011511.htm|title=Nariman House to be reopened soon|publisher=The Hindu News Update Service|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=3 December 2008|location=Chennai, India| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081204112131/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200812011511.htm| archivedate= 4 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on Mumbai===
[[File:Mumbai Terror Protest.JPG|thumb|300px|Citizens outside the Taj Mahal Palace demanding government action]]
In the aftermath of the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]], all schools and colleges, and most offices were closed. The [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] and [[National Stock Exchange of India|National Stock Exchange]] remained closed on 27 November 2008.&lt;ref name="IBN-BSE"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/bse-nse-to-remain-closed-on-thursday/79149-16.html |title=BSE, NSE to remain closed on Thursday |publisher=IBNLive.com |date=27 November 2008 |accessdate=27 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522130250/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/bse-nse-to-remain-closed-on-thursday/79149-16.html |archivedate=22 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting of [[Bollywood]] films and TV series had also been halted in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shooting of films and TV serials hauled |publisher=MiD-Day |url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2008/nov/271108-shooting-films-hauled-due-to-terror-attacks.htm |date=27 November 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081204115608/http://www.mid-day.com/news/2008/nov/271108-shooting-films-hauled-due-to-terror-attacks.htm| archivedate= 4 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many international airlines temporarily discontinued operations to Mumbai, in the interest of passenger and crew safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122774214504461219?mod=yahoo_hs&amp;ru=yahoo |title=Mumbai Notebook: Squeeze to India's Cash-Strapped Carriers |work=Wall Street Journal |date=27 November 2008 |accessdate=27 November 2008 |last=Prada |first=Paulo |author2=Daniel Fitzpatrick|author3=Nitin Luthra|author4=Dan Michaels|author5= Jeanne Whalen| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081203035805/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122774214504461219.html?mod=yahoo_hs&amp;ru=yahoo| archivedate= 3 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian Cricket League]]'s ongoing tournament in [[Ahmedabad]] was canceled. The two remaining One Day Internationals of the seven match series between the visiting [[England cricket team]] and [[Indian cricket team|India]] were cancelled. The visiting team flew home, but returned to continue the [[Test cricket|test]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mumbai terrorist attacks: England set to leave India but Test series could still go ahead |work=Daily Telegraph |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/india/3529913/Mumbai-Bombay-terrorist-attacks---England-cricket-squad-abandon-tour-of-India.html |date=27 November 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008 | location=London | first1=Derek | last1=Pringle | first2=Mike | last2=Norrish | first3=Vicki | last3=Hodges}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the venue of the second India-England test match, scheduled on 19–23 December, was shifted from Mumbai to Chennai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/007200811281760.htm|publisher=The Hindu|date = 28 November 2008|title = Chennai to host India-England 2nd Test match}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural [[Twenty20 Champions League]], scheduled from 3 to 10 December, Mumbai being one of the host cities, was postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mumbai terror attack: T20 Champions League postponed |publisher=Express India |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Mumbai-terror-attack--T20-Champions-League-postponed/391419/ |date=27 November 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113152602/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Mumbai-terror-attack--T20-Champions-League-postponed/391419/ |archivedate=13 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks have brought into significance the issue of 379 Indian boats and 336 fishermen apprehended by the Pakistan marine agency, for entering their waters. Nearly 200 of the boats have reportedly been auctioned, now recognised as a national security issue for India. On 28 November, Pakistan released 99 fishermen who were apprehended, as part of confidence building measures with India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Vikram Rautela |title=Boats auctioned by Pak pose a threat, India seeks details |work=The Indian Express |location=India |date=1 December 2008 |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/boats-auctioned-by-pak-pose-a-threat-india-seeks-details/392730/ |accessdate=9 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202044538/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/boats-auctioned-by-pak-pose-a-threat-india-seeks-details/392730/ |archivedate=2 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were threats to blow up [[ITC Fortune Hotel]] in [[Navi Mumbai]], after Mumbai police received a bomb threat from terrorists. Rumours about further shootings at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus were doing the rounds in Mumbai on 28 November, and were widely reported by the news channels. The Railway Police denied these rumours, but stopped trains approaching CST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/nov/26-update-terror-in-mumbai.htm |title=NSG sanitising Taj Hotel |publisher=Rediff.com |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=29 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081201103206/http://www.rediff.com./news/2008/nov/26-update-terror-in-mumbai.htm| archivedate= 1 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maharashtra state government===
After seeing the disparity between the quality of helmets and bulletproof vests used by NSG commandos and the police, the Police Commissioner of [[Pune]], Satyapal Singh, said his police officers needed the same quality equipment as used by the NSG to reduce deaths and improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Need-NSG-like-equipment--cops/391939 |title=Need NSG-like equipment: cops |work=The Indian Express |location=India |date=29 November 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maharashtra government has planned to buy 36 speed boats to patrol the coastal areas, and several helicopters for the same purpose. It will also create an Anti-Terror force known as the [[Force One (Mumbai Police)|Force One]], and it will upgrade all the weapons that Mumbai Police currently have.

The CST railway station was upgraded with metal detectors, but reports say that these are ineffective because the attendants cannot hear their beeps in the crowd. Civilians have tested these using their own licensed weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/world/story/57012.html |title=How India officials fumbled, McClatchy Newspapers, Padma Rao Sundarji, 03-Dec-2008 |publisher=Mcclatchydc.com |date=3 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207034850/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/world/story/57012.html |archive-date=7 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maharashtra's new Home Minister, Jayant Patil, was forced to defend the performance of the police in the legislative assembly, against demands from the opposition parties for resignations from the police chief and other officials.&lt;ref name="HinduPatilDefends"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/18/stories/2008121861181000.htm |title=Maharashtra Minister defends role of police, Meena Menon, Hindu, 18-Dec-2008 |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to take forward the 26/11 probe, the Mumbai Police will send a three members team to the United States in this regard, sources said. The team comprising Inspector Bharti, Inspector Kadam and Inspector Arun Chavan will share the findings of the 26 November 2008 Mumbai attacks, with apex US investigative agency FBI. Mumbai police have sent a proposal to the Home Ministry, stating the need to establish direct contact with the FBI, to facilitate investigation in the Mumbai terror attacks. It is believed that the team, if permitted to go, will share the evidence gathered by Mumbai police, which prove Pakistan's hand in the attacks on the nation's integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaylive.com/news/2611-probe-mumbai-police-team-to-visit-us/607275.html |title=2611 Probe Mumbai Police Team to Visit US |publisher=Samaylive.com |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After-effects==
===Government of India===
[[File:3 December 2008 Gateway protest march 5.jpg|thumb|200px|Protests against the Government were witnessed all across the Country]]
A [[Cabinet Committee on Security]] meeting was held on Tuesday, 2 December, to discuss expanding the [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) to cities outside Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/india-to-bolster-nsg-strength/00/46/50351/on |title=India to bolster NSG strength |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=29 November 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to have permanent presence of NSG anti-terrorist squads in cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata, to avoid wasting precious time travelling from Delhi.

All NSG commandos will now undergo a new module of training, to learn how to deal with future anti-siege operations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Election_Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080074591&amp;type=News |title=Mumbai attacks learning experience for NSG |publisher=NDTV.com |date=29 November 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202052715/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Election_Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080074591&amp;type=News |archivedate=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the Taj terrorists were in a gun battle for 59&amp;nbsp;hours continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/29/content_10430375.htm |title=59-hour Mumbai terror siege comes to end_English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=29 November 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, on an all party conference, declared that legal framework will be strengthened in the battle against terrorism and a federal anti-terrorist intelligence and investigation agency, like the [[FBI]], will soon be set up to co-ordinate actions against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 December, the [[Lok Sabha]] approved two new anti-terror bills, which are expected to pass the upper house ([[Rajya Sabha]]) on the 19th. One sets up a National Investigation Agency, similar to the [[FBI]], with sweeping powers of investigation. The second strengthens existing anti-terror laws, to allow suspects to be detained without bail for up to six months, on the orders of a judge.&lt;ref name="BBCTwoLaws"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7787434.stm |title=India to tighten anti-terror laws, BBC UK, 17-Dec-2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centre-State relations===
The ''National Investigation Agency Bill, 2008'', sets up a central agency for investigating terrorism related crimes. However, law and order is a state subject in the [[Constitution of India]], which had made such a law difficult to pass in the past.

Union Home Minister [[P. Chidambaram]] assured parliament that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not usurp the States' right in any manner. The central government would make use of its power only under "extraordinary" circumstances, and depending on the gravity of the situation, he said. "The agency will also have the powers to return the investigations to the State, if it so thinks. We have struck a balance between the right of the States and duties of the Centre to investigate."&lt;ref name="HinduBalance"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/18/stories/2008121856661000.htm |title=Aim is to strike a balance between rights and tough laws: Chidambaram, Aarti Dhar, The Hindu, 17-Dec-2008 |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Pakistani relations===

The attacks have damaged India's already strained relationship with [[Pakistan]]. [[India]] handed over two [[demarche]]s to [[Pakistan]]—one was submitted at the Foreign Office in [[Islamabad]] by Indian [[High Commissioner]] Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest over Pakistan's failure to curb terrorism emanating from its soil.&lt;ref name="ndtv.com"&gt;{{cite news

India handed over two [[demarche]]s to Pakistan – one was submitted at the Foreign Office in Islamabad by Indian High Commissioner Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest against Pakistan's inaction against terrorist groups operating within the country.&lt;ref name="ndtv.com" /&gt;

The Indian foreign ministry released a statement, describing the actions it expects Islamabad to take. "It was conveyed to the Pakistan high commissioner that Pakistan's actions needed to match the sentiments expressed by its leadership, that it wishes to have a qualitatively new relationship with India," the statement said. "He was informed that the recent terrorist attack on Mumbai was carried out by elements from Pakistan. Government expects that strong action would be taken against those elements, whosoever they may be, responsible for this outrage," it said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-36793420081201?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0

The [[CNN-IBN]] reported that India had asked Pakistan to hand over Mumbai Underworld Don [[Dawood Ibrahim]], [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] chief [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed]] and [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]] leader [[Maulana Masood Azhar]] for their suspected involvement in the Mumbai terror attack.

Dawood, India’s most wanted criminal, is suspected to have helped the LeT terrorists who attacked Mumbai on 26 November. Azhar, founder of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad, is on India's most wanted list of people it accuses of terrorism. India freed Azhar from prison in exchange for passengers on a hijacked [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://ibnlive.in.com/news/india-asks-for-dawood-masood-azhars-head/79482-3-1.html

''Times of India'', quoting Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, reported: "Now, we have in our demarche asked (for) the arrest and handover of those persons who are settled in Pakistan and who are fugitives of Indian law"

"...there are lists of about 20 persons. (These) lists are sometimes altered and this exercise is going on and we have renewed it in our demarche", Mukherjee said, adding that India "will await" Pakistan's response in the Indian-Arab forum.&lt;ref name="Demarche_to_Pakistan" /&gt;

In an interview with [[NDTV]], Pranab Mukherjee had not ruled out the option of military strikes against terror camps in Pakistan. Mukherjee said that every country has the right to protect its territorial integrity, and take appropriate action when necessary. He also said that it has become difficult to continue the peace process with Pakistan in this.&lt;ref name="CNN-IBN" /&gt;

====Denials from Pakistan====
Pakistan claimed&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/18/stories/2008121856681000.htm |title=No letter from Ajmal: Pakistan, Hindu, 18-Dec-2008 |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it had not received any letter from Mohammad Ajmal Amir, the lone terrorist arrested for the Mumbai attacks, seeking legal aid. It also repeated its denial on his Pakistani nationality, saying it needed "incontrovertible" evidence.&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials" /&gt;

The Mumbai police had said that the captured terrorist Ajmal Amir had written a letter to the Pakistan High Commission in India, asking for help, and that the letter had been given to India's central government. But the Pakistan High Commissioner to India, Shahid Malik, told Karan Thapar in the "India Tonight" program of CNBC TV-18, that no such letter had been received.&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials" /&gt;

According to Pakistan's ''Dawn'' newspaper, Ajmal's father in Pakistan had admitted that the man seen in photographs at the CST railway station was indeed his son. But the High Commissioner said they needed "something which is incontrovertible, which cannot be challenged in a court of law".&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials" /&gt;

Pakistan was also not contemplating giving Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, access to the FBI for investigation.&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials" /&gt;

====Interpol involvement====
Shortly after the Mumbai attacks, the [[Interpol]] team visited India and "promised help in securing the details of the 10 gunmen who attacked several places in Mumbai, 26 November, leaving at least 173 people dead and more than 300 others injured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/politics/interpol-team-arrives-in-islamabad-for-mumbai-attacks-probe_100134269.html |title=Interpol Team Arrives in Islamabad for Mumbai Attacks Probe |publisher=Thaindian.com |date=23 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpol Secretary General [[Ronald Noble]] arrived in Islamabad on Tuesday, 23 December, for talks over Indian allegations of involvement with Pakistan-based militant groups in the Mumbai terror attacks. Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble met Pakistan's security officials the same day.

However, in a later press-conference, the Interpol chief said that India didn't share any specific information with the Interpol regarding the terror attacks. He said that Interpol had the same information that had been with media and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7796993.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Interpol 'not given Mumbai data' | date=23 December 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=1108078 |title=Article |publisher=canada.com |date= |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105195101/http://www2.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=1108078 |archive-date=5 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's Minister for Information and Broadcasting [[Sherry Rehman]] claimed that this statement somehow supported Pakistan government's stance that Indian government has yet to share substantial and credible evidence with them, and again offered help in due cooperation to India, for joint investigations into the Mumbai attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=19188 |title=Cricket brings both nations together: Gilani |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date= |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/india-news/pakistan-again-asks-for-credible-evidence-on-mumbai-carnage_100134814.html |title=Pakistan Again Asks for Credible Evidence on Mumbai Carnage |publisher=Thaindian.com |date=24 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March, India gave Interpol the DNA of the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-03-10/india/28046600_1_world-police-body-interpol-member-countries-dna-samples | work=The Times Of India | first1=Vishwa | last1=Mohan | title=26/11: India to give DNA samples to Interpol | date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military preparations====

On 7 December, US Senator John McCain relayed a message from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to a group of Pakistanis at a lunch in Lahore, that if Pakistan did not arrest those involved with the attacks, India would begin aerial attacks against Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/07/stories/2008120757500100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=McCain warns Pakistan of Indian air strikes | date=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December, private intelligence agency Stratfor, in its latest report, said, "Indian military operations against targets in Pakistan have in fact been prepared, and await the signal to go forward". They also wrote that, "Indian military preparations, unlike previous cases, will be carried out in stealth". India's [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) has been put on high alert on the western sector, as well as the eastern sector, in order to prevent terrorist infiltration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-19/india/27914474_1_awami-national-party-pakistan-satyabrata-pal-stratfor | work=The Times Of India | title=India may still strike at Pakistan: US report | date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharma |first=Subramaniam |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=agKl44c4m8yg&amp;refer=india |title=India May Consider ‘Precision’ Strikes in Pakistan (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=20 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pakistani media, India had started deploying troops along the [[Rajasthan]] border, and had tightened security in and around the defence airstrips. More radars and quick reaction teams were then deployed along the India-Pakistan border. Indian forces were on regular firing exercises at locations, like Lathi Firing Range in [[Jaisalmer]], Mahsan in [[Bikaner]], [[Suratgarh]] and [[Ganganagar]].&lt;ref name="indiatoday.digitaltoday.in"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ramesh Vinayak |url=http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;issueid=85&amp;id=23314&amp;Itemid=1&amp;sectionid=4 |title=indiatoday.digitaltoday.in |publisher=indiatoday.digitaltoday.in |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December, Kamal Hyder, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Pakistan, wrote that the Pakistani "navy, air force and army were on red alert" and that "the chiefs of Pakistan's three armed forces were holding what had been described as an emergency meeting at general headquarters in Rawalpindi". He also wrote that "[t]he Pakistani air force have been seen visibly in a number of locations flying close to the Pakistani-India border, in what is being described as an aggressive patrolling mode, following reports that India is planning pre-emptive strikes against locations in Pakistan". A Pakistani airforce spokesperson said "[i]n view of the current environment, the PAF has enhanced its vigilance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2008/12/20081222102547699277.html |title=Pakistan military on 'high alert' |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=23 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said that Pakistan would mount an equal response "within minutes", to any Indian attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/0D76D46E36B67EC565257528001D342E?OpenDocument www.ptinews.com]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan continued to combat air patrol over several cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ramesh Vinayak |url=http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=23412&amp;sectionid=4&amp;issueid=85&amp;Itemid=1 |title=Pak jet fighters continue flying over Lahore for 2nd day |publisher=indiatoday.digitaltoday.in |date=23 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taliban]] and affiliated groups openly declared their solidarity with [[Pakistan]]. The banned [[Tehrik-e-Taliban]] had proclaimed that they would send "thousands of (their) well-armed [[Militant (word)|militants]]" in order to wage [[jihad]] against [[India]] if war should break out. Hundreds of would-be bombers were equipped with suicide jackets and explosive-laden vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-23/pakistan/27943286_1_baitullah-mehsud-pak-army-taliban | work=The Times Of India | title=Taliban to back Pak army in case of hostilities with India | date=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December, P.K. Barbora, the air officer commanding-in-chief of Western Air Command, said "[t]he IAF has earmarked 5,000 targets in Pakistan.

On 25 December, however, the ruling UPA government in India played down apprehensions of an imminent military conflagration. The Indian Prime Minister made it clear that "nobody wanted war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-25/india/27892218_1_nca-india-and-pakistan-nuclear-doctrine | work=The Times Of India | first1=Rajat | last1=Pandit | title=PM led N-Command meeting on Saturday | date=25 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Air Force also downplayed the sorties by PAF fighter jets, saying it was an air defence exercise.

Pakistan continued deployment, and moved the 10th Brigade to the outskirts of [[Lahore]], and the 3rd Armored Brigade to [[Jhelum]].

On 30 December, Pakistani media stated: "The service chiefs of all of the branches of India's military were told to stay in the country in order to achieve 'complete readiness'. All units that are on exercises have been ordered to remain so indefinitely, and to indicate any equipment or ammunition they need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\12\30\story_30-12-2008_pg1_4 |title=Indian services chiefs told to stay in country, troops on alert|publisher=Dailytimes.com.pk |date=30 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not backed by Indian nor international media.

===Trials in Pakistan===
Indian and Pakistani police had exchanged DNA evidence, photographs, and items found with the attackers, to piece together a detailed portrait of the Mumbai plot. Police in Pakistan had arrested seven people, including Hammad Amin Sadiq, a homoeopathic pharmacist, who arranged bank accounts and secured supplies, and he and six others began their formal trial on 3 October 2009, in Pakistan, though Indian authorities say the prosecution stopped well short of top Lashkar leaders.&lt;ref name="nytfearnewmumbai"&gt;{{cite news|last=Polgreen |first=Lydia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/world/asia/30mumbai.html |title=Officials Fear New Mumbai-Style Attack, Lydia Polgreen and Souad Mekhennet, New York Times, 30 September 2009 |location=Pakistan;Mumbai (India) |work=The New York Times |date=3 October 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119160509/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/world/asia/30mumbai.html |archivedate=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on the United States===
US officials feared that should the firm evidence emerge that the Mumbai terror attacks were planned and directed from within Pakistan, it would certainly escalate tension between the neighbouring countries, and could also provoke an Indian military response, even strikes against terrorists, a media report said on Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Mumbai-attack-may-trigger-Indian-military-response/392202/| title= Mumbai attack may trigger Indian military response’| date= 29 November 2008| accessdate= 1 December 2008| work= Indian Express| location= India| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202112806/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Mumbai-attack-may-trigger-Indian-military-response/392202/| archivedate= 2 December 2008| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], on Monday, urged Pakistan to give its "absolute, total" cooperation in finding those responsible for last week's attacks on Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-36810120081201

Bush, in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. She said that there is need for "direct and tough action" by Islamabad, even if the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks were "non-state actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075131&amp;type=News| title= Rice urges Pakistan for 'direct and tough action' against Mumbai attackers| date= 3 December 2008| accessdate= 5 December 2008| publisher= [[NDTV]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206033521/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075131&amp;type=News| archivedate= 6 December 2008| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Secretary Rice's visit to India is a further demonstration of the United States' commitment to stand in solidarity with the people of India, as we all work together to hold these extremists accountable", White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed2/idUSTRE4B005O20081201

After visiting India, Condoleezza Rice travelled to Pakistan on 4 December 2008, to talk with the Pakistani government. She is quoted as saying, "We talked at length about the importance of Pakistan taking its responsibility to deal with those who may use Pakistan territory even if they are non-state actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, some of the most wanted names on the list continue to operate openly in Pakistan. No action has been taken against them by the government of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="HafizOpen"&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-pakistan-militants_barkerdec07,0,706488.story Mumbai suspect lives freely in Pakistan, Kim Barker, Chicago Tribune, 07-Dec-2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Police forces in places like New York and Boston practised handling of similar situations, should they occur in the US.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Impact on the United Kingdom===
In the wake of the attacks, a new system of compensation for UK citizens caught up in terrorist attacks is being considered. However, "currently the UK government does not guarantee compensation for people injured in attacks abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8059148.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Battle to compensate terror victims | date=22 May 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010 | first=Tom | last=Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK police feared similar attacks could occur in the country.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Citizens' movements===
The Mumbai attack also triggered a chain of citizens' movements across India. People from all walks of life hit the streets with candles and placards to pay tributes to the victims of the tragedy almost every weekend after the 26/11 incident. While NSG commandos, Mumbai police officials, hotel staffers, etc. who participated in the operation to eliminate the terrorists became overnight heroes, the wrath of the citizens was directed towards the Government's inability to ensure adequate security to its citizens, and soon led to the chain of resignations, including that of the Indian Home Minister, [[Shivraj Patil]]. The gathering of citizens at the [[Gateway of India]] in Mumbai was unprecedented and historic. From [[India Gate]] and [[Jantar Mantar]] in [[New Delhi]] to marketplaces and street corners all across the country, India witnessed candlelight vigils by the common people. Some organised initiatives to carry forward the citizens' movement included a [[Hindustan Times]]-[[CNN-IBN]] Initiative, [[India Today]] Group's War Against Terror, and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100610/http://www.hindustanhamara.org/ Hindustan Hamara Citizens' Initiative], besides a large number of blogs on the issue.

===February 2009 video release===
On 25 February 2009, new videos were released off of CCTV, displaying the inside of the hotel where the Mumbai siege took place.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3010">The '''Aspurgiani''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀσπουργιανοί}} or {{lang|grc|Ἀσπουγγιτανοί}}) were an ancient people, a tribe of the [[Maeotae]] dwelling along east side of the [[Strait of Kerch]] along the [[Palus Maeotis]] in antiquity. They seem to be identical with the "[[Asturicani]]" of [[Ptolemy]] (v. 9. § 7).

The Aspurgiani inhabited the region called [[Sindica]], between [[Phanagoria]] and [[Gorgippia]], among the Maeotae, [[Sindi (people)|Sindi]], [[Dandarii]], [[Toreatae]], [[Agri (Maeotae)|Agri]], [[Arrechi]], [[Tarpetes]], [[Obidiaceni]], [[Sittaceni]] and [[Dosci]], among others. (Strab. xi. 2. 11). They were among the Maeotic tribes whom King [[Polemon I of Pontus]] and [[Bosporan kingdom|the Bosporus]], in the reign of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]], attempted to subdue; however, they took him prisoner and put him to death. (Strab. xi. p. 495, xii. p. 556; [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. B.]] ''s. v.''; see Ritter's speculations on the name, in connection with the origin of the name of Asia, Vorhalle, pp. 296, foil.). 

Scholars often attribute artifacts found in the Bosporus and Gorgippia, which featured the [[Solar deity|Sun god]] or its symbols, to the Aspurgiani tribes, indicating their Iranian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intangible Spirits and Graven Images: The Iconography of Deities in the Pre-Islamic Iranian World|last=Shaked|first=Shaul|last2=Bhayro|first2=Siam|publisher=BRILL|year=2014|isbn=9789004281486|location=Leiden|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tribes were first mentioned in Strabo's works as the group who killed Polemo when he launched a treacherous attack.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scythians and Greeks: A Survey of Ancient History and Archaeology on the North Coast of the Euxine from the Danube to the Caucasus|last=Minns|first=Ellis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9781108024877|location=Cambridge|pages=128, 594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=FSRPCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT329&amp;dq=Aspurgiani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB5NGi4NPeAhWBa7wKHSGMBG8Q6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Aspurgiani&amp;f=false|title=The Geography of Strabo : Volume II (Illustrated)|last=Strabo|date=2014-04-07|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781312078659|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Companion to Strabo|last=Dueck|first=Daniela|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781317445852|location=London|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account cited that these tribes were more of a political party or a military colony rather than a tribe, having been founded by a person called [[Tiberius Julius Aspurgus|Aspurgus]], who once was a king of the [[Bosporan Kingdom|Bosporan kingdom]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Bonito Phase''' is an archeological term that refers to the period between 900 and 1140 CE, during which the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] in the [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]] area constructed numerous [[Great house (pueblo)|great house]]s. The system is divided into three parts: the '''Early Bonito phase''' from 900 to 1040; the '''Classic Bonito phase''' from 1040 to 1100, and the '''Late Bonito phase''' from 1100 to 1140. When the system was created in the 1980s, it was thought that construction at [[Pueblo Bonito]] began around 920, but it is now known that building at the great house started almost one hundred years earlier, {{circa|850}}.{{sfn|Vivian|Hilpert|2012|p=72}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10354">'''Brewster Color''' was an early [[subtractive color]]-model [[film]] process.

A [[RG color space|two color]] process was invented by Percy Douglas Brewster in 1913, based on the earlier work of [[William Friese-Greene]].&lt;ref name="Silent Cinema"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Silent Cinema |last=Cherchi Usai |first=Paolo |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |year=2000 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It attempted to compensate for previous methods' problems with [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].&lt;ref name=Way&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrYaytLfSJYC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127 |title=The Way of All Flesh Tones: A History of Color Motion Picture Processes, 1895-1929 |last=Nowotny |first=Robert Allen |pages=127-129 |date=January 1, 1983 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewster introduced a three color process in 1935, in an unsuccessful attempt to compete with [[Technicolor]].&lt;ref name="Silent Cinema"/&gt;

==Two color process==
In his first [[patent application]], filed February 11, 1913, American inventor Percy Douglas Brewster described a new color film process:
{{quote|The exposure is made through a ray filter, preferably light yellow in color and adapted to cut off all the violet and ultra-violet rays of light. The green and blue light with the addition of some yellow, after passing through the ray filter, acts upon the panchromatic emulsion on the front of the film, while the red and orange light with some yellow passes through the film and acts upon the panchromatic emulsion on the back of the film. The color that the transparent emulsion is stained prevents the passage of a substantial amount of blue and green light through the film to act upon the panchromatic film on the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Brewster_US000001191941A.pdf |title=Patent 1,191,941 - Color Photography |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=July 25, 1916 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Over the next eight years, Brewster filed a series of further [[patent]]s pertaining to photographic film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Brewster_US000001145968A.pdf |title=Patent 1,145,968 - Photographic Film |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=July 13, 1915 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photographic processing|film development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Brewster_US000001145968A.pdf |title=Patent 1,410,884 - Differential Development of Color Cinematographic Films |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=March 28, 1922 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Brewster_US000001563959A.pdf |title=Patent 1,563,959 - Printing Color Cinematographic Films |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=December 1, 1925 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; color cinematography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Bi-pack_US000001222925A.pdf |title=Patent 1,222,925 - Film For Color Cinematography |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=April 17, 1917 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Brewster_US000001359025A.pdf |title=Patent 1,359,025 - Apparatus For Color Cinematography |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=November 16, 1920 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Brewster_US000001359024A.pdf |title=Patent 1,359,024 - Method For Color Cinematography |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=November 16, 1920 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Brewster_US000001752477A.pdf |title=Patent 1,752,477 - Camera For Color Cinematography |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=April 1, 1930 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various improvements to the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Brewster_US000001508916A.pdf |title=Patent 1,508,916 - Color Photography |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=September 16, 1924 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brewster_Brewster_US000001537524A.pdf |title=Patent 1,537,524 - Coloring or Dyeing Photographic Images |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=May 12, 1925 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917, a patent for a method of "Coloring or Dyeing Photographic Images" was issued to Hoyt Miller, chief chemist of the Brewster Color Film Corporation, and [[Transfer (patent)|assigned]] to the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1916/03/26/archives/new-color-photography-process-perfected-two-young-inventors-make.html |title=New Color Photography Process Perfected; Two Young Inventors Make Pictures in Natural Hues and Take as Many Prints as They Desire from One Exposure |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=75 |subscription=yes |date=March 26, 1916 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Miller_Brewster_US000001214940A.pdf |title=Patent 1,214,940 - Coloring or Dyeing Photographic Images |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |date=February 6, 1917 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUCNBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA346&amp;lpg=PA346 |title=History of Color Photography |last=Friedman |first=Joseph Solomon |publisher=American Photographic Publishing Co. |page=346 |year=1944 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in motion pictures===
Brewster's process was used for the first color [[animated cartoon]], 1920's ''[[The Debut of Thomas Cat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjmNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=46 |title=A/V A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment, and Other Audiovisual Terms |last=Kroon |first=Richard W. |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]] |year=2010 |isbn=9780786444052 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2TEEaCrPiWsC&amp;pg=PT326&amp;lpg=PT326 |title=Robertson's Book of Firsts: Who Did What for the First Time |last=Robertson |first=Patrick |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |page=326 |date=November 11, 2011 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However the production company, [[Bray Productions|Bray Pictures]], deemed the process to be too expensive, and did not employ it again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaeJFVTedysC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160 |title=Before Mickey: The Animated Film 1898-1928 |last=Crafton |first=Donald |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |pages=160–161 |isbn=0226116670 |date=December 15, 1993 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As other color processes became available, Brewster Color continued to be preferred by some filmmakers due to its relatively low cost and greater availability for small production runs.  It began to fall out of use in the late 1920s, in favor of the [[Prizma]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/nontheatrical/docs/motion_pictures_not_for_theaters |title=Motion Pictures – Not For Theatres |last=Krows |first=Arthur Edwin |work=The Educational Screen |page=152 |date=April 1941 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1944, a syndicate was formed to purchase the rights to the Brewster Color process and use it to produce films at studios in New York and Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdail85wids/filmdail85wids_djvu.txt |title=Erect First Studio Here To Make Tele Color Pix |work=[[Film Daily]] |date=April 10, 1944 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturedai55unse_0/motionpicturedai55unse_0_djvu.txt |title=Form Syndicate to Buy Color Process |work=Motion Picture Daily |date=April 7, 1944 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanley Neal, member of the syndicate and owner of its laboratory, was mainly known for the production of [[industrial film]]s and advertising [[Short film|shorts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byQ8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90 |title=Product Placement in Hollywood Films: A History |last=Segrave |first=Kerry |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]] |pages=90–91 |isbn=0786419040 |date=July 13, 2004 |accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three color process==
In 1935, Brewster introduced a three color process which added yellow tinting.  Though demonstration films received praise from members of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] for their "remarkable steadiness" and "extraordinarily good reds", this method failed to meet with commercial success.&lt;ref name="Silent Cinema"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Way/&gt;

==''Brewster v. Technicolor''==
Brewster filed a lawsuit against [[Technicolor, Inc.]] and Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation on April 1, 1941.  It sought $100,000 in damages and an [[injunction]], stating that they had [[Patent infringement|infringed]] on patents for a "method and apparatus for color cinematography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturedai49unse_0/motionpicturedai49unse_0_djvu.txt |title=Technicolor Sued Over Color Patent |work=Motion Picture Daily |date=April 2, 1941 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, 1941, the judge overruled defense objections to some of the plaintiff's [[interrogatories]]. This procedural decision has been cited in some subsequent cases, as "2 [[Federal Rules Decisions|F.R.D.]] 186, 51 U.S.P.Q. 319".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Federal Rules Decisions]] |volume=2 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No further public filings were made by Brewster, suggesting that the case may have been settled out of court.

[[Image:Hérodote.jpg|thumb|Budé edition of [[Herodotus]] 2.69-70, on the hunting of crocodiles. Note the original is printed on the right-hand side (called "page directrice"), not on the left as in the Loeb series]]
The '''''Collection Budé''''', or the '''''Collection des Universités de France''''', is an [[Collection (publishing)|editorial collection]] comprising the [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Latin]] classics up to the middle of the 6th century (before Emperor Justinian). It is published by [[Les Belles Lettres]], and is sponsored by the [[Association Guillaume Budé]].

Each title of the series includes an introduction, notes and a [[critical apparatus]], as well as a facing-page [[French language|French]] translation, comparable to the [[Loeb Classical Library]] in the English-speaking world, but with considerably more detailed introductions, apparatus, and critical or explanatory annotations. Some titles even comprise full-scale commentaries. The Greek authors in the series can be recognized by a yellow cover on which [[Owl of Athena|Athena's little owl]] can be seen, the Latin ones by a red one where one finds a she-wolf reminiscent of the [[Capitoline Wolf]]. A new series, called "Classiques en poche" and aimed at students, has been added: it reproduces the text and translation of the standard editions, but without the critical apparatus.

The first Budé volume, [[Plato]]'s ''[[Hippias Minor|Hippias Mineur]]'', was published in 1920. Soon afterwards appeared the first Latin work of the series, namely [[Lucretius]]' ''[[On the Nature of Things|De rerum natura]]'', edited by Alfred Ernout. More than 800 volumes of the series have been published, with the Greek authors (about 430 vol.) outnumbering the Latin ones (about 370 vol.). Both [[paganism|pagan]] authors and [[Church Fathers]] are included although, for the latter, the Sources Chrétiennes series (Éditions du Cerf, Paris), comprising both Greek and Latin authors, are much more complete.

'''Cudjoe Kazoola Lewis''' (c. 1840 – July 17, 1935), or '''Cudjo Lewis''' or '''Oluale Kossola,'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1403|title=Cudjo Lewis|last=Diouf|first=Sylviane A.|date=20 October 2009|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the last known survivor of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] between Africa and the United States. Together with 115 other African captives, he was brought illegally to the United States on board the ship ''[[Clotilda (slave ship)|Clotilda]]'' in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historic Sketches of the South|last=Roche|first=Emma Langdon|publisher=Knickerbocker Press|year=1914|isbn=|location=New York|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were landed in the backwaters near [[Mobile, Alabama]], and hidden from authorities. The ship was [[scuttling|scuttled]] to evade discovery.

After the Civil War, Lewis and other members of the ''Clotilda'' group became free and established a community at Magazine Point, north of Mobile, Alabama. Now designated as the [[Africatown]] Historic District, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-africatown-20150606-story.html|title=American slaves' origins live on in Alabama's Africatown|last=Teague|first=Matthew|date=June 6, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 27, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In old age Lewis preserved the experiences of the ''Clotilda'' captives by providing accounts of the history of the group to visitors, including Mobile artist and author [[Emma Langdon Roche]] and author and folklorist [[Zora Neale Hurston]].

==Early life and enslavement==
[[File:Map of Cudjo Lewis' Capture in Africa.jpg|left|thumb|Map drawn by Cudjo Lewis for Emma Langdon Roche to illustrate his capture.]]
He was born as Kossola or Oluale Kossola (American listeners would later transcribe his given name as "Kazoola"), around 1840 in West Africa. Analyzing names and the other words attributed to the Africatown founders, historian [[Sylviane Diouf]] has concluded that he and many other members of the community belonged to what is now known as the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] [[ethnic group]], and lived in the [[Bantè|Banté]] region of what is now [[Benin]]. His father was named Oluwale (or Oluale) and his mother Fondlolu; he had five full siblings and twelve half-siblings, the children of his father's other two wives.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa'', pp. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers Roche and Hurston, and those who used their work, referred to Lewis and his fellow-captives as "Tarkars." Diouf believes that the term "Tarkar" might have come from a misunderstanding of the name of a local king, or the name of a town.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

During April or May 1860, Lewis was taken prisoner by the army of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] as part of its annual dry-season raids for slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Diuof, ''Dreams of Africa'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Africa's Ogun: Old World and New (2nd ed.)|last=Barnes|first=Sandra T., ed.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0253210838|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other captives, he was taken to the slaving port of [[Ouidah]] and sold to Captain William Foster of the ''Clotilda'', a ship based in [[Mobile, Alabama]], and owned by businessman Timothy Meaher. Although importation of enslaved persons into the United States had been illegal since 1808, Meaher may have believed that he could flout the law without consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/question/july05/index.htm|title=Question of the Month: Cudjo Lewis: Last Slave in the US?|last=Pilgrim|first=David|date=June 2005|website=Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia|publisher=Ferris State University|access-date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports suggest that breaking the law was part of Meaher's motivation for importing the slaves, as he reportedly bet a businessman $100,000 that he could circumvent the prohibition on transporting slaves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/barracoon-cudjo-lewis-zora-neale-hurston-last-slave-ship-survivor-book-life-story-published-a8335776.html|title=Story of the last survivor of the last slave ship to travel from Africa to US is published after 87 years|date=2018-05-04|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar situation, the owners of the ''[[Wanderer (slave ship)|Wanderer,]]'' which had illegally brought a cargo of enslaved people to Georgia in 1858, were indicted and tried for piracy in the federal court in Savannah in May 1860 but acquitted in a jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/wanderer|title=Wanderer|last=Rohrer|first=Katherine E.|date=June 18, 2010|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|publisher=Georgia Humanities Council &amp; University of Georgia Press|access-date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the ''Clotilda'' reached the Mississippi coast in July 1860, government officials had been alerted to its activities, and Timothy Meaher, his brother Burns, and their associate John Dabney were charged with illegal possession of the captives. However, there was a gap of almost five months between the end of July 1860, when summonses and writs of seizure were issued against the Meahers and Dabney, and mid-December when they received them. During the intervening period the captives were dispersed and hidden, and without their physical presence as evidence the case was dismissed in January 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/atlanta/finding-aids/clotilda.pdf|title=The Clotilda: A Finding Aid|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Archives at Atlanta|access-date=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/loc.afc.afc-legacies.200002671/default.html|title=AfricaTown USA|last=|first=|date=2000|website=Local Legacies: Celebrating Community Roots|publisher=Library of Congress American Folklife Center|access-date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861–65), Lewis and his fellows lived as ''de facto'' slaves of Meaher, his brothers, or their associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dreams of Africa, ''chapter 4''.|last=Diouf|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|nopp=|chapter=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis was purchased by James Meaher, for whom he worked as a deckhand on a steamer.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa'', pp. 86, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he became known as "Cudjo Lewis." He later explained that he suggested "Cudjo," a [[Akan names#Day names|day-name]] commonly given to boys born on a Monday, as an alternative to his given name when James Meaher had difficulty pronouncing "Kossola." Historian Diouf posits that the surname "Lewis" was a corruption of his father's name Oluale, sharing the "lu" sound; in his homeland, the closest analogue to what Americans understood as a surname would have been a [[patronymic]].&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa'', pp. 92, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in Africatown ==

=== Establishment of Africatown ===

[[File:Cudjoe Abache.jpg|thumb|Cudjo Kazoola Lewis photographed with Abache (Clara Turner) by Emma Roche, c. 1914. By then there were eight surviving members of the ''Clotilda'' group.]]

During their time in slavery, Lewis and many of the other ''Clotilda'' captives were located at an area north of Mobile known as Magazine Point, the Plateau, or "Meaher's hammock," where the Meahers owned a mill and a shipyard. Although only three miles from the town of Mobile, it was isolated, separated from the city by a swamp and a forest, and easily accessible only by water. After the [[Abolition of slavery in the United States|abolition of slavery]] and the end of the Civil War, the ''Clotilda'' captives tried to raise money to return to their homeland. The men worked in lumber mills and the women raised and sold produce, but these occupations did not allow them to acquire sufficient funds.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, ''Historic Sketches'', pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt; After realizing that they would not be able to return to Africa, the group deputized Lewis to ask Timothy Meaher for a grant of land. When he refused, the members of the community continued to raise money and began to purchase land around Magazine Point.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, ''Historic Sketches,'' pp. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 1872, Lewis bought about two acres of land in the Plateau area for $100.00.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africatown]] developed as a self-contained community. The group appointed leaders to enforce communal norms derived from their shared African background, and developed institutions including a church, a school, and a cemetery. Diouf explains that Africatown was unique because it was both a "black town," inhabited exclusively by people of African ancestry, and an enclave of people born in another country. She writes, "Black towns were safe havens from racism, but African Town was a refuge from Americans."&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa,'' pp. 157, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1914, Emma Langdon Roche noted that the surviving founders of Africatown preferred to speak in their own language among themselves. She described the English of adults as "very broken and not always intelligible even to those who have lived among them for many years."&lt;ref&gt;Roche, ''Historic Sketches'', pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the residents also adopted some American customs, including Christianity. Lewis converted in 1869, joining a Baptist church.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa,'' p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elick Lewis grave (CS's son).jpg|left|thumb|Grave of Aleck/Elick Lewis, whose father, Cudjoe and mother, Abile "Celia" were among the last Africans brought to the United States through the Atlantic slave trade, in the Plateau Cemetery, Africatown, Mobile.]]

=== Marriage and family life ===
During the mid-1860s Lewis established a common-law relationship with another ''Clotilda'' survivor, Abile (Americanized as "Celia"). They formally married on March 15, 1880, along with several other couples from Africatown. They remained together until Abile's death in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa'', pp. 136, 180, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

They had six children, five sons and a daughter, to each of whom they gave both an African name and an American name.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their eldest son, Aleck (or Elick) Iyadjemi, became a grocer; he brought his wife to live in a house on his father's land. Diouf describes this arrangement as a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]-style "family compound." Another son, Cudjoe Feïchtan, was fatally shot by a sheriff's deputy in 1902.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lewis outlived all of his children as well as his wife. He allowed his daughter-in-law Mary Wood Lewis, his grandchildren, and eventually her second husband Joe Lewis (no relation) to remain in their house in the compound.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa,'' pp. 217-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis worked as a farmer and laborer until 1902, when his buggy was damaged and he was injured in a collision with a train in Mobile. As he was then unable to work, the community appointed him as sexton of the church. In 1903 it took the name of the [[Union Missionary Baptist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa,'' p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Participation in American institutions ===
Although native-born American former slaves became citizens upon the passage of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in July 1868, this change in status did not apply to the members of the ''Clotilda'' group, who were foreign-born. Cudjo Kazoola Lewis became a [[Naturalization|naturalized American citizen]] on October 24, 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa,'' p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis utilized the American legal system in 1902 after his injury in the buggy-train collision. After the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] refused to pay damages, he hired an attorney, sued the railroad, and won a significant settlement of $650.00. The award was overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa,'' pp. 211-214.&lt;/ref&gt;{{why|date=May 2018}}

== Role as storyteller and historian ==
In the first quarter of the 20th century, Lewis began to serve as an informant for scholars and other writers, sharing the history of the ''Clotilda'' Africans and traditional stories and tales. Emma Langdon Roche, a Mobile-based writer and artist, interviewed Lewis and the other survivors for her 1914 book ''Historic Sketches of the South.'' She described their capture in Africa, enslavement, and lives in Africatown. They requested that she use their African names in her work, in the hope that it might reach their homeland "where some might remember them."&lt;ref&gt;Roche, ''Historic Sketches'', pp. 120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1925, Lewis was the last African survivor of the ''Clotilda;'' he was interviewed by educator and folklorist [[Arthur Fauset|Arthur Huff Fauset]] of Philadelphia. In 1927 Fauset published two of Lewis' animal tales, "[[Terrapin|T'appin's]] magic dipper and whip" and "T'appin fooled by Billy Goat's eyes," and "Lion Hunt," his autobiographical account about hunting in Africa, in the ''Journal of American Folklore.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fauset|first=Arthur Huff|date=July–September 1927|title=Negro Folk Tales from the South (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana)|url=|journal=Journal of American Folklore|volume=40|pages=213–303|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detail of Cudjoe Lewis marker.jpg|thumb|Detail of commemorative marker for Cudjo Lewis, Plateau Cemetery, Africatown, Mobile.]]

In 1927 Lewis was interviewed by the folklorist [[Zora Neale Hurston]]. The next year she published an article, "Cudjoe's Own Story of the Last African Slaver" (1928). According to her biographer Robert E. Hemenway, this piece largely plagiarized Emma Roche's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Biography|last=Hemenway|first=Robert E.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0252008078|location=Urbana and Chicago, IL|pages=96–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Hurston added information about daily life in Lewis' home village of Banté.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurston|first=Zora Neale|date=October 1927|title=Cudjoe's Own Story of the Last African Slaver|url=|journal=Journal of Negro History|volume=12|pages=648–663|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Hurston returned with additional resources; she conducted more interviews, took photographs, and recorded what is the only known film footage of an African who had been trafficked to the United States through the slave trade. Based on this material, she wrote a manuscript, ''Barracoon,'' which Hemenway described as "a highly dramatic, semifictionalized narrative intended for the popular reader."&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway, ''Zora Neale Hurston'', pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diouf, p. 225"&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa'', p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; After this round of interviews, Hurston's literary patron, philanthropist [[Charlotte Osgood Mason]], learned of Lewis and began to send him money for his support.&lt;ref name="Diouf, p. 225"/&gt; Lewis was also interviewed by journalists for local and national publications.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, ''Dreams of Africa'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston's book ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last Black Cargo]]'' was finally published on May 8, 2018.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Little|first1=Becky|title=The Last Slave Ship Survivor Gave an Interview in the 1930s.

== Legacy ==
Cudjo Lewis died July 17, 1935, and was buried at the Plateau Cemetery in Africatown. Since his death, his status as the last survivor of the ''Clotilda'' and the written record created by his interviewers have made him a public figure of the history of the community.

*In 1959 a memorial bust of Lewis was erected in front of Africatown's Union Missionary Baptist Church atop a pyramid of bricks made by the ''Clotilda'' captives. It was made on behalf of the Progressive League of Africatown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=20020108&amp;id=XrovAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=79wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6333,751302&amp;hl=en|title=Bust of Last Survivor of Slave Ship "Clotilde" stolen in Mobile|last=|first=|date=January 8, 2002|work=Gadsden Times|access-date=May 27, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2211&amp;dat=19590912&amp;id=yf0mAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9AIGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1268,3536510&amp;hl=en|title=Capital Spotlight|last=Lautier|first=Lewis|date=September 12, 1959|work=The Afro-American|access-date=May 27, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2007 two African filmmakers donated a bust of Lewis to the Africatown Welcome Center.

York began his ministry in the late 1960s. In 1967 he was preaching to the "[[Afrocentric views on race|Ansaaru Allah]]" ([[viz.]] African Americans) in [[Brooklyn]], New York, during the period of the [[Black Power]] movement. He founded numerous orders under various names during the 1970s and 1980s. These were at first based on pseudo-[[Islam]]ic themes and Judaism (Nubian Islamic Hebrews). Later he developed a theme derived from "[[ancient Egypt in Afrocentrism|Ancient Egypt]]," mixing ideas taken from [[black nationalism]], [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] and [[UFO religions]], and popular [[conspiracy theory]]. He last called his group the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, or Nuwabians.

York and the Nuwaubians came under scrutiny in the early 1990s, after they built ''[[Tama-Re]],'' an Egyptian-themed "city" for about a hundred of his followers, in rural [[Putnam County, Georgia]]. Before York's trial, the community had been joined directly and in the area by hundreds of other followers from out of state, while alienating both black and white local residents. The community was intensively investigated after numerous reports that York had molested numerous children of his followers.

York was arrested in May 2002. In 2004 he was convicted on federal charges of transporting minors across state lines for the purposes of sexual molestation, as well as racketeering and financial reporting violations. York's case was reported as the largest prosecution for child molestation ever directed at a single person in the history of the United States, both in terms of number of victims and number of incidents.

"Affidavit of confirmation of true birth records of Malachi Kobina York/Yorke by myself his biological mother," 19 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

York says that he was raised in [[Massachusetts]], and at the age of seven went to [[Aswan]], [[Egypt]] to learn about [[Islam]]. "My grandfather, As Sayyid Abdur Rahman Al Mahdi, the [[Imaam]] of the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansaar]]s in the [[Sudan]] until 1959 AD, upon looking into my eyes foretold that I was the one who would possess 'the light.'"&lt;ref name=written4&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050211144447/http://factology.com/doc/written4.htm Malachi Z. York, ''The Ansaar Cult, Rebuttal to the Slanderers'', Factology website,  archived by the Internet Archive in Feb. 2005];&lt;/ref&gt; He says he returned to the United States in 1957 at age 12 and continued to study Islam. As an adolescent, he moved with his family to [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].

In the late 1960s York, calling himself "Imaam Isa", combined elements of the [[Moorish Science Temple of America]], the [[Nation of Islam]], the [[Nation of Gods and Earths]] and [[Freemasonry]], and founded a quasi-[[Muslim]] [[black nationalist]] movement and community. He called it "Ansaar Pure Sufi," or the "Ansaaru Allah Community," c. 1970.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-1841900061.html Carol Brennan, "York, Dwight D."], ''Encyclopedia.com,'' 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He instructed members to wear black and green [[dashiki]]s.&lt;ref name="Philips1" /&gt;

He later changed his name to "Imaam Isa Abdullah," and renamed his "Ansaar Pure Sufi" ministry to the "Nubians" in [[Brooklyn]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="Philips1" /&gt; The group was considered to be part of the [[Black Hebrews]] phenomenon, under the name "Nubian Islaamic Hebrews". Unlike other groups, they were not Judeo-Christian but Judeo-Islamic.&lt;ref name="Philips3"&gt;Philips, Abu Ameenah Bilal. ''The Ansar Cult in America'' Tawheed Publications, 1988, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and "Nubian Hebrew Mission" as of 1969&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040112154127/http://home.att.net/~spmckee/mckee_muslimglossary.htm Glossary from McKee, Susan, "A Provisional History of Muslims in the United States" (work-in-progress), as archived by the Internet Archive, Jan. 2004];&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the period of Black Power among some African Americans.

===Ansaaru Allah Community (1970)===
York later traveled to Africa, to [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] in particular. He met and persuaded members of [[Mohamed Ahmed Al-Mahdi]]'s family to finance him to set up a cell of their organization in the United States. This was to be a "west" or "American" political wing of Sudan's [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] movement under [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]] (also see [[Umma Party (Sudan)|Umma Party]]). He began to develop the claim of his "Sudanese" roots  in order to authenticate his American branch of the sect.&lt;ref name="Philips1" /&gt;

After York returned from a pilgrimage to ([[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]), he invited Sadiq Al-Mahdi to the US. In 1970 his group changed its name to the "Ansaaru Allah Community in the West."&lt;ref name="Ourstory"&gt;[http://www.inetmgrs.com/onepeoples/Ansaar.htm "Ansaaru Allah Nubian Islamic Hebrews: Ourstory!"],  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6eMyim1gD?url=http://www.inetmgrs.com/onepeoples/Ansaar.htm |date=January 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1993 [[FBI]] report described this group as a "front for a wide range of criminal activity, including arson, [[welfare fraud]] and [[extortion]]."&lt;ref name="watchman.org"&gt;[http://www.watchman.org/index-of-cults-and-religions/#AncientMysticOrder "Ancient Mystic Order of Malchizedek], Index of Cults and Religions", [[Watchman Fellowship|Watchman Fellowship ministry]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The women of the Ansaaru Allah Community focus on memorizing history as their [[Imam]] sees it, learning [[Arabic]] (many of them are quite fluent), incorporating Sudanese etiquette into their mannerisms and memorizing the [[Qur'an]]. They participate in the compilation of the various texts produced by the community and also work in the recording studio owned by the community. Other than this work, the women's main source of income comes from US government public assistance and monies earned by the men in various enterprises such as food shops, jewelry and merchandise stores, and street vending.&lt;ref name="Ourstory" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Brooklyn (1980–1993)===
The ''[[New York Press]]'' reported on York:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was based in [[Coney Island]] for a time, and operated a bookstore and a printing press on Flatbush Ave. in the 70s. In the 80s he was based in Brooklyn, on Bushwick Ave. York's students are best remembered by New Yorkers as practitioners of orthodox Islam – members of certain New York [[Five Percent Nation]], [[Nation of Islam]] and [[Arab]] Islamic mosques still regard the Nuwaubians as a rival faction – but at different times they followed the paths of Christianity and [[Judaism]]. Operations relocated to Liberty, near the [[Catskills]], around 1991, then to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="Heimlich"&gt;[http://www.nypress.com/black-egypt-a-visit-to-tama-re/ Heimlich, Adam. "Black Egypt: A Visit to Tama-Re", ''New York Press'', 14 November 2000],  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6eMzF4JT3?url=http://www.nypress.com/black-egypt-a-visit-to-tama-re/ |date=January 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The community in Brooklyn, reported as identifying as the "Holy Tabernacle of the Most High" and also as the "Children of Abraham," was said to be led by Rabboni Y'shua Bar El Haady. They practiced a mixture of Judaism and Islam. They were reported as numbering about 300 persons and in 1994 the group reportedly still owned nine apartment buildings, of which five were in tax arrears. Local politicians were concerned that the abandoned buildings would become centers of uses that would damage the neighborhood. Anecdotal reports were that some of the group went to [[Monroe County, New York]], and others to Georgia.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/nyregion/muslims-leave-bushwick-the-neighbors-ask-why.html Hevesi, Dennis. "Muslims Leave Bushwick: The Neighbors Ask Why,"] ''New York Times,'' 24 April 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Musical productions ====
In the early 1980s, York had performed as vocalist with his own groups, known as Jackie and the Starlights, the Students, and [[Passion (band)|Passion]].

He launched his own [[record label]], named Passion Productions, recording as the solo artist "Dr. York." His debut release was the single "Only a Dream" (later included in the album ''New York,'' Hot Melt Records UK, 1985). "Dr. York" and Passion Productions were advertised in the May 4, 1985 issue of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0CQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT58&amp;dq=%2BPassion+%2B%22Dr.+York%22&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=rlNjTrXzIeTQ4QTU94y6Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%2BPassion%20%2B%22Dr.%20York%22&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|publisher=Billboard|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Background vocals were by Ted Mills of the group [[Blue Magic (band)|Blue Magic]].&lt;ref&gt;"Record News", ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', December 14, 1985, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; York said he performed [[popular music]] in order to "reach a mass majority of my people through my music."&lt;ref&gt;York, Malachi Z. "El's Qur'aan 18:60–82, What It Means Today," ''The Truth (Bulletin), The 7 Heads and the 10 Horns'' (1993) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ministry and fraternal orders====
York's groups had a variety of names and functions: quasi-religious, fraternal, and tribal. They were called "Holy Tabernacle Ministries", "{{sic|Egiptian}} Church of Karast," "Holy Seed Baptist Synagogue", "Ancient Mystic Order of Melchizedek", "Ancient {{sic|Egiptian}} Order", "All Eyez on Egypt", "United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors", "Yamassee Native American Tribe", "Washitaw Tribe", and "Lodge 19 of the Ancient and Mystic Order of Malachizodok."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masonicinfo.com/york.htm |title=Malachi York |publisher=Masonic Info |date= |accessdate=2016-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6eMzuDUNF?url=http://www.masonicinfo.com/york.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all }};&lt;/ref&gt; While drawing from various religious and historical themes, Malachi York continued to focus on [[Nubia]]. He promoted a design featuring an [[ankh]] in the middle of a six-pointed star of Judaism and Islamic crescent, a symbol used by the Ansarullah Community. The ankh is associated with pre-Islamic Sudan, Nubia.

Dwight York changed his name legally in 1990 to "Issa al Haadi al Mahdi" when he was still living in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;"In the matter of the Application of Dwight York a/k/a/ Isa Muhammad, leave to change his name to Issa al Haadi al Mahdi," N.Y. Supreme Court, Brooklyn, Kings County, November 27, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He changed it again in 1993 to "Malachi York,"&lt;ref name="namechange2" /&gt; but also adopted a number of titles and pseudonyms, including "The Supreme Grand Master Dr. Malachi Z. York," "Nayya Malachizodoq-El," and "Chief Black Eagle."

By 1985 York had added miracle-performance to his repertoire. He claimed to [[Materialization (parapsychology)|materialize]] [[Vibhuti|sacred, healing ash]] in front of his followers, much in the fashion of [[Sathya Sai Baba]].&lt;ref&gt;Philips, Abu Ameenah Bilal. ''The Ansar Cult,'' 1988, p. 36 (referring to York's 1985 books ''The Man of Miracles in This Day and Time'' and ''You Are Adam's Descendants'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 York was convicted of obtaining a passport with a false [[birth certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Jalaine Ward, quoted in Peecher, Rob. "FBI: York molested dozens; grand jury indicts Nuwaubian leader on 116 state counts", ''The Macon Telegraph,'' May 14, 2002 {{cite web |url=http://www.macon.com/mld/telegraph/3257204.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020616115815/http://www.macon.com/mld/telegraph/3257204.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2002 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Georgia and construction of Tama-Re (1993–2002)===
[[Image:TamaRe.jpg|frame|The central part of the "[[Tama-Re]]" compound, as seen from the air, 2002. Photograph by Kenneth C. Budd.]]

York left Brooklyn with an estimated 300 followers about 1990. Some settled in upstate New York. He later moved with numerous followers to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Others joined them from such cities as Baltimore, Philadelphia, Hartford, New York and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt; According to former follower Robert J. Rohan, who later wrote a book about the movement, York moved in order to avoid criminal investigations and other charges in New York.&lt;ref name="crawford"&gt;[http://www.newagefraud.org/smf/index.php?topic=433.0 Sharon E. Crawford, "Former Nuwaubian writes book, tells how York duped followers," ''The Macon Telegraph,'' 14 March 2005], posted at New Age Fraud website; accessed 26 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps to avoid scrutiny from the international [[Muslim]] community, the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Gods and Earths, legal troubles, and the negative history of his group during their New York period, he changed his own name several times, as well as the group's name, and masked different parts of their doctrine.&lt;ref name="watchman.org"/&gt; In Georgia, they changed their name to the "United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors."&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;

At York's direction, the community purchased land and built ''[[Tama-Re]],'' an Egyptian-themed complex built on {{convert|476|acre|km2}} of land near [[Eatonton, Georgia]]. It was built over a period of years and completed in 1993.

Tensions with county authorities increased in 1998, when the county sought an injunction against construction and uses that violated zoning. At the same time, the Nuwaubian community increased its leafletting of Eatonton and surrounding areas, charging white officials with racial discrimination and striving to increase opposition to them. Threats mounted and an eviscerated dog carcass was left at the home of the county attorney.&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt;

Within Putnam County, the Nuwaubians lost black support, in part by trying to take over the NAACP chapter. But outside, they appealed to activists, claiming to be persecuted in the county. During this period, the group maintained Holy Tabernacle stores "in more than a dozen cities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Trinidad."&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt;  And York purchased a $557,000 mansion in [[Athens, Georgia]], about 60 miles away, the base of the University of Georgia.&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt;

In July 1999, ''[[Time magazine]]'' reported on the "40-ft. pyramids, obelisks, gods, goddesses and a giant sphinx," built by York's followers in rural Georgia in an article titled "Space Invaders".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/nuwaubians/nuwaubians176.html Joe Kovac Jr., "New Book Asks Provocative Questions About Dwight York"], ''The Macon Telegraph,'' 20 May 2007, accessed 25 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 federal government officials acquired the property of Tama-Re through [[asset forfeiture]] after York was convicted and sentenced to prison for 135 years. He owed money for violating financial laws. After the property was sold, new owners demolished the buildings and monuments.

=== Arrest and conviction of child molestation (2002-present)===
Beginning in Brooklyn, York had established strict sexual practices within the community, reserving for himself sexual access to many women and girls, including wives and children of followers.

Theodore Gabriel wrote about these practices:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hile extolling the virtues and importance of family life and the conjugal relationship, he [York] denies such relationships to his followers except at strictly controlled intervals. He urges his female followers to pattern themselves on the Islamic paradigms of the wife and the mother, apparently desiring the creation of stable family units. But in reality the husbands and wives are [[sex segregation|segregated]] in dormitories, separated also from their children. York permits spouses to cohabit only once every three months. They are permitted to meet in the "Green Room" by prior appointment only.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Theodore. "Dwight York – a religious and cultural ''bricoleur''," in Partridge, C. ''UFO Religions,'' Routledge, 2003, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anonymous letters were sent to Putnam County officials alleging child molestation at the Nuwaubian community. The FBI, which had started investigating the group in 1993, assigned a major task force to it. In 2002 York was arrested and charged with more than 100 counts of sexually molesting dozens of children, some as young as four years old. According to Bill Osinski, who wrote a 2007 book about York and the case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When he [York] was finally indicted, state prosecutors literally had to cut back the number of counts listed — from well beyond a thousand to slightly more than 200 — because they feared a jury simply wouldn't believe the magnitude of York's [[evil]].… [It] is believed to be the nation's largest child molestation prosecution ever directed at a single person, in terms of number of victims and number of alleged criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ungodlybook.com/factsheet.htm Osinski, Bill. ''Ungodly: Fact Sheet''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928215314/http://www.ungodlybook.com/factsheet.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}, ''Ungodly: A True Story of Unprecedented Evil'' book website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early 2003 York's lawyer had him evaluated by a [[forensic psychology|forensic psychologist]], who diagnosed a [[DSM-IV]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;impression consisting of Axis I – Clinical Syndrome of [[Delusional disorder|Delusional]] ([[Paranoia|Paranoid]]) Disorder, [[Generalized anxiety disorder]], [[Adjustment disorder]] with [[Depression (mood)|depressed mood]], and [[Axis II (psychology)|Axis II]] – [[personality disorders]]; [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic personality]] traits, [[Self-defeating personality disorder|self-defeating personality]] traits, and [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal personality]] features.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Matt. Attachments filed with the 2241 ''habeas corpus'' motion, 27 April  2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003, York entered into a [[plea bargain]] that was later dismissed by the judge. He was convicted by a jury on January 23, 2004. The judge rejected his plea to be returned for trial to his own "tribe," after York claimed status as an [[indigenous people|indigenous person]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your Honor, with all due respects to your government, your nation, and your court, we the indigenous people of this land have our own rights, accepted sovereign, our own governments. We are a sovereign people, [[Nuwaubianism#Yamassee|Yamassee]], [[Creek Indians|Native American Creeks]], [[Seminole]], Washitaw Mound Builders. And all I'm asking is that the Court recognize that I am an indigenous person. Your court does not have jurisdiction over me. I should be transferred to the Moors Cherokee Council Court in which I will get a trial by juries of my peers. I cannot get a fair trial, Your Honor, if I'm being tried by the settlers or the confederates. I have to be tried by Native Americans as a Native American. That's my inalienable rights, and it's on record.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v.

He asserted to the court that he was a "secured party," and answered questions in court with the response: "I accept that for value." This may have been a heterodox legal strategy based on [[patriot mythology#Legal theories|patriot mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Peecher, Rob. "Lawyer withdraws guilty plea for York: Nuwaubian leader likely to face new charges, including racketeering," ''Macon Telegraph,'' 25 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

Early in 2004, York was convicted in federal court by a jury of multiple [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]], child molestation, and financial reporting charges. He was sentenced to 135 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlineathens.com/stories/042304/new_20040423059.shtml], Online Athens, Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;

His case was appealed to the [[11th Circuit Court of Appeals]], which upheld the convictions on October 27, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Dwight D. York, a.k.a. Malakai Z.

York's followers assert a number of defenses, including that their leader Malachi Z. York, who was charged and convicted, is not the same person as the Dwight D. York who is listed in court documents as the defendant. (One of York's sons is named Dwight, and sometimes the claim is made that it is York's son and not York who is or should be the real defendant). Other say that York was "set up" by his son [[Jacob York|Jacob]] in coordination with [[al Qaeda]]-linked American mosques jealous of York's influence among black Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

York believes that his betrayal, arrest, trial and imprisonment (and eventual release) were foretold in chapter 10 of [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s ''The Wars of the Gods and the Men'', with York being represented by [[Marduk|Mar-duq]] in that story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apublicoutcry.com/h-t-m/Letters%20From%20Reverend%20York/CompilationOfPowerfulLetters.pdf York, Malachi Z.

===Imprisonment===

== Teachings ==
{{Main|Nuwaubianism}}

York has taught an ever-changing and multifaceted doctrine over the years, with influences and borrowings from many sources. It has included a baroque [[cosmology]], unconventional theories about [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and human origins, [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] and [[UFO religion|extraterrestrial speculations]], [[black nationalism]], [[conspiracy theory]], and religious practices invented or borrowed from many existing religions.

==Descent==
York has had a variety of stories about his ancestry and birth, including that he was born in [[Omdurman]], Sudan. This has not been documented. His parents of record are Mary C. York (''née'' Williams), now also known as Faatimah Maryam, and her husband David Piper York.&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt; York has claimed that his biological father was [[Al Haadi Abdur Rahman Al Mahdi]], whom his mother ostensibly met while studying as a student in the [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Chart"/&gt; This is not supported by any documentary sources.

'''Edward A. Allworth''' (1 December 1920 &amp;ndash; 20 October 2016) was an American [[historian]] specializing in [[Central Asia]]. Allwarth is widely regarded as the West’s leading scholar on Central Asian studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pannier|first1=Bruce|title=Edward Allworth: The Last of the Great Masters of Central Asian Studies|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/qishloq-ovozi-scholar-wallworth-obituary-central-asia/28073914.html|publisher=[[RFE/RL]]|accessdate=13 November 2016|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extensively studied the various ethnic groups of the region, including [[Uzbeks]], [[Tajiks]], and [[Bukharan Jews]]. He wrote numerous books on the history of Central Asia.

==Background==

Edward A. Allworth was born on December 1, 1920, the son of [[Edward Christopher Allworth|Edward Allworth]] (1895–1966) and Ethel Walker.  (His father received the Medal of Honor for service in France during World War I.)  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Memoriam: Edward A. Allworth (1920-2016)|url=http://harriman.columbia.edu/news/memoriam-edward-allworth-1920-2016|publisher=Harriman Institute at Columbia University|accessdate=13 November 2016|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his bachelor's degree from [[Oregon State University]]. He received a master's degree from the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1959, he received a Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]].

==Career==
 During World War II, Allworth served as a platoon leader, second lieutenant, and adjutant, in the [[501st Parachute Infantry Regiment]], [[101st Airborne Division]] of the US Army, in the [[Normandy Invasion]] and the division's battles thereafter through the Allied World War II victory in Northern Europe.

Allworth taught a wide variety of courses on Central Asian studies at Columbia University. In 1984, he established the Department of Middle East Languages and Cultures to focus on the study of contemporary Central Asia. He published numerous books on the history of Central Asia. These include ''Uzbek Literary Politics'' (1964), ''Central Asian Publishing and the Rise of Nationalism'' (1965), ''Central Asia: A Century of Russian Rule'' (1967), ''The Nationality Question in Soviet Central Asia'' (1973), ''Nationality Group Survival in Multiethnic States'' (1977), ''The Modern Uzbeks: From the Fourteenth Century to the Present'' (1990), ''The Tatars of Crimea: Return to the Homeland'' (1998), and ''The Preoccupations of Abdalrauf Fitrat, Bukharan Nonconformist: An Analysis and List of His Writings'' (2000).

Allworth was Emeritus Professor of Turko-Soviet Studies at [[Columbia University]]. He was founding director at Columbia of both the Program on Soviet Nationality Problems (1970) and the Center for the Study of Central Asia (1984). Allworth was also editor of the Central Asia book series at [[Duke University Press]].

==Personal life and death==

Allworth extensively studied the [[Chagatai language]]. He was fluent in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Uighur language|Uighur]].

Allworth died on October 20, 2016, in [[New York City]]. In November 2016, the Central Eurasia Studies Society posthumously awarded Allworth with the CESS Lifetime Service to the Field Award.

==Legacy==

Doctoral student [[Shahrbanou Tadjbakhsh]] remembered: &lt;blockquote&gt;Professor Allworth always defended cultural history during the [[Cold War]] when the tendency was to study strategy and weapons, as well as during the post-Soviet period, when the focus was on democracy building and economic transition models. When the Central Asian countries gained independence in the early 1990s, while some students dropped out of the PhD track to follow the appeal of rapid lucrative employment in oil companies, governments and radio stations beaming propaganda to the region, he kept a handful of us at bay and steeped us in the writings of the early 20th century reformist writer [[Abdalrauf Fitrat]], and the study of Chagatay, the 15th century pre-Uzbek language.&lt;ref name=Tadjbakhsh&gt;

'''Edward Jenks''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (1861–1939) was an English jurist, and noted writer on law and its place in history. Born on 20 February 1861 in Lambeth, London, to Robert Jenks, upholsterer, and his wife Frances Sarah, née Jones, he was educated at [[Dulwich College]] (1874-77) and [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he was scholar (1886) and, in 1889-95, fellow. He graduated B.A., LL.B. in 1886, and M.A. in 1890.  He was awarded the [[Charles Webb Le Bas#Le Bas Prize|Le Bas Prize]] and the [[Thirlwall Prize]] and was [[Chancellor's Gold Medal|chancellor's medallist]]. In 1887 he was called to the Bar and for the next two years lectured at Pembroke and Jesus colleges, Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Ruth in ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', MUP, 1983. [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jenks-edward-6837]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a brilliant law student at King's College, Cambridge and was placed first in the law [[tripos]] of 1886. He was [[Call to the Bar|called to the bar]] in 1887.

He held many seats: Director of Studies in Law and History at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] 1888-9, Dean at the faculty of law [[University of Melbourne]] 1890, [[University College, Liverpool]] 1890-92 then later to 1895 at [[Victoria University of Manchester]], reader of English at [[University of Oxford]] from 1896, and then at the [[University of London]] from 1928-1930  as a professor of English law in the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], being succeeded by [[David Hughes Parry|Sir David Hughes Parry]].

Jenks was a [[Fellow of the British Academy]]. He was a founder of the [[The Society of Legal Scholars|Society of Public Teachers of Law]] and its secretary 1909-1917.

He married first in 1890 to Annie Ingham, who died after giving birth to a son; the son would die fighting in the Great War. His second marriage in 1898 was to Dorothy Maud, a daughter of Sir [[William Bower Forwood]], with whom he had a daughter, and a son [[Jorian Jenks]].

Jenks wrote a number of books and essays dealing with law, politics and history. He was the principal editor of ''A Digest of English Civil Law'' (1905–1917) which led to receipt of an honorary doctorate from Paris. After two further editions in his lifetime (1921 and 1938), the fourth edition (1947), edited in his place by [[Percy Henry Winfield|P. H. Winfield]], retained Jenks's ''Prolegomena'', with its opening remark that a digest uses the [[indicative mood]] rather than the [[imperative mood]] of a code, and differs from an encyclopaedia in that it aims at economy of words. In the preface to the first instalment of the 1905 -17 edition, Jenks mentioned that the work had resulted from a suggestion of the President of the Berlin Society for Comparative Jurisprudence and Political Economy for a statement of English law, intended by the Society as the first of its projected series of handbooks on the legal systems of modern civilized communities, it being the Society's intention to produce a series of works to be modelled after the pattern of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] which came into force throughout the German Empire on 1 January 1900, but departing from the arrangement of the German Code as considered advisable.&lt;ref&gt;''A digest of English civil law, by Edward Jenks, (editor) W. M. Geldart, W. S. Holdsworth, R. W. Lee, J. C. Miles. London, Butterworth, 1905-1917.[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009527050]&lt;/ref&gt; Jenks's ''Digest'' was published by [[Butterworths]], who, from 1907, were also publishing ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'' as a "complete statement of the whole law of England".

Edward Jenks is most famous for his iconoclastic essay ''The Myth of Magna Carta'' published in the [[Independent Review]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Max Radin ''The Myth of Magna Carta'' Harvard Law Review, Vol. 60, No. 7 (Sep., 1947), pp. 1060-1091.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1335742]&lt;/ref&gt; Jenks argued against [[William Stubbs|Stubbs's]]  proposition that Magna Carta was the first corporate act of the nation roused to the sense of its unity, when the people of the towns and villages ranged themselves on the side of the barons against the king for the first time since the Norman Conquest.

'''Entention''' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]] in his 2011 book [[Incomplete Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;* ''Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter.''  New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-393-04991-6}} &lt;/ref&gt; The term is deliberately similar to the term [[intention]], which has a long history of use in [[philosophy of mind]], but was designed to have a broader scope. "Ententional" is an [[adjective]] that applies to the class of objects and phenomena that refer to or are in some other way "[[aboutness|about]]" something not present. This [[wikipedia]] page is ententional because it refers to and is explicitly about an abstract concept which is not physically present in the page itself. Other paradigm examples of ententional objects are [[books]], [[DNA]] strands, and [[tools]]. In contrast, [[rocks]], [[stars]], and [[electromagnetic radiation]] are not ententional.

[[Jeremy Sherman]] writes on ententionality, "Deacon coins the term "ententional," to encompass the entire range of phenomena that must be explained, everything from the first evolvable function, to human social processes, everything traditionally called intentional but also everything merely functional, fitting and therefore representing its environment with normative (good or bad fit) consequences."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ambigamy/201111/scientific-explanation-the-emergence-mattering-matter&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Intentionality]]

'''Fuat Sezgin''' (24 October 1924 – 30 June 2018) was a Turkish [[oriental studies|orientalist]] who specialized in the history of [[Islamic science|Arabic-Islamic science]]. He was ''professor emeritus'' of the History of Natural Science at [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] and the founder and honorary director of the Institute of the History of the Arab Islamic Sciences there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[New Straits Times]]|title=UKM to confer honorary doctorate on Prof Fuat Sezgin|date=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created museums in Frankfurt and Istanbul with replicas of historical Arabic-Islamic scientific instruments, tools and maps.&lt;ref name=tdn&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Turkish Daily News|date=27 December 2008|title=Islam History of Science and Technology Needs to Speak}} The utility of a museum of replicas in an antiquarian field contaminated by fakes is discussed by Prof. Nir Shafir at the Internet web site ''Aeon'' in 2018 at https://aeon.co/essays/why-fake-miniatures-depicting-islamic-science-are-everywhere?utm_source=Aeon+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=5d26c22c6e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_09_10_02_18&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_411a82e59d-5d26c22c6e-69662553 &lt;/ref&gt; His best known publication is the 17-volume ''Geschichte des Arabischen Schrifttums'', a standard reference in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Frankfurter Rundschau|url=http://de.qantara.de/wcsite.php?wc_c=3241|author=Gerhard Endreß|date=26 October 2004|language=German|title=Tradition und Aufbruch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Sezgin earned his PhD from [[Istanbul University]] under the German Orientalist [[Hellmut Ritter]] in 1950. His thesis titled "Buhari’nin Kaynakları"&lt;ref&gt;[http://kitaplar.ankara.edu.tr/detail.php?id=661 M.Fuad SEZGİN, Buhari'nin Kaynakları Hakkında Araştırmalar, Ankara Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi, ANKARA, 1956.]&lt;/ref&gt; (The Sources of Al-Bukhari) argued that, contrary to the common belief among European orientalists, [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Al-Bukhari]]'s edition of collected [[Hadith]]s was based on written sources dating back to the 7th century as well as oral history. He obtained a position at Istanbul University, but was dismissed in the wake of the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 coup]]. He moved to Germany in 1961 and started working as a visiting professor at the University of Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=kingFU/&gt; He was appointed professor at the university in 1965. His research in Frankfurt focused on [[Islamic Golden Age|Islam's Golden Age of Science]]. In 1982, Sezgin established the Institute of the History of the Arab Islamic Sciences. Today the Institute houses the most comprehensive collection of texts on the history of Arabic-Islamic science in the world. In 1983 Sezgin also founded a unique museum within the institute, bringing together more than 800 replicas of historical scientific instruments, tools and maps, mostly belonging to the Golden Age of Islamic science. A very similar museum was opened in 2008 in Istanbul.&lt;ref name=tdn/&gt;

In 1968, Sezgin found four previously unknown books of Diophantus' ''Arithmetica'' at the shrine of Imam Rezā in the holy Islamic city of Mashad in northeastern Iran.

==Publications==
Fuat Sezgin is the author and editor of numerous publications. His 17-volume work ''Geschichte des Arabischen Schrifttums'' (1967-2000) is the cornerstone reference on the [[Timeline of Muslim scientists and engineers|history of science and technology in the Islamic world]]. The 5-volume ''Natural Sciences of Islam'' documents the items in the Frankfurt museum. Since 1984 he has edited the ''Journal for the History of Arabic-Islamic Science''.

Sezgin has argued that Muslim seafarers had reached the Americas by 1420, citing as evidence the inscription on a map and the fact that the high longitudinal precision of early maps of the Americas would not have been attainable using Western navigational technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Fuat Sezgin|year=2006|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/8710396/The-PreColumbian-discovery-of-the-American-continent-by-muslim-seafarers|title=The Pre-Columbian Discovery of the American Continent by Muslim Seafarers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Sezgin received several awards, including the [[King Faisal International Prize]] of Islamic Studies in 1978&lt;ref name = "kingFU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.third.dimension.htm|title=The Third Dimension|author=Richard Covington|work=Saudi Aramco World|date=May–June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]. He is member of the [[Turkish Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref name="TUBA"&gt;[http://www.tuba.gov.tr/index_en.php?id=49 Turkish Academy of Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco and [[Arabic language academies|academies of Arabic Language]] in [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo|Cairo]], [[Arab Academy of Damascus|Damascus]] and [[Iraqi Academy of Sciences|Baghdad]].

==Recognition==
On 24 September 2012, [[Melih Gökçek]], Mayor of Municipality of Metropolitan Ankara, announced that a square in [[Ankara]] was named in honor of Fuat Sezgin. A relief of him created by artist Aslan Başpınar at the square was revealed the same day in the presence of Fuat Sezgin and his spouse Ursula by the mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sondakika.com/haber/haber-prof-dr-fuat-sezgin-adina-yapilan-aniti-kendisi-3963072/ |newspaper=Son Dakika |title=Prof. Dr. Fuat Sezgin Adına Yapılan Anıtı Kendisi Açtı |date=24 September 2012 |language=Turkish |accessdate=24 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fundación Yannick y Ben Jakober''' is located near [[Alcudia]], [[Mallorca]], [[Spain]]. Created in 1993, it is a private non-profit cultural institution, dedicated primarily to the preservation and restoration of Spanish Historical Heritage. Additionally it promotes the development of the fine arts in general and painting and sculpture in particular including the exhibition of artworks, the dissemination and knowledge of the matter, the artistic exchange and the implementation of activities aimed to facilitate the access to information of those who are interested. Its main territorial scope is the Balearic Islands.
The headquarters of the foundation is the Sa Bassa Blanca Museum, whose main building was designed by the famous Egyptian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] (1900-1989) in 1978. This building was declared a Listed Building (Landmark) by the Heritage Commission of the Government of Mallorca in 2011. The foundation is known for its collection of Old Master Portraits of Children from the 16th century to the 19th century, also listed as Historical Heritage, which is shown to the public in an old water reservoir conditioned for this purpose.

==History of the foundation==
The couple formed by Yannick Vu and Ben Jakober created the foundation in 1993, and counted from the beginning with the support of their friend, the banker and philanthropist Georges Coulon Karlweis(died 2012).
[[Yannick Vu]], president of the foundation, a painter and sculptor, born in [[France]] (1942) is now British. With a Vietnamese father and a French mother she grew up in [[Vence]] and [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]] in a family linked to the arts and music. Her father, [[Vu Cao Dam]] (1908-2000) was a renowned Vietnamese painter and sculptor. Yannick Vu met the painter [[Domenico Gnoli (painter)|Domenico Gnoli]] (1933-1970) in 1963 in [[Paris]] and that same year they traveled together to [[Mallorca]], they married in 1965 in [[New York City]]. Gnoli died at the age of 36, having achieved international success. In 1972, Yannick Vu remarried the sculptor Ben Jakober secretary of the Fundación. Beginning in 1979 Yannick Vu regularly exhibited her paintings in Europe and the U.S. and in the eighties she started making sculpture.
Ben Jakober is the secretary of the Fundación. Born in [[Vienna]] in 1930, he has had ties to Mallorca since 1968. Self-taught, he began his career as a sculptor at forty, encouraged by Yannick Vu. He uses different techniques and materials such as [[polyurethane]], [[metal]], [[stone]], [[marble]], [[Installation art|installation]], video and fiber optics and has had international exhibitions in Paris, New York, [[Budapest]], [[Madrid]] and Palma de Mallorca. He has participated in numerous biennials.
Since 1992, Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu sign their work together, as if they were a single artist. Their works form part of various public and private collections around the world. You can find works signed by them in different parts of Mallorca, such as Alcudia, Pollensa, the university campus, the airport or in front of Palma's Cathedral.
The foundation's board includes: Vice President Anthonie Stal (chairman of the board of the Kröller-Muller Museum in Otterlo, the Netherlands); Sofia Carmen Barroso Fernandez Araoz (expert in art and museum relations) and Cristina López Mancisidor de Macaya (former president of the Red Cross in Spain, Sebastian Escarrer Jaume (Counsellor of Melia Hotels International)  and Enrique Juncosa Cirer (Poet and curator).
Sa Bassa Blanca's main building, home to the foundation, has gone through different stages throughout its history. Originally, it was a typical Majorcan farm house, dedicated to agriculture and native livestock. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] and until the 70's, the edifice was a military base due to its strategic location on the Bay of Alcudia. In 1978 the property was acquired by a consortium of which Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu formed part. They commissioned the Egyptian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] (1900-1989) to draw up the plans, which made Sa Bassa Blanca the only building designed by him in Europe. The rooms of the new building, thought of as a "ribat", were organized around a central courtyard. The Hispano Moresque character of the building is well suited to the island of Mallorca, having seen many different civilizations over the years. In April 2011 the Hassan Fathy building was declared a Listed Building (Landmark) by the Heritage Commission of the Government of Mallorca.

==Contents of the foundation==

===The “Nins” Collection===
[[File:Retrato de una niña con cerezas.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Portrait of a girl with cherries by Joan Mestre i Bosch (1826-1893)]]
After the initial contribution by the founders and with the help of other benefactors, the foundation has assembled an important collection of works of art. The main collection is “Nins”, which began over 40 years ago with a painting by the Majorcan painter [[Joan Mestre i Bosch]] (1826-1893) "Portrait of a girl with cherries" and now consists of more than 150 Old Master portraits of children from the 16th to the 19th centuries from different European countries. Most of the works represent portraits of royalty or nobility in their childhood, although there are some bourgeois and provincial paintings. Part of this collection is on view in an old underground water reservoir that was transformed into an exhibition hall and equipped to house and preserve the paintings. The collection shows the evolution of costumes, jewelry, amulets, pets, and toys that were part of the everyday life of the young models. Some of the works were commissioned to be sent to European courts in view of a marriage, as part of a complex net of political alliances and families, designed to ensure the survival of the main royal and noble dynasties of Europe.

The foundation also has a program of travelling temporary international exhibitions. Selected works have been exhibited in prominent museums like the Museu d'Arte Brasileira, [[Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado]] in São Paulo in 2000; the [[Museu de Belles Arts de València]] in 2000; the [[Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland]] in Bonn in the winter of 2003/2004; the Museum of Fine Arts of Corunna in 2004; the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville in the winter of 2004/2005; the State Historical Museum in Moscow in the winter of 2005/2006; the [[Columbus Museum of Art]], the [[Huntsville Museum of Art]], The Society of the Four Arts,Palm Beach, Florida and the Nassau County Museum of Art, Roslyn Harbor, New York in 2008/2009 and the KunsthalleKrems, Austria in 2011. In October 2012 fifty six pictures are being shown in the [[Pera Museum]], Istanbul and in 2013 thirty five are going to the [[Casa del Cordón (Burgos)]] in Burgos, Spain.
Texts have been written by prominent Spanish, French, Italian and Dutch arthistorians, many of which are included in international publications.

===SoKraTESspace===

The main subject of the technical underground hall called SoKraTES revolves around the installation inspired by [[Einstein]]'s formula which defines the relationship between space and time. The spectacular curtain of Swarovski crystals made with 10.000 crystals acts as a dramatic backdrop toa complete fossilized skeleton of a Siberian woolly rhinoceros ([[Coelodonta antiquitatis]]), dated to the Riss-Wurm interglacial period of the [[Late Pleistocene]]. There are also works by Dolores Vita, [[José María Sicilia]], Jannis Kounellis, [[Gerhard Merz]] and [[Miquel Barceló]] (Felanitx, 1957), author of the new chapel in Palma cathedral; some works by Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu and tribal masks from [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Africa]] and the [[Himalayas]].

===Library===
The foundation's library houses more than 7,000 specialized books on art, photography and architecture, catalogued using the MilleniumInnopac program, supplied by the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] and shared by the Network of Libraries of the Balearic Islands, which allows students of the Universitat de les Illes Balears (UIB) to view the list of catalogued books via the Internet. Students or teachers can visit the library in person to consult the books by appointment. The library includes several works of contemporary art, such as the library wheel "Leer con Prisa” by Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu, six lithographs by Miquel Barceló and two portraits of the founders painted by their friend Mati Klarwein (1932-2002).

===Sculpture park===
The foundation has a park with "zoological" sculptures. Located in the gardens that surround the museum, the sculptures by Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu are animal forms inspired by archaeological works currently preserved in museums around the world. The monumental sculptures are executed in granite. The largest work is "Dog", based on a terracotta of the Japanese Haniwa culture (4th and 5th centuries AD), in the Tokyo National Museum.

===Rose garden===

Designed by Yannick Vu, the rose garden has over a hundred varieties of fragrant old English roses. It is designed as a walled "HortusConclusus" or medieval garden and is combined with an experimental organic kitchen garden.

===Educational activities===
The foundation receives visits from people of many nationalities, attracted by its strategic location and its important collections. At present, its most important activity is the development of the educational program, focused on schools on the island of Mallorca, university interns and families with children.
Students of all ages have the opportunity to come and commence their knowledge of art through specialized visits. During the school year 2013/14 there were 3549 school visitors, while this year 2014/2015 we received 4470 students. The challenge, from the beginning, has been to provide different views on how to foment a first contact with art and encourage the curiosity of the youngest, in a playful yet didactic way. Educational visits to the Sa Bassa Blanca Museum are developed under the title "Discovering the history of art and its hidden secrets." This activity takes place in the different exhibition halls and endeavors to open a window on art in the hope that this first experience becomes a positive drive for future interactions with art.
Based on the historical context and the importance of symbolism in the exhibitions, this visit aims to transmit values of respect and admiration for the artistic legacy. It is intended that students learn to enjoy art, its mechanisms (approaching artistic techniques) and their different languages, as well as understand the notion of timelessness in human expression through art and history.

:''For Earl Henry, father of two Scottish kings, see [[Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon]]''

'''Henry of Huntingdon''' ({{lang-la|Henricus Huntindoniensis}}; {{circa}} 1088 – {{circa|lk=no}} AD 1157), the son of a [[canon (priest)|canon]] in the [[diocese of Lincoln]], was a [[English historians in the Middle Ages|12th-century English historian]], the author of a history of England, the ''Historia Anglorum'', "the most important [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] historian to emerge from the [[secular clergy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. [https://books.google.be/books?id=TRMaCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9 9]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[archdeacon of Huntingdon]]. The few details of Henry's life that are known originated from his own works and from a number of official records. He was brought up in the wealthy court of [[Robert Bloet|Robert Bloet of Lincoln]], who became his patron.

At the request of Bloet's successor, [[Alexander of Lincoln]], Henry began to write his ''Historia Anglorum'', first published around 1129, an account of the history of England from its beginnings up to the year 1154.

==Life==
Henry was born in about 1088 and died about 1157. He succeeded his father Nicholas as archdeacon [[Diocese of Lincoln]] in 1110.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; No personal correspondence or anecdotes survived him and it seemed that no one considered him important enough to have written a memorial.  His biography depends upon a few notices scattered through his own work and in a few places where he left his name in the course of his official duties.   The identity of his mother is unknown. His father Nicholas, the first archdeacon of Huntingdon, was a clerk in holy orders, who had enough influence with the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] to secure the succession of his title for his son, a substantial inheritance for a man who had not yet reached thirty.&lt;ref&gt;Partner, pp.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas was canon of Lincoln for over thirty years until his death in 1110.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Henry was received as a little boy into the ''[[Medieval household|familia]]'' of [[Robert Bloet]] of [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] and grew up in luxury, living in the wealth and splendour of England's richest episcopal court. His upbringing gave him a positive outlook towards the world, but in later years he learned to feel a certain recoil distrust of ''[[contemptus mundi]]'', "contempt for the world", a feeling which encompasses much of his mature literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Partner, p.12-13&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Bloet's successor, [[Alexander of Lincoln]], became sensible of Henry's aptitude for business and employed him frequently for important affairs, though it remains clear that Henry owed his promotion to the [[patronage]] of Bishop Bloet.  It was at Bishop Alexander's request that Henry began to write his ''Historia Anglorum''  ('The History of The English').&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=O6U5BTD0-rYC&amp;pg=PA239 Historia Anglorum]'', Forester, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; The formal Prologue of his History, which was addressed to Bishop Alexander, was written in a floridly dense high style that allowed him to parade himself, before retreating into dutiful obscurity behind the chroniclers he had used. It was written as an elaborate defence of the writing of history and to show off his degree of education.&lt;ref&gt;Partner, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Henry's contempt for the world grew and became the informing spirit of his literary work and spiritual life.  During his travels, he began to notice that people were more worried about taking care of their belongings rather than themselves. This led him to write a long poem on ''De contemptu visibilum''.&lt;ref&gt;Partner, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the little-known information about Henry is concrete and suggestive, hinting at a life lived just below the first ranks of property and talent in an age of personal reticence.  He mentions [[Lanfranc]] as having been "famous in our own time", which places Henry's birthdate a few years before 1089, the year Lanfranc died. His ''Historia Anglorum'' leaves off in 1154, with the promise of another book for the new reign; however, since that book was never written it may be assumed that Henry died shortly afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Partner, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==

===''Historia''===
Henry's most notable work is the ''Historia Anglorum''.   He was bidden by Bishop Alexander of Lincoln to write a history of England from the earliest period and bringing it to modern times, ending it upon the accession of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1154.  It was assumed that the first edition was published at the end of 1129 and the second in 1135, at the end of the reign of [[Henry I of England]]. He published new editions as the years went on, the final fifth copy coming down in 1154, supposedly to terminate the History with the death of [[Stephen of England|Stephen]], leaving his history organised into eight books.  There is some evidence that Henry did not intend to stop there, intending to add another book to his series that would cover the events of the first five years of the reign of Henry II. It was never carried out, as Henry of Huntingdon must have been at least seventy years old by the time of the king's accession and died shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Huntingdon, pp. ix-xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's ear for telling detail is responsible for entertaining touches drawn from current legend and his own fertile imagination. [[C. Warren Hollister]] notes the anecdote of [[Cnut the Great|King Canute]]'s failure to stem the tide by command and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]'s ignoring his physician's orders to dine on [[lampreys]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Such touches rendered his history popular – there are twenty-five surviving manuscripts – and they embedded his anecdotes firmly into popular history.

''Historia Anglorum'' was first printed by [[Sir Henry Savile]] in 1596 in the historical miscellany ''Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores post Bedam praecipui''.

Henry's sources included:

*[[Bede]], ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', for the years up to 731.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'': Henry&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' (Vatican recension).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
*[[Paul the Deacon]]'s ''Historia Romana'', for Roman emperors, as well as [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] and [[Aurelius Victor]]&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
*The works of [[Saint Jerome]] and [[Gregory the Great]], with which Henry had a passing familiarity.
*Saints' Lives (especially Book 9).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
*Versions of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' similar to C and E. This included the poem on [[Brunanburh]], which he translated into [[Latin]].
*A lost version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which he shared with [[John of Worcester]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; This version contained quite a number of detailed and valuable accounts of battles of the Saxon invasions of Britain which are only preserved in Henry's ''Historia''.
*[[Old English]] poems, which he translated into Latin. This may include the legend of King Canute and the waves, as well as material on [[Siward, Earl of Northumbria]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
*[[Old French]] songs, for Norman history.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Other works===
As an author, Henry distinguished himself in his youth by writing poetry, comprising eight books of epigrams, eight books on love, and the so-called ''Anglicanus ortus'', eight books on herbs, spices and gems united by a medical theme.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Henry of Huntingdon. ''Anglicanus ortus: a Verse Herbal of the Twelfth Century'', edited and translated by Winston Black. Toronto, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, c2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, two books of epigrams and the eight medical books survive, the latter identified only in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anglicanus ortus'' has since been published, books 1–6 (on herbs and spices) as ''Anglicanus ortus: a Verse Herbal of the Twelfth Century'' (Toronto, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, c2012), and books 7–8 (on gems) as "Henry of Huntingdon's lapidary rediscovered and his ''Anglicanus ortus'' reassembled" (''Mediaeval Studies'', v. 68, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–87), both edited by Winston Black.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', pp. 8–13, 496.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry wrote an [[Epistle]] to [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] on the Succession of foreign kings and emperors up to their own time, and another to a man named Warin that contained an account of the ancient British kings from [[Brutus of Troy|Brute]] to [[Cadwaladr|Cadwaller]]. The information for this account was obtained from a monk while Henry was at the [[Abbey of Bec]], which held the writings of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Henry's most notable epistle was a funereal exercise addressed to his recently deceased friend and fellow archdeacon of Lincoln diocese, Walter of Leicester, titled ''De contemptu mundi'' ("On Contempt for the world"), which from internal evidence dates to 1135.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forester, pp.xi-xii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to history==

The contribution that Henry of Huntingdon brought to history cannot solely rest with his ''Historia Anglorum'' but must also include his Epistles.  All of these writings offer an insight into the minds of those who lived in the twelfth century and illuminate how historians of the time recorded history and corresponded with their peers.  Henry's legacy consisted of his own contribution to the history of England and his recorded thoughts and ideas, thereby opening a valuable perspective on his era's mindset.

{{Feminism sidebar}}
'''Herstory''' is history written from a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective, emphasizing the role of women, or told from a woman's [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]].  The principal aim of herstory is to bring women out of alleged obscurity from the historical record{{fact|date=December 2018}}. It is a [[neologism]] coined as a pun with the word "history", as part of a feminist critique of conventional [[historiography]], which in their opinion is traditionally written as "his story", i.e., from the masculine point of view.&lt;ref name=mills/&gt; (The word "history"&amp;mdash;from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἱστορία, or ''historia'', meaning "knowledge obtained by inquiry"&amp;mdash;is etymologically unrelated to the [[possessive]] [[personal pronoun|pronoun]] ''[[he|his]]''.&lt;ref name=mills&gt;Jane Mills, "Womanwords: a dictionary of words about women", 1992, {{ISBN|0-02-921495-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=TiGET5_hB8e5hAeq3-m-CA&amp;id=A74UAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=womanwords&amp;q=%22early+1970s%22 p. 118.]&lt;/ref&gt;) This movement has led to an increase in activity in other female-centric disciplines such as [[femistry]] and [[galgebra]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Words and Women|first1=Casey|last1=Miller|first2=Kate|last2=Swift|year=1976|publisher=Bantam Doubleday Dell|isbn=9780385048583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The herstory movement has spawned women-centered presses, such as [[Virago Press]] in 1973, which publishes fiction and non-fiction by noted women authors like [[Janet Frame]] and [[Sarah Dunant]].

==Usage==
[[Robin Morgan]], in a book of her selected writings states that the debut of the word "herstory" was in the byline of her article ''Goodbye to All That'', in early 1970, in the first issue of the "underground" [[New Left]] newspaper ''Rat'' after it was overtaken by women to clean it of sexism. She writes that she identified herself as a member of W.I.T.C.H., decoding the acronym as "Women Inspired to Commit Herstory".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Morgan, ''The Word of a Woman: Feminist Dispatches'', a 2014 edition, {{ISBN|1497678072}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sZiWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33 p. 33.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[Casey Miller]] and [[Kate Swift]] wrote in ''Words &amp; Women,''
:When women in the movement use herstory, their purpose is to emphasize that women's lives, deeds, and participation in human affairs have been neglected or undervalued in standard histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Words and Women|first1=Casey|last1=Miller|first2=Kate|last2=Swift|year=1976|publisher=Bantam Doubleday Dell|isbn=9780385048583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s, [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]] saw the study of history as a male-dominated intellectual enterprise and presented "herstory" as a means of compensation.&lt;ref name="looser"&gt;Devoney Looser, ''British Women Writers and the Writing of History'' ([[Johns Hopkins University Press]]: 2000).  {{ISBN|0-8018-6448-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term, intended to be both serious and comic,&lt;ref&gt;Angus Calder and [[Lizbeth Goodman]], "Gender and Poetry", in ''Literature and Gender,'' ed. by Lizbeth Goodman (Routledge: 1996).  {{ISBN|0-415-13573-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; became a rallying cry used on T-shirts and buttons as well as in [[academia]].&lt;ref name=Sommers&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed Women |last=Hoff Sommers |first=Christina |year=1995|publisher=[[Touchstone Books]] |location=[[United Kingdom]] |isbn=0-684-80156-6 |chapter=3 (Transforming the Academy) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Hridith Sudev]], an inventor, environmentalist and social activist associated with various youth movements, launched 'The Herstory Movement'; an online platform to "celebrate lesser known great persons; female, queer or otherwise marginalized, who helped shape the modern World History".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sudev|first1=Hridith|title=The Herstory Movement|url=https://herstorymovt.wordpress.com/|website=The Herstory Movement|publisher=Hridith Sudev|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended as an academic platform to feature stories of female historic persons and thus help facilitate more widespread knowledge about 'Great Women' History.

==Criticism==
[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has been a vocal critic of the concept of herstory, and presented her argument against the movement in her 1994 book, ''[[Who Stole Feminism?]]''. Sommers defined herstory as an attempt to infuse education with ideology, at the expense of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed Women |last=Hoff Sommers |first=Christina |year=1995|publisher=[[Touchstone Books]] |location=[[United Kingdom]] |isbn=0-684-80156-6 |page=97 |chapter=5 (The Feminist Classroom) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[gender feminism|gender feminists]]", as she termed them, were the band of feminists responsible for the movement, which she felt amounted to [[negationism]]. She regarded most attempts to make historical studies more female-inclusive as being artificial in nature, and an impediment to progress.&lt;ref name="Sommers"/&gt;

Professor and author Devoney Looser has criticized the concept of herstory for overlooking the contributions that some women made as historians before the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="looser" /&gt;

[[Global Language Monitor|The Global Language Monitor]], a nonprofit group that analyzes and tracks trends in language, named ''herstory'' the third most "politically incorrect" word of 2006—rivaled only by ''"[[Macaca (term)|macaca]]"'' and ''"[[Climate change denial|Global Warming Denier]]".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languagemonitor.com/politically_correct Global Language Monitor web page] (2006). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826013737/http://www.languagemonitor.com/politically_correct |date=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macaca Reuters"&gt;{{cite web|title="Macaca" named most politically incorrect word|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=December 16, 2006|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUKN1516924620061219|accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Holy Terror''''' is 2011 a graphic novel by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] which follows a superhero named The Fixer as he battles [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorists]] after an attack on Empire City.

The novel was originally proposed as '''''Holy Terror, Batman!''''' in 2006 but is no longer a project associated with the [[Batman]] character or [[DC Comics]]. Miller explained in 2010 "It's no longer a DC book. I decided partway through it that it was not a Batman story."&lt;ref name="boucher1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Geoff |last=Boucher |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/frank-miller-takes-holy-terror-out-of-gotham-ive-taken-batman-as-far-as-he-can-go-.html |title=Frank Miller's 'Holy Terror' leaves Gotham: 'I've taken Batman as far as he can go' |work=Hero Complex |publisher=[[LA Times]] |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
As originally announced the plot revolved around Batman defending [[Gotham City]] from an attack by the [[Islamist]] terrorist group [[Al-Qaeda]]. According to Miller, the comic would have been a "piece of [[propaganda]]" in which Batman "kicks [[Al-Qaeda]]'s ass."&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;On Holy Terror, as quoted in [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4717696.stm "Comic book hero takes on al-Qaeda" [[BBC News]]. (February 15, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mount |first=Harry |title= Holy propaganda! Batman is tackling Osama bin Laden |date=February 15, 2006 |work=Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/15/wbats15.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/02/15/ixworld.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller announced the graphic novel during a panel at the [[WonderCon]] [[comic book convention]] held in San Francisco in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Hilary |title=WonderCon '06: Holy Terror, Batman! |date=February 12, 2006 |publisher=ign.com |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/688/688140p1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He summarized the work as "not to put too fine a point on it, a piece of propaganda... [[Superman]] punched out [[Hitler]]. So did [[Captain America]]. That's one of the things they're there for."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The title of the graphic novel is a reference to the [[War on Terror]] as well as the [[Snowclone|catchphrase]] ("Holy [something], Batman!") used by [[Burt Ward]] ([[Robin (comics)|Robin]]) in the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' television series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Frank Miller (Interviewee) |date=2006 |url=http://www.spacecast.com/videoplayer_1696.aspx |title=Frank Miller's 'Holy Terror Batman' |medium=TV clip |location=Canada |publisher=[[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506011930/http://www.spacecast.com/videoplayer_1696.aspx |archivedate=May 6, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, on the anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]], [[NPR]] aired a brief memorial commentary by Miller, which provided insight into his inspiration for this project:

{{quote|For the first time in my life I know how it feels to face an existential menace. They want us to die. All of a sudden I realize what my parents were talking about all those years. Patriotism, I now believe, isn't some sentimental, old conceit. It's self-preservation. I believe patriotism is central to a nation's survival. Ben Franklin said it: If we don't all hang together, we all hang separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Frank |title=That Old Piece of Cloth |date=September 11, 2006 |publisher=NPR Morning Edition |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5784518}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a May 2007 interview, Miller relayed that he was still at work on the graphic novel, which he said was "bound to offend just about everybody".&lt;ref name=RottenTomatoes&gt;{{cite news |last=Utichi |first=Joe|title=RT-UK Exclusive: Frank Miller On "The Spirit"...In 3D? |date=May 30, 2007 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=424110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also said he was about 100 pages into it with 50 remaining.&lt;ref name=RottenTomatoes /&gt; The following year Miller said the series, until then being billed as ''Holy War, Batman'', would no longer feature Batman. "As I worked on it, it became something that was no longer Batman," he clarified. "It's somewhere past that and I decided it's going to be part of a new series that I'm starting."&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Andy.

Page 2 of 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Miller said he was no longer working on that project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/04/13/frank-miller-holy-terror-batman/ |title=Frank Miller Confirms He's No Longer Doing 'Holy Terror, Batman!' |publisher=ComicsAlliance.com |date= |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924234829/http://comicsalliance.com/frank-miller-holy-terror-batman/ |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifying that ''Holy Terror'' was in progress but without Batman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/FrankMillerInk/status/15220154410 |title=Twitter / Frank Miller: RT @aldorantes batman vs |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said it would feature a new character called The Fixer and not be published by DC. "It's no longer a DC book," he explained. "I decided partway through it that it was not a Batman story. The hero is much closer to [[Dirty Harry]] than Batman. It's a new hero that I've made up that fights Al Qaeda."&lt;ref name="boucher1"/&gt;

At [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2011, Miller further explained the reason to drop Batman and use The Fixer as the protagonist, saying "This character is much more well adjusted in committing terrible acts of violence on very evil people." Talking about the controversy the graphic novel might generate, he said he hoped the book accomplished its purpose in angering people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://collider.com/frank-miller-comic-con-holy-terror/|title= Comic-Con 2011: Frank Miller on HOLY TERROR: “I Hope This Book Really Pisses People Off”|author= Hunter Daniels|work= [[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher= [[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]|date= July 23, 2011|accessdate= April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
''Holy Terror'' was controversial upon release; many comic book writers and reviewers argued that the novel's depiction of Muslims was [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/americas/holy-terror-comic-is-islamophobic-say-critics|title=Holy Terror comic is 'Islamophobic', say critics {{!}} The National|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Brothers of [[ComicsAlliance]], in a review of the book, felt that Miller's writing "[simplifies] matters to an almost absurd level... the enemy in ''Holy Terror'' is not so much the terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, but the religion of [[Islam]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/frank-millers-holy-terror-review/|title=Frank Miller's 'Holy Terror': A Propaganda Comic That Fights Faith Instead of Evil [Review]|website=ComicsAlliance|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Cyriaque Lamar of [[Io9]] called the portrayal of terrorists "cartoonish... [gutting] ''Holy Terror'' of any emotional resonance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5845828/frank-millers-holy-terror-isnt-just-a-bad-comic--its-a-bad-propaganda-comic|title=Frank Miller's Holy Terror isn't just a bad comic — it's a bad propaganda comic|last=Lamar|first=Cyriaque|work=io9|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer Ackerman of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' wrote that the book was "one of the most appalling, offensive and vindictive comics of all time... Miller's ''Holy Terror'' is a screed against Islam, completely uninterested in any nuance or empathy toward 1.2 billion people he conflates with a few murderous conspiracy theorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/09/holy-terror-frank-miller/|title=Frank Miller's Holy Terror Is Fodder for Anti-Islam Set|last=Ackerman|first=Spencer|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, fellow Batman writer [[Grant Morrison]] criticized the novel's concept, saying:

{{quote|text=Batman vs. Al Qaeda! It might as well be [[Bin Laden]] vs. [[King Kong]]! Or how about the sinister Al Qaeda mastermind up against a hungry [[Hannibal Lecter]]! For all the good it's likely to do. Cheering on a fictional character as he beats up fictionalized terrorists seems like a decadent indulgence when real terrorists are killing real people in the real world. I'd be so much more impressed if Frank Miller gave up all this graphic novel nonsense, joined the Army and, with a howl of undying hate, rushed headlong onto the front lines with the young soldiers who are actually risking life and limb 'vs.' Al Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.newsarama.com/dcnew/Batman/Morrison/Morrison_Batman.html |title=Morrison in the Cave: Grant Morrison Talks Batman |work=Newsarama |date=August 23, 2006 |accessdate=December 27, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705190553/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Batman/Morrison/Morrison_Batman.html |archivedate=July 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Miller responded generally to these criticisms on his blog, again referring to the book as intentional propaganda "without apology" and saying, "I'm too old to serve my country in any other way. Otherwise, I'd gladly be pulling the trigger myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://frankmillerink.com/2011/9/propaganda|title=Propaganda {{!}} Frank Miller Ink|date=2014-10-16|access-date=2017-05-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016134216/http://frankmillerink.com/2011/9/propaganda|archivedate=October 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2018 Miller expressed regret for writing ''Holy Terror'': "When I look at ''Holy Terror'', which I really don’t do all that often, I can really feel the anger ripple out of the pages... I don’t want to wipe out chapters of my own biography. But I’m not capable of that book again."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/frank-miller-xerxes-cursed-sin-city-the-dark-knight-returns&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning the Catholicosate to [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] since it had been reclaimed from the Arabs, he moved it again to [[Vaspurakan]] around 924. According to local traditions, Hovhannes was buried in Vaspurakan at either Joroy Vank or in the monastery of [[Akhtamar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11891">'''Abu Amir Ahmad Ibn Gharsiya al-Bashkunsi''' ({{lang-ar|أبو عامر أحمد بن غرسية 
البشكنسي }}) (died 1084), popularly known as '''Ibn Gharsiya'''  was a [[Muladi|Muwallad]] poet and ''katib'' (writer) in the ''[[taifa]]'' court of [[Denia]]. 
Ibn Gharsiya was a leading figure in the ''[[Shu'ubiyya]]'' movement of Al-Andalus. He should not be confused with a Cordoban ''[[faqih]]'' of the same name.

==Personal background==
Ibn Gharsiya was born into a Christian [[Basque people|Basque]] family, but was taken prisoner in his childhood and raised in the Islamic faith. He grew up proficient and eloquent in both [[Classical Arabic]] and the colloquial [[Andalusian Arabic|Andalusi Arabic]] dialect. Ibn Gharsiya was proud of his Basque origin and remained a lifelong fervent Muslim throughout his lifetime. His surname ''al-Bashkunsi'' is the Arabic word for Basque, and therefore, signified his Basque heritage. He served under the [[Slavs|Slavic]] ''[[Emir]]'' of [[Denia]], [[Mujāhid al-‘Āmirī]], and his son, Ali ibn Mujahid.&lt;ref name="Alfonso"&gt;{{harvnb|Alfonso|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yjgCFjJ02uEC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true 37]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Ibn Gharsiya, the ruling family of Denia were also Muladi and had broken free from the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]] after the turbulent year of 1009. Like other ''taifas'', his kingdom had sought to distance itself from the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]]. Ibn Gharsiya subsequently spent most of his life as a ''katib'' at the court of Denia.

==Ideology==
Ibn Gharsiya was a leading proponent and advocate of the ''[[Shu'ubiyya]]'' thought in Al-Andalus.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; The ''Shu'ubiyya'' movement demanded equality of power, wealth and status of the Non-Arab Berbers and Muwalladun by Arabs.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; In common with the Arabs, they were very active in promoting the Arab-Islamic culture and language and claimed cultural integration with the Arab ethnic groups—as had been achieved by the non-Arab [[Semitic people]]s of the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1977|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UfQWT_esc5cC&amp;pg=PA585#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 585]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''risala'' of Ibn Gharsiya==
Between 1051 and 1056, Ibn Gharsiya wrote a ''[[risalah (fiqh)|risala]]'' against the [[Arab]] ascendancy in al-Andalus, which concurrently praises non-Arab Islam. Opponents of this work have called it violent, insulting, and bitter in its attack on the Arabs and, contrary to prevailing tradition, it criticises Arab Muslims as inferior in rank and lineage. Simultaneously, it glorifies non-Arab Muslims, such as the [[Berber people|Berbers]], and also those converts from the [[Visigoths]], [[Slavs]], and [[Roman Empire|Romans]].&lt;ref name="Donzel"&gt;{{harvnb|van Donzel|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 129]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''risala'', Ibn Gharsiya asserts cultural superiority of the Muwalladun over the Arabs by diminishing and belittling Arab culture.&lt;ref name="Alfonso"/&gt; While he boasts about the Muladi mastery of natural philosophy, exact logic, astronomy, music, arithmetic, and geometry, he ridicules Arabs as "experts in the description of towering camels."&lt;ref name="Alfonso"/&gt; He also tries to show that non-Arab rule in Denia was much better than those of the other ''taifas''. By doing so, he attempted to formulate and legitimise a non-Arab alternative to Arab rule which involved combining Arab and non-Arab traditions, which were mainly [[Culture of Iran|Persian]] and [[Byzantine]]. This gave him an opportunity to debate with the Arab Islamic scholar Abu Jaʻfar Ahmad ibn al-Jazzar, who had been present at the court of Ibn Sumadih, ''Emir'' of [[Almeria]]. However, according to the Escorial manuscript, the letter was addressed to a certain Abu ʻAbd Allah Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn al-Haddad al-Qaisi. However, despite this difference, it is clear that the addressee was linked to the court of Ibn Sumadih and to the ''taifa'' state of Almeria.

Ibn Gharsiya's epistle addresses some of the most fundamental and important questions in the Muslim community of al-Andalus at the time, such as the relationship between the Arabs and Berbers of the Islamic faith with the Muwalladun, who were the descendants of the indigenous [[Iberians|Iberian]] converts to [[Islam]]. Ibn Gharsiya stressed that a sound interpretation of Islam should also be of value to the non-Arab Muslims. This epistle represents the adoption of the Eastern ''Shuʻubi'' ideology by many indigenous Andalusian Muslims, which argued against Arab exclusivity, as expressed in their treatises comparing the Arabs unfavourably with the Persians and the Byzantines.

Ibn Gharsiya's ''risala'' was written in Arabic courtly prose; thus it did not represent a rejection of Arabic literary culture, but only of Arab lineage. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'', this ''risala'' was of minor importance, and its few exponents tended to repeat clichés adopted from the earlier Islamic East. The ''risala'' elicited at least seven refutations, only five of which actually survive.&lt;ref name="Diesenberger"/&gt; Like the original, the refutations seem to have been written in imitation of eastern models.&lt;ref name="Diesenberger"/&gt; Only one of the refutations was specifically directed against Ibn Gharsiya.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}&lt;ref name="Diesenberger"&gt;{{harvnb|Corradini|Diesenberger|Reimitz|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=e6sfGt10UzcC&amp;pg=PA347#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 347]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American scholar [[James T. Monroe]] states that the fact of Ibn Gharsiya's ''risala'' against the Arabs going unpunished, indicates that the cause of [[Arabism]] as a meaningful social force had ceased to have any political significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monroe|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZzXksIVQuYC&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 13]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Göran Larsson, an associate professor of religious studies at the [[University of Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]], points out that in spite of his extensive use of Persian traditions in his ''risala'', Ibn Gharsiya was not promoting a specifically Persian sovereign, merely a non-Arab model of rule.&lt;ref name="Larsson"&gt;{{harvnb|Larsson|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QJ8EpN0232IC&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true 156]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this, Monroe adds:&lt;ref name="Larsson"/&gt;
{{quote|text="Had Ibn Garciá wished to reject Arabic culture in its entirety he would probably have written his ''risāla'' in a style different from the one that was judged at the time to be of good literary taste, and unlike the practice of Ibn Bassām, he might possibly have inserted postclassical literary forms into his composition. But the fact remains that the ''risāla'' is written in pure classical Arabic. It is a veritable mosaic of allusions to Arabic literature and history, containing quotations from the ''[[Koran]]'', from poetry and proverbial wisdom. All of this is expressed by means of a highly elaborated rhymed prose of the kind that was so much in vogue among the prose writers of the fifth century of Islam, and it is decorated with all the ornaments of Arabic rhetoric. The choice of this stylistic medium of expression which had become the standard of secretarial literature throughout the Islamic world indicates that the author attempts to claim for the non-Arab secretarial class its rightful share in Arabic culture."}}

==Legacy==
Besides the epistle, the only words from Ibn Gharsiya that has been preserved are some lines by the 12th century Andalusian geographer, historian and writer, [[Ibn Said al-Maghribi]]. These lines are believed to have been composed in praise of Ibn Gharsiya's lord, Ali ibn Mujahid.&lt;ref name="Corradini"/&gt; In praise of Ibn Gharsiya, Ibn Said states:&lt;ref name="Corradini"&gt;{{harvnb|Corradini|Diesenberger|Reimitz|2003|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text="He (Ibn Gharsiya) was one of the wonders of his age and the marvels of his time. Although his origin was of the non-Arabs, his famous ''risala'' bore witness to his firm command of the reins of the Arabic language. He was one of the children of the Christian Basques who was captured while still a child. His lord, Mujahid, the king of the [[Balearic islands]] and of Denia educated him. There was between Ibn Gharsiya and Abu Ja'far ibn al-Jazar, the poet, such a friendship that it caused the former to call the latter to join him and stop serving al-Mu'staim ibn Sumadih, lord of Almeria. Ibn Gharsiya found fault with him for adhering exclusively to the praise of Ibn Sumadih while neglecting the lord of his own country."}}

'''Janamejaya''' ({{lang-sa|जनमेजय}}) was a [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] king who reigned during the Middle [[Vedic period]] (12th-9th centuries BCE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Witzel]] (1989), ''Tracing the Vedic dialects'' in ''Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes'' ed. [[Colette Caillat|Caillat]], Paris, 97–265.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his father and predecessor [[Parikshit]], he played a decisive role in the consolidation of the Kuru state, the arrangement of [[Vedas|Vedic hymns]] into collections, and the development of the orthodox [[srauta]] ritual, transforming the Kuru realm into the dominant political and cultural center of northern [[India]]. He also appears as a figure in later legends and traditions, the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Puranas]].

== In Vedic Literature==
Janamejaya is mentioned as a great king and conqueror in a number of late [[Vedas|Vedic texts]]. The ''[[Aitareya Brahmana]]'' (VIII.21) states that his priest Tura Kāvasheya anointed him with the Aindra Mahabhisheka (great anointing of [[Indra]]). The ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' mentions that he performed an ''[[ashvamedha]]'' (horse sacrifice), for getting himself rid of the ''Brahmahatya'' (sin associated with killing of a [[Brahmin]]), and the priest who performed it for him was Indrota Daivapa [[Shaunaka]] at a place named Āsandīvat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Historicity ==

[[Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri|H.C. Raychaudhuri]] dates [[Parikshit]], his father, in ninth century BC.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|2006|pp=29-30}} [[Michael Witzel]] dates the Pārikṣita Dynasty of the Kuru Kingdom to the 12th-11th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Witzel (1989), [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/dialects.pdf ''Tracing the Vedic dialects''], p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one Janamejaya is mentioned in Vedic literature; however, post-Vedic literature (Mahabharata and Puranas) seems to indicate the existence of two kings by this name, one who lived before the [[Kurukshetra War]] was an ancestor to the [[Pandavas]], and one who lived later and was a descendant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=z3ksBrWoZm0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=Janamejaya+in+vedas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uxlT3X0OQt&amp;sig=nolhfblCyVqKdB1ObUXLIj0_vXY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGzLGrnv_YAhXLpZQKHSdiDkcQ6AEIeDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Janamejaya%20in%20vedas&amp;f=false|title=Vedic Civilization|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|date=2004|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=9788171418756|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[H. C. Raychaudhuri]] believes that the second Janamejaya's description better corresponds to the Vedic king, whereas the information available about first is scanty and inconsistent, but Raychaudhuri questions whether there were actually two distinct kings. He suggests that there "is an intrusion into the genealogical texts" of the late, post-Vedic tradition, which also has two of Janamejaya's father Parikshit, possibly "invented by genealogists to account for anachronisms" in the later parts of the Mahabharata, as "a bardic duplication of the same original individual regarding whose exact place in the Kuru genealogy no unanimous tradition had survived."&lt;ref&gt;Raychaudhuri (1996), pp.13-19&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Also, Witzel (1995) only refers to one Parikshit and one Janamejaya.}}

Four copper-plate grant inscriptions purportedly issued during Janamejaya's reign were discovered in the 20th century, but were proved to be fake by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Salomon |title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-4RDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167 |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-509984-3 |page=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shankar Goyal |title=History writing of early India: new discoveries and approaches |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pS9uAAAAMAAJ |year=1996 |publisher=Kusumanjali |oclc=34752382 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Puranic Literature ==
He was the son of King [[Parikshit]] and Queen Madravati according to the [[Mahabharata]] (I.95.85), but according to the [[Bhagavata Purana]] (I.xvi.2), his mother was Iravati, daughter of [[Uttara (Mahābhārata)|Uttara]].{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|2006|p=15, 35n}} He was the grandson of [[Abhimanyu]] and the great-grandson of [[Arjuna]], the valiant warrior hero of the [[Mahābhārata]]. He ascended to the Kuru throne following the death of his father. His significance comes as the listener of the first narration of the Mahābhārata, narrated by [[Vaishampayana]], pupil of [[Vyasa]]. According to the [[Vayu Purana]] and the [[Matsya Purana]], there was a dispute between him and Vaishampayana. Possibly, as its aftermath, he abdicated and his son Shatanika succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Misra, V.S. (2007). Ancient Indian Dynasties, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, {{ISBN|81-7276-413-8}}, p.278&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Purana]]s,

=== In Mahabharata ===
In [[Mahabharata]], Janmejaya was mentioned as having six able brothers viz, Kakshasena, Ugrasena, Chitrasena, Indrasena, Sushena and Nakhaysena.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Department of Letters'' by University of Calcutta (Dept. of Letters),Publ.Calcutta University Press, 1923, p2&lt;/ref&gt; The initial chapters of the epic narrates various aspects of his life including his conquest of [[Taxila|Takshasila]] and about his encounter with Naga Takshaka. He wanted to exterminate the race of Nagas, since Takshaka was responsible for the death of his father Parikshit.
[[File:Kashyapa_alive_tree_what_is_burnt_by_Takshak_(_near_Pond_)_and_parikshit_bitten_by_Takshak.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kashyapa_alive_tree_what_is_burnt_by_Takshak_(_near_Pond_)_and_parikshit_bitten_by_Takshak.jpg|thumb|parikshit bitten by Takshak from Birla razmnama.]]
Emperor Janmejay was responsible for the retelling of the famous epic ''[[Mahābhārata]]'', a story of Janmejay's ancestors from the time of [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]] up to the great [[Kurukshetra]] war between his great-grandfathers the [[Pandavas]] and their paternal cousins the [[Kauravas]]. The Mahabharata states that it was recited to Janmejay at the ''sarpa satra'' (snake sacrifice) by the sage [[Vaishampayana]] to whom it had been imparted by his perceptor [[Vedavyasa]],&lt;ref&gt;Vaidya P.L. and A.D. Pusalkar (1962, reprint 2003). ''The Mahabharata: Its History and Character'' in S. Radhakrishnan (ed.) ''The Cultural Heritage of India'', Vol.II, Kolkata:The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, {{ISBN|81-85843-03-1}}, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; after he asked [[Vaishampayana]] about his ancestors.

=== Sarpa satra (snake sacrifice) ===
[[File:Snakesacrifice.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Snakesacrifice.jpg|thumb|The snake sacrifice of Janmejay, as [[Astika (mythology)|Astika]] tries to stop it.]]
{{main|Sarpa Satra}}Emperor Janmejay ascended to the throne of [[Hastinapura]] upon the death of his father [[Parikshit]]. According to legend, Parikshit, the lone descendant of the House of [[Pandu]], had died of snakebite. He had been cursed by a sage to die so, the curse having been consummated by the serpent-chieftain [[Takshak]].
Janmejay bore a deep grudge against the serpents for this act, and thus decided to wipe them out altogether. He attempted this by performing a great ''Sarpa satra'' – a sacrifice that would destroy all living serpents.
At that time, a learned sage named [[Astika (mythology)|Astika]], a boy in age, came and interfered. His mother [[Manasa]] was a Naga and his father a [[Brahmin]]. Janmejay had to listen to the words of the learned Astika and set the then-imprisoned Takshaka free. He also stopped the massacre of the Nagas and ended all enmity with them (1,56). From that time onward, the Nagas and Kurus lived in peace.
The mass sacrifice was started on the banks of the river Arind at Bardan, now Known as Parham, a corrupt form of [[Parikshitgarh]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} A masonry tank (reservoir) said to have been built by Emperor Janmejay to mark the site of the sacrificial pit, known as ''Parikshit kund'', still exists in [[Mainpuri]] district. This is known as Gowdvana. Close to this village a very large and high khera {{further explanation needed|date=May 2017}} containing the ruins of a fort and some stone  sculptures has been found. It is said to date back to the time of Emperor Parikshit. A popular local legend is that as a consequence of the virtues of that sacrifice snakes are still harmless in this place and its neighborhood.

== Succession ==
According to ''Puranas'', Janamejaya was succeeded by his grandson Ashwamedatta Further in the lineage, are mentioned, Adhisima-krishna and Nichakshu. After the time of his successors, the dynasty came to an end.

[[File:France Americas relations.jpg|thumb|300px|Jean Cousin has a claim to the discovery of the [[New World]] in 1488.]]
'''Jean Cousin''', also '''Jehan Cousin''', was a 15th-century French [[Normandy|Normand]] navigator who was said to have discovered the [[New World]] in 1488, four years before [[Christopher Columbus]], when he landed in [[Brazil]] around the mouth of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]].&lt;ref name="Wintroub"&gt;''A savage mirror: power, identity, and knowledge in early modern France'' Michael Wintroub p.21 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MBEjEjq7pmoC&amp;pg=PA21]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McAbe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JsJ1MRuo1WQC&amp;pg=PA22 ''Nooks and corners of the New England coast'' Samuel Adams Drake p.22]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his captains was named [[Martín Alonso Pinzón|Alonzo Pinzón]], who left Cousin in a dispute after their return to Dieppe, and who is claimed to have left for Spain from where he advised Columbus on his westward sail.&lt;ref name="Wintroub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shipley"&gt;''The English Rediscovery and Colonization of America'' by Marie A. Shipley p.5  [https://books.google.com/books?id=POKossFY9JEC&amp;pg=PA3]&lt;/ref&gt; Pinzon is known to have displayed a remarkable confidence in guiding Columbus in his discovery of the New World.&lt;ref name="Shipley"/&gt; No indisputable written records remain however to support Cousin's claim to discovery.&lt;ref name="Wintroub"/&gt;

Cousin's travel was succeeded by that of [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville]] in 1504 onboard ''L'Espoir'', which was properly recorded and brought back an Indian named Essomericq.&lt;ref name="Wintroub"/&gt; Gonneville affirmed that when he visited Brazil, French traders from [[Saint-Malo]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] had already been trading there for several years.&lt;ref name="McAbe"&gt;''Orientalism in early Modern France'' 2008 Ina Baghdiantz McAbe, p.71''ff'', {{ISBN|978-1-84520-374-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precedent of Jean Cousin and his Normand sailors was used by [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] to justify the French attempts at colonizing [[Florida]] at [[Fort Caroline]] in 1564-65, as, it was said, they had discovered the New World before the Spanish did.&lt;ref name="McAbe"/&gt; The area was called ''"Terre des Bretons"'' by the French.&lt;ref name="McAbe"/&gt; 

The claim of Jean Cousin's discovery of the New World has long been reaffirmed in France. In 1660, [[Estienne Cleirac]] in ''Us et coustumes de la mer'' emphasized it.&lt;ref name="McAbe"/&gt; The claim is also sometimes reaffirmed in contemporary popular literature.

'''Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʊr|i|eɪ|,_|-|i|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Fourier}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|fuʁje|lang}}; 21 March 1768 – 16 May 1830) was a [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] born in [[Auxerre]] and best known for initiating the investigation of [[Fourier series]] and their applications to problems of [[heat transfer]] and [[vibration]]s. The [[Fourier transform]] and [[Thermal conduction#Fourier.27s law|Fourier's law]] are also named in his honour. Fourier is also generally credited with the discovery of the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowie |first=J. |year=2007 |title=Climate Change: Biological and Human Aspects |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-69619-7 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Fourier was born at [[Auxerre]] (now in the [[Yonne]] [[département]] of France), the son of a [[tailor]]. He was [[orphaned]] at the age of nine. Fourier was recommended to the [[Bishop of Auxerre]] and, through this introduction, he was educated by the [[Benedictine Order]] of the Convent of St. Mark. The commissions in the scientific corps of the army were reserved for those of good birth, and being thus ineligible, he accepted a military lectureship on mathematics. He took a prominent part in his own district in promoting the [[French Revolution]], serving on the local Revolutionary Committee. He was imprisoned briefly during the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]] but, in 1795, was appointed to the ''[[École Normale Supérieure|École Normale]]'' and subsequently succeeded [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] at the ''[[École Polytechnique]]''.

Fourier accompanied [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] on his [[French_campaign_in_Egypt_and_Syria|Egyptian expedition]] in 1798, as scientific adviser, and was appointed secretary of the [[Institut d'Égypte]]. Cut off from France by the British fleet, he organized the workshops on which the French army had to rely for their munitions of war. He also contributed several mathematical papers to the Egyptian Institute (also called the Cairo Institute) which Napoleon founded at [[Cairo]], with a view of weakening British influence in the East. After the British victories and the capitulation of the French under [[Abdullah Jacques-François de Boussay, baron de Menou|General Menou]] in 1801, Fourier returned to France.

However, Fourier had previously returned home from the Napoleon expedition to Egypt to resume his academic post as professor at [[École Polytechnique]] when [[Napoleon]] decided otherwise in his remark

Hence being faithful to Napoleon, he took the office of Prefect.&lt;ref name="The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive" /&gt; It was while at Grenoble that he began to experiment on the propagation of heat. He presented his paper ''On the Propagation of Heat in Solid Bodies'' to the Paris Institute on December 21, 1807. He also contributed to the monumental ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]''.&lt;ref name=Nowlan&gt;{{cite book |last=Nowlan |first=Robert |title=A Chronicle of Mathematical People |url=http://www.robertnowlan.com/pdfs/Fourier,%20Joseph.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822, Fourier succeeded [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]] as Permanent Secretary of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. In 1830, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In 1830, his diminished health began to take its toll:
{{quote|Fourier had already experienced, in Egypt and Grenoble, some attacks of aneurism of the heart. At Paris, it was impossible to be mistaken with respect to the primary cause of the frequent suffocations which he experienced. A fall, however, which he sustained on the 4th of May 1830, while descending a flight of stairs, aggravated the malady to an extent beyond what could have been ever feared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arago | first = François | title = Biographies of Distinguished Scientific Men | year = 1857 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16775/16775-h/16775-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Shortly after this event, he died in his bed on 16 May 1830.

Fourier was buried in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, a tomb decorated with an Egyptian motif to reflect his position as secretary of the Cairo Institute, and his collation of ''Description de l'Égypte''. His name is one of the [[The 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].

A bronze statue was erected in Auxerre in 1849, but it was melted down for armaments during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.ccstib.fr/international-subscription-joseph-fourier-statue-2/ subscription] has been launched to erect a new one.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Fourier University]] in Grenoble is named after him.

==''The Analytic Theory of Heat''==
[[File:Joseph Fourier (circa 1820).jpg|200px|right|thumb|Sketch of Fourier, circa 1820.]]
In 1822 Fourier published his work on [[heat flow]] in ''Théorie analytique de la chaleur'' (''The Analytical Theory of Heat''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fourier | first = Joseph | title = Théorie analytique de la chaleur | publisher = Firmin Didot Père et Fils | year = 1822 | location = Paris | language = French | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TDQJAAAAIAAJ | oclc=2688081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he based his reasoning on [[Newton's law of cooling]], namely, that the flow of heat between two adjacent molecules is proportional to the extremely small difference of their temperatures. This book was translated,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, A. (1878). ''The Analytical Theory of Heat'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, cited by Truesdell, C.A. (1980), ''The Tragicomical History of Thermodynamics, 1822–1854'', Springer, New York, {{isbn|0-387-90403-4}}, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; with editorial 'corrections',&lt;ref name="Truesdell 1980"&gt;Truesdell, C.A. (1980). ''The Tragicomical History of Thermodynamics, 1822–1854'', Springer, New York, {{isbn|0-387-90403-4}}, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; into English 56 years later by Freeman (1878).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Image Processing |first=Rafael |last=Gonzalez |first2=Richard E. |last2=Woods |edition=Third |location=Upper Saddle River |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2010 |page=200 |isbn=978-0-13-234563-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also edited, with many editorial corrections, by [[Jean Gaston Darboux|Darboux]] and republished in French in 1888.&lt;ref name="Truesdell 1980"/&gt;

There were three important contributions in this work, one purely mathematical, two essentially physical. In mathematics, Fourier claimed that any function of a variable, whether continuous or discontinuous, can be expanded in a series of [[Sine wave|sines]] of multiples of the variable. Though this result is not correct without additional conditions, Fourier's observation that some discontinuous functions are the sum of infinite series was a breakthrough. The question of determining when a Fourier series converges has been fundamental for centuries. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] had given particular cases of this (false) theorem, and had implied that the method was general, but he had not pursued the subject. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] was the first to give a satisfactory demonstration of it with some restrictive conditions.  This work provides the foundation for what is today known as the [[Fourier transform]].

One important physical contribution in the book was the concept of dimensional homogeneity in equations; i.e. an equation can be formally correct only if the dimensions match on either side of the equality; Fourier made important contributions to [[dimensional analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Stephen F.: A History of the Sciences (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1962), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The other physical contribution was Fourier's proposal of his [[heat equation|partial differential equation]] for conductive diffusion of heat. This equation is now taught to every student of mathematical physics.

==Real roots of polynomials==
[[File:Grenoble - ancien évêché - Joseph Fourier.JPG|left|thumb|170px|Bust of Fourier in Grenoble]]
Fourier left an unfinished work on determining and locating real roots of polynomials, which was edited by [[Claude-Louis Navier]] and published in 1831. This work contains much original matter—in particular, [[Fourier's theorem on polynomial real roots]], published in 1820.&lt;ref name=Fourier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fourier|first=Jean Baptiste Joseph|title=Sur l'usage du théorème de Descartes dans la recherche des limites des racines|year=1820|journal=Bulletin des Sciences, par la Société Philomatique de Paris|pages=156–165|url=https://archive.org/details/bulletindesscien20soci}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Budan de Boislaurent|François Budan]], in 1807 and 1811, had published independently his [[Budan's theorem|theorem]] (also known by the name of Fourier), which is very close to Fourier's theorem (each theorem is a corollary of the other). Fourier's proof&lt;ref name=Fourier /&gt; is the one that was usually given, during 19th century, in textbooks on the theory of equations.&lt;ref&gt;These questions were no more considered as important from the end of 19th century to the second half of 20th century, where they reappeared for the need of [[computer algebra]].&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sturm's theorem|complete solution of the problem]] was given in 1829 by [[Jacques Charles François Sturm]].

==Discovery of the greenhouse effect==
[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 18 - Joseph Fourier 03.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Fourier's grave, [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]]]]
In the 1820s Fourier calculated that an object the size of the Earth, and at its distance from the Sun, should be considerably colder than the planet actually is if warmed by only  the effects of incoming solar radiation. He examined various possible sources of the additional observed heat in articles published in 1824&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fourier J |year=1824 |title=Remarques Générales Sur Les Températures Du Globe Terrestre Et Des Espaces Planétaires |journal=[[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]] |volume=27 |pages=136–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fourier J |year=1827 |title=Mémoire Sur Les Températures Du Globe Terrestre Et Des Espaces Planétaires |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |volume=7 |pages=569–604|url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/StatutConsulter?N=sorel1.bnf.fr-1295037014309&amp;B=1&amp;E=PDF&amp;O=NUMM-3370}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he ultimately suggested that interstellar radiation might be responsible for a large portion of the additional warmth, Fourier's consideration of the possibility that the Earth's atmosphere might act as an insulator of some kind is widely recognized as the first proposal of what is now known as the [[greenhouse effect]],&lt;ref&gt;Weart, S. (2008). ''[http://www.aip.org/history/climate/co2.htm The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect]''. Retrieved on 27 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; although Fourier never called it that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fleming J R |year=1999 |title=Joseph Fourier, the "greenhouse effect", and the quest for a universal theory of terrestrial temperatures |journal=Endeavour |volume=23 |number=2 |pages=72–75 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-9327(99)01210-7 |doi=10.1016/s0160-9327(99)01210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baum"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum, Sr.|first1=Rudy M.|title=Future Calculations: The first climate change believer|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2 |pages=38–39 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/future-calculations|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his articles, Fourier referred to an experiment by [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure|de Saussure]], who lined a vase with blackened cork. Into the cork, he inserted several panes of transparent glass, separated by intervals of air. Midday sunlight was allowed to enter at the top of the vase through the glass panes. The temperature became more elevated in the more interior compartments of this device. Fourier concluded that gases in the atmosphere could form a stable barrier like the glass panes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/fourier_1827.html Translation by W M Connolley of: Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires]&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion may have contributed to the later use of the metaphor of the 'greenhouse effect' to refer to the processes that determine atmospheric temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=100 Ideas that Changed the World|first=Jheni|last=Osman|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=9781446417485|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SescGntKYTkC&amp;pg=PT65|quote=[Fourier] didn't call his discovery the greenhouse effect but future scientists named it that after an experiment by [de Saussure] which influenced Fourier's work}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier noted that the actual mechanisms that determine the temperatures of the atmosphere included [[convection]], which was not present in de Saussure's experimental device.

'''Lake Boga Mission''' station was established on the south-eastern shores of [[Lake Boga, Victoria|Lake Boga]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] in 1851 by the [[Moravian Church]] on the land of the [[Wemba-Wemba]]. The mission was established by two Moravian missionaries from Germany, Andreas Täger and Friedrich Spieseke. The missionaries hoped to establish gardens, keep livestock and open a school to attract and convert to Christianity and 'civilise' the local aboriginal people on their 640-acre grant of land.&lt;ref&gt;Victorian Department of Planning and Community Development, ''[http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/heritage/publications-and-research/framework-of-historical-themes/Case-Study-6 Case Study 6 - Lake Boga Social and Cultural Heritage Landscape]'', 10 September 2010, Accessed 24 September, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulties were experienced in attracting Wemba-Wemba people to the mission - no converts were ever made - and there were also issues with a dispute over a fence and the area given to the missionaries, hostility from local landholders, problems with local authorities, and with gold diggers traversing the property. The mission closed on 1 July 1856. Täger and Spieseke left the site and Australia returning to London, without permission from headquarters, and thus in disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Jensz, pp 71-105, ''German Moravian missionaries in the British colony of Victoria, Australia, 1848-1908'' in particular Chapter 3 ''Lake Boga, A Putrid Stain'', IDC Publishers, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers and VSP, 2010 via [https://books.google.com/books?id=nZMoygIj1O0C&amp;pg Google Books], {{ISBN|978-90-04-17921-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spieseke and another missionary, [[Friedrich Hagenauer]], were subsequently sent by the Moravian Church and established [[Ebenezer Mission]] at Lake Hindmarsh in 1859.

'''Lionel Groulx''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡʁu}}; 13 January 1878 – 23 May 1967) was a [[French Canadian]] [[Roman Catholic]] priest, historian and [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0003472|title=Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early life and ordination===
[[File:Acte de baptême Lionel Groulx 13 janvier 1878 Vaudreuil.jpg|thumb|left|Birth and baptismal certificate of Lionel Groulx, 13 January 1878, église Saint-Michel in Vaudreuil (Québec).]]
Lionel Groulx, né Joseph Adolphe Lyonel Groulx, the son of a farmer and lumberjack, and direct descendent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.vigile.net/groulx/ancetre.html|title=L. Groulx, Notre maître, le passé, 1924, pp. 71-76.|date=|accessdate=2012-10-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310123910/http://archives.vigile.net/groulx/ancetre.html|archivedate=10 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[New France]] pioneer [[Coulée Grou|Jean Grou]], was born and died at [[Vaudreuil-Dorion, Quebec|Vaudreuil, Quebec]]. After his seminary training and studies in Europe, he taught at [[Collège de Valleyfield|Valleyfield College]] in [[Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Quebec|Salaberry-de-Valleyfield]], and then the [[Université de Montréal]]. In 1917 he co-founded a monthly journal called ''[[L'Action nationale|Action Française]]'', becoming its editor in 1920.

===Study of Confederation===
Groulx was one of the first Quebec historians to study Confederation: he insisted on its recognition of Quebec rights and minority rights, although he believed a combination of corrupt political parties and French Canadian minority status in the Dominion had failed to deliver on those promises, as the [[Manitoba Schools Question|Manitoba conflict]] exposed. Groulx believed that only through national education and the Quebec government could the economic and social inferiority of [[French Canadian]]s be repaired. Groulx was quite successful promoting his brand of [[ultramontanism]].

His main focus was to restore Quebeckers' pride in their identity by knowledge of history, both the heroic acts of New France and the French Canadian and self-government rights obtained through a succession of important political victories: 1774, the Quebec Act recognized the rights of the Quebec province and its people with respect to French law, Catholic religion and the French language; in 1848, [[responsible government]] was finally obtained after decades of struggle, along with the rights of the French language; in 1867, the autonomy of the province of Quebec was restored as Lower Canada was an essential partner in the creation of a new [[British Dominions|Dominion]] through [[Confederation]] [La Confederation canadienne, Montreal, Quebec 10/10, 1978 (1918)]. 
 
Lionel Groulx called the [[Canadian Confederation]] of 1867 a failure and espoused the theory that French Canada's only hope for survival was to bolster a French State and a Roman Catholic Quebec as the means to emancipate the nation and a bulwark against English power. He believed the powers of the provincial government of Quebec could and should be used, within Confederation, to better the lot of the French Canadian nation, economically, socially, culturally and linguistically. 
 
His curriculum and writings de-emphasized or ignored conflicts between the clergy and those who were struggling for democratic rights, and de-emphasized any conflicts between the "habitants" or peasant class and the French-Canadian elites. He preferred the settled habitants to the more adventurous and, in his view, licentious [[coureurs de bois]].

In 1928, the Université de Montréal insisted that Groulx sign a paper saying that he would respect Confederation and English-Canadian sensibilities as a condition of receiving a respectable salary for his teaching work. He would not sign, but finally agreed to a condition that he would limit himself to historical studies; he resigned from the editorship of ''L'action canadienne-française'' soon after, and the magazine ceased publication at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Mason Wade, ''The French-Canadians 1760–1967'', vol. 2, p. 894.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lionel Groulx's major writings include ''[[The Call of the Race|L'Appel de la race]]'' (1922), ''Histoire de la Confédération'', ''Notre grande aventure'', ''Histoire du Canada français'' (1951), and ''Notre maître le passé''.

===Writings on New France===
In order to inculcate such pride in a nation he considered degraded by Conquest, he engaged in national myth-making, celebrating the days of New France as a golden age and elevating [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux|Dollard des Ormeaux]] into a legendary hero. He has been described as the first French Canadian historian to consider the period of the French regime superior to that of the English rule that followed it, evaluating the Conquest as a disaster rather than the common nineteenth century view of it as a blessing that saved Quebec from the atheist terror of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Olivar Asselin, ..L'Oeuvre de l'abbé Groulx.., 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also developed a Quebec history curriculum that emphasized the heroism of [[New France]], the challenge British Conquest posed to the survival of the "Canadiens", and how this challenge was met by lengthy political struggles for democratic rights. He particularly insisted, as had many before him, on the [[Quebec Act of 1774]] as the official recognition of his nation's rights. He bore particular affection for the undertaking of [[Robert Baldwin]] and [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine]], that in 1849 successfully restored the rights of the French language along with the obtention of responsible government, thus thwarting the assimilation plans of [[Lord Durham]]'s policy of forced Union between Upper and Lower Canada. (See [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]])

===Ligue d'action française===
At the Ligue d'Action française, Groulx and his colleagues hoped to inspire revival of the French language and French Canadian culture, but also to create a think tank and public space of reflection, so that the French Canadian nation's elites would find ways to remedy French Canada's underdevelopment and exclusion from big business.

Some collaborators of the review thus actively participated in the development of the HEC business school. Others were actively involved in the promotion of the Church's Social doctrine, an official Catholic answer to socio-economic distress that was meant to prevent the appeal of socialism and improve capitalism.

Groulx's conservative Catholicism was not very appreciative of other religions, although he also acknowledged that racism was not Christian, and he maintained that Quebec should aspire to be a model society by Christian standards, including intense missionary action. [Le Canada français missionnaire, Montreal, Fides, 1962].

===Catholic social teaching===
This Catholic social doctrine later became part of the 1930s [[Action liberale nationale]] (ALN) party, a new party that intellectuals close to Groulx and the defunct Action française appreciated. When [[Maurice Duplessis]]'s victory became apparent, some instead accepted to cooperate with his government and its reforms. But Groulx, and with him a large number of intellectuals, chose to oppose him.

During the [[Second World War]] Groulx, like many Canadien nationalists, spoke in favour of the [[Vichy regime]] of [[Philippe Pétain]], although public statements to this effect remained rare.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Groulx, ''Constantes de vie'' (Montreal: Fides, 1967), p. 111 and Eric Amyot, ''Le Quebec entre Petain et de Gaulle: Vichy, la France libre et les Canadiens Francais'', p. 173 (Editions Fides, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Groulx and other intellectuals settled into a partial alliance with [[Liberal Party of Quebec]] leader [[Adelard Godbout]], who served as Premier from 1939 to 1944. They soon broke with him on account of his submission to the [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]]. Yet in 1944 they opposed Duplessis  again, this time placing their hopes in another new party, the [[Bloc populaire|Bloc populaire Canadien]], led by [[André Laurendeau]]. Future Montreal Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] was part of this young party, which soon suffered the same fate as the previous third party, the ALN. After the 1948 election, the Bloc populaire Canadien disappeared.

===Economic protectionism===
Groulx was later remembered both for his strong case in favour of economic reconquest of Quebec by French Canadians, defense of the French language, and pioneer work as the first chair of Canadian history in Quebec (Universite de Montreal; see Ronald Rudin, Making History in Twentieth Century Quebec, Toronto University Press, 1997). Rudin underscores Groulx's founding role in scholarly History with the development of the Montréal History Department. Groulx founded the ''Institut d'histoire d'Amérique française'' in 1946, an institute located in [[Montreal]] devoted to the historical study of Quebec and of the French presence in the Americas and the publication of ''La revue d'histoire de l'Amérique française'', still today arguably the main publication for professional historians in Quebec. His main intellectual contribution was to create a rapprochement between nationalism and the Catholic religion, blunting the hostility between them that had existed in the nineteenth century.

===Later influence===
Through his writings and teaching at the university and his association with the intellectual elite of Quebec, he had a profound influence on many people (such as [[Michel Chartrand]] and [[Camille Laurin]]). However, many of the young intellectuals he influenced often did not share his conservative ideology (such as his successor at the University of Montreal). Groulx's traditionalist, religious form of Québécois nationalism, known as [[clerico-nationalism]], influenced Quebec society into the 1950s.

[[Collège Lionel-Groulx]], Lionel Groulx Avenue and the [[Lionel-Groulx (Montreal Metro)|Lionel Groulx]] metro station are named in his honour.

==Delisle-Richler controversy==
{{POV|date=April 2014}}
{{Main|Delisle-Richler controversy}}
There are charges of antisemitism made by [[Mordecai Richler]] and [[Esther Delisle]] against several pre-World War II Quebec intellectuals, including Groulx. However, Groulx expressed some opposition to antisemitism: "L'antisémitisme, non seulement n'est pas une solution chrétienne; c'est une solution négative et niaise." ("Not only is antisemitism not a Christian solution; it is a negative and silly solution.")&lt;ref&gt;BRASSER, «Lionel Groulx», ''L'Action nationale'', April 1993,; quoted by Gary CALDWELL, op.cit., p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''María de Estrada''' (c. 1475 or 1486 &amp;ndash; between 1537–48)&lt;ref&gt;Dates of c. 1475 and 1495 are based on the identification of María de Estrada as one of a pair of Spanish castaways rescued on Cuba, who were said to be 40 and 18 or 20 in 1513, Campuzano (1997), p. 47; she is recorded as ''encomendera'' of [[Tetela del Volcán]] in 1537, but her second husband had remarried by 1548. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFMvAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Mar%C3%ADa%22+%22de+Estrada%22+%221537%22] [https://books.google.com/books?id=4CpgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22María+de+Estrada%22+%221537%22] [https://books.google.com/books?ei=6uUFT431E8i18QOf55DyAg&amp;id=CHhdAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22encuentra+en+1550+y+1551.+La+%C3%BAltima+menci%C3%B3n+de+Mart%C3%ADn%22].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] woman who participated in the expedition of [[Hernán Cortés]] to [[Mexico]] in 1519–24. It is widely accepted that she [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|fought there]] as a [[conquistador]], and there is also some evidence that she had previously spent several years as a [[castaway]] among the native inhabitants of pre-colonial [[Cuba]].

==Background==
María Estrada (the surname is given as '''Destrada''' or '''Estrada''' in some sources) was born in [[Seville]], although her father came originally from northern Spain. Her brother, the [[conquistador]], Francisco de Estrada, had accompanied [[Christopher Columbus]] as a [[cabin boy]], and when he returned to the New World to settle permanently in 1509, Maria probably travelled with him.&lt;ref&gt;Campuzano (1997), p. 49; Himmerich y Valencia (1996), pp. 77, 154-5, 239; Porras Muñoz (1982), p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castaway in Cuba==
According to a widely accepted identification,&lt;ref&gt;Fully developed by Campuzano (1997) and Maura (1997), but it already alluded to by Giménez Caballero (1969) p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; María joined an early expedition to the [[Gulf of Darién]], perhaps accompanying her brother or an unrecorded husband.&lt;ref&gt;Campuzano (1997), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Their attempt to establish a settlement was a failure, and on the return journey to [[Santo Domingo]], her vessel was shipwrecked on the island of Cuba.

At first, the locals treated the marooned Spanish crew well, helping them to travel along the coast; but at the place later known as [[Matanzas]], the castaways were betrayed and massacred. The woman identified as Maria de Estrada was one of a handful of survivors, taken captive by one of the [[cacique|local chiefs]] who had led the attack.

For several years, she lived among the natives, one of the first Europeans to become [[Acculturation|acculturated]] to indigenous life in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Campuzano (1997), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513, she was released thanks to the arrival of [[conquistador]]s on the island. Soon afterwards, she married one of these Spanish colonists, named [[Pedro Sánchez Farfán]].

==Cortés expedition to Mexico==
In 1519, Pedro Sánchez Farfán joined the expedition of Hernán Cortés, and fought in the initial Spanish conquest of Mexico, but it is not clear whether his wife went with him. Some modern sources indicate that María de Estrada only arrived on the mainland in April 1520, with the rival expedition of [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], which included her brother Francisco, and which joined forces with Cortés at the end of May 1520.&lt;ref&gt;Himmerich y Valencia (1996), p. 239; for the chronology of the campaign, see Marley (1998) pp. 14-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

María was certainly with the combined army after it returned to the native capital at [[Tenochtitlan]] in June 1520: according to [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], she was the only [[White people|Spanish]] woman with them at this point. There had been the [[massacre in the Great Temple|bloody unrest]] in Cortés' absence, and now the conquistadors were struck by a full-scale native revolt known as the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'': after a week of street battles, the army was forced to fight its way back out of the city, suffering heavy casualties and losing most of its baggage and artillery.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|302}}

Most of the early sources refer to María de Estrada in general terms among the small number of women who accompanied the army at this time, but two writers of the later sixteenth century single her out as a soldier. The [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcallan]] chronicler [[Diego Muñoz Camargo]] wrote that she fought her way out of the city as a [[rodelero]] during the battle, proving herself "as good a warrior as any man", and that she participated in the decisive charge of armored cavalry at the [[Battle of Otumba]].  The Dominican historian [[Diego Durán]] claims that she subsequently led a force of conquistadors into the area around [[Popocatépetl]], where, she defeated the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] Indians of [[Hueyapan]], charging head first and screaming "[[James, son of Zebedee|Santiago]]!"                                         

Cortés certainly gave María and her husband an extensive ''[[encomienda]]'' in this area, based at [[Tetela del Volcán]], with subsidiary units at Nepopozalco and at Hueyapan itself, while Sanchéz Farfán also gained additional estates further to the west.&lt;ref&gt; Himmerich y Valencia (1996), p. 239. See also the historical summary ("Reseña Histórica") for the ''municipio'' of [[Tetela del Volcán]], in INAFED (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; When she was widowed in the 1530s, María de Estrada assumed direct control of the estate,&lt;ref&gt;The date is given as "ca. 1536", Himmerich y Valencia (1996), pp. 77 239.&lt;/ref&gt; and in this capacity, she filed a petition to the king of Spain to ask for lighter taxation of her lands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Eventually, María de Estrada remarried to Alonso Martín, a civilian settler in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], but by 1561, his relatives were fighting over the inheritance: instead, the ''encomienda'' was annexed to the royal domains of the king of Spain - it seems that neither María nor her first husband had surviving descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Himmerich y Valencia (1996), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic perspectives==
The basic fact that María de Estrada accompanied Cortés' army to Mexico is vouched for by eyewitness memoirs, but historians do not agree about the reliability of the evidence on which her detailed biography is based.

Luisa Campuzano, in the fullest discussion of the problem, concluded that the sources support each other, and provide a consistent factual and psychological portrait,&lt;ref&gt;Campuzano (1997), at p. 50; Campuzano (2004) appears to be a more recent revision of the same material, while Maura (1997) is a complimentary paper in the same volume.&lt;/ref&gt; but other historians have been more cautious, suggesting that María de Estrada's military prowess may be a literary fiction,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Brewster and Owen (2006), pp. 131–134.&lt;/ref&gt; and inferring that she arrived in the New World too late to be the castaway rescued in 1513.&lt;ref&gt;Bel Bravo (2002) p. 202 suggests that she was the María Estrada, native of [[San Vicente de la Barquera]], who sailed from Spain on 15 December 1512, while Himmerich y Valencia (1996), p. 239, states that she traveled from Cuba to Mexico with her brother in 1519; however, the biographical details indicate that the emigrée of 1512 was not Francisco's sister, so at least one of these assumptions must be discarded.&lt;/ref&gt; A later date for her arrival in the Americas would imply that María de Estrada was Sanchéz Farfán's second wife, a different woman from the castaway he had married in Cuba, although the sources providing these dates seem to be unaware of his earlier marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The possibility seems only to have been considered (and rejected) by Campuzano (1997), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to the problems, historians have sometimes muddled María de Estrada with other women associated with the conquistadors in Mexico: she has been confused with Marina de la Caballería, the wife of the prominent settler [[Alonso de Estrada]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}, who in turn has been misidentified with the native princess [[La Malinche|Doña Marina]],&lt;ref&gt;See Danaher Chaison (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moral agency''' is an individual's ability to make [[morality|moral]] judgments based on some notion of [[ethics|right and wrong]] and to be held accountable for these actions.&lt;ref name="Angus20"&gt;{{cite book|last=Angus|first=Taylor|title=Animals &amp; Ethics: An Overview of the Philosophical Debate|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2003|location=Peterborough, Ontario|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''moral agent''' is "a being who is capable of acting with reference to right and wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=moral&amp;use1913=on "Moral,"] ''Websters Revised Unabridged Dictionary'', 1913, p. 943.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and analysis==
Most [[philosopher]]s suggest only [[rationality|rational]] beings, who can [[reason]] and form self-interested judgments, are capable of being moral agents. Some suggest those with limited rationality (for example, people who are mildly [[mentally disabled]] or infants&lt;ref name="Angus20" /&gt;) also have some basic moral capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Animal Rights, Environmental Ethics Debate: The Environmental Perspective|year=1992|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-7914-0933-6|pages=3–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8G4iDy1a0FcC&amp;pg=PA3 |editor=Hargrove, Eugene C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Determinist]]s argue all of our actions are the product of antecedent causes, and some believe this is [[Compatibilism|incompatible]] with [[free will]] and thus claim that we have no real control over our actions. [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that whether or not our [[real self]], the [[noumenon|noumenal]] self, can choose, we have no choice but to believe that we choose freely when we make a choice. This does not mean that we can ''control'' the effects of our actions.
Some Indeterminists would argue we have no free will either. If, with respect to human behaviour, a so-called 'cause' results in an indeterminate number of possible, so-called 'effects', that does not mean the person had the free-thinking independent will to choose that 'effect'. More likely, it was the indeterminate consequence of his chance genetics, chance experiences and chance circumstances relevant at the time of the 'cause'.

In Kant's philosophy, this calls for an act of faith, the faith free agent is based on something ''a priori'', yet to be known, or immaterial. Otherwise, without free agent's ''a priori'' fundamental source, socially essential concepts created from human mind, such as justice, would be undermined (responsibility implies freedom of choice) and, in short, civilization and human values would crumble.

It is useful to compare the idea of moral agency with the [[legal]] doctrine of ''[[mens rea]]'', which means guilty mind, and states that a person is legally responsible for what he does as long as he ''should'' know what he is doing, and his choices are deliberate. Some theorists discard any attempts to evaluate mental states and, instead, adopt the doctrine of ''[[strict liability]]'', whereby one is liable under the law without regard to capacity, and that the only thing is to determine the degree of [[punishment]], if any. Moral determinists would most likely adopt a similar point of view.

Psychologist [[Albert Bandura]] has observed that moral agents engage in selective [[moral disengagement]] in regards to their own inhumane conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|title=Selective Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency|journal=Journal of Moral Education|date=June 2002|volume=31|issue=2|pages=101–119|doi=10.1080/0305724022014322|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0305724022014322#preview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between moral agency and eligibility for moral consideration==
Many philosophers, such as Kant, view morality as a transaction among rational parties, i.e., among moral agents. For this reason, they would exclude other animals from moral consideration.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Others, such as [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] philosophers like [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Peter Singer]] have argued the key to inclusion in the [[moral community]] is not rationality &amp;mdash; for if it were, we might have to exclude some disabled people and infants, and might also have to distinguish between the degrees of rationality of healthy adults &amp;mdash; but the real object of moral action is the avoidance of suffering. This is the [[argument from marginal cases]].

==Artificial moral agents==

The term artificial moral agent has taken on two usages.  The first is in debates on whether it is possible for an artificial system to be a moral agent - see [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems and moral responsibility|artificial systems and moral responsibility]].
The second usage stems from efforts to construct machines with ethically-significant behaviors - see [[machine ethics]].  
The proper distinction between these two usages has itself been a [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems and moral responsibility|key point of debate]].

'''Naacal''' is the name of an ancient [[people]] and [[civilization]] first claimed to have existed by [[Augustus Le Plongeon]] and later by [[James Churchward]]. Though there is no [[science|scientific]] or [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence for the existence of the Naacals, various later [[fiction]]al works have made use of them.

==Augustus Le Plongeon's description of the Naacal==
The first recorded use of the term "Naacal" is contained in [[Augustus Le Plongeon]]'s work from 1896, "Queen Moo and the [[Egypt]]ian [[Sphinx]]." From pages xxiii - xxiv of the preface:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Perhaps also will be felt the necessity of recovering the libraries of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sages (hidden about the beginning of the [[Christian]] era to save them from destruction at the hands of the devastating hordes that invaded their country in those times), and to learn from their contents the wisdom of those ancient philosophers, of which that preserved in the books of the [[Brahmin]]s is but the reflection. That wisdom was no doubt brought to [[India]], and from there carried to [[Babylon]] and [[Egypt]] in very remote ages by those [[Maya civilization|Maya]] adepts (Naacal - "the exalted"), who, starting from the land of their birth as missionaries of religion and civilization, went to [[Burma]]h, where they became known as [[Naga people|Naga]]s, established themselves in the [[Deccan Plateau|Dekkan]], whence they carried their civilizing work all over the earth."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Augustus Le Plongeon, the Naacals were the missionaries of Mayan religion and civilization. Le Plongeon advocated that the original, great civilization was in Central America which contrasts with Churchward's view.

==James Churchward's description of the Naacal==
The next known published use of the word occurred in 1926 when [[James Churchward]] used the term in his book, ''The Lost Continent of Mu, Motherland of Man''.

According to James Churchward, the Naacal were the [[people]] and [[civilization]] of the [[lost continent]] of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], as well as the name of their [[language]].

According to Churchward, the [[population]] of the Naacal civilization was as high as 64 million. Their civilization, which flourished 50,000 years ago, was technologically more advanced than the civilization of Churchward's own time (late 19th to early 20th century), and the ancient civilizations of [[India]], [[Babylon]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Mayas]] were merely the decayed remnants of Naacal [[colonies]].

Churchward claimed to have gained his knowledge of the Naacals after befriending an [[India]]n priest, who taught him to read the ancient dead language of the Naacals, spoken by only three people in all of India. The priest disclosed the existence of several ancient tablets, written by the Naacals, and Churchward gained access to these records after overcoming the priest's initial reluctance. His knowledge remained incomplete, as the available tablets were mere fragments of a larger text, but Churchward claimed to have found verification and further information in the records of other ancient peoples.

Churchward claimed that the ancient [[Egypt]]ian [[sun god]] [[Ra]] originated with the Naacals; he claimed that "Rah" was the word which the Naacals used for "[[sun]]" as well as for their god and rulers.

==Mention in "The Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East" Vol. 2 (1927)==
In volume 2 of "The Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East," [[Baird T. Spalding]] makes this remark about the 'Naacals':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The teachings that Buddha received came from the same source as did those of Osiris but in a different way. The teachings that Buddha contacted came from the Motherland direct to Burma, brought there by the Naacals. Osiris' teachings came direct to him, as his forefathers lived in the Motherland and when he was a young man he had gone to the Motherland to study."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
David Bruton, Spalding's biographer revealed in "Baird T. Spalding As I Knew Him" (IEP, 1956) that Spalding's books were a magical autobiography and essentially fiction. Therefore, the inference that the Naacals themselves are a fiction or modern myth is strengthened.

==In modern fiction==
* In the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] story "[[Through the Gates of the Silver Key]]", the occultist [[Harley Warren]] is said to be an expert [[Linguistics|linguist]] of the Naacal language.
* In the [[anime]] series ''[[RahXephon]]'', Ernst Von Bähbem, a Mulian, is sometimes called the "Brother of Naacal" and was the founder of the Naacal Company, which eventually became the Bähbem Foundation.
* In the [[Visual novel]] ''[[Ever 17: The Out of Infinity]]'', Coco uses a supposed directive in the Nacaal Tablet to call Takeshi father, and Tsugumi mother.
* In [[Andre Norton]]'s [[Bibliography of Andre Norton#Central Asia|Central Asia novels]], two main characters are Nacaals. She identifies [[Draupadi]] from the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Ganesha]] as Nacaal survivors who advise humanity. She describes two warring factions among the Nacaals who have different aims and pursuits. Her Nacaal civilization existed as islands in an inner Asian sea which eventually perished.
* In "The Dweller in the Tomb," [[Lin Carter]] describes engraved pieces of black jade called the [[Zanthu Tablets]], which are written in Nacaal.   
* In the Italian comics named "Martin Mystère", by Alfredo Castelli, Sergio Bonelli Editore, the Archeologist M.M. discovers the ancient reigns of "Atlantide" and "Mu", the second of which was inhabited by the Nacaals.

== Major contributions ==

Nikolay Kradin's major contributions belong to three fields:

*(1) anthropology and social history of the Eurasian nomads;
*(2) political anthropology and theory of the state formation;
*(3) Social archaeology of East and Inner Asia cultures;

Among other things Kradin has demonstrated that an alternative to the state seems to be represented by the supercomplex [[chiefdom]]s created by some nomads of Eurasia – the number of the structural levels within such [[chiefdom]]s appear to be equal, or even to exceed those within the average state, but they have an entirely different type of political organization and political leadership; such type of political entities do not appear to have been ever created by the agriculturists.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kradin N. et al.

&lt;/ref&gt;

* (4) social archaeology of the nomadic empires.

Kradin has written over 11 books and 400 articles dealing with his research interests. These include Nomadic Societies (1992 in Russian), The Xiongnu Empire (1966, 2001, 2002 in Russian), Political Anthropology (2001, 2004, 2010, 2011 in Russian), Chinggis Khan Empire (in co-authorship with T.Skrynnikova, 2006 in Russian), Nomads of Eurasia (2007 in Russian), Nomads of Inner Asia in Transition (2014), History of Khitans Empire Liao (in co-authorship with A.L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4430">'''Operation Hudson Harbor''' was a [[United States Air Force]] [[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear Strike]] training operation against [[North Korea]], [[China]], and the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Korean War]] that was never escalated further.  

==Background==
When the [[United States]] first committed military support to [[South Korea]] against the Communists, their efforts initially came with little success, as they were driven almost completely out of the peninsula.  After the landing at Inchon [[United Nations Command|UN forces]] moved north toward the Yalu River.  Toward the end of October large numbers of Chinese crossed into North Korea.  On November 1, they attacked the 8th Cavalry Regiment at Unsan, forcing that Regiment to retreat and decimating the third Battalion.  At the same time, other Chinese troops attacked other American units along the Chongchon River, forcing them to retreat also.  Fearing a drive which would cut off the 24th Infantry Division,which was advancing up the west coast, General Walker ordered them to withdraw southward.  For some reason the Chinese held off any major attacks for over three weeks.  At that time, they Pushed UN forces south below the [[Division of Korea|38th parallel]].  The entire time, US high command was worried about greater Soviet intervention and perhaps even use of nuclear weapons.  With more reinforcements coming from the People's Republic of China, American high command began to fear its ability to win.  They began to consider more options involving nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=B29&gt;{{cite web

==Plan==
In October 1951, the U.S. effected Operation Hudson Harbor to establish nuclear capability against any communist forces and to scare the Soviets from action. [[B-29 bomber]]s practiced individual runs (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs) from [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] to North Korea.  Every factor of these missions could not be the same as an actual nuclear strike, as there is no way to replicate all of the steps from preload testing through the actual release of the bombs while using conventional bombs.  The intention was to both be entirely prepared for any ordered strikes and also intimidate the communists with the ease of US ability to fly nuclear bombs overhead.&lt;ref name=B29/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vets/&gt;&lt;ref name=HNN/&gt;  

Nuclear cores were deployed and thus the Air Force had several nuclear weapons at their disposal.  Command of any nuclear strike was given to [[Curtis LeMay|General Curtis LeMay]].  The plan was to destroy large military targets, power plants, and also create a ring of blast zones through [[Manchuria]] to dissuade any further intervention from the Communists.  Although the use of nuclear weapons was approved, they were never needed because the Chinese and North Koreans eventually signed the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]].  In actuality, although the US almost lost the war and was prepared to follow through with the plan, by 1953 the US had pushed the communist forces back across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|current armistice line]] before a ceasefire was called, and thus it was unneeded.&lt;ref name=B29/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vets/&gt;&lt;ref name=HNN/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4510">[[Image:Petrus de Ebulo.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait, the tonsured ''poeta'' himself, in ''Liber ad honorem Augusti'', 1196.]]
'''Peter of Eboli''' or '''Petrus de Ebulo'''&lt;ref&gt;In current medieval Latin; more correctly ''Petrus Eburensis''.&lt;/ref&gt; (flourished {{Circa|1196–1220}}) was a [[didactic]] [[poet|versifier]] and [[chronicler]] who wrote in [[Latin language|Latin]].

A [[monk]] from [[Eboli]] ([[Campania]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]), Peter became a court poet to [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of Sicily. His flattering verse ''[[Liber ad honorem Augusti]], sive de rebus Siculis'' (''Book to honor the Emperor, or The Affairs of Sicily''), probably written in [[Palermo]], was his first work; it was dedicated to Henry VI, King of Sicily by right of his wife [[Constance of Sicily|Constance]], the [[Normans|Norman]] heiress and mother of the heir who would be "in every way blessed" according to Peter&amp;mdash;[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II, ''stupor mundi'']]&amp;mdash; whose birth is described in terms reshaped from [[Virgil]]'s fourth [[Eclogue]], which Christians read as foretelling the coming of Christ. The book celebrates in glowing terms the victory of Henry over his opponent, the illegitimate usurper [[Tancred of Sicily|Tancred]], who, though a doughty fighter, was of such short stature that Peter ridicules him as ''Tancredulus'' ("Little Tancred"). The copy from Palermo is illuminated with palace scenes, processions, and battles in tableaux that vie with the text itself and form a precious record of twelfth-century life, as those of the [[Bayeux tapestry]] do for the eleventh.

Peter of Eboli also wrote a didactic poem, ''[[De balneis Puteolanis]]'' ("The Baths of [[Pozzuoli]]") that is the first widely distributed guidebook to thermal baths, a weapon in the local economic rivalries that arose over healing, medicinal bathing and the medieval tourist industry in southern Italy during the High Middle Ages. A copy is included in the historical miscellany at the [[Huntington Library]], HM 1342.

Peter is known to have written three poems because he lists them all at the end of ''De balneis Puteolanis'' in the following [[elegiac couplets]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|la|Suscipe, sol mundī, tibi quem praesentŏ libellum:
dē tribus ad dominum  tertius iste venit.
Prīmus habet patriōs cīvīlī marte triumphōs;
mīra Fedērīcī  gesta secundus habet;
tam loca quam vīrēs quam nōmina pēne sepulta
tertius Euboÿcīs  iste reformat aquīs.}}
|
Sun of the World, pick up this little book I offer you:
This is the third of the three to reach my Lord.
The first contains our national victories in civil war;
The second contains the remarkable deeds of Frederick;
This third sets in order the waters of the Euboean colony,
Their locations, their powers and their almost buried names.}}

The second poem of the three listed here, the ''mira Federici gesta'' ("remarkable deeds of Frederick") is lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7756">The '''planetary phase of civilization''' is a speculative concept defined by the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), an environmental organization that specialized in [[scenario analysis]] and [[forecasting]]. Proponents state that increasing global interdependence and risks, such as [[climate change]], are binding the world into a unitary [[socio-ecological system]]. This unprecedented condition signals a historic shift from the period of [[modernity]], characterized by sovereign states, perennial growth of population and economies, abundant resources, and disregard for environmental impacts. The Planetary Phase has many manifestations: [[economic globalization]], biospheric destabilization, mass migration, new global institutions (like the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]), the Internet, new forms of transboundary conflict, and shifts in culture and consciousness. Others consider each of these phenomena separately, but give little credence to the theory of a holistic shift in historical dynamics.

==Background==
The notion of the planetary phase of civilization rests on extensive sociological and anthropological study done by the GSG. Convened in 1995 by [[Paul Raskin]], President of [[Tellus Institute]], the GSG examined alternative plausible futures by observing trends in societal change in various domains.  Their scenarios, published in a series of essays, have been used in numerous regional, local, and global studies including the [[United Nations Environmental Program]] (UNEP)'s [[Global Environment Outlook]] Series (GEO). The Global Scenario Group synthesized its findings for a non-technical audience in the essay ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead'' (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002), http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay. See also its sequel: Paul Raskin, ''Journey to Earthland: The Great Transition to Planetary Civilization''. (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2016), http://www.greattransition.org/publication/journey-to-earthland.&lt;/ref&gt;   An October 2005 article in the ''Monthly Review'' entitled "Organizing Ecological Revolution" described the current "global environmental crisis" and the GSG's efforts as "the most ambitious attempt thus far to carry out such a broad assessment" of our current and future ecological situation.&lt;ref&gt;John Bellamy Foster, "Organizing Ecological Revolution," ''Monthly Review'' 57, no. 5 (October 2005), http://www.monthlyreview.org/1005jbf.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical transitions==
In a historical perspective, the planetary phase of civilization is viewed by its proponents as the third significant transition in civilization.  Though history is complex and difficult to divide into discrete eras, they argue that a broad panorama reveals two earlier macro-shifts in human society and culture: shifts from the [[Stone Age]] to Early Civilization and then from Early Civilization the [[Modern Era]].  Each transition brought a leap in the complexity of society, as seen in changes in social organization, economy, and communications. The Stone Age was characterized by tribes and villages, [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] economies, and spoken language as the means of communication.  The shift into Early Civilization brought more structured city-states and kingdoms, settled agriculture, and writing.  Correspondingly, the planetary phase sees social organization, the economy, and communications move to the global level. Moreover, unlike prior transitions, the planetary phase is understood to mark a new geologic era, the [[Anthropocene]], in which human activity becomes the primary driver of changes to the Earth system.

In ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead'', the GSG argues that historical transitions appear to be accelerating, with the longevity of each successive period less than the previous one. Thus, the duration of the Stone Age was on the order of 100,000 years; Early Civilization, 10,000; and Modernity, 1,000. It notes that if the planetary phase takes shape over 100 years, the pattern of acceleration would continue.

The GSG argues that, while history has entered the planetary phase, the ultimate shape of global civilization remains deeply uncertain. It explores alternative futures through scenario analysis, grouping the possibilities into three broad scenario types: Conventional Worlds, Barbarization, and Great Transitions. Conventional Worlds assume the persistence of currently dominant institutions and cultural values, where the world attempts to address challenges through spontaneous market adaptations or incremental governmental policy changes. The GSG finds Conventional Worlds to be a highly risky path in the planetary phase, a path that could well segue into some form of social devolution ("Barbarization"). Thus, the GSG contends that the most desirable scenario would be a [[Great Transition]] that incorporates new institutions to promote environmental sustainability, social equity, and lifestyles, once a sufficient level of material prosperity is attained, that emphasize qualitative fulfillment rather than quantitative consumption. These changes would be rooted in the ascendance of a new suite of values – solidarity, ecology, well-being – that would gradually displace the modernist triad of individualism, domination of nature, and consumerism. The political and cultural shift envisioned in this scenario, however, depends on the emergence of a [[global citizens movement]] as a potential actor to counter the power of transnational corporations, state governments, and mainstream values.

{{Progressivism}}
'''Progressivism''' is the support for or [[advocacy]] of improvement of society by [[social reform|reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of progressivism in English|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/progressivism|website=oxforddictionaries.com|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[philosophy]], it is based on the [[idea of progress]], which asserts that advancements in [[science]], [[technology]], [[economic development]] and [[social organization]] are vital to the improvement of the [[human condition]].

The meanings of progressivism have varied over time and from different perspectives.  Progressivism became highly significant during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe, out of the belief that Europe was demonstrating that societies could progress in [[civility]] from uncivilized conditions to civilization through strengthening the basis of [[empirical evidence|empirical knowledge]] as the foundation of society.&lt;ref name="Harold Mah 1914. p157"&gt;Harold Mah. [https://books.google.com/?id=WVlGIelNNNcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Enlightenment Phantasies: Cultural Identity in France and Germany, 1750–1914]. Cornell University. (2003). p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures of the Enlightenment believed that progress had [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] application to all societies and that these ideas would spread across the world from Europe.&lt;ref name="Harold Mah 1914. p157"/&gt; 

The contemporary common political conception of progressivism in the [[Western culture|culture of the Western world]] emerged from the vast [[social change]]s brought about by [[industrialization]] in the Western world in the late-19th century. Progressives in the early-20th century took the view that progress was being stifled by vast [[economic inequality]] between the rich and the poor; minimally regulated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] with [[monopoly|monopolistic]] [[corporation]]s; and intense and often violent conflict between workers and capitalists, thus claiming that measures were needed to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Nugent, Walter|year=2010|isbn=9780195311068| pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early-20th century progressivism was also tied to [[eugenics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |year=2005 |last=Leonard |first=Thomas |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=207–224 |doi=10.1257/089533005775196642 |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |accessdate=2017-10-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820132528/https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |archivedate=20 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2005|last=Freeden|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Freeden|title=Liberal Languages: Ideological Imaginations and Twentieth-Century Progressive Thought|pages=144–165|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=[[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Lpu8wwvA1AC&amp;pg=144|isbn=0691116776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4026900|title=Geneticists and the Eugenics Movement in Scandinavia|last=Roll-Hansen|first=Nils|journal=[[The British Journal for the History of Science]]|volume=22|issue=3|pages=335–346|date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[temperance movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/progress/prohib/ |title=Prohibition: A Case Study of Progressive Reform |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=2017-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James H. Timberlake, ''Prohibition and the Progressive Movement, 1900–1920'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary progressives promote [[public policies]] that they believe will lead to positive social change.

== Progressivism in philosophy and politics ==
=== From the Enlightenment to the Industrial Revolution ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] identified progress as being a movement away from barbarism towards civilization. 18th-century philosopher and political scientist [[Marquis de Condorcet]] predicted that political progress would involve the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). History of the Idea of Progress. New York: Basic Books. ch 5&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Modernity]]" or "modernization" was a key form of the idea of progress as promoted by [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to [[free market]]s and [[Freedom of movement|free movements]] of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joyce Appleby |author2=Lynn Hunt |author3=Margaret Jacob  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Telling the Truth about History |year=1995 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=O0aCcnVcbZcC&amp;pg=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was influential in promoting the idea of progress in European philosophy by emphasizing a [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear-progressive conception of history]] and rejecting a cyclical conception of history. [[Karl Marx]] applied to his writings the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] conception of linear-progressive history, the modernization of the economy through industrialization and criticisms of the social class structure of industrial capitalist societies. As industrialization grew, concerns over its effects grew beyond [[Marxism|Marxists]] and other radical critiques and became mainstream.

=== Contemporary mainstream political conception ===

In the late 19th century, a political view rose in popularity in the Western world that progress was being stifled by vast [[economic inequality]] between the rich and the poor, minimally regulated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] with out-of-control [[Monopoly|monopolistic]] [[corporation]]s, intense and often violent conflict between workers and capitalists and a need for measures to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Nugent, Walter|year=2010|isbn=9780195311068|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressivism has influenced various political movements. [[social liberalism|Modern liberalism]] was influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]]'s conception of people being "progressive beings".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan. ''The Making of Modern Liberalism''. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] developed [[progressive conservatism]] under "[[One-nation conservatism|one-nation]]" [[Toryism]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. ''British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies''. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. pp. 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake. Disraeli. Second Edition. London, England, UK: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]], Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] enacted various progressive [[social welfare]] measures out of conservative motivations to distance workers from the socialist movement of the time and as humane ways to assist in maintaining the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Union Contributions to Labor Welfare Policy and Practice: Past, Present, and Future. Routledge, 16, 2013. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of [[social democracy]] have identified themselves as promoting the progressive cause.&lt;ref&gt;Henning Meyer, Jonathan Rutherford. The Future of European Social Democracy: Building the Good Society. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Roman Catholic Church]] encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1891 condemned the exploitation of labour and urged support for labour unions and government regulation of businesses in the interests of social justice while upholding the rights of private property and criticizing socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Jaycox. The Progressive Era. New York, New York: Infobase Publishing, 2005. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Protestantism|Protestant]] progressive outlook called the [[Social Gospel]] emerged in North America that focused on challenging economic exploitation and poverty and by the mid-1890s was common in many Protestant theological seminaries in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Howard Hopkins, ''The Rise of the Social Gospel in American Protestantism, 1865–1915'' (1940). &lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, progressivism began as a social movement in the 1890s and grew into a political movement in what was known as the [[Progressive Era]]. While the term "American progressives" represent a range of diverse political pressure groups (not always united), some American progressives rejected [[social Darwinism]], believing that the problems society faced (poverty, violence, greed, racism and class warfare) could best be addressed by providing good education, a safe environment, and an efficient workplace. Progressives lived mainly in the cities, were college educated and believed that government could be a tool for change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/progressive-era.cfm he Progressive Era (1890–1920)], The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project (retrieved 31 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; American President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and later the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] declared that he "always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lurie. William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative. New York, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was also a member of the American progressive movement within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

Progressive stances have evolved over time. [[Imperialism]] was a controversial issue within progressivism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the United States where some progressives supported [[American imperialism]] while others opposed it.&lt;ref name="nugent"&gt;{{cite book|title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Nugent, Walter|year=2010|isbn=9780195311068|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to [[World War I]], progressive President Woodrow Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] established the concept of national [[self-determination]] and criticized imperialist competition and colonial injustices; these views were supported by [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialists]] in areas of the world that were resisting imperial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Reconsidering Woodrow Wilson: Progressivism, Internationalism, War, and Peace. p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of acceptance of economic [[Keynesianism]] (1930s to 1970s), there was widespread acceptance in many nations of a large role for [[economic interventionism|state intervention in the economy]]. With the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and challenges to state [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] policies in the 1970s and 1980s, [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] progressive movements responded by creating the [[Third Way]] that emphasized a major role for the [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 3–4, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[Social democracy|social democrats]] who have called for the social democratic movement to move past Third Way.&lt;ref&gt;After the Third Way: The Future of Social Democracy in Europe. I. B. Taurus, 2012. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent [[Progressive conservatism|progressive conservative]] elements in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] have criticized neoliberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Bochel. The Conservative Party and Social Policy. The Policy Press, 2011. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Landwehr''' is the author of numerous books about the [[Waffen-SS]], its non-[[Germany|German]] volunteers in particular, providing revisionist and apologetic accounts of these men and their battles. He has been producing the magazine ''Siegrunen'' on the same topic for over 30 years. Landwehr has written for the Journal for Historical Review (JHR) which is published by the [[Institute for Historical Review]], an American [[Holocaust denial]] organization.

The military historian [[Simon MacKenzie|S.P. MacKenzie]] describes Landwehr as an "extreme admirer [from] the fringes of the far-right."{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=139}} MacKenzie connects Landwehr with the contemporary [[HIAG#Revisionist tradition outside of HIAG|Waffen-SS historical revisionism]], first propounded by [[HIAG]], the Waffen-SS lobby group from the 1950s–1990s. Commenting on this contemporary trend, Mackenzie writes that "as older generation of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has done much to perpetuate the image of the force as a revolutionary European army" and includes Landwehr in this group.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=139–140}}

The '''Samson Option''' ([[Hebrew]]: ברירת שמשון) is the name that some military analysts and authors have given to [[Israel]]'s [[Deterrence theory|deterrence strategy]] of [[massive retaliation]] with [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear weapons]] as a "last resort" against a country whose military has invaded and/or destroyed much of Israel.&lt;ref name=doctrine&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/israel/doctrine.htm | title=Strategic Doctrine| publisher = Global Security | date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators also have employed the term to refer to situations where non-nuclear, non-Israeli actors, have threatened conventional weapons retaliation, such as [[Yasser Arafat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Herb |last=Keinon |url=http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/31/News/News.42612.html |title=Selling the 'Samson option' |newspaper=The Jerusalem post |date=2002-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040623065523/http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/31/News/News.42612.html |archivedate=2004-06-23 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Young | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2147260/ | title = The Samson Option: Is Hezbollah on the verge of destroying Lebanon? | newspaper = Slate Magazine | date = August 7, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is a reference to the [[Bible|biblical]] Israelite [[Biblical judges|judge]] [[Samson]] who pushed apart the pillars of a [[Philistines|Philistine]] temple, bringing down the roof and killing himself and thousands of Philistines who had captured him,{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 137}} crying out "Let me die with the Philistines!" (''Judges 16:30'').&lt;ref&gt;{{wwbible |Old Testament, 319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear ambiguity==
Israel refuses to confirm or deny it has [[nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear weapons]] or to describe how it would use them, an official policy of [[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|nuclear ambiguity]], also known as "nuclear opacity." This has made it difficult for anyone outside the Israeli government to describe the country's true nuclear policy definitively, while still allowing Israel to influence the perceptions, strategies and actions of other governments.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998 | pp = 1–3, 7, 341}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Avner | last = Cohen | url =  http://www.geocities.com/alabasters_archive/nuclear_opacity.html | chapter = Israel's Nuclear Opacity: a Political Genealogy | title = The Dynamics of Middle East Nuclear Proliferation | pages = 187–212 | editor1-first = Steven L | editor1-last = Spiegel | editor2-first = Jennifer D | editor2-last = Kibbe | editor3-first = Elizabeth G | editor3-last = Matthews | series = Symposium | volume = 66 | publisher = The Edwin Mellen Press | year = 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the years, some Israeli leaders have publicly acknowledged their country's nuclear capability: [[Ephraim Katzir]] in 1974, [[Moshe Dayan]] in 1981, [[Shimon Peres]] in 1998, and [[Ehud Olmert]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=nword&gt;{{cite news|title=Mum's the N-word|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=December 15, 2006|page=14|author=Yaakov Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 2006 confirmation hearings before the [[United States Senate]] regarding his appointment as [[George W. Bush]]'s Secretary of Defense, [[Robert Gates]] admitted that Israel had nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=nword/&gt; In his 2008 book ''The Culture of War'', [[Martin van Creveld]], a [[professor]] of military history at Israel's [[Hebrew University]], wrote that since Gates admitted that Israel had nuclear weapons, any talk of Israel's nuclear weapons in Israel can lead to "arrest, trial, and imprisonment." Thus Israeli commentators talk about "doomsday weapons" and the Samson Option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Martin | last = Van Creveld | title = The Culture of War | publisher = Random House Digital | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ytyMD5hxyRMC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=Martin+van+Creveld+Samson+Option&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SVWET7XrEKHV0QGZoaWrBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | page = 284 | ISBN = 978-0-345-50540-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, as early as 1976, the [[CIA]] believed that Israel possessed 10 to 20 nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;In March 1976 the CIA accidentally publicly admitted that Israel had 10–20 nuclear weapons "ready to use." Arthur Kranish, "CIA: Israel Has 10–20 A-Weapons," The Washington Post, March 15, 1976, p. 2 and David Binder, "C.I.A. says Israel has 10–20 A-bombs," The New York Times, March 16, 1976, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2002, it was estimated that the number had increased to between 75 and 200 [[thermonuclear weapons]], each in the multiple-megaton range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Norris | first1 = Robert S | first2 = William | last2 = Arkin | author3-link = Hans M.

==Deterrence doctrine==
{{main|Nuclear strategy|Deterrence theory|Assured destruction}}

Although nuclear weapons were viewed as the ultimate guarantor of Israeli security, as early as the 1960s, the country avoided building its military around them, instead pursuing absolute conventional superiority so as to forestall a last resort nuclear engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/israel/doctrine.htm |contribution=Israel's Strategic Doctrine |publisher=Global Security |title=Weapons of mass destruction}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original conception of the Samson Option was only as deterrence. According to [[United States]] journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] and Israeli historian [[Avner Cohen]], Israeli leaders like [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Shimon Peres]], [[Levi Eshkol]] and [[Moshe Dayan]] coined the phrase in the mid-1960s. They named it after the [[Bible|biblical]] figure [[Samson]], who pushed apart the pillars of a [[Philistines|Philistine]] temple, bringing down the roof and killing himself and thousands of Philistines who had captured him, mutilated him, and gathered to see him further humiliated in chains. They contrasted it with ancient siege of [[Masada]] where 936 Jewish [[Sicarii]] committed [[mass suicide]] rather than be defeated and enslaved by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].{{Sfn|Hersh|1991|pp=136–7}}{{Sfn|Cohen|1998|p=236–237}}

In what they called the "Last Secret of the Six-Day War" the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that in the days before the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] Israel planned to insert a team of paratroopers by helicopter into the [[Sinai]]. Their mission was to set up and remote  detonate a nuclear bomb on a mountaintop as a warning to belligerent surrounding states.  The greatly outnumbered Jewish state in a surprising turn of events effectively eliminated the [[Egyptian Air Force]] and occupied the Sinai winning the war before the test could even be set up. Retired Israeli brigadier general Itzhak Yaakov referred to this operation as the Israeli Samson Option.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/world/middleeast/1967-arab-israeli-war-nuclear-warning.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], Arab forces were overwhelming Israeli forces and Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] authorized a nuclear alert and ordered 13 atomic bombs be readied for use by missiles and aircraft. The Israeli Ambassador warned President Nixon of "very serious conclusions" if the United States did not airlift supplies. Nixon complied. This is seen by some commentators on the subject as the first threat of the use of the Samson Option.{{Sfn|Hersh|1991|pp=225–7}}{{Sfn|Cohen|1998|p=236}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Mark |last=Gaffney |title=Dimona, The Third Temple: The Story Behind the Vanunu Revelation |year=1989 |publisher=Amana Books |page=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Warner D |last=Farr |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cpc-pubs/farr.htm |title=The Third Temple's Holy of Holies: Israel's Nuclear Weapons |series=Counterproliferation Paper |number=2 |publisher=USAF Counterproliferation Center, [[Air War College]] |date=September 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Avner Cohen]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/06/opinion/the-last-nuclear-moment.html The Last Nuclear Moment], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 6, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seymour Hersh writes that the "surprising victory of [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud Party]] in the May 1977 national elections ... brought to power a government that was even more committed than Labor to the Samson Option and the necessity of an Israeli nuclear arsenal."{{Sfn|Hersh|1991|p=259}}

[[Louis René Beres]], a professor of [[political science]] at [[Purdue University]], chaired [[Project Daniel]], a group advising Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.  He argues in the Final Report of Project Daniel and elsewhere that the effective deterrence of the Samson Option would be increased by ending the policy of nuclear ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=ACPR |url=http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/03-ISSUE/daniel-3.htm |title=Daniel Project final report |place=[[Israel|IL]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 article he recommends Israel use the Samson Option threat to "support conventional preemptions" against enemy nuclear and non-nuclear assets because "without such weapons, Israel, having to rely entirely upon non-nuclear forces, might not be able to deter enemy retaliations for the Israeli [[preemptive strike]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Jerusalem summit |url=http://www.jerusalemsummit.org/eng/razdel.php?article_id=101&amp;id=15 |title=Israel and Samson. Biblical Insights on Israeli Strategy in the Nuclear Age}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authors' opinions ==
Ari Shavit writes of Israel's nuclear strategy: "Concerning anything and everything nuclear, Israel would be much, much more cautious than the United States and NATO. Concerning anything and everything nuclear, Israel would be the responsible adult of the international community. It would well understand the formidable nature of the demon and keep it locked in the basement".&lt;ref&gt;''My Promised Land'', by [[Ari Shavit]], (London 2014), page 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have written about the "Samson Option" as a retaliation strategy. In 2002, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published an opinion piece by [[Louisiana State University]] professor [[David D. Perlmutter|David Perlmutter]] which the American Jewish author [[Ron Rosenbaum]] writes "goes so far as to justify" a Samson Option approach:{{Sfn | Rosenbaum | 2012 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ntpyaiwadXsC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Perlmutter+%22Samson+Option%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WsDhUPuGNZK30AHPuIDICA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Perlmutter%20%22Samson%20Option%22&amp;f=false 22–3]}}

{{quote |Israel has been building nuclear weapons for 30 years. The Jews understand what passive and powerless acceptance of doom has meant for them in the past, and they have ensured against it. [[Siege of Masada|Masada]] was not an example to follow—it hurt the Romans not a whit, but Samson in Gaza? What would serve the Jew-hating world better in repayment for thousands of years of massacres but a [[Nuclear Winter]]. Or invite all those tut-tutting European statesmen and peace activists to join us in the ovens? For the first time in history, a people facing extermination while the world either cackles or looks away—unlike the Armenians, Tibetans, World War II European Jews or Rwandans—have the power to destroy the world.

Rosenbaum writes in his 2012 book ''How the End Begins: The Road to a Nuclear World War III'' that, in his opinion, in the "aftermath of a second Holocaust", Israel could "bring down the pillars of the world (attack Moscow and European capitals for instance)" as well as the "holy places of Islam." He writes that "abandonment of proportionality is the essence" of the Samson Option.{{Dubious|date=January 2016}}{{Sfn | Rosenbaum | 2012 | pp = 21–2, 141–2}}

In 2003, a military historian, [[Martin van Creveld]], thought that the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] then in progress threatened Israel's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/extracts/story/0,,1046646,00.html | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | title = We have the capability to take the world down with us | newspaper = The Guardian | date=September 21, 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Creveld was quoted in David Hirst's ''The Gun and the Olive Branch'' (2003) as saying: 

{{quote |We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force. Let me quote General [[Moshe Dayan]]: 'Israel must be like a mad dog, too dangerous to bother.'  I consider it all hopeless at this point. We shall have to try to prevent things from coming to that, if at all possible. Our armed forces, however, are not the thirtieth strongest in the world, but rather the second or third.  We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/21/israelandthepalestinians.bookextracts | title= Extract: The Gun and the Olive Branch | newspaper = [[The Observer]] | place = UK | date = 20 September 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, it was unlikely Israel could have even targeted Europe as according to Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Yaakov, who was the mastermind behind the "Samson Option", Israel did not yet have other measures like bombs or missiles to carry the nuclear payload.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4971018,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, in response to [[Günter Grass]]'s poem "Was gesagt werden muss" ("[[What Must Be Said]]") which criticized Israel's nuclear weapons program, Israeli poet and [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor Itamar Yaoz-Kest published a poem entitled "The Right to Exist: a Poem-Letter to the German Author" which addresses Grass by name. It contains the line: "If you force us yet again to descend from the face of the Earth to the depths of the Earth — let the Earth roll toward the Nothingness."  ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' journalist Gil Ronen saw this poem as referring to the Samson Option, which he described as the strategy of using Israel's nuclear weapons, "taking out Israel's enemies with it, possibly causing irreparable damage to the entire world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Gil | last = Ronen | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/154608#.T4H4MtXAE14 | title = Israeli Letter-poem to Grass: If We Go, Everyone Goes | newspaper = [[Arutz Sheva|Israel National News]] | date = April 8, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sink the Belgrano!''''' is a 1986 satirical play by [[English people|English]] playwright [[Steven Berkoff]] about [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s decision to torpedo the Argentinian ship [[ARA General Belgrano|General Belgrano]], as it was purportedly retreating during the 1982 [[Falklands War]] between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Argentina]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

According to the [[British Council]], ''Sink the Belgrano'' is among Berkoff's "lesser-known works", along with his other "controversial responses to recent events" such as "his poem ''Requiem for Ground Zero'' in 2002."&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth256|title=Steven Berkoff|work=Contemporary Writers|publisher=[[British Council]]|accessdate=2008-09-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717144514/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth256|archivedate=2009-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology''' or '''SLHA'''  aims to create a greater awareness of the history of Lincolnshire, and works to discover and record its heritage. The Society was formed in 1974, but it has antecedents which date back to 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sir Francis |last=Hill |author-link=Francis Hill |year=1966 |title=Early Days of a Society |journal=Lincolnshire History and Archaeology |volume=1 |pages=57–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and branches==
Currently the Society's activities include arranging  lectures and other events about Lincolnshire’s history and archaeology, the publication of a journal, a newsletter and books about Lincolnshire. The Society has its headquarters at the [[Jews' Court, Lincoln|Jews' Court]] in Lincoln, where it  has a lecture room, and runs a bookshop for new and secondhand books. It has two branch groups, the '''Sleaford History Group''' and the '''South Holland History  Group''' at [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], and also works with other local groups throughout the historic county of Lincolnshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slha.org.uk/about/index.php Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lincolnshire Topographical Society''' was established in 1840 under the patronage of [[Baron Monson|Lord Monson]]. Among its members were the architects [[Edward James Willson]] and [[William Adams Nicholson]]. It only published one volume of proceedings and appears to have been defunct by 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sturman |first=C. |chapter=Lincolnshire |editor1-last=Currie |editor1-first=C. R. J. |editor2-last=Lewis |editor2-first=C. P. |year=1994 |title=English County Histories: A Guide |publisher=Alan Sutton |place=Stroud |pages=246–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844 the '''Lincolnshire Society for the encouragement of Ecclesiastical Antiquities''' was founded in [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]]. Membership was by election and initially this was limited to members of the [[Anglican]] church. This is probably the reason why Edward James Willson, a Roman Catholic, did not join this Society. In 1849 the Society changed its name to the '''Lincolnshire Architectural Society''' and then in 1853 to the '''Lincolnshire Diocesan Architectural Society'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hill 1966, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; With the appointment of Archdeacon [[Edward Trollope]] as secretary of the Society in 1850, the Society moved to Lincoln and started to publish its proceedings in the ''Reports and Papers'' of the Associated Archaeological Societies. A further name change occurred in 1885 when it became the '''Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Architectural and Archaeological Society'''. This was to reflect the removal of the Archdeaconry of Nottingham from the [[Diocese of Lincoln]] and the creation of the new [[Diocese of Southwell]]. In 1902 Nottinghamshire was dropped from the title.&lt;ref&gt;Sturman 1994, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; During these early years a high proportion of the members of the Society were clergymen within the Diocese of Lincoln and most of the published articles are about Church history and architecture.

While the Lincolnshire Architectural and Archaeological Society continued to publish its papers with the Associated Archaeological Societies until 1936, other developments were taking place. In 1930 the '''Lindsey Local History Society''' was founded and it came to publish the ''Lincolnshire Historian''. In 1945 the '''Lincoln Archaeological Research Committee''' was founded and this started to conduct a series of notable excavation both in the City of Lincoln and in the County. The Lincolnshire Architectural and Archaeological Society merged with the Lindsey Local History Society in 1965 and,in 1974 the Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology was created by a further mergers with the Lincoln Archaeological Research Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Sturman 1994, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Lincolnshire Industrial Archaeology Group'''.

'''''Speculum: A Journal of Medieval Studies''''' is a quarterly [[academic journal]] published by [[University of Chicago Press]] on behalf of the [[Medieval Academy of America]]. It was established in 1926 and today is widely regarded as the most prestigious journal in medieval studies. The journal's primary focus is on the time period from 500 to 1500 in [[Western Europe]], but also on related subjects such as [[Byzantine]], [[Hebrew]], [[Arabic]], [[Armenian studies|Armenian]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] studies. {{As of|2016}}, the [[Editor-in-chief|editor]] is Sarah Spence.

The organization and its journal were first proposed in 1921 at a meeting of the [[Modern Language Association]], and the journal's focus was interdisciplinary from its beginning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2913990|title=Reviewed Work(s): Speculum: A Journal of Mediaeval Studies. by The Mediaeval Academy of America|first=Edwin|last=Greenlaw|journal=[[Modern Language Notes]]|volume=41|issue=4|year=1926|pages=271–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one reviewer noting a specific interest in [[Medieval Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reviewed Work(s): Speculum|first=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2941">[[File:Tomio Hora.jpg|thumb|right]]'''Tomio Hora''' (洞 富雄, ''Hora Tomio'', (born 14 November 1906 in [[Higashichikuma District, Nagano|Higashichikuma District]], [[Nagano Prefecture]], modern-day [[Chikuhoku, Nagano|Chikuhoku]]; died 15 March 2000) was a Japanese historian and [[Waseda University]] professor, well known for his pioneering work on the [[Nanjing Massacre]].

==Education==
Hora attended middle school at Matsumoto Kukashi High School (長野県松本深志高等学校) and high school at [[Waseda University High School]] (早稲田大学高等学院).

He was a graduate of [[Waseda University]]'s literature department. He received his [[Doctor of Letters]] from Waseda.

==Nanjing Massacre==
In 1972, Hora published his seminal ''Nankin Jiken'', in which he refuted revisionist denial of the [[Nanking Massacre]].&lt;ref name=yosh&gt;Takashi Yoshida. ''The making of the "Rape of Nanking"''. 2006, page 87&lt;/ref&gt; The work updated his 1967 ''Kindai senshi no nazo'' ("Riddles of Modern War History").&lt;ref name=yosh /&gt; This detailed treatment of the incident was a meaningful, in-depth response to revisionist accounts of Imperial Japanese action in China.

Hora's ''Nankin Jiken'' appeared amidst controversy in regards to the Nanjing Massacre scholarship of [[Honda Katsuichi]], whose ''Chugoku no tabi'' ("Travels in China") recorded Chinese eyewitness accounts of Japanese wartime atrocities.&lt;ref name=fog&gt;Fogel, Joshua A. ''The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography''. 2000, page 80-84&lt;/ref&gt; Honda's account garnered much support and stimulated debate in Japan, while at the same time attracting fearsome nationalistic defenses of Japanese military activity in the period, which materialized as historical debates, rhetorical attacks, and personal threats.&lt;ref name=fog /&gt; Hora's ''Nankin Jiken'' then appeared, which bolstered Honda's interview-based research with a documentary record, answering various attempts to undercut the Nanjing Massacre in Japanese historiography.&lt;ref name=fog /&gt;

Throughout the 1970s, Hora continued his struggle against revisionist works, publishing a number of scholarly monographs and documents on the events of the war.  In 1984, he became a founding member of the Study Group on the Nanking Incident, a diverse group of scholars, lawyers, and teachers, who held a variety of views but agreed that "they had to face the past wrongs committed by Japan".&lt;ref name=f2&gt;Fogel, Joshua A. ''The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography''. 2000, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's stated goal was the advancement of historical consciousness in Japan, in order to construct a "fortress for peace".&lt;ref name=f2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7898">'''Verena Winiwarter''' (born July 26, 1961 in [[Vienna]]) is an Austrian environmental historian. She has held the office of Dean of the [[Faculty for Interdisciplinary Research and Continuing Education|Faculty for Interdisciplinary Studies]] at the [[Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt]] since 2010. Her research focus is on the [[environmental history]] of [[Agrarian society|agrarian societies]] and on Austrian environmental history, as well as the [[philosophy of science]] of inter- and transdisciplinary research.

== Biography ==
Having gained her higher education entrance qualification (Matura) in 1979, Verena Winiwarter completed the College for Industrial Chemistry in Vienna with distinction in 1981. She subsequently worked as a technician at the Institute for Analytical Chemistry, Department of Environmental Analysis at the [[Vienna University of Technology]]. In 1986 she commenced her studies of Media and Communication Sciences and of History at Vienna University. She wrote her master’s thesis on the reception of antique agrarian literature during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. During the 1990s, she developed her first interdisciplinary projects on the topic of Austrian environmental history within the framework of the “sustainable development of Austrian cultural landscapes” programme launched by the Federal Ministry of Science and Research. From 1993 onwards Winiwarter collaborated on numerous research projects at the Interuniversity Institute for Interdisciplinary Research (now: Faculty for Interdisciplinary Studies) at the Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt. Working on the basis of the research programme for cultural landscape research, Winiwarter and three colleagues jointly submitted the first interdisciplinary doctoral thesis in this field at [[University of Vienna|Vienna University]], for which she received her doctorate in 1998 (title of the thesis: “Historical and Ecological Processes in a Cultural Landscape. Environmental History as Interdisciplinary Science”). She gained her university teaching credentials (venia legendi) for Human Ecology in 2003 with her post-doctoral thesis (title: “Historical Studies in Human Ecology”) at the Department of Anthropology at Vienna University. Since March 1, 2007, she has held the chair for [[Environmental History]] at the [[Faculty for Interdisciplinary Research and Continuing Education|Faculty for Interdisciplinary Studies]]. This is the only professorship of this kind in Austria. She has held the office of Dean of the Faculty since January 1, 2010.
Verena Winiwarter is married and has two children.

== Research and work ==
From 2007 onwards, Verena Winiwarter worked to establish a research focus on the [[environmental history]] of the [[Danube]] and expedited the expansion of the scientific foundation for an environmental history of Austria. She has managed several FWF projects ([[Austrian Science Fund]]), including the projects URBWATER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umweltgeschichte.uni-klu.ac.at/index,6536,URBWATER.html |title=Zentrum für Umweltgeschichte |publisher=Umweltgeschichte.uni-klu.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ALPINE SKIERS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umweltgeschichte.uni-klu.ac.at/index,4710,How+skiers%C2%B4sensations+shaped+Alpine+valleys.html |title=Zentrum für Umweltgeschichte |publisher=Umweltgeschichte.uni-klu.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014. In addition to her academic work, she has been able to introduce a broad audience to the topic of environmental history, and has established environmental history as part of school instruction.
Winiwarter’s team has been developing a literature database relating to Austrian environmental history (EHDA) since 2007, which can be accessed by the general public, both in Austria and internationally.
Winiwarter has been a member of the Commission for Interdisciplinary Ecological Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oeaw.ac.at/kioes/ |title=Commission for Interdisciplinary Ecological Studies (KIOES) |publisher=Oeaw.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] since October 2006. Since May 2010, she has been a corresponding member of the Section for the Humanities and Social Sciences of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and since December 2011 she has been a member of the Advisory Board of the Rachel Carson Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de/ |title=Rachel Carson Center |publisher=Carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de |date=2014-03-18 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she has held a seat on the scientific advisory board of the Estonian Centre for Environmental History (KAJAK) at the Institute of History of Tallinn University and of the Center for Environmental and Technological History in St. Petersburg since 2012.
She has contributed substantially to 9 books, has written a total of 136 articles and chapters in books, and has held 160 academic lectures, as well as 94 lectures for the wider public, in addition to numerous appearances as guest lecturer. Winiwarter is the editor-in-chief of GAIA and a member of the editorial team of several journals and series.

'''Victoria''' is the largest city and [[county seat]] of [[Victoria County, Texas]]. The population was 62,592 as of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. The three counties of the [[Victoria, Texas metropolitan area|Victoria Metropolitan Statistical Area]] had a population of 111,163 as of the 2000 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/metro/tables/2007/CBSA-EST2007-01.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2007 (CBSA-EST2007-01) |format=[[comma-separated values|CSV]] |work=2007 Population Estimates |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2008-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100709020951/http%3A//www%2Ecensus%2Egov/popest/metro/tables/2007/CBSA%2DEST2007%2D01%2Ecsv |archivedate=July 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria is located 30 miles inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. It is a regional hub for a seven-county area known as the "Golden Crescent", and serves a retail trade area of over 250,000 people. Victoria is known as "The Crossroads" because of its location within a two-hour drive of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], [[Houston]], [[San Antonio]], and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].

Victoria is named for [[General]] [[Guadalupe Victoria]], who became the first president of independent [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Texas Transportation Commission, ''Texas State Travel Guide, 2008'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Victoria is the cathedral city of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Victoria in Texas]].

==History==
{{See also|De León's Colony (Texas)}}The city of Guadalupe Victoria was founded in 1824 by Martín De León, a Mexican [[empresario]], in honor of [[Guadalupe Victoria]], the first President of the [[Mexico|Republic of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fde08|title=DE LEON, MARTIN|last=Roell|first=Craig H.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria was initially part of [[De León's Colony]], which had been founded that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ued01|title=DE LEON'S COLONY|last=Roell|first=Craig H.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1834, the town had a population of approximately 300.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdv01|title=VICTORIA, TX|last=Shook|first=Robert W.|date=2010-06-15|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Texas Revolution]], Guadalupe Victoria contributed soldiers and supplies to pro-revolutionary forces. However, after [[James Fannin]] was defeated by the Mexican army at the [[Battle of Coleto]], the town was occupied by Mexican forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] was defeated at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], the town's Mexican residents were driven out by Anglo settlers, who renamed it Victoria.

In 1840, a [[Comanche]] raid on nearby [[Linnville, Calhoun County, Texas|Linnville]] killed many residents of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/btl01|title=LINNVILLE RAID OF 1840|last=Roell|first=Craig H.|date=2010-06-15|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cholera]] outbreak occurred in 1846.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the mid-19th century, the city developed a large population of European immigrants, particularly Germans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  By the turn of the 20th century, Victoria was experiencing rapid population growth thanks to its position as a regional trade center. The city's advantageous proximity to Gulf Coast ports, the larger cities of [[San Antonio]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], and [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], and prosperous industries in agriculture and [[petrochemical]]s solidified its prominence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[University of Houston–Victoria]] was founded in 1971.

==Geography==
Victoria is located on the coastal plains of Texas about 50 miles from the Gulf of Mexico and 20 miles from the nearest bay waters.  It lies along and just to the east of the Guadalupe River.  The topography is mostly flat to slightly rolling with an average elevation of 95 feet. Most of the city is underlain by smectite-rich clay which is locally capped by silt or fine sand; the high shrink-swell potential associated with smectite creates major challenges to urban infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/HomePage.htm Web Soil Survey&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetation in better-drained areas consists primarily of short grasses with post oaks and other small timber and brush. Moist sites can grow tall forests dominated by elm and pecan.&lt;ref&gt;The Vegetation Types of Texas. Texas Parks and Wildlife, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Victoria is classified as [[humid subtropical]]. June through August is very hot and humid with high temperatures regularly exceeding 90&amp;nbsp;°F.  The record high temperature of 111&amp;nbsp;°F. was recorded in September 2000. Spring and autumn are generally mild to warm with lower humidity.  Winters are mild with occasional cold spells. The record low temperature was recorded in December 1989, when the temperature dropped to 9&amp;nbsp;°F.  Snow is very infrequent, usually occurring on average once every 11 years.  On December 24–25, 2004, Victoria recorded its [[2004 Christmas Eve United States winter storm|first White Christmas ever]] when 12.5&amp;nbsp;inches of snow fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.srh.noaa.gov/crp/?n=whitechristmas2004 |title= White Christmas in South Texas – 2004 |publisher= National Weather Service Forecast Office |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and has a secondary minimum in August, with intense heat and humidity prevailing. On average, the wettest months are May, June, September and October (the last two of these due to significant threat from tropical weather systems, including [[hurricanes]], which can produce torrential rainfalls some years).

Victoria has occasional severe weather, mostly from flooding.  Hurricanes have the potential to bring severe damage to the area.  [[Hurricane Claudette (2003)|Hurricane Claudette]] in July 2003 was the last hurricane to score a direct hit on the city. During this event, winds gusted to 83&amp;nbsp;mph at the Victoria Regional Airport and 90% of the city lost power.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  The most intense hurricane to affect Victoria remains [[Hurricane Carla]] in September 1961.

In May 2013, a rare tornado hit Victoria on a Saturday afternoon with tornado warnings everywhere from Corpus Christi to the southeast Houston/Sugarland Metro area. A short-lived tornado took a swipe at an open field northeast of Victoria, dodging all structures and causing no injuries but kicking up dirt and debris visible for miles. It was rare in the case that the area rarely gets tornados. Though when the Gulf Coast has a tornado it is usually associated 
with a hurricane. https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2013/may/26/ew_tornado_052613_210572/

==Transportation==
Known as the South Texas Crossroads, Victoria is located at the intersection of three major [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. highways]]:

* [[U.S. Route 59 in Texas|US Highway 59]] ([[Interstate 69 in Texas|I-69]] and [[I-69W]]) is a four-lane divided, interstate-quality highway extending southwest to Laredo and northeast to Houston, where it meets [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]] and [[Interstate 45]]. It is also known as the [[Lloyd M. Bentsen]] Highway. US 59 is planned to be included within the future [[Interstate 69 in Texas|Interstate 69]] from Victoria to Tenaha (once fully completed the mainline of Interstate 69 will travel from Brownsville, Texas to Port Huron, Michigan). US 59 is planned to be included within the future [[Interstate 69W]] from Victoria to Laredo.
* [[U.S. Route 77#Texas|US Highway 77]] (Future [[I-69E]]) travels north from Victoria to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, intersecting Interstate 10, [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]] and [[Interstate 37]]. US 77 travels south via a four-lane divided highway to the Rio Grande Valley. US 77 is planned to be included within the future [[Interstate 69E]] from Victoria to Brownsville.
* [[U.S. Route 87 in Texas|US Highway 87]] travels northwest connecting Victoria to San Antonio, providing access to Interstate 35.  US 87 also connects with Port Lavaca to the southeast.

Victoria is a regional transportation hub for the surrounding counties, with local access to major large and small freight carriers, [[Victoria Regional Airport]], railway terminals, the shallow draft [[Port of Victoria (Texas)|Port of Victoria]] and the deep water [[Port of Port Lavaca – Point Comfort]].

In 2002, Victoria Transit began operation of a citywide transportation system.  It currently offers bus service on four fixed routes consisting of 70 stops.

[[File:Memorial to Rev William Carrigan.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Rev William Carrigan near Ballyfoyle, County Kilkenny]]
Very Rev. '''William Carrigan'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DD|MRIA}} (29 August 1860 – 12 December 1924) was an Irish Roman Catholic priest and historian, who was appointed canon of the [[Diocese of Ossory]].

==Early life==
William Carrigan was the youngest of 13 children. He was born in 1860 in Ruthstown, Ballyfoyle, [[County Kilkenny]].&lt;ref name="ainm"&gt;{{cite news |title=CARRIGAN, William (1860–1924) |url=https://www.ainm.ie/Bio.aspx?ID=1825 |accessdate=6 June 2018 |work=The National Database of Irish Biographies |date=8 September 2015 |language=ga}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuscript volumes compiled by the Very Rev. William Cannon Carrigan contain an extensive collection of will abstracts. These are deposited in the Archives of St. Kieran's College, Kilkenny. Many of the wills in this collection relate to Catholic families and approximately 380 are from the Prerogative Court for the time period 1546 1857. For a printed index to the wills in this collection see The Irish Genealogist Volume 4, No. 3 (1970), pp. 221, 242. A manuscript copy of the index is in the Public Record Office, Dublin (Ref. M.4879) and a microfilm copy of the Carrigan collection is in the National Library of Ireland, Dublin (Ref N.480 P.902).&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his childhood education in the Ballyfoyle National School and then in Wellington Square in [[Kilkenny]] City. He then attended the ecclesiastical side of St Kieran's College. His education was continued at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth today a part of the larger [[NUI Maynooth]]. He was ordained by Francis Moran, [[Bishop of Ossory]], in 1884. His first posting was as curate in [[Ballyragget]]. Bishop Moran was a distinguished historian, having founded the Ossory Archaeological Society in 1872. He encouraged William's interests in history and he joined the Ossory Archaeological Society in 1884;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofos312osso/transactionsofos312osso_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; his first paper was printed in the last issue of the Ossory Archaeological Society in 1886.&lt;ref name="ainm"/&gt;

==Sources and origins of his works==
The 19th century saw a great interest in history. Kilkenny had already seen two major historical works published in 1884, [[John Hogan (historian)|John Hogan]]'s ''History of Kilkenny etc.'' and P. M. Egan's ''Illustrated Guide to the City and County of Kilkenny''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/digital-book-collection/digital-books-by-county/kilkenny/hogan-kilkenny/ |website=Ask About Ireland |title=Hogan: Kilkenny |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/digital-book-collection/digital-books-by-county/kilkenny/egan-kilkenny/ |website=Ask About Ireland |title=Egan: The illustrated guide to the city and county of Kilkenny |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clergy played an active role in these developments; the Rev. [[James Graves (antiquarian)|James Graves]], an Anglican cleric and antiquarian, was a frequent contributor to the Kilkenny Archaeological Society (renamed in 1890 to [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]]). Carrigan with his high interest in [[local history]] took these developments as reason to create his own writings. The Bishop of Ossory, Dr Brownrigg, encouraged Carrigan to begin a compilation of a history of Ossory. The Bishop would fund his travels and subscribe to the finished works.

Carrigan travelled around the diocese speaking at great length to older people, taking count of folklore traditions and [[oral history]]. We owe it to Carrigan that we still have these today. He also trudged through existing works and resolved conflicting accounts. All of his holidays were spent in the Public Records Office, Dublin, collecting information that related to Ossory.&lt;ref name="ainm"/&gt;

==''The History and Antiquities of Ossory''==
William Carrigan was 45 when ''The History and Antiquities of Ossory'' was completed. The finished work, divided into four volumes, took six years in the writing, between 1897 and 1903. The first volume deals with the overall history of the diocese from Pre-Christianity Celtic times to the Christianisation and through the Past Bishops and Clergy. The remaining volumes examine Ossory's parishes. It explains each parish's buildings, churches, castles, monuments etc. Townlands are also examined and the origins of their names explained as well as prominent families and tombstone inscriptions etc. Interwoven throughout his narrative in the first volume, is a history of the [[Kingdom of Ossory]] and the activity of its rulers, gentry and major clergy; complete with as many [[Irish annals|annalistic]] references and other primary sources as he could compile.&lt;ref name="ainm"/&gt;

Illustrations add to in the richness of his work; photography is used to its full extent. The firm chosen to print the work was Sealy, Bryer and Walker of Middle Abbey Street, Dublin. The firm had long experience of printing historical works. 738 individuals subscribed to the work. 840 copies were sold; the remaining 160 were lost in Dublin during the [[1916 Rising]]. The work was well received on its publication and although other diocesan histories exist, none come to par with it for its range and depth.&lt;ref name="ainm"/&gt;

==Later life==
Carrigan was created D.D. by the Pope in 1907. He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Durrow, County Laois]] in 1911. He continued to write and collect material; a further volume was planned but was never published. His unpublished works are preserved in the Diocesan Archives in [[St Kieran's College]]. Canon Carrigan died on 12 December 1924 as a result of contracting [[influenza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/20th-december-1924/18/our-own-correspondents-letter Details of death of Very Rev William Carrigan], thetablet.co.uk.

[[Image:Portrait of William Stearns Davis.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of William Stearns Davis.]]

'''William Stearns Davis''' (April 30, 1877 – February 15, 1930) was an American educator, historian, and author. He has been cited as one who “contributed to history as a scholarly discipline, . . . [but] was intrigued by the human side of history, which, at the time, was neglected by the discipline.”&lt;ref&gt;Krosch&lt;/ref&gt;  After first experimenting with short stories, he turned while still a college undergraduate to longer forms to relate, from an involved (fictional) character’s view, a number of critical turns of history.  This faculty for humanizing, even dramatizing, history characterized Davis’ later academic and professional writings as well, making them particularly suitable for secondary and higher education during the first half of the twentieth century in a field which, according to one editor, had “lost the freshness and robustness . . . the congeniality”&lt;ref&gt;Schmeller, ix&lt;/ref&gt; that should mark the study of history.  Both Davis’ fiction and non-fiction are found in public and academic libraries today.

==Life&lt;ref&gt;Kunitz; Krosch&lt;/ref&gt;==
Davis was born April 30, 1877 in the presidential mansion of [[Amherst College]], [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], where his mother's father had been president for the twenty-two years preceding his birth.  His father was [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister William Vail Wilson Davis; his mother Francis Stearns.  Due both to childhood illnesses and to family moves occasioned by his father's call to new congregations, Davis was largely educated at home until he entered [[Worcester Academy]] in 1895.  In 1897 he matriculated at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].  Fascinated by maps and by historical figures, he had begun writing stories for himself while still at home.  He now turned this experience and his desire to humanize history to writing historical novels, the first of which, ''A Friend of Caesar'', was published in the year he graduated as a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]].  He continued at Harvard, being the first first-year graduate student to receive the Harvard Thayer Graduate Scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'', iii, 369&lt;/ref&gt; and earning his A.M. in 1901 and his PhD in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'', iii, 369; xv (1903), 616&lt;/ref&gt;  During these same years he continued publishing historical fiction.

In 1904, Davis began his formal teaching career, beginning as a lecturer at [[Radcliffe College]] while finishing his doctorate.  He continued thereafter at [[Beloit College]] (instructor, 1906–07), [[Oberlin College]] (Assistant Professor of Medieval and Modern European History, 1907–1909), and finally at the [[University of Minnesota]] (Professor of History, 1909–1927).  “He was an excellent teacher with the ability to put life into his lectures.”&lt;ref name="Krosch, 240"&gt;Krosch, 240&lt;/ref&gt;  His steady output of non-fiction in both history and the historical background to contemporary world affairs began with his time at [[Minnesota]].  Professionally, he was a member of the [[American Historical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''AHR'', 690&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, he married Alice Williams Redfield of [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'', xv (1928–29), 616&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired from teaching in 1927, moving back to [[New England]] and taking up residence in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]], with the intention of devoting all of his time to writing.  However, he died of [[pneumonia]] following an operation at the age of 52 on February 15, 1930.

==Writings==

===Fiction===

Davis’ books are characterized by his desire to tell a story.  For his historical fiction, he chose subjects with dramatic flavor, such as the battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], the coming to power of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Leo the Isaurian|Leo the Isaurian’s]] defense of Constantinople, the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]], and the start of the [[American Revolution]].  Stylistically, they use narrative of the kind which Josephine Tey called “history-with-conversation”,&lt;ref&gt;Tey, 52&lt;/ref&gt; and his earliest novels have some of the attributes of scholarly publication, including meticulous (and copious) footnotes or appendices.  Indeed, a reviewer of a later fictional work noted that previously “Mr. Davis has erred in overabundance of detail.  Knowing much is sometimes more troublesome than knowing little, and Mr. Davis's knowledge has in times past seemed too large for his story.  In ''Falaise,'' however, this fault is to a most felicitous degree overcome . . . .”&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, 196&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''American National Biography'' noted that his fictional works “were not classics, . . . but they were accurate and maintained an interesting story line.”&lt;ref name="Krosch, 240" /&gt;  He himself would become deeply involved in such writings, to the point of depression when one was finished.

===Non-fiction===

In a similar manner, the elements of narrative and drama are part of his non-fiction, much of which was written for teaching purposes.  His 1910 work on wealth and money in first-century Rome begins with an almost journalistic daily-weekly narrative of bank failures and trading house suspensions leading to a financial panic in 33 AD&lt;ref&gt;Davis, ''Influence,'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; (which must have read all too familiarly to those who had just weathered the [[Panic of 1907|1907 crash]]).  The opening of ''The Roots of the War'', perhaps his most contemporaneously widely read nonfiction book, portrays [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Moltke the Elder|Moltke]], and [[Albrecht von Roon|Roon]] at dinner in 1870, planning what would become the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, ''Roots,'' 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his last works, ''Europe Since Waterloo'' (and all the revisions based upon it) begins with a narrative picture of [[Napoleon]] on the deck of the British man-o'-war transporting him to his final exile in St. Helena.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, ''Europe,'' 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Forty years later, Kurt Schmeller, producing the latest revision of that work, would say that he “sought to retain the powerful and dramatic narrative of earlier editions”,&lt;ref&gt;Schmeller, v&lt;/ref&gt; and Theodore H. Von Laue’s foreword to the same edition would cite Davis’ “forceful, lively, and down-to-earth style” as a motive to retain the core of a work then moving towards a half-century of use.&lt;ref&gt;Schmeller, viii&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis’ strong anti-German sentiment colored much of his later non-fiction writing, particularly in his articles and letters to various periodicals.  He was a forceful advocate of military preparedness in the years leading up to World War I, for which he was duly criticized in the widely pacifistic feeling of the times (see for example the 1916 exchange of letters in ''The Survey'').&lt;ref&gt;''Survey'', 440, 497, 592–3&lt;/ref&gt;  During World War I, Davis and many other academic historians desired to support the war but hesitated between a professionally ethical approach to history and a firm belief in [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson’s]] expressed ideals in advocating American intervention in the War.  Davis chose to participate in the work of the government-sponsored [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI).  Davis in particular provided historical background and context to the Committee's pamphlet on Wilson’s war message to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;CPI, 4; Blakey, 39&lt;/ref&gt;  For this work, in the years following the War, he and the other participants were criticized by some contemporaries belonging to the [[Historical revisionism|"revisionist" historical school]], such as [[Harry Elmer Barnes]].  Succeeding next-generation scholars in the same tradition were equally critical.  A particularly outspoken critic, C. Hartley Gratton, said of Davis' CPI efforts and of his 1918 ''The Roots of the War'' that there was "free use of gossip, and the 'revelations' of the Creel Bureau are accepted as definitive truth".&lt;ref&gt;Gratton, 428&lt;/ref&gt;   Davis himself would write in 1926 of the earlier work that “very little of [that] hastily prepared material has endured under the cold scrutiny demanded by added information and years of retrospect.”.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, ''Europe,'' vii&lt;/ref&gt;  In view of Davis' retirement and early death, what long-term effect such criticisms might have had upon him is unknowable.  Blakey sums up the revisionists' efforts by saying that, however they changed the practice of historical writing, "their impact on the subsequent lives and careers of the embattled historians was slight to the point of being negligible,"&lt;ref&gt;Blakey, 139&lt;/ref&gt; and this could apply fairly to Davis.

===Historical approach===

Throughout his writing career, both of fiction and non-fiction, Davis’ "angle" to history, as he himself put it in his preface to ''Europe Since Waterloo'', included:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“a belief in a just form of ''nationalism'', and that a devoted loyalty to native land is entirely reconcilable with an ardent love for wide humanity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“an intense belief in ''democracy'', . . . and that the modern age is bound to resume the old, old battle against the vicious assumption that some select group of men . . . is competent to decree the destinies of an entire people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Finally, . . . a matured belief that only as ''the spirit of Christianity'' penetrates the hearts of men will human brotherhood and wide-spread, enduring happiness be achieved . . . .  If the so-called Christian nations and rulers have all too often failed unworthily, their failure has been because they knew not the essence of Christianity, however eagerly they have usurped the name.”&lt;ref&gt;Davis, ''Europe'', viii; quoted italics original&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stylistically, Davis never gave up on writing ''stories'' as a medium to convey his love for history as he saw it, and his intense conviction that the knowledge of history should matter to his contemporaries.  He had a faculty for describing critical scenes, such as the expulsion of the tribunes in ''A Friend of Caesar'' or Luther before the [[Diet of Worms]] in ''The Friar of Wittenberg''.&lt;ref&gt;Nation, 237&lt;/ref&gt;  In his day, he was known for his “vivid, almost melodramatic prose style”.&lt;ref&gt;Blakey, 39&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Twentieth Century Authors'' would credit him with having welded “fact and fiction without loss of narrative intensity or historical plausibility.”&lt;ref&gt;Kunitz, 356&lt;/ref&gt;
