      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3035">An '''absentee business owner''' is one who does not personally manage the business but owns it or does not live in the community in which the business operates. Studies show that money spent locally circulates back into the community three times as much when it is not spent with an absentee-owned business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starherald.com/articles/2010/01/30/news/local_news/doc4b626d45e3a47145488804.txt&lt;/ref&gt; [[Local currency]] has been implemented in some communities as a countermeasure to this effect. Neighborhood investment, in which members of the community are given opportunities to become partial owners of new developments, is another method.&lt;ref&gt;http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060409/news_mz1b9neighbo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], studies found that more than a third of the profits generated from tourism were exported to absentee business owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Estimating the economic impacts of tourism|author=Wagner, John E.|publisher=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=24|issue=3|year=1997|pages=592–608}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vietnam, the economic expansion of the 1990s was associated with a rise in absentee business owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=University of Illinois College of Law Law and Economics Working Papers|date=February 2007|paper=|title=Do Norms Still Matter?

An '''asset''' in [[economic theory]] is a [[durable good]] which can only be partially consumed (like a [[portable music player]]) or input as a [[factor of production]] (like a [[concrete mixer|cement mixer]]) which can only be partially used up in production.  The necessary quality for an asset is that value remains after the period of analysis so it can be used as a [[store of value]].  As such, financial instruments like corporate bonds and common stocks are assets because they store value for the next period.  If the good or factor is used up before the next period, there would be nothing upon which to place a value.

&lt;!-- attempt to guess at meaning of incomprehensible original--&gt;As a result of this definition, assets only have positive [[futures market|futures]] prices.  This is analogous to the distinction between consumer durables and non-durables.  Durables last more than one year.  A classic durable is an automobile. A classic non-durable is an apple, which is eaten and lasts less than one year. Assets are that category of output which economic theory places prices upon.  In a simple [[Walras]]ian equilibrium model, there is but a single period and all items have prices.  In a multi-period equilibrium model, while all items have prices in the current period.  Only assets can survive into the next period and thus only assets can store value and as a result, only assets have a price today for delivery tomorrow.  Items which depreciate 100% by tomorrow have no price for delivery tomorrow because by tomorrow it ceases to exist.

The subfield of [[asset pricing]] (or valuation) is the financial evaluation of the value of such assets; the primary method used by today's [[financial analyst]]s is the [[discounted cash flow]] method.  With this method, an asset's future [[cash flow]]s are either assumed to be known with certainty (as in a [[treasury bond]] which is risk free) or estimated.  These future cash flows are discounting used [[present value]]s.

The [[Flow of Funds]] tables from the [[Federal Reserve System]] provide data about assets, which are tangible assets and financial assets, and liabilities. The difference, assets minus liabilities, is net worth.

{{Business administration}}

The outcome of '''business operations''' is the ''harvesting'' of value from assets owned by a business. Assets can be either ''[[tangible property|physical]]'' or ''[[intangible asset|intangible]]''. An example of value derived from a physical asset, like a building, is rent. An example of value derived from an [[intangible asset]], like an idea, is a royalty. The effort involved in "harvesting" this value is what constitutes business operations cycles.

== Overview ==
Business operations encompass three fundamental management imperatives that collectively aim to maximize value harvested from business assets (this has often been referred to as "sweating the assets"):

# Generate recurring [[income]]
# Increase the value of the business assets
# Secure the income and value of the business

The three imperatives are [[interdependent]]. The following basic tenets illustrate this interdependency:
* ''The more recurring income an asset generates, the more valuable it becomes''. For example, the products that sell at the highest volumes and prices are usually considered to be the most valuable products in a business's ''product portfolio''.
* ''The more valuable a product becomes the more recurring income it generates''. For example, a luxury car can be leased out at a higher rate than a normal car.
* ''The intrinsic value and income-generating potential of an asset cannot be realized without a way to secure it''. For example, petroleum deposits are worthless unless processes and equipment are developed and employed to extract, refine, and distribute it ''profitably''.

The [[business model]] of a business describes the means by which the three management imperatives are achieved. In this sense, business operations is the execution of the business model.

== Business operations topics ==

=== Generating recurring income ===
This is the most straightforward and well-understood management imperative of business operations. The primary goal of this imperative is to implement a ''sustained'' delivery of [[goods and services]] to the business's [[customers]] at a cost that is less than the funds acquired in exchange for said goods and also self employee services—in short, making a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].

The funds directly acquired by the business in exchange for the goods and services it delivers is the business's [[revenue]].

The cost of developing, producing, and delivering these goods and services is the business's [[expenses]].

A business whose revenues are sufficiently greater than its expenses makes profit or income. Such a business is [[profitable]]. As such, generating [[recurring revenue|recurring "revenue"]] is not the focus of operations management; what counts is management of the relationship between the cost of goods sold and the revenue derived from their sale. Efficient processes that reduce costs even while prices remain the same expand the gap between revenue and expenses and derive higher profitability.

Types of recurring income-
* Long term [[sales contract]]s - monthly to yearly based contracts for a service and/or product; example -  mobile phone contracts/plans.
* Multiple revenue streams - different sources of business income that support each other; example - sell printers and toners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.se-adv.com/SEA_feature1_03_2012.htm |title=How to recreate recurring revenue streams |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005023824/http://www.se-adv.com/SEA_feature1_03_2012.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increasing the value of the business ===
The more profitable a business is, the more valuable it is. A business's profitability is measured on the basis of how much income it generates for the:
* amount of assets its business operations employ — its [[business return]].
* amount of revenue it realizes — its [[business margin]].

====Methods of increasing value====
;[[economic growth|Growth]] strategies
* Expand market: offer product or service to a wider section of an existing market or to a new [[demographic]], [[psychographic]] or geographic market.
* [[Brand development|Develop brand]]: a recognised, respected and developed brand is highly valuable. Develop through research, design and marketing of companies name, logo and tagline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-develop-a-brand.html|title = How to develop a brand|date = |accessdate = |website = For Dummies|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Management systems
* Show growth potential: create a business that has potential to be efficiently expanded. Example: developing an efficient business system and operating manuals allows the business to potentially be [[franchising|franchised]] or licensed.
* Maintain intangible assets: Maintaining intangible assets can protect elements that add value to a business - [[patenting]], [[copyrighting]] or [[trademarking]] anything believed to be an intangible asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://learn.nab.com.au/how-to-increase-the-value-of-your-business/|title = NAB- Increase value of your business|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Protect and maintain physical assets: protecting physical assets will also help protect the overall value, this can be done through: regular maintenance and insuring viable physical assets.

=== Securing the income and value of the business ===
* Desirability or demand for its goods and services
* Ability of its customers to pay for its goods and services
* Uniqueness and competitiveness of its business model
* Control exerted over the quality and efficiency of production activities
* Public regard for the business as a member of the community

A business that can harvest a significant amount of value from its assets but cannot ''demonstrate'' an ability to sustain this effort cannot be considered a viable business.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14548">In [[finance]], '''cornering the market''' consists of obtaining sufficient control of a particular [[stock]], [[commodity]], or other [[asset]] in an attempt to [[market manipulation|manipulate]] the market price. One definition of cornering a market is "having the greatest [[market share]] in a particular industry without having a [[monopoly]]."

Companies that have cornered their markets have usually done so in an attempt to gain greater leeway in their decisions; for example, they may desire to charge higher prices for their products without fears of losing too much business. The cornerer hopes to gain control of enough of the [[supply and demand|supply]] of the commodity to be able to set the price for it.

This can be attempted through several mechanisms. The most direct strategy is to simply buy up a large percentage of the available commodity offered for sale in some [[spot market]] and [[Hoarding (economics)|hoard]] it. With the advent of [[futures trading]], a cornerer may buy a large number of [[futures contract]]s on a commodity and then sell them at a profit after inflating the price.

Although there have been many attempts to corner markets by massive purchases in everything from [[tin]] to [[cattle]], to date very few of these attempts have ever succeeded; instead, most of these attempted corners have tended to break themselves spontaneously. Indeed, as long ago as 1923, [[Edwin Lefèvre]] wrote, "very few of the great corners were profitable to the engineers of them."&lt;ref&gt;Lefèvre, Edwin (1923), ''[[Reminiscences of a Stock Operator]]'', chapter 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  A cornerer can become vulnerable due to the size of the [[Position (finance)|position]], especially if the attempt becomes widely known. If the rest of the market senses weakness, it may resist any attempt to artificially drive the market any further by actively taking opposing positions. If the price starts to move against the cornerer, any attempt by the cornerer to sell would likely cause the price to drop substantially. In such a situation, many other parties could profit from the cornerer's need to unwind the position.

Cornering is a condition of market when most of the assets are held by a particular group of individuals in a market. It is an undesirable activity and may affect interest of other investors.

==Historical examples==

=== Thales of Miletus (c. 6th century BC) ===
According to [[Aristotle]] in ''[[The Politics]]'' (Book I Section 1259a),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |translator=H. Rackham |title=Politics |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Pol.+1.1259a&amp;redirect=true |accessdate=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales of Miletus]] once cornered the market in olive-oil presses:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thales, so the story goes, because of his poverty was taunted with the uselessness of philosophy; but from his knowledge of astronomy he had observed while it was still winter that there was going to be a large crop of olives, so he raised a small sum of money and paid round deposits for the whole of the olive-presses in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a low rent as nobody was running him up; and when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for a number of presses at the same time, and by letting them out on what terms he liked he realized a large sum of money, so proving that it is easy for philosophers to be rich if they choose.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century: Classic examples by Edwin Lefèvre===
Journalist Edwin Lefèvre lists several examples of corners from the mid-19th century. He distinguishes corners as the result of manipulations from corners as the result of competitive buying.

====Cornelius Vanderbilt and the Harlem Railroad====
One of the few cornerers whose rationale was published and justified, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] started accumulating shares of the [[Harlem Railroad]] in 1862 because he anticipated its strategic value. He took control of the Harlem Railroad and later explained that he wanted to show that he could take this railroad, which was generally considered worthless, and make it valuable. The corner of June 25, 1863 can be seen as just an episode in a strategic investment that served the public well.

====James Fisk, Jay Gould and the Black Friday (1869)====
The 1869 [[Black Friday (1869)|Black Friday]] financial panic in the United States was caused by the efforts of [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] to corner the gold market on the [[New York Gold Exchange]]. When the government gold hit the market, the premium plummeted within minutes and many investors were ruined. Fisk and Gould escaped significant financial harm.

====Lefèvre thoughts on corners of the old days====
In chapter 19 of his book, Edwin Lefèvre tries to summarize the rationale for the corners of the 19th century.
{{quote|A wise old broker told me that all the big operators of the 60s and 70s had one ambition, and that was to work a corner. In many cases this was the offspring of vanity; in others, of the desire for revenge. [...] It was more than the prospective money profit that prompted the engineers of corners to do their damnedest. It was the vanity complex asserting itself among cold-bloodest operators.}}

===20th century: The Northern Pacific Railway===
The corner of The [[Northern Pacific Railway]] on May 9, 1901, is a well documented case of competitive buying, resulting in a panic. The 2009 Annotated Edition of ''[[Reminiscences of a Stock Operator]]'' contains Lefèvre's original account in chapter 3 as well as modern annotations explaining the actual locations and personalities on the page margins.

===1920s: The Stutz Motor Company===
Called "a forerunner of the Livermore and Cutten operations of a few years later" by historian [[Robert Sobel]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} the March 1920 corner of The [[Stutz Motor Company]] is an example of a manipulated corner ruining everyone involved, especially its originator Allan Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1969/08/23/1969_08_23_074_TNY_CARDS_000296736 The New Yorker: A Corner in Stutz, 23 August 1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s: The onion market===
In the late 1950s, [[United States]] [[onion]] [[farmer]]s alleged that Sam Seigel and [[Vincent Kosuga]], [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] traders, were attempting to corner the market on onions. Their complaints resulted in the passage of the [[Onion Futures Act]], which banned trading in onion futures in the United States and remains in effect {{As of|2018|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Romer|last=Kieth|title=The Great Onion Corner And The Futures Market|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/10/22/450769853/the-great-onion-corner-and-the-futures-market|newspaper=[[NPR]]|location= |date=22 October 2015|access-date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s: The Hunt brothers and the silver market===
Brothers [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]] and [[William Herbert Hunt]] attempted to corner the world [[silver]] markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at one stage holding the rights to more than half of the world's deliverable silver.&lt;REF NAME="TEXAS"&gt;{{Cite magazine

Pallache worked with his father in trade and as an agent of Morocco.&lt;ref name=Woordenboek /&gt;  When his father traveled and stayed in Morocco, David served as his deputy in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Moroccan&gt;

In 1621, he helped negotiate a peace treaty for Morocco with France.&lt;ref name=Moroccan /&gt;

From 1630 onwards, he took over from his brother Abraham as unofficial Dutch consul in Safi, Morocco.&lt;ref name=Moroccan /&gt;

He also served as agent to France, where in 1634 when [[Louis XIII of France]] demanded his father's extradition, after which David succeeded him in 1637.&lt;ref name=Woordenboek /&gt;

In 1634, apparently to clear some debts, he became involved commercially with Michael Spinoza (father of philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]).&lt;ref name=Moroccan /&gt;

==Personal and death==

The scholarly biography ''A Man of Three Worlds: Samuel Pallache, a Moroccan Jew in Catholic and Protestant Europe'' did not find intermarriage between the Pallache brothers or sons and members of the Portuguese Sephardic community in the Netherlands.  In fact, it documents the contrary, e.g., that sons Isaac and Joshua did not go make such marriages.  "It seems significant that no male member of the Pallache family ever married a woman from the Portuguese community...  it is surely significant that neither Samuel nor any of his heirs were ever to marry into the great trading families of 'the Portuguese nation'."&lt;ref name=three&gt;

{{Companies law}}

In [[corporate law]], the '''directors register''' is a list of the [[board of directors|directors]] elected by the [[shareholders]], generally stored in the company's [[minute book]].  By law, companies are required to keep this list up to date to remove those directors who are deceased or resign, and to add those who have been elected by the shareholders. However, the register must also list any person who had been a director indefinitely.  The record must indicate the dates a director started and stopped holding office. As directors carry certain personal legal obligations to a corporation (for example, being responsible for any money held in [[Trust law|trust]] for another person, e.g. [[sales taxes]] not remitted to a government), those seeking recourse against directors are allowed to rely on the directors register as proof that a director held office on any particular day.

In many jurisdictions, corporations are required to keep the list of directors up to date with the corporate affairs office where the corpororation was incorporated. This is so that both government agencies and interested third parties may be aware of the name and address of directors (for example, in order to serve a [[statement of claim]] on the corporation).

[[Publicly traded corporations]] are usually required to notify the appropriate securities and exchange commission about any change to their directors register.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4148">'''Efraim Ilin''' (1912&amp;ndash;2011) was an Israeli tycoon and security expert. He is known for founding [[Kaiser-Frazer#Kaiser in Israel|Kaiser in Israel]].

==Early life==

Ilin was born in [[Kharkov]], [[Russian Empire]] (today Kharkiv, [[Ukraine]]). He grew up with [[Zionist]] upbringing and spoke [[Hebrew]] from the age of 6. In 1925 his family emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]], settling in [[Ness Ziona]]. Ilin studied at the [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]]. In 1934 he married his wife Ziporah.

==Security career==

In 1938 Ilin was drafted by [[Avraham Stern]] to volunteer in the [[Irgun]]. He worked with Stern and [[David Raziel]] who was one of its founding members. In 1948, together with [[Ehud Avriel]], Ilin, who was then living in [[Milan]], negotiated a deal with [[Czechoslovakia]] to supply arms for the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palyam.org/OniyotRekhesh/RexBorea/RexAndBoreaPdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 Ilin also negotiated an arms equipment deal with [[Levi Eshkol]] and the Yugoslavians on behalf of the [[Mossad]].&lt;ref&gt;Uri Bialer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lS7ti_loZMkC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=efraim+ilin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AGqcwmHFKM&amp;sig=NxzkOcib2ZS1KSqYlU91SoXMrqs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NQU0VN63Fsj3yQTJ9oHwBA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=efraim%20ilin&amp;f=false Between East and West: Israel's Foreign Policy Orientation 1948-1956]. Cambridge University Press, 1990. Page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial career==

In 1945 Ilin helped Max Cukier and Avram Goldstein to contract to buy Egyptian cotton to be spun in Italy for re-export to Palestine and became their junior partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldstein-goren.org/AboutUs.html The Goldstein Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102132346/http://goldstein-goren.org/AboutUs.html |date=2014-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1948, after the founding of the State of Israel, the Henry Ford Motor Company sought to invest in Israel and facilitate the large number of vehicles it would need for the military and government. After threats of boycotts from the Arab nations, Ford backed down.

While the government was searching for alternatives, Lord [[Marcus Sieff]] of London, put Ilin in contact with [[Hickman Price]] of [[Kaiser-Frazer]]. Kaiser had recently built an automobile plant in the Netherlands, and were planning to build an additional one in Greece. Ilin met Price and the two agreed to begin a $2.5 million project. Kaiser-Frazer was prepared to invest half a million dollars and it would be Ilin's responsibility to invest the other two million dollars. In 1950, Ilin, who was unsure if the investment would be successful, traveled to Brooklyn, N.Y. to meet Rabbi [[Menachem M. Schneerson]] for advice on the matter. Schneerson urged Ilin to provide the two million needed to bring the deal to fruition, telling Ilin that the new car company would boost the Israeli economy and provide jobs for Israeli citizens, Holocaust survivors and new immigrants. Schneerson told Ilin the deal would be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 478.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaiser was opened in Israel in 1951.

The factory in Israel built Kaiser-Frazer products, along with Mack trucks, under license. By 1956, Kaiser-Fraizer was responsible for 28% of Israeli exports. By the end of the 1950s, the operation was known as Kaiser-Ilin, named after Ilin.

In 1959, Kaiser-Ilin reached an agreement to assemble six-cylinder Studebaker Larks in Haifa, to help potential buyers bypass stiff Israeli duties on imported vehicles. Earlier that year, the Kaiser-Frazer plant at Haifa laid off 400 workers and suspended operations for two weeks because of a lack of parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/1959/12/02/archive/kaiser-frazer-plant-in-israel-suspends-operations-for-two-weeks#ixzz3Ex2QNHge

{{European patent law}}
The '''European Patent Convention''' ('''EPC'''), also known as the '''Convention on the Grant of European Patents''' of 5 October 1973, is a multilateral [[treaty]] instituting the [[European Patent Organisation]] and providing an autonomous legal system according to which '''European patents''' are granted.  The term ''European patent'' is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However, a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents,&lt;ref name="SingerArt2andScourfield"&gt;The view that a European patent issues as independent national patents in each designated Contracting state is very convenient from a practical point of view. Some however consider this view as incorrect:
:"''The view that, after grant, a European patent breaks up into a bundle of national patents in designated Contracting States may appear plausible, but it is incorrect both in law and systematically''", Singer/Stauder, ''The European Patent Convention, A Commentary'', Munich, 2003, under Article 2.
Singer/Stauder's view seems in turn rather theoretical in view of decisions ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'' and ''GAT v LUK'' of the [[European Court of Justice]] (see also "Enforcement and validity" section), which reinforced the independent character of a European patent in each Contracting State. As Tom Scourfield wrote in an article commenting on these two decisions:
:"''(...) a European patent is no more than a bundle of national patents pursuant to a single application. Until a true community patent becomes a reality it seems likely that true community enforcement will continue to elude patent owners.''" Tom Scourfield, ''Jurisdiction and Patents: ECJ rules on forum for validity and cross-border patent enforcement'', The CIPA Journal, August 2006, Volume 35 No. 8, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited [[opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposition procedure]], which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and [[limitation and revocation procedures]], which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.

The EPC provides a legal framework for the granting of European patents,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|2|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; via a single, harmonised procedure before the [[European Patent Office]]. A single [[patent application]], in one language,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be filed at the European Patent Office in [[Munich]],&lt;ref name="Art75-1-a"&gt;{{EPC Article|75|1|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its branch in [[The Hague]],&lt;ref name="Art75-1-a"/&gt;{{refn|The Hague branch of the EPO is actually located in [[Rijswijk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/g880007ep1.html Enlarged Board of Appeal decision G 7/88 (Administrative Agreement) of 16.11.1990], Summary of Facts and Submissions, V.(3)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} at its sub-office in [[Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj1989/p189_270.pdf Decision of the President of the European Patent Office dated 10 May 1989 on the setting up of a Filing Office in the Berlin sub-office of the European Patent Office]'', OJ 1989, 218&lt;/ref&gt; or at a national patent office of a Contracting State, if the national law of the State so permits.&lt;ref name="Art75-1-b"&gt;{{EPC Article|75|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and rationale==
Before 1978, two important problems when seeking to obtain patent protection in Europe in a number of countries were first the need to file a separate patent application in each country, with a subsequent distinct grant procedure in each country, and secondly the need to translate the text of the application into a number of different languages. Different languages are indeed utilised across the European countries and there is substantial expense in preparing translations into each of those languages.  While the European Patent Convention does not totally overcome the need for translations (since a translation may be required after grant to validate a patent in a given EPC Contracting State), it does centralise the prosecution in one language and defers the cost of translations until the time of grant.

== History ==

In September 1949, French Senator [[Henri Longchambon]] proposed to the [[Council of Europe]] the creation of a European Patent Office. His proposal, known as the "Longchambon plan", marked the beginning of the work on a European patent law aimed at a "European patent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bossung |first=Otto |title=The Return of European Patent Law in the European Union |journal=IIC |volume=27 |issue=3/1996 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |url=http://www.suepo.org/public/background/bossung_en.htm |quote=Work on a European patent law aimed at a "European patent" had begun in Strasbourg in 1949 with the Longchambon plan. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304232011/http://www.suepo.org/public/background/bossung_en.htm |archivedate=4 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His plan was however not found to be practicable by the Council's Committee of Experts in patent matters. The meetings of the Committee nevertheless led to two Conventions, one on the [[European Convention relating to the Formalities required for Patent Applications|formalities required for patent applications]] (1953) and one on the [[European Convention on the International Classification of Patents for Invention|international classification of patent]] (1954).&lt;ref name="Tookey"&gt;G. W. Tookey, ''Patents in the European Field'' in Council of Europe, Council of Europe staff, ''European Yearbook 1969'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1971, pages 76–97, {{ISBN|90-247-1218-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's Committee then carried on its work on substantive patent law, resulting in the signature of the [[Strasbourg Patent Convention]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Tookey"/&gt;

In 1973, the ''Munich Diplomatic Conference for the setting up of a European System for the Grant of Patents'' took place and the Convention was then signed in Munich (the Convention is sometimes known as the "Munich Convention"). The signature of the Convention was the accomplishment of a decade-long discussion during which [[Kurt Haertel]], considered by many as the father of the European Patent Organisation, and [[François Savignon]] played a decisive role.

The Convention entered into force on 7 October 1977 for the following first countries: [[Belgium]], Germany (then [[West Germany]]), France, [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]] and United Kingdom, and on 1 May 1978 for [[Sweden]]. However, the first patent applications were filed on 1 June 1978 (date fixed by the [[European Patent Organisation#Administrative Council|Administrative Council]] which held its first meeting on 19 October 1977).  Subsequently, other countries have joined the EPC.

The EPC is separate from the European Union (EU), and its membership is different; [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Turkey]], [[Monaco]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[San Marino]], [[Albania]] and [[Serbia]] are members of the EPO but are not members of the EU. The Convention is, as of January 2015, in force in 38 countries.&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/epo/member-states.html|title=Member states of the European Patent Organisation|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia became the 38th state on 1 October 2010.&lt;ref name="serbia"/&gt;

A diplomatic conference was held in November 2000 in Munich to revise the Convention, amongst other things to integrate in the EPC new developments in [[international law]] and to add a level of judicial review of the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Boards of Appeal]] decisions. The revised text, informally called the [[EPC 2000]], entered into force on 13 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Patent Office|Official Journal of the EPO]], 2/2006, [http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj006/02_06/02_1386.pdf ''Notice from the European Patent Office dated 27 January 2006 concerning deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification of the EPC Revision Act'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperation agreements with non-contracting states: extension and validation agreements===
Throughout the history of the EPC, some non-contracting States have concluded cooperation agreements with the European Patent Organisation, known as extension or validation agreements. These states then became "extension states" or "validation states", which means that European patents granted by the EPO may be extended to those countries through the payment of additional fees and completion of certain formalities. Such cooperation agreements are concluded by the President of the European Patent Office on behalf of the European Patent Organisation pursuant to {{EPC Article|33|4}}, are not based on a "direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/natlaw/en/a/index.htm|title=National Law relating to EPC|publisher=EPO|quote=The extension system largely corresponds to the EPC system operating in the EPC contracting states, except that it is based not on direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC. It is therefore subject to the national extension rules of the country concerned.|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exist to assist with the establishment of national property rights in these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|vii|2|1}}: "Extension agreements and ordinances", "Legal nature"&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case in EPO contracting states, the rights conferred to European patents validated/extended to these states are the same as national patents in those states. However, the extension of a European patent or patent application to these states is "not subject to the jurisdiction of the [EPO] boards of appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|vii|2|2}}: "No jurisdiction of the boards of appeal"&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2015, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]]&lt;ref name="ME"/&gt; have extension agreements with the EPO so that, in effect, these states can be designated in a European patent application. Several other "extension states" have since become states parties to the EPC. Furthermore, so-called "validation agreements" with Morocco, Moldova, Tunisia, and Cambodia are also in effect since 1 March 2015, 1 November 2015, 1 December 2017, and 1 March 2018, respectively.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20150119.html|title=Morocco recognises European patents as national patents|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=19 January 2015|work=European Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20150302.html|title=Validation agreement with Morocco enters into force|date=1 March 2015|publisher=EPO|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moldova-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20151008.html|title=European patents to cover Moldova|date=8 October 2015|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tunisia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2017/20171004.html|title=Brevets européens en Tunisie : L’accord de validation entre l’OEB et la Tunisie entrera en vigueur le 1er décembre|trans-title=European patents in Tunisia: The validation agreement between the EPO and Tunisia will enter into force on December 1|date=3 October 2017|publisher=European Patent Office|language=French|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/foundation/validation-states.html|title=Validation states|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="validation-agreement-KH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/official-journal/information-epo/archive/20180209.html|title=Validation of European patents in Cambodia (KH) with effect from 1 March 2018|date=9 February 2018|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal nature and content ==
{{EPC requirements}}
The European Patent Convention is "a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the [[Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], signed in Paris on 20 March 1883 and last revised on 14 July 1967, and a regional patent treaty within the meaning of Article 45, paragraph 1, of the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] of 19 June 1970."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/apre.html|title=Preamble [of the European Patent Convention]|publisher=EPO|accessdate=25 January 2015}} See also [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/g980002ep1.pdf Enlarged Board of Appeal opinion G2/98], "Reasons for the Opinion", point 3, first sentence: "The EPC constitutes, according to its preamble, a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the Paris Convention".&lt;/ref&gt; The European Patent Convention currently does not lead to the grant of centrally enforceable patents in all 38 countries, although the [[European Union patent]] would allow for unitary effect: centrally enforceability throughout 24 of the 27 countries of the European Union.

The content of the Convention includes several texts in addition to the main 178 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/ma1.html|title=The European Patent Convention|publisher=EPO|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional texts, which are integral parts of the Convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|164|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* the "Implementing Regulations to the Convention on the Grant of European patents", commonly known as the "Implementing Regulations". The function of the Implementing Regulations is "to determine in more detail how the Articles should be applied".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iii|h|6}}: "Implementing Regulations"&lt;/ref&gt; In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the Implementing Regulations, the provisions of the EPC prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|164|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the "Protocol on Jurisdiction and the recognition of decisions in respect of the right to the grant of a European patent", commonly known as the "Protocol on Recognition". This protocol deals with the right to the grant of a European patent but exclusively applies to European patent applications.
* the "Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Patent Organisation", commonly known as the "Protocol on Privileges and Immunities";
* the "Protocol on the Centralisation of the European Patent System and on its Introduction", commonly known as the "Protocol on Centralisation";
* the "Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the Convention";
* the "Protocol on the Staff Complement of the European Patent Office at The Hague", commonly known as the "Protocol on Staff Complement".

== Substantive patent law ==
One of the most important articles of the Convention, {{EPC Article|52|1}}, entitled  "''Patentable [[invention]]s''", states:
{{quotation|European patents shall be granted for any inventions, in all fields of technology, providing that they are [[Novelty under the European Patent Convention|new]], involve an [[inventive step under the European Patent Convention|inventive step]], and are susceptible of [[industrial applicability|industrial application]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{EPC Article|52|1}}. The state of the art is further defined in Articles 54(2)-(5), and a limited grace period is specified in {{EPC Article|55}}, but this is only relevant in cases of breach of confidence or disclosure of the invention in a recognised international exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article constitutes the "fundamental provision of the EPC which governs the patentability of inventions".&lt;ref name="T 154/04-r6"&gt; [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t040154ex1.htm Decision T 154/04] of 15 November 2006, Reasons 6, to be published at the [[Official Journal of the European Patent Office]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the EPC provides further indications on what is patentable. There are exclusions under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC and exclusions under Article 53 EPC.

First, [[discovery (observation)|discoveries]], [[theory|scientific theories]], mathematical methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; aesthetic creations,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, programs for computers&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|c}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presentations of information&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|d}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not regarded as inventions&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are excluded from patentability only to the extent that the invention relates to those areas ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is "a negative, non-exhaustive list of what should not be regarded as an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC."&lt;ref name="T 154/04-r6"/&gt; ''(For further information, see also: [[Software patents under the European Patent Convention|Software patents under the EPC]]).''

The second set of exclusions, or exceptions, include
* inventions contrary to "''ordre public''" or morality,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* plant or animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, and [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] methods practised on the human or animal body,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|c}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have been excluded for "socio-ethical considerations and considerations of [[public health]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/cdd5fb0c3153e9c3c12576cb00563d2d/$FILE/G1_07_en.pdf Decision G 1/07 of February 15, 2010], Reasons 3.3.6. See also [[G 1/07]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unified prosecution phase ==
{{main|Grant procedure before the European Patent Office}}

The Convention also includes provisions setting out filing requirements of European applications, the procedure up to grant, the opposition procedure and other aspects relating to the prosecution of patent applications under the Convention.

European patent applications may be filed in any language, but they are prosecuted only in one of the three official languages of the EPO – English, French and German. If an application is filed in a language other than an official language, a translation must be filed into one of the three official languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|14|2}}; {{EPO Guidelines|a|vii|1|1}}: "Admissible languages; time limit for filing the translation of the application"; "European patent applications can be filed in any language."&lt;/ref&gt; within two months from the date of filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|6|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official language of filing (or of the translation) is adopted as the "language of proceedings" and is used by the EPO for communications.

European patent applications are [[patent prosecution|prosecuted]] in a similar fashion to most patent systems – the invention is searched and published, and subsequently examined for compliance with the requirements of the EPC.

During the prosecution phase, a European patent is a single regional proceeding, and "the grant of a European patent may be requested for one or more of the Contracting States."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An applicant for a European patent designates those Contracting States in which protection for the [[invention]] is desired,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|79}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update after|2010|11}} &lt;!-- To be converted to EPC 2000 --&gt; and the designations need to be "confirmed" later during the procedure through the payment of designation fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|79|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once granted by the EPO,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European patent comes into existence effectively as a group of national patents in each of the designated Contracting States.

==Opposition==
{{main|Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office}}

There are only two types of centrally executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the [[limitation and revocation procedures before the European Patent Office|limitation and revocation procedures]]. The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] process, subject to appeal, which can lead to maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute).  National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.

== Grant, effect and need for translations ==

In contrast to the unified, regional character of a European patent application, the granted European patent does not comprise, in effect, any such unitary character, except for the opposition procedure.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the opposition procedure and even after it has ended, particular acts can still be performed before the European Patent Office, such as requesting a rectification of an incorrect designation of inventor under {{EPC Rule|19|1}}. {{Update after|2010|11}} &lt;!-- To be converted to EPC 2000 --&gt; "Rectification may [indeed] be requested after the proceedings before the EPO are terminated" (Guid. A III 5.6).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, one European patent in one Contracting State&lt;ref&gt;There is no consistent usage of a particular expression to refer to "the European patent in a particular designated Contracting State for which it is granted". The article uses the expression "a European patent in a Contracting State" which is considered to be the most consistent with the authoritative text, i.e. the EPC.&lt;/ref&gt; is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition procedure.

A European patent confers rights on its proprietor, in each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted, from the date of publication of the mention of its grant in the [[European Patent Bulletin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|1}}: EP patent has same effect as national patent in "each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted"; {{EPC Article|97|2) and (4}}: decision to grant "for the designated Contracting States" is made by the examining division.&lt;/ref&gt; That is also the date of publication of the B1 document, i.e. the European patent specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the European patent is granted and confers rights in all its designated Contracting States at the date of mention of the grant, whether or not a prescribed translation is filed with a national patent office later on (though the right may later be deemed never to have existed in any particular State if a translation is not subsequently filed in time, as described below).

A translation of a granted European patent must be filed in some EPC Contracting States to avoid loss of right. Namely, in the Contracting States which have "prescribe[d] that if the text, in which the European Patent Office intends to grant a European patent (...) is not drawn up in one of its official languages, the applicant for or proprietor of the patent shall supply to its central industrial property office a translation of this text in one of its official languages at his option or, where that State has prescribed the use of one specific official language, in that language".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European patent is ''[[void ab initio]]'' in a designated Contracting State where the required translation (if required) is not filed within the prescribed time limit after grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other Contracting States, no translation needs to be filed, for example in Ireland if the European patent is in English. In those Contracting States where the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]] is in force the requirement to file a translation of the European patent has been entirely or partially waived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Veronese|Watchorn|2011|}}, Chapter XI.4&lt;/ref&gt; If a translation is required, a fee covering the publication of said translation may be due as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|2}}; [http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/national/html/en/iv/index.htm National law, Chapter IV, Filing of translations of the patent specification under Article 65 EPC] (regarding implementation in EPC Contracting States)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enforcement and validity ==
{{main|Enforcement of European patents}}
Almost all attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, except for the opposition procedure, limitation procedure, and revocation procedure as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{EPC Article|2|2}}, {{EPC Article|64|1) and(3}}, {{EPC Article|66}}, {{EPC Article|74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, almost all post-grant proceedings – including [[renewal (patent)|renewal]], revocation proceedings (when initiated by somebody else than the proprietor), and [[patent infringement|infringement enforcement]] are determined under national law.

EPO Boards of Appeal decisions are not precedential at all upon national courts, which have exclusive jurisdiction on validity and infringement after a European patent has been granted (except during the 9-month opposition period, which can only relate to validity). However, national courts will tend to take note, and may find 'persuasive', decisions of the EPO Boards, though they can disagree with them.

===Infringement===
[[patent infringement|Infringement]] is remitted almost entirely to national law and to national courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of its very few substantive interventions into national law, the EPC requires that national courts must consider the "direct product of a patented process" to be an infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "extent of the protection" conferred by a European patent is determined primarily by reference to the claims of the European patent (rather than by the disclosure of the specification and [[patent drawing|drawing]]s, as in some older patent systems), though the description and drawings are to be used as interpretive aids in determining the meaning of the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|69|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC" provides further guidance, that claims are to be construed using a "fair" middle position, neither "strict, literal" nor as mere guidelines to considering the description and drawings, though of course even the protocol is subject to national interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Southco Inc v Dzus'', [1992] R.P.C. 299 CA; ''Improver Corp. v Remington Products Inc'' [1990] FSR 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The authentic text of a European patent application and of a European patent are the documents in the language of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SingerArt2Precedence"&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|Stauder|2003}}, under Article 2, section "EPC provisions on European patents that take precedence over national law"&lt;/ref&gt;

All other substantive rights attached to a European patent in a Contracting State, such as what acts constitute infringement (indirect and divided infringement, infringement by equivalents, extraterritorial infringement, infringement outside the term of the patent with economic effect during the term of the patent, infringement of product claims by processes for making or using, exports, assembly of parts into an infringing whole, etc.), the effect of prosecution history on interpretation of the claims, remedies for infringement or bad faith enforcement (injunction, damages, attorney fees, other civil penalties for wilful infringement, etc.), equitable defences, coexistence of an EP national daughter and a national patent for identical subject matter, ownership and assignment, extensions to patent term for regulatory approval, etc., are expressly remitted to national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|2|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all EP jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the [[European Court of Justice]].  In two cases in July 2006 interpreting Articles 6.1 and 16.4 of the [[Brussels Regime|Brussels Convention]], the European Court of Justice held that European patents are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was "unavoidable" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-4/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-4/03, ''Gesellschaft für Antriebstechnik  v Lamellen und Kupplungsbau Beteiligungs KG'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]; [http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-539/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-539/03, ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity===
Validity is also remitted largely to national law and national courts. {{EPC Article|138|1}} limits the application of national law to only the following grounds of invalidity, and specifies that the standards for each ground are those of national law:

* if the subject-matter of the European patent is not patentable within the terms of Articles 52 to 57 EPC (see "Substantive patent law" section above);
* if the [[disclosure of the invention under the European Patent Convention|disclosure does not permit the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art]];&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* if [[amendments under the European Patent Convention|amendments have been made]] such that the subject-matter extends beyond the content of the application as filed;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|c}}, {{EPC Article|123|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* if the claims have been broadened post-grant, e.g. in opposition proceedings;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|d}}, {{EPC Article|123|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an improper proprietor&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|e}}, {{EPC Article|60}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in some jurisdictions, only the person pretending to be entitled to the European patent can raise this specific ground, so that the resulting nullity of the patent may be relative to some persons only&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Laurent Teyssedre, [http://europeanpatentcaselaw.blogspot.com/2012/03/la-nullite-tiree-du-motif-de-lart-1381.html ''La nullité tirée du motif de l'Art 138(1) e) est relative''], Le blog du droit européen des brevets, 5 March 2012. Consulted on 10 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;—.

A national court may partially invalidate a European patent in a Contracting State, e.g., by revoking only some claims, or by permitting amendment to the claims, the description or the drawings, as allowed by national law.

A European patent is also non-unitary in that it may be revoked in one Contracting State while maintained in another. However, a national court in one Contracting State may not revoke a European patent in another Contracting State.

== Term (duration) of a European patent ==

The EPC requires all jurisdictions to give a European patent a [[Term of patent|term]] of 20 years from the filing date,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the filing date being the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the date of filing of an international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty|PCT]] designating the EPO. The filing date is not necessarily the [[priority right|priority date]], which can be up to one year earlier.  The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member states this is by means of a [[supplementary protection certificate]].

== Relation with the Patent Cooperation Treaty ==

A European patent application may result from the filing of an international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), i.e. the filing of a PCT application, and then the entry into "European regional phase",&lt;ref&gt;See {{PCT Article|11|3}}, which provides a [[legal fiction]] according to which an international application, i.e. a PCT application, has the effect of a regular European patent application as of the international filing date under certain conditions (see for instance [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/j090018ex1.html Decision J 18/09 of the Legal Board of Appeal 3.1.01 of 1 September 2010], Reasons 7 and 8); and {{EPC Article|150|2), (first sentence}}: "International applications filed under the PCT may be the subject of proceedings before the European Patent Office."&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the transition from the international to the European procedural stages. The European patent application is therefore said to be a "Euro-PCT application" and the EPO is said to act as a designated or elected Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|e|viii|2}}: "EPO as designated or elected Office".&lt;/ref&gt; In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the PCT, the provisions of the PCT and its Regulations prevail over those of the EPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|150|2), (third sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve EPC Contracting States, namely [[Belgium]], [[Cyprus]], France, [[Greece]], Ireland, Italy, [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Slovenia]] have "closed their national route".&lt;ref&gt;For Malta, source: "European Patent Office web site, [http://www.epo.org/patents/law/legal-texts/InformationEPO/archiveinfo/02012007.html ''Accession to the PCT by Malta (MT)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220506/http://www.epo.org/patents/law/legal-texts/InformationEPO/archiveinfo/02012007.html |date=26 September 2007 }}, Information from the European Patent Office, January 2, 2007; for Latvia, source: [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2007/pct_news_2007_4.pdf ''Latvia: Closing of the National Route via the PCT''], [[PCT Newsletter]] of April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it is no longer possible to obtain a national patent protection through the international (PCT) phase without entering into the regional European phase and obtaining a European patent. Lithuania closed its "national route" most recently, on 4 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2012/pct_news_2012_02.pdf ''Lithuania: Closing of the National Route via the PCT''], [[PCT Newsletter]] No. 02/2012, p. 1.; {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2014/pct_news_2014_05.pdf|title=Lithuania: Reminder re the Closing of the National Route via the PCT|work=PCT Newsletter No. 05/2014|publisher=WIPO|page=3|accessdate=11 May 2014}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2014/article_0005.html|title=Lithuania: Reminder re the Closing of the National Route via the PCT|date=July–August 2014|work=PCT Newsletter No. 07-08/2014|accessdate=13 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142535/http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2014/article_0005.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2812">'''Hans Imhoff''' (March 12, 1922 – December 21, 2007) was a [[Germany|German]] chocolate producer and founder of the [[Imhoff-Schokoladenmuseum]] (Imhoff Chocolate Museum) in [[Cologne]], Germany.&lt;ref name="Imhoff-Schokoladenmuseum"&gt;[http://www.schokoladenmuseum.de/index_e.html Official Website of the Imhoff-Schokoladenmuseum Cologne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122072806/http://www.schokoladenmuseum.de/index_e.html |date=2009-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imhoff was born in Cologne to Franz and Charotte Imhoff (née Gallé). After leaving Elementary School he then joined a Trade School, where he trained in Commercial and Vocational Studies. Imhoff founded a chocolate and sugar factory after World War II where he produced non-branded chocolates, which became very successful. In 1969 he took over the ''Hildebrand'' chocolate company in Berlin – Germany's oldest chocolate manufacturer - who held the chocolate brand "[[Scho-Ka-Kola]]". In 1972 Imhoff took over the failing [[Stollwerck]] chocolate company, and managed to convert it into a successful business. He built up a European Chocolate group through acquiring other brands such as [[Sprengel]] and [[Sarotti]]. Imhoff retired from the company in 2002.&lt;ref name="Imhoff-Schokoladenmuseum" /&gt;

In 1993 Imhoff opened the ''Imhoff-Schokoladenmuseum'' (Imhoff Chocoilate Museum) in Cologne which creates around 650,000 visitors per year.&lt;ref name="Imhoff-Schokoladenmuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Das Schokoladenmuseum – from geschichte.nrw.de"&gt;[http://www.geschichte.nrw.de/artikel.php?artikel%5Bid%5D=385&amp;lkz=de Das Schokoladenmuseum – from geschichte.nrw.de (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the city of Cologne gave Imhoff an [[honorary citizenship]].

Imhoff was married to Clare Gerburg Schmitt, with whom he had four children. He died on 21 December 2007 (aged 85) of an infection caused by lung inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,525113,00.html „Schokoladenfabrikant Imhoff gestorben“], [[Spiegel Online]], 22. December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to a [[Kyoto]] family that ran a long-standing [[wagashi]] store, Inabata attended the Kyoto-fu Shihan Gakkō (now the [[Kyoto University of Education]]) and in 1877 earned a scholarship to attend the [[La Martiniere Lyon|La Martinière technical school in Lyon]].&lt;ref name=Shunkato&gt;{{cite web|title=Inabata Katsutarō to Kyōto sangyō no hatten|url=http://www.joho-kyoto.or.jp/~retail/akinai/senjin/inahata-1.html|work=Kyō no shunkatō|publisher=Kyōto Kouri Shien Sentā|accessdate=14 December 2012|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228005854/http://www.joho-kyoto.or.jp/~retail/akinai/senjin/inahata-1.html|archivedate=28 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Victorian&gt;{{cite web|last=McKernan|first=Luke|title=Inabata Katsutaro|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/inabata|work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his classmates there was [[Auguste Lumière]], who was later one of the inventors of the [[cinematographe]].&lt;ref name=Victorian /&gt;&lt;ref name=CMN&gt;{{cite web|last=Toki|first=Akihiro|title=A History of Early Cinema in Kyoto, Japan (1896-1912): Cinematographe and Inabata Katsutaro|url=http://www.cmn.hs.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/NO1/SUBJECT1/INAEN.HTM|work=CineMagiziNet|accessdate=14 December 2012|author2=Mizuguchi Kaoru}}&lt;/ref&gt; After studying weaving and dying technology for eight years, Inabata returned to Japan in 1885 and, after teaching others about what he learned, started his own company, Inabata Senryōten (later [[Inabata &amp; Co., Ltd.]]), in 1890.&lt;ref name=kotobank /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shunkato /&gt; He later moved the company to [[Osaka]] and focused his business on dying military uniforms.&lt;ref name=kotobank2&gt;{{cite web|title=Inabata Katsutarō|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E7%A8%B2%E7%95%91%E5%8B%9D%E5%A4%AA%E9%83%8E|work=Nihon jinmei daijiten+Plus|publisher=Kōdansha|accessdate=16 December 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving success, Inabata later served as president of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OCCI) from 1922 to 1934,&lt;ref name=kotobank /&gt; and became a member of the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]].&lt;ref name=kotobank2 /&gt; A bronze statue of him still stands in front of the OCCI.&lt;ref name=OCCI&gt;{{cite web|title=Ōsaka Shōkō Kaigisho biru-mae no dōzō|url=http://www.osaka.cci.or.jp/wakasj/statue/|publisher=Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry|accessdate=14 December 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inabata was also instrumental in the founding of the Institut Franco-Japon du Kansai (currently l’Institut français du Japon – Kansai) in 1926.&lt;ref name=Francais&gt;{{cite web|title=Institut français du Japon - Kansai - UN PARCOURS DE 75 ANS|url=http://ifjk.jp/fr/about/history|publisher=Institut français du Japon - Kansai|accessdate=14 December 2012|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622064403/http://ifjk.jp/fr/about/history|archivedate=22 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film business==
When Inabata returned to France in 1896, he met Lumière again and learned about the motion picture apparatus that he and his brother Louis had developed.

'''James David Mooney''' (18 February 1884 – 21 September 1957) was an engineer and corporate executive at General Motors who played a role in international affairs in the 1930s and early 1940s. His career was disrupted when he was  accused of Nazi sympathies in 1940.

== Biography ==
===Early years===
Born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Mooney attended the [[Case School of Applied Science]] in Cleveland, and in 1908 received a B.S. in Mining and Metallurgy.

After graduating he went on gold mining expeditions in Mexico and California. From 1910 to 1917 Mooney worked at [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]], [[B. F. Goodrich]] and the [[Hyatt Roller Bearing Company]], which later became part of [[General Motors]]. He steadily rose in the management ranks.

In 1917 he enrolled in the army, and served in France as a captain with the 309th Ammunition Regiment, 159th Field Artillery.{{sfn|The James D. Mooney Papers}}

===General Motors executive===
After the war Mooney was appointed President and General Manager of [[Delco Remy]], a General Motors subsidiary. In 1922 Mooney was made President of General Motors Overseas, responsible for operations around the world.

He traveled widely, visiting his division's factories in many different countries. Mooney was an early leader in managerial theory, recording his theories and real-life experiences in the widely read ''Onward Industry'' (1931), reissued in a revised edition as ''The Principles of Organization''. He succeeded in applying American approaches to a great range of conditions in other countries.{{sfn|The James D. Mooney Papers}}

===Informal diplomacy===
Mooney met leading government officials and other members of the elite in the countries he visited, discussing local and global economic issues.
He was awarded the [[Order of the German Eagle|German Order of Merit of the Eagle]] in 1938. In May 1939 he met Nazi officials in Germany and discussed various issues concerning GM's Adam-[[Opel]] facility.

He arranged for a meeting in London between Helmuth Wohlthat, who was working for [[Hermann Göring]] on a four-year plan for the German economy, and ambassador [[Joseph Kennedy]]. The purpose was to discuss possible loans in exchange for more open trade conditions. In December 1939 and January 1940 he met with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and obtained authority for informal discussions with the Germans to better understand their goals. In March 1940 Mooney met first with [[Adolf Hitler]] and then with Göring. He presented Roosevelt's views to both men, and recorded their replies.{{sfn|The James D. Mooney Papers}}

The German lawyer and businessman [[Gerhardt Alois Westrick]] visited the United States between March and August 1940.{{sfn|Bloomenkranz|2012|p=36}} 
According to [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]] in his book ''Trading with the Enemy'', [[Sosthenes Behn]] of ITT arranged the trip and persuaded [[Torkild Rieber]], CEO of [[Texaco]], to look after Westrick's local needs.{{sfn|Doerries|Weinberg|2013|p=92}} 
Westrick represented many American companies in Germany including [[ITT Corporation|ITT]], [[Ford]], General Motors, [[Standard Oil]], the [[Texas Company]], [[Sterling Products]], and the [[Davis Oil Company]].{{sfn|Higham|1983|p=95}}
On 26 June 1940, one day after the surrender of France, Rieber sponsored a celebratory dinner for Westrick at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York]]. Attendees included [[Sosthenes Behn]] of ITT, James D. Mooney, [[Edsel Ford]] of the [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[Philip Dakin Wagoner]] of [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood]].{{sfn|Bloomenkranz|2012|p=37-38}}

Hostile accounts of the dinner were published by the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''.{{sfn|Stevenson|2000|p=108}}
Early in August 1940 the recently founded ''[[PM Magazine]]'' published a series of articles that attacked Mooney for his contacts with the Nazis.
The magazine accused him of pro-German views and criticized a speech he had made, later printed as an article in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', entitled "War or Peace in America?"{{sfn|The James D. Mooney Papers}}

===Later career===
In 1940 Mooney resigned from his position as President of General Motors Overseas to head a small team of directors charged with gearing up GM for wartime production. Mooney worked in the Production Engineering Section of the Bureau of Aeronautics.{{sfn|The James D. Mooney Papers}}

[[George S. Messersmith]], [[United States Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Cuba]], wrote a report on 4 March 1941 that criticized Mooney's negative views of England. He considered that Mooney was "dangerous ... for the [[Edward VIII|Duke]] and [[Duchess of Windsor]] to be associated with."{{sfn|Higham|1988|pp=311–312}} The Windsors visited Mooney in [[Detroit]] in November 1941, the month before the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].{{sfn|Higham|1988|p=328}}

Later Mooney joined the staff of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. Mooney returned to GM after the war, but in 1946 left to head up [[Willys-Overland Motors]] as Chairman and President.{{sfn|The James D. Mooney Papers}} James David Mooney died in [[Tucson, Arizona]] on 21 September 1957 at the age of 73.{{sfn|Hayward|2011}}

A lawyer, Banny served as Minister of Defense for Côte d'Ivoire from its independence in 1960 to 1963.&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt; In 1963, he was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death on charges of participating in President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]'s ''"complot du chat noir"'' (black cat conspiracy).&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt; Meanwhile, his office was transferred to [[Kouadio M'Bahia Blé]] whose ministership lasted more than 17 years.&lt;ref name="lcweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7023.html |title=Ivory Coast: Constitutional, Legal, and Administrative Structure|work=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]|accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was discontent in the army, as the generals stirred following his arrest and Houphouët-Boigny had to intervene personally to sedate the army.&lt;ref&gt;Le Vine, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Banny, who personally knew Houphouët-Boigny from childhood, was pardoned and released in 1967.&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt; He asked Banny to be the mayor of [[Yamoussoukro]], though Houphouët-Boigny's successor, [[Henri Konan Bédié]], appointed Banny as Resident Minister of the capital.&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt; The Resident Minister is a member of the Council of Elders of the PDCI, which includes roughly a hundred elders.&lt;ref name="jeuneafrique"/&gt;

He was appointed as President of the Cayman Islands Football Association in 1991.&lt;ref name="ca-profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeff Webb proile|url=http://www.caymanactive.com/cifa-news/69-cifaprofiles/2476-jeffrey-webb-president|publisher=Cayman Active|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=6 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714033352/http://www.caymanactive.com/cifa-news/69-cifaprofiles/2476-jeffrey-webb-president|archivedate=14 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb was a Business Development Manager at [[Western Union]] agent belonging to Fidelity Bank (Cayman) Limited, a subsidiary of Fidelity Bank &amp; Trust International Limited, which is involved in retail banking, investment banking, corporate finance and asset management. Outside of banking, Webb co-owns a franchise of Burrell's bakery chain "Captain's Bakery" in the Cayman Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Rudolph|title=Captain's Bakery opens in Cayman|url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20020209/business/business1.html|publisher=[[Jamaica Gleaner]]|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=9 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football===

In 1994, he was co-opted as a member of the [[Caribbean Football Union]] Executive Committee, and member of FIFA’s Protocol Committee in 1995. Prior to his appointment to CIFA, Webb served as President of the local football club Strikers FC.

Within FIFA’s governing body, in 2002 Webb became Deputy Chairman of the FIFA Internal Audit Committee and subsequently Chairman in 2011. He is a former member of FIFA’s Transparency and Compliance Committee and, most recently, was appointed as member of FIFA’s Strategic, Finance, Organizing World Cup and Emergency Committees.

Webb also took part of FIFA’s delegations to the World Cup including [[France (1998)]], [[U.S. Women’s World Cup (1999)]], [[Korea/Japan (2002)]], [[Germany (2006)]], and [[South Africa (2010)]].

During Webb's time as CIFA President, it was reported that British players were being offered up to £70k to represent Cayman Islands at international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caymans launch World Cup trawl|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/feb/29/newsstory.sport4|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=24 March 2016|date=29 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was wrongly thought that anyone with a British passport was eligible for the Cayman Islands national team. In March 2000, FIFA intervened and prevented several English players playing for the Cayman Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=BILL MARWICK|author2=ANGUS WRIGHT|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18729577.html|title=FIFA's darkness falls on Brannan's island in the sun.|work=The Scotsman|publisher=ECM Publishers, Inc. 2000.|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CONCACAF===
Webb was unanimously elected to lead the Confederation of North, Central America and the Caribbean Football Association (CONCACAF) on May 23, 2012, in Budapest, Hungary. He became the fourth President in the Confederation’s history, and the youngest leader of any regional association within FIFA to reach this position.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

As President of CONCACAF, Webb also became FIFA Vice President and an official member of the governing body’s Executive Committee. Moreover, on March 2013 Webb was appointed by FIFA President [[Joseph Blatter]] as Chairman of the FIFA anti-discrimination task force, which will oversee all matters related to discrimination within global football.

At the time of his appointment, in 2012, Webb was President of the Cayman Islands Football Association (CIFA).

Webb appointed a new Miami-based General Secretary, [[Enrique Sanz de Santamaría]], enabling the CONCACAF head office to relocate to [[Miami]].&lt;ref name="concacaf-2012-7-13"&gt;{{cite web|title=CONCACAF appoints Enrique Sanz as General Secretary |url=http://www.concacaf.com/page/ConfederationDetail/0,,12813~2848973,00.html |publisher=CONCACAF.com |accessdate=14 July 2012 |date=13 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720005131/http://www.concacaf.com/page/ConfederationDetail/0%2C%2C12813~2848973%2C00.html |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption==
{{Main|2015 FIFA corruption case}}
In September 2014 Webb was one of several FIFA officials to call for the publication of the [[Garcia Report]] into allegations of corruption surrounding Russia and Qatar's bids for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]s.&lt;ref name=GuardSep14&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/24/michael-garcia-fifa-investigation-public-world-cup|title=Fifa prosecutor Michael Garcia calls for World Cup report to be made public|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 24, 2014|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wikinews|FIFA ethics committee recommends lifetime ban of former FIFA vice-president}}
On 27 May 2015, Webb was arrested for corruption charges. The indictment, which named fourteen other individuals related to FIFA, included racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. In addition to senior soccer officials, the indictment also named sports-marketing executives from the United States and South America who are accused of paying more than $150 million in bribes and kickbacks in exchange for media deals associated with major soccer tournaments. Other soccer officials charged are [[Eduardo Li]], [[Eugenio Figueredo]], [[Jack_Warner_(football_executive)|Jack Warner]], [[Julio Rocha Lopez]], [[Costas Takkas]], [[Rafael Esquivel]] and [[Nicolás Leoz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/sports/soccer/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-blatter-isnt-among-them.html |title= FIFA Inquiry Yields Indictments; U.S. Officials Vow to Pursue More |first1= Matt |last1= Apuzzo |first2= Stephanie |last2= Clifford |first3= William K. |last3= Rashbaummay |date= 27 May 2015 |accessdate= 27 May 2015 |work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges were also made against the sports-marketing executives [[Alejandro Burzaco]], [[Aaron Davidson]], [[Hugo Jinkis]] and Mariano Jinkis. Authorities also charged José Margulies as an intermediary who facilitated illegal payments.&lt;ref name="FIFA Inquiry Yields Indictments" /&gt; In November 2015 Webb pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit more than US$6.7 million.

Following his a suspension, he was replaced by [[Alfredo Hawit]] at CONCACAF and Bruce Blake at CIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawit becomes CONCACAF acting president after Webb charged|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/28/hawit-becomes-concacaf-acting-president-after-webb/|publisher=Washington Times|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caymanfootball.com/cifa-statement/ |title=CIFA Statement |publisher=Cayman Islands Football Association |date=3 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604071754/http://caymanfootball.com/cifa-statement/ |archivedate= 4 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Luther King Jr. Day''' (officially '''Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/federal-holidays/#url=2013 |title=Federal Holidays |publisher=Opm.gov |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Federal holidays in the United States|American federal holiday]] marking the birthday of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] It is observed on the third Monday of January each year, which is around King's birthday, January 15. The holiday is similar to holidays set under the [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]]. The earliest Monday for this holiday is January 15 and the latest is January 21.

King was the chief spokesperson for [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] activism in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law. The campaign for a federal holiday in King's honor began soon after [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|his assassination]] in 1968. President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the holiday into law in 1983, and it was first observed three years later. At first, some states resisted observing the holiday as such, giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays. It was officially observed in all 50 states for the first time in 2000.

[[File:Reagan signs Martin Luther King bill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|[[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Coretta Scott King]] at the Martin Luther King Jr. Day signing ceremony.]]
The idea of Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday was promoted by [[trade union|labor unions]] in contract negotiations.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones |first=William P. |date=January 30, 2006 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/working-class-hero?page=full |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnLFgB58?url=http://www.thenation.com/article/working-class-hero?page=full |title=Working-Class Hero |work=[[The Nation]] |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After King's death, [[United States Representative|U.S. Representative]] [[John Conyers]] (a Democrat from [[Michigan]]) and [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Edward Brooke]] (a Republican from [[Massachusetts]]) introduced a bill in Congress to make King's birthday a national holiday. The bill first came to a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979. However, it fell five votes short of the number needed for passage.&lt;ref name="Wolfen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfensberger |first=Don |date=January 14, 2008 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/events/docs/King%20Holiday-essay-drw.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnLjow8L?url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/events/docs/King%20Holiday-essay-drw.pdf |title=The Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday: The Long Struggle in Congress, An Introductory Essay |publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the main arguments mentioned by opponents were that a paid holiday for federal employees would be too expensive, and that a holiday to honor a private citizen would be contrary to longstanding tradition (King had never held public office).&lt;ref name="Wolfen" /&gt; Only two other figures have national holidays in the U.S. honoring them: [[George Washington]] and [[Christopher Columbus]].&lt;!-- Please do not change this sentence. The *national* holiday is Washington's Birthday, not President's Day (which is the name of a state holiday in many states). --&gt;

Soon after, the [[Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site|King Center]] turned to support from the corporate community and the general public. The success of this strategy was cemented when musician [[Stevie Wonder]] released the single "[[Happy Birthday (Stevie Wonder song)|Happy Birthday]]" to popularize the campaign in 1980 and hosted the Rally for Peace Press Conference in 1981. Six million signatures were collected for a petition to Congress to pass the law, termed by a 2006 article in ''[[The Nation]]'' as "the largest petition in favor of an issue in U.S. history."&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt;

Senators [[Jesse Helms]] and [[John Porter East]] (both [[North Carolina]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s) led opposition to the holiday and questioned whether King was important enough to receive such an honor. Helms criticized King's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and accused him of espousing "action-oriented [[Marxism]]".&lt;ref name="dewar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewar |first=Helen |date=October 4, 1983 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/articles/helms_stalls_kings_day.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnjqzpMi?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/articles/helms_stalls_kings_day.html |title=Helms Stalls King's Day in Senate |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A01 |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helms led a filibuster against the bill and on October 3, 1983, submitted a 300-page document to the Senate alleging that King had associations with [[Communism|communists]]. New York Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] declared the document a "packet of filth", threw it on the Senate floor and stomped on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Romero|first=Frances|title=A Brief History of Martin Luther King Jr. Day|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1872501,00.html|newspaper=Time|date=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtwright|first=David T.|title=No Right Turn: Conservative Politics in a Liberal America|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-04677-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J5Vb52f6rOIC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=moynihan+%22packet+of+filth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=moynihan%20%22packet%20of%20filth%22&amp;f=false|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] originally opposed the holiday, citing cost concerns. When asked to comment on Helms' accusations that King was a communist, the president said "We'll know in thirty-five years, won't we?", in reference to the eventual release of [[FBI]] surveillance tapes that had previously been [[record sealing|sealed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Younge|first1=Gary|title=The Misremembering of 'I Have a Dream'|journal=The Nation|date=September 2–9, 2013|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/175764/misremembering-i-have-dream#|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on November 2, 1983, Reagan signed a bill, proposed by [[Katie Hall (politician)|Representative Katie Hall]] of Indiana, to create a federal holiday honoring King.&lt;ref name="reagan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolley |first=John T. |author2=Gerhard Peters |date=November 2, 1983 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40708 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnN6qLAO?url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40708 |title=Ronald Reagan: Remarks on Signing the Bill Making the Birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., a National Holiday |publisher=[[The American Presidency Project]] |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|98|399|98|1475|1983|11|02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill had passed the House of Representatives by a count of 338 to 90, a veto-proof margin.&lt;ref name="dewar"/&gt; The holiday was observed for the first time on January 20, 1986.

The bill also established the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission to oversee observance of the holiday, and [[Coretta Scott King]], King's wife, was made a member of this commission for life by [[George H. W. Bush|President George H. W. Bush]] in May 1989.&lt;ref name="bush"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolley |first=John T. |author2=Gerhard Peters |date=May 17, 1989 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17040 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnNNh4n5?url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17040 |title=George Bush: Remarks on Signing the Martin Luther King Jr., Federal Holiday Commission Extension Act |publisher=[[The American Presidency Project]] |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|101|30|103|60|1989|05|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State-level passage==
Although the federal holiday honoring King was signed into law in 1983 and took effect three years later, not every U.S. state chose to observe the holiday at the state level until 1991, when the [[New Hampshire]] legislature created "Civil Rights Day" and abolished "[[Fast Day]]".&lt;ref name="nhgov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbreth |first=Donna |year=1997 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/fast.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnmmR8yQ?url=http://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/fast.html |title=Rise and Fall of Fast Day |publisher=New Hampshire State Library |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Utah]] became the last state to have a holiday named after King when "Human Rights Day" was officially changed to "Martin Luther King Jr. Day."&lt;ref name="newcrisis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Petrie|first=Phil W.|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/3783538/mlk-holiday-branches-work-make-work|title=The MLK holiday: Branches work to make it work|date=May–June 2000|work=[[The New Crisis]]|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Arizona [[List of Governors of Arizona|Governor]] [[Bruce Babbitt]], a Democrat, created a paid state MLK holiday in Arizona by executive order just before he left office, but in 1987, his Republican successor [[Evan Mecham]], citing an attorney general's opinion that Babbitt's order was illegal, reversed Babbitt's decision days after taking office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ye Hee Lee|first=Michelle|title=Recalling Arizona's struggle for MLK holiday|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/20120112martin-luther-king-holiday-dilemma.html#ixzz2IYEyGRdg|accessdate=January 20, 2013|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Mecham proclaimed the third Sunday in January to be "Martin Luther King Jr./Civil Rights Day" in Arizona, albeit as an unpaid holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Day in United States|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/civil-rights-day|website=timeanddate.com|publisher=Time and Date AS|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Arizona voters were given the opportunity to vote on giving state employees a paid MLK holiday. That same year, the [[National Football League]] threatened to move [[Super Bowl XXVII]], which was planned for Arizona in 1993, if the MLK holiday was voted down.&lt;ref name="TucsonSentinel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/101611_az_mlk_dedication/arizonans-recall-fight-state-mlk-holiday |title=tucsonsentinel.com |publisher=tucsonsentinel.com |accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November election, the voters were offered two King Day options: Proposition 301, which replaced [[Columbus Day]] on the list of paid state holidays, and Proposition 302, which merged [[Lincoln's Birthday|Lincoln's]] and [[Washington's Birthday|Washington's]] birthdays into one paid holiday to make room for MLK Day. Both measures failed to pass, with only 49% of voters approving Prop 302, the more popular of the two options; although some who voted "no" on 302 voted "yes" on Prop 301.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shumway|first1=Jim|title=STATE OF ARIZONA OFFICIAL CANVASS – GENERAL ELECTION – November 6, 1990|url=http://azsos.gov/sites/azsos.gov/files/canvass1990ge.pdf|website=Arizona Secretary of State ~ Home Page|publisher=Arizona Secretary of State|accessdate=April 11, 2015|page=12|format=PDF|date=November 26, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the state lost the chance to host Super Bowl XXVII, which was subsequently held at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref name="TucsonSentinel"/&gt; In a 1992 referendum, the voters, this time given only one option for a paid King Day, approved state-level recognition of the holiday.&lt;ref name="Reingold2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reingold|first=Beth|title=Representing Women: Sex, Gender, and Legislative Behavior in Arizona and California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENZoKQzCsk0C&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=May 4, 2014|year=2000|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807848500|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2000, South Carolina governor [[Jim Hodges]] signed a bill to make King's birthday an official state holiday. South Carolina was the last state to recognize the day as a paid holiday for all state employees. Prior to this, employees could choose between celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day or one of three [[Confederate holidays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/mlkhistory1.html The History of Martin Luther King Day], Infoplease&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names==
While all states now observe the holiday, some did not name the day after King. For example, in New Hampshire, the holiday was known as "Civil Rights Day" until 1999, when the State Legislature voted to change the name of the holiday to Martin Luther King Day.&lt;ref name="nyt99"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Carey |date=May 26, 1999 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E0DC1031F935A15756C0A96F958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Carey%20Goldberg%20Martin%20Luther%20King%201999&amp;st=cse |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnlpRF0r?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E0DC1031F935A15756C0A96F958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Carey%20Goldberg%20Martin%20Luther%20King%201999&amp;st=cse |title=Contrarian New Hampshire To Honor Dr. King, at Last |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several additional states have chosen to combine commemorations of King's birthday with other observances:
*In [[Alabama]]: "[[Robert E. Lee Day|Robert E. Lee]]/Martin Luther King Birthday".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Alabama.gov|url=http://inform.alabama.gov/calendar.aspx|title=Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Virginia]]: it was known as [[Lee–Jackson–King Day]], combining King's birthday with the established [[Lee–Jackson Day]].&lt;ref name="newcrisis"/&gt;  In 2000, Lee–Jackson Day was moved to the Friday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday in its own right.&lt;ref name="lege"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duran |first=April |date=April 10, 2000 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.has.vcu.edu/mac/cns/on-the-lege-2000/holiday.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnrGdKpp?url=http://www.has.vcu.edu/mac/cns/on-the-lege-2000/holiday.htm |title=Virginia creates holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. |newspaper=On The Lege |publisher=[[Virginia Commonwealth University]] |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Arkansas]]: it was known as "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday and [[Robert E. Lee Day|Robert E. Lee's Birthday]]" from 1985 to 2017. Legislation in March 2017 changed the name of the state holiday to "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday" and moved the commemoration of Lee to October.

==Workplace observance==
[[File:MLK Day March (Eugene, Oregon).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A Martin Luther King Day march in Oregon]]

Overall, in 2007, 33% of employers gave employees the day off, a 2% increase over the previous year. There was little difference in observance by large and small employers: 33% for firms with over 1,000 employees; and, 32% for firms with under 1,000 employees. The observance is most popular among nonprofit organizations and least popular among factories and manufacturers.&lt;ref name="bna"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cody |first=Karen James |date=January 9, 2007 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.bna.com/press/2007/specialreports/mlkday07.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnn7LcRx?url=http://www.bna.com/press/2007/specialreports/mlkday07.htm |title=More Employers Plan to Observe Martin Luther King Day |publisher=[[Bureau of National Affairs]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this have varied, ranging from the recent addition of the holiday, to its occurrence just two weeks after the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, when many businesses are closed for part or sometimes all of the week. Additionally, many schools and places of higher education are closed for classes; others remain open but may hold seminars or celebrations of King's message. The observance of MLK Day has led to some colleges and universities extending their Christmas break to include the day as part of break. Some factories and manufacturers used MLK Day as a [[Long weekend|floating or movable holiday]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==King Day of Service==
[[File:MLK service obama.JPG|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] serving lunch at a Washington soup kitchen on MLK Jr. Day, 2010]]

The national Martin Luther King Day of Service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nationalservice.gov/mlkday | title = Volunteer opportunities and resources for organizing an MLK Day of Service event | website = Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service homepage | publisher = Corporation for National and Community Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; was started by former Pennsylvania U.S. Senator [[Harris Wofford]] and Atlanta Congressman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], who co-authored the King Holiday and Service Act. The federal legislation challenges Americans to transform the King Holiday into a day of citizen action volunteer service in honor of King. The federal legislation was signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] on August 23, 1994. Since 1996, Wofford's former state office director, [[Todd Bernstein]], has been directing the annual Greater Philadelphia King Day of Service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlkdayofservice.org/|title=Greater Philadelphia Martin Luther King Day of Service|publisher=Global Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest event in the nation honoring King.&lt;ref name="slt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Doug |date=January 16, 2011 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_4429b5c3-3d55-5c08-81d4-e9ac71919ebe.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnstgaHT?url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_4429b5c3-3d55-5c08-81d4-e9ac71919ebe.html |title=MLK events in Missouri form man's legacy |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other universities and organizations around the U.S., such as [[Arizona State University]], Greater DC Cares and [[City Year]], participate in the Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service.  In honor of MLK, hundreds of Volunteer Centers, and volunteers across the country donate their time to make a difference on this day.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The only other official national day of service in the U.S., as designated by the government, is [[September 11 National Day of Service]] (9/11 Day).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Outside the United States==
One place outside the U.S. where Martin Luther King Jr. Day is observed in the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] under mayor [[Tadatoshi Akiba]], who holds a special banquet at the mayor's office as an act of unifying his city's call for peace with King's message of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp/shimin/heiwa/martin.html|title=Mayor's Speech at U.S. Conference of Mayors' Luncheon in commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.|website=www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of Toronto]], in Ontario, Canada, is another city that has officially recognized Martin Luther King Jr. Day, although not as a paid holiday: all government services and businesses remain open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=David |authorlink=David Miller (Canadian politician) |year=2008 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.toronto.ca/proclamations/2010/martinlutherkingjrday2010.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnpGaDSS?url=http://www.toronto.ca/proclamations/2010/martinlutherkingjrday2010.htm |title=City of Toronto Proclamation |publisher=[[City of Toronto]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, during a visit by the [[U.S. Sixth Fleet]], [[Navy Chaplain Corps|Navy chaplain]] Rabbi [[Arnold Resnicoff]] conducted the first Israeli presidential ceremony in commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, held in the [[Beit HaNassi|President's Residence]], Jerusalem. [[Aura Herzog]], wife of Israel's then-President [[Chaim Herzog]], noted that she was especially proud to host this special event, because Israel had a national forest in honor of King, and that Israel and King shared the idea of "dreams".&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Week &amp; The American Examiner'', pg 37, February 3, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Resnicoff continued this theme in his remarks during the ceremony, quoting the verse from Genesis, spoken by the brothers of Joseph when they saw their brother approach, "Behold the dreamer comes; let us slay him and throw him into the pit, and see what becomes of his dreams." Resnicoff noted that, from time immemorial, there have been those who thought they could kill the dream by slaying the dreamer, but – as the example of King's life shows – such people are always wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Veterans History Project Oral History, Arnold Resnicoff, May 2010.

Every year, since 1986, the Dr. Martin Luther King Tribute and Dinner is held in Wassenaar, The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nl.usembassy.gov/martin-luther-king-jr-tribute-dinner/|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. Tribute Dinner|last=|first=|date=2017-01-30|website=U.S. Embassy &amp; Consulate in the Netherlands|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribute includes young people and veterans of the Civil Rights Movement as well as music.  it always ends with everyone holding hands in a circle and singing "We Shall Overcome." The Tribute is held on the last Sunday in January and bridges Dr. King's birthday and [[Black History Month]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Material requirements planning''' ('''MRP''') is a  [[production planning]], [[scheduling]], and [[inventory]] control system used to [[management|manage]] [[manufacturing]] processes. Most MRP systems are [[computer software|software]]-based, but it is possible to conduct MRP by hand as well.

An MRP system is intended to simultaneously meet three objectives:

* Ensure materials are available for [[manufacturing|production]] and [[product (business)|products]] are available for [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]] to customers.
* Maintain the lowest possible material and product levels in store
* Plan manufacturing activities, delivery schedules and [[purchasing]] activities.

== History ==
Prior to MRP, and before computers dominated industry, [[Reorder point|reorder point (ROP)]]/reorder-quantity (ROQ) type methods like [[Economic order quantity|EOQ (economic order quantity)]] had been used in manufacturing and inventory management.&lt;ref&gt;Uday Karmarkar, Getting Control of Just-in-Time, Harvard Business Review 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

MRP was created initially to supply the Polaris program then, in 1964, as a response to the [[Toyota Production System|Toyota Manufacturing Program]], [[Joseph Orlicky]] developed material requirements planning (MRP). The first company to use MRP was [[Black &amp; Decker]] in 1964, with Dick Alban as project leader. Orlicky's 1975 book ''Material Requirements Planning'' has the subtitle ''The New Way of Life in Production and Inventory Management''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Orlicky, Materials Requirement Planning, McGraw-Hill 1975&lt;/ref&gt; By 1975, MRP was implemented in 700 companies. This number had grown to about 8,000 by 1981.

In 1983, [[Oliver Wight]] developed MRP into [[manufacturing resource planning]] (MRP II).&lt;ref&gt;WJ Hopp, ML Spearman ''Commissioned Paper To Pull or Not to Pull: What Is the Question?'' Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, Joe Orlicky's MRP evolved into Oliver Wight's manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) which brings master scheduling, rough-cut capacity planning, [[capacity planning|capacity requirements planning]], S&amp;OP in 1983 and other concepts to classical MRP. By 1989, about one third of the [[software industry]] was MRP II software sold to American industry ($1.2 billion worth of software).&lt;ref&gt;IE. 1991. Competition in manufacturing leads to MRP II. 23 (July) 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The scope of MRP in manufacturing ==

===Dependent demand vs independent demand===

Independent demand is demand originating outside the plant or production system, while dependent demand is demand for components. The [[bill of materials]] (BOM) specifies the relationship between the [[Product (business)|end product]] (independent demand) and the components (dependent demand). MRP takes as input the information contained in the BOM.&lt;ref&gt;J.Orlicky, Net Change Material Requirement Planning, IBM Systems J. 1973 in Jos Peeters, Early MRP Systems at Royal Phillips Electronics in the 1960s and 1970s, Annals of the History of Computing, IEEE 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011" /&gt;

The basic functions of an MRP system include: [[inventory control]], [[bill of material]] processing, and elementary scheduling. MRP helps organizations to maintain low inventory levels. It is used to plan manufacturing, purchasing and delivering activities.

"Manufacturing organizations, whatever their products, face the same daily practical problem - that customers want products to be available in a shorter time than it takes to make them. This means that some level of planning is required."

Companies need to control the types and quantities of materials they purchase, plan which products are to be produced and in what quantities and ensure that they are able to meet current and future customer demand, all at the lowest possible cost. Making a bad decision in any of these areas will make the company lose money. A few examples are given below:

* If a company purchases insufficient quantities of an item used in manufacturing (or the wrong item) it may be unable to meet contract obligations to supply products on time.
* If a company purchases excessive quantities of an item, money is wasted - the excess quantity ties up cash while it remains as stock that might never be used at all.
* Beginning production of an order at the wrong time can cause customer deadlines to be missed.

MRP is a tool to deal with these problems. It provides answers for several questions:
* ''What'' items are required?
* ''How many'' are required?
* ''When'' are they required?...

MRP can be applied both to items that are purchased from outside suppliers and to sub-assemblies, produced internally, that are components of more complex items.

===Data===

The data that must be considered include:

* The ''end item'' (or items) being created. This is sometimes called independent demand, or Level "0" on BOM ([[bill of materials]]).
* How much is required at a time.
* When the quantities are required to meet demand.
* [[Shelf life]] of stored materials.
* Inventory status records. Records of ''net'' materials ''available'' for use already in stock (on hand) and materials on order from suppliers.
* Bills of materials. Details of the materials, components and sub-assemblies required to make each product.
* Planning data. This includes all the restraints and directions to produce such items as: [[routing]], labor and machine standards, quality and testing standards, pull/work cell and push commands, lot sizing techniques (i.e. fixed lot size, lot-for-lot, economic order quantity), scrap percentages, and other inputs.

===Outputs===

There are two outputs and a variety of messages/reports:

* Output 1 is the "Recommended Production Schedule." This lays out a detailed schedule of the required minimum start and completion dates, with quantities, for each step of the Routing and Bill Of Material required to satisfy the demand from the [[master production schedule]] (MPS).
* Output 2 is the "Recommended Purchasing Schedule." This lays out both the dates on which the purchased items should be received into the facility ''and'' the dates on which the [[purchase order]]s or blanket order release should occur in order to match the production schedules.

Messages and reports:
* [[Purchase order]]s. An order to a supplier to provide materials.
* Reschedule notices. These ''recommend'' cancelling, increasing, delaying or speeding up existing orders.

===Methods to find order quantities===

Well-known methods to find order quantities are:
* [[Dynamic lot-sizing]] 
* [[Silver–Meal heuristic]]
* [[Least-unit-cost heuristic]]

===Mathematical formulation===

MRP can be expressed as an [[optimal control]] problem:&lt;ref name="Zipkin2000"&gt;Zipkin Paul H., Foundations of Inventory Management, Boston: McGraw Hill, 2000, {{ISBN|0-256-11379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| cellpadding="2" style="border:1px solid darkgray;"
|- border=0;
| Initial conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;x'_{i}(0)=x'_{i0}&lt;/math&gt;    i=1,...,J
Dynamics:
:&lt;math&gt;x'_{i}(t+1)=x'_{i}(t)+z_{i}(t)-d'_{i}(t)-\sum_{j\epsilon Suc(i)}z_{j}(t+L'_{ij}-1)&lt;/math&gt; 
:t=0,...,T-1,i=1,...,J
Constraints:
:&lt;math&gt;x'_{i}(t)\geq0&lt;/math&gt;    t=1,...,T,i=1,...,J
:&lt;math&gt;z_{i}(t)\geq0&lt;/math&gt;    t=0,...,T-1,i=1,...,J
Objective:
:&lt;math&gt;min \sum_{i}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\left[ k_{i}(t)\delta(z_{i}(t)) + c_{i}(t)z_{i}(t) \right]+\sum_{i}\sum_{t=1}^{T} h'_{i}(t)x'_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Where ''x' '' is local inventory ([[state variable|the state]]), ''z'' the order size ([[control variable|the control]]), ''d'' is local demand, ''k'' represents fixed order costs, ''c'' variable order costs, ''h'' local inventory holding costs. δ() is the [[Heaviside function]]. Changing the dynamics of the problem leads to a multi-item analogue of the [[dynamic lot-size model]].&lt;ref name="Zipkin2000"/&gt;

== Problems with MRP systems ==
*Integrity of the data. If there are any errors in the inventory data, the [[bill of materials]] (commonly referred to as 'BOM') data, or the [[master production schedule]], then the output data will also be incorrect ("GIGO": [[garbage in, garbage out]]). Data integrity is also affected by inaccurate cycle count adjustments, mistakes in receiving input and shipping output, scrap not reported, waste, damage, box count errors, supplier container count errors, production reporting errors, and system issues. Many of these type of errors can be minimized by implementing [[Push–pull strategy|pull]] systems and using [[bar code]] scanning. Most vendors in this type of system recommend at least 99% data integrity for the system to give useful results.
*Systems require that the user specify how long it will take for a factory to make a product from its component parts (assuming they are all available).  Additionally, the system design also assumes that this "lead time" in manufacturing will be the same each time the item is made, without regard to quantity being made, or other items being made simultaneously in the factory.
*A manufacturer may have factories in different cities or even countries.  It is not good for an MRP system to say that we do not need to order some material, because we have plenty of it thousands of miles away.  The overall [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] system needs to be able to organize inventory and needs by individual factory and inter-communicate the needs in order to enable each factory to redistribute components to serve the overall enterprise. This means that other systems in the enterprise need to work properly, both before implementing an MRP system and in the future. For example, systems like variety reduction and engineering, which makes sure that product comes out right first time (without defects), must be in place.
*Production may be in progress for some part, whose design gets changed, with customer orders in the system for both the old design, and the new one, concurrently. The overall [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] system needs to have a system of coding parts such that the MRP will correctly calculate needs and tracking for both versions. Parts must be booked into and out of stores more regularly than the MRP calculations take place. Note, these other systems can well be manual systems, but must interface to the MRP. For example, a 'walk around' stock intake done just prior to the MRP calculations can be a practical solution for a small inventory (especially if it is an "open store").
*The other major drawback of MRP is that it fails to account for capacity in its calculations. This means it will give results that are impossible to implement due to [[manpower]], machine or supplier capacity constraints. However this is largely dealt with by [[Manufacturing resource planning|MRP II]]. Generally, MRP II refers to a system with integrated financials. An MRP II system can include finite or infinite capacity planning. But, to be considered a true MRP II system must also include financials. In the [[Manufacturing resource planning|MRP II]] (or MRP2) concept, fluctuations in forecast data are taken into account by including simulation of the master production schedule, thus creating a long-term control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste | author-link = Jean-Baptiste Waldner |title = CIM: Principles of Computer Integrated Manufacturing |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons |place = Chichester | year = 1992| page = 46 |isbn = 0-471-93450-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more general feature of MRP2 is its extension to purchasing, to marketing and to finance (integration of all the functions of the company), ERP has been the next step.

===Solutions to data integrity issues===
Source:&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011" /&gt;

*Bill of material – The best practice is to physically verify the bill of material either at the production site or by disassembling the product.
*Cycle count – The best practice is to determine why a cycle count that increases or decreases inventory has occurred. Find the root cause and correct the problem from occurring again.
*Scrap reporting – This can be the most difficult area to maintain with any integrity. Start with isolating the scrap by providing scrap bins at the production site and then record the scrap from the bins on a daily basis. One benefit of reviewing the scrap on site is that preventive action can be taken by the engineering group.
*Receiving errors – Manual systems of recording what has been received are error prone. The best practice is to implement the system of receiving by ASN from the supplier. The supplier sends an ASN ([[Advance ship notice|advanced shipping notification]]). When the components are received into the facility, the ASN is processed and then company labels are created for each line item. The labels are affixed to each container and then scanned into the MRP system. Extra labels reveal a shortage from the shipment and too few labels reveal an over shipment. Some companies pay for ASN by reducing the time in processing accounts payable.
*Shipping errors – The container labels are printed from the shipper. The labels are affixed to the containers in a staging area or when they are loaded on the transport.
*Production reporting – The best practice is to use bar code scanning to enter production into inventory. A product that is rejected should be moved to an MRB (material review board) location. Containers that require sorting need to be received in reverse.
*Replenishment – The best replenishment practice is replacement using bar code scanning, or via pull system. Depending upon the complexity of the product, planners can actually order materials using scanning with a min-max system.

== Demand driven MRP ==

In 2011, the third edition of "Orlicky's Materials Requirements Planning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orlicky's Materials Requirements Planning|last1=Ptak|first1=Carol|last2=Smith|first2=Chad|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-175563-4|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" introduced a new type of MRP called "demand driven MRP" (DDMRP).&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011"&gt;Ptak, Carol and Smith, Chad (2011). ''Orlicky's MRP 3rd edition'', McGraw Hill, New York {{ISBN|978-0-07-175563-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The new edition of the book was written, not by Orlicky himself (he died in 1986) but by Carol Ptak and Chad Smith at the invitation of [[McGraw Hill]] to update Orlicky's work.

Demand driven MRP is a multi-echelon formal planning and execution technique with five distinct components:&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011"/&gt;
# '''Strategic inventory positioning''' – The first question of effective inventory management is not, "how much inventory should we have?"  Nor is it, "when should we [[make or buy]] something?" The most fundamental question to ask in today's manufacturing environments is, "given our system and environment, where should we place inventory to have the best protection?"  Inventory is like a break wall to protect boats in a [[marina]] from the roughness of incoming waves.  Out on the open ocean the break walls have to be 50–100 feet tall, but in a small lake the break walls are only a couple feet tall.  In a glassy smooth [[pond]] no break wall is necessary.
# '''Buffer profiles and level''' – Once the strategically replenished positions are determined, the actual levels of those buffers have to be initially set.  Based on several factors, different materials and parts behave differently (but many also behave nearly the same).  DDMRP calls for the grouping of parts and materials chosen for strategic replenishment and that behave similarly into "buffer profiles."  Buffer profiles take into account important factors including [[lead time]] (relative to the environment), [[Statistical variability|variability]] (demand or supply), whether the part is made or bought or distributed and whether there are significant order multiples involved.  These buffer profiles are made up of "zones" that produce a unique buffer picture for each part as their respective individual part traits are applied to the group traits. 
# '''Dynamic adjustments''' – Over the course of time, group and individual traits can and will change as new suppliers and materials are used, new [[Market (economics)|market]]s are opened and/or old markets deteriorate and manufacturing capacities and methods change.  Dynamic buffer levels allow the company to adapt buffers to group and individual part trait changes over time through the use of several types of adjustments.  Thus, as more or less variability is encountered or as a company's strategy changes these buffers adapt and change to fit the environment.
# '''Demand-driven planning''' – takes advantage of the sheer computational power of today's hardware and software.  It also takes advantage of the new demand-driven or [[Push–pull strategy|pull]]-based approaches.  When these two elements are combined then there is the best of both worlds; relevant approaches and tools for the way the world works today ''and'' a system of routine that promotes better and quicker decisions and actions at the planning and execution level.
# '''Highly visible and collaborative execution''' – Simply launching [[purchase order]]s (POs), manufacturing orders (MOs) and transfer orders (TOs) from any planning system does not end the materials and order management challenge.  These POs, MOs and TOs have to be effectively managed to synchronize with the changes that often occur within the "execution horizon." The execution horizon is the time from which a PO, MO or TO is opened until the time it is closed in the system of record.  DDMRP defines a modern, integrated and greatly needed system of execution for all part categories in order to speed the proliferation of relevant information and priorities throughout an organization and supply chain.

These five components work together to greatly dampen, if not eliminate, the nervousness of traditional MRP systems and the [[bullwhip effect]] in complex and challenging environments. The Demand Driven Institute claims the following: In utilizing these approaches, planners will no longer have to try to respond to every single message for every single part that is off by even one day. This approach provides real information about those parts that are truly at risk of negatively impacting the planned availability of inventory. DDMRP sorts the significant few items that require attention from the many parts that are being managed. Under the DDMRP approach, fewer planners can make better decisions more quickly.  That means companies will be better able to leverage their working and human capital as well as the huge investments they have made in information technology. One down-side, however, is that DDMRP can not run on the majority of MRPII/ERP systems in use today, so organisations will have to implement a compatible system in order to run DDMRP. 

DDMRP has been successfully applied to a variety of environments including CTO ([[configure to order]]), MTS ([[make to stock]]), MTO ([[make to order]]) and ETO ([[engineer to order]]).&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011"/&gt; The methodology is applied differently in each environments but the five step process remains the same.  DDMRP leverages knowledge from [[theory of constraints]] (TOC), traditional MRP &amp; [[Distribution resource planning|DRP]], [[Six Sigma]] and [[Lean manufacturing|lean]]. It is effectively an amalgam of MRP and kanban techniques. As such, it incorporates the strengths of both but also the weaknesses of both; hence its limited adoption.

==Career==
Shirima started [[Precision Air]] in 1993, with a twin-engine five-seater airplane, a [[Piper PA-23|Piper Aztec]]. Using [[Arusha]] as its base, the airline began by providing [[charter flight]]s to tourists visiting [[Serengeti National Park]], [[Ngorongoro Crater]], the island of [[Unguja]], and other tourist attractions in Tanzania. As customer numbers grew, the airline acquired more equipment and began scheduled flights maintaining Arusha as its base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.precisionairtz.com/index.php?page=company-profile Shirima Founded Precision Air In 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Kenya Airways, the largest airline in [[East Africa]], acquired 49% shareholding in Precision Air for a cash sum of US$2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/case_studies.htm?articleid=1917143&amp;show=html Kenya Airlines Paid US$2 million for 49% Shareholding In Precision Air]&lt;/ref&gt;

Precision Air is headquartered in [[Dar es Salaam]], the largest city in Tanzania. In October 2011, Precision Air floated 30.35 percent shareholding in the airline stock, in an [[Initial Public Offering]] on the [[Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201110180022.html Precision Air Becomes A Publicly Traded Company]&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|June 2012}}, Kenyan press reports indicated that Michael Shirima is the largest shareholder in the [[stock]] of the airline with 42.91 percent shareholding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Precision+Air+gets+Sh510+million+IFC+boost+/-/539552/1427660/-/item/0/-/144vf5sz/-/index.html Shareholding In Precision Air In June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other responsibilities==
In addition to his aviation interests, Shirima owns five percent of the stock of [[I&amp;M Bank (Tanzania)]], a medium-sized commercial bank. As of December 2011, the bank's total assets were valued at about US$130 million (TZS:200 billion) and the bank's shareholders' equity had approximately US$15 million (TZS:23 billion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imbank.com/TZ/?od=report  December 2011 Financial Report] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130126020326/http://www.imbank.com/TZ/?od=report |date=2013-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also sits on the [[Board of Directors]] of the same bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imbank.com/TZ/?od=director Michael Shirima Is Board Member of I&amp;M Bank Tanzania] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130126072629/http://www.imbank.com/TZ/?od=director |date=2013-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Near net shape''' is an industrial manufacturing technique. The name implies that the initial production of the item is very close to the final (net) shape, reducing the need for [[surface finishing]].   Reducing traditional finishing such as [[machining]] or [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] eliminates more than two-thirds of the production costs in some industries.

'''Poetaster''' {{IPAc-en|p|oʊ|ɪ|t|æ|s|t|ɚ}}, like '''rhymester''' or '''versifier''', is a derogatory term applied to bad or inferior poets. Specifically, ''poetaster'' has implications of unwarranted pretensions to artistic value. The word was coined in [[Latin]] by [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, ''Letters'' 25 March 1521 (see ''Oxford English Dictionary'' s.v. "Poetaster").&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used in [[English language|English]] by [[Ben Jonson]] in his 1600 play ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, ''[http://hollowaypages.com/jonson1692cynthia.htm Cynthia's Revels]'' act 2 scene 4.&lt;/ref&gt; immediately afterwards Jonson chose it as the title of his 1601 play ''[[Poetaster (play)|Poetaster]].'' In that play the "poetaster" character is a satire on [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], one of Jonson's rivals in the Poetomachia or [[War of the Theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ben Jonson'' ed. C. H. Herford, P. and E. Simpson, vol. 9 (Oxford, 1950) p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
While ''poetaster'' has always been a negative appraisal of a poet's skills, ''rhymester'' (or ''rhymer'') and ''versifier'' have held ambiguous meanings depending on the commentator's opinion of a writer's [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].  ''Versifier'' is often used to refer to someone who produces work in verse with the implication that while technically able to make lines rhyme they have no real talent for poetry.  '''Rhymer''' on the other hand is usually impolite despite attempts to salvage the reputation of rhymers such as the [[Rhymers' Club]] and Rhymer being a common last name.

The faults of a poetaster frequently include errors or lapses in their work's meter, badly rhyming words which jar rather than flow, oversentimentality, too much use of the [[pathetic fallacy]] and unintentionally [[Bathos|bathetic]] choice of subject matter.{{Original research?|date=February 2009}}  Although a mundane subject in the hands of some great poets can be raised to the level of art, such as ''[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]]'' by [[John Keats]] or ''[[s: Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat, Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes|Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat, Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes]]'' by [[Thomas Gray]], others merely produce bizarre poems on bizarre subjects,  an example being [[James McIntyre (poet)|James McIntyre]], who wrote mainly of cheese.

Other poets often regarded as poetasters are [[William Topaz McGonagall]], [[Julia A. Moore]], [[Edgar Guest]], [[Dmitry Khvostov]], and [[Alfred Austin]].  Austin, despite having been a British [[poet laureate]], is nevertheless regarded as greatly inferior to his predecessor, [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]; he was frequently mocked during his career and is little read today. The American poet [[Joyce Kilmer]] (1886–1918), known for his 1913 poem [[Trees (poem)|"Trees"]], is often criticized for his overly sentimental and traditional verse written at the dawn of [[Modernist poetry]], although some of his poems are frequently anthologized and retain enduring popular appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Holliday, Robert Cortes. "Memoir", in Joyce Kilmer, edited by Holliday (New York: Doran, 1918), I: 17–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aiken, Conrad Potter. "Confectionery and Caviar: Edward Bliss Reed, John Cowper Powys, Joyce Kilmer, Theodosia Garrison, William Carlos Williams" in ''Scepticisms''. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1919), 178–86.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Trees" has been parodied innumerable times, including notably parody by [[Ogden Nash]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Ogden. "Song of the Open Road" first published in ''Argosy''. Vol. 12 No. 8. (July 1951), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
Musician [[Joanna Newsom]] on the album [[The Milk-Eyed Mender|''The Milk-eyed Mender'']] uses the term to refer to a struggling narrator wracked with ambition to create beautiful poetry in a verse from "Inflammatory Writ":

:And as for my inflammatory writ?
:Well, I wrote it and I was not inflamed one bit.
:Advice from the master derailed that disaster;
:he said "Hand that pen over to me, poetaster"

Rapper [[Big Daddy Kane]] uses an adjectival form as an insult in his song "Uncut, Pure":

:Your poetasterous style it plain bore me
:Pardon the vainglory, but here's the Kane story

The band [[Miracle Fortress]] has a song entitled "Poetaster".

==Variants==
In the sense that a poetaster is a pretended poet, John Marston coined the term ''parasitaster,'' for one who pretends to be a parasite or sycophant, in his play ''[[Parasitaster, or The Fawn]]'' (1604). Later in the 17th century (the earliest cited use is from 1684) appeared the term ''criticaster'' for an inferior and pretentious critic.

He was the CEO of Banco Intercontinental (BANINTER) from 1993 until its collapse in 2003; he and his father controlled at least 80% of the shares. He was lionized as the Dominican ''[[King Midas]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

In 2001, BANINTER alone was worth RD$25.57 billion or US$1.51 billion (US${{Inflation|US|1.51|1997|r=2}} billion in {{currentyear}} prices).&lt;ref name=pciudadana/&gt;

==BANINTER crisis==
Báez Figueroa was arrested May 15, 2003 along with BANINTER vice presidents Marcos Báez Cocco and Vivian Lubrano de Castillo, the secretary of the Board of Directors, Jesús M. Troncoso, and financer [[Luis Álvarez Renta]], on charges of [[bank fraud]], [[money laundering]] and concealing information from the government as part of a massive fraud scheme of more than [[Dominican peso|RD$]]&amp;nbsp;55 billion (USD&amp;nbsp;$2.2 billion). This sum would be big anywhere, but it was overwhelming for the [[Economy of the Dominican Republic|Dominican economy]], equivalent to two-thirds of its national budget.

The resulting central bank bailout spurred 30 percent annual inflation and a large increase in poverty. The government was forced to devalue the peso, triggering the collapse of two other banks, and prompting a [[US$]]&amp;nbsp;600 million (420 million [[€]]) loan package from the International Monetary Fund.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071021/ap_on_bi_ge/dominican_bank_fraud_trial_1&lt;/ref&gt;

The banking crisis ignited harsh fights over the bank group’s media outlets, including the prominent newspaper [[Listín Diario]], which was temporarily seized and run by the [[Mejía administration]] following the BANINTER collapse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Moreover, it was prompted, as detailed at length in the trial that opened in April 2006, by a scandal involving debt writeoffs and sweetheart loans or other financial deals suspected of having favored leading politicians and others.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20071021/bs_nm/dominican_fraud_dc_2&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors that Baninter might have been in trouble began circulating during fall of 2002, and depositors started to withdraw their savings. The [[Dominican Central Bank]] stepped in to support the bank by providing new lines of credit. Anxious for a more permanent solution, the government announced in early 2003 that [[Banco del Progreso]], run by Pedro Castillo, the brother of Mr.&amp;nbsp;Mejía’s son-in-law, would acquire Baninter. But Banco del Progreso abruptly withdrew from the deal. Government officials said that two-thirds of the money that customers had deposited in Baninter was kept off its official books by a custom-designed software system. Banking regulators and the bank’s auditor, [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], were deceived for years.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In April 2003, the government took control of Baninter. Mr.&amp;nbsp;Báez Figueroa’s family owned more than the 80% of the bank, and soon after, a deeper examination supported by the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank, revealed the scale of the meltdown.

With 350 prosecution and defense witnesses slated to testify, ex-President [[Hipólito Mejía]] among them, the criminal proceedings against Mr.&amp;nbsp;Báez Figueroa began on April 2, 2006. However, the Collegiate Court decided to postpone the first hearing for May 19, 2006, accepting a  motion by the defense lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Dominicant Today, April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentence==
On October 21, 2007, after the long trial that concluded on September, Báez Figueroa was sentenced by a three-judge panel to 10 years in prison. Additionally, he was ordered to pay restitution and damages totalling more than $31 million. The laundering charges were excluded, but another suspected mastermind of the fraud, financier Luis Álvarez Renta, was convicted and sentenced for money laundering to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iii.co.uk/news/?type=reutersnews&amp;articleid=MTFH30180_2007-10-21_20-20-49_N21382897&amp;feed=Bus&amp;action=article Business finance news - currency market news - online UK currency markets - financial news - Interactive Investor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcos Báez Cocco]], ex-vicepresident of the Bank, was also found guilty, but his sentence will be read on November 16.

Their defence attorneys said they would appeal.

The accusations against two other defendants, Báez’s personal assistant and former Baninter vicepresident Vivian Lubrano, as well as the secretary of the Baninter Board of Directors Jesús M. Troncoso, were dismissed for lack of evidence.

==Supporters==
Friends of Báez Figueroa, groping to explain the shortcuts he took in running BANINTER, pointed to his political connections and a lack of competent managers at the bank. Báez Figueroa's lawyer, [[Marino Vinicio Castillo]], said in an interview that the whole affair had been trumped up for political reasons, and that the claim that RD$55 billion had been embezzled was "a fable." Castillo went on to say that "very dark interests within the government that are blinded by ambition" were behind his client's imprisonment. He accused the government of wanting to dismember BANINTER and divide the spoils. [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] had audited Baninter's books for years and approved them "without any reservations," Mr. Castillo said. {{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

His defenders also say former President Mejía saw Báez Figueroa as a threat to his personal wealth and political influence and to Mejía's ambition to win another term in office. Taking control of BANINTER's media properties and using them to win over public opinion, not cleaning up a scandal, was what the government was after.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Even after his arrest Báez Figueroa remained a central figure in the country's elite, readily accessible even in jail. Within days of his arrest, he received visits from president Leonel Fernández and Hatuey de Camps, then president of the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Smith|title=Fallen Banker Courted in Jail Cell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/27/business/worldbusiness/27DOMI.html|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=23 May 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422121502/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/27/business/worldbusiness/27DOMI.html|archivedate=22 April 2014|publisher=The New York Times|location=Santo Domingo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resource distribution''' refers to the distribution of [[resource (economics)|resources]], including [[Land (economics)|land]], [[water]], [[mineral]]s, [[fuel]] and [[distribution of wealth|wealth in general]] among corresponding geographic entities (states, countries, etc.).

== Unequal resource distribution ==
{{Main|Economic inequality}}

The most common use of this concept has not been in examining the unequal distribution of resources among nation states. Such unequal distribution of resources was commonly related to land for [[agriculture]], necessary for [[population growth]].  A more recent emphasis has been on differences from the unequal dispersion of [[technological progress]].

== International trade ==

The growth of [[international trade]] is an aspect of [[globalization]] in the later 20th Century (see [[OECD]]), which has affected [[international relations]]. Increased international trade from the removal of [[trade barrier]]s has narrowed income distribution among some nation states. Many wealthier countries export non-land-intensive goods and services in return for  agricultural and animal products, as illustrated by Japan.

'''Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke''' (of the first creation), Lord of [[Leinster]], [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland|Justiciar of Ireland]] (1130{{snd}}20 April 1176) was an Anglo-Norman&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-FitzGilbert-2nd-Earl-of-Pembroke|title=Richard FitzGilbert, 2nd earl of Pembroke {{!}} Anglo-Norman lord|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; nobleman notable for his leading role in the [[Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Like his father, Richard fitz Gilbert has since become commonly known by his nickname '''Strongbow''' ([[Norman French]]: ''Arc-Fort'') which may be a mistranscription or mistranslation of [[Striguil]].

His son Gilbert de Striguil, or Strigoil, died unmarried before 1189. As a minor, he never became an earl, thus the earldom was passed with Richard's daughter Isabel to her spouse William Marshall.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt;

==Cognomen==
Richard's cognomen '''Strongbow''' has become the name he is best known by, but it is unlikely that he was called that at the time. Cognomens of other Cambro-Norman and Norman lords were exclusively Norman-French as the nobility spoke French and, with few exceptions, official documents were written in Latin during this period. The confusion seems to have arisen when Richard's name was being translated into Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich Castle and the families of Godric Mapson, Monmouth, Clare, Marshall, Montchesney, Valence, Despenser and Talbot&lt;/ref&gt; In the Domesday Exchequer annals between 1300 and 1304 (over 120 years after his death) it was written as "''Ricardus cognomento Stranghose Comes Strugulliae'' (Richard known as Stranghose earl of Striguil)." This chronicler erroneously has attributed Stranghose (foreign leggings) as a cognomen, where it is much more likely a variant spelling or mistranscription of Striguil, which is called Strangboge, Stranboue or Stranbohe in other transcriptions. It is in the fourteenth century that we have Richard's name finally rendered as Strongbow "Earl Richard son of Gilbert Strongbow [earl of Shropshire]."&lt;ref&gt;Brut y Tywysogyon or The Chronicle of the Princes. Peniarth Ms. 20 version, ed. and trans. T. Jones [Cardiff, 1952], 65. Richard vabGilbert Stragbow[iarll Amhwydic], Brenhinedd y Saeson or The Kings of the Saxons, ed. and trans. T. Jones [Cardiff, 1971], 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Richard was the son of [[Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke]] and Isabel de Beaumont.&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times, Vol. X, eds. H. A. Doubleday; Geoffrey H. White; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1945), p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's father died in about 1148, when he was roughly 18 years old, and Richard inherited the title 'count of Strigoil' [[Earl of Pembroke]]. It is probable that this title was not recognized at Henry II's coronation in 1154.&lt;ref&gt;M. T. Flanagan, 'Clare, Richard fitz Gilbert de, second earl of Pembroke (c.1130–1176)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; As the son of the first 'earl', he succeeded to his father's estates in 1148,&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Pembroke, Earls of|volume=21|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was deprived of the title by King [[Henry II of England]] in 1154 for siding with King [[Stephen of England]] against Henry's mother, the [[Empress Matilda]].&lt;ref name="HII193"&gt;Wilfred Lewis Warren, ''Henry II'' (Berkeley; Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1973), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Richard was in fact, called by his contemporaries Count Striguil, for his [[Marcher Lord|marcher lordship]] of [[Striguil]] where he had a fortress at a place now called [[Chepstow Castle|Chepstow]], in [[Monmouthshire]] on the [[River Wye]].&lt;ref&gt;Goddard Henry Orpen, ''Ireland under the Normans, 1169–1216'', Vol. 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1911), pp. 85–9&lt;/ref&gt; He saw an opportunity to reverse his bad fortune in 1168 when he met [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], the deposed King of [[Kingdom of Leinster|Leinster]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Lewis Warren, ''Henry II'' (Berkeley; Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1973), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispossession of the King of Leinster===
In 1167, Diarmait Mac Murchada (Dermot MacMurrough) was deprived of the [[Kings of Leinster|Kingdom of Leinster]] by the [[High King of Ireland]] – [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]]. The grounds for the dispossession were that Mac Murchada had, in 1152, abducted [[Derbforgaill]], the wife of the [[Kingdom of Breifne|King of Breifne]], [[Tighearnán Ua Ruairc|Tiernan O'Rourke]] ({{lang-ga|Tighearnán Ua Ruairc}}). To recover his kingdom, Mac Murchada solicited help from the King of England – [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. The deposed king embarked for [[Bristol]] from near [[Bannow]] on 1 August 1166.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of Ireland'', ed. R. F. Foster (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He met Henry in [[Aquitaine]] in the Autumn of 1166. Henry could not help him at this time, but provided a letter of comfort for willing supporters of Mac Murchada's cause in his kingdom. However, after his return to [[Wales]], he failed to rally any forces to his standard. He eventually met the count of Striguil (nicknamed "Strongbow") and other barons of the [[Welsh Marches]]. Mac Murchada came to an agreement with Richard de Clare: for the Earl's assistance with an army the following spring, he could have [[Aoife MacMurrough|Aoife]], Mac Murchada's eldest daughter in marriage and the succession to Leinster.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard Henry Orpen, ''Ireland under the Normans, 1169–1216'', Vol. 1 (Oxford: Clarendon press, 1911), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; As Henry's approval or licence to Mac Murchada was a general one, the count of Striguil thought it prudent to obtain Henry's specific consent to travel to Ireland: he waited two years to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard Henry Orpen, ''Ireland under the Normans, 1169–1216'', Vol. 1 (Oxford: Clarendon press, 1911), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The licence he got was to aid Mac Murchada in the recovery of his kingdom of Leinster.&lt;ref name="HII193"/&gt;

===The re-taking of Leinster===

{{see also|Norman invasion of Ireland}}

Mac Murchada and Richard de Clare raised a large army, which included [[Wales|Welsh]] archers and arranged for [[Raymond FitzGerald]] (also known as Raymond ''le Gros'') to lead it. The force took the Ostman towns of [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]], and [[Dublin]]&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;These were ''[[longphort]]s'' where the Viking raiders settled, marrying Gaelic women and slightly acculturating to Gaelic customs (such as naming practices, MacGiollamhuire, MacTurkill, etc.), Dublin being the most famous. See: James F. Lydon, ''The Making of Ireland: From Ancient Times to Present'' (London; New York: Routledge, 1998), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; in rapid succession between 1169 and 1170.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard Henry Orpen, ''Ireland under the Normans, 1169–1216'', Vol. 1 (Oxford: Clarendon press, 1911), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Richard de Clare, however, was not with the first invading party and arrived later, in August 1170.&lt;ref&gt;John Davies, ''A History of Wales'' (London: Penguin Group, 1993), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1171, Diarmait Mac Murchada died and his son, [[Donal MacMurrough-Kavanagh]] ({{lang-ga|Domhnall Caemanach mac Murchada}}), claimed the kingdom of Leinster in accordance with his rights under the [[Brehon Laws]]. Richard de Clare also claimed the kingship in the right of his wife. At this time, Strongbow sent his uncle, [[Hervey de Montmorency]], on an embassy to Henry II. This was necessary to appease the King who was growing restive at the count's increasing power. Upon his return, de Montmorency conveyed the King's terms – the return of Richard de Clare's lands in France, England, and Wales as well as leaving him in possession of his Irish lands.&lt;ref&gt;A J Otway-Ruthven; Kathleen Hughes, "A History of Medieval Ireland", (London: Ernest Benn Limited; New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Inc., 1968), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Richard de Clare surrendered Dublin, Waterford, and other fortresses to the English king.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Lewis Warren, ''Henry II'' (New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 2000), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's intervention was successful and both the Gaelic and Norman lords in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Lewis Warren, ''Henry II'' (New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 2000), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Richard de Clare also agreed to assist Henry II in his coming [[Revolt of 1173–74|war in France]].

Henry crossed over  to Ireland in October 1172 and stayed in Ireland six months. He put his own men into nearly all the important places, Richard keeping only Kildare. In 1173 Richard went in person to France to help Henry II during the [[Revolt of 1173–74|rebellion by his sons]], being reinstated in Leinster as a reward. In 1174 he advanced into [[Connacht|Connaught]] and was severely defeated, but fortunately [[Raymond FitzGerald]] re-established his supremacy in Leinster.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
[[Image:MarriageAoifeStrongbow.jpg|thumb|right|''The Marriage of Strongbow and Aoife'' (1854) by [[Daniel Maclise]], a romanticised depiction of the union in the ruins of [[Waterford]]]]
By an unknown mistress, Richard de Clare fathered two daughters:
* Aline de Clare,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Aline was born well before her father married Eve (Aoife), daughter of Dermot. That both she and her unnamed sister were illegitimate is indicated by the fact that neither inherited anything from their father's great holdings. See: Cokayne, ''CP'', X, Appendix H, 103&lt;/ref&gt; who married William FitzMaurice FitzGerald, baron of Naas&lt;ref name="CPX-H103"&gt;George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times, Vol. X, eds. H. A. Doubleday; Geoffrey H. White; &amp; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1945), Appendix H, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;
* Basilia de Clare, who married Robert de Quenci, Constable of Leinster&lt;ref name="CPX-H103"/&gt;

On about 26 August 1171 in [[Waterford]], Richard de Clare married MacMurrough's daughter, [[Aoife MacMurrough]] (anglicised as "Eva").&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times, Vol. X, eds. H. A. Doubleday; Geoffrey H. White; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1945), p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; Their children were:
* [[Gilbert de Clare, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], a minor who died in 1185&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times, Vol. X, eds. H. A. Doubleday; Geoffrey H. White; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1945), p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke]], who became Countess of Pembroke [[suo jure|in her own right]] in 1185 (on the death of her brother) until her own death in 1220.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}}&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times, Vol. X, eds. H. A. Doubleday; Geoffrey H. White; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1945), pp. 358–64&lt;/ref&gt;
King Henry II had promised [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|Sir William Marshal]] that he would be given Isabel as his bride, and his son [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] upheld the promise one month after his ascension to the throne. The earldom was given to her husband as her consort.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Costain ''The Conquering Family'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1962), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall was the son of [[John Marshal (Earl Marshal)|John the Marshal]], by Sibylle, the sister of [[Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Patrick, Earl of Salisbury]].

Richard de Clare died in June 1176 of some type of infection in his leg or foot. He was buried in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Holy Trinity Church]] in Dublin with his uncle-in-law, [[Lorcán Ua Tuathail|Lawrence]], Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin|Dublin]], presiding. King Henry II took all of Strongbow's lands and castles for himself and placed a royal official in charge of them. He guarded well the inheritance of Isabel. Eve was given her dower rights and possibly held Striguil [Chepstow] as part of those dower rights until the Welsh rebellion of 1184/85. There is a record of Eve confirming a charter in Ireland in 1188/89 as "comtissa de Hibernia".&lt;ref name="castlewales.com"&gt;http://www.castlewales.com/is_clare.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard de Clare's widow, [[Aoife MacMurrough|Aoife]], lived on and was last recorded in a charter of 1188.

There are no known extant records of the personal lives of Richard de Clare and Eve. We know that this young red-haired son of Gilbert de Clare Earl of Pembroke survived the years of being deprived of his rightful inheritance. He took the gamble that Dermot MacMurchada offered. He conquered and re-constituted his inherited lordship of Leinster, married the golden-haired Eve, and re-gained the respect of king Henry II. Two interesting questions arise for which there is no known extant contemporary records. Did Richard de Clare perhaps meet the man who would be his daughter's husband in the 1173 rebellion of the young King Henry? Would Richard de Clare have approved of the knight William Marshal who married his daughter Isabel and not only regained all the land, castles and titles that Richard de Clare should have inherited, but added greatly to them?&lt;ref name="castlewales.com"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Richard de Clare was the statesman, whereas Raymond was the soldier, of the conquest. He is vividly described by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] as "His complexion was somewhat ruddy and his skin freckled; he had grey eyes, feminine features, a weak voice, and short neck. For the rest, he was tall in stature, and a man of great generosity and of courteous manner."&lt;ref name="CIB130"&gt;Alfred Webb, ''A compendium of Irish biography'' (Dublin: M.H. Gill &amp; Son, 1878), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; He was first interred in Dublin's [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] where an alleged [[effigy]] can be viewed.&lt;ref name="CIB130"/&gt; Richard de Clare's actual tomb-effigy was destroyed when the roof of the Cathedral collapsed in 1562. The one on display dates from around the 15th century, bears the coat of arms of an unknown knight,&lt;ref&gt;James Graves, ‘Armorial bearings of Strongbow’, Gentleman’s magazine and historical review, ccxvi, 1 (March 1864), 362–3; 'On the arms of Richard de Clare’, Gentleman’s magazine and historical review, ccxviii, 1 (April 1865), 403–8; ccxvix, 2 (July 1865), 3–11; (August 1865), 207–8;(November 1865), 551–63 gives the best summary. Stuart Kinsella summarised the most recent work in a lecture to the conference on 'Monuments and Monumentality in Later Medieval
and Early Modern Europe' in Stirling University in August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and is the effigy of another local knight. Richard de Clare was buried in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin]] within sight of the cross according to an eyewitness, Giraldus Cambrensis. There is little evidence to support the tradition that he was buried either in [[St Edan's Cathedral, Ferns]],&lt;ref&gt;John Finlayson, ''Inscriptions on the monuments, mural tablets &amp;c, Christ Church Cathedral'' (Dublin: Hodges, Foster, &amp; Figgis, 1878), p. 66 notes no more than a 'fearful malediction ... pronounced against him by a Bishop of Ferns' citing King's Church History, ii, 622 and Haverty's 'History of Ireland', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christ Church Cathedral, Waterford]] or [[Dominican priory, Kilkenny]]. References to 'de Clare' being buried in [[Gloucester cathedral]] refer to his father, while those to 'Strongbow' in Tintern abbey refer probably to Walter or Anselm Marshall, both of whom died in 1245.

Richard de Clare is an ancestor of the American [[Bush Family|Bush political family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/27/usa.angeliquechrisafis|title=Scion of traitors and warlords: why Bush is coy about his Irish links |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=13 July 2010 |location=London |first=Angelique |last=Chrisafis |date=2005-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Brierley was born in [[Wellington]] during 1937 to middle class parents.

Retrieved 16 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

===Early career===

Ron Brierley began his career as the publisher of a horse racing tip sheet. He followed this with an investment analysis newsletter "Stocks and Shares"  which he founded in 1956 at age 19.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deep Value: Why Activist Investors and other Contrarians Battle for control of Losing Corporations|last = Carlisle|first = Tobias|publisher = Wiley|year = 2014|isbn = 1118747968|location = USA|pages = Chapter 7 (Kindle Edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sought to identify undervalued special situations and suggest what could be done with the companies.

His first bid via R.A.Brierley Investments Ltd was for the Otago Farmers Co-Operative Association in July 1961, which had become attractive as a target due to its cheapness, its unusual legal structure and the company being moved to an unofficial NZX bourse due to failing to comply with exchange listing requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While Brierley's offer was rejected, the company was forced into a change in policy and the market price of the company leapt upwards.

Other targets of Sir Ron Brierley's activist investment style in the 1960s and 1970s included the Southern Cross Building Society, the Finance Corporation of New Zealand, Citizens and Graziers and the Southern Farmers Co-operative Ltd in Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of these companies shares similar traits in that they were largely family controlled, inefficient, with lazy balance sheets, complacent management and surplus assets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Brierley's view was that his holding company, Brierley Investments Ltd, was "a monitoring organisation that continually evaluated the performance of various companies and acted as a catalyst to promote the most effective ownership of a company."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Man behind the Corporate Legend|last = Van Dongen|first = Yvonne|publisher = Penguin Books (NZL)|year = 1990|isbn = 0670831247|location = New Zealand|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post BIL===
On 29 March 1990 Brierley was appointed chairman of investment holding company [[Guinness Mahon|Guinness Peat Group]] (GPG). As chairman Brierley publicly attacked and defeated the plan to merge the [[London Stock Exchange]] with [[Deutsche Börse]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exchange merger 'bad for investors'|first=Simon|last=English|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2000/08/11/cnlse11.xml|date=2001-03-21|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Sir Ron Brierley, through his new company, Mercantile Investments, launched a hostile takeover of Australian shipping company Richfield International.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brierley's vehicle targets shipping firm|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/75508649/corporate-investor-ron-brierleys-new-vehicle-targets-shipping-firm-richfield|website = Stuff|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A row of heated drums dry out the paper, which enters the machine as wet pulp.&lt;br&gt;Large rolls are usually sliced into a number of thin rolls, which can feed continuous presses (e.g. newspapers) or be cut into separate sheets.]]
'''Sealy Fourdrinier''' (9 October 1773–1847) was an English paper-making entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Sealy_Fourdrinier|title=Sealy Fourdrinier|publisher= Grace's Guide|accessdate= 9 November 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

He was born the son of paper maker and stationer Henry Fourdrinier and grandson of the engraver [[Paul Fourdrinier]] (1698-1758), who were of Huguenot descent. His brother was [[Henry Fourdrinier]], his later partner in business.

Around the end of the 18th century Sealy and his brother were approached by John Gamble and Leger Didot, who were seeking financial support to develop an automatic paper making machine developed in Paris by [[Louis-Nicolas Robert]], an employee of Didot. In 1801–02 the Fourdriniers entrusted engineer [[Bryan Donkin]] (then working with [[John Hall (engineer)|John Hall]])&lt;ref name="JHOD"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Hall (of Dartford)|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/John_Hall_(of_Dartford)|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the development of Robert’s model into a prototype continuous paper-making machine. The world's first production machine was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]] in [[Apsley, Hertfordshire]] in 1803 and a second, much improved and larger machine installed the following year. By 1810 eighteen machines had been installed at various mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frogmoremill.com/explore-2/history/the-fourdriniers/|title=The Fourdriniers and the world’s first paper-making machine|publisher=Frogmore Paper Mill|accessdate= 9 November 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of developing and improving the machines was of the order of £60,000 and although the inventions were covered by various patents taken out by the Fourdrinier brothers, the costs of manufacture, installation and maintenance and the difficulty of collecting royalties forced the Sealy brothers to declare themselves bankrupt in 1810.

The machines themselves, known as [[Fourdrinier machine]]s, were very successful and continued to be made in considerable numbers by Donkins. In 1837 a Parliamentary Select Committee acknowledged the importance of the Fourdriniers’ contribution to the paper industry and voted them £7000 compensation.

Sealy Fourdrinier died at Southwark in 1847. He had married Harriet Pownall at St Mary Wolnoth, London and had children James Sealy (1805-1870), Harriet (1806-1863), and Louisa Elizabeth (1813-1892). Louisa Elizabeth married the clergyman [[John Bathurst Deane]] &lt;ref&gt;"Marriages" in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' dated July 1834, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; and became the mother of thirteen children, including [[Mary Bathurst Deane]]. Another of her daughters, Eleanor Deane (1861–1941), married Henry Ernest Wodehouse and was the mother of the writer [[P. G. Wodehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burke's Peerage]]'', volume 2 (2003), page 2,164&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shareholder Executive''' ('''ShEx''') was a body within the [[UK Government]] responsible for managing the government's financial interest in a range of [[government-owned corporation|state-owned businesses]] for commercial rather than political interests. It was part of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and staffed by civil servants, many of whom were corporate finance professionals with private sector experience. It was led by [[Mark Francis Russell|Mark Russell]] as Chief Executive at the time of its closure.

== Role ==
The Shareholder Executive managed a portfolio of businesses with a combined turnover of around £12&amp;nbsp;billion. The businesses varied and could be in the form of a [[limited company]], [[public limited company]], [[limited liability partnership]], [[statutory corporation]], [[trading fund]], [[executive agency]], [[non-departmental public body]] or [[non-ministerial government department]]. 

It advised the government on drafting parts of the [[Postal Services Act 2011]] and worked on the [[privatisation]] of [[Royal Mail]] and the possible [[mutual organisation|mutualisation]] of [[Post Office Ltd]]. It was also involved in establishing the [[UK Green Investment Bank]], the [[Public Data Group]] and the [[British Business Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/shareholderexecutive/about-us |title=About us |publisher= Shareholder Executive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not responsible for the government's shares in UK banks, which were managed by [[UK Financial Investments]] (UKFI), or the government's property holdings, which were managed by the [[Government Property Unit]] (GPU).

== History ==
The Shareholder Executive was originally established in September 2003 as part of the [[Cabinet Office]]. In 2004 it moved to the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI). 

In 2007 the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] published a report into the Shareholder Executive. This was broadly positive but had some misgivings about its location in the DTI.

Following the split of the DTI in 2007, ShEX moved to the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] (BERR) and then to its successor, the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS) in 2009.

The Shareholder Executive was originally involved in the government's [[nationalisation]] of [[Northern Rock]] and [[Bradford &amp; Bingley]] at the start of the banking crisis in 2008. It then began the process of splitting off Northern Rock's '[[bad bank]]' mortgage business to form [[Northern Rock (Asset Management)|Northern Rock]]. All bank shareholdings were transferred to [[UK Financial Investments]] in November 2008.

In 2011 the Government Property Unit was moved from the Shareholder Executive to the [[Cabinet Office]] as part of the new [[Efficiency and Reform Group]].

In 2015, the government announced that the Shareholder Executive would be transferred to [[HM Treasury]] and became subsidiary of [[UK Government Investments]], along with [[UK Financial Investments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/machinery-of-government-shareholder-executive-and-uk-financial-investments|title=Machinery of government: Shareholder Executive and UK Financial Investments – Press releases|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to occur with the end of the government fiscal year on 1 April 2016.

== Portfolio Unit ==
The Portfolio Unit contains businesses where the Shareholder Executive has a shareholding mandate, although the shares themselves are owned by government departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/shareholderexecutive/structure/portfolio-unit |title=Portfolio Unit |publisher= Shareholder Executive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role is either accountable to ministers directly ('executive'), working alongside shareholding teams within departments ('joint team') or advising department shareholder teams ('advisory'). Most businesses are wholly owned by the government, but some are part owned.

'''SEAF''' is an international investment management group that provides growth capital and business assistance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in emerging and transition markets underserved by traditional sources of capital.&lt;ref name="SEAF who we are"&gt;{{cite web|title=SEAF- Who we are|url=http://seaf.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=68&amp;lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Founded in 1989 as the private equity investment subsidiary of the international development organization CARE, Small Enterprise Assistance Funds ("SEAF") evolved in 1995 into an independent organization specializing in the sponsorship and management of investment funds targeting growth-oriented, emerging enterprises located in countries underserved by traditional sources of capital.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
SEAF has managed or is managing 36 Funds across more than 30 countries with over USD 1 billion in aggregate committed capital, of which over USD 600 million has been invested through over 400 investments in SMEs, with more than 300 completed exits (through December 31, 2017).  Investors in SEAF-sponsored funds represent a cross section of public and private institutions, including multilateral financial institutions, private foundations, pension funds, insurance companies, family offices, banks and other independent financial institutions.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

SEAF employs over 140 investment professionals worldwide within a network of 20+ regional offices.

== Impact on Development ==

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are often overlooked and therefore referred to as the "missing middle" in the developing world.  Recent data results, analysis and case highlights (reports can be found below in the "Publications" section) demonstrate how SMEs can generate employment opportunities in their local communities, serve as links to regional and international markets for smaller local suppliers, and address market deficiencies and customer needs that would otherwise go unaddressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seaf.com/Economic_Impact_Documents/From%20Poverty%20to%20Prosperity.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229004701/http://seaf.com/Economic_Impact_Documents/From%20Poverty%20to%20Prosperity.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }} SEAF Report on Development Impact&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2008/09_development_gibson.aspx Brookings Report on SMEs&lt;/ref&gt;

== SEAF and CEED ==

In 2006, the SEAF family grew larger with the creation of '''Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED)''', a legacy institution of [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and SEAF, born out of USAID grant funding in SME equity investments made by SEAF throughout the Balkans, and EBRD in Slovenia. CEED centers provide business development training and technical assistance to entrepreneurs in emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceed-global.org/web/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028114724/http://www.ceed-global.org/web/default.aspx |archivedate=2009-10-28 |df= }} CEED Homepage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usaid.gov/locations/europe_eurasia/press/success/2006-03-22.html USAID CEED Article&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16888">'''Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością'''  (literally: ''Limited liability company''), abbreviated '''Sp. z o.o.''', is the legal title of a [[private limited company]] in [[Poland]].

==Formation of a Sp. z o.o.==

===Overview===
The necessary steps for establishing a Sp. z o.o. (spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością)  are determined by Article 163 KSH ([[Kodeks spółek handlowych]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 163 Nr. 1; Rodzynkiewicz: Kodeks spółek handlowych: Komentarz, S. 271-273; Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  It first requires the notarization of the articles of incorporation. It must take place in [[Poland]]. The conclusion of the [[articles of incorporation]] creates a legal capacity subject, the company prior registration.

The second step requires the full payment of the [[share capital]] as codified by the articles of incorporation. Where required the payment includes the agreed surplus over the nominal value of the company share.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 7; Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 163 Nr. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The share capital may be covered by cash or contribution in kind. Inalienable rights, e.g. work or services cannot place as a deposit in a Sp. z o.o.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 7; Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 14 Nr. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third step is the appointment of the board and possibly other organs of the Sp. z o.o.. The [[Board of Directors]] or the first board members can already be appointed at formation. Once all deposits are paid in full, the board may register for entry into the [[business register]]. The application is inter alia accompanied by a statement of all board members that the deposits were placed to cover the common stock in full by all [[shareholder]]s in the company. The registration of the company in the business register takes about two to four weeks. By registering the company in the business register, the company becomes a [[legal entity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 9; Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 12 Nr. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  After registration in the business register, the Board of Directors has to request the so-called REGON number at the statistics agency. This is issued within one to two days. Subsequently the Board of Directors has to register the company at the company's financial authorities and obtain the so-called "NIP"-Number (Taxpayer Identification Number) and the VAT number.

The granting of the NIP requires the submission of a lease or other proof that the company has any accommodation, also a bank account contract is required. For these reasons it is recommended that already with formation the Board of Directors is appointed. In this way, in the start-up phase before registration in the business register the company is already able to open a bank account and sign a lease agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bogen/ Siekierzyński (2006): Länderbericht Polen, S. 3 Rn. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content of the articles of incorporation===
The minimum content to be regulated the articles of incorporation determines Article 157 KSH. The articles of incorporation must contain information about the name of the company, place of business, the subject of the activity, the amount of registered capital, an indication of whether a shareholder is allowed to take over one or more company shares, the number and the nominal value of the company shares of each of the shareholders are taken and the duration of the company, if it is determined.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 157 Nr. 1; Rodzynkiewicz: Kodeks spółek handlowych: Komentarz, S. 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond the minimum content the shareholders are free to regulate their relationship to each other or to the company more extensive.

===Costs of formation===
Notable costs are first of all the notary fees, which are calculated in dependence to the share capital. If the share capital amounts e.g. 8000 [[zloty]] (about 2,000 [[EUR]]), the maximum amount to pay is 100 zloty plus 3% on the difference between share capital and 3000 zloty, consequently 3% of 5000 zloty. In result of this the total costs for the notary would be 250 zloty (about 62 EUR). In addition the [[value added tax]] ([[VAT]]) at the legal rate from the current 23% has to be added.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. PAlilZ/ JP Weber (2009): Ratgeber für Investoren – Polen: Hinweise zur Führung der Geschäftstätigkeit, S. 106 und 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, costs incur associated with registering the company in the business register and the publication in for this responsible "monitor Gospodarczy i Sądowy" in the amount of approximately 1500 zloty (about 370 EUR). Finally, within 14 days after formation of the articles of incorporation, the so-called tax on civil law transactions (PCC) is to pay. This is 0.5% of the share capital.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bogen/ Siekierzyński (2006): Länderbericht Polen, S. 6 Rn. 15; Ustawa podatku od czynności cywilnoprawnych, Dz.U. Nr. 86 Pos. 959.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial condition of the Sp. z o.o.==

===Capital raising and capital maintenance===
The share capital amounts to at least 5,000 zloty (about 1,230 EUR). The shares can either be of equal or unequal height, depending on the articles of incorporation. If a shareholder can have more than one share, the shares must be equal and indivisible. The minimum nominal value of a share amounts to 50 zloty (approx. €12.5).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 154 Nr. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish legislator has various instruments to ensure the protection of creditors.

The share capital must be maintained throughout the life of the company. It may be reduced only in the manner allowed by law, e.g. through a capital reduction. The ban also applies to the hidden distribution of profits. A payment from the required share capital covering the company's assets is not possible for the shareholders under any title.&lt;ref&gt;YCf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 189 Nr. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shareholders are also prohibited from referring to or from the assets contributed their rightful share interest. Claims of the shareholder from a granted loan of the Sp. z o.o. applies as a contribution to the company if the loan was granted within two years before the insolvency of the Sp. z o.o.. In addition, Article 14 § 4 KSH contains a setoff of maturing share payments.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The access rights of the shareholders at the company's assets are generally restricted to the distribution of certain portion of the profits.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change in the share capital amount===
The [[capital increase]] is governed by Articles 255 ff. KSH. Basically, the increase in share capital demanded the change of the articles of incorporation. This requires a notarized resolution of the shareholders' meeting and the entry into the business register. Without changing the articles of incorporation, the capital increase can be carried out only if this is expressly permitted by the articles of incorporation. The exact height to which the share capital can be raised and the exact date to which the increase take place is also a requirement have to be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital increase is carried out either by increasing the nominal value of existing shares or by issuing new shares (ordinary capital increase). In case of the ordinary capital increase the company's assets is increased by the new deposits, which is provided from the old or new shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, the existing shareholders are entitled to acquire the new shares. The take-over declaration needs to be notarized. In the case of the nominal capital increase the share capital will be increased by retained earnings or capital reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[capital reduction]] of share capital requires changing the articles of incorporation in general as well. The shareholders may decide either the recovery of shares or the reduction of the share value. The reduction decision has to determine the amount of the share capital reduction and the way by which the capital should be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum share capital and the minimum nominal value of shares may not be affected by the reduction. The reduction of the share capital needs to declare immediately to the creditors of the company with the request to object within three months, if they do not agree with the reduction. Creditors, which contradict the deadline, are generally to be satisfied by the company or have to obtain an appropriate security for their claim.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each corporate action becomes effective upon its entry into the business register, and thus has a constitutive effect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Schnell/ Brockhuis (2001): Polen: Gesetzbuch der Handelsgesellschaften - Teil 4: GmbH. WIRO 2001, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional organ of the Sp. z o.o.==

===The Board of Directors===
The board consists of one or more individuals. To the board may be appointed both shareholders and third parties. Board members may be foreigners or persons resident abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bogen/ Siekierzyński (2006): Länderbericht Polen, S. 26 Rn. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Board are appointed and dismissed by resolution of the shareholders, unless the articles of incorporation provides otherwise, such as the appointment by the [[Supervisory Board]].

Board members are generally appointed for one year. An excess of this one-year term of office may also be agreed. The term of office generally terminates with the date of holding of the shareholders’ meeting, which approved the financial statements for the last full financial year of the exercise of Executive Function. Board members are also free to withdraw from its role as manager.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 202 Nr. 5; Rodzynkiewicz: Kodeks spółek handlowych: Komentarz, S. 364-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless otherwise agreed in the articles of incorporation, a board member can be dismissed at any time. However, the claims arising from the employment relationship persist.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 203 Nr. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board conducts the business of the Sp. z o.o. and represents it externally. The legal representative of a board member cannot be confined in an external legal effect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 204 Nr. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The articles of incorporation certainly may determine the way of representation.

The legal base case therefore regulates by a multi-person board that for issuing statements on behalf of the Sp. z o.o. the interaction of two board members or one board member along with a registered manager is required.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 205 Nr. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other bodies at a glance===
The Supervisory Board performs the constant, the [[Auditing Committee]] the periodic supervision over the [[affairs]] of the Company. The appointment of a Supervisory Board or Audit Commission at a Sp. z oo, in which the capital stock amounts more than 500,000 zloty (approx. 125.000 €) and also more than 25 existing shareholders, is mandatory. Otherwise the shareholders are responsible for an agreement in the articles of incorporation on the appointment of a supervisory board or audit commission. Both organs consist of at least three members who are appointed or dismissed by shareholders' resolution. The duties and responsibilities of those supervisory organs include the [[annual audit]] and the examination of the [[annual report]] of the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there is to mention the shareholders meeting. The shareholders' meeting is equipped with extensive skills and at the same time the supreme decision-making body of the Sp. z o.o.. By operation of law, the decisions on important matters are reserved to the shareholders' meeting. The competencies include the examination and approval of the annual report of the Board of Directors, the statement of profit and loss, the approval of the Board of Directors, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Commission, any decision on repayment of additional contributions, the sale or [[lease out]] of a company and the appointment of limited real rights on it.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights and obligations of shareholders==
The main duties of the shareholders include the provision of full deposit, the compensation of excessive determined contributions in kind and the reimbursement of unjustified payments (Art. 175, 198 KSH). Under the special relation of the articles of incorporation may accrue the following duties: acquisition of administrative or supervisory duties, the obligation to recurring [[contributions in kind]] (Art. 176 KSH) or to pay [[further margins]] (Article 177 KSH).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the property rights primarily belongs the right to receive [[dividends]] (Art. 192 KSH), the subscription rights (Article 258 KSH), the participation of the net profits (Art. 191 ff KSH) and the settlement proceeds (Article 286 KSH), a claim for contributions in kind (Art. 176 KSH) and the repayment of the deposit for capital reduction and cancellation of the share and the right for repayment of unused further margins (Article 179 KSH).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative rights include especially the participation of [[corporate resolution]]s (Art. 227 ff KSH), the appeal of such resolutions (Article 250 KSH), minority protection, the action for [[Dissolution (law)|dissolution]] of the Company and to the expulsion of shareholders (Article 271 No. 1, 266 § 1 KSH) and the individual right to obtain information and control of each shareholder (Art. 212 KSH, which can only be restricted or excluded if the appointment of a supervisory body is provided, Article 213 § 3 KSH).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deviation from the equality in principle envisaged in terms of rights and duties of all shareholders may be prerogatives recognized under the special relation of the articles of incorporation. In particular, those prerogatives may affect the right to vote (more than three votes per share) and the right to dividend (maximum of 150% of the dividend to be paid to a non-privileged share).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquidation and Insolvency==
The dissolution of a Sp. z o.o and the associated deletion in the business register takes place after carrying out the liquidation. Further steps are governed by Article 274 ff. KSH.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Causes for dissolution may result from the law as well as the articles of incorporation. Notable examples: Resolution of the shareholders to dissolve the company or to transfer the registered office abroad, the announcement of the insolvency of the company as well as a verdict of a court.

The legal basis of the insolvency of a Sp. z o.o. regulates the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Law of 2003. The bankruptcy must be applied if the company is illiquid, means the company is unable pay their liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem''' (born 1955 in Dubai,UAE) is the Group Chairman and CEO  of DP World. Bin Sulayem is currently involved in [[Seven Tides]] International, a diversified Real Estate Investment and Development Company in [[Dubai]] UAE. On 30 May 2007 Bin Sulayem became the Chairman of [[DP World]].

==Family background==
The Sulayem family has been one Dubai's most prominent business and political families since at least the early 20th century. Ahmed bin Sulayem's father was a key advisor to Dubai's ruling Maktoum family.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125605837214896881   ''Dubai Inc. is in need of change at the top''], WSJ, Andrew Critchlow, October 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A son of his, [[Ahmed bin Sulayem]], is also prominent in business.

==Business career==
Bin Sulayem's first job after graduating from college in the late 1970s was as a customs inspector at Dubai's then sleepy port. He told Fortune Magazine in 2008 that his future career was set when a man mistakenly came into his office one day and in the course of chatting suggested that Dubai could serve as an entrepot for the tea trade if it created a tax-free zone at the port. That chance meeting encouraged him to travel the world studying tax-free trading zones. When he returned home he approached Dubai's future ruler and family friend Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] with a proposal to build a free trade zone at the port. "If you really believe in it, you go run it." Bin Sulayem said Sheikh Mohammed told him. "I was 30."&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/02/20/news/international/Dubai_djibouti.fortune/index.htm   ''Searching for the next Dubai''], Fortune Magazine hosted at CNN.com, February 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

That conversation led to Bin Sulayem serving as the first chairman of the Dubai government's tax-free [[Jebel Ali Free Zone]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-UCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sultan%20Ahmed%20bin%20Sulayem&amp;lr=&amp;cd=15#v=onepage&amp;q=Sultan%20Ahmed%20bin%20Sulayem&amp;f=false|title=New York Magazine|first=New York Media|last=LLC|date=21 September 1987|publisher=New York Media, LLC|accessdate=28 July 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was founded in 1985.

Since the 1980s, Bin Sulayem has been one of the most prominent businessmen in Dubai, with a string of government-linked ventures. In addition to chairing Dubai World he helped found [[Nakheel]], one of the UAE's largest property developers and [[Istithmar]], a major investment holding company in [[Dubai]]. Both companies are Dubai World subsidiaries. 

He also served on the board of the [[Investment Corporation of Dubai]], the emirate's [[sovereign wealth fund]], until November, 2009, when Bin Sulayem was removed from that post in the wake of the debt crisis that struck Dubai that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091220/BUSINESS/712209917/1005/business   ''Dubai holding up to scrutiny''], The National, Dubai, December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2009 and early 2010, Dubai was struggling to pay $80 billion in debt, most of it linked to Dubai World and its subsidiaries.

The Wall Street Journal's influential ''Heard on the Street'' column said in October 2009 that Dubai World "has just been radically restructured after running up almost $60 billion of liabilities on ill-judged acquisitions like struggling Madison Avenue retailer Barneys and the Queen Elizabeth II liner, which has since largely languished in a Dubai dry dock" and that "surprisingly, senior management remains in place, including Sultan bin Sulayem, the chairman who masterminded the expansion.""&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt; Sulayem was finally removed from his post in December, 2010 and was replaced by [[Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], a member of the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/new-chairman-for-dubai-world] New Chairman for Dubai World, The National, Dec. 13 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and awards==
He received a B.S. in economics from [[Temple University]] of Philadelphia, the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greendubaiworldforum.org/speakers.html   Dubai World corporate bio on Sulayem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108080458/http://www.greendubaiworldforum.org/speakers.html |date=2008-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

He was awarded an [[Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Middlesex University|Middlesex University in Dubai]]&lt;ref name="DubaiGraduation"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Middlesex University Dubai awards its first honorary doctorate to His Excellency Sultan Bin Sulayem|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/pressoffice/pressreleases/2008/Press%20releases%202008/November%202008/Dubai%20Graduation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Washington Boulevard''' is an east-west [[arterial road]] in [[Los Angeles County, California]] spanning a total of (27.4 miles - 44&amp;nbsp;km).  It starts by the [[Pacific Ocean]] just west of Pacific Avenue in Marina del Rey, and ends far to the east in the city of [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], on [[Whittier Boulevard]]. It is south of [[Venice Boulevard]] for most of its length. At Wade Street, Washington Place is formed adjacent and parallel and lasts until just east of [[Sepulveda Boulevard]], where it merges back into Washington Boulevard. Washington merges into Culver Boulevard briefly, but forms back into its own street at Canfield Avenue.

Washington Boulevard, which is four lanes, primarily passes through locations in the mid southern portion of Los Angeles County. The communities to the west include affluent areas such as [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]] and [[Ladera Heights, California|Ladera Heights]]. Further east it passes between [[Crestview, Los Angeles|Crestview]] and [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] and through [[Mid-City, Los Angeles|Mid City]], [[Arlington Heights, Los Angeles|Arlington Heights]], [[Pico-Union, Los Angeles|Pico Union]], [[Commerce, California|City of Commerce]], [[Montebello, California|Montebello]], [[Pico Rivera, California|Pico Rivera]], [[Los Nietos, California|Los Nietos]] and [[Whittier, California|Whittier]]. Washington Boulevard is the dividing line between the neighborhood [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice]] in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]].

==History==
In 1905, when the road was known as Washington Street, it boasted the headquarters of the local [[Driving (horse)|horse driving club]], for a mile west of [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]]. "The road is not of the best," reported the ''Los Angeles Times,'' "and automobiles are usurping it . . . but it is the nearest approach to a [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] the reinsmen have, and they therefore make the most of it." Mayor [[Owen McAleer]] "has set aside that stretch of the highway to those drivers who delight in vying with each other off the [[racetrack]], and policemen have been given to understand that some latitude is to be allowed horsemen there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/164378228/91F5BE5445A4486CPQ/4?accountid=6749 "Fast Horses His Delight," ''Los Angeles Times,'' October 1, 1905, page III-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Washington Boulevard provides bus service between Venice Beach and West LA Transit Center by [[Culver City Transit]] line 1, between West LA Transit Center and Downtown by [[Metro Local]] line 35, and east of Downtown by [[Montebello Transit]] line 50. A portion of the [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Blue line]] runs along Washington Boulevard (serving the [[Grand (LACMTA station)|Grand/LATTC]], [[San Pedro (LACMTA station)|San Pedro]] and [[Washington (LACMTA station)|Washington]] stations), from Flower Street to Long Beach Avenue, while the [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]] serves [[Culver City (Los Angeles Metro station)|a rail station]] near the intersection with National Boulevard.

==Major intersections==
The entire route is in [[Los Angeles County]]. There are no postmiles because the street is maintained by local jurisdictions and not [[Caltrans]].
