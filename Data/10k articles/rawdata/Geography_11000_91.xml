'''Antoni Bolesław Dobrowolski''' (6 June 1872, in [[Dworszowice Kościelne]] – 27 April 1954, in [[Warsaw]]), was a  [[Poland|Polish]] [[geophysics|geophysicist]], [[meteorology|meteorologist]] and explorer.

== Early life ==
Dobrowolski was born into an indigent family and supported himself from the age of 12 by teaching younger students while a high school student in Warsaw. His involvement in seeking Polish independence led to a conviction to three years imprisonment in the Caucasus, but after two years he escaped and started studying in Switzerland and Belgium.&lt;ref name="hgss"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.hist-geo-space-sci.net/2/75/2011/ | title=A. B. Dobrowolski – the first cryospheric scientist – and the subsequent development of cryospheric science |author1=Barry, R.G. |author2=Jania, J. |author3=Birkenmajer, K. | journal=History of Geo- and Space Sciences |date=April 2011 | volume=2 | pages=75–79 | doi=10.5194/hgss-2-75-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Belgian Antarctic Expedition ==
While still a student in biology, physics and chemistry at the [[University of Liège]] he took part in the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] (1897-1899) as assistant meteorologist. [[Henryk Arctowski]], who was in charge of physical observations, was initially unsuccessfully in convincing expedition commander [[Adrien de Gerlache]] to take him on, but when the [[RV Belgica (1884)|Belgica]] had to return to [[Ostend]] for repairs and the ship's doctor and a sailor quit, he was contracted as a sailor.

However, his substantial scientific contributions prompted de Gerlache to formally promote him in March 1898. Arctowski and Dobrowolski were the first to conduct year-round meteorological and hydrographical observations off Antarctica. In addition he studied ice crystallography and light phenomena in ice clouds. These data enabled him to write a monumental treatise on the crystallography of ice and snow.

After his return from the Antarctic he obtained a scholarship in Belgium to study his results and collaborated with [[Georges Lecointe (explorer)|Georges Lecointe]] at the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]].&lt;ref name="hgss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contributions"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.polish.polar.pan.pl/ppr19/1998-1-2_015-030.pdf | title=Contribution of H. Arctowski and A. B. Dobrowolski to the Antarctic Expedition of Belgica (1897-1899) | author=Machowski, Jacek | journal=Polish Polar Research | year=1998 | volume=19 | issue=1–2 | pages=15–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "pioneers"&gt;{{cite book | title=Antarctic Pioneers.

== Later career ==
In 1907 [[Nicholas II of Russia]] declared amnesty for political refugees, enabling Dobrowolski to return to Warsaw. Until 1914, he worked as a schoolteacher. During the First World War he lived in Sweden, where he studied ice and snow formation. After the war he returned to Poland, where he finished his treatise on the crystallography of ice and snow, ''Natural History of Ice'' (''{{lang|pl|Historia naturalna lodu}}''). The concept of the [[cryosphere]] can be traced back to this monogram. He also published works on pedagogy and research ethics, while teaching pedagogy at the Polish Free University in Warsaw, and was deeply involved in the organization of education in newly independent Poland. In 1924 he was appointed deputy director, and later director, of the Polish Meteorological Institute in Warsaw.&lt;ref name = "hgss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.polish.polar.pan.pl/ppr19/1998-1-2_011-013.pdf | title=Antoni Bolesław Dobrowolski (6 June 1872-27 April 1954) | author=Machowski, Jacek | journal=Polish Polar Research | year=1998 | volume=19 | issue=1–2 | pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded several observatories and the Society of Geophysicists in Warsaw, and actively promoted polar research in Poland. During the [[International Polar Year#History|second Polar Year]] (1932-1933) he provided practical help and advice to the Polish expedition that overwintered on [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]]. He headed the organizing committee of the 1934 Polish expedition to [[Spitsbergen]], and was involved with the 1938 Polish Expedition to [[Oscar II Land]]. After the Second World War he pushed for further Polish scientific involvement in Polar research. He died in 1954, without seeing the implementation of his ideas in the Polish participation in the [[International Geophysical Year]]. His fellow Polish explorers and scientists regarded him as a "father figure", and he naturally became a center of Polar knowledge.&lt;ref name = "action"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.polish.polar.pan.pl/ppr19/1998-1-2_031-036.pdf | title=Polar Action of Antoni Bolesław Dobrowolski in the interwar period | author=Popiołek, Joanna | journal=Polish Polar Research | year=1998 | volume=19 | issue=1–2 | pages=31–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.polish.polar.pan.pl/ppr19/1998-1-2_004-006.pdf | title=Centennial of participation of H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9759">The '''Armada de Molucca''' was the name of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] fleet led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|expedition]] to sail to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] from Europe and the first world [[circumnavigation]]. The fleet sailed from Spain in 1519 across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and then [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans. After Magellan's death in the [[Philippines]] in 1521, [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]] took command of the fleet which arrived in the Spice Islands a few months later, and led the expedition back to Spain across the [[Indian Ocean]] where they arrived in 1522.

The fleet, provided by King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], included five ships: the [[Trinidad (ship)|''Trinidad'']] (110 tons, crew 55) under Magellan's command, the ''[[San Antonio (spanish ship)|San Antonio]]'' (120 tons; crew 60) commanded by [[Juan de Cartageña]], the ''[[Concepcion (ship)|Concepcion]]'' (90 tons, crew 45) commanded by [[Gaspar de Quesada]], the ''[[Santiago (spanish ship)|Santiago]]'' (75 tons, crew 32) commanded by [[João Serrão|Juan Rodriguez Serrano]] and the ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'' (85 tons, crew 43) commanded by [[Luiz Mendoza]], which carried supplies and provisions. The ''Santiago'' was a [[caravel]], while the others were rated as [[carrack]]s (Spanish "carraca" or "nao"; Portuguese "[[Nau (ship)|nau]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergreen|first=Laurence|title=Over the Edge of the World|year=2003|publisher=HaperCollins Publishers Inc.|location=10 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five ships departed from Seville on 10 August 1519 and left Spain on 20 September 1519. They traversed the Atlantic, then rounded the southern tip of South America through the [[Strait of Magellan]], and then sailed the Pacific Ocean, stopping over in [[Guam]] before arriving in the [[Philippines]] in April 1521 and finally the Spice Islands on 6 November 1521. It took them over two years to reach the Moluccas since they departed from Spain, and with only two of the original ships remaining (''Trinidad'' and ''Victoria''). On 6 September 1522, the ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, led by Juan Sebastian Elcano, one of the two ships to survive the voyage, and the only one to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the world.&lt;ref name=murphy&gt;{{cite book|first1=Patrick J. |last1=Murphy |first2=Ray W. |last2=Coye |title=Mutiny and Its Bounty: Leadership Lessons from the Age of Discovery |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/Book.asp?isbn=9780300170283 |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |ISBN=9780300170283 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627113247/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/Book.asp?isbn=9780300170283 |archivedate=2015-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''San Antonio'' deserted the fleet somewhere during the crossing of the strait of Magellan, and returned to Spain on November 20, 1520.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

==The voyage==
{{See also|Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation}}

===Construction and provisions===

The expedition, funded largely by the Spanish Crown, provided both 5 ships and supplies for two years of travel. The fleet was to be called Armada de Molucca, after the Indonesian name for the Spice Islands. The ships were mostly black, due to the tar covering most of their surface. Though [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles V]] was supposed to pay for the fleet he was deeply in debt, and he turned to the [[Fugger|House of Fugger]]. 
The official accounting of the expedition put the cost at 8,751,125 [[maravedi]]s, including the ships, provisions, and salaries.
Food was a hugely important part of the provisioning. It cost 1,252,909 maravedis, almost as much as the cost of the ships. Four-fifths of the food on the ship consisted of just two items – [[wine]] and [[hardtack]].

The fleet also carried flour and salted meat. Some of the ships' meat came in the form of livestock; the ship carried seven cows and three pigs. Cheese, almonds, mustard, and figs were also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vial|first=Ignacio Fernandez|title=La Primera Vuelta al Mundo: La Nao Victoria|year=2001|publisher=Munoz Moya Editores|location=Servilla}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{lang|es|italics=no|Carne de Membrillo}}, made from [[quince]], was a delicacy enjoyed by captains that unknowingly aided in the prevention of [[scurvy]].

===Crossing the Atlantic===

On 10 August 1519, the five ships under Magellan's command – ''Trinidad'', ''San Antonio'', ''Concepción'', ''Santiago'' and ''Victoria'' – left [[Seville]] and descended the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir River]] to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], at the mouth of the river. There they remained more than five weeks. Finally they set sail on 20 September 1519 and left Spain. The fleet made its way down the coast of Africa for a few weeks, but when storms began to batter the ships the Armada set out for Rio.{{clarify|reason=Which Rio? Surely not Rio de Janeiro, which wasn't founded until 1565, more than 40 years later|date=October 2018}} On 29 November 1519 they arrived at [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape Saint Augustine]]. They continued their search for Rio before finally arriving December 13. The next leg of their journey, though a short distance compared to the journey they would eventually complete, was fraught with storms and bad luck, and took almost a year to complete. They also lost their first ship, ''Santiago'', to a storm, though the entire crew survived.

===Strait of Magellan===

[[File:Strait of Magellan.jpeg|thumb|left|The [[Strait of Magellan]] cuts through the southern tip of South America connecting the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean.]]

At 52°S latitude on 21 October 1520, the fleet reached [[Cape Virgenes]] and concluded they had found the passage, because the waters were [[brine]] and deep inland. Four ships began an arduous trip through the {{convert|373|mi|km|0|sing=on}} long passage that Magellan called the {{lang|es|Estrecho (Canal) de Todos los Santos}} ("All Saints' Channel"), because the fleet travelled through it on 1 November or [[All Saints' Day]]. The strait is now named the [[Strait of Magellan]]. During the dangerous navigation of the strait they lost their second ship, ''San Antonio'', but this time to mutiny. They continued on through the strait, and emerged into the Pacific Ocean on November 28.

===Pacific and Spice Islands===

Heading northwest, the crew reached the equator on 13 February 1521. On 6 March they reached the [[Marianas]] and [[Guam]]. Magellan called Guam the {{lang|es|Isla de las Velas}} ("Island of Sails") because they saw a lot of sailboats. They renamed it to {{lang|es|Isla de los Ladrones}} (Island of Thieves) because many of ''Trinidad''{{'s}} small boats were stolen there. On 17 March Magellan reached the island of [[Homonhon]] in the [[Philippines]], with 150 crew left. Members of his expedition became the first Spaniards to reach the Philippine archipelago, but they were not the [[First Europeans in the Philippines|first Europeans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suárez|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7ZMAbv_jAC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 138]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took over half a year of wandering the Philippines before the {{lang|es|italics=no|Armada de Molucca}} finally found the spice Islands. During this time they lost their third ship, ''Concepción'', which they burned due to the lack of men left to sail it. On 6 November 1521 they arrived.

===Return to Spain===
The two remaining ships, laden with valuable spices, attempted to return to Spain by sailing westwards. However, as they left the Spice Islands, the ''Trinidad'' began to take on water. The crew tried to discover and repair the leak, but failed. They concluded that ''Trinidad'' would need to spend considerable time being overhauled, but the small ''Victoria'' was not large enough to accommodate all the surviving crew. As a result, ''Victoria'' with some of the crew sailed west for Spain. Several weeks later, ''Trinidad'' departed and attempted to return to Spain via the Pacific route. This attempt failed. ''Trinidad'' was captured by the Portuguese, and was eventually wrecked in a storm while at anchor under Portuguese control.

''Victoria'' set sail via the Indian Ocean route home on 21 December, commanded by Juan Sebastián Elcano. By 6 May the ''Victoria'' rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], with only rice for rations. Twenty crewmen died of starvation before Elcano put into [[Cape Verde]], a Portuguese holding, where he abandoned 13 more crew on 9 July in fear of losing his cargo of 26 [[ton]]s of spices (cloves and [[cinnamon]]).

On 6 September 1522, Elcano and the remaining crew of Magellan's voyage arrived in Spain aboard the last ship in the fleet, ''Victoria'', almost exactly three years after they departed. Magellan had not intended to circumnavigate the world, only to find a secure way through which the Spanish ships could navigate to the Spice Islands; it was Elcano who, after Magellan's death, decided to push westward, thereby completing the first voyage around the entire Earth.

'''Bonded Fibre Matrix''' (BFM) [[mulch]] is a unique class of [[hydroseeding]] erosion control product.

The matrix is a continuous layer of elongated fibre strands held together by a water-resistant [[Binder (material)|bonding agent]]. It keeps raindrops from hitting the soil because it has no holes larger than one millimetre. It allows no gaps between the product and the soil. It has a high [[Field capacity|water-holding capacity]]. It will not form a water-insensitive crust that can inhibit plant growth. It [[Biodegradation|biodegrades]] into materials that help plant growth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">The '''Bosawás Biosphere Reserve''' in the northern part of state [[Jinotega]] (border with [[Honduras]]), [[Nicaragua]] is a hilly tropical forest designated in 1997 as a [[UNESCO]] [[biosphere reserve]]. At approximately 20,000&amp;nbsp;km² (2 million hectares) in size, the reserve (i.e. nucleus plus buffer zone) comprises about 15% of the nation's total land area making it the second largest rainforest in the [[Western Hemisphere]], after the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1718459.htm Science Show - 19 August 2006 - Bosawas Bioreserve Nicaragua&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bosawás is largely unexplored, and is extremely rich in [[biodiversity]].

==History==
The Bosawás Biosphere Reserve evolved from the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Sandinista revolution]]. The subsequent Chamorro government set aside three large reserves, Bosawás being the largest, with its nucleus comprising approximately 7% of Nicaragua's total land area (the rest constitutes the reserve's buffer zone).  After the creation of Bosawás it was considered a violation of right of the region's constitutional guaranteed territorial [[autonomy]], of which the Sandinista government granted two autonomous regions of the Caribbean coast for governance purpose.&lt;ref name="BR"&gt;{{cite book |author=McGinnis, Michael D. |title=Bioregionalism |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1999 |pages=176–177 |isbn=0-415-15444-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosawás overlaps the homelands of two of Nicaragua's indigenous peoples, the [[Sumo (people)|Sumos]] and the [[Miskito people|Miskito]], in an area which is rich in natural resources, most notably [[timber]] and [[gold]].&lt;ref name="BR"/&gt; About 130,000 inhabitants practice [[subsistence farming]] within the boundaries, about 35,000 of them indigenous Miskito and Sumo people.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from three natural features:  the [[Bocay River]], [[Mount Saslaya]] and the [[Waspuk River]].  It includes all of Nicaragua's [[Saslaya National Park]]. The [[Cordillera Isabella]] cross the reserve area, and the [[Coco River]] (Río Coco) forms the northern border, the political border with [[Honduras]].

==Flora and fauna==
About an estimated of 10,000&amp;nbsp;km² of forest occur in Bosawas.

Within Bosawás live an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 [[insect]] species; the number is believed to be higher, however a closer estimate is not possible due to the area being relatively unexplored. The [[botanical]] diversity of Bosawás is very high, with [[vascular plant]]s considered to be in the thousands. Bosawás also has rich [[taxa]] of [[invertebrate]] and [[vertebrate]] organisms. [[Quetzal]]s and [[Macaw|Guacamaya]]s are present in significant numbers, along with the largest and most powerful eagle found in the [[Americas]], the Harpy Eagle (''[[Harpia harpyja]]''). These, however, are just a few of 700 [[List of birds of Nicaragua|bird species]] found in the reserve and all over Nicaragua. [[Cougar|Pumas]] and [[Jaguar]]s, considered powerful consumers of the nutritional chain, are present in the reserve, and [[Tapir]]s (''[[Tapirus bairdii]]'') are their favorite prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| title=Bosawas: Flora y Fauna| date=| publisher=| url=http://www.tmx.com.ni/~bosawas/florafauna.htm| work=| pages=| accessdate=2007-06-12| language=Spanish| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622191117/http://www.tmx.com.ni/~bosawas/florafauna.htm| archivedate=2007-06-22| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bure''' is a small area about {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip}} west of [[Asseb]], on the border between [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]], and claimed by both countries. Bure lies across the important [[Awash, Ethiopia|Awash]]-Asseb highway, which in the past has been an important trucking route.

Bure came under Eritrean control after several weeks of fighting in May–June 1998. Eritrea said that Ethiopia had started an offensive at Bure by dropping bombs on the front-lines on 14 February 1999. The fighting in the area continued through the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] (1998-2000), with each side claiming it had inflicted heavy casualties on the other, until they agreed to a ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/B/ORTBUR.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"] (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 2 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission determined in 2002 that Bure lay on the Ethiopian side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title =Chapter VI – The Sector Covered by the 1908 Treaty (Eastern Sector) |publisher =Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission |date =2002-04-13 |url =http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=604 |accessdate =2007-10-10 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100602001956/http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=604 |archivedate =2010-06-02 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia soured in November 2005, when 20 Ethiopian soldiers occupied a portion of the area for several days.

::{{For|the western North American ecoregion|Mixed coniferous forest}}
[[File:CowellFerns.JPG|thumb|California mixed evergreen forest in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].]]
'''California mixed evergreen forest''' is an [[ecoregion]] of the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[biome]]. It is found in the mountain ranges of [[California]] and into southwestern [[Oregon]].

The [[Mixed coniferous forest|Mixed evergreen forest]] ecoregion is native to the Northern and Southern [[California Coast Ranges]] and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of central and [[northern California]]; the [[Transverse Ranges]] and [[Peninsular Ranges]] of [[southern California]]; and the southwestern [[Oregon Coast Range]]s.  

California mixed evergreen forests occur in [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregions]] of the [[California Floristic Province]], including in areas of the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] and its sub-ecoregions, [[Klamath Mountains (ecoregion)|Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains forests]], [[Northern California coastal forests]], and [[Sierra Nevada lower montane forest]]. The forests of each ecoregion have a somewhat different [[plant community]] composition.

==Klamath-Siskiyou mixed evergreen forest==
The mixed evergreen forests of the [[Klamath Mountains]]-[[Siskiyou Mountains]] occur above 300 meters (1000&amp;nbsp;ft) elevation, and are of four main types. '''Douglas-fir forests''' are found on gentle slopes, north-facing slopes, ridges with deep soil, and river terraces with deep sediments, usually underlain with [[sedimentary rock]]s. [[Coast Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' ssp. ''menziesii'') is the predominant tree, occupying up to 70% of the forest cover. Broadleaf evergreen trees are relatively few. Tree species of secondary importance are: 
*[[Sugar pine]] (''Pinus lambertiana''),
*[[Ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa''),
*[[White fir]] (''Abies concolor'').

On [[granite]] soils, a similar species composition predominates, but with more broadleaf evergreens, chiefly: 
*[[Tanoak]] (''Lithocarpus densiflora'') and
*[[Canyon live oak]] (''Quercus chrysolepis''), along with
*[[Giant chinquapin]] (''Chrysolepis chrysophylla'').

On steep, well drained slopes, canyon live oak is the dominant species, with coast Douglas-fir in a minor role.

On [[serpentine soil]]s, mixed evergreen forests are made up of:
:moister areas
*[[Lawson's cypress]] (also known as Port Orford cedar, ''Chamaecyparis lawsoniana'') and
*[[Western white pine]] (''Pinus monticola'')
:drier areas
*[[Incense cedar]] (''Calocedrus decurrens''),
*[[Jeffrey pine]] (''Pinus jeffreyi''),
*[[Knobcone pine]] (''Pinus attenuata'').

==California Coast Ranges mixed evergreen forest==
Mixed evergreen forests in the [[California Coast Ranges]] vary in species related to coastal (Outer Ranges) or inland (Inner Ranges) climate influences. Mountains in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] frequently support mixed evergreen forests. Generally the moister the forest habitat the greater the understory density.
:Those closer to the coast receiving adequate fog moisture and high rainfall generally will feature the following species:
*Coast Douglas-fir,
*[[Coast redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens'')
*[[Tanoak]], (''Notholithocarpus densiflorus'')
*[[Pacific madrone]] (''Arbutus menziesii''),
*[[California bay laurel]] (''Umbellularia californica''),
*[[Canyon live oak]] (''Quercus chrysolepis''),
*[[Interior live oak]] (''Quercus wislizenii''),
*[[Coast live oak]] (''Quercus agrifolia''),
*[[Quercus kelloggii|Black oak]] (''Q. kelloggii''),
*[[Oregon oak]] (''Q. garryana'')
*[[Big leaf maple]] (''Acer macrophyllum'').
:Further inland, on north facing slopes or protected canyons, these forests are drier and generally lack tanoak, Douglas fir, and coast redwood. Species typical of the drier neighboring [[California oak woodland|oak woodland]]s join the mix:
*[[Coulter pine]] (''Pinus coulteri'') or
*[[Gray pine]] (''Pinus sabiniana'')

Common wildlife include [[Steller's jay]], [[chestnut-backed chickadee]], [[western gray squirrel]], [[raccoon]] and many others. These forests are more diverse in animal life than those having only conifers. The predominance of broadleaf trees provide a greater abundance of food sources.

==Southern Coast, Transverse, and Peninsular Ranges mixed evergreen forest==
{{Further|California montane chaparral and woodlands}}
Also called '''southern mixed evergreen forests''', the mixed evergreen forests of the southern [[California Coast Ranges]], the [[Transverse Ranges]], and the northern [[Peninsular Ranges]], are restricted to cooler north-facing slopes at higher elevations. 

:Predominant tree species include:
*[[Tanoak|Tanoak (''Notholithocarpus densiflorus'')]]
*[[Arbutus menziesii|Madrone (''Arbutus menziesii'')]]
*[[Canyon live oak|Canyon live oak (''Quercus chrysolepis'')]]
*[[Coast live oak|Coast live oak (''Quercus agrifolia'')]]
*[[California bay laurel|California bay laurel (''Umbellularia californica'')]]
*[[Jeffrey pine| Jeffrey pine (''Pinus jeffreyi'')]]
*[[Coulter pine|Coulter pine (''Pinus coulteri'')]]
*Bigcone Douglas-fir (''[[Pseudotsuga macrocarpa]]'').

{{about|a type of city governance structure in the United States|city status conferred by Royal Charter in the United Kingdom|city status in the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United States]], a '''charter city''' is a [[city]] in which the [[governance|governing system]] is defined by the city's own [[charter]] document rather than by [[general-law municipality|general law]]. In states where city charters are allowed by law, a city can adopt or modify its organizing charter by decision of its administration by the way established in the charter. These cities may be administered predominantly by residents or through a third-party management structure, because a charter gives a city the flexibility to choose novel types of government structure. In conclusion, they do have certain rights.

==Examples==
===California=== 
For example, in [[California]], cities which have not adopted a charter are organized by state law. Such a city is called a General Law City, which will be managed by a 5-member city council.  A city organized under a charter may choose different systems, including the "strong mayor" or "city manager" forms of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charter Cities |publisher= League of California Cities |date=2007-05-09 |url=http://www.cacities.org/chartercities |accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=California Government Code, Title 4 Government of Cities, Chapter 2 Classification |publisher=[[California|State of California]] |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=34001-35000&amp;file=34100-34102 |accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 22 February 2013, 121 of California's 478 cities are charter cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charter Cities List |publisher= League of California Cities |date=22 February 2013 |url=http://www.cacities.org/Resources-Documents/Resources-Section/Charter-Cities/Charter_Cities-List |accessdate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few  examples include [[Norco, California#Government|Norco]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]], [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Merced, California | Merced]] and the capital, [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charter Cities|publisher=League of California Cities |url=http://www.cacities.org/index.jsp?zone=locc&amp;previewStory=571|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114220832/http://www.cacities.org/index.jsp?zone=locc&amp;previewStory=571 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-11-14  |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, charter cities that are subordinate to the rules of larger institutions (such as provinces or nations) have limited flexibility to adopt new governance structures.

== Development potential ==
{{Split section|date=February 2018}}
Economist [[Paul Romer]] proposes founding many new charter cities in developing countries. Romer suggests that a developing country pass a law that sets aside a tract of land for a new charter city.  This charter city would be administered by a developed third-party guarantor government, and citizens from the host country (and maybe other countries) could move in and out as they please.  The point of the charter cities idea is to give citizens the choice about where they want to live and to provide the basic rules and amenities required for economic growth. Ideally, by establishing a city with highly developed rules and governance in an underdeveloped region, living and working in a charter city may provide a closer and more attractive alternative to moving far away to more [[developed countries]].&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sebastian Mallaby|title=The Politically Incorrect Guide to Ending Poverty|journal=The Atlantic|date=July–August 2010|issue=|pages=|year=|pmid=|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-politically-incorrect-guide-to-ending-poverty/308134/1/?single_page=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chartercities"&gt;[http://www.chartercities.org/concept/ Concept] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511143027/http://www.chartercities.org/concept/ |date=May 11, 2011 }} from chartercities.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romer’s conception, there are three main factors in the creation of a charter city.  First, there is the developing host country.  The host country provides the land, and designates that land as a special reform zone, subject to the foundational set of rules.  Second, the developed guarantor country administers the region, perhaps with a board of governors and an appointed chairman like the [[Federal Reserve System]] in the United States.  Third, the source country will be where the charter city’s residents come from.  This may be predominantly from the host country, but there also may be a number of source countries.&lt;ref name="chartercities" /&gt;

In practice, some countries have been receptive to Romer's idea. After a meeting of Romer with president [[Marc Ravalomanana]], [[Madagascar]] considered creating two charter cities, but the plan was scrapped when the political leadership that supported the idea was removed from power.&lt;ref&gt;http://aidwatchers.com/2010/06/the-lure-of-starting-from-scratch/&lt;/ref&gt;   More recently, the government of [[Honduras]] has considered creating a charter city, though without the oversight of a third-party government. In 2011 Honduras made the necessary legal changes. Romer served as chair of a "transparency committee" but resigned in September 2012 when the Honduran government agency responsible for the project signed agreements with international developers without knowledge of the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plan for Charter City to Fight Honduras Poverty Loses Its Initiator|author=|date=30 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/world/americas/charter-city-plan-to-fight-honduras-poverty-loses-initiator.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 the [[Supreme Court of Honduras|Honduran Supreme Court]] declared charter cities to be unconstitutional because the laws of Honduras would not be applicable there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honduran supreme court rejects 'model cities' idea|author=|date=18 October 2012|work=Yahoo News|url=https://news.yahoo.com/honduran-supreme-court-rejects-model-cities-idea-171737298--finance.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://reason.com/archives/2013/05/13/the-blank-slate-state | title=The Blank Slate State | publisher=reason.com | date=June 2013 | accessdate=2013-05-16 | author=Brian Doherty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1226">'''CleanSeaNet''' is a satellite-based monitoring system for marine [[oil spill]] detection and surveillance in [[Europe]]an waters. 

The service is maintained by the [[European Maritime Safety Agency]] (EMSA) and provides a range of detailed information including oil spill alerts to Member States, rapid delivery of available satellite images and oil slick position.

The legal basis for the CleanSeaNet service is Directive 2005/35/EC on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties, including criminal penalties, for pollution offences (as amended by Directive 2009/123/EC). EMSA has been tasked to 'work with the Member States in developing technical solutions and providing technical assistance in relation to the implementation of this Directive, in actions such as tracing discharges by satellite monitoring and surveillance'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9988">The '''Creative Energy Homes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/creative-energy-homes/index.aspx|publisher=The University of Nottingham|title=Creative Energy Homes project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (CEH) project is a showcase of innovative state-of-the-art energy-efficient homes of the future. Seven homes constructed on the [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park Campus]] of the [[University of Nottingham]] are being designed and constructed to various degrees of innovation and flexibility to allow the testing of different aspects of modern methods of construction including layout and form, cladding materials, roof structures, foundations, glazing materials, thermal performance, building services systems, sustainable/[[renewable energy]] technologies, lighting systems, acoustics and water supply. The project aims to stimulate sustainable design ideas and promote new ways of providing affordable, environmentally sustainable housing that are innovative in their design. The homes are fully instrumented and occupied in order to provide comprehensive post occupancy evaluation data.

== The David Wilson House ==
[[File:CEH DavidWilsonHouse.jpg|thumb|left|The David Wilson Ecohouse]] Construction of the CEH project began in 1999 with the David Wilson Ecohouse.
This is a 4-bedroom detached property which uses brick and block construction. Its main purpose was to support research into domestic-sized renewable energy systems such as micro-CHP ([[Combined heat and power]]), [[solar thermal]], micro-wind, [[Light tube|sun pipes]], and natural ventilation devices.

The house is currently used as office space for University of Nottingham staff and continues to be used as a test bed for University research projects.

== The BASF House ==
The [http://www.house.basf.co.uk/ BASF house] was the 3rd house to be constructed and was completed in January 2008 taking only 25 weeks to build. The house was designed by Derek Trowell Architects [http://derektrowellarchitects.co.uk/basf-house/] to demonstrate that it is possible to build an affordable low energy house whilst still adherering to the [[Passivhaus]] ideology. It meets the level 4 standard of the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]].

The house has a compact floor area and relies as much as possible on passive solar design to keep costs down. The north, east and west walls are highly insulated, with the minimum number of openings compatible with acceptable day lighting standards. The southern elevation consists of a fully glazed two-layer adjustable sunspace with glazed screens that can be opened or closed to facilitate heating or cooling.

A [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|ground-air heat exchanger]], supplied by [http://www.rehau.co.uk/ Rehau], lies to the front of the house and this consists of a network of horizontal pipes buried approximately 2m underground. At this depth the soil temperature only varies between 8-12°C throughout the year. Therefore in winter cold air can be pre-heated before being drawn into the house and in the summer the air can be cooled.

A [[rainwater harvesting]] system has also been installed, which consists of a 3500 litres tank buried under the car parking space. It collects the run-off water from the roof. This water can be used for washing clothes, watering the garden, flushing the toilet and general cleaning. Water efficiency is also an important factor of the code for sustainable homes and using a rainwater harvesting system drastically reduces the amount of mains water used per person per day.

The [[Passive solar building design|sun space]], at the front of the house captures the solar gain from the sun, heating the air for use in the rest of the house. The south facing elevation is almost 100% glazed and the north facing elevation 30% glazed, providing improved quality of life in the home by maximising the use of natural daylight and reducing the energy required to light the home.

On the roof of the house are 3 solar thermal panels used for hot water heating. This is a larger system than is typical for this size of house, which allows storage of hot water for as long as 3 days and helps compensate for extended periods of overcast conditions.

== The E.ON 2016 House ==
The [http://www.eon-uk.com/about/2016house.aspx E.ON House] is a replica 1930s UK semi-detached house built primarily to research the impact of various retrofitting solutions on the existing housing stock.

According to the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]] (CfSH) all the new houses built from 2016 are required to meet Level 6 requirements of the CfSH, or be carbon zero. However, it is estimated that by the year 2050, 25 million existing UK homes will still account for between 70 and 90 percent of the housing stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Existing Housing and Climate Change|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcomloc/432/432i.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 25% of UK CO2 emissions derive from the domestic housing stock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Firth|first=Steven|title=Investigating CO2 emissions reduction in existing urban housing using a community domestic energy model|url=http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_2098_2105.pdf|work=Proceedings of the Eleventh International IBPSA Conference|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; so clearly there is a large opportunity to reduce UK carbon emissions by increasing the efficiency of existing homes.

The house is built to 1930s building regulations and the project developers had to receive special planning permission in order to construct the house. It has no roof or wall cavity insulation and uses single glazed windows. Hot water is provided by an outdated, inefficient non-condensing gas boiler and immersion heater. The plan is to bring this 1930s house to a top of the range home meeting Level 6 CfSH. It is hoped that the lessons learnt from this detailed research will help point the way to retrofitting homes to create more sustainable properties. The project consists of three phases:

# During the first phase the house was monitored in its original state. There are over 100 sensors positioned around the house monitoring temperature, relative humidity, electricity consumption of individual appliances, gas consumption, water consumption, total electricity consumption and occupancy.
# The second phase was carried out from August 2010 to June 2011. The building was upgraded with additional insulation, an improved heating system, double glazing, more efficient lighting and drought proofing. Research was carried out as to the impact of these improvements.
# In the third phase, due to begin in late 2011, further improvements will be made incorporating the installation of a conservatory-style extension creating a buffer zone between the property and the outside elements and a sun space to maximise solar gain. Renewable energy technologies, such as [[Photovoltaic panels|Solar panel]]  and solar hot water system will also be installed in order to supply the house with electricity and hot water.

== The Tarmac Homes ==
Tarmac have sponsored the construction of two semi-detached eco-homes called [http://www.tarmachomesproject.co.uk/ Tarmac House]. These are designed by [http://www.zedfactory.com/ ZEDfactory], the company responsible for the [[BEDZED]] project in south London. One home is built to Level 4 CfSH  and the other to Level 6 CfSH.

These houses demonstrate that it is possible to build a sustainable home using currently available materials and traditional methods of construction. Sustainability features of the properties include:

* Extremely well insulated walls with 250&amp;nbsp;mm of [[cavity wall insulation]].
* A [[Biomass heating system]] situated in front of the houses.
* A [[Solar water heating]] system with roof-mounted solar panels.
* [http://solarcentury.com/ Solar century] sun slates on the level 6 house helping to meet electricity demands.

== The Nottingham H.O.U.S.E (Home Optimising the Use of Solar Energy) ==
[http://www.nottinghamhouse.co.uk/ Nottingham H.O.U.S.E] is a small family "starter" home, which was built as a part of a [[Solar Decathlon Europe]] 2010 event by the students of the [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/Departments/abe/index.aspx Department of Architecture and Built Environment]. The house delivers a zero carbon sustainable design solution that is compliant with level 6 of UK's Code for Sustainable Homes. It is a prefabricated two storey house with a courtyard garden that can be used in terrace or semi-detached form.

The House was presented at the [http://www.ecobuild.co.uk/ Ecobuild] 2010 event and awarded with the prize for the best use of timber. The models of the house were also presented at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo 2010]]. The prefabricated house is due to be moved on to the University Park campus of the University of Nottingham in the near future.

== The Mark Group House ==
The Mark Group house is currently under construction.  It is a 4-bedroom property constructed using a steel framing system with insulation cladding. Construction of the basement uses an [[Insulating concrete form|Insulating Concrete Form]] (ICF) which incorporates [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag|Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag]] (GGBS) into the [[Portland cement]].

Manufacturing Portland cement produces around 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of concrete whereas GGBS, as a by-product of the iron industry, produces only 0.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. GGBS can be mixed with Portland cement 70%-30% to decrease its carbon footprint by around 40%{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[significance test]] whose aim is to detect the possible clustering of sub-populations within a clustered or non-uniformly-spread overall population. Possible applications of the test include examining the spatial clustering of childhood [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]] within the general population, given that the general population is spatially clustered.

The test is based on:
:*using control locations within the general population as the basis of a second or "control" sub-population in addition to the original "case" sub-population;
:*using "nearest-neighbour" analyses to form statistics based on either:
:**the number of other "cases" among the neighbours of each case;
:**the number "cases" which are nearer to each given case than the ''k''-th nearest "control" for that case.

An example application of this test was to spatial clustering of leukaemias and lymphomas among young people in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Dockerty, JD, Sharples, KJ, Borman, B (1999)

'''Denigomodu''' is a [[district]] in the western part of the island of [[Nauru]].It is the most populous settlement in Nauru.

It houses the expatriate housing compound The Location; this makes it Nauru's largest settlement by population. {{Asof|1999}} 25.7% of the people in Nauru live in Denigomodu.&lt;ref&gt;''Nauru Population Profile: A Guide for Planners and Policy-Makers''. Secretariat of the [[Pacific Community]], 1 January 1999. {{ISBN|9822036647}}, 9789822036640. p. 4: "The district of Denigomodu has the largest population, accounting for 25.7 per cent of Nauru's total population. This is mainly due to the Location Settlement being situated in this district, which houses all expatriate contract labour." - [https://www.google.com.sg/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q="The+district+of+Denigomodu+has+the+largest+population" See Google search page with quote stated]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The district, part of the [[constituency]] of [[Ubenide Constituency|Ubenide]], covers an area of 1.18&amp;nbsp;km², and has a population of 2,827, making it the most populous of the fourteen Nauruan districts.

==Local features==
In this district is the laborers' settlement for the [[phosphate]] mining workers of the [[Nauru Phosphate Corporation]] (NPC). Also located in Denigomodu are:

* the [[hospital]]
* NPC planning and construction offices
* Eigigu Supermarket

In [[ecology]], '''edge effects''' are changes in [[population ecology|population]] or [[community (ecology)|community]] structures that occur at the boundary of two or more [[habitat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Simon A.|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|page=780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas with small [[habitat fragmentation|habitat fragments]] exhibit especially pronounced edge effects that may extend throughout the range. As the edge effects increase, the boundary habitat allows for greater [[biodiversity]].

[[File:Edge Effect.jpg|thumb|250px|Edges arise where two habitat types come into contact as here in [[Pennsylvania]], United States.]]

==Types==
* Inherent &amp;ndash; Natural features stabilize the border location.
* Induced &amp;ndash; Transient natural disturbances (e.g., fire or flood) or human related activities, subject borders to successional changes over time.
* Narrow &amp;ndash; One habitat abruptly ends and another begins (e.g., an agricultural field.)
* Wide ([[ecotone]]) &amp;ndash; A large distance separates the borders of two clearly and purely definable habitats based upon their physical conditions and vegetation, and in between there exists a large transition region.
* Convoluted &amp;ndash; The border is non-linear.
* Perforated &amp;ndash; The border has gaps that host other habitats.

Height can create borders between patches as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Biodiversity==
Environmental conditions enable certain species of plants and animals to colonize habitat [[Geographic range limit|borders]]. Plants that colonize tend to be [[shade tolerance|shade-intolerant]] and [[Desiccation tolerance|tolerant of dry conditions]], such as [[shrubs]] and [[vines]]. Animals that colonize tend to be those that require two or more habitats, such as white-tailed and [[mule deer]], [[elk]], [[cottontail rabbits]], blue jays, and robins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | pmid =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some animals travel between habitats, while edge species are restricted to edges. Larger patches include more individuals and therefore have increased biodiversity. The width of the patch also influences diversity: an edge patch must be more pronounced than just a stark border in order to develop gradients of edge effects. 

Animals traveling between communities can create travel lanes along borders, which in turn increases light reaching plants along the lanes and promotes [[primary production]]. As more light reaches the plants, greater numbers and sizes can thrive. Increased primary production can increase numbers of herbivorous insects, followed by nesting birds and so on up the [[trophic level]]s.

In the case of wide and/or overgrown borders, some species can become restricted to one side of the border despite having the ability to inhabit the other. Sometimes, the edge effects result in [[abiotic]] and biotic conditions which diminish natural variation and threaten the original ecosystem. Detrimental edge effects are also seen in physical and chemical conditions of border species. For instance, fertilizer from an agricultural field could invade a bordering forest and contaminate the habitat. The three factors affecting edges can be summarized:
* Abiotic effect—Changes in the environmental conditions that result from the proximity to a structurally dissimilar matrix
* Direct biological effects—Changes in species abundance and distribution caused directly by physical conditions near the edge
* Indirect biological effects which involve changes in species interactions such as [[predation]], [[brood parasitism]], competition, [[herbivory]], and biotic [[pollination]] and [[seed dispersal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Human effects==
Human activity creates edges through development and agriculture. Often, the changes are detrimental to both the size of the habitat and to species. Examples of human impacts include:
* Introduction of [[invasive species|invasives]]/exotics
* Higher severity and frequency of fires
* Companion animals (pets) acting as predators and competitors
* Trails
* [[Pollution]], [[erosion]]
* [[habitat loss|Loss]] of foraging habitats

==Examples==
When edges divide any [[nature|natural]] ecosystem and the area outside the boundary is a disturbed or unnatural system, the natural ecosystem can be seriously affected for some distance in from the edge. In 1971, Odum wrote, 'The tendency for increased variety and diversity at community junctions is known as the ''edge effect''... It is common knowledge that the density of songbirds is greater on estates, campuses and similar settings...as compared with tracts of uniform forest.'. In a forest where the adjacent land has been cut, creating an open/forest boundary, [[sunlight]] and [[wind]] penetrate to a much greater extent, drying out the interior of the [[forest]] close to the edge and encouraging growth of opportunistic [[species]] there.  Air temperature, [[vapor pressure deficit]], [[water content|soil moisture]], light intensity and levels of [[photosynthetically active radiation]] (PAR) all change at edges.

===Amazon rainforest===
One study estimated that the amount of [[Amazon Basin]] area modified by edge effects exceeded the area that had been cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Primack}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller the fragment, the more susceptible it is to fires spreading from nearby cultivated fields. Forest fires are more common close to edges due to  increased light availability that leads to increased desiccation and increased [[understory]] growth. Increased understory [[biomass]] provides fuel that allows pasture fires to spread into the forests. Increased fire frequency since the 1990s is among the edge effects that are slowly transforming Amazonian forests. The changes in temperature, humidity and light levels promote invasion of non-forest species, including [[invasive species]]. The overall effect of these fragment processes is that all forest fragments tend to lose native [[biodiversity]] depending on fragment size and shape, isolation from other forest areas, and the forest matrix.&lt;ref name = "Corlett2011"/&gt;

===North America===
The amount of [[forest edge]] is orders of magnitude greater now in the [[United States]] than when the [[European ethnic groups|European]]s first began settling [[North America]].  Some species have benefited from this fact, for example, the [[brown-headed cowbird]], which is a [[brood parasite]] that lays its [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in the [[bird nest|nest]]s of [[songbird]]s nesting in forest near the forest boundary. Another example of a species benefiting from the proliferation of forest edge is [[Poison ivy (plant)|poison ivy]].

Conversely, [[Dragonfly|Dragonflies]] eat [[mosquito]]es, but have more trouble than mosquitoes surviving around the edges of human habitation.  Thus, trails and hiking areas near human settlements often have more mosquitoes than do deep forest habitats.  [[Grass]]es, [[huckleberry|huckleberries]], [[Ribes sanguineum|flowering currant]]s and [[shade-tolerant and -intolerant species|shade-intolerant]] trees such as the [[Douglas-fir]] all thrive in edge habitats.

In the case of developed lands juxtaposed to wild lands, problems with [[invasive exotic]]s often result. Species such as [[kudzu]], [[Japanese honeysuckle]] and [[multiflora rose]] have damaged natural ecosystems. Beneficially, the open spots and edges provide places for species&lt;!-- which? native or invasive, ruderal/pioneer? --&gt; that thrive where there is more light and vegetation that is close to the ground. Deer and elk benefit particularly{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} as their principal diet is that of grass and shrubs which are found only on the edges of forested areas.

==Effects on succession==
Edge effects also apply to [[ecological succession|succession]], when vegetation spreads rather than losing to competitors. Different species are suited either to the edges or to central sections of the habitat, resulting in a varied distribution. Edges also vary with orientation: edges on the north or south receive less or more sun than the opposite side (depending on hemisphere), producing varying vegetation patterns.

==Other usage==
The phenomenon of increased variety of plants as well as animals at the community junction ([[ecotone]]) is also called the edge effect and is essentially due to a locally broader range of suitable environmental conditions or ecological niches.

Edge effects in [[biological assay]]s refer to artifacts in data that are caused by the position of the wells on a screening plate rather than a biological effect.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The edge effect in [[scanning electron microscopy]] is the phenomenon in which the number of secondary and/or backscattered electrons that escape the sample and reach the detector is higher at an edge than at a surface. The interaction volume spreads far below the surface, but secondary electrons can only escape when close to the surface (generally about 10&amp;nbsp;nm, although this depends on the material).  However, when the electron beam impacts an area close to the edge, electrons that are generated below an impact point that is close to an edge but that is far below the surface may be able to escape through the vertical surface instead.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Galmudug''', officially '''Galmudug State''', is an [[Administrative divisions of Somalia|autonomous region]] in central [[Somalia]]. It is bordered to the north by the [[Puntland]] region, to the west by [[Ethiopia]], to the east by [[Indian Ocean]] and to the south by [[Hirshabelle]].

Galmudug's name is derived from a conflation of the names of the [[Galgaduud]] and [[Mudug]] regions.

==Location==
Galmudug is the most centrally located area in Somalia. It is situated about 750&amp;nbsp;km from [[Mogadishu]], [[Bosaso]] and [[Harar]] in [[Ethiopia]]. The region is bordered to the east by the [[Indian Ocean]], to the west by Ethiopia, to the north by [[Puntland]], and to the south by the [[Hiran, Somalia|Hiran]] region.

==History==

===Establishment===
On August 14, 2006, the autonomous Galmudug region was established. [[Mohamed Warsame Ali]] 'Kiimiko' was elected as the new administration's President, and [[Galkayo]] was declared the new polity's capital.&lt;ref name="Sgenlps"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Galmudug Elects New Leader, Pledges Security|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201208030100.html|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=SMN|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellation ''Galmudug'' is a conflation of Galguduud and Mudug provinces.

Relations between Galmudug and the Puntland region to its immediate north have historically been tense. However, the two regions gradually made strides toward strengthening inter-regional relations. To this end, representatives of the two autonomous administrations signed an accord in February 2011 in [[Garowe]], the capital of Puntland, wherein both governments officially agreed to cooperate on security, economic and social matters.&lt;ref name="Aajsbpagg"&gt;[http://www.somaliweyn.org/pages/news/Feb_11/PL-Galmudug-Accord.pdf An Agreement Jointly Signed by Puntland and Galmudug] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601002746/http://www.somaliweyn.org/pages/news/Feb_11/PL-Galmudug-Accord.pdf |date=2011-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential elections===
On 1 August 2012, Galmudug's 25-seat parliament elected General Abdi Hasan Awale (Qaybdiid) as the region's new president. He replaced former president Mohamed Ahmed Aalin, who was receiving medical treatment abroad.&lt;ref name="Sgenlps"/&gt; Qaybdiid had obtained 22 votes versus 1 vote for the other candidate, Abdisamad Nur Guled. Qaybdiid was subsequently sworn in as Galmudug President in a ceremony in Galkayo marking the 6th anniversary since the establishment of the Galmudug administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Qeybdid sworn in as Galmudug president| url=http://www.bar-kulan.com/2012/08/15/qeybdid-sworn-in-as-galmudug-president/ | work=Bar-kulan | date=2012-08-15 | accessdate=2012-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his inauguration speech, Qaybdiid reiterated his pre-election promises to firm up on regional security, expand his administration's control to areas that had not been covered by the regional authority, and foster relations with neighbouring regional states and national bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Mohamed | last=Beerdhige | title=Galmudug Elects New President | url=http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/3562 | work=Somalia Report | date=2012-08-01 | accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official status===
As of 2013, Galmudug's official status as a federal state is in the process of being finalized. Qaybdiid's administration has asserted that Galmudug meets the requirements for official state status, as outlined in the federal constitution. {{As of|2013|4}}, the federal authorities have not accepted this claim.&lt;ref name=Sgplcigs&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia govt 'pursuing leadership change in Galmudug': sources |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_govt_pursuing_leadership_change_in_Galmudug_sources_printer.shtml |accessdate=10 April 2013 |newspaper=Garowe Online |date=8 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925174303/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_govt_pursuing_leadership_change_in_Galmudug_sources_printer.shtml |archivedate=25 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 49 of the [[Constitution of Somalia|Provisional Federal Constitution]], which oversees the establishment of the Federal Republic of Somalia's constituent states, stipulates that "based on a voluntary decision, two or more regions may merge to form a Federal Member State".&lt;ref name="Frspc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Republic of Somalia - Provisional Constitution |url=http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124010543/http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |archivedate=24 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Galmudug only includes part of the official Mudug region, the federal Interior Minister Abdikarim Guled has urged the local Galmudug authorities to merge with other would be states, including [[Himan and Heeb]], to form one unitary state consisting of two or more regions, in accordance with the constitution.&lt;ref name=Prsmoians&gt;{{cite news|last=Somali Ministry of Interior and National Security|title=Press Release: Somali Ministry of Interior and National Security|url=http://www.radioogaal.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=651:somali-ministry-of-interior-and-national-security-&amp;catid=38:news-in-english&amp;Itemid=84|accessdate=10 April 2013|newspaper=Radio Gaal|date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2014, the Federal Government of Somalia officially endorsed a new [[Central Regions State]], following a signed agreement in Mogadishu between representatives from Galmudug, Himan and Heeb, and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]]. The formalization ceremony for the new federal state was held at the [[Villa Somalia]] presidential compound and was presided over by President of Somalia [[Hassan Sheikh Mohamud]] and Prime Minister [[Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed]], with UN, EU, AU, IGAD and AMISOM envoys also in attendance. According to the Prime Minister's office, the Federal Government appointed a ministerial committee to guide the formation of the new state. It also organized a number of consultative meetings with the regional representatives, with each party eventually agreeing to establish a new administration in the Mudug and Galguduud regions. Additionally, the Central Regions State will be subject to the Provisional Federal Constitution.&lt;ref name="Gsfgecsatd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Federal Govt endorses central state after tripartite deal|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Federal-Govt-endorses-central-state-after-tripartite-deal_printer.shtml|accessdate=31 July 2014|agency=Garowe Online|date=30 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812144757/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Federal-Govt-endorses-central-state-after-tripartite-deal_printer.shtml|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spmwatfnaics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somali Prime Minister welcomes agreement to form new administration in central Somalia|url=http://horseedmedia.net/news/2014/07/somali-prime-minister-welcomes-agreement-form-new-administration-central-somalia/|accessdate=31 July 2014|agency=Horseed Media|date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 2014, the autonomous Puntland regional administration in northeastern Somalia issued a statement rejecting the Central Regions State agreement on the grounds that it contravened certain clauses and articles in the [[Constitution of Somalia|Provisional Federal Constitution]] and breached Puntland's jurisdiction over the northern part of the Mudug province.&lt;ref name="Gspwsffg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Puntland withdraws support for Federal Govt|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Puntland-withdraws-support-for-Federal-Govt_printer.shtml|accessdate=1 August 2014|agency=Garowe Online|date=1 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812144815/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Puntland-withdraws-support-for-Federal-Govt_printer.shtml|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spcitwfgfacs"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: Puntland cuts its ties with Federal Government following announcement of Central State|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/08/somalia-puntland-cuts-its-ties-with-federal-government-following-announcement-of-central-state/|accessdate=1 August 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Puntland Council of Ministers led by Puntland President [[Abdiweli Mohamed Ali]] further expressed dismay over sponsorship of and attendance during the agreement by representatives of the central government and the international community, respectively. It also suspended relations with the Mogadishu authorities, and recalled Puntland's representatives serving in the Federal Parliament, Federal Cabinet and Federal Constitutional Review Committee to the Puntland state capital of [[Garowe]] for consultations.&lt;ref name="Gspwsffg"/&gt;

On 9 August 2014, the UN, EU and IGAD envoys for Somalia issued a joint statement assuring the Puntland administration that the new central state of Somalia would not include any territory under Puntland jurisdiction. According to the officials, federal government representatives and signatories had indicated prior to the signing of the central state agreement that the pact would only apply to Galguduud and Galmudug, while North Mudug would remain an integral part of Puntland state.&lt;ref name="Sueaiefsscstwm"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: UN, EU and IGAD envoys for Somalia send concern letter to Puntland president after the region suspended ties with Mogadishu|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/08/somalia-un-eu-and-igad-envoys-for-somalia-send-concern-letter-to-puntland-president-after-the-region-suspended-ties-with-mogadishu/|accessdate=21 August 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2014, Federal Parliament Speaker [[Mohamed Osman Jawari]] announced that Federal MPs hailing from Puntland had begun brokering negotiations between the federal government and the Puntland regional administration.&lt;ref name="Ssjhmembfap"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: Speaker Jawari hails MPs’ efforts to mediate between FG and Puntland|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/08/somalia-speaker-jawari-hails-mps-efforts-to-mediate-between-fg-and-puntland/|accessdate=24 August 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 2014, a three-day conference in Garowe concluded with a 12-point agreement between the Federal Government and Puntland authorities, which stipulates that the earlier Central Regions State pact between the Galmudug and Himan and Heeb regional administrations only applies to the Galguduud and south Mudug provinces.&lt;ref name="Spcdwfg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Puntland clinches deal with Federal Govt|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/page/show/post/610/somalia-puntland-clinches-deal-with-federal-govt|accessdate=14 October 2014|agency=Garowe Online|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 December 2014, ahead of a state formation conference in Adado, the Federal Government appointed six committees to oversee the establishment of the prospective Central Somalia regional state. The steering bodies include a technical committee facilitating the creation of Central State, which is chaired by Halimo Ismail Ibrahim; a constitution committee, which is chaired by Abdinoor Moalim Mohamud; a reconciliation committee tasked with solving of differences and selection of delegates, which is chaired by Sheikh Omar Mohamud Mahad; a security, protocol and supervision committee, which is chaired by Uke Haji Abdirahman; a mobilization committee, which is chaired by Abdullahi Abdi Abdille; and a committee of accommodation of delegates and guests of honour, which is chaired by Dahir Hassan Guutaale.&lt;ref name="Gfgfctffcs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal government finalizes committees to facilitate formation of Central state|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=7641|accessdate=26 December 2014|newspaper=Goobjoog|date=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2015, President Mohamud and Dhusamareb traditional elders began talks over a possible relocation of the Adado conference to Dhusamareb. Mohamud preferred holding the summit in Adado, whereas the traditional elders favored Dhusamareb for security-related reasons and because the town had already recently hosted smaller reconciliation meetings.&lt;ref name="Gdmcs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dhusa-Mareeb conference Spokesman: "there is chance discuss about where hold state formation conference"|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=12239|accessdate=27 March 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, during consultative talks with local politicians and traditional elders, President Mohamud officially announced that Dhusamareb was slated to be the administrative capital of the Central State.&lt;ref name="Gphaacuscs"&gt;{{cite news|title=President Hassan Announces Administrative Capital of Upcoming Somali Central State|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=12690|accessdate=8 April 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April, President Mohamud officially launched the Central State formation conference in Adado. The summit was attended by Federal Cabinet ministers and MPs, state formation technical committee Chairperson Halima Ismael, UN Special Envoy to Somalia Ambassador Nicholas Kay, IGAD Special Ambassador Mohamed Abdi Afey, Ambassador of Turkey Olgen Bakar and Uganda Special Envoy Nathan Mugisha. According to Mohamud, traditional leaders are now tasked with selecting 510 delegates, who will then elect a new regional president within two weeks.&lt;ref name="Ackoics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Adado conference kicks off in entral Somalia|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/page/show/post/2322/adado-conference-kicks-off-in-central-somalia|accessdate=16 April 2015|agency=Garowe Online|date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Djibouti'''  is a country in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Eritrea]] in the north, [[Ethiopia]] in the west and south, and [[Somalia]] in the southeast. To the east is its coastline on the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. Rainfall is sparse, and most of the territory has a semi-arid to arid environment. [[Lake Assal (Djibouti)|Lake Assal]] is a saline lake which lies 155&amp;nbsp;m (509&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level, making it the lowest point on land in [[Africa]] and the third-lowest point on Earth after the [[Sea of Galilee]] and the [[Dead Sea]]. [[Djibouti]]'s major settlements include the capital [[Djibouti City]], the port towns of [[Tadjoura]] and [[Obock]], and the southern cities of [[Ali Sabieh]] and [[Dikhil]]. It is the 147st largest country in the world by land area, covering a total of 23,200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 23,180&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is land and 20&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is water.&lt;ref name="Cwfbdj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=April 15, 2015|date=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Djibouti shares {{Convert|125|km|mi}} of border with Eritrea, {{Convert|343|km|mi}} with Ethiopia, and {{Convert|60|km|mi}} with Somalia (total {{Convert|528|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}). It has a strategic location on the [[Horn of Africa]] and the [[Bab el Mandeb]], along a route through the [[Red Sea]] and [[Suez Canal]]. Djibouti's coastline serves as a commercial gateway between the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the Horn region's interior. The country is also the terminus of [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|rail traffic into Ethiopia]].

==Physiographic regions==
Djibouti can be divided into four [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic regions]]
#The Northern Mountains
#Danakil Depression
#Grand Bara
#The Southern Mountains
[[File:Goda Mountains - National Park of Forêt du Day.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Goda Mountains]]

=== Mountains===
A great arc of mountains, consisting of the [[Mousa Ali]], [[Goda Mountains]], and [[Arrei Mountains]] surrounds [[Djibouti]].

Djibouti has eight mountain ranges with peaks of over 1,000 m (3,281&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="Hmid"&gt;[http://www.geonames.org/DJ/highest-mountains-in-djibouti.html Highest Mountains in Djibouti]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Mousa Ali]] range is considered the country's highest mountain range, with the tallest peak on the border with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. It has an elevation of 2,028 m.&lt;ref name="Hmid"/&gt;
* The [[Goda Mountains]] lie northwest of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] in [[Tadjoura Region]]. They rise to 1,750 m (5,740&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level and are the nation's largest heavily vegetated area.
* [[Garbi (mountain)|Garbi]] is a mountain in the west of Tadjourah Region. It has an elevation of 1680 metres (5,512&amp;nbsp;ft).
* The [[Arrei Mountains]] are in the southern [[Ali Sabieh Region]]. The mountain range has an elevation of 1,301 metres (4,268&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, and is situated near the border with Ethiopia.
* The [[Mabla Mountains]] are located in [[Obock Region]]. At 1780&amp;nbsp;m (5850&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, the mountains are situated behind the coastal plain where the Red Sea meets the Gulf of Aden, on the northern side of the Gulf of Tadjoura.
* The [[Dagouein Mountain]] sit at an elevation of 1,124 m (3,688&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.
* Hemed is a mountain in the western part of the [[Arta Region]] in south-central Djibouti. The summit is 1,103 metres (3,619&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.
* The [[Boura Mountains]]' highest peak has an elevation of 1037 m (3,402&amp;nbsp;ft. The ecology of this landform is [[semi-desert]]. The altitude and size of the range affects its weather, with precipitation levels varying greatly and climatic conditions consisting of distinct zones.

===Grand Bara===
[[File:Baadha Wayn (Grand Bara).jpg|230px|thumbnail|right|The Grand Bara Desert]]
The [[Grand Bara]] Desert covers parts of South Djibouti in [[Arta Region]], Ali Sabieh Region and [[Dikhil Region]]. The majority of the Grand Bara Desert lies at a relatively low elevation, below 1,700 feet (560 m). Home of the popular Grand Bara footrace.

===Coasts===
Most of Djibouti has been described as part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]]. The exception is a strip along the [[Red Sea]] coast, which is part of the [[Eritrean coastal desert]]; it is noted as an important migration route for birds of prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Eritrean coastal desert|id=at1304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Djibouti Regions==

==Climate==
[[File:Rainfall Of Djibouti.png|thumb|230px|The rainfall of Djibouti]]

There is not much seasonal variation in Djibouti's [[climate]]. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with winter rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from 32 to 41&amp;nbsp;°C (90 to 106&amp;nbsp;°F), except at high elevations. In [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti city]], for instance, afternoon highs in April typically range from 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82&amp;nbsp;°F) to 34&amp;nbsp;°C (93&amp;nbsp;°F) in April. Nationally, mean daily minima generally vary between sites from about 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;°C (59 to 86&amp;nbsp;°F). The greatest range in climate occurs in eastern Djibouti, where temperatures sometimes surpass 41&amp;nbsp;°C (106&amp;nbsp;°F) in July on the littoral plains and fall below freezing point during December in the highlands. In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40% in the mid-afternoon to 85% at night, changing somewhat according to the season.

[[File:Djibouti's map of Köppen climate classification.png|thumb|Köppen climate types of Djibouti]]
Djibouti has either a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') or a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh''), although temperatures are much moderated at the high elevations. On the eastern seaboard, annual rainfall is less than 5 inches (131&amp;nbsp;mm); in the central highlands, it is about 8 to 11 inches (200 to 300&amp;nbsp;mm). Although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year, the hinterland is typically hot and dry. The climate conditions are highly variable within the country and vary locally by altitude. Summers are very humid along the coast but dry in the [[highland]]s. Heat waves are frequent. Annual precipitation amounts vary greatly from one year to another. In general, rain falls more frequently and extensively in the mountains. Sudden and brutal storms are also known to occur. Wadis turn for a few hours into raging torrents tearing everything in their path, and their course is regularized{{clarify|date=September 2013}}. Rainwater serves as an additional water supply for livestock and plants alongside seasonal watercourses. The highlands have temperate climate throughout out the year. The climate of most lowland zones is arid and semiarid.

The climate of the interior shows notable differences from the coastline. Especially when one rises, the temperature is pleasant: it is so in [[Arta, Djibouti|Arta]], [[Randa, Djibouti|Randa]] and Day (where temperatures of 10 ° have been recorded).

===Water in Djibouti===
[[Water]] is becoming a scarce resource in Djibouti due to [[climate change]], which leads to different rainfall patterns as well as to inefficient methods of distribution within the country. Most of Djibouti’s rainfall is in the four months, but over the last 25 years, the Djibouti's Ministry of Environment estimates that rainfall has decreased overall between 5 and 20 percent. It is predicted that in future years, there will be higher temperatures, lower rainfall, and longer [[drought]]s, leading to even less access to water. Moreover, seawater intrusion or fossil saltwater contamination of the limited freshwater aquifers due to groundwater overexploitation affect those who live close to the coastline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=Geochemical, multi-isotopic studies and geothermal potential evaluation of the complex Djibouti volcanic aquifer (Republic of Djibouti)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292718302063|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.07.019|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In recent years, population growth has been increased rapidly with the addition of many refugees.

===Natural resources===
Unlike much of the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Middle East]] which is rich in lucrative crude oil, [[Djibouti]] has limited natural resources. These include potential geothermal power, [[gold]], clay, granite, [[limestone]], marble, [[salt]], diatomite, gypsum, pumice, petroleum.

==Environment==
Natural hazards include earthquakes, drought, and occasional [[cyclone|cyclonic disturbances]] from the [[Indian Ocean]], which bring heavy rains, and [[flash flood]]s. [[Natural resource]]s include [[geothermal energy]]. Inadequate supplies of [[potable water]], limited arable land and [[desertification]] are current issues.

Djibouti is a party to international agreements on [[biodiversity]], climate change, [[desertification]], endangered species, [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]], ozone layer protection, ship pollution, and wetlands.

==Coastline==
[[File:Republic of Djibouti Maritime Borders.png|thumb|right|350px|The Republic of Djibouti Maritime Borders.]]
[[Djibouti]] has a coastline which measures about 403 kilometres (250 mi). Much of the [[coastline]] is accessible and quite varied in geography and habitats.

==Human geography==
[[File:Satellite images of Djibouti during the night.png|thumb|right|Satellite images of Djibouti during the night.]]
{{further|List of cities in Djibouti|Districts of Djibouti}}
As of 2015, the population of Djibouti is 846 thousand.

For statistical purposes, the country has three areas; [[Djibouti City]] (population 529,000), [[Ali Sabieh]] (population 55,000), and [[Dikhil]] (population 54,000). Djibouti's population is diverse demographically; 60% [[Somali people|Somali]], 35% [[Afar people|Afar]], and 3% [[Arabs]]. In terms of religion, 94% [[Muslim]], 6% [[Christian]].

==Extreme points==
This is a list of the extreme points of [[Djibouti]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – [[Ras Doumera]], [[Obock Region]]
* Northernmost point (mainland) – the point at which the border with [[Eritrea]] enters the [[Red Sea]], [[Obock Region]]
* Easternmost point – unnamed section of the [[Red Sea]] coast north of [[Ras Bir]], [[Obock Region]]
* Southernmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Ethiopia]] west of the town of [[As Ela]], [[Dikhil Region]]
* Westernmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Ethiopia]] immediately east of the Ethiopian town of [[Afambo (woreda)|Afambo]], [[Dikhil Region]]

[[Ghana]] is a country in [[Africa]], along the [[Gulf of Guinea]], just a few degrees north of the [[equator]].
{{wikiatlas|Ghana}}

Ghana encompasses [[plain]]s, low [[hill]]s, rivers, [[Lake Volta]], the world's largest artificial lake, [[Dodi Island]] and [[Bobowasi Island]] on the south Atlantic Ocean coast of Ghana.&lt;ref name="Ghana low plains"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/ghana/geography/ghana_geography_the_low_plains.html|title=Ghana low plains|work=photius.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana can be divided into four different geographical [[ecoregion]]s. The [[coastline]] is mostly a low, [[sand]]y [[shore]] backed by plains and [[Shrubland|scrub]] and intersected by several rivers and [[stream]]s. The northern part of Ghana features high [[plain]]s.&lt;ref name="Ghana high plains"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/ghana/geography/ghana_geography_the_high_plains.html|title=Ghana high plains|work=photius.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; South-west and south-central Ghana is made up of a forested [[plateau]] region consisting of the [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]] [[Highland|uplands]] and the [[Kwahu Plateau]]. The hilly Akwapim-Togo [[Mountain range|ranges]] are found along Ghana's eastern [[international border]].&lt;ref name="Ghana: Ashanti-Kwahu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/ghana/geography/ghana_geography_ashanti_uplands.html|title=Ghana ashanti-kwahu uplands |work=photius.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Volta Basin]] takes up most of south-central Ghana and Ghana's highest point is [[Mount Afadja]] which is {{convert|885|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and is found in the Akwapim-Togo [[Mountain range|ranges]].&lt;ref name="Ghana: Akwapim-Togo Ranges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/ghana/geography/ghana_geography_akwapim_togo_ranges.html|title=Ghana: Akwapim-Togo Ranges|work=photius.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghana: Volta Basin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/ghana/geography/ghana_geography_volta_basin.html|title=Ghana: Volta Basin|work=photius.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and the [[Dahomey Gap|eastern coastal belt]] is warm and comparatively dry, the south-west corner of Ghana is hot and [[Humidity|humid]], and the north of Ghana is warm and wet.&lt;ref name="Ghana high plains"/&gt; [[Lake Volta]], the world's largest artificial [[lake]], extends through small portions of south-eastern Ghana and many tributary rivers such as the [[Oti River|Oti]] and [[Afram River|Afram]] rivers flow into it.&lt;ref name="Ghana: Rivers and Lakes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/ghana/geography/ghana_geography_rivers_and_lakes.html|title=Ghana rivers and lakes|work=photius.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The northernmost part of Ghana is Pulmakong and the southernmost part of Ghana is [[Cape Three Points|Cape three points]] near Axim. Ghana lies between latitudes [[4th parallel north|4°]] and [[12th parallel north|12°N]].&lt;ref name="Geography Physical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/ghana/geography/ghana_geography_physical_setting.html|title=Ghana: Geography Physical|work=photius.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2013}}, {{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/ghana/geography/ghana_geography_location_and_size.html|title=Ghana: Location and Size|work=photius.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Ghana contains [[evergreen]] and [[semi-deciduous]] forests consisting of trees such as [[mahogany]], &lt;!--There is no Wikipedia article for [[Odom (tree)|odum]]--&gt;[[Milicia excelsa|odum]], [[ebony]] and it also contains much of Ghana's [[oil palm]]s and [[mangroves]] with [[shea tree]]s, [[Adansonia digitata|baobabs]] and [[acacias]] found in the northern part of Ghana.&lt;ref name="Geography Physical"/&gt;

==Location and density==
* ''In Relative terms:''
Ghana, which lies in the center of the Gulf of Guinea coast, 2,420&amp;nbsp;km of land borders with three countries: [[Burkina Faso]] (602&amp;nbsp;km) to the north, [[Ivory Coast]] (720&amp;nbsp;km) to the west, and [[Togo]] (1,098&amp;nbsp;km) to the east. To the south are the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean.
* ''In Absolute terms:''
Its southernmost coast at [[Cape Three Points]] is 4° 30' north of the equator. From here, the country extends inland for some 670 kilometers to about [[11th parallel north|11° north]]. The distance across the widest part, between longitude 1° 12' east and longitude 3° 15' west, measures about 560 kilometers.

The [[Greenwich Meridian]], which passes through London, also traverses the eastern part of Ghana at [[Tema]].
* With a total area of 239,460 square kilometers, Ghana is about the size of the [[United Kingdom]] and slightly smaller than the state of [[Oregon]] in [[United States]].

==Terrain of Ghana==
The terrain consists small desert mountains with the [[Kwahu Plateau]] in the south-central area. Half of Ghana lies less than {{convert|152|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level, and the highest point is {{convert|883|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The {{convert|537|km|mi|0|sp=us}} coastline is mostly a low, sandy shore backed by plains and scrub and intersected by several rivers and streams, most of which are navigable only by [[canoe]]. 

A [[tropical rain forest]] belt, broken by heavily forested hills and many streams and rivers, extends northward from the shore, near the [[Ivory Coast]] frontier. This area, known as the "Ashanti," produces most of Ghana's [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[minerals]], and [[timber]]. North of this belt, the elevation varies from {{convert|91|to|396|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level and is covered by low bush, park-like [[savanna]], and grassy plains.

==Geographical regions==
[[File:Ghana map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|A [[Köppen climate classification]] map of Ghana.]]
[[Image:Ghana Topography.png|thumb|Ghana's topography.]]
Ghana is characterized in general by low physical [[Terrain|relief]]. The [[Precambrian]] rock system that underlies most of the nation has been worn down by erosion almost to a plain. The highest elevation in Ghana, [[Mount Afadja]] in the [[Akwapim-Togo]] Ranges, rises 880 meters above sea level.

There are four distinct geographical regions. Low plains stretch across the southern part of Ghana. To their north lie three regions—the Ashanti Uplands, the Akwapim-Togo Ranges, and the Volta Basin. The fourth region, the high plains, occupies the northern and northwestern sector of Ghana. Like most West African countries, Ghana has no natural harbors. Because strong surf pounds the shoreline, two artificial harbors were built at [[Takoradi]] and [[Tema]] (the latter completed in 1961) to accommodate Ghana's shipping needs.

===Low plains===
[[Image:Volta Region Ghana.jpg|thumb|300px|The Akwapim-Togo Ranges.]]
The low plains comprise the four subregions of the coastal savanna, the [[Volta Delta]], the [[Accra Plains]], and the [[Akan lowlands or peneplains]]. A narrow strip of grassy and scrubby coast runs from a point near [[Takoradi]] in the west to the [[Togo]] border in the east. This coastal savanna, only about eight kilometers in width at its western end, stretches eastward through the Accra Plains, where it widens to more than eighty kilometers, and terminates at the southeastern corner of the country at the lower end of the Akwapim-Togo Ranges.

Almost flat and featureless, the Accra Plains descend gradually to the gulf from a height of about 150 meters. The topography east of the city of Accra is marked by a succession of ridges and spoonshaped valleys. The hills and slopes in this area are the favored lands for cultivation. [[Shifting cultivation]] is the usual agricultural practice because of the swampy nature of the very lowlying areas during the rainy seasons and the periodic blocking of the rivers at the coast by sandbars that form lagoons. A plan to irrigate the Accra Plains was announced in 1984. Should this plan come to reality, much of the area could be opened to large-scale cultivation.

To the west of Accra, the low plains contain wider valleys and rounded low hills, with occasional rocky headlands. In general the land is flat and covered with grass and scrub. Dense groves of coconut palms front the coastline. Several commercial centers, including Winneba, Saltpond, and Cape Coast are located here. Winneba has a small livestock industry and palm tree cultivation is expanding in the area away from the coast, with the predominant occupation of the coastal inhabitants being fishing via dug-out canoe.

The Volta Delta, which forms a distinct subregion of the low plains, extends into the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the extreme southeast. The delta's rock formation—consisting of thick layers of [[sandstone]], some [[limestone]], and [[silt]] deposits—is flat, featureless, and relatively young. As the delta grew outward over the centuries, sandbars developed across the mouths of the Volta and smaller rivers that empty into the gulf in the same area, forming numerous lagoons, some quite large, making road construction difficult. 

To avoid the lowest-lying areas the road between Accra and Keta makes a detour inland just before reaching Ada, and approaches Keta from the east along the narrow spit on which the town stands. Road links with Keta continue to be a problem. By 1989 it was estimated that more than 3,000 houses in the town had been swallowed by flooding from the lagoon. About 1,500 other houses were destroyed by erosion caused by the powerful waves of the sea.

This flat, silt-composed delta region with its abundance of water supports [[shallot]], [[maize|corn]], and [[cassava]] cultivation in the region. The sandy soil of the delta gave rise to the [[copra]] industry. [[Salt]]-making, from the plentiful supply in the dried beds of the lagoons, provides additional employment. The main occupation of the delta people is fishing, an industry that supplies dried and salted fish to other parts of the country.

The largest part of the low plains is the Akan Lowlands. Some experts prefer to classify this region as a subdivision of the [[Ashanti Uplands]] because of the many characteristics they share. Unlike the uplands, the height of the Akan Lowlands is generally between sea level and 150 meters. Some ranges and hills rise to about 300 meters, but few exceed 600 meters. The lowlands that lie to the south of the Ashanti Uplands receive the many rivers that make their way to the sea.

The Akan Lowlands contain the basins of the [[Densu River]], the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra River]], the [[Ankobra River]], and the [[Tano River]], all of which play important roles in the economy of Ghana. The Densu River Basin, location of the important urban centers of [[Koforidua]] and [[Nsawam]] in the eastern lowlands, has an undulating topography. Many of the hills here have craggy summits, which give a striking appearance to the landscape. The upper section of the Pra River Basin, to the west of the Densu, is relatively flat. The topography of its lower reaches resembles that of the Densu Basin and is a rich cocoa and food-producing region. The valley of the Birim River, one of the main tributaries of the Pra, is Ghana's most important diamond-producing area.

The Ankobra River Basin and the middle and lower basins of the Tano River to the west of the lowlands form the largest subdivision of the Akan Lowlands. Here annual rainfall between 1,500 and 2,150 millimeters helps assure a dense forest cover. In addition to timber, the area is rich in minerals. The Tarkwa goldfield, the diamond operations of the [[Bonsa Valley]], and high-grade manganese deposits are all found in this area. The middle and lower Tano basins have been intensely explored for oil and natural gas since the mid-1980s. The lower basins of the Pra, Birim, Densu, and Ankobra rivers are also sites for palm tree cultivation.

Comprising the Southern Ashanti Uplands and the Kwahu Plateau, the Ashanti Uplands lie just north of the Akan Lowlands and stretch from the Ivory Coast border in the west to the elevated edge of the Volta Basin in the east. Stretching in a northwest-to-southeast direction, the Kwahu Plateau extends 193 kilometers between Koforidua in the east and Wenchi in the northwest. The average elevation of the plateau is about 450 meters, rising to a maximum of 762 meters. The relatively cool temperatures of the plateau were attractive to Europeans, particularly missionaries, who founded many well-known schools and colleges in this region.

The plateau forms one of the important physical divides in Ghana. From its northeastern slopes, the Afram and Pru Rivers flow into the Volta River, while from the opposite side, the Pra, Birim, Ofin, Tano, and other rivers flow south toward the sea. The plateau also marks the northernmost limit of the forest zone. Although large areas of the forest cover have been destroyed through farming, enough deciduous forest remains to shade the head waters of the rivers that flow from the plateau.

The Southern Ashanti Uplands, extending from the foot of the Kwahu Plateau in the north to the lowlands in the south, slope gently from an elevation of about 300 meters in the north to about 150 meters in the south. The region contains several hills and ranges as well as several towns of historical and economic importance, including [[Kumasi]], Ghana's second largest city and former capital of the Asante. [[Obuasi]] and [[Konongo, Ghana|Konongo]], two of the country's gold-mining centers, are also located here. The region is Ghana's chief producer of cocoa, and its tropical forests continue to be a vital source of timber for the lumber industry.

===Volta Basin===

Taking the central part of Ghana, the Volta Basin covers about 45 percent of the nation's total land surface. Its northern section, which lies above the upper part of [[Lake Volta]], rises to a height of 150 to 215 meters above sea level. Elevations of the Konkori Scarp to the west and the Gambaga Scarp to the north reach from 300 to 460 meters. To the south and the southwest, the basin is less than 300 meters. The Kwahu Plateau marks the southern end of the basin, and forms a natural part of the Ashanti Uplands.

The basin is characterized by poor soil, generally of Voltaian [[sandstone]]. Annual rainfall averages between 1,000 and 1,140 millimeters. The most widespread vegetation type is [[savanna]], the woodlands of which, depending on local soil and climatic conditions, may contain such trees as red ironwood and shea.

The basin's population, principally farmers, is low in density, especially in the central and northwestern areas of the basin, where tsetse flies are common. Archeological finds indicate that the region was once more heavily populated. Periodic burning occurred over extensive areas for perhaps more than a millennium, exposing the soil to excessive drying and erosion, rendering the area less attractive to cultivators.

In contrast with the rest of the region are the [[Afram Plains]], located in the southeastern corner of the basin. Here the terrain is low, averaging 60 to 150 meters in elevation, and annual rainfall is between 1,140 and about 1,400 millimeters. Near the Afram River, much of the surrounding countryside is flooded or swampy during the rainy seasons. With the creation of Lake Volta (8500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area) in the mid-1960s, much of the Afram Plains was submerged. Despite the construction of roads to connect communities displaced by the lake, road transportation in the region remains poor. Renewed efforts to improve communications, to enhance agricultural production, and to improve standards of living began in earnest in the mid-1980s.

[[Volta River]] has three main tributaries—the [[Black Volta]], [[White Volta]] and [[Red Volta]].}}

===High plains===

The general terrain in the northern and northwestern part of Ghana outside the Volta Basin consists of a dissected plateau, which averages between 150 and 300 meters in elevation and, in some places, is even higher. Rainfall averages between 1,000 and 1,150 millimeters annually, although in the northwest it is closer to 1,350 millimeters. Soils in the high plains are more arable than those in the Volta Basin, and the population density is considerably higher. Grain and cattle production are the major economic activities in the high plains of the northern region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghana - The High Plains|url=http://www.mongabay.com/history/ghana/ghana-the_high_plains.html|publisher=Mongabay.com|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1980s, when former United States President Jimmy Carter's Global 2000 program (see Glossary) adopted Ghana as one of a select number of African countries whose local farmers were to be educated and financially supported to improve agricultural production, there has been a dramatic increase in grain production in northern Ghana. The virtual absence of tsetse flies in the region has led to increased livestock raising as a major occupation in the north. The region is Ghana's largest producer of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghana - The High Plains|url=http://www.mongabay.com/history/ghana/ghana-the_high_plains.html|publisher=Mongabay.com|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivers and lakes==
{{See also|List of rivers of Ghana|l1=Rivers in Ghana}}
[[Image:Lake Volta Ghana.jpg|thumb|200px|Lake Volta]]
[[Image:Lake Bosumtwi1, Ghana.jpg|thumb|200px|Lake Bosumtwi]]

Ghana is drained by a large number of streams and rivers. In addition, there are a number of coastal lagoons, the huge man-made [[Lake Volta]], and [[Lake Bosumtwi]] created by a [[meteorite]], southeast of [[Kumasi]] and which has no outlet to the sea. In the wetter south and southwest areas of Ghana, the river and stream pattern is denser, but in the area north of the [[Kwahu Plateau]], the pattern is much more open, making access to water more difficult. Several streams and rivers also dry up or experience reduced flow during the dry seasons of the year, while flooding during the rainy seasons is common.

The major drainage divide runs from the southwest part of the Akwapim-Togo Ranges northwest through the Kwahu Plateau and then irregularly westward to the Ivory Coast border. Almost all the rivers and streams north of this divide form part of the Volta system. Extending about 1,600 kilometers in length and draining an area of about 388,000 square kilometers, of which about 158,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lie within Ghana, the Volta and its tributaries, such as the [[Afram River]] and the Oti River, drain more than two thirds of Ghana. To the south of the divide are several smaller, independent rivers. The most important of these are the Pra River, the Tano River, the Ankobra River, the [[Birim River]], and the [[Densu River]]. With the exception of smaller streams that dry up in the dry seasons or rivers that empty into inland lakes, all the major rivers in Ghana flow into the Gulf of Guinea directly or as tributaries to other major rivers. The Ankobra and Tano are navigable for considerable distances in their lower reaches.

[[Image:Lake Volta, Ghana.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lake Volta]] is the world's largest artificially created lake.]]
Navigation on the Volta River has changed significantly since 1964. Construction of the dam at Akosombo, about 80 kilometers upstream from the coast, created the vast Lake Volta and the associated 1020 megawatt hydroelectric project. Arms of the lake extended into the lower-lying areas, forcing the relocation of 78,000 people to newly created townships on the lake's higher banks. The Black Volta River and the White Volta River flow separately into the lake. Before their confluence was submerged, the rivers came together in the middle of Ghana to form the main Volta River. 

The Oti River and the Daka River, the principal tributaries of the Volta in the eastern part of Ghana, and the Pru River, the Sene River, and the Afram River, major tributaries to the north of the Kawhu Plateau, also empty into flooded extensions of the lake in their river valleys. Lake Volta is a rich source of fish, and its potential as a source for irrigation is reflected in an agricultural mechanization agreement signed in the late 1980s to irrigate the Afram Plains. The lake is navigable from Akosombo through Yeji in the middle of Ghana. A 24-meter [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]] was commissioned in 1989 to link the Afram Plains to the west of the lake with the lower Volta region to the east. Hydroelectricity generated from Akosombo supplies Ghana, Togo, and Benin.

On the other side of the Kwahu Plateau from Lake Volta are several river systems, including the Pra, Ankobra, Tano and Densu. The Pra is the easternmost and the largest of the three principal rivers that drain the area south of the Volta divide. Rising south of the Kwahu Plateau and flowing southward, the Pra enters the Gulf of Guinea east of Takoradi. In the early part of the twentieth century, the Pra was used extensively to float timber to the coast for export. This trade is now carried by road and rail transportation.

The Ankobra, which flows to the west of the Pra, has a relatively small drainage basin. It rises in the hilly region of [[Bibiani]] and flows in a southerly direction to enter the gulf just west of [[Axim]]. Small craft can navigate approximately eighty kilometers inland from its mouth. At one time, the Ankobra helped transport machinery to the gold-mining areas in the vicinity of [[Tarkwa]]. The Tano, which is the westernmost of the three rivers, rises near [[Techiman]] in the center of the country. It also flows in a southerly direction, and it empties into a lagoon in the southeast corner of Ivory Coast. Navigation by steam launch is possible on the southern sector of the Tano for about 70 kilometers.

A number of rivers are found to the east of the Pra. The two most important are the Densu and Ayensu, both of which rise in the [[Atewa Range]], and which are important as sources of water for [[Accra]] and [[Winneba]] respectively. The country has one large natural lake, Lake Bosumtwi, located about 32 kilometers southeast of Kumasi. It occupies the steep-sided meteoric crater &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/bosumtwi.htm |title=UNB &amp;#124; Planetary and Space Science Centre |publisher=Unb.ca |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an area of about 47 square kilometers. A number of small streams flow into Lake Bosumtwi, but there is no drainage from it. Apart from providing an opportunity for fishing for local inhabitants, the lake serves as a tourist attraction.

== Natural hazards ==
Dry, dusty, [[harmattan]] winds occur from January to March. Ghana is also prone to [[droughts]], and was severely affected by [[floods]] in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Heavy floods caused loss of life and widespread damage in 2007 and 2009. See also [[2007 African floods#Ghana]] and [[2009 West Africa floods#Ghana|2009 West Africa floods]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental issues ==
Environmental issues include recurrent drought in the north, severely affecting agricultural activities, [[deforestation]], overgrazing, [[soil erosion]], poaching and habitat destruction threatens wildlife populations, water pollution, and inadequate supplies of potable water

On the south, India projects into and is bounded by the [[Indian Ocean]] –- in particular, by the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west, the [[Lakshadweep Sea]] to the southwest, the [[Bay of Bengal]] on the east, and the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean proper]] to the South . The [[Palk Strait]] and [[Gulf of Mannar]] separate India from [[Sri Lanka]] to its immediate southeast, and the [[Maldives]] are some {{convert|125|km}} to the south of India's [[Lakshadweep Islands]] across the [[Maliku Kandu|Eight Degree Channel]]. India's [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], some {{convert|1200|km}} southeast of the mainland, share [[maritime boundary|maritime borders]] with [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]] and [[Indonesia]].

The northern frontiers of India are defined largely by the [[Himalayas|Himalayan mountain range]], where the country borders [[China]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Nepal]]. Its [[Indo-Pakistani border|western border with Pakistan]] lies in the [[Karakoram range]], [[Punjab Plain]]s, the [[Thar Desert]] and the [[Rann of Kutch]] salt marshes. In the far northeast, the [[Chin Hills]] and [[Kachin Hills]], deeply forested mountainous regions, separate India from Burma. On the east, [[Bangladesh–India border|its border]] with [[Bangladesh]] is largely defined by the [[Khasi Hills]] and [[Mizo Hills]], and the watershed region of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]].{{clarify|date=May 2011|reason=not clear how the "watershed region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain" defines the India-Bangladesh border; most rivers of the region flow right across the border, no?}}

The [[Ganges|Ganga]] is the longest river originating in India. The Ganga–[[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] system occupies most of northern, central, and eastern India, while the [[Deccan Plateau]] occupies most of southern India. [[Kangchenjunga|Kanchanjhunga]], in the Indian state of Sikkim, is the highest point in India at {{convert|8586|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and the [[list of highest mountains|world's 3rd highest peak]]. Climate across India ranges from equatorial in the far south, to [[Alpine climate|alpine]] and [[Tundra climate|tundra]] in the upper reaches of the Himalayas. the geographic view of India is pretty expository and vivid in the terms of area, mountains and relief.

==Geological development==
[[Image:Himalaya-formation.gif|left|thumb|The Indian Plate]]
{{Main|Geology of India}}
India is situated entirely on the [[Indian Plate]], a major [[tectonic plate]] that was formed when it split off from the ancient continent [[Gondwanaland]] (ancient landmass, consisting of the southern part of the supercontinent of Pangea). The Indo-Australian plate is subdivided into the Indian and Australian plates. About 90 million years ago, during the late [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous Period]], the Indian Plate began moving north at about 15&amp;nbsp;cm/year (6 in/yr).&lt;ref name="AII"&gt;{{cite book|title=Age of Initiation of the India-Asia Collision in the East-Central Himalaya|url=http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rowley/Rowley/Collision_Age_files/J%20Geol%202005%20Zhu.pdf|author=Zhu, Bin |publisher=Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, [[University at Albany]]|pages=281|format=PDF|accessdate=19 November 2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 50 to 55 million years ago, in the [[Eocene|Eocene Epoch]] of the [[Cenozoic|Cenozoic Era]], the plate collided with Asia after covering a distance of {{convert|2000|to|3000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, having moved faster than any other known plate. In 2007, German geologists determined that the Indian Plate was able to move so quickly because it is only half as thick as the other plates which formerly constituted Gondwanaland.&lt;ref name=EUREKA&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Fastest Continent: India's truncated lithospheric roots|author=Kind, Rainer |publisher=Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collision with the [[Eurasian Plate]] along the modern border between India and Nepal formed the [[orogeny|orogenic belt]] that created the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and the [[Himalayas]]. {{As of|2009}}, the Indian Plate is moving northeast at 5&amp;nbsp;cm/yr (2 in/yr), while the Eurasian Plate is moving north at only 2&amp;nbsp;cm/yr (0.8 in/yr). India is thus referred to as the "fastest continent".&lt;ref name=EUREKA/&gt; This is causing the Eurasian Plate to deform, and the Indian Plate to compress at a rate of 4&amp;nbsp;cm/yr (1.6 in/yr).

==Political geography==
{{Main|States and territories of India}}
India is divided into 29 states (further subdivided into [[List of Indian districts|districts]]) and 7 [[union territories]] including   The National capital territory (I.e., [[Delhi]]).
India's borders run a total length of {{convert|15200|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="DBM"/&gt;

Its borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh were delineated according to the [[Radcliffe Line]], which was created in 1947 during [[Partition of India]]. Its western border with Pakistan extends up to {{convert|3323|km|mi|abbr=on}}, dividing the [[Punjab region]] and running along the boundaries of the Thar Desert and the [[Rann of Kutch]].&lt;ref name="DBM"/&gt; This border runs along the Indian states of [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Gujarat]], and [[Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/BM_MAN-IN-PAKS-060513.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Both nations delineated a [[Line of Control]] (LoC) to serve as the informal boundary between the Indian and Pakistan-administered areas of Kashmir. According to India's claim, it also shares a {{convert|106|km|mi|abbr=on}} border with Afghanistan in northwestern Kashmir, which is under Pakistani control.&lt;ref name="DBM"/&gt;

India's border with Bangladesh runs {{convert|4096.70|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="DBM"/&gt; [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]] are the States which share the border with Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/BM_MAN-IN-BANG-270813.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2015, there were 92 enclaves of Bangladesh on Indian soil and 106 enclaves of India were on Bangladeshi soil.&lt;ref name=HINDU&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Nowhere People |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1912/19120600.htm |journal=Frontline Magazine, [[The Hindu]] |author=Naunidhi Kaur |volume=19 |issue=12 |date=June 2002 |accessdate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208161351/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1912/19120600.htm |archivedate=8 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[India–Bangladesh enclaves|enclaves]] were eventually exchanged in order to simplify the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = India, Bangladesh ratify historic land deal, Narendra Modi announces new $2 billion line of credit to Dhaka – Times of India|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-Bangladesh-ratify-historic-land-deal-Narendra-Modi-announces-new-2-billion-line-of-credit-to-Dhaka/articleshow/47567164.cms|website = The Times of India|accessdate = 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the exchange, India lost roughly 40&amp;nbsp;km² (10,000 acres) to Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = India-Bangla land swap: was the world's strangest border created by a game of chess?|url = http://scroll.in/article/725804/india-bangla-land-swap-how-the-worlds-strangest-border-was-created-by-a-game-of-chess|website = Scroll.in|accessdate = 1 January 2016|first = Shoaib|last = Daniyal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Line of Actual Control]] (LAC) is the effective border between India and the People's Republic of China.

[[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Nagaland]], [[Manipur]] and [[Mizoram]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/Indo-Myanmar-1011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Located amidst the Himalayan range, India's border with Bhutan runs {{convert|699|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="DBM"/&gt; [[Sikkim]], [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] are the States, which
share the border with Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/Indo-Bhutan-1011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The border with Nepal runs {{convert|1751|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India.&lt;ref name="DBM"/&gt; [[Uttarakhand]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Sikkim]] are the States, which share the border with Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/Indo-Nepal-270813.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Siliguri Corridor]], narrowed sharply by the borders of Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh, connects peninsular India with the northeastern states.

==Physiographic regions==
[[File:India topo big.jpg|thumb|Topography map]]

India can be divided into six [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic regions]]. They are:
* Northern Mountains
* Peninsular Plateau
* Indo-Gangetic Plain
* Thar Desert
* Coastal Plains
* Islands

===The Himalayas===
[[File:Snow Leopard in Hemis National Park.jpg|thumb|Snow leopard at [[Hemis National Park]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]]]]
An arc of mountains consisting of the Himalayas , [[Hindu Kush]], and [[Patkai]] ranges define the northern frontiers of the Indian subcontinent. These were formed by the [[destructive boundary|ongoing tectonic plates collision]] of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The mountains in these ranges include some of the world's tallest mountains which act as a colourfull barrier to cold polar winds. They also facilitate the [[monsoon]] winds which in turn influence the climate in India. Rivers originating in these mountains flow through the fertile Indo–Gangetic plains. These mountains are recognised by [[biogeography|biogeographers]] as the boundary between two of the Earth's great ecozones: the [[temperate]] [[Palearctic]] that covers most of Eurasia and the tropical and subtropical [[Indomalaya]] ecozone which includes the Indian subcontinent, [[Southeast Asia]] and Indonesia.

[[File:KedarRange.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A shining white snow-clad range, framed against a turquoise sky. In the middle ground, a ridge descends from the right to form a saddle in the centre of the photograph, partly in shadow. In the near foreground, a loop of a road is seen.|The Kedar Range of the Greater Himalayas rises behind [[Kedarnath Temple]] (Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]]), which is one of the twelve [[Jyotirlinga|''jyotirlinga'' shrines]].]]
The Himalayan range is the world's highest mountain range, with its tallest peak Mt. [[Everest]] ({{convert|8848|m|disp=sqbr}}) on the Nepal–China border.&lt;ref name="manorama2"&gt;{{cite book|title = Manorama Yearbook 2006 (India – The Country)| publisher = Malayala Manorama | year = 2006 | page = 516 | issn = 0542-5778}}&lt;/ref&gt; They form India's northeastern border, separating it from northeastern Asia. They are one of the world's youngest mountain ranges and extend almost uninterrupted for {{convert|2500|km|mi||abbr=on}}, covering an area of {{convert|500000|km2|mi2||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="manorama2"/&gt; The Himalayas extend from Jammu and Kashmir in the north to Arunachal Pradesh in the east. These states along with Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim lie mostly in the Himalayan region. Numerous Himalayan peaks rise over {{convert|7000|m|ft||abbr=on}} and the [[snow line]] ranges between {{convert|6000|m|ft||abbr=on}} in Sikkim to around {{convert|3000|m|ft||abbr=on}} in Kashmir. [[Kanchenjunga]]—on the [[Sikkim]]–[[Nepal]] border—is the highest point in the area administered by India. Most peaks in the Himalayas remain snowbound throughout the year. The Himalayas act as a barrier to the frigid [[katabatic wind]]s flowing down from Central Asia. Thus, North India is kept warm or only mildly cooled during winter; in summer, the same phenomenon makes India relatively hot.

*The [[Karakoram]] is situated in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. It has more than sixty peaks above {{convert|7000|m|ft||abbr=on}}, including [[K2 (mountain)|K2]], the second highest peak in the world {{convert|8611|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. K2 is just {{convert|237|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} smaller than the {{convert|8848|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Mount Everest]]. The range is about {{convert|500|km|mi||abbr=on}} in length and the most heavily [[glacier|glaciated]] part of the world outside of the polar regions. The [[Siachen Glacier]] at {{convert|76|km|mi||abbr=on}} and the [[Biafo Glacier]] at {{convert|67|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} rank as the world's second and third-longest glaciers outside the polar regions.&lt;ref name="Measurements"&gt;Measurements are from recent imagery, generally supplemented with Russian 1:200,000 scale topographic mapping as well as Jerzy Wala, ''Orographical Sketch Map: Karakoram: Sheets 1 &amp; 2'', Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Zurich, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Just to the west of the northwest end of the Karakoram, lies the [[Hindu Raj]] range, beyond which is the [[Hindu Kush]] range. The southern boundary of the Karakoram is formed by the [[Gilgit River|Gilgit]], [[Indus River|Indus]] and Shyok rivers, which separate the range from the northwestern end of the Himalayas.

*The [[Patkai]], or Purvanchal, are situated near India's eastern border with Burma. They were created by the same tectonic processes which led to the formation of the Himalayas. The physical features of the Patkai mountains are conical peaks, steep slopes and deep valleys. The Patkai ranges are not as rugged or tall as the Himalayas. There are three hill ranges that come under the Patkai: the Patkai–Bum, the [[Garo Hills|Garo]]–[[Khasi Hills|Khasi]]–[[Jaintia Hills|Jaintia]] and the [[Lushai hills]]. The Garo–Khasi range lies in Meghalaya. [[Mawsynram]], a village near [[Cherrapunji]] lying on the [[windward]] side of these hills, has the distinction of being the wettest place in the world, receiving the highest annual rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nios.ac.in/SecSoccour/English/Lesson07.pdf |format=PDF|title= Physical divisions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212061106/http://www.nios.ac.in/SecSoccour/English/Lesson07.pdf |archivedate=12 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Manduvalley1 coolspark.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vindhyas]] in central India]]

===The Peninsular Plateau===
*The [[Vindhya]] range runs across most of central India, extending {{convert|1050|km|mi||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="manorama2"/&gt; The average elevation of these hills is from {{convert|300|to|600|m|abbr=on}} and rarely goes above {{convert|700|m}}.&lt;ref name="manorama2"/&gt; They are believed to have been formed by the wastes created by the weathering of the ancient Aravali mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indian geographical journal|year=1971 |publisher=Indian Geographical Society |location= |isbn= |volume=46 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically, it separates [[North India|Northern]] India from [[South India|Southern]] India. The western end of the range lies in eastern Gujarat, near its border with Madhya Pradesh, and runs east and north, almost meeting the Ganges at [[Mirzapur]]
[[File:Dry deciduous Jungles at Ramatheertham 03.jpg|thumb|Dry deciduous and thorny forests of plateau regions in India]]

*The [[Malwa Plateau]] is spread across Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The average elevation of the Malwa plateau is 500 metres, and the landscape generally slopes towards the north. Most of the region is drained by the Chambal River and its tributaries; the western part is drained by the upper reaches of the [[Mahi River]].
*Kutch Kathiawar plateau
Kutch Kathiawar plateau is located in Gujarat state.

*The [[Deccan Plateau]] is a large triangular plateau, bounded by the Vindhyas to the north and flanked by the Eastern and Western Ghats. The Deccan covers a total area of 1.9 million&amp;nbsp;km² (735,000 mile²). It is mostly flat, with elevations ranging from {{convert|300|to|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The average elevation of the plateau is {{convert|2000|ft|m}} above sea level. The surface slopes from {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in the west to {{convert|1500|ft|m}} in the east.&lt;ref name="HSW"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Deccan Plateau|url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/asia/the-deccan-plateau.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It slopes gently from west to east and gives rise to several peninsular rivers such as the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], the [[Krishna River|Krishna]], the [[Kaveri]] and the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]] which drain into the Bay of Bengal. This region is mostly semi-arid as it lies on the leeward side of both Ghats. Much of the Deccan is covered by thorn scrub forest scattered with small regions of [[deciduous]] broadleaf forest. Climate in the Deccan ranges from hot summers to mild winters.
*The [[Chhota Nagpur Plateau]] is situated in eastern India, covering much of Jharkhand and adjacent parts of Odisha, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. Its total area is approximately {{convert|65000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and is made up of three smaller plateaus — the Ranchi, Hazaribagh, and Kodarma plateaus. The Ranchi plateau is the largest, with an average elevation of {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Much of the plateau is forested, covered by the [[Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forest|Chhota Nagpur dry deciduous forest]]s. Vast reserves of metal ores and [[coal]] have been found in the Chota Nagpur plateau. The [[Kathiawar]] peninsula in western Gujarat is bounded by the Gulf of Kutch and the Gulf of Khambat. The natural vegetation in most of the peninsula is [[xeric scrub]], part of the [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] ecoregion.
*The [[Satpura Range]] begins in eastern Gujarat near the Arabian Sea coast and runs east across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

[[File:Kalinagar Floods B.JPG|thumb|right|Many areas remain flooded during the heavy rains brought by [[monsoon]] in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]].]]
{{Main|Indo-Gangetic plain}}
The Indo-Gangetic &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEy6tcU6eLU|title=Geography Now! India|last=|first=|date=|website=Youtube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; plains, also known as the ''Great Plains'' are large [[alluvial plain]]s dominated by three main rivers, the [[Indus River|Indus]], [[Ganges River|Ganges]], and [[Brahmaputra]]. They run parallel to the Himalayas, from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the west to [[Assam]] in the east, and drain most of northern and eastern India. The plains encompass an area of {{convert|700000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The major rivers in this region are the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmaputra along with their main tributaries–[[Yamuna River|Yamuna]], [[Chambal River|Chambal]], [[Gomti River|Gomti]], [[Ghaghara River|Ghaghara]], [[Kosi River|Kosi]], [[Sutlej River|Sutlej]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]], and [[Tista River|Tista]]—as well as the rivers of the [[Ganges Delta]], such as the [[Meghna River|Meghna]].

The great plains are sometimes classified into four divisions:
* The [[Bhabar]] belt is adjacent to the foothills of the Himalayas and consists of boulders and pebbles which have been carried down by streams. As the [[porosity]] of this belt is very high, the streams flow underground. The Bhabar is generally narrow with its width varying between {{convert|6|to|15|km|abbr=on}}.
* The [[Tarai]] belt lies south of the adjacent Bhabar region and is composed of newer alluvium. The underground streams reappear in this region. The region is excessively moist and thickly forested. It also receives heavy rainfall throughout the year and is populated with a variety of wildlife.
* The '''Bangar''' belt consists of older alluvium and forms the alluvial terrace of the flood plains. In the Gangetic plains, it has a low upland covered by laterite deposits.
* The '''Khadar''' belt lies in lowland areas after the Bangar belt. It is made up of fresh newer alluvium which is deposited by the rivers flowing down the plain.

The '''Indo-Gangetic belt''' is the world's most extensive expanse of uninterrupted [[alluvium]] formed by the deposition of [[silt]] by the numerous rivers. The plains are flat making it conducive for [[irrigation]] through [[canal]]s. The area is also rich in [[ground water]] sources.The plains are one of the world's most [[intensive farming|intensely farmed]] areas. The main crops grown are [[rice]] and [[wheat]], which are grown in [[Crop rotation|rotation]]. Other important crops grown in the region include [[maize]], [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]]. The Indo-Gangetic plains rank among the world's most densely populated areas.

===Thar Desert===
[[File:Thar desert Rajasthan India.jpg|thumb|left|Thar desert, [[Rajasthan]]]]
{{Main|Thar Desert}}
The Thar Desert (also known as ''the deserts'') is by some calculations the world's seventh largest desert, by some others the tenth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml|title=The World's Largest Desert|publisher=geology.com|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms a significant portion of western India and covers an area of {{convert|200000|to|238700|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590028/Thar-Desert|title=Thar Desert|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desert continues into Pakistan as the [[Cholistan Desert]]. Most of the Thar Desert is situated in [[Rajasthan]], covering 61% of its geographic area.

About 10 percent of this region comprises sand dunes, and the remaining 90 percent consist of craggy rock forms, compacted salt-lake bottoms, and interdunal and fixed dune areas. Annual temperatures can range from {{convert|0|C}} in the winter to over {{convert|50|C}} during the summer. Most of the rainfall received in this region is associated with the short July–September southwest monsoon that brings {{convert|100|to|500|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation. Water is scarce and occurs at great depths, ranging from {{convert|30|to|120|m}} below the ground level.&lt;ref name="KAUL"&gt;{{cite book|title=Afforestation in Arid zones|author=Kaul, R.N.|publisher=N.V.

The soils of the arid region are generally sandy to sandy-loam in texture. The consistency and depth vary as per the topographical features. The low-lying loams are heavier may have a hard pan of clay, [[calcium carbonate]] or [[gypsum]].

In western India, the Kutch region in Gujarat and Koyna in Maharashtra are classified as a Zone IV region (high risk) for earthquakes. The Kutch city of [[Bhuj]] was the [[epicentre]] of the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake]], which claimed the lives of more than 1,337 people and injured 166,836 while destroying or damaging near a million homes.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web

The Western Coastal Plain is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, ranging from {{convert|50|to|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} in width. It extends from Gujarat in the north and extends through Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Kerala. Numerous rivers and backwaters inundate the region. Mostly originating in the Western Ghats, the rivers are fast-flowing, usually perennial, and empty into [[estuary|estuaries]]. Major rivers flowing into the sea are the Tapi, Narmada, [[Mandovi]] and [[Zuari]]. Vegetation is mostly deciduous, but the [[Malabar Coast moist forests]] constitute a unique ecoregion. The Western Coastal Plain can be divided into two parts, the [[Konkan]] and the [[Malabar Coast]].

The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, such floods have killed thousands of people and tend to cause displacements of people in such areas.

Major gulfs include the [[Gulf of Cambay]], [[Gulf of Kutch]], and the [[Gulf of Mannar]]. Straits include the [[Palk Strait]], which separates India from Sri Lanka; the [[Ten Degree Channel]], which separates the Andamans from the Nicobar Islands; 'and the Eight Degree Channel, which separates the Laccadive and Amindivi Islands from the Minicoy Island to the south.

India's [[wetland]] ecosystem is widely distributed from the cold and arid located in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, and those with the wet and humid climate of peninsular India. Most of the wetlands are directly or indirectly linked to river networks. The Indian government has identified a total of 71 wetlands for conservation and are part of sanctuaries and national parks.&lt;ref name="yearbook1"&gt;[[#Yearbook|India Yearbook]], p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; Mangrove forests are present all along the Indian coastline in sheltered estuaries, creeks, backwaters, salt marshes and mudflats.

Prominent mangrove covers are located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the [[Sundarbans]] delta, the [[Gulf of Kutch]] and the deltas of the Mahanadi, Godavari and Krishna rivers. Parts of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala also have large mangrove covers.&lt;ref name="manorama5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Manorama Yearbook 2006 ''(India – Environment)''|pages =580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sundarbans delta is home to the largest mangrove forest in the world. It lies at the mouth of the Ganges and spreads across areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. The Sundarbans is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], but is identified separately as the Sundarbans (Bangladesh) and the [[Sundarbans National Park]] (India). The Sundarbans are intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The area is known for its diverse fauna, being home to a large variety of species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes. Its most famous inhabitant is the [[Bengal tiger]]. It is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.

Geologic forces such as earthquakes resulted in the damming up of the region, turning it into a large saltwater lagoon. This area gradually filled with silt thus turning it into a seasonal salt marsh. During the monsoons, the area turn into a shallow marsh, often flooding to knee-depth. After the monsoons, the region turns dry and becomes parched.

{{Main|Climate of India|Climatic regions of India}}
Based on the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], India hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west, [[alpine tundra]] and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. The nation has four seasons: winter (January–February), summer (March–May), a monsoon (rainy) season (June–September) and a post-monsoon period (October–December)'.&lt;ref name="manorama4"/&gt;

The Himalayas act as a barrier to the frigid [[katabatic wind]]s flowing down from Central Asia.' Thus, North India is kept warm or only mildly cooled during winter; in summer, the same phenomenon makes India relatively hot. Although the [[Tropic of Cancer]]—the boundary between the tropics and subtropics—passes through the middle of India, the whole country is considered to be tropical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The rain-bearing [[monsoon]] clouds are attracted to the low-pressure system created by the Thar Desert. The southwest monsoon splits into two arms, the Bay of Bengal arm and the Arabian Sea arm. The Bay of Bengal arm moves northwards crossing northeast India in early June. The Arabian Sea arm moves northwards and deposits much of its rain on the windward side of Western Ghats. Winters in peninsula India see mild to warm days and cool nights. Further north the temperature is cooler. Temperatures in some parts of the Indian plains sometimes fall below freezing. Most of northern India is plagued by fog during this season. The highest temperature recorded in India was {{convert|51|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in Phalodi, Rajasthan. The lowest was {{convert|-45|°C|°F}} in Kashmir.

India's geological features are classified based on their era of formation.&lt;ref name="manorama6"/&gt; The [[Precambrian]] formations of Cudappah and Vindhyan systems are spread out over the eastern and southern states. A small part of this period is spread over western and central India.&lt;ref name="manorama6"/&gt; The [[Paleozoic]] formations from the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian system are found in the Western Himalaya region in Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.&lt;ref name="manorama6"/&gt; The [[Mesozoic]] [[Deccan Traps]] formation is seen over most of the northern Deccan; they are believed to be the result of [[subaerial|sub-aerial]] volcanic activity.&lt;ref name="manorama6"/&gt; The Trap soil is black in colour and conducive to agriculture. The Carboniferous system, Permian System and Triassic systems are seen in the western Himalayas. The Jurassic system is seen in the western Himalayas and Rajasthan.

'''[[Indonesia]]''' is an [[archipelago|archipelagic]] [[island country|country]] located in [[South east Asia|Southeast Asia]], lying between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is located in a strategic location astride or along major sea lanes connecting [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Indonesia's various regional cultures have been shaped&amp;mdash;although not specifically determined&amp;mdash;by centuries of complex interactions with its physical environment.

Indonesia is an archipelagic country extending about {{convert|5120|km|0}} from east to west and {{convert|1760|km|0}} from north to south.&lt;ref&gt;Kuoni - Far East, A world of difference. Page 88. Published 1999 by Kuoni Travel &amp; JPM Publications&lt;/ref&gt; According to a geospatial survey conducted between 2007 and 2010 by [[Badan Informasi Geospasial|National Coordinating Agency for Survey and Mapping]] (Bakosurtanal), Indonesia has 13,466 islands.&lt;ref name="NG-Indonesia-Island"&gt;{{cite news|  title = Hanya ada 13.466 Pulau di Indonesia| date = 8 February 2012 | work = National Geographic Indonesia | url=http://nationalgeographic.co.id/berita/2012/02/hanya-ada-13466-pulau-di-indonesia | language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier survey conducted in 2002 by [[National Institute of Aeronautics and Space]] (LAPAN) stated Indonesia has 18,307 islands. According to the CIA World Factbook, there are 17,508 islands.&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html CIA World Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy between the surveys is likely caused by the earlier different survey method including [[tide|tidal]] islands, sandy [[cay]]s and rocky [[reef]]s that surface during low tide and submerge during high tide. There are 8,844 named islands according to estimates made by the [[Politics of Indonesia|government of Indonesia]], with 922 of those are permanently inhabited.&lt;ref&gt;Based on "''Seminar Nasional Penetapan Nama Pulau-pulau Kecil Dalam Presektif Sejarah'' or "National Seminary of Name For Little Islands From History Side", 16 to 18 July 2008 at [[Palembang]], '''South Sumatra''', '''[[Indonesia]]'''&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises five main islands: [[Sumatra]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Borneo]] (known as ''[[Kalimantan]]'' in Indonesia), [[Sulawesi]], and [[New Guinea]]; two major island groups ([[Nusa Tenggara]] and the [[Maluku Islands]]) and sixty smaller island groups. Four of the islands are shared with other countries: Borneo is shared with [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]; [[Sebatik]], located off the northeastern coast of Kalimantan, shared with Malaysia; [[Timor]] is shared with [[East Timor]]; and the newly divided provinces of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] share the island of [[New Guinea]] with [[Papua New Guinea]].

Indonesia has total land area of {{convert|1,904,569|km2|0}}, Including {{convert|93000|km2|0}} of inland seas ([[straits]], [[bay]]s, and other bodies of water). The additional surrounding sea areas bring Indonesia's generally recognised territory (land and sea) to about 5 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The government, however, also claims an exclusive economic zone, which brings the total area to about 7.9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=E5NafsG5RiEC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Indonesia+land+sea+total+area&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwnqTcm4nZAhUlR48KHbGUApwQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Indonesia%20land%20sea%20total%20area&amp;f=false|title=Prevention and Compensation of Marine Pollution Damage: Recent Developments in Europe, China and the US|last=Faure|first=Michael G.|date=2006|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041123381|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=6dgmXWMgWcwC&amp;pg=PR32&amp;dq=Indonesia+total+sea+area&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8tLiVnInZAhWJK48KHfz3CZ8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Indonesia%20total%20sea%20area&amp;f=false|title=Indonesia: A Country Study|last=Frederick|first=William H.|last2=Worden|first2=Robert L.|date=2011|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780844407906|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Geology of Indonesia}}[[File:Plate setting Sunda megathrust.png|thumb|330x330px|The tectonic plates &amp; movements under Indonesia|left]]The main islands of Sumatra, Java, Madura, and Kalimantan lie on the [[Sunda Plate]] and geographers have conventionally grouped them, (along with Sulawesi), as the [[Greater Sunda Islands]]. At Indonesia's eastern extremity is western New Guinea, which lies on the [[Australian Plate]]. Sea depths in the Sunda and Sahul shelves average {{convert|300|m|0}} or less. Between these two shelves lie Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara (also known as the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]), and the [[Maluku Islands]] (or the Moluccas), which form a second island group with deep, surrounding seas down to {{convert|4500|m|0}} in depth. The term "Outer Islands" is used inconsistently by various writers but it is usually taken to mean those islands other than Java and Madura.

Sulawesi is an island lies on three separate plates, the [[Banda Sea Plate]], [[Molucca Sea Plate]], and Sunda Plate. Seismic and volcanic activities are high on its northeastern part, evidenced by the formation of volcanoes in [[North Sulawesi]] and island arcs such as the [[Sangihe Islands|Sangihe]] and [[Talaud Islands]], southwest of the [[Philippine Trench]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=eilFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT190&amp;dq=Mindanao+North+Sulawesi+Arc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiF66j9sq3ZAhUHR48KHcg0BfwQ6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mindanao%20North%20Sulawesi%20Arc&amp;f=false|title=Mountains: The origins of the Earth's mountain systems|last=Park|first=Graham|date=2018-01-03|publisher=Dunedin Academic Press|isbn=9781780465791|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=S68JAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=North+Sulawesi+tectonics&amp;dq=North+Sulawesi+tectonics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic9ae-s63ZAhVKL48KHdFxAXEQ6AEIQDAE|title=The Geology and Tectonics of Eastern Indonesia: Proceedings of the Ccop-Ioc Seatar Working Group Meeting, Bandung, Indonesia, 9-14 July 1979|last=Wiryosujono|first=S.|date=1981|publisher=Pergamon Press|isbn=9780080287324|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=FyQUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sangihe+Talaud+Philippine+Trench&amp;dq=Sangihe+Talaud+Philippine+Trench&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU6NXLs63ZAhWFwI8KHQz-AbwQ6AEIVDAI|title=Tectonic Evolution of Southeast Asia|last=Hall|first=Robert|last2=Blundell|first2=Derek John|date=1996|publisher=Geological Society|isbn=9781897799529|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nusa Tenggara or Lesser Sunda Islands consists of two strings of islands stretching eastward from Bali toward southern Maluku. The inner arc of Nusa Tenggara is a continuation of the [[Alpide belt]] chain of mountains and volcanoes extending from Sumatra through Java, Bali, and Flores, and trailing off in the volcanic [[Banda Islands]], which along with the [[Kai Islands]] and the [[Tanimbar Islands]] and other small islands in the [[Banda Sea]] are typical examples of the [[Wallacea]] mixture of Asian and Australasian plant and animal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0102|name=Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests}}. Worldwildlife.org. Retrieved on 29 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The outer arc of Nusa Tenggara is a geological extension of the chain of islands west of Sumatra that includes Nias, Mentawai, and Enggano. This chain resurfaces in Nusa Tenggara in the ruggedly mountainous islands of Sumba and Timor.

The Maluku Islands (or Moluccas) are geologically among the most complex of the Indonesian islands, consisted of four different tectonic plates. They are located in the northeast sector of the archipelago, bounded by the Philippine Sea to the north, Papua to the east, and Nusa Tenggara to the southwest. The largest of these islands include [[Halmahera]], [[Seram]] and [[Buru]], all of which rise steeply out of very deep seas and have unique Wallacea vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0104|name=Terrestrial Ecoregions - Buru rain forests (AA0104)}}.

== Time zones ==
{{main article|Time in Indonesia}}

Indonesia is divided into three [[time zone]]s: 
*'''Western Indonesian Time/WIT''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Waktu Indonesia Barat''/'''WIB''') ([[UTC+07:00|UTC+7]])
**WIB is observed in islands of [[Sumatra]], [[Java (island)|Java]], provinces of [[West Kalimantan]] and [[Central Kalimantan]]
*'''Central Indonesian Time/CIT''' (''Waktu Indonesia Tengah''/'''WITA''') ([[UTC+08:00|UTC+8]])
**WITA is observed in islands of [[Sulawesi]], [[Bali]], provinces of [[East Nusa Tenggara]], [[West Nusa Tenggara]], [[East Kalimantan]] and [[South Kalimantan]]
*'''Eastern Indonesian Time/EIT''' (''Waktu Indonesia Timur''/'''WIT''') ([[UTC+09:00|UTC+9]]).
**WIT is observed in provinces of [[Maluku (Indonesian province)|Maluku]], [[North Maluku]], [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]].

== Climate ==
{{main article|Climate of Indonesia}}
[[File:Indonesia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|400px|A map of Indonesia's [[Köppen climate classification]].]]
Lying along the equator, Indonesia's climate tends to be relatively even year-round. Indonesia has two seasons&amp;mdash;a wet season and a dry season&amp;mdash;with no extremes of summer or winter. For most of Indonesia, the dry season falls between April and October with the wet season between November and March.

Some regions, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra, experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season, and floods in the wet. Rainfall in Indonesia is plentiful, particularly in west Sumatra, northwest Kalimantan, west Java, and western New Guinea.

Parts of Sulawesi and some islands closer to Australia, such as [[Sumba]] and [[Timor]], are drier, however, these are exceptions. The almost uniformly warm waters that make up 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that temperatures on land remain fairly constant. The coastal plains averaging {{convert|28|°C|1}}, the inland and mountain areas averaging {{convert|26|°C|1}}, and the higher mountain regions, {{convert|23|°C|1}}. The area's relative humidity ranges between 70 and 90%.

Winds are moderate and generally predictable, with [[monsoon]]s usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through March. [[Typhoon]]s and large scale storms pose little hazard to mariners in Indonesia waters; the major danger comes from swift currents in channels, such as the [[Lombok Strait|Lombok]] and [[Sape Strait|Sape]] straits.

Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found in every major island of Indonesia, followed by the tropical monsoon climate that predominantly lies along Java's coastal north, Sulawesi's coastal south and east, and Bali, and finally the tropical savanna climate, found in isolated locations of Central Java, lowland East Java, coastal southern Papua and smaller islands to the east of Lombok.

However, cooler climate types do exist in mountainous regions of Indonesia 1300–1500 metres above sea level. The oceanic climate (Köppen ''Cfb'') prevail in highland areas with fairly uniform precipitation year-round, adjacent to rainforest climates, while the subtropical highland climate (Köppen ''Cwb'') exist in highland areas with a more pronounced dry season, adjacent to tropical monsoon and savanna climates.

Above 3000 metres is where cold, subpolar climates dominate and where frost and occasional snow become more commonplace. The subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen ''Cfc''), existing between 3000 and 3500 metres, can be found on the mountain slopes of Indonesia's highest peaks, and serves as a transition between oceanic climates and tundra climates. Tundra climates (Köppen ''ET''), are found anywhere above 3500 metres on the highest peaks of Indonesia, including the permanently snow-capped peaks in Papua. In this climate regime, average monthly temperatures are all below 10&amp;nbsp;°C, and monthly precipitation is uniform.

==Environmental issues==
{{main article|Environmental issues in Indonesia}}

[[File:Riau palm oil 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|Deforestation in Riau province, Sumatra, to make way for an [[oil palm]] plantation, 2007.]]
Indonesia's high population and rapid industrialisation present serious [[Environmental issues in Indonesia|environmental issues]], which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.&lt;ref name="forestprob"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jason R. Miller |title=Deforestation in Indonesia and the Orangutan Population |publisher=TED Case Studies |date=30 January 1997 |url=http://www.american.edu/TED/orang.htm |accessdate=14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues include [[Deforestation in Indonesia|large-scale deforestation]] (much of it [[illegal logging|illegal]]) and related wildfires causing [[Smog#Southeast Asia|heavy smog]] over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; over-exploitation of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid [[urbanisation]] and [[economic development]], including [[air pollution]], [[traffic congestion]], garbage management, and reliable water and [[Wastewater|waste water]] services.&lt;ref name="forestprob" /&gt;

In 1970, 15% of Indonesians lived in cities compared to over 30% today, and this increases pressure on the urban environment. Industrial pollution is increasing, particularly in Java, and the increasing affluence of the growing middle class drives a rapid increase in the number of motor vehicles and associated emissions. Garbage and waste water services are being placed under increasing pressure. Reliance on septic systems or effluent disposal in open canals and [[List of rivers of Indonesia|river systems]] remains the norm, and is a major polluter of water resources. Very few Indonesians have access to safe drinking water and must boil water before use.

The geographical resources of the Indonesian archipelago have been exploited in ways that fall into consistent social and historical patterns. One cultural pattern consists of the formerly Indianized, rice-growing peasants in the valleys and plains of Sumatra, Java, and Bali, another cultural complex is composed of the largely Islamic coastal commercial sector, a third, more marginal sector consists of the upland forest farming communities which exist by means of subsistence swidden agriculture. To some degree, these patterns can be linked to the geographical resources themselves, with abundant shoreline, generally calm seas, and steady winds favouring the use of sailing vessels, and fertile valleys and plains&amp;mdash;at least in the Greater Sunda Islands&amp;mdash;permitting irrigated rice farming. The heavily forested, mountainous interior hinders overland communication by road or river, but fosters slash-and-burn agriculture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15737">The '''geology of [[Italy]]''' includes some of the only active volcanoes in Europe and mountain ranges such as the [[Apennines]], [[Alps]] and [[Dolomites]] formed from the uplift of igneous and primarily marine sedimentary rocks, all formed since the [[Paleozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Moores, E.M.|author2=Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=415–420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
The oldest rocks in Italy may include oceanic crust subducted during the [[Caledonian orogeny]] and 440&amp;nbsp;million year old [[Ordovician]] granites. Only detrital [[zircons]] in the Alps date to the [[Precambrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Latest Precambrian to Early Cambrian U–Pb zircon ages of augen gneisses from Calabria (Italy), with inference to the Alboran microplate in the evolution of the peri-Gondwana terranes|first1=Francesca|last1=Micheletti|first2=Pierre|last2=Barbey|first3=Annamaria|last3=Fornelli|first4=Giuseppe|last4=Piccarreta|first5=Etienne|last5=Deloule|date=25 November 2006|journal=International Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=96|issue=5|pages=843–860|doi=10.1007/s00531-006-0136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These granites are located offshore of [[Venice]], found in the Agip Assunta well and deformed, transforming into [[orthogneiss]] during the [[Hercynian orogeny]]. Overall, Italian [[Paleozoic]] rocks commonly show evidence of the Hercynian orogeny in the Peloritani Mountains in Sicily, [[Calabria]], the Alps, [[Sardinia]] and the Tuscan [[Apuane Alps]].

The Hercynian orogeny produced a large thrust belt, thickened the crust and led to polyphaser metamorphism yielding rocks such as [[gneiss]], [[phyllite]] and [[amphibolite]]. [[Metamorphic facies]] range from high-pressure [[kyanite]] to low-pressure [[andalusite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The hercynian chain in Sardinia (Italy)|first1=Luigi|last1=Carmignani|first2=Rodolfo|last2=Carosi|first3=Anselmo|last3=Di Pisa|first4=Marco|last4=Gattiglio|first5=Giovanni|last5=Musumeci|first6=Giacomo|last6=Oggiano|first7=Pier|last7=Carlo Pertusati|date=1 January 1994|journal=Geodinamica Acta|volume=7|issue=1|pages=31–47|doi=10.1080/09853111.1994.11105257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Alps at [[Mont Blanc]] and Mont Rosa, the [[Southern Alps]] at Braveno, [[Brixen]], [[Cima d'Asta]], Doss del Sabion and the [[Barbagia]] and [[Gallura]] granites in Sardinia are all examples of [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] granite [[pluton]] and [[batholith]] intrusions. [[Ignimbrite]] eruptions had an important role at the same time in forming parts of the central Southern Alps. Sedimentary rocks from before the Permian have remained intact and unmetamorphosed (or only having experienced low-grade metamorphism) in the Paleocarnian [[charn]] of the eastern Southern Alps. The [[metamorphic grade]] increases to the west, reaching [[amphibolite]] grade in the Orobic Alps and [[granulite]] grade in the [[Ivrea]]-[[Verbano]] Zone. Most of the basement rocks in the [[Dolomites]] are [[phyllite]] or gneiss at [[greenschist]] grade. Within the Dioritic-Kinzigitic unit, [[biotite]] and [[sillimanite]]-rich gneiss outcrop in Calabria.

At the same time in the Permian and Carboniferous, the opening of the west branch of the [[Tethys Ocean]] reoriented sections of Italy atop the [[Adriatic Plate]] and created the Ligure-Piemontese ocean basin, leading to widespread deposition of carbonates, evaporites and [[red beds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://arpi.unipi.it/handle/11568/111728|title=The architecture of the Jurassic Ligure-Piemontese oceanic basin: tentative reconstruction along the Northern Apennine - Alpine Corsica transect|last1=Marroni|first1=Michele|last2=Pandolfi|first2=Luca|date=2 November 2018|publisher=|volume=96|pages=1059–1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units such as the Valgardena Sandstone emplaced during a westward marine transgression in areas later uplifted as the Alps. These sandstones were succeeded by [[sabkha]], the lagoonal Bellerophon Formation, volcanic rocks, the [[Werfen Formation]] and Servino Formation. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=415-418}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
Even in the 19th century, geologists recognized [[Ladinian]] and [[Carnian]] age carbonate platforms in the [[Dolomites]] that likely formed as coral atolls. Throughout the early [[Triassic]], the [[Zorzino Limestone]], Rhaetian Choncodon Dolomite, [[Riva di Solto]] Shale and Zu Limestone filled the Lombard Basin. Up to two kilometers of carbonates assembled in the late Triassic as the [[Dolomia Principale]]. Meanwhile, the Lagonegro Basin accumulated limestone, chert and marl into the [[Jurassic]]. Complex tectonics produced [[horst and graben]] features and some lowlands deposited evaporites, such as the Burano Anhydrite—now a significant unit in the [[Apennine Mountains]].

Jurassic tectonic conditions differed somewhat from the Triassic, resulting in new basin formation and a carbonate depositional environment akin to the current day Florida-Bahamas platform. Southern Alps basins such as the Lombard Basin and the Belluno Basin gathered marl and limestone, while [[turbidite]] and nodular limestone was more common in the Vajont Limestone, Fonzaso Formation and Selcifero Lombardo. In addition to wide shelf environments like the Bahamas, seamounts like the Trento Swell or the Sicilian Iblean and Saccense zones, some basins such as the Piemontese Basin, the Lagonegro Basin and the Ligurian-western Tuscan Ligure Basin were situated above [[ophiolite]] and ended up with abundant [[radiolarite]] fossils in limestone.

During the [[Cretaceous]], global high sea levels and local tectonic conditions produced a greater share of basins than platform environments (although the Campano-Lucana, [[Friuli]], [[Apulia]] and Latium-Abruzzi platforms persisted). More [[pelagic]], open water sediments like marl joined [[breccia]] and underwater debris flows. Triassic conditions persisted in only one location in Sardinia where up to one kilometer of carbonates finished depositing in the Cretaceous, atop deformed Cambrian-Carboniferous metamorphic basement rock.
Changing interaction between the [[European Plate]] and the Adriatic Plate resulted in tectonic compression along the Adriatic Plate's northern margin, kicking off the formation of the Alps and the Apennines. In the late Cretaceous, foredeeps filled with [[flysch]] and [[molasse]] sediments shed off the rising mountains. Examples include the Bergamo Flysch within the Lombard Basin of the Southern Alps. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=418-419}}

The Mesozoic was largely quiescent in terms of [[magmatism]], but some igneous activity did take place. Pietra Verde sandstones from the [[Ladinian]] in the Southern Alps contain [[calc-alkaline rock]] while granite, [[shoshonite]] and [[monzonite]] intruded the Dolomites region into the [[Carnian]]. In fact, subsurface rocks in the [[Po Valley]], the Lagonegro Basin, west [[Trentino]], the Venetian foothills, Sicily, Lombary and the northern Apennines show signs of [[volcaniclastic]] sediments and [[pillow lava]] from the time period.

Although the oceanic crust of the Tethys Ocean has been recycled into the mantle, sections of it remain as ophiolite with [[peridotite]], [[gabbro]], [[prasinite]], [[serpentinite]] and pillow lava of Jurassic to Cretaceous age in [[Liguria]], [[Tuscany]], [[Val d'Aosta]] and [[Piemonte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X9800185X|title=Isotopic contrasts within the Internal Liguride ophiolite (N.

The Ragusa Basin in the Iblean Plateau of Sicily had magmatism in the Jurassic, together with the Trapanese Basin, followed by Cretaceous activity in the [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]] area. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=420}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
Around 60&amp;nbsp;million years ago in the [[Paleocene]], alkali basalt dikes penetrated areas in the Dolomites. [[Basalt]] and volcaniclastic rocks also erupted in the Lessini Mountains, together with [[syenite]] and [[trachyte]] latholiths.

In the Eocene, the Apennine Mountains continued forming. The foothills in Friuli and the Venice-area are remnants of Eocene age flysch shed off the [[Dinaric Alps]]. Throughout the [[Paleogene]], the same region witnessed both shale and carbonate formation in shallow water areas away from the Dinarides thrust belt. Paleontologists have gathered extensive fish fossils from the period out of the [[Bolca]] quarry close to [[Verona]].

Alpine uplift spurred [[tonalite]], [[granodiorite]], [[syenite]] and [[monzonite]] emplacement as [[batholiths]] and [[plutons]], lasting into the [[Oligocene]], as well as [[basaltic andesite]] intrusions. The Insubric Lineament sheared the Bregaglia batholith.

Throughout the Oligocene, a subduction zone—dipping to the west—formed to the east of [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]] and the Alpine belt. Ionian Basin and Adriatic Plate sediments accreted onto the Apennine area as the region migrated to the northeast, spread eastward and to the south. Tectonic evolution of the Southern Alps shifted the foredeep further south, accumulating the Gonfolite Lombarda as well as the Molassa Bellunese in the [[Miocene]]. The Gessosso-Solfifera Formation contains evaporites surrounding the Apennines left by the [[Messinian salinity crisis]].&lt;ref name="pierocasero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pierocasero.it/dowload/V-Tectonics%20and%20Sedimentation%20in%20the%20Central%20Apennines.pdf|date=2008-05-22|title=Tectonics And Sedimentation In The Central Apennines|author1=Emily Albouy|author2=Piero Casero|author3=Remi Eschard|author4=Jean-Luc Rudkiewicz |accessdate=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bracco Nappe is part of the primarily oceanic rocks of the Ligurian Basin on the western edge of the Apennines. To the east of the Ligurian Basin is the Umbro-Marigiano Basin, which contains the Tuscan Zone—a carbonate platform sequence ending in the [[Early Jurassic|Liassic]] with younger pelagic sediments. The Latium-Abruzzi Platform is to the southeast.

During the [[Neogene]], Apennine foredeeps, such as Central Apeninnic Foredeep migrated to the east into [[Pleistocene]] times with continued flysch deposition. Basins that emerged at the period include the Cervarola, Camerino, Laga, Cellino, Macigno and Marnoso-Arenacea.

The Cretaceous to Miocene aged Cilento Flysch, Flysch Rosso and Frido Flysch contain shale, sandstone and conglomerate and are associated with [[ophiolite]], offering evidence of the deformational history during that time span in the southern Apennines. The Numidian Flysch contains quartz and [[arenite]] sands likely deposited by a river delta from Africa and overlain by the coarser Goroglione Flysch. Both date to the Miocene.

Uplift continues today and since the Pleistocene, Calabrian sedimentary rocks have uplifted more than one kilometer. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=419-420}}

Prior to current volcanism in southern Italy, seamount volcanoes were active in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] during the [[Pliocene]] and Pleistocene, as well as on-land volcanism in Tuscany and Campania (following the course of an Apennine graben). The islands of [[Elbe]], Gavorrono, [[Stromboli]] and others formed due to eruptions atop oceanic crust from nine million to 180,000 years ago. One offshore eruption in 1891 generated the short-lived island of [[Ferdinandea]] which quickly eroded below the water, remaining as the [[Graham Bank]]. [[Mount Etna]] tends toward less explosive basaltic eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Volcanism of the southern Tyrrhenian Sea and its geodynamic implications|first1=F.|last1=Barberi|first2=P.|last2=Gasparini|first3=F.|last3=Innocenti|first4=L.|last4=Villari|date=10 August 1973|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=78|issue=23|pages=5221–5232|doi=10.1029/jb078i023p05221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Petroleum exploration in Italy began in the late 19th century and resulted in the discovery of the Caviaga gas field close to Milan in 1944. Apennine folding has created structural traps in Pliocene sand reservoirs in the Bradanic Trough, Adriatic Sea and beneath the Po Plain. In between Brescia and Milan, the stratigraphic traps are formed at the base of Pliocene transgressive rocks and then migrated into Neogene clastic rocks that were experiencing more intense tectonic activity. In some places, organic matter in Miocene flysch may have been the original source of hydrocarbon. Off of eastern Calabria (Crotone), offshore of Trapani in western Sicily and in [[Gagliano Castelferrato|Gagliano]], northeast Sicily are flysch-derived gas condensate reservoirs.

[[Liassic]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} and Triassic age carbonates and reservoirs offshore in the south Adriatic or onshore at [[Irpinia]] are hosted in Triassic dolomites. Extremely deep production more than five kilometers deep takes place east of Milan in the Malossa Field. The eastern Sicilian Gela and Ragusa oil fields are also particularly deep.

In spite of extensive extraction after World War II, Italy still retains oil and gas resources. Production rose from 13.8&amp;nbsp;million cubic meters of gas in 1984 and 2.2&amp;nbsp;million tons of oil to 17.4&amp;nbsp;billion cubic meters and 4.3&amp;nbsp;million tons of oil by 1991, and new reserves were sound in Italy between 1992 and 1993.

Italy has extensive [[lignite]] coal from the Eocene, concentrated in Sardinia. However, extraction is limited by thin seams and complicated tectonics. Graphite [[anthracite]] is known in Carboniferous Val d'Aosta rocks and the Permian rocks of Sardinia. Both Calabria and central Italy have peat deposits from the Paleogene.

Because of the extent of mining throughout Italy's history, from Roman times to the present, many of the country's generally small mineral deposits have already been depleted. The country has small deposits of [[lead]], [[sulfur]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[silver]], [[fluorite]], [[barite]], [[strontium]], [[aluminum]], [[gold]], [[beryl]], [[molybdenum]], [[tin]], [[uranium]], [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[chromium]], [[titanium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[astatine]]. [[Quartz]], [[salt]], [[feldspar]], [[asbestos]], [[talc]], [[magnesite]], [[graphite]], [[leucite]], [[bentonite]] and [[perlite]] are all extracted for industrial purposes. Historically, Italy had silver-zinc-lead mines in Monte Neve, Raibl (in the Eastern Alps), and Sardinia, mercury in north Amiata, Tuscany, fluorite and antimony in Sardinia and [[pyrite]] in Tuscany. Elba, Cogne in the Val d'Aosta valley and the Nurra Province of Sardinia all had historical iron mining. Campania and Puglia produced [[bauxite]], the Western Alps asbestos and talc, Liguria and Sardinia [[manganese]], [[nickel]] in Piemonte and copper in Val d'Aosta.

Sicily remains active as a producer of sulfur and potassium salts and aluminum production has shifted into leucitic lavas in the center of the country. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=430-434}}

'''ISO 3166-2:AM''' is the entry for [[Armenia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Armenia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[provinces of Armenia|1 city and 10 regions]]. The city [[Yerevan]] is the capital of the country and has special status equal to the regions.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|AM}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Armenia. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

In [[List of military time zones|military and aviation time]] IST is designated '''E*''' ("Echo-Star").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/info/timezone.htm |title= Military and Civilian Time Designations |accessdate= 2006-12-02 |work=Greenwich Mean Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Standard Time is calculated on the basis of 82.5' E [[longitude]], in [[Mirzapur]] (Amravati Chauraha), Uttar Pradesh, which is nearly on the corresponding longitude reference line.&lt;ref name="two-timing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorial-views-on/Edits/Two-timing-India/Article1-246310.aspx|title=Two-timing India|date=2007-09-04|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=2012-09-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509095810/http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorial-views-on/Edits/Two-timing-India/Article1-246310.aspx|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Time in India}}

After [[Indian independence movement|independence in 1947]], the Indian government established IST as the official time for the whole country, although [[Kolkata]] and [[Mumbai]] retained their own local time (known as [[Calcutta Time]] and [[Bombay Time]]) until 1948 and 1955, respectively.&lt;ref name="Princely states"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-misc.html |title=Odds and Ends |accessdate=2006-11-25 |publisher=[[Indian Railways Fan Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central observatory was moved from [[Chennai]] to a location at Shankargarh Fort in [[Allahabad district]], so that it would be as close to UTC +5:30 as possible.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Daylight Saving Time (DST) was used briefly during the [[Sino-Indian War|China–Indian War of 1962]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|Indo–Pakistani Wars of 1965]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]].&lt;ref name="timez"&gt;{{cite web |url =http://wwp.india-time.com/indian-time-zones.htm |title =India Time Zones |accessdate =2006-11-25 |work =Greenwich Mean Time |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070519085807/http://wwp.india-time.com/indian-time-zones.htm |archivedate =19 May 2007 |df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and proposals==
The country's east–west distance of more than {{convert|2,933|km|mi}} covers over 29 degrees of longitude, resulting in the sun rising and setting almost two hours earlier on India's eastern border than in the [[Rann of Kutch]] in the far west. Inhabitants of the [[Northeast India|northeastern states]] have to advance their clocks with the early sunrise and avoid the extra consumption of energy after daylight hours.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1501252.stm |title=India investigates different time zones|accessdate=2006-11-25 |last=Sen |first=Ayanjit |date=2001-08-21 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, a team of researchers proposed separating the country into two or three time zones to conserve energy. The binary system that they suggested involved a return to British–era time zones; the recommendations were not adopted.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/01/07/stories/2002010700130300.htm |title=A matter of time |accessdate=2006-11-25 |last=S. Muthiah |date=2012-09-24 |work=[[The Hindu]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the government established a four–member committee under the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Ministry of Science and Technology]] to examine the need for multiple time zones and daylight saving.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The findings of the committee, which were presented to [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 2004 by the Minister for Science and Technology, [[Kapil Sibal]], did not recommend changes to the unified system, stating that "the prime meridian was chosen with reference to a central station, and that the expanse of the Indian State was not large."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dst.gov.in/admin_finance/un-sq1007.htm |title=Standard Time for Different Regions |accessdate=2006-11-25 |date=2004-07-22 |work=Department of Science and Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010543/http://dst.gov.in/admin_finance/un-sq1007.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the government has consistently refused to split the country into multiple time zones, provisions in labour laws such as the ''Plantations Labour Act, 1951'' allow the Central and State governments to define and set the local time for a particular industrial area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nrcw.nic.in/shared/sublinkimages/19.htm |title=A matter of time |accessdate=2006-11-25 |work=National Resource Centre for Women |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319181936/http://nrcw.nic.in/shared/sublinkimages/19.htm |archivedate=19 March 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Assam]], tea gardens follow a separate time zone, known as the ''Chaibagaan'' or ''Bagan'' time ('Tea Garden Time'), which is one hour ahead of IST.&lt;ref name="HindustanTimes2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/Change-clock-to-bagantime/Article1-304181.aspx |title=Change clock to bagantime |accessdate=2008-09-22 |last=Rahul Karmakar |date=2012-09-24 |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606065730/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/india/Change-clock-to-bagantime/Article1-304181.aspx |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still Indian Standard Time remains the only officially used time.

The filmmaker [[Jahnu Barua]] has been campaigning for a separate time zone (daylight saving time) for the past 25 years. In 2010, he suggested creating a separate time zone for the Development of Northeastern Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gogoi-for-separate-time-zone-for-Assam/articleshow/28252502.cms?referral=PM|title=Gogoi for separate time zone for Assam - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, Chief Minister of Assam [[Tarun Gogoi]] started campaigning for another time zone for [[Assam]] and other [[northeast India|northeastern states]] of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/india-could-get-second-time-zone-with-assam-one-hour-ahead-466326?curl=1388743528|title=India could get second time zone with Assam one hour ahead|website=ndtv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposal would need to be cleared by the Central Government of India.

In June 2017, [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DST) indicated that they are once again studying feasibility of two time-zones for India. Proposals for creating an additional Eastern India Time (EIT at UTC+6:00), shifting default IST to UTC+5:00 and Daylight saving (Indian Daylight Time for IST and Eastern India Daylight Time for EIT) starting on 14th April (Ambedkar Jayanti) and ending on 2nd October (Gandhi Jayanti) was submitted to DST for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/government-assessing-feasibility-of-different-time-zones-in-india/articleshow/59268686.cms|title=Government assessing feasibility of different time zones in India|date=2017-06-22|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time signals==
Official time signals are generated by the [[Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory]] at the National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi, for both commercial and official use. The signals are based on [[atomic clock]]s and are synchronised with the worldwide system of clocks that support the [[Coordinated Universal Time]].

Features of the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory include:
*[[High frequency]] broadcast service operating at 10&amp;nbsp;MHz under call sign ''ATA'' to synchronise the user clock within a millisecond;
*[[Indian National Satellite System]] satellite-based standard time and frequency broadcast service, which offers IST correct to ±10 microsecond and frequency calibration of up to ±10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;; and
*Time and frequency calibrations made with the help of [[picosecond|pico-]] and [[nanosecond]]s time interval [[frequency counter]]s and [[phase (waves)|phase]] recorders. 

IST is taken as the standard time as it passes through almost the centre of India. To communicate the exact time to the people, the exact time is broadcast over the national [[All India Radio]] and [[Doordarshan]] television network. Telephone companies have dedicated phone numbers connected to mirror [[time server]]s that also relay the precise time. Another increasingly popular means of obtaining the time is through [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=19703 |title=Satellites for Navigation |accessdate=2006-11-25 |work=Press Information Bureau, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''legal drinking age''' is the age at which a person can [[legally]] consume [[alcoholic beverage]]s. These laws cover a wide range of issues and behaviors, addressing when and where alcohol can be consumed. The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. These laws vary between different countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to [[Drinking in public|drinking alcohol in public places]] with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (an exception being the UK, which has a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places).  Some countries also have different age limits for different [[List of alcoholic drinks|types of alcoholic drinks]].&lt;ref name="Icap Reports 4"&gt;[http://www.icap.org/portals/0/download/all_pdfs/icap_reports_english/report4.pdf Drinking Age Limits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120062253/http://www.icap.org/portals/0/download/all_pdfs/icap_reports_english/report4.pdf |date=2013-01-20 }} - International Center for Alcohol Policies&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Paraguay, Solomon Islands, India (certain states), the United States (except U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico), Yemen (Aden and Sana'a), Japan, Iceland, Canada (certain Provinces and Territories), and South Korea have the highest set drinking ages; however, some of these countries do not have off-premises drinking limits. Austria, Antigua and Barbuda, Belgium, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cuba, Ethiopia, Gibraltar, Luxembourg and Nicaragua have the lowest set drinking ages.{{synth|date=October 2018}}

The most commonly known reason for the law behind the legal drinking age is the [[Long-term impact of alcohol on the brain|effect on the brain]] in adolescents. Since the brain is still maturing, alcohol can have a [[Effects of alcohol on memory|negative effect on the memory]] and long-term thinking.

The most common minimum age to purchase alcohol in Africa is 18. Although it varies from the lowest age limit in Ethiopia being only 15 years, Zimbabwe with a minimum purchase age of 16 years, The Gambia with an age limit of 17 years, and Uganda where the minimum legal purchase age is 18 but minors aged 16 or 17 may consume a glass of beer, wine or cider with a meal at a restaurant. Cameroon and Egypt are the only countries in Africa with a minimum purchase age of 21 years. However Algeria, Angola (except Luando Province), Central African Republic, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Togo, Tunisia and the Western Sahara have no laws on the book restricting the sale of alcohol to minors. In Libya, Somalia and Sudan the sale, production and consumption of alcohol is completely prohibited.{{synth|date=October 2018}}

The minimum age to purchase and consume varies, but the most common age is 18 years. However, in [[North America]] the age limits varies between 18 and 21 years of age. Throughout the [[United States]] the minimum legal age to purchase any alcoholic beverage from a shop, supermarket, liquor store, bar, club or any other licensed premises is 21 years of age.  In [[Canada]] each province can decide which minimum age limit is to be set to buy or consume alcohol. Most provinces have a minimum age of 19 years, while [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Quebec]] have set a minimum age of 18 years. In [[South America]] all countries have set a minimum purchase age of 18 years, except for [[Guyana]] where minors aged 16 or 17 may consume a glass of beer, wine or cider in a restaurant provided they buy a meal, and [[Paraguay]] the only country with a minimum legal purchase and drinking age of 20 years.

| The [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984]] withholds revenue from states that allow the purchase of alcohol by anyone under the age of 21. Prior to the effective date of that Act, the [[U.S. history of alcohol minimum purchase age by state|drinking age varied from state to state]]. Some [[U. S. state|states]] do not allow those under the legal drinking age to be present in liquor stores or in [[bar (establishment)|bars]] (usually, the difference between a bar and a [[restaurant]] is that food is served only in the latter). Contrary to popular belief, since the act went into law, only a few states prohibit [[minor (law)|minors]] and [[youth|young adults]] from consuming alcohol in private settings. As of January 1, 2010, 15 states and the [[District of Columbia]] ban underage consumption outright, 17 states do not ban underage consumption, and the remaining 18 states have family member or location exceptions to their underage consumption laws.

Federal law explicitly provides for religious exceptions. As of 2005, 31 states have family member or location exceptions to their underage possession laws. However, non-alcoholic beer in many (but not all) states, such as [[Idaho]], [[Texas]], and [[Maryland]], is considered legal for those under the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/Underage_Possession_Consumption_Internal_Possession_of_Alcohol.html?tab=Maps Exceptions to Minimum Age of 21 for Possession of Alcohol as of January 1, 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721055504/http://www.alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/underage_possession_consumption_internal_possession_of_alcohol.html?tab=maps |date=2011-07-21 }}, Alcohol Policy Information System&lt;/ref&gt;

By a judge's ruling, [[South Carolina]] appears to allow the possession and consumption of alcohol by adults 18 to 20 years of age, but a circuit court judge has said otherwise.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmbfnews.com/Global/story.asp?S=10726099|title=Judge: State law barring underage drinking is unconstitutional|date=14 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The states of Washington and Wisconsin allows the consumption of alcohol in the presence of parents.

Some U.S. states have legislation that make providing to and possession of alcohol by persons under twenty-one a gross misdemeanor with a potential penalty of a $5,000 fine or up to a year in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=66.44.270 |publisher= State of Washington

It today falls in eastern [[Burkina Faso]], southwestern [[Niger]] and a small portion of southeast central [[Mali]].  A hilly region beginning on the right back of the [[Niger river]], Liptako is usually associated with the [[Liptako Emirate]], an early 19th-century [[Fula people|Fulani]] [[Islamic]] state, founded by [[Brahima Saidu]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

The other common name for the region, '''Liptako-Gourma''', is a reference to the Gourmantche people.

Modern Liptako, most of which falls in 10 to 19 provinces of Burkina Faso, along with Niger's [[Tera Department]] and [[Say Department]], and small parts of Mali, is a hilly and in parts sparsely populated area.  As elsewhere, the Fula population, known as the "Liptaako" or [[Liptako Fula]], are historically supported by semi-nomadic cattle raising and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rog3=UV&amp;rop3=103589 Fulani, Gurmanche of Burkina Faso].

The zone covered by the authority covers an area of 370,000&amp;nbsp;km², broader than the historic Liptako, including 19 provinces of Burkina Faso, 4 administrative regions of Mali, and two [[Regions of Niger|Regions]] and an urban community of Niger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9120">The following is a list of [[test card]]s used by the [[BBC]] at various points in [[broadcasting]].

==Tuning Signals==
The first "[[Interval signal|Tuning Signals]]" test card was broadcast by the BBC in 1934. It was a simple line and circle broadcast using [[John Logie Baird|Baird's]] 30 line system, and was used to synchronise the mechanical scanning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Tuning Signals |url=http://www.meldrum.co.uk/mhp/testcard/bbc_tune.html |date=29 March 2000 |publisher=Meldrum |accessdate=14 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223154155/http://www.meldrum.co.uk/mhp/testcard/bbc_tune.html |archivedate=23 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First TV TestCard.svg|150px]]

==Test Card A==
Test Card A made its debut in the late 1940s. However, it and Test Card B were soon replaced by the more useful Test Card C.&lt;ref name="meldrum"&gt;{{cite web |title=BBC Test Cards |publisher=Meldrum |date=29 March 2000 |url=http://www.meldrum.co.uk/mhp/testcard/bbc_test.html |accessdate=14 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BBCtestcardb.png|thumb]]
==Test Card B==
{{Disputed section|date=November 2017}}
Test Card B was an early BBC television test card. It was very similar to Test Card A but was never broadcast, possibly used for by BBC engineers for internal use. The original card has since gone missing. The only difference was it had an extra greyscale stripe below the circle.

The letter box in Test Card A was moved to the top of the card.&lt;ref name="meldrum" /&gt;

==Test Card C==
Test Card C was a BBC television test card first broadcast in 1948. It was the first test card to resemble the famous Test Card F.&lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt;

[[File:Testcard c.jpg|150px]]

==Test Card D==
Test Card D was a BBC television test card first broadcast in 1964. This was the first test card to be based on a specification. Later, a "Reduced Power" Test Card D was introduced.&lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt;

==Test Card E (later Test Card C)==
Test Card E was a television test card designed in 1964 and made to accommodate the 625-line system on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], as opposed to the 405-line system of Test Card D. However, depending on the source, Test Card E was either reported to have lasted for only one day or for up to a month before being withdrawn. Test Card E was thereafter replaced by a modified version of Test Card C (shown below), which lasted until 1967 when the colour Test Card F was introduced.&lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt;

[[File:Testcard E2.jpg|150px]]

==Test Card F==
{{Main|Test Card F}}
Test Card F was the BBC's longest-running and most famous test card, featuring [[Carole Hersee]] and [[Bubbles the Clown]]. There have been many different Test Card F variations. &lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt;



==Test Card G==
Test Card G was a television test card broadcast occasionally by the BBC. It was the first electronically generated test card to be broadcast, and was a variant of the [[Philips PM5544]] test pattern. &lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt; This test card was used by local transmitters for opt outs or during times when a particular region was not showing a programme broadcast from London. It was also used in place of Testcard F nationally from time to time. Test Card G was also occasionally used by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] alongside Test Card F before completely switching to the [[ETP-1]] test card in 1979.

[[File:MonoscopeCU.jpg|thumb|Pye Test Card G as seen on a [[monoscope]].]]
Another Test Card G, unrelated, was developed by [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]] as a monochrome variant on Test Card C. It was used in other countries that use 625-line [[PAL]], such as [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://internal.physics.uwa.edu.au/~agm/tvphotos/rtm.html&lt;/ref&gt;, but not in Britain.&lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt; A slightly modified version of the Pye Test Card G was used by [[YLE]] in [[Finland]] until it switched to the colour [[Telefunken]] FuBK test card in the 1970s, as well as in [[Norway]] where [[NRK]] used it in conjunction with the RETMA 1956 optical monochrome test card until it switched to the Philips PM5544, Test Card F and the Telefunken FuBK test cards in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radios-tv.co.uk/Pembers/Test-Cards/Non-UK.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test Card H==
Test Card H abandoned in development — it was never broadcast. It was used as a line up chart for cameras, possibly used to test [[chrominance|chroma]] specifications as well as [[display resolution|resolution]] and [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. The "H" designation was also used for a studio line-up card, so it was not allocated to a Test Card to avoid ambiguity.&lt;ref name="Barney-wol.net"&gt; {{cite web |title=Test Card J |publisher=Barney-wol.net |date=29 March 2000 |url=http://www.barney-wol.net/video/testcardj/testcardj.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070701213757/http://www.barney-wol.net/video/testcardj/testcardj.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=14 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BBC Test Card H.jpg|150px]]

==Test Card J==
{{Main|Test Card J}}
Test Card J is an enhanced revision of Test Card F, first broadcast in November 1999.&lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt;

==Test Card W==
{{Main|Test Card W}}
Test Card W is a widescreen update of Test Card F, first broadcast on 6 November 1998 as part of a joke on ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' to censor then-host Angus Deayton about discussing [[Peter Mandelson]]'s life. This test card was designed for the 16:9 (widescreen) ratio.&lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_xCMbz4Tmc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test Card X==
{{main|Test Card X}}
The high-definition version of Test Card W is visually similar but officially lacks a designation letter. This version is often referred to as Test Card X, but this is not a designation which the BBC recognises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Quested |first=Andy |title=A Christmas Present from the HD Channel! |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/12/a_christmas_present_from_the_h.html |date=17 December 2008 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=14 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed for use on [[high-definition television|high-definition]] TV services, and had been included a part of [[BBC HD]]'s preview loop since November 2008 (though it had been in use internally at the BBC since several years earlier) until the channel's closure in March 2013.

==Sky's HD Test Card made to look like Test Card F== 

[[BSkyB|Sky]] attempted to make a Sky HD test card that looks like Test Card F. [[Myleene Klass]] replaces [[Carole Hersee]].{{Relevence}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Revamped testcard gets a touch of Klass |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-456720/Revamped-testcard-gets-touch-Klass.html |date=22 May 2007 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=14 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unidentified test card==
An electronically generated image was first broadcast on 21 June 1997 on BBC2 between 3{{nbsp}}am and 4{{nbsp}}am. It was also broadcast in October 1997 from 3:29{{nbsp}}am until 3:44{{nbsp}}am, when, at the same time, BBC1 showed Test card G. Both channels reverted over to these at the same time, and reverted to TCF at the same time, as part of a switching test with BBC Birmingham, whereby in the event of a need to evacuate BBC TV to Birmingham, such as a power failure as happened in June 2000, a switch would be thrown, putting Birmingham (nowadays Manchester) in control of the network, until London can regain control. Both TCG and this image were transmitted from Birmingham to prove the switching facility worked.
The test card was then seen again 17 April 2007 between 4{{nbsp}}am and 5{{nbsp}}am during the [[BBC Learning Zone]]. Both transmissions were accompanied by a 4-tone test tone, ranging from extremely low frequency to a very high shrill. It is unknown if this Test Card has a name.&lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt;

==Untransmitted test cards==
There have been a number of untransmitted test cards. They would most likely be for internal use inside the BBC. Most of them are adapted from Test Card F.&lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt;

==Comic Relief test card==
A [[Comic Relief]] test card was broadcast on BBC1 on 18 March 1993 as part of Comic Relief.&lt;ref name="meldrum"/&gt; This test card featured ten-year-old competition winner Hannah Marriott, wearing a red nose.

'''Mount Athos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|θ|ɒ|s}}; {{lang-el|Άθως}}, ''Áthos'' {{IPA-el|ˈaθos|}}) is a mountain and [[peninsula]] in northeastern [[Greece]] and an important centre of [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] [[monasticism]]. It is governed as an [[Territorial autonomy|autonomous polity]] within the Greek Republic. Mount Athos is home to 20 [[monasteries]] under the direct jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]].

Mount Athos is commonly referred to in Greek as the "Holy Mountain" (''Ἅγιον Ὄρος'' ''Hágion Óros'') and the entity as the "Athonite State" (''Αθωνική Πολιτεία'', ''Athoniki Politia''). Other languages of Orthodox tradition also use names translating to "Holy Mountain" (e.g. [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] {{lang|bg|Света гора}} ''Sveta gora'', [[Russian language|Russian]] Святая гора ''Svyatya gora'', [[Georgian language|Georgian]] მთაწმინდა). In the [[Classical Greece|classical era]], while the mountain was called ''Athos'', the peninsula was known as ''Acté'' or ''Akté'' (Ἀκτή).

Mount Athos has been inhabited since ancient times and is known for its nearly 1,800-year continuous Christian presence and its long historical monastic traditions, which date back to at least 800 A.D. and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]]. Today, over 2,000 monks from Greece and many other countries, including Eastern Orthodox countries such as [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]] and [[Russia]], live an [[ascetic]] life in Athos, isolated from the rest of the world. The Athonite monasteries feature a rich collection of well-preserved artifacts, rare books, ancient documents, and [[Byzantine Art|artworks]] of immense historical value, and Mount Athos has been listed as a [[World Heritage site]] since 1988.

Although Mount Athos is technically part of the [[European Union]] like the rest of Greece, the status of the Monastic State of the Holy Mountain, and the jurisdiction of the Athonite institutions, were expressly described and ratified upon admission of Greece to the European Community (precursor to the EU). The [[Freedom of movement|free movement of people]] and [[European Single Market|goods]] in its territory is prohibited, unless formal permission is granted by the Monastic State's authorities, and only males are allowed to enter.

== Geography ==
[[File:Karta Athos.PNG|thumb|A map of Mount Athos]]

The peninsula, the easternmost "leg" of the larger [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula in central [[Greek Macedonia|Macedonia]], protrudes {{convert|50|km|mi|0}}&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;Robert Draper, [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/12/athos/draper-text "Mount Athos"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811023226/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/12/athos/draper-text |date=11 August 2011 }}, ''National Geographic'' magazine, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; into the [[Aegean Sea]] at a width of between {{convert|7|and|12|km|mi}} and covers an area of {{convert|335.6|km2|sqmi|2}}. The actual Mount Athos has steep, densely forested slopes reaching up to {{convert|2033|m|ft|0}}.

The surrounding seas, especially at the end of the peninsula, can be dangerous. In ancient Greek history two fleet disasters in the area are recorded: In 492 BC [[Darius the Great|Darius]], the king of [[Persia]], lost 300 ships under general [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''Histories'', book VI ("Erato"); [[Aeschylus]], ''The Persians''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 411 BC the [[Sparta]]ns lost a fleet of 50 ships under admiral [[Epicleas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibliotheca historica'' XIII 41, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though land-linked, Mount Athos is practically accessible only by ferry. The ''Agios Panteleimon'' and ''Axion Estin'' travel daily (weather permitting) between [[Ouranoupolis]] and [[Dafni (Athos)|Dafni]], with stops at some monasteries on the western coast. There is also a smaller speed boat, the ''Agia Anna'', which travels the same route, but with no intermediate stops. It is possible to travel by ferry to and from [[Ierissos]] for direct access to monasteries along the eastern coast.

== Access ==
The number of daily visitors to Mount Athos is restricted, and all are required to obtain a special entrance permit valid for a limited period. Only men are permitted to visit the territory, which is called the "Garden of [[Virgin Mary]]" by the monks,&lt;ref&gt;''Athonite monasticism at the dawn of the third millennium'', Pravmir Portal, September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with Orthodox Christians taking precedence in permit issuance procedures. Residents on the peninsula must be men aged 18 and over who are members of the Eastern Orthodox Church and also either monks or workers.

== History ==
[[File:Mont Athos 3D version 1.gif|thumb|A 3D model of Athos]]

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Ste01945.jpg|thumb|Imaginary view of the Alexander monument, proposed by [[Dinocrates]], engraving by [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]], 1725]]

''[[Athos (mythology)|Athos]]'' in [[Greek mythology]] is the name of one of the [[Gigantes]] that challenged the [[Greek gods]] during the [[Gigantomachy|Gigantomachia]]. Athos threw a massive rock against [[Poseidon]] which fell in the [[Aegean sea]] and became Mount Athos. According to another version of the story, Poseidon used the mountain to bury the defeated giant.

[[Homer]] mentions the mountain Athos in the [[Iliad]].&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' 14,229.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] writes that, during the Persian invasion of [[Thrace]] in 492 BC, the fleet of the Persian commander [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] was wrecked with losses of 300 ships and 20,000 men, by a strong North wind while attempting to round the coast near Mount Athos.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' 6,44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] mentions the peninsula, then called ''Acte,'' telling us that [[Pelasgians]] from the island of [[Lemnos]] populated it and naming five cities thereon, [[Sane (Acte)|Sane]], [[Cleonae (Chalcidice)|Cleonae]] (Kleonai), [[Thyssos]] (Thyssus), [[Olophyxos]] (Olophyxis), and [[Acrothoï]] (Akrothoön).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' 7,22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] also mentions the cities of Dion (Dium) and Acrothoï.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' 7,33,1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eretria]] also established colonies on Acte. At least one other city was established in the Classical period: [[Acanthus (Greece)|Acanthus]] (Akanthos). Some of these cities minted their own coins.

The peninsula was on the invasion route of [[Xerxes I]], who spent three years&lt;ref&gt;Warry, J. 1998 ''Warfare in the Classical World'' Salamander Book Ltd., London p 35&lt;/ref&gt; excavating the [[Xerxes Canal]] across the isthmus to allow the passage of his invasion fleet in 483 BC. After the death of [[Alexander the Great]], the architect [[Dinocrates]] (Deinokrates) proposed carving the entire mountain into a statue of Alexander.

The history of the peninsula during latter ages is shrouded by the lack of historical accounts. Archaeologists have not been able to determine the exact location of the cities reported by Strabo. It is believed that they must have been deserted when Athos' new inhabitants, the monks, started arriving some time before the ninth century AD.&lt;ref name="Kadas1"&gt;{{cite book

=== Early Christianity ===
[[File:Athos peninsula.jpg|thumb|The peninsula as seen from the summit of Mount Athos ({{Coord|40|9|28|N|24|19|36|E|}})]]

According to the Athonite tradition, the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] was sailing accompanied by St [[John the Evangelist]] from [[Jaffa|Joppa]] to [[Cyprus]] to visit [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]. When the ship was blown off course to then-pagan Athos, it was forced to anchor near the port of Klement, close to the present monastery of Iviron. The Virgin walked ashore and, overwhelmed by the wonderful and wild natural beauty of the mountain, she blessed it and asked her Son for it to be her garden. A voice was heard saying "{{lang|grc|Ἔστω ὁ τόπος οὖτος κλῆρος σὸς καὶ περιβόλαιον σὸν καὶ παράδεισος, ἔτι δὲ καὶ λιμὴν σωτήριος τῶν θελόντων σωθῆναι}}" (Translation: "Let this place be your inheritance and your garden, a paradise and a haven of salvation for those seeking to be saved"). From that moment the mountain was consecrated as the garden of the Mother of God and was out of bounds to all other women.&lt;ref group=note&gt;St Gregory Palamas included this tradition in his book ''Life of Petros the Athonite'', p. 150, 1005 AD.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical documents on ancient Mount Athos history are very few. It is certain that monks have been there since the fourth century, and possibly since the third. During [[Constantine I]]'s reign (324–337) both Christians and pagans were living there. During the reign of [[Julian the Apostate]] (361–363), the churches of Mount Athos were destroyed, and Christians hid in the woods and inaccessible places.&lt;ref&gt;Speake 2002, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during [[Theodosius I]]'s reign (379–395), the pagan temples were destroyed. The lexicographer [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] states that in the fifth century there was still a temple and a statue of "[[Zeus]] Athonite". After the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt]] in the seventh century, many Orthodox monks from the Egyptian desert tried to find another calm place; some of them came to the Athos peninsula. An ancient document states that monks "built huts of wood with roofs of straw [...] and by collecting fruit from the wild trees were providing themselves improvised meals."&lt;ref&gt;Biography of Saint Athanasius the Athonite&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Byzantine era: the first monasteries ===
[[File:Athos2.jpg|thumb|A Byzantine watch tower, protecting the dock (αρσανάς, ''arsanás'') of [[Xeropotamou monastery]]]]

The chroniclers [[Theophanes the Confessor]] (end of 8th century) and [[Georgios Kedrenos]] (11th century) wrote that the 726 eruption of the [[Santorini|Thera volcano]] was visible from Mount Athos, indicating that it was inhabited at the time. The historian [[Genesios]] recorded that monks from Athos participated at the [[Second Council of Nicaea|seventh Ecumenical Council of Nicaea]] of 787. Following the [[Battle of Thasos]] in 829, Athos was deserted for some time due to the destructive raids of the [[Cretan Saracens]]. Around 860, the famous monk Efthymios the Younger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to Athos and a number of monk-huts ("[[skete]] of Saint Basil") were created around his habitation, possibly near Krya Nera. During the reign of emperor [[Basil I]] the Macedonian, the former Archbishop of [[Crete]] (and later of [[Thessaloniki]]) [[Basil the Confessor]] built a small monastery at the place of the modern harbour (''arsanás'') of Hilandariou Monastery. Soon after this, a document of 883 states that a certain Ioannis Kolovos built a monastery at Megali Vigla.

On a [[chrysobull]] of emperor Basil I, dated 885, the Holy Mountain is proclaimed a place of monks, and no laymen or farmers or cattle-breeders are allowed to be settled there. The next year, in an imperial edict of emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] we read about the "so-called ancient seat of the council of [[Starets|gerondes]] (council of elders)", meaning that there was already a kind of monks' administration and that it was already "ancient". In 887, some monks expostulate to the emperor Leo the Wise that as the monastery of Kolovos is growing more and more, they are losing their peace.

In 908 the existence of a ''[[Protos (monastic office)|Protos]]'' ("First monk"), the "head" of the monastic community, is documented. In 943 the borders of the monastic state were precisely mapped; we know that Karyes was already the capital and seat of the administration, named "Megali Mesi Lavra" (Big Central Assembly). In 956, a decree offered land of about {{convert|940000|m²| acre|abbr=on}} to the Xeropotamou monastery, which means that this monastery was already quite big.

In 958, the monk [[Athanasios the Athonite]] (Άγιος Αθανάσιος ο Αθωνίτης) arrived on Mount Athos. In 962 he built the big central church of the "Protaton" in Karies. In the next year, with the support of his friend Emperor [[Nikephoros II|Nicephorus Phocas]], the monastery of [[Great Lavra (Athos)|Great Lavra]] was founded, still the largest and most prominent of the twenty monasteries existing today. It enjoyed the protection of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperors during the following centuries, and its wealth and possessions grew considerably.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book

During the 11th century, Mount Athos offered a meeting place for Serbian and Russian monk [[Scribe]]s. Russian monks first settled there in the 1070s, in ''Xylourgou Monastery'' (now [[Skiti Bogoroditsa]]); in 1089 they moved to the [[St. Panteleimon Monastery]], while the Serbs took over the Xylourgou. From 1100 to 1169 the St. Panteleimon Monastery was in a state of decay and such Russian monks as remained in Mount Athos lived at Xylourgou among the Serbs. In 1169 the Serbs received St. Panteleimon, which they shared with the Russians until 1198, when the Serbs moved to the [[Hilandar]] monastery, which became the main centre of Serbian [[monasticism]]; the Russians then remained in possession of St. Panteleimon, known since as ''[[Rossikon]]''.

The [[Fourth Crusade]] in the 13th century brought new Roman Catholic overlords, which forced the monks to complain and ask for the intervention of [[Pope Innocent III]] until the restoration of the Byzantine Empire. The peninsula was raided by [[Catalan Company|Catalan mercenaries]] in the 14th century, a century that also saw the theological conflict over the [[hesychasm]] practised on Mount Athos and defended by [[Gregory Palamas]] (Άγιος Γρηγόριος ο Παλαμάς). In late 1371 or early 1372 the Byzantines defeated an Ottoman attack on Athos.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Serbian era and influences ===

[[Serbia]]n lords of the Nemanjic Dynasty offered financial support to the monasteries of Mount Athos, while some of them also made pilgrimages and became monks there. [[Stefan Nemanja]] helped build the [[Hilandar]] monastery on Mount Athos together with his son Archbishop [[Saint Sava]] in 1198.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Thanks to the donations by Stefan, the Serbian monastery of [[Hilandar]] was enlarged to more than 10,000 hectares, thus having the largest possessions on Mount Athos among other monasteries, and occupying 1/3 of the area. Serbian nobleman Antonije Bagaš, together with Nikola Radonja, bought and restored the ruined [[Agiou Pavlou monastery]] monastery between 1355 and 1365, becoming its abbot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In return, Murad recognized the monasteries' properties, something which [[Mehmed II]] formally ratified after the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453. In this way Athonite independence was preserved.

From the account of the Russian pilgrim Isaiah, by the end of the 15th century half of the monasteries were either Slav or Albanian. In particular, [[Docheiariou monastery|Docheiariou]], [[Osiou Gregoriou monastery|Grigoriou]], [[Agiou Pavlou monastery|Ayiou Pavlou]], [[Dionysiou monastery|Ayiou Dionysiou]], and [[Hilandar|Chilandariou]] were Serbian; [[Karakalou monastery|Karakalou]] and [[Philotheou monastery|Philotheou]] were Albanian; [[Agiou Panteleimonos monastery|Panteleïmon]] was Russian; [[Simonopetra monastery|Simonopetra]] was Bulgarian; Pantokratoros and Stavronikita were Greek; and [[Zograf monastery|Zographou]], Kastamonitou, Xeropotamou, Koutloumousiou, Xenophontos, [[Iviron]] and Protaton did not bear any designation.&lt;ref name="Bakalopulos1973"&gt;{{cite book

As Serbian he instances Docheiariou, Grigoriou, Ayiou Pavlou, a monastery near Ayiou Pavlou and dedicated to St. John the Theologian (he no doubt means the monastery of Ayiou Dionysiou), and Chilandariou. Panteleïmon is Russian, Simonopetra is Bulgarian, and Karakallou and Philotheou are Albanian. Zographou, Kastamonitou (see fig. 58), Xeropotamou, Koutloumousiou, Xenophontos, Iveron and Protaton he mentions without any designation; while Lavra, Vatopedi (see fig. 59), Pantokratoros, and Stavronikita (which had been recently founded by the patriarch Jeremiah I) he names specifically as being Greek (see map 6).
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th and 16th centuries were particularly peaceful for the Athonite community. This led to relative prosperity for the monasteries. An example of this is the foundation of [[Stavronikita monastery]] which completed the current number of Athonite monasteries. Following the conquest of the [[Serbian Despotate]] by the Ottomans many Serbian monks came to Athos. The extensive presence of Serbian monks is depicted in the numerous elections of Serbian monks to the office of the [[Protos (monastic office)|Protos]] during the era.

[[File:Vatopedi 2.jpg|thumb|220px|View of the area around [[Vatopedi monastery]]]]

[[Selim I|Sultan Selim I]] was a substantial benefactor of the [[Xeropotamou monastery]]. In 1517, he issued a [[Fatwā|fatwa]] and a ''[[Hatt-i Sharif]]'' ("noble edict") that "the place, where the Holy Gospel is preached, whenever it is burned or even damaged, shall be erected again." He also endowed privileges to the Abbey and financed the construction of the dining area and underground of the Abbey as well as the renovation of the wall paintings in the central church that were completed between the years 1533–1541.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ierissos.gr/en/agiooros_abbey06.htm Municipality of Stagira, Acanthos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227053212/http://www.ierissos.gr/en/agiooros_abbey06.htm |date=27 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most time the monasteries were left on their own, the Ottomans heavily taxed them and sometimes they seized important land parcels from them.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} This eventually culminated in an economic crisis in Athos during the 17th century. This led to the adoption of the so-called "[[idiorrhythmic]]" lifestyle (a [[Hermit#Semi-eremitic variants|semi-eremitic variant]] of [[Christian monasticism]]) by a few monasteries at first and later, during the first half of the 18th century, by all.

This new way of monastic organization was an emergency measure taken by the monastic communities to counter their harsh economic environment. Contrary to the [[cenobitic]] system, monks in idiorrhythmic communities have private property, work for themselves, they are solely responsible for acquiring food and other necessities and they dine separately in their cells, only meeting with other monks at church. At the same time, the monasteries' [[abbot]]s were replaced by committees and at Karyes the Protos was replaced by a four-member committee.&lt;ref name="Skadas2"&gt;{{cite book

[[Russia]]n tsars, and princes from [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]] and [[Serbia]] (until the end of the 15th century), helped the monasteries survive with large donations. The population of monks and their wealth declined over the next centuries, but were revitalized during the 19th century, particularly by the patronage of the Russian government. As a result, the monastic population grew steadily throughout the century, reaching a high point of over 7,000 monks in 1902.

In November 1912, during the [[First Balkan War]], the Ottomans were forced out by the [[Greek Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As a result of the shortcomings of the Treaty of London, the [[Second Balkan War]] broke out between the combatants in June 1913. A final peace was agreed at the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on 10 August 1913.

In June 1913, a small Russian fleet, consisting of the gunboat ''Donets'' and the transport ships ''Tsar'' and ''Kherson'', delivered the archbishop of [[Vologda]], and a number of troops to Mount Athos to intervene in the theological controversy over ''[[imiaslavie]]'' (a Russian Orthodox movement).

The archbishop held talks with the ''imiaslavtsy'' and tried to make them change their beliefs voluntarily, but was unsuccessful. On 31 July 1913, the troops stormed the St. Panteleimon Monastery. Although the monks were not armed and did not actively resist, the troops showed very heavy-handed tactics. After the storming of St. Panteleimon Monastery, the monks from the Andreevsky Skete ([[Skiti Agiou Andrea]]) surrendered voluntarily. The military transport ''Kherson'' was converted into a prison ship and more than a thousand ''imiaslavtsy'' monks were sent to Odessa where they were excommunicated and dispersed throughout Russia.

After a brief diplomatic conflict between Greece and Russia over sovereignty, the peninsula formally came under Greek sovereignty after [[World War I]].

==== Politics ====
The self-governed region of the Holy Mountain, according to the Decree passed by the Holy Community on 3 October 1913 and according to the international treaties of [[Treaty of London, 1913|London]] (1913), [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913|Bucharest]] (1913), [[Treaty of Neuilly|Neuilly]] (1919), [[Treaty of Sèvres|Sèvres]] (1920) and [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]] (1923), is considered part of the Greek state. The Decree, "made in the presence of the [[Axion Estin#Icon and legend|Holy Icon of Axion Estin]]", stated that the Holy Community recognised the Kings of Greece as the lawful sovereigns and "successors on the Mountain" of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|"Emperors who built"]] the monasteries and declared its territory as belonging to the then Kingdom of Greece.

Political instability in Greece during the mid-20th century that affected Mount Athos included [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Nazi occupation]] from the Easter season of 1941 through late 1944, followed immediately by the [[Greek Civil War]] in a struggle where Communist efforts failed. The [[Battle of Greece]] was reported in ''Time'' magazine, "The Stukas swooped across the Aegean skies like dark, dreadful birds, but they dropped no bombs on the monks of Mount Athos".&lt;ref name="TIME Apr'41"&gt;{{cite web

After the Nazi takeover of Greece, the Epistassia, Athos's four-member executive committee, formally asked Hitler to place the Autonomous Monastic State under his personal protection, and Hitler agreed. Mount Athos survived World War II nearly untouched, and for the remainder of the war, the monks of Mount Athos referred to Adolf Hitler as "High Protector of the Holy Mountain" ({{lang-de|Hoher Protektor des heiligen Berges}}).&lt;ref name="HitlerEra"&gt;{{cite web

Later a "Special Double Assembly" of the Holy Community in Karyes passed the constitutional charter of the Holy Mountain, which was ratified by the Greek Parliament. This regime originates from the "self-ruled monastic state" as stated on a [[chrysobull]] parchment signed and sealed by the Byzantine Emperor [[John Tzimisces|Ioannis Tzimisces]] in 972.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} This important document is preserved in the House of the Holy Administration in Karyes. The self-rule of the Holy Mountain was later reaffirmed by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1095.

According to the constitution of Greece,&lt;ref name="GreekConstitution"&gt;[http://www.hri.org/MFA/syntagma/artcl120.html#A105 Article 105 of the Constitution of Greece] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311164221/http://www.hri.org/MFA/syntagma/artcl120.html#A105 |date=11 March 2007 }}&amp;nbsp;– The regime of Mount Athos.&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Athos (the "Monastic State of Agion Oros") is, "following ancient privilege", "a self-governed part of the Greek State, whose sovereignty thereon shall remain intact", and consists of 20 main monasteries which constitute the Holy Community, and the capital town and administrative centre, Karyes, also home to a governor as the representative of the Greek state. The governor is an executive appointee. The status of the Holy Mountain and the jurisdiction of the Agiorite institutions were expressly described and ratified upon admission of Greece to the [[European Union]] (then the [[European Community]]).

On 11 September 2004, the [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]], [[Patriarch Peter VII of Alexandria|Peter VII]], was killed, together with 16 others, when a Greek military Chinook helicopter in which he was travelling crashed in the [[Aegean Sea]] off the peninsula.

====Monastic life====
The monasteries of Mount Athos have a history of opposing [[ecumenism]], or movements towards reconciliation between the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]] and the Roman Catholic Church. The [[Esphigmenou]] monastery is particularly outspoken in this respect, having raised black flags to protest against the meeting of [[Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople]] and [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1972. Esphigmenou was subsequently expelled from the representative bodies of the Athonite Community. The conflict escalated in 2002 with [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] declaring the monks of Esphigmenou an illegal brotherhood and ordering their eviction; the monks refused to be evicted, and the Patriarch ordered a new brotherhood to replace them.

After reaching a low point of just 1,145 mainly elderly monks in 1971, the monasteries have been undergoing a steady and sustained renewal. By the year 2000, the monastic population had reached 1,610, with all 20 monasteries and their associated sketes receiving an infusion of mainly young well-educated monks. In 2009, the population stood at nearly 2,000.&lt;ref name="Draper" /&gt; Many younger monks possess university education and advanced skills that allow them to work on the cataloging and restoration of the Mountain's vast repository of manuscripts, vestments, icons, liturgical objects and other works of art, most of which remain unknown to the public because of their sheer volume. Projected to take several decades to complete, this restorative and archival work is well under way, funded by [[UNESCO]] and the EU, and aided by many academic institutions. The history of the modern revival of monastic life on Mount Athos and its entry into the technological world of the twenty-first century has been chronicled in Graham Speake's book, now in its second edition, ''Mount Athos. Renewal in Paradise''.&lt;ref name="Speake2014"&gt;{{cite book

== Administration and organization ==
[[File:Diamonitirion 1978.jpg|thumb|Diamonētērion from 1978]]
Athos is governed by the "Holy Community" (Ιερά Κοινότητα&amp;nbsp;– Iera Koinotita) which consists of the representatives of the 20 Holy Monasteries, having as executive committee the four-membered "Holy Administration" (Ιερά Επιστασία&amp;nbsp;– Iera Epistasia), with the [[Protos (monastic office)|Protos]] (Πρώτος) being its head.

Civil authorities are represented by the Civil Governor, appointed by the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose main duty is to supervise the function of the institutions and the public order. The current Civil Governor is [[Aristos Kasmiroglou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.orthodoxie.com/2010/05/montathos-intronisation-du-nouvel-higoum%C3%A8ne-du-monast%C3%A8re-de-chilandar.html www.orthodoxie.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628175548/http://www.orthodoxie.com/2010/05/montathos-intronisation-du-nouvel-higoum%C3%A8ne-du-monast%C3%A8re-de-chilandar.html |date=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each of the 20 monasteries&amp;nbsp;– which today all follow again the [[coenobitic]] system&amp;nbsp;– the administration is in the hands of the Abbot (Ηγούμενος&amp;nbsp;– Hēgoumenos) who is elected by the brotherhood for life. He is the lord and spiritual father of the monastery. The Convention of the brotherhood (Γεροντία) is the legislative body. All the other establishments (sketes, cells, huts, retreats, hermitages) are dependencies of some of the 20 monasteries and are assigned to the monks by a document called ''homologon'' (ομόλογον).

All persons leading a monastic life thereon acquire Greek citizenship without further formalities, upon admission as novices or monks. Visits to the peninsula are possible for laymen, but they need a special permit known as a {{transl|el|ISO|''diamonētērion''}} ({{lang|el|διαμονητήριον}}), similar to a visa.

Of the 20 monasteries located on the Holy Mountain, the brethren of 17 are predominantly ethnically Greek. Of the other 3, brethren are drawn from monks of primarily other origins, who become Greek subjects. These are the [[Hilandar|Helandariou Monastery]] (Serbian), the [[Zograf Monastery|Zografou Monastery]] (Bulgarian) and the [[Agiou Panteleimonos monastery]] (Russian).

Among the sketes, most are predominantly ethnic Greek. However, two are Romanian, the coenobitic "[[Prodromos (Mount Athos)|Skētē Timiou Prodromou]]" (which belongs to the [[Great Lavra (Athos)|Megistis Lavras Monastery]]) and the idiorrythmic "Skētē Agiou Dēmētriou tou Lakkou", also called "[[Lakkoskiti|Lakkoskētē]]" (which belongs to the [[Agiou Pavlou monastery]]). Another one is Russian, "[[Skiti Vogoroditsa|Skētē Bogoroditsa]]" (which belongs to the [[Agiou Panteleimonos monastery]]).

=== Prohibition on entry for women ===
[[File:Athos grenze frangokastro 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Sign at entrance to Mount Athos]]

There is a prohibition on entry for women, called ''avaton'' (Άβατον) in Greek, to make living in celibacy easier for men who have chosen to do so.&lt;ref name="ifpa"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMUDjICyD5U ''Mount Athos''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428113757/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMUDjICyD5U |date=28 April 2016 }}, an IFPA (Independent Film Production Associates Limited)&amp;nbsp;– Cinevideo co-production in association with Channel 4 Television, London. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Monks feel that the presence of women alters the social dynamics of the community and therefore slows their path towards spiritual enlightenment. The ban was officially proclaimed by several emperors, including [[Constantine Monomachos]], in a [[chrysobull]] of 1046.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the 14th century, Serbian Emperor [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Dušan the Mighty]] brought his wife, [[Helena of Bulgaria]], to Mount Athos to protect her from the plague, but she did not touch the ground during her entire visit, as she was carried in a [[Carriage|hand carriage]] all the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There was an incident in the 1930s regarding [[Aliki Diplarakou]], the first [[Greeks|Greek]] beauty pageant contestant to win the [[Miss Europe]] title, who made headlines when she dressed up as a man and sneaked into Mount Athos. Her escapade was discussed in a 13 July 1953 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article entitled "The Climax of Sin".&lt;ref name="Time1953"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,806694,00.html The Climax of Sin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614145555/http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,806694,00.html |date=14 June 2006 }}, ''Time Magazine'', 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Cora Miller, an American [[Fulbright Program]] teacher from [[Athens, Ohio]], landed briefly along with two other women, stirring up a controversy among the local monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 26 May 2008, five [[Moldovan people|Moldovans]] illegally entered Greece by way of Turkey, ending up on Athos; four of the migrants were women. The monks forgave them for trespassing and informed them that the area was forbidden to females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Status in the European Union ===
As part of an EU member state, Mount Athos is part of the European Union and, for the most part, subject to EU law. While outside the EU's Value Added Tax area, Mount Athos is part of the Schengen Area.&lt;ref&gt;The Greek [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:42000A0922(06) ''not'' accession treaty] does not specifically exclude Mount Athos from the Convention's territorial scope.&lt;/ref&gt; A declaration attached to Greece's accession treaty to the [[Schengen Agreement]] states that Mount Athos's "special status" should be taken into account in the application of the Schengen rules.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Declaration No. 5 attached to the Final Act of the [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:42000A0922(06) ''not'' accession treaty].&lt;/ref&gt; The monks strongly objected to Greece joining the Schengen Area based on fears that the EU would be able to end the centuries-old prohibition on the admittance of women.&lt;ref name=BBC1998&gt;{{cite news

== Culture and life in the Agion Oros ==

=== Art and literary treasures ===
[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|200px|''Jesus in Golgotha'' by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita monastery]].]]
[[File:Vatopedion.jpg|thumb|200px|A decorated wall of the Catholicon, [[Vatopedi monastery]].]]

[[File:Pantokrator 13cent.jpg|thumb|200px|An icon of Jesus, [[Hilandar]] monastery.]]

The Athonite monasteries possess huge deposits of invaluable [[Middle Ages|medieval]] art treasures, including [[icon]]s, liturgical [[vestment]]s and objects (crosses, [[Chalice (cup)|chalices]]), [[codex|codices]] and other Christian texts, imperial [[chrysobull]]s, holy [[relic]]s etc. However the monks consider them for their religious function only, not as "treasures" and most are in regular use for their original purpose. Until recently no organized study and archiving had been carried out, but an EU-funded effort to catalogue, protect and restore them is underway since the late 1980s. Their sheer number is such, it is estimated that several decades will pass before the work is completed.

Among the most ancient and priceless codices at Mount Athos are the [[Codex Athous Lavrensis]] and the [[Codex Athous Dionysiou]].

=== Languages ===
[[Greek language|Greek]] is commonly used in all the Greek monasteries, but in some monasteries there are other languages in use: in [[St. Pantaleon Monastery|Agiou Panteleimonos]], [[Russian language|Russian]] (67 monks in 2011); in [[Hilandar|Helandariou Monastery]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (58); in [[Zographou Monastery]] and [[Skiti Bogoroditsa]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (32); and in the sketes of [[Prodromos (Mount Athos)|Timiou Prodromou]] and [[Lakkoskiti]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (64). Today, many of the Greek monks also speak foreign languages. Since there are monks from many nations in Athos, they naturally also speak their own native languages.

=== Date and time reckoning ===
The [[Julian calendar]], which currently has a difference of 13 days from the [[Gregorian calendar]], is still used on Mount Athos. In 1923, as a means to eliminate the divergence existing between the religious and civil dates, after a [[synod]] in [[Constantinople]], part of the Eastern Orthodox Churches dropped 13 days and adopted the [[Revised Julian calendar]], which is synchronised with the Gregorian calendar, at least until 2800.&lt;ref group=note&gt;However, the [[Easter date]], based on the lunar cycle, is still calculated following the original Julian calendar, making the Eastern Orthodox world celebrate Easter on the same day.&lt;/ref&gt; Although under the direct jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], the spiritual head of the monastic state, nearly all the monasteries of Athos refused to follow the revised calendar and finally, for the sake of uniformity, the patriarch asked the single monastery that used the revised calendar to revert to the Julian.

Also in use is [[Byzantine time]], in which the day commences at sunset as does the liturgical day&lt;ref group=note&gt;In accordance with Old Testament practice, the day is considered to begin in the evening (Genesis 1:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and not at midnight as in the reckoning of civil time, and the difference between the two varies according to the season of the year. Because the time interval from sundown to sundown is not constant, clocks showing the Byzantine time require continual manual readjusting which in current practice is done weekly, on Saturday, if the sky is clear; where the summit of Athos is visible, 12:00 is set when the last rays of sunlight cease to shine on the tip. Some monasteries also have a clock showing civil time since boat schedules run thereon (and on the civil calendar) as well as for pilgrims who may be disoriented by Byzantine time reckoning.

=== Monastic life: monasteries, sketae, and cells ===
As described above, today the 20 monasteries of Mount Athos are the dominant holy institutions for both spiritual and administrative purposes, consolidated by the Constitutional Chart of the Holy Mountain. Although, since the beginning of Mount Athos' history, monks were living in lodgings of different size and construction quality. All these monastic lodging types exist until today, named as seats (καθίσματα), cells (κελλιά), huts (καλύβες), retreats (ησυχαστήρια), hermitages (ερημιτήρια), caves (σπήλαια), sketai (σκήτες) and all of them are known under the general term "dependencies" (εξαρτήματα) of the Holy Monasteries. The term "cells" can be used under a more generalised meaning, comprising all the above but sketae, and following this term we can talk about three different kind of institutions in Mount Athos: monasteries, sketae and cells.

==== Monasteries ====
Some information is already given above, in the section "Administration and organization". A pilgrim/visitor to a monastery, who is accommodated in the guest-house (αρχονταρίκι) can have a taste of the monastic life in it by following its daily schedule: praying (services in church or in private), common dining, working (according to the duties of each monk) and rest. During religious celebrations usually long vigils are held and the entire daily program is radically reshaped. The gate of the monastery closes by sunset and opens again by sunrise.

==== Cells ====
A cell is a house with a small church, where 1–3 monks live under the spiritual and administrative supervision of a monastery. Monastic life in the cells is totally different from that in a monastery. Some of the cells resemble tidy farmhouses, others are poor huts, others have the gentility of [[Byzantine]] tradition or of Russian architecture of the past century. Usually, each cell possesses a piece of land for agricultural or other use. Each cell has to organize some activities for income.

Besides the traditional occupations (agriculture, fishing, woodcarving, spirit distillation, iconography, tailoring, book binding etc.) new occupations have been taken up, for example taxi driving, couriers, car repairing and computer services.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The monk(s) living in a cell, having to take care of all daily chores, make up their own schedules. For the pilgrim/visitor it is worth experiencing this side of monastic life as well, but most of the cells have very limited or no capacity for hospitality.

==== Sketes ====
{{See also|Skete}}
[[File:Mount Athos- Nea Skiti.jpg|240px|right|thumb|A view of ''Nea Skiti''.]]

Small communities of neighbouring cells were developed since the beginning of monastic life on Mount Athos and some of them were using the word "skete" (σκήτη) meaning "monastic settlement" or "lavra" (λαύρα) meaning "monastic congregation". The word "skete" is of Coptic origin and in its original form is a placename of a location in the Egyptian desert.&lt;ref&gt;Variant names: Skiathis&amp;nbsp;– Sketis&amp;nbsp;– Skithis&amp;nbsp;– Skitis&amp;nbsp;– Skete&amp;nbsp;– Oros Nitrias (Nitria)&amp;nbsp;– Wadi el-Natrun&amp;nbsp;– sites including Deir el-Surian (Deir el-Syriani), the monastery of Maria Deipara, Kellia, the monastery Deir Abu Maqar, Qaret el-Dahr, Quçur el-Rubaiyat according to the on-line dictionary "Trismegistos" &lt;http://www.trismegistos.org/geo/detail.php?tm=3375 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226072534/http://www.trismegistos.org/geo/detail.php?tm=3375 |date=26 February 2012 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the Egyptian desert where monasticism made its first steps.

The unknown author of the "History of the Egyptian Monks" (Historia Monachorum in Aegypto), perhaps [[Rufinus (consul)|Flavius Rufinus]], visited the area at the end of the fourth century. He tells us: "Then we came to [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]], the best-known of all monasteries of Egypt, about forty miles [60&amp;nbsp;km] from Alexandria; it takes its name from a nearby town where Nitre is collected... In this place there are about fifty dwellings, or not many less, set near together and under one father. In some of them, there are many living together, in others a few and in some there are brothers who live alone. Though they are divided by their dwellings they remain bound together and inseparable in faith and love". This is exactly the main idea of a "skete", the communal way, just between the eremitic way and the coenobitic way of monasticism, with all 3 coexisting until today.

In 1680 the ex-patriarch [[Dionysios III Vardalis]] built in the Saint Anne skete of the Holy Mountain a big central church to accommodate all the monks of the area and in 1689 an internal regulatory text was constituted by the monks and ratified first by the Monastery of Megisti Lavra and finally by the patriarch [[Dionysios V Haritonidis]]; and later again by patriarch [[Kyrilos V]], who contributed in its evolution. Since then, more sketes followed on the same way, and gradually the term "skete" (within the Holy Mountain) came to be used only for the monastic settlements having an internal rule ratified by the Patriarchate.

Later on, some cells came to attract many monks, expanded their buildings and started functioning in the coenobitic way of the monasteries. Since the number of the Monasteries in Mount Athos was restricted to 20, a new term was introduced: the ''coenobitic skete'' (κοινόβιος σκήτη), while a skete of the traditional form was named ''idiorhythmic skete'' (ιδιόρρυθμος σκήτη) in order to underline the difference.

The first ones, both in architecture and lifestyle, follow the typical model of a monastery, that of a community living together, sharing and distributing work, and praying together daily. In contrast, the idiorrhythmic community (intermediary between the coenobitic community and the seclusion of a [[hermit]]) resembles a hamlet, and the daily life there is much like that of a cell. But there are also some duties for the community. Near the centre of the settlement is the central church called ''Kyriakon'' (Κυριακόν, that could be translated "for Sunday"), where the whole brotherhood meets for the [[Divine Liturgy]] service, on Sundays and on greater feasts. Usually there are also an administration house, a refectory for common celebrations, a cemetery, a library, storehouses and a guesthouse.

==== Twelve sketes ====
A [[skete]] is a community of Christian hermits following a monastic rule, allowing them to worship in comparative solitude, while also affording them a level of mutual practical support and security. There are two kinds of sketes in Mount Athos. A koenobitic skete follows the style of monasteries. An idiorrhythmic skete follows the style of a small village: it has a common area of worship (a church), with individual hermitages or small houses around it, each one for a small number of occupants.  There are twelve official sketes on Mount Athos.

== Friends organization ==
The Friends of Mount Athos (FoMA) is a society formed in 1990 by people who shared a common interest for the monasteries of Mount Athos, and a registered charity in the U.K. (Registered Charity No. 1047287). [[Timothy Ware]], [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] Kallistos of Diokleia, is the President of the society. Among its members are [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Heir Apparent]] to the [[British monarchy|British throne]], who is the royal patron of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although founded in the U.K., the society has an extensive international membership, including a large membership in the Americas.

The object of the society, as stated on its official web page, is described as: "the advancement of education of the public in the study and knowledge of the history, culture, arts, architecture, natural history, and literature of the Orthodox monasteries of Mount Athos and the promotion of the religious and other charitable work of the Holy Community and monasteries of Mount Athos." To that end, the society works to advance education by studying and providing information on the history, culture, arts, architecture, natural history, and literature of Mount Athos. To achieve this, it produces publications, arranges lectures, and organizes conferences and exhibitions devoted to Athonite themes.

The society also supports and promotes the religious and other charitable work of the monasteries and their dependencies as well as other religious communities with links to the Holy Mountain. FoMA acts as a group of concerned friends and supporters, providing assistance where possible, in consultation with the monastic authorities. Appeals may be launched from time to time if funds are needed for specific purposes, but the assistance mainly takes the form of expertise, liaison, or equipment needed by the monks. The society's American membership founded in 2017 a parallel charitable foundation, The Mount Athos Foundation of America.

As a service to the monasteries and to pilgrims, the society clears and maintains the ancient footpaths of Mount Athos, many of the stone-paved (Kalderimi) paths dating back to the Byzantine era. It also provides on its website detailed footpath descriptions with GPS tracks, and a regularly updated report on the condition of the paths. FoMA member and cartographer, Peter Howorth of Christchurch, New Zealand, working with the society's footpath team, has recently published a new Pilgrim Map&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athosfriends.org/PilgrimsGuide/PilgrimMap/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123190602/http://www.athosfriends.org/PilgrimsGuide/PilgrimMap/ |date=23 January 2018 }} The Friends of Mount Athos, announcement of the Pilgrim Map, with link to the cartographer's website, &lt;http://www.filathonites.org {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128021232/http://www.filathonites.org/ |date=28 January 2018 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporates modern mapping technology with study of early maps of Mount Athos.

Among the society's publications are its annual bulletin (''Friends of Mount Athos Annual Report'') offering articles, book reviews and other features related to Mount Athos. Past issues are available from the society's web site. It also publishes ''A Pilgrim's Guide to Mount Athos'' in both printed and continuously updated digital forms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athosfriends.org/PilgrimsGuide/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128021245/http://www.athosfriends.org/PilgrimsGuide/ |date=28 January 2018 }} The Friends of Mount Athos, A Pilgrim's Guide to Mount Athos, online version.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a yearly directory of members.

'''No man's land''' is land that is unoccupied or is [[Land claims|under dispute]] between parties who leave it unoccupied due to fear or uncertainty. The term was originally used to define a contested territory or a dumping ground for refuse between fiefdoms.&lt;ref name="Persico 68"/&gt; In modern times,  it is commonly associated with [[World War I]] to describe the area of land between two enemy [[Trench warfare|trench systems]], which neither side wished to cross or seize due to fear of being attacked by the enemy in the process.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;[[#Reference-Coleman|Coleman]] p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
According to Alasdair Pinkerton, an expert in human geography at the Royal Holloway University of London, the term is first mentioned in [[Domesday Book]] in the 11th century to describe parcels of land that were just beyond the London city walls.&lt;ref name="bbc.com_2015-09-30"&gt;{{Citation| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34319540| title=Adventures in No Man's Land - BBC News| newspaper=Bbc.com| date=| author=| accessdate=30 September 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930134937/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34319540| archivedate=30 September 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' contains a reference to the term dating back to 1320, and spelled ''nonesmanneslond'', when the term was used to describe a disputed territory or one over which there was legal disagreement.&lt;ref name="Persico 68"&gt;[[#Reference-Persico|Persico]] p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levenback 95"&gt;[[#Reference-Levenback|Levenback]] p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The same term was later used as the name for the piece of land outside the north wall of [[London]] that was assigned as the place of execution.&lt;ref name="Levenback 95"/&gt; The term was applied to a little-used area on ships called the [[forecastle]], a place where various ropes, tackle, block, and other supplies were stored.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson, Robert 2008"&gt;Hendrickson, Robert ''Facts on File Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom several places called No Man's Land denoted "extra-parochial spaces that were beyond the rule of the church, beyond the rule of different fiefdoms that were handed out by the king … ribbons of land between these different regimes of power".&lt;ref name="bbc.com_2015-09-30"/&gt;

== World War I ==
[[File:No-man's-land-flanders-field.jpg|thumb|centre|upright=3|A stretch of no man's land at [[Flanders Fields]], [[Belgium]], 1919]]

The [[British Army]] did not widely employ the term when the [[Regular Army]] arrived in France in August 1914, soon after the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]].&lt;ref name="WFA"&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Payne |title=No Man's Land |publisher=Western Front Association |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2009 |url=http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/great-war-on-land/battlefields/308-no-mans-land.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029164137/http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/great-war-on-land/battlefields/308-no-mans-land.html |archivedate=29 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms used most frequently at the start of the war to describe the area between the [[Trench warfare|trench lines]] included 'between the trenches' or 'between the lines'.&lt;ref name="WFA"/&gt; The term 'no man's land' was first used in a military context by soldier and historian [[Ernest Swinton]] in his short story ''The Point of View''.&lt;ref name="Persico 68"/&gt; Swinton used the term in war correspondence on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], with specific mention of the terms with respect to the [[Race to the Sea]] in late 1914.&lt;ref name="WFA"/&gt; The Anglo-German [[Christmas truce|Christmas truce of 1914]] brought the term into common use, and thereafter it appeared frequently in official communiqués, newspaper reports, and personnel correspondences of the members of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref name="WFA"/&gt;

In World War I, no man's land often ranged from several hundred yards to in some cases less than 10 yards.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{citation |first=John|last=Hamilton|title=Trench Fighting of World War I|publisher=ABDO|year=2003|page=8|isbn=1-57765-916-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily defended by machine guns, mortars, artillery and riflemen on both sides, it was often riddled with [[barbed wire]] and rudimentary improvised [[land mine]]s, as well as corpses and wounded soldiers who were not able to make it across the sea of bullets, explosions and flames. The area was usually devastated by the warfare and riddled with craters from artillery and mortar shells, and sometimes contaminated by [[chemical weapon]]s. It was open to fire from the opposing trenches and hard going generally slowed down any attempted advance. However, not only were [[soldier]]s forced to cross no man's land when advancing, and as the case might be when retreating, but after an attack the [[casualty movement|stretcher bearer]]s would need to go out into it to bring in the wounded. No man's land remained a regular feature of the battlefield until near the end of World War I, when mechanised weapons (i.e. tanks) made entrenched lines less of an obstacle.

Effects from World War I no man's lands persist today, for example at [[Verdun]] in France, where the [[Zone Rouge]] (Red Zone) is an area with [[unexploded ordnance]], poisoned beyond habitation by [[arsenic]], [[chlorine]], and [[phosgene]]. The zone is sealed off completely and still deemed too dangerous for civilians to return: "The area is still considered to be very poisoned, so the French government planted an enormous forest of black pines, like a living [[sarcophagus]]", comments Alasdair Pinkerton, a researcher at [[Royal Holloway University of London]], who compared the zone to the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|nuclear disaster site at Chernobyl]], similarly encased in a "concrete sarcophagus".&lt;ref name="bbc.com_2015-09-30"/&gt;

== Cold War ==
During the [[Cold War]], one example of "no man's land" was the territory close to the [[Iron Curtain]]. Officially the territory belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, but over the entire Iron Curtain there were several wide tracts of uninhabited land, several hundred meters in width, containing watch towers, minefields, unexploded bombs and other such debris.

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval]] Base at [[Guantánamo Bay]], Cuba is separated from [[Cuba]] proper by an area called the [[Cactus Curtain]]. In late 1961, Cuba had its troops plant an {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} barrier of ''[[Opuntia]]'' cactus along the northeastern section of the {{convert|28|km|adj=on}} fence surrounding the base to prevent economic migrants fleeing from Cuba from resettling in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/guantan.htm |title=Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Ecological Crises |work=Trade and Environment Database |publisher=[[American University]] |accessdate=2009-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327053019/http://www.american.edu/TED/guantan.htm |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was dubbed the "Cactus Curtain", an allusion to [[Europe]]'s [[Iron Curtain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940656,00.html |title=Yankees Besieged |journal=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=1962-03-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828155348/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940656,00.html |archivedate=2010-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bamboo Curtain]] in [[East Asia]]. U.S. and Cuban troops placed some 55,000 [[land mine]]s across the no man's land, creating the second-largest minefield in the world, and the largest in the [[Americas]]. On 16 May 1996, [[Bill Clinton]], the [[President of the United States]], ordered their removal. The U.S. land mines have since been replaced with [[Motion detector|motion]] and sound sensors to detect intruders. The Cuban government has not removed the corresponding minefield on its side of the border.

The [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] between Israel and Jordan were signed in [[Rhodes]] with the help of UN mediation on 3 April 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/F03D55E48F77AB698525643B00608D34 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514030830/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/F03D55E48F77AB698525643B00608D34 |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armistice lines were determined in November 1948.

{{Main|Oklahoma Panhandle}}

In 1885, the United States Interior Department ruled that what was called "The Neutral Strip" was public land and that squatter homesteads were invalid. The Strip began to be called No Man's Land around 1886 after one official stated "no man can own the land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Panhandle of Oklahoma before statehood|url=http://www.nmlhs.org/history.html|publisher=No Mans Land Historical society|accessdate=21 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020060412/http://nmlhs.org/history.html|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oltrepò Pavese''' ({{IPA-it|oltreˈpɔ ppaˈveːze}}; [[Western Lombard dialect|Western Lombard]]: '''Ultrepò Paves''') is an area of the [[Province of Pavia]], in the north-west [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Lombardy]], which lies to the south of the [[Po (river)|river Po]]. It is ''oltre'' (‘beyond’) the Po, when considered from the provincial capital [[Pavia]] and in general from the rest of [[Lombardy]].

==Geography==
[[File:Oltepo Pavese panorama.jpg|thumb|left|500px|View of the Oltrepò Pavese near [[Val di Nizza]]]]
{{Clear|left}}
Extending over an area of c. {{convert|1100|km2|abbr=on}}, it is roughly triangular in shape, with a base to the north formed by the Po and a southern apex at [[Monte Lesima]] ({{convert|1724|m|abbr=on}}), a mountain of the Ligurian Apennines which is the highest point in the province.

To the west it is bounded by the [[Province of Alessandria]] ([[Piedmont]]) and to the east by the [[Province of Piacenza]] ([[Emilia-Romagna]]). The territory comprises a plain close to the Po, a hilly section, which rises from the Valle Staffora to the west and from the upper [[Pianello Val Tidone|Val Tidone]] to the east, and a mountainous zone which in addition to Monte Lesima includes the peaks of [[Monte Chiappo]] (1700 m) Cima Colletta (1494 m) and [[Monte Penice]] (1460 m). The main watercourse is the [[Staffora]]; other streams include the Ardivestra, the [[Versa (Po)|Versa]] and the upper part of the [[Tidone]], including part of the [[Lago di Trebecco]] reservoir.

The principal settlements are [[Voghera]], [[Casteggio]], [[Broni]], [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]], [[Santa Maria della Versa]], [[Godiasco Salice Terme|Salice Terme]] and [[Varzi]].

The region became part of [[Lombardy]] in 1859.

==Tourism==
Though frequently called '''''the [[Tuscany]] of the North of Italy'''''&lt;ref&gt;CNN iReport (2011)Retrieved 13 April 2014...&lt;/ref&gt; the Oltrepò Pavese in Lombardy is fairly unknown abroad.

The area offer several attractions: smooth hills, medieval villages and castles, panoramic views, authentic Italian food and local wines. The Oltrepò happens to be the largest wine producing area of Lombardy and one of the largest in Italy, especially of the Pinot Nero.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vinoltrepo.it/languageeng/pino-nero.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape is scattered with vineyards that are freely accessible for hikers or even mountain biking.

==Gastronomy==
Particular of the area are the [[Oltrepò Pavese (wine)|local sparkling wines]], the "vivace", "frizzante" and also "spumante" wines. Reds and whites sparkle without being just sweet. The most famous local wine, the Bonarda is fruity but not sweet, in contrast to the Lambrusco e.g. A local, more classical wine is the Buttafuoco, the production of which is restricted to a small area in the North of the Oltrepò. A typical sweet red wine of the area is the ''Sangue di Giuda''. The regional champagne-like spumantes have made it to the Italian DOCG category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vinoltrepo.it/languageeng/denominazioni-dogc-e-doc.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional dishes uses the seasonal ingredients like mushrooms and [[truffle]]s, the local meats of rabbit, wild boar etc. One of typical dishes is the Sunday's "pranzo" or lunch in which all of the servings of the [[Italian meal structure|Italian menu]] (''[[Antipasto|antipasti]], [[Italian meal structure#Formal meal structure|primi]], [[Italian meal structure#Formal meal structure|secondi]], [[Italian meal structure#Formal meal structure|contorni]], [[Italian meal structure#Formal meal structure|dolci]]'') pass by, sometimes even twice. The ''Varzi salame'' is a protected product, like the Parmesan cheese.

The '''Persian embassy to Europe (1599–1602)''' was dispatched by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Shah]] [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] in 1599 to obtain an alliance against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name = "Khair 173"&gt;{{citation | title = Other routes | last = Khair | page = 173 | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-253-21821-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LASiz73_xY0C&amp;pg=PA173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Persians had then been at war with the Ottoman Empire for more than a century, and so decided to try to obtain European help against the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Don Juan of Persia | last = Le Strange | page = 2 | date = 2004-12-22 | isbn = 978-0-415-34488-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wNxmWxyKX7IC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the territorial antagonism of the Ottoman and Persian realms, there was also strong religious antagonism, as the Persians proclaimed [[Shiism]] against the Ottoman Empire's [[Sunnism]].&lt;ref name = "Khair 173" /&gt; The objective of the mission was to establish a European–Persian alliance against the Ottoman Turks.&lt;ref name = "Maquerlot 17"&gt;{{citation | title = Travel and drama in Shakespeare's time | last = Maquerlot | page = 17 | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-521-47500-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nOPIuahJU8QC&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Persian efforts at rapprochement with Europe followed the Persian defeat against the Ottoman Empire in the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590)]].

==Plan==
[[File:Anthony Sherley.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anthony Sherley]] convinced the Persian ruler [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] to send an embassy to Europe, and accompanied it in its journey.]]

The embassy was composed of one ambassador, [[Hossein Ali Beg Bayat|Hossein Ali Beg]], and four secretaries (First Secretary [[Don Juan of Persia|Uruch Beg]], son of Sultan [[Sultan Ali Beg|Ali Beg]]; the nephew of the ambassador 'Ali Quli Beg; and two others) and led by the English adventurer Sir [[Anthony Sherley]].&lt;ref name = "Strange 1"&gt;{{citation | title = Don Juan of Persia | last = Le Strange | page = 1 | date = 2004-12-22 | isbn = 978-0-415-34488-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wNxmWxyKX7IC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Strange 3"&gt;{{citation |title = Don Juan of Persia| last = Le Strange | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherley had sailed in from [[Venice]] in May 1599 with 25 other Englishmen, and had found favour with King Abbas I.&lt;ref name = "Strange 1" /&gt;  Various contacts had already taken place between the Persians and Europe, as with the embassy of [[Anthony Jenkinson]] from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1562.&lt;ref name = "Strange 3" /&gt;

The plan was to visit eight European courts, with one additional Special Envoy who would stay as the Persian ambassador at the court of Russian Emperor [[Boris Godunov]].&lt;ref name = "Strange 3" /&gt; The embassy effectively met with three German potentates, and the Italian and Spanish courts, but initial plans to meet with the courts of France, England, Scotland and Poland were abandoned on the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1 = Brothers, Harper | title = Don Juan | year = 2007 | page = 7 | isbn = 978-1-4067-6357-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nyfSt11hVdMC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Itinerary==
The embassy left in July 1599 for [[Astrakhan]].&lt;ref name = "Strange 3" /&gt; They reached [[Moscow]] in November 1599.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Don Juan of Persia| last = Le Strange | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a long voyage, they reached [[Prague]] in [[Bohemia]] in the autumn of 1600, where they met with emperor [[Rudolf II]] and were sumptuously received over the winter.  In Spring 1601 they set for [[Munich]], where they met with William II, the former [[Duke of Bavaria]].  They then went to Italy, where they were received by [[Vincenzo Gonzaga]] in [[Mantua]].  The embassy failed to meet the [[Marino Grimani (doge)|Doge]] of Venice, as he declined an interview on the ground that he was meeting an ambassador from the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Don Juan of Persia| last = Le Strange | page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final portion of their mission took them to Spain, where they met with king [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], and obtained seaborne transportation from Portugal to the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Don Juan of Persia| last = Le Strange | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a final incident however, one of the members of the embassy, a religious [[mullah]], was stabbed to death by a Spaniard in [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Don Juan of Persia| last = Le Strange | pages = 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After discussions to obtain redress, the embassy set sail for Persia from [[Lisbon]] in early 1602.&lt;ref name = "Strange 9"&gt;{{citation |title = Don Juan of Persia| last = Le Strange | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Sir Robert Shirley by Anthony Van Dyck 1622 Rome.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Shirley]] modernized the Persian army leading to the Persian victory in the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–1618)]], and led [[Persian embassy to Europe (1609–1615)|a second Persian embassy to Europe]].]]

The embassy was immediately followed by a new conflict between Persia and the Ottoman Empire, the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–1618)]], in which the Persians succeeded partly through the major military reforms and modernizations organized by the Englishman [[Robert Shirley]], brother of Anthony Sherley.

A second [[Persian embassy to Europe (1609–1615)]] would be set up, this time led by Robert Sherley himself, which went to [[Cracow]], [[Prague]], [[Florence]], Rome, [[Madrid]], London, and returned to Persia through the [[Great Mogul]]'s India.&lt;ref name = "Maquerlot 17" /&gt;

In 1616, a trade agreement was reached between Shah Abbas and the [[East India Company]] and in 1622 "a joint Anglo-Persian force expelled the Portuguese and Spanish traders from the [[Persian Gulf]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Iran and America | last = Badiozamani | page = 182 | date = 2005-05-29 | isbn = 978-0-9742172-0-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NK6_hIN8SOwC&amp;pg=PA182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1624, Robert Sherley led another embassy to England in order to obtain trade agreements.&lt;ref name = "Maquerlot 17" /&gt;

A [[Persian embassy to Louis XIV]] occurred in 1715.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19158">A '''phytochorion''', in [[phytogeography]], is a geographic area with a relatively uniform composition of plant species. Adjacent phytochoria do not usually have a sharp boundary, but rather a soft one, a transitional area in which many species from both regions overlap. The region of overlap is called a '''vegetation tension zone'''.

In traditional schemes, areas in phytogeography are classified hierarchically, according to the presence of [[endemic]] families, genera or species, e.g., in '''floral''' (or '''floristic''', '''phytogeographic''') '''zones''' and '''regions''',&lt;ref name=drude/&gt; or also in '''kingdoms''', '''regions''' and '''provinces''',&lt;ref&gt;Braun-Blanquet, J. (1932). ''Plant sociology; the study of plant communities''. New York and London, McGraw-Hill, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/7161#/summary].&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes including the categories '''empire''' and '''domain'''. However, some authors prefer not to rank areas, referring to them simply as "areas", "regions" (in a non hierarchical sense) or "phytochoria".&lt;ref&gt;Linder, Lovett, Mutke, et al. (2005): [https://books.google.com/books?id=1QwCQFbPsa4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A numerical re-evaluation of the sub-Saharan phytochoria]. ''Biologiske Skrifter'' 55: 229-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems used to classify vegetation can be divided in two major groups: those that use physiognomic-environmental parameters and characteristics and those that are based on floristic (i.e. shared genera and species) relationships.&lt;ref&gt;JOLY, C.A., AIDAR, M.P.M., KLINK, C.A., McGRATH, D.G., MOREIRA, A.G., MOUTINHO, P., NEPSTAD, D.C., OLIVEIRA, A.A.; POTT, A.; RODAL, M.J.N. &amp; SAMPAIO, E.V.S.B. 1999.

Ci. e Cult. 51: 331-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Phytochoria are defined by their plant taxonomic composition, while other schemes of [[regionalization]] (e.g., [[vegetation type]], [[physiognomy]], plant formations, [[biome]]s) may variably take in account, depending on the author, the apparent characteristics of a community (the dominant [[plant life-form|life-form]]), [[environmental factor|environment characteristics]], the [[fauna]] associated, [[anthropization|anthropic factors]] or [[political]]-[[Conservation movement|conservationist]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;Magno Coutinho, L. (2006) [http://www.scielo.br/pdf/abb/v20n1/02.pdf O conceito de bioma]. ''Acta bot. bras.'' 20(1): 13-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==

Several systems of classifying geographic areas where plants grow have been devised. Most systems are organized hierarchically, with the largest units subdivided into smaller geographic areas, which are made up of smaller floristic communities, and so on. Phytochoria are defined as areas possessing a large number of [[endemism|endemic]] [[taxon|taxa]]. Floristic kingdoms are characterized by a high degree of [[family (biology)|family]] endemism, floristic regions by a high degree of [[genus|generic]] endemism, and floristic provinces by a high degree of [[species]] endemism. Systems of phytochoria have both significant similarities and differences with [[zoogeographic province]]s, which follow the composition of [[mammal]] [[family (biology)|families]], and with [[biogeographical province]]s or terrestrial [[ecoregions]], which take into account both plant and animal species.

The term "phytochorion" (Werger &amp; van Gils, 1976)&lt;ref&gt;Werger, M. J. A. &amp; H. van Gils. 1976. Phytosociological classification problems in chorological border line areas. ''J. Biogeogr.'' 3: 49–54, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3038098].&lt;/ref&gt; is especially associated with the classifications according to the methodology of [[Josias Braun-Blanquet]], which is tied to the presence or absence of particular species,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngo.grida.no/soesa/nsoer/Data/vegrsa/vegglos.htm glossary] from {{cite book | title = Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland: A companion to the Vegetation Map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland |editor1-last=Low |editor1-first=A.

Werger), Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 99–132, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYR3NT7lldYC].&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxonomic databases tend to be organized in ways which approximate floristic provinces, but which are more closely aligned to political boundaries, for example according to the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]].

== Early schemes ==
In the late 19th century, [[Adolf Engler]] (1844-1930) was the first to make a world map with the limits of distribution of floras, with four major floral regions (realms).&lt;ref&gt;Engler, A. (1879-1882). ''Versuch einer Entwicklungsgeschichte der Pflanzenwelt''. 2 vols., Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox, C. B., Moore, P.D. &amp; Ladle, R. J. 2016. ''Biogeography: an ecological and evolutionary approach''. 9th edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons: Hoboken, p. 10, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RBcWCgAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien]]'', from the third edition (1903) onwards, also included a sketch of the division of the earth into floral regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engler|first1=Adolf|authorlink=Adolf Engler|title=Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien: eine Übersicht über das gesamte Pflanzensystem mit Berücksichtigung der Medicinal- und Nutzpflanzen nebst einer Übersicht über die Florenreiche und Florengebiete der Erde zum Gebrauch bei Vorlesungen und Studien über specielle und medicinisch-pharmaceutische Botanik|date=1903|publisher=Gebrüder Borntraeger Verlag|location=Berlin|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/22956#/summary|edition=3rd|pages=233|accessdate=31 January 2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Good (1947) regionalization==
[[File:Florenreiche.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Good (1947) floristic kingdoms]]
Botanist [[Ronald Good]] (1947) identified six floristic kingdoms ([[Boreal Kingdom|Boreal]] or Holarctic, [[Neotropic]]al, [[Paleotropical Kingdom|Paleotropical]], [[Cape floristic region|South African]], Australian, and [[Antarctic Floristic Kingdom|Antarctic]]), the largest natural units he determined for flowering plants. Good's six kingdoms are subdivided into smaller units, called provinces. The Paleotropical kingdom is divided into three subkingdoms, which are each subdivided into floristic provinces. Each of the other five kingdoms are subdivided directly into provinces. There are a total of 37 floristic provinces. Almost all provinces are further subdivided into floristic regions.&lt;ref&gt;Good, R. (1947). ''The Geography of Flowering Plants''.

'''Robert Cushman Murphy''' (April 29, 1887 – March 20, 1973) was an [[United States|American]] [[ornithologist]] and Lamont Curator of birds at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

Murphy was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to Thomas D. Murphy and Augusta Cushman. He was an undergraduate at [[Brown University]], where he graduated in 1911. The author of over 600 scientific articles, he also wrote such books as ''Logbook for Grace: Whaling Brig Daisy, 1912-1913''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gilmore, Richard C.|title=Review: ''Log of Grace'' by Robert Cushman Murphy|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=August 1949|volume=30|issue=3|pages=319–321|doi=10.2307/1375325|jstor=1375325}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Oceanic Birds of South America.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: ''Oceanic Birds of South America'' by Robert Cushman Murphy|journal=Geographical Review|date=July 1936|volume=26|issue=3|pages=489–495|jstor=209053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/11916#/summary ''Oceanic Birds of South America'' by Robert Cushman Murphy, illustrated from paintings by [[Francis Lee Jaques|Francis L. Jaques]], Biodiversity Heritage Library]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Murphy led the expedition that rediscovered the [[Bermuda petrel]], or cahow, a bird believed to have been extinct for 330 years.

In 1936 Murphy was awarded the [[Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=Elliot&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union Fellows|Corresponding Member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union]] in 1939.

After Murphy's retirement to [[Old Field, New York]], in 1957, he, along with other citizens of Long Island including [[Archibald Roosevelt]], unsuccessfully sued to stop the spraying of [[DDT]]. Before he died, the Three Village Central School District named the [[Robert Cushman Murphy Junior High School]] in his honor.

Most of his personal papers are archived at the [[American Philosophical Society]] in Philadelphia. Some of his personal papers are located at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]].

The term '''sense of place''' has been used in many different ways. It is a characteristic that some geographic [[Location (geography)|places]] have and some do not,&lt;ref name="Yi-Fu"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuan|first1=Yi-Fu|title=Space and place: The perspective of experience|date=1977|publisher=University of Minnesota press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; while to others it is a feeling or perception held by people (not by the place itself).&lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agnew|first1=J.A.|last2=Duncan|first2=J.S.|title=The power of place: Bringing together geographical and sociological imaginations|date=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman Publishers|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altman, ed.|first1=I.|last2=Low, ed.|first2=S.M.|title=Place attachment. Human behavior and environment: Advances in theory and research|date=1992|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often used in relation to those characteristics that make a place special or unique, as well as to those that foster a sense of authentic human attachment and belonging.&lt;ref name="Casey 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=E.S.|title=Between geography and philosophy: what does it mean to be in place world?|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=2001|volume=91|pages=683–693|doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as geographer [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], have pointed to senses of place that are not "positive," such as fear.&lt;ref&gt;Tuan, Yi-Fu (1980). ''Landscapes of Fear''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some students and educators engage in "[[place-based education]]" in order to improve their "sense(s) of place," as well as to use various aspects of place as educational tools in general.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2013.

==Geographic place==

[[Cultural geography|Cultural geographers]], [[anthropologists]], [[sociologists]] and [[urban planners]] study why certain places hold special meaning to particular people or animals.&lt;ref name="Spretnak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spretnak|first1=C.|title=The resurgence of the real: Body, nature and place in a hypermodern world|date=1997|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Places said to have a strong "sense of place" have a strong [[identity (social science)|identity]]  that is deeply felt by inhabitants and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=W.|title=Personal identity, national identity and international relations|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=J.|last2=Massey|first2=D.|last3=Cochrane|first3=A.|title=Rethinking the Region|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense of place is a social [[phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Agnew 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agnew|first1=J.|title=Making political geography|date=2002|publisher=Arnold Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Codes aimed at protecting, preserving and enhancing places felt to be of value include "[[World Heritage Site]]" designations, the British "[[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]" controls and the American "[[National Historic Landmark]]" designation.

==Placelessness==

Places that lack a "sense of place" are sometimes referred to as "placeless" or "inauthentic”;cultural geographer, Edward Relph investigates the "placelessness" of these locations&lt;ref&gt;Relph, Edward, Place and Placelessness&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist [[Marc Augé]] calls these "non-places."&lt;ref name="Augé"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Augé|first1=Marc|title=Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity|date=1995|publisher=Verson Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stepping against the kind of reductive thinking that placelessness can lead to, in his book, The Practice of Everyday Life, Jesuit philosopher [[Michel de Certeau]] argues that another way of seeing placelessness is to see it as space. For de Certeau,"space is merely composed of intersections of mobile elements" that are not in stasis (117). Place, on the other hand, is space that has been ordered in some way to serve some human need"(117). A park, for instance, is a place that has been constructed "in accord with which elements are distributed in relationships of coexistence"(117) and therefore "implies an indication of stability"(117). de Certeau's ideas became instrumental in understanding the intersections of power and social relations in the construction of place. For de Certeau, placelessness, or "space" was a site for freedom or at least it is the site for what Timotheus Vermeulen sees as "potentially anarchic movement"&lt;ref&gt;https://frieze.com/article/space-place&lt;/ref&gt;    Outside of de Certeau's ideas, Placeless landscapes are seen as those that have no special relationship to the places in which they are located—they could be anywhere; roadside strip [[shopping mall]]s, [[filling stations|gas/petrol stations]] and [[convenience store]]s, [[fast food]] chains, and chain [[department store]]s have been cited as examples of placeless landscape elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Mike|title=City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles|date=1990|publisher=Vintage Press, Penquin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679738060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some historic sites or districts that have been heavily commercialized for [[tourism]] and new housing estates are defined as having lost their sense of place.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=D.C.|title=From space to place and back again: reflections on the condition of post modernity|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gertrude Stein]]'s "there is no there there" has been used as a description of such places.&lt;ref&gt;''Anyone's Autobiography'', 1937: see [[Gertrude Stein]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Human geographers and social psychologists have studied how a sense of place develops, including the importance of comparisons between places, learning from elders and observing natural disasters and other events.  Of particular note is the importance of childhood experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Measham TG (2006) Learning about environments: The significance of primal landscapes, Environmental Management 38(3), pp. 426–434&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmental psychologists have quantified links between exposure to natural environments in childhood and environmental preferences later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Bixler, R. D., M. F. Floyd, and W. E. Hammitt. (2002). Environmental socialization: Quantitative tests of the childhood play hypothesis, Environment and Behavior 34(6) pp. 795–818&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about surrounding environments during childhood is strongly influenced by the direct experience of playing, as well as through the role of family, culture, and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derr | first1 = V | year = 2002 | title = Children's sense of place in northern New Mexico | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1–2| pages = 125–137 | doi=10.1006/jevp.2002.0252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The special bond which develops between children and their childhood environments has been called a "primal landscape" by human geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Gayton (1996) Landscapes of the Interior: Re-explorations of Nature and the Human Spirit. Gabriola Island, Canada: New Society Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; This childhood landscape forms part of an individual's identity and constitutes a key point of comparison for considering subsequent places later in life. As people move around as adults, they tend to consider new places in relation to this baseline landscape experienced during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Measham, TG (2007) Primal Landscapes: insights for education from empirical research on ways of learning about environments, International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education 16 (4) pp. 339–350&lt;/ref&gt; Sense of place is used as  a model for community-based psychosocial support programs.&lt;ref&gt;Prewitt Diaz, J.O. and Dayal, A.

'''Sintana''' &lt;!--{{IPAc-en|}} --&gt;is a large crater in the southern hemisphere of the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], located at 44.21° S, 76.4 ° E. It has a diameter of 58 km. The crater is named after the deity of the [[Kogi people]] of northern Colombia who produced fertile black earth&lt;ref name="GPN"/&gt; It was officially named by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] on July 3, 2015.&lt;ref name="GPN"/&gt;

Nearby prominent craters are [[Darzamat (crater)|Darzamat]] to the east, [[Hamori (crater)|Hamori]] to the southeast, the large [[Zadeni (crater)|Zadeni]] to the south, [[Annona (crater)|Annona]] further west and [[Oltagon (crater)|Oltagon]] nearly north.  Also north of Sintana is Niman Rupes.  Not far west of Sintana are a triple unnamed crater pair with the largest being next to Sintana and the furthest is the much smaller one closer to Annona.

The '''Southern Andean steppe''' is a [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]] occurring along the border of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] in the high elevations of the southern [[Andes]] mountain range.

==Setting==
This ecoregion is found from {{convert|3500|to|5000|m|ft}} in the north to {{convert|1800|to|3000|m|ft}} in the south. At higher elevations are found permanent snow, [[glacier]]s, and [[ice field]]s. At lower elevations, this ecoregion grades into [[Chilean matorral]] and [[Valdivian temperate forests]] to the west and [[Argentine monte]] to the east. To the north it transitions to the [[Central Andean dry puna]] and to the south the [[Patagonian steppe]].&lt;ref name = "wwf"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion
| id=nt1008
| name= Southern Andean steppe
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
This ecoregion has a cold [[desert climate]], [[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWk''. Precipitation falls mainly in winter.

==Flora==
The flora of this ecoregion is adapted to its cold, dry, and windy climate. Many of the plant [[genera]] have evolved [[endemic species]].&lt;ref name="wwf"/&gt;

The plants on the western side of this ecoregion can be divided into three zones based on their growth forms and elevation. In the lower elevations, {{convert|2000|to|2700|m|ft}}, grow large shrubs 
such as ''[[Chuquiraga oppositifolia]]'' and ''[[Nassauvia axillaris]]''. In intermediate elevations, {{convert|2700|to|3300|m|ft}}, grow small shrubs, tussock grasses, and cushions. These include ''[[Azorella madreporica]]'', ''[[Laretia acaulis]]'', and ''[[Stipa]]'' spp. In the highest elevations, extending to {{convert|3900|m|ft}}, grow small forbs, [[Rosette (botany)|rosettes]], and grasses such as ''[[Nassauvia lagascae]]'', ''[[Oxalis erythrorhiza]]'', ''[[Nassauvia pinnigera]]'' and ''[[Moschopsis leyboldii]]''.&lt;ref name="wwf"/&gt;

The plants on the eastern side do not grow in distinct zones. In the lower elevations, {{convert|1900|to|2700|m|ft}}, grow plants of the genera ''Stipa'', ''[[Adesmia (plant)|Adesmia]]'', ''[[Mulinum]]'', ''[[Nassauvia]]'', and ''[[Chuquiraga]]''. Higher, from {{convert|2700|to|3300|m|ft}}, are shrubs and cusion plants of ''[[Oxalis]]'', ''[[Junellia]]'', ''Adesmia'', ''[[Laretia]]'' and ''[[Azorella]]''.  At the highest elevations, {{convert|3300|to|4500|m|ft}}, grow ''[[Senecio]]'', ''[[Nassauvia]]'', ''[[Chaetanthera]]'', ''[[Draba]]'', ''[[Barneoudia]]'', ''[[Leucheria]]'', and ''[[Moschopsis]]''.&lt;ref name="wwf"/&gt;

==Fauna==
The fauna is similar to that of the [[Central Andean dry puna]] and the [[Patagonian steppe]]. Large [[mammal]]s found here include the puma (''[[Puma concolor]]''), the Andean fox (''[[Lycalopex culpaeus]]'') and the vicuna (''[[Vicugna vicugna]]'') and guanaco (''[[Lama guanicoe]]'').&lt;ref name="wwf"/&gt;

==Contemporary land use==
This ecoregion's high elevations and harsh climate make it unsuitable for development or farming, so it has experienced little habitat loss.&lt;ref name="wwf"/&gt;

==Remaining habitat==
Areas of remaining habitat include:
*[[Nevado Tres Cruces National Park]]
*[[Yerba Loca Nature Sanctuary]]
*[[Río Clarillo National Reserve]]
*[[El Morado Natural Monument]]
*[[Río de los Cipreses National Reserve]]
*[[Laguna del Laja National Park]]
*[[San Guillermo National Park]]
*[[El Leoncito National Park]]

Succession is governed by [[absolute primogeniture]].&lt;ref name="kongehuset"/&gt;
==Law of succession==
Dynasts lose their right to the throne if they marry without the permission of the monarch, to be given in the Council of State. Individuals born to unmarried dynasts or to former dynasts who married without royal permission, and their descendants, are excluded from the throne. Further, when approving a marriage, the monarch can impose conditions that must be met in order for any resulting offspring to have succession rights. Should there be no eligible descendant of King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine, the parliament has the right to elect a monarch and determine a new line of succession.

===Note===

The consent to Princess Benedikte's marriage to [[Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] in 1968 was given on the condition that their children (and further descendants) would take up permanent residence in Denmark upon reaching the age of mandatory schooling. Since the condition was not met, Princess Benedikte's children are not deemed to have succession rights and are not included in the official line of succession.&lt;ref name="kongehuset"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-royal-house|website=www.kongehuset.dk|publisher=Danish Royal Court|title=The Royal House - The Danish Monarchy|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=The throne is inherited in King Christian 10. and Queen Alexandrine's posterity.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208201408/http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-royal-house|archivedate=8 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear when exactly they lost their succession rights, whether their own descendants will have succession rights if raised in Denmark and whether their exclusion from the line of succession is constitutional, leading the Danish jurist [[Henrik Zahle]] to argue that the children of the Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg do have succession rights.&lt;ref name="peter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard |first=Peter |title=Conditional Consent, Dynastic Rights and the Danish Law of Succession |work=Hoelseth's Royal Corner |authorlink=Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard |publisher=Dag Trygsland Hoelseth |date=1999-02-02 |url=http://geocities.com/dagtho/dk-suc-law.html |accessdate=2008-08-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807131446/http://geocities.com/dagtho/dk-suc-law.html |archivedate=August 7, 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Before 1953, various descendants of King Christian IX had succession rights in Denmark. The new Act of Succession terminated those rights but left the individuals involved in possession of their titles. This created a class of people with royal titles but no rights to the throne. As a distinction, those entitled to inherit the throne are called "Prins til Danmark" (Prince to Denmark, although this distinction is not made in English) while those without succession rights are referred to as "Prins af Danmark" (Prince of Denmark).

From 1853 until 1953, the crown passed according to [[agnatic primogeniture]]. The monarch in 1953, [[King Frederick IX]], had three daughters but no sons. Before the 1953 act, the heir presumptive to the throne was [[Prince Knud of Denmark|Hereditary Prince Knud]], the King's younger brother. The Hereditary Prince was far less popular than the King was. Further, his mother-in-law, [[Princess Helena Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg|Princess Helena]], was accused of supporting the [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement during the [[Second World War]]. These factors, combined with a belief that the Salic Law was outdated, resulted in the movement to change the succession law so that Frederick's eldest daughter, the then [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Princess Margrethe]], could inherit the throne. Thus, the Salic law was changed to [[male-preference primogeniture]] in 1953, meaning that females could inherit, but only if they had no brothers.

Prince Knud had three children. His sons married without the monarch's permission and lost both their royal titles and succession rights. Only Knud's daughter, the unmarried [[Princess Elisabeth of Denmark|Princess Elisabeth]], retained her rights to the throne. Since her death, the line of succession has consisted only of descendants of [[Frederick IX of Denmark|King Frederick IX]].

Queen Margrethe II's youngest sister, [[Anne-Marie of Greece|Anne-Marie]], married [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II of Greece]] in 1964. In view of the fact that she was marrying a foreign ruler, although he was himself a Prince of Denmark, consent to the marriage was given on the condition that Anne-Marie renounced her and her descendants' rights to the Danish throne.&lt;ref name="peter"/&gt;

In 2008, the Danish parliament voted in favour of a new royal succession law that allows a first-born child to one day ascend the throne regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, similar to that of Sweden and Norway. The bill was voted through two successive parliaments, and submitted to [[Danish Act of Succession referendum, 2009|a referendum]], ensuring that, in future, the heir apparent to the throne of Denmark would be the monarch's first-born child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danishroyalwatchers.blogspot.com/2008/10/danish-referendum-on-succession-in-june.html |title=Danish referendum on succession June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 'yes' did not change the actual line of succession at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411366/738664 |title=Females get the nod in Denmark  |accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folketinget.dk/?/Samling/20051/lovforslag/L1/som_vedtaget.htm |title=Folketingets informationssystem |accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown Princess gave birth to twins on 8 January 2011. Upon their birth, the twins assumed the fourth and fifth place in the line of succession, according to the absolute primogeniture principle adopted, thereby not giving [[Prince Vincent of Denmark|Prince Vincent]] precedence over his older sister [[Princess Isabella of Denmark|Princess Isabella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kronprinsparret.dk/86d2774 A Prince and a Princess are born] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111041058/http://www.kronprinsparret.dk/86d2774 |date=2011-01-11 }}.

The '''Survey of Bangladesh''' (SOB) is the national [[map]]ping authority of [[Bangladesh]]. The agency functions under the [[Ministries of Bangladesh|Ministry of Defence]] and is headed by the [[Surveyor General]] of Bangladesh.

==History==
The SOB began as the "Bengal Survey" on 1 January 1767 in [[undivided India]] and conducted surveying and mapping activities until 1947. After the partition of the subcontinent on 14 August 1947, the organization started its new role as Survey of [[Pakistan]] and established a regional office at [[Dhaka]]. The regional office initially had 2 directorates, 2 field parties, 1 drawing office, 1 photogrammetric office (regional office for [[East Pakistan]]) and a geodetic department.

[[Topographic map]]s of [[Bengal]] were generated during the last quarter of the 18th century, covering the whole of Bangladesh at a scale of 1:50,000.

==Rights and responsibilities==
The SOB possesses the rights to all aerial photographs and other topographic maps of Bangladesh. They undertake [[Geodesy|geodetic]], topographical and aerial surveys from time to time and keep records of basic geodetic and levelling networks. Topomaps are prepared, updated and verified by ground surveys. The SOB's regular responsibilities include revising and upgrading the topographic basemaps drawn on 1:50,000 scale.

Aerial photographs in Bangladesh are used as per the 'Rules for Classification, Custody and Issue of Aerial Photographs' issued by the Ministry of Defence, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. It is broadly divided into two categories: 'Classified Photographs' and 'Public Photographs'. The aerial photographs containing sensitive sites are marked as 'Classified' and those which do not contain any sensitive information are termed 'Public'.

The SOB is also responsible for the following:

*International boundary mapping ([[Chittagong]] - Mizo Hill Sector and Bangladesh-[[Myanmar]] Area)
*Monitoring mean sea level
*Surveys of the [[Cantonment#Bangladesh|cantonments]]
*Project mapping; mapping service for various Ministries, departments and agencies; processing and preservation of aerial photographs
*Production of maps on various scales according to the needs of various departments

Map updating is a regular process and done once every five to seven years. At present the SOB is digitally updating the base map of Bangladesh. The SOB publishes all the maps from its own offset printing press and the products are available in its sales centre at the SOB campus located in the Tejgaon Industrial Area, Dhaka-1208.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2485">'''Upper Guinea''' is a geographical term used in several contexts:

# Upper Guinea ({{lang-fr|Haute-Guinée}}) is one of the four [[Geography of Guinea|geographic regions of the Republic of Guinea]], being east of [[Futa Jalon]], north of [[Guinée forestière|Forest Guinea]], and bordering [[Mali]]. The population of this region is mainly [[Malinke]].
# In a larger sense, it refers to a large plain covering eastern [[Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]] and extending into north western [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. Mostly forming the upper [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the [[River Niger]], it is sparsely populated and is home to the [[Haut Niger National Park]].
# Upper Guinea can also refer to the interior part of the wider [[Guinea (region)|Guinea region]], bordering the [[Sahel]].  The interior regions are largely defined by the watersheds of rivers that arise from [[Fouta Djallon]], including the [[Niger River|Niger]], [[Sénégal River|Senegal]], [[Falémé River|Faleme]] and others.  The term was widely applied during the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries to describe a coastal region and its related hinterland with which Europeans traded.
# In [[biogeography]], '''Upper Guinea''' refers the region of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest|tropical rainforest]] extending from southwestern Guinea through Sierra Leone, Liberia, southeastern Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, and southwestern Ghana. The [[Dahomey Gap]], a drier region of Ghana, Togo, and Benin where the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] extends to the [[Gulf of Guinea]], separates Upper Guinea from the tropical rainforests of [[Lower Guinea]] further east.&lt;ref&gt;"Guinean Forests of West Africa."
