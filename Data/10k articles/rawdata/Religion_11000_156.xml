:''Amaron should not be confused with [[Ammaron]], [[Ammoron]], or [[Amoron]], three other Book of Mormon figures with similar names.''

{{Portal|Book of Mormon}}
According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Amaron''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|eɪ|r|ɒ|n}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «a-mā´rän»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] record keeper, who received the [[Plates of Nephi]] from his father [[Omni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Omni]] in 279 BC. He wrote verses four through eight in the [[Book of Omni]], telling that a large portion of the Nephite civilization was destroyed, in fulfillment of prophecy. According to his brother Chemish, Amaron wrote his section in the day that he delivered the plates to Chemish. His brother [[Chemish]] succeeded him as the keeper of the Book of Mormon record.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
4 And now I, Amaron, write the things whatsoever I write, which are few, in the book of my father.
&lt;br /&gt;5 Behold, it came to pass that three hundred and twenty years had passed away, and the more wicked part of the Nephites were destroyed.
&lt;br /&gt;6 For the Lord would not suffer, after he had led them out of the land of Jerusalem and kept and preserved them from falling into the hands of their enemies, yea, he would not suffer that the words should not be verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall not prosper in the land.
&lt;br /&gt;7 Wherefore, the Lord did visit them in great judgment; nevertheless, he did spare the righteous that they should not perish, but did deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.
&lt;br /&gt;8 And it came to pass that I did deliver the plates unto my brother Chemish.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Omni|omni|1|4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Possible origin of the name ==
[[Hugh Nibley]] relates the name to a root meaning "friendly" or "beloved",&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt; and states:

:"Off-hand, Amaron means 'our beloved'... That root is very rich. Mar is a chief or a prince. The chief friend of the king is a 'mar'. It means 'friendly, friend', or anything like that."

Amaron is also similar to other Book of Mormon names such as [[Ammaron]], [[Ammoron]], [[Amoron]], [[Moron (Book of Mormon)|Moron]], [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], and [[Mormon]] himself etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14504">'''Bahá'í review''' refers to a requirement within the [[Bahá'í Faith]] that members must secure the permission of a Bahá'í committee before publishing anything on the religion. The Bahá'í community says the review is needed to protect the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith in its infancy when inaccurate statements could cause harm, especially given the current [[persecution of Bahá'ís]] in Iran and other parts of the world.  Some characterize this requirement as a form of [[censorship]], since there are penalties for non-compliance.

==History==
[[Bahá'u'lláh]] wrote that Bahá'í authors should write in a manner as to attract souls:
:"Thou hast written that one of the friends hath composed a treatise. This was mentioned in the Holy Presence, and this is what was revealed in response: Great care should be exercised that whatever is written in these days doth not cause dissension, and invite the objection of the people. Whatever the friends of the one true God say in these days is listened to by the people of the world. It hath been revealed in the Lawh-i-Hikmat: "The unbelievers have inclined their ears towards us in order to hear that which might enable them to cavil against God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting." Whatever is written should not transgress the bounds of tact and wisdom, and in the words used there should lie hid the property of milk, so that the children of the world may be nurtured therewith, and attain maturity. We have said in the past that one word hath the influence of spring and causeth hearts to become fresh and verdant, while another is like unto blight which causeth the blossoms and flowers to wither. God grant that authors among the friends will write in such a way as would be acceptable to fair-minded souls, and not lead to cavilling by the people."
::Bahá'u'lláh, ''The Compilation of Compilations'', vol II, p. 407.

The origin of the requirement for review comes from [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]].

:"So great is the importance and so supreme is the authority of these [[Spiritual Assembly|assemblies]] that once `Abdu'l-Bahá after having himself and in his own handwriting corrected the translation made into Arabic of the Ishraqat (the Effulgences) by Sheikh Faraj, a Kurdish friend from Cairo, directed him in a Tablet to submit the above-named translation to the Spiritual Assembly of Cairo, that he may seek from them before publication their approval and consent. These are His very words in that Tablet: — 'His honour, Sheikh Faraju'llah, has here rendered into Arabic with greatest care the Ishraqat and yet I have told him that he must submit his version to the Spiritual Assembly of Egypt, and I have conditioned its publication upon the approval of the above-named Assembly. This is so that things may be arranged in an orderly manner, for should it not be so any one may translate a certain Tablet and print and circulate it on his own account. Even a non-believer might undertake such work, and thus cause confusion and disorder. If it be conditioned, however, upon the approval of the Spiritual Assembly, a translation prepared, printed and circulated by a non-believer will have no recognition whatever.'

:"This is indeed a clear indication of the Master's [`Abdu'l-Bahá's] express desire that nothing whatever should be given to the public by any individual among the friends, unless fully considered and approved by the Spiritual Assembly in his locality; and if this (as is undoubtedly the case) is a matter that pertains to the general interest of the Cause in that land, then it is incumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly to submit it to the consideration and approval of the national body representing all the various local assemblies. Not only with regard to publication, but all matters without any exception whatsoever, regarding the interests of the Cause in that locality, individually or collectively, should be referred exclusively to the Spiritual Assembly in that locality, which shall decide upon it, unless it be a matter of national interest, in which case it shall be referred to the national body. With this national body also will rest the decision whether a given question is of local or national interest."
::Shoghi Effendi, ''Principles of Bahá'í Administration'', p. 23. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/BA/ba-13.html#gr8]

[[Shoghi Effendi]], with the above statement in mind, stated that due to the infancy of the Bahá'í Faith, the accuracy of information presented about it needed to be verified since an inaccurate statement could cause much harm to it.  Shoghi Effendi wrote:

:"They [referring to the members of every [[Spiritual Assembly]]] must supervise, in these days when the Cause is still in its infancy, all Bahá'í publications and translations, and provide in general for a dignified and accurate presentation of all Bahá'í literature and its distribution to the general public."
::Shoghi Effendi, ''Principles of Bahá'í Administration'', p. 40. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/BA/ba-28.html#gr9]

==Purpose==

The purpose of the review is threefold:
*To ensure the accuracy of the presentation of the teachings of the Faith
:"The function of reviewing is, essentially, to check the Author's exposition of the Bahá'í Faith and its teachings, which may include verification of any quotations from Bahá'í writings. This function should not be confused with evaluation of the literary merit of a work or of its value as a publication, which are normally the prerogative of the publisher..."
::The [[Universal House of Justice]]: from a letter to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles, March 11, 1965, reproduced in ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 101.
*To protect the Faith from misrepresentation by its own followers
:"... The purpose of review is to protect the Faith against misrepresentation by its own followers at this early stage of its existence when comparatively few people have any knowledge of it. An erroneous presentation of the Teachings by a Bahá'í who is accounted a scholar, in a scholarly journal, would by that very fact, do far more harm than an erroneous presentation made by an obscure Bahá'í author with no pretensions to scholarship."
::From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer, October 8, 1980 reproduced in ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 101.
*To ensure dignity of the form
:"It is an obligation of all Bahá'ís to present the faith in a dignified manner and therefore when writing articles about the Faith they should take into consideration the type of magazine or other publication in which the article is to appear. Should there be any question about its character they should consult with the National Spiritual Assembly. In addition, all authors should bear in mind that anything written about the Faith for publication is subject to review before submission to the publishers."
::The Universal House of Justice: from a letter written to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, September 15, 1968 reproduced in ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 101.

==Functioning==

The review committee is recommended to be small, composed of two or three believers which have an adequate education and knowledge of the Bahá'í Faith; and they need to deal with submitted works in a prompt manner.  Their purpose is to uphold the following standards for the publication:
*That is conforms with the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith
*That it is accurate, which may include verification of any quotations from the Bahá'í writings
*That the presentation is dignified

The review committee does not evaluate the literary merit of the work which is the prerogative of the publisher.

==Cessation==
Some people have suggested that since accurate information on the faith is now widely available, the policy should be discontinued. An example would be [[Juan Cole]], who writes:

:"The Bahá'í faith imposes a system of in-house censorship on all Bahá'ís [...]just as most Middle Eastern governments have practiced censorship since the rise of printing in the nineteenth century. Within the Bahá'í religion, any piece of writing by a Bahá'í author about the religion intended for publication is to be vetted by elected Bahá'í officials at the appropriate level (local, national, international). This requirement has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years. Critics charge that it has led to a paucity of intellectually acute Bahá'í literature, to a lack of independent magazines and to the withdrawal of a number of Bahá'í writers. The innovative research findings of the new generation of Bahá'í academics has in particular brought them into conflict with the conservatives in charge of the censorship apparatus. Although Bahá'í officials insist that the censorship requirement ("literature review") is "temporary," it has already lasted nearly a century, and the House of Justice has made it clear that it intends to keep it in effect for a very long time. And although it is sometimes alleged that "review" protects Bahá'í authors, in practice even work submitted for review, such as the ''Dialogue'' "Modest Proposal," can attract sanctions. Prepublication censorship has been among the primary techniques by which Bahá'í authors have been prevented from publishing on the controversies of contemporary Bahá'í history, and it is notable that the history of the community since about 1950 has not been written about in any detail. Contemporary history is off-limits as a subject because it would involve making value judgments on present office-holders. It is often alleged by Bahá'í conservatives that "literature review" does not actually impede the publication of research findings. But in 1988 the all-male House of Justice permanently suppressed an academic paper arguing that women could serve on the UHJ, insisting that only men could serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink = Juan Cole | last2= |first2= |date= June 1998 |title= The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 | url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal= The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |publisher=  |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages= |doi= |access-date= September 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís would note that [[Juan Cole]] is not a disinterested observer, as he states in his paper, as he had withdrawn from membership in the Bahá'í Faith as a result of an investigation into his email postings on a variety of controversial issues.

In regards to the process of review, the Bahá'í institutions have signalled their intention to continue the requirement into the indefinite future; they state that even though the Bahá'í Faith is no longer an obscure religion, the large majority of people do not know of its existence, and that most of its adherents are relatively new Bahá'ís. Because of these two things, and that the Bahá'í Faith can no longer be protected by obscurity, it becomes more important to follow the guidance of `Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi to present a correct view when more people will first hear about it:

:"The Faith is as yet in its infancy. Despite its emergence from obscurity, even now the vast majority of the human race remains ignorant of its existence; moreover, the vast majority of its adherents are relatively new Bahá'ís. The change implied by this new stage in its evolution is that whereas heretofore this tender plant was protected in its obscurity from the attention of external elements, it has now become exposed. This exposure invites close observation, and that observation will eventually lead to opposition in various quarters. So, far from adopting a carefree attitude, the community must be conscious of the necessity to present a correct view of itself and an accurate understanding of its purpose to a largely skeptical public. A greater effort, a greater care must now be exercised to ensure its protection against the malice of the ignorant and the unwisdom of its friends."

'''[[Separation of church and state]]''' is one of the primary theological distinctions of the Baptist tradition.

==History==
Originally, Baptists supported separation of church and state in [[England]] and America.&lt;ref&gt;Baptist Historian Dr. Alan Lefever, lecture at Truett Seminary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjconline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=55 |title=Baptist Heritage |year=2010 |work=[[Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty]] |accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some important Baptist figures in the struggle were [[John Smyth (1570-1612)|John Smyth]], [[Thomas Helwys]], [[Edward Wightman]], [[Leonard Busher]], [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] (who was a Baptist for a short period but became a "Seeker"), [[John Clarke (1609-1676)|John Clarke]], [[Isaac Backus]], and [[John Leland (Baptist)|John Leland]].

===English Baptists===
In 1612 [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] wrote, "the magistrate is not by virtue of his office to meddle with religion, or matters of conscience". That same year, [[Thomas Helwys]] wrote that the King of England could "command what of man he will, and we are to obey it," but, concerning the church—"with this Kingdom, our lord the King hath nothing to do." In 1614, [[Leonard Busher]] wrote what is believed to be the earliest Baptist treatise dealing exclusively with the subject of religious liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Busher, Leonard (1614). ''Religious Peace: or, a Plea for Liberty of Conscience''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Baptists===
The Danbury Baptist Association of [[Danbury, Connecticut]] sent a letter, dated October 7, 1801, to the newly elected President [[Thomas Jefferson]], expressing concern over the lack in their state constitution of explicit protection of religious liberty, and against a government establishment of religion.

In their letter to the President, the Danbury Baptists affirmed that "Our Sentiments are uniformly on the side of Religious Liberty":

{{quotation | The address of the Danbury Baptist Association in the State of Connecticut, assembled October 7, 1801.
To Thomas Jefferson, Esq., President of the United States of America

Sir,
Among the many millions in America and Europe who rejoice in your election to office, we embrace the first opportunity which we have enjoyed in our collective capacity, since your inauguration, to express our great satisfaction in your appointment to the Chief Magistracy in the United States. And though the mode of expression may be less courtly and pompous than what many others clothe their addresses with, we beg you, sir, to believe, that none is more sincere.

Our sentiments are uniformly on the side of religious liberty: that Religion is at all times and places a matter between God and individuals, that no man ought to suffer in name, person, or effects on account of his religious opinions, [and] that the legitimate power of civil government extends no further than to punish the man who works ill to his neighbor. But sir, our constitution of government is not specific. Our ancient charter, together with the laws made coincident therewith, were adapted as the basis of our government at the time of our revolution. And such has been our laws and usages, and such still are, [so] that Religion is considered as the first object of Legislation, and therefore what religious privileges we enjoy (as a minor part of the State) we enjoy as favors granted, and not as inalienable rights. And these favors we receive at the expense of such degrading acknowledgments, as are inconsistent with the rights of freemen. It is not to be wondered at therefore, if those who seek after power and gain, under the pretense of government and Religion, should reproach their fellow men, [or] should reproach their Chief Magistrate, as an enemy of religion, law, and good order, because he will not, dares not, assume the prerogative of Jehovah and make laws to govern the Kingdom of Christ.

Sir, we are sensible that the President of the United States is not the National Legislator and also sensible that the national government cannot destroy the laws of each State, but our hopes are strong that the sentiment of our beloved President, which have had such genial effect already, like the radiant beams of the sun, will shine and prevail through all these States—and all the world—until hierarchy and tyranny be destroyed from the earth. Sir, when we reflect on your past services, and see a glow of philanthropy and goodwill shining forth in a course of more than thirty years, we have reason to believe that America's God has raised you up to fill the Chair of State out of that goodwill which he bears to the millions which you preside over. May God strengthen you for the arduous task which providence and the voice of the people have called you—to sustain and support you and your Administration against all the predetermined opposition of those who wish to rise to wealth and importance on the poverty and subjection of the people.

And may the Lord preserve you safe from every evil and bring you at last to his Heavenly Kingdom through Jesus Christ our Glorious Mediator.

Signed in behalf of the Association,

Neh,h Dodge

As a religious minority in [[Connecticut]], the Danbury Baptists were concerned that a religious majority might "reproach their chief Magistrate... because he will not, dare not assume the prerogatives of Jehovah and make Laws to govern the Kingdom of Christ," thus establishing a [[state religion]] at the cost of the liberties of religious minorities.

====Wall of separation====
Thomas Jefferson's response, dated January 1, 1802, concurs with the Danbury Baptists' views on religious liberty, and the accompanying separation of civil government from concerns of religious doctrine and practice.

{{quotation | Messrs. Nehemiah Dodge, Ephraim Robbins, and Stephen S. Nelson
A Committee of the Danbury Baptist Association, in the State of Connecticut.

Washington, January 1, 1802

Gentlemen, &amp;ndash; The affectionate sentiment of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist Association, give me the highest satisfaction. My duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents, and in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing.

Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature would "[[Establishment Clause|make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof]]," thus building a wall of separation between Church and State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.

I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection and blessing of the common Father and Creator of man, and tender you for yourselves and your religious association, assurances of my high respect and esteem.

}}

This doctrine, known as the "wall of separation" or "strict separationism," would later become highly influential in 20th century Supreme Court understandings of the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|relationship between church and state]]. The phrase "[[separation of church and state]]" does not appear in the United States Constitution, despite its wide use and origin from a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]]. The relevance of this reply is a subject of heated debate, with scholars such as [[Rob Boston|Robert Boston]] emphasizing its importance, and others such as [[Mark David Hall]] arguing that the letter was a historical outlier.&lt;ref&gt;Boston, Robert. ''Why The Religious Right is Wrong About Separation of Church &amp; State''. Prometheus, Buffalo, New York, 1993, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mark David. "Jeffersonian Walls and Madisonian Lines: The Supreme Court’s Use of History in Religion Clause Cases". Oregon Law Review. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Baptist views in America==
In the U.S. today, a group of Baptists believe the [[United States]] was formed as a Christian nation by the Founding Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicreligion.org/objects/uploads/fck/file/AVS%202010%20Report%20FINAL.pdf Cox, Daniel and Jones, Robert P. ''Religion and the Tea Party in the 2010 Election: An Analysis of the Third Biennial American Values Survey.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010194705/http://www.publicreligion.org/objects/uploads/fck/file/AVS%202010%20Report%20FINAL.pdf |date=October 10, 2010 }} 2010. Retrieved 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is neither a unifying nor a codified doctrinal position among American Baptists.  Interpretations of the meaning of "separation of church and state" vary among different Baptist affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDaniel|first1=Charles|title=The Decline of the Separation Principle in the Baptist Tradition of Religious Liberty|journal=Journal of Church &amp; State|date=2008|volume=50|issue=3|pages=413-430|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=fth&amp;AN=34880596&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many Baptists in the United States still believe in the wall of separation and support maintaining it. For example, fifteen Baptist organizations, representing collectively over 10 million Baptists in America, collaborate with one another to protect religious liberty and the separation of church and state through their funding of the [[Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjconline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=136 |title=Our Mission |year=2010 |work=[[Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty]] |accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freedom of conscience is a historic [[Baptist Distinctives|Baptist distinctive]], and many Baptists continue to believe the best course for obtaining and securing freedom of conscience is through the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="heritage" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/freedom.htm |title=Doing Freedom Baptist Style: Freedom of Conscience |last=Deweese |first=Charles W. |year=2001 |publisher=Baptist History and Heritage Society |accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barranco de Badajoz''' or '''Chamoco''' is a ravine on the island of [[Tenerife]] ([[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]]), in the [[province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], part of the municipality of [[Güímar]] in the southeast of the island.&lt;ref name="Consejo"&gt;[http://www.aguastenerife.org/2_planhidrologico/index.html Plan Hidrológico] Fuente: Consejo Insular de Aguas de Tenerife&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IDE"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.idecan.grafcan.es/idecan/ Infraestructura de Datos Espaciales de Canarias] Fuente: Consejería de Educación, Universidades y Sostenibilidad. Gobierno de Canarias&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Archeology ==
The most significant prehistoric remains on the island were found in this area, demonstrating the aboriginal [[guanches|guanche]] activity. In addition, several [[Guanche mummies]] have been found here, so the place is important archaeologically.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elpensante.com/el-barranco-de-badajoz-naturaleza-encantada/ El Barranco de Badajoz.

== Legends ==
There are many legends about experiences people have had who have visited and stayed mainly at night in the Barranco de Badajoz. Many people claim to have seen apparitions of [[angel]]ic beings and to have experienced various paranormal phenomena,  ranging from [[UFO]]'s to poltergeists and orbs, balls of fire, appearances of the legendary [[Tibicena]], ritual [[satan]]ic and other spectral phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/mundo-insolito/la-historia-del-barranco-embrujado-20150712-n55642.html La historia del barranco embrujado]&lt;/ref&gt; The area has been described as similar to the [[Bridgewater Triangle]] ([[Massachusetts]]) in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/mundo-insolito/la-historia-del-barranco-embrujado-20150712-n55642.html La historia del barranco embrujado]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bespopovtsy''' ({{lang-rus|Безпоповцы|p=bʲɪspɐˈpoft͡sɨ}}, "priestless ones") are '''Priestless Old Believers''' that reject [[Nikonians (Orthodox Christianity)|Nikonian]] priests. They are one of the two major strains of [[Old Believers]]. 

Priestless Old Believers were Russia's may have evolved into the first [[Spiritual Christians]] which were divided into various and diverse tribal sects including: [[Pomortsy]], [[Fedoseyans]], [[Filippians]], ''Beguny'' ("Runners"), ''Netovtsy''/''Netovshchina'', and many others. Some reject [[priest]]s and a number of church [[rite]]s, such as the [[Eucharist]], believing that any priest or [[hierarch]] who has used the [[Nikonians (Orthodox Christianity)|Nikonian]] Rites has forfeited [[apostolic succession]]. Others still believe in the existence of a priesthood, but happen to find themselves without priests. Many such sects have historically received Nikonian priests that have publicly repented from the reforms of Patriarch Nikon.

'''Bhog''' (n. 'pleasure' or 'delight', v. 'to end' or 'to conclude') is a term used in [[Hinduism]] and [[Sikhism]]. In Sikhism, it is used for observances that are fulfilled along with the reading of the concluding part of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. It can be performed in conjunction with weddings, obsequies, anniversaries, funeral services and other occasions when a family or a worshipping community may consider such a reading appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/theology/bhog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
{{Main|Prasad}}Bhog in the [[Hindu]] religion is food given to the Gods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/26082/golden-jubilee-durga-pooja-bengalee.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduism.co.za/prasad.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719014632/http://www.hinduism.co.za/prasad.htm |archivedate=2006-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Sikhism==
The term Bhog is used in the [[Sikh]] religion for observances that are fulfilled along with the reading of the concluding part of the [[ Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji]]. The reading of this holy scripture is done on a day-to-day basis with a staff of readers at a major worship centre. The community generally relates 'Bhog' to an uninterrupted and complete reading of their holy book (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji). This usually takes days to complete through a relay of readers who work round-the-clock. This is also called the [[Akhand Path]]. This type of path and hence the 'Bhog' as it comes to its end, can be performed in conjunction with weddings, obsequies, anniversaries and other occasions, when a family or a worship community might consider such reading to be appropriate.

Bhog also takes place when a family or a community decides to go for a slower reading of the holy scripture ([[Sahaj Path]]). The reading is done as and when circumstances permit. The 'Bhog' comes at its end and has to be recited in a single session, without a break. Another variation is the [[Saptahik Path]], in which the reading of the scripture has to be completed within a week. The Sahaj Path may continue for months.

'Bhog' is a derivative from the Sanskrit word "Bhoga" and as a verb it means 'to end' or 'to conclude'. It is generally used to denote a funeral service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051228/main7.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Karah Prasad]] that is distributed at the end of any congregational service might also be termed 'Bhog'. An occasion of joy or sorrow, prompt a Sikh householder to follow the path of the [[Guru Granth Sahib|Holy Book]], preferred by himself or his family. If this is not possible, then [[Pathis]] or scripture-readers are invited for this purpose. The assignation of the time period is often announced at a local [[Gurudwara]] during the [[Sangat (term)|Sangat]]. Notices might be placed in the newspapers.

In the case of Saptahik Paths, the reader reads the entire Holy Book except for the last five pages. This is when the Karah Prasad is prepared. The unread portion is continued after the 'inaugural hymns'. The Pathi would start slowly and would read [[Guru Teg Bahadur]]'s 57 couplets, ''Mundavani'' and a ''Sloka'' (or a hymn) by [[Guru Arjan]]. The Ragamala follows this.

The ''Mundavani'' is an essential part and is like a seal to the scripture. It reiterates the essentials of the teachings of the book - ''Sat(ya)'' (the truth), ''santokh'' (contentment), ''vichar'' (wisdom) and the remembrance to the Holy name (Nam).

The [[Ardas]] is read after the reading is completed. Ardas has its own powerful associations brought into bhog. These include recalling the glorious past of the Sikhs: their heroism, devotion, martyrdom and marking the present [[Khalsa]].

After the Ardas, the Hukam or command for the day is obtained by reading out the hymn offered by the text which is naturally interpreted in the context of the intention of the path, that is, as the word of the Guru to those receiving it at that point, with their purposes particularly in mind, be it a family event, a funeral, a wedding, or invocation for blessing on a new venture.

==In West Bengal==

In [[West Bengal]] and neighboring regions, Bhog is commonly distributed in major festivals like the [[Durga Puja]], [[Kali Puja]], [[Saraswati Puja]] and other community poojas. It is commonly served in large temple complexes. The bhog is a blessed food that doubles up as a complete meal as opposed to [[prasad]], which in West Bengal, would be in smaller quantity and would not be intended to be a meal. A most common form of bhog is in the form of [[Khichdi]], served with a semi dry vegetable preparation, sweet tomato chutney and payesh ([[kheer]]), which is a rice pudding. This is typically served on flat plates of leaves of [[Sal (tree)]] joined together with small twigs, all of which are then discarded.

[[Mythology|Stories]] regarding some of these gods are collected into the body of [[Chinese mythology]]. By the 11th century ([[Song dynasty|Song period]]), these practices had been blended with [[Buddhist]] ideas of [[karma]] (one's own doing) and rebirth, and [[Taoism|Taoist]] teachings about hierarchies of gods, to form the popular religious system which has lasted in many ways until the present day.{{sfnb|Overmyer|1986|p=51}}

Chinese religions have a variety of sources, local forms, founder backgrounds, and ritual and philosophical traditions. Despite this diversity, there is a common core that can be summarised as four theological, cosmological, and moral concepts:&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5-6"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tian]]'' ({{lang|zh|天}}), Heaven, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|transcendent source]] of moral meaning; ''[[qi]]'' ({{lang|zh|氣}}), the breath or energy that animates the universe; ''[[jingzu]]'' ({{lang|zh|敬祖}}), the veneration of ancestors; and ''[[bao ying]]'' ({{lang|zh|報應}}), moral reciprocity; together with two traditional concepts of fate and meaning:&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 21"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ming yun]]'' ({{lang|zh|命運}}), the personal destiny or burgeoning; and ''[[yuan fen]]'' ({{lang|zh|緣分}}), "fateful [[coincidence]]",&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 23"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; good and bad chances and potential relationships.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 23"/&gt; 

[[Yin and yang]] ({{lang|zh|陰陽}}) is the polarity that describes the order of the universe,{{sfnb|Adler|2011|p=[http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Non-theistic.pdf 13]}} held in balance by the interaction of principles of growth (''shen'') and principles of waning (''gui''),&lt;ref name="Teiser, 1996"&gt;Teiser, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  with ''yang'' ("act") usually preferred over ''yin'' ("receptiveness") in common religion.&lt;ref name="Thien Do, 2003, pp. 10-11"/&gt; ''[[Ling (Chinese religion)|Ling]]'' ({{lang|zh|靈}}), "[[numen]]" or "[[sacred]]", is the "medium" of the two states and the inchoate order of creation.&lt;ref name="Thien Do, 2003, pp. 10-11"/&gt;

Both the present day government of China and the imperial dynasties of the Ming and Qing tolerated village popular religious cults if they bolstered social stability but suppressed or persecuted those that they feared would undermine it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madsen | first=Richard |title=The Upsurge of Religion in China |journal=Journal of Democracy |volume=21 |number=4 |date=October 2010 |url=http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/Madsen-21-4.pdf |pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the empire in 1911, governments and elites opposed or attempted to eradicate folk religion in order to promote "modern" values, and many condemned "feudal superstition". These conceptions of folk religion began to change in [[Taiwan]] in the late 20th century and in mainland [[China]] in the 21st. Many scholars now view folk religion in a positive light.{{sfnb|Gaenssbauer|2015|p=28-37}} In recent times Chinese folk religions are experiencing a revival in both mainland China and Taiwan. Some forms have received official understanding or recognition as a preservation of traditional Chinese culture, such as [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazuism]] and the [[Sanyi teaching]] in [[Fujian]],&lt;ref name="RCTC2014"&gt;Zhuo Xinping, "Relationship between Religion and State in the People’s Republic of China,''in [http://www.china-zentrum.de/fileadmin/redaktion/RCTC_2014-1_Complete_Issue.pdf Religions &amp; Christianity in Today's China]''.

Chinese "popular religion" or  "folk religion"  or "folk belief" have long been used to indicate the local and communal religious life and complexities of [[Han Chinese|Han]] local indigenous cults of China in English-language academic literature, though the Chinese language historically has not had a concept or overarching name for this. In Chinese academic literature and common usage "folk religion" (民間宗教 ''mínjiān zōngjiào'') refers to specific [[Chinese salvationist religions|organised folk religious sects]].&lt;ref&gt;Clart, 2014. p. 393. Quote: "[...] The problem started when the Taiwanese translator of my paper chose to render "popular religion" literally as ''minjian zongjiao'' 民間宗教. The immediate association this term caused in the minds of many Taiwanese and practically all mainland Chinese participants in the conference was of popular sects (''minjian jiaopai'' 民間教派), rather than the local and communal religious life that was the main focus of my paper."&lt;/ref&gt; "Folk beliefs" (民間信仰 ''mínjiān xìnyǎng'') is a technical term with little usage outside the academia,{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=397}} in which it entered into usage at first among Taiwanese scholars from [[Japanese language]] during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japan's occupation]] (1895–1945), and later between the 1990s and the early 21st century among mainland Chinese scholars.{{sfnb|Wang|2011|p=3}}

With the rise of the study of traditional cults and the creation of a government agency to give legal status to this religion,{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=399-401}} intellectuals and philosophers in China have proposed the adoption of a formal name in order to solve the terminological problems of confusion with folk religious sects and conceptualise a definite field for research and administration.{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=402}} The terms that have been proposed include "Chinese native religion" or "Chinese indigenous religion" (民俗宗教 ''mínsú zōngjiào''), "Chinese ethnic religion" (民族宗教 ''mínzú zōngjiào''),{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=402-406}} or also simply "Chinese religion" (中華教 ''Zhōnghuájiào'') viewed as comparable to the usage of the term "[[Hinduism]]" for Indian religion,{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=409}} and "Shenxianism" (神仙教 ''Shénxiānjiào'', "religion of [[shen (Chinese religion)|deities]] and [[xian (Taoism)|immortals]]"),{{sfnb|Shi|2008}} partly inspired by the term "Shenism" (神教 ''Shénjiào'') that was used in the 1950s by the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Allan J. A.

"Chinese Universism", not in the sense of "[[universalism]]", that is a system of universal application, that is [[Tian]] in Chinese thought, is a coinage of [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot]] that refers to the [[Chinese philosophy|metaphysical]] perspective that lies behind the Chinese religious tradition. De Groot calls Chinese Universism "the ancient metaphysical view that serves as the basis of all classical Chinese thought. ... In Universism, the three components of integrated universe—understood epistemologically, "heaven, earth and man", and understood ontologically, "[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] (the great beginning, the highest ultimate), yin and yang"—are formed".&lt;ref&gt;J.

Contemporary Chinese scholars have identified what they find to be the essential features of the folk (or indigenous—ethnic) religion of China. According to Chen Xiaoyi 陳曉毅 local indigenous religion is the crucial factor for a harmonious "religious ecology" (宗教生態), that is the balance of forces in a given community.{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=405}} Professor Han Bingfang 韓秉芳 has called for a [[rectification of names|rectification of distorted names]] (正名). Distorted names are "superstitious activities" (迷信活動) or "feudal superstition" (封建迷信), that were derogatorily applied to the indigenous religion by leftist policies. Christian missionaries also used the label "feudal superstition" in order to undermine their religious competitor.{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=408}} Han calls for the acknowledgment of folk religion for what it really is, the "core and soul of popular culture" (俗文化的核心與靈魂).{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=407}}

According to Chen Jinguo 陳進國, folk religion is a core element of Chinese cultural and religious self-awareness (文化自覺, 信仰自覺).{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=408}} He has proposed a theoretical definition of Chinese indigenous religion in "three inseparable attributes" (三位一體), apparently inspired to [[Tang Junyi]]'s thought:{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=408-409}}
* substance (體): religiousness (宗教性);
* function (用): folkloricity (民俗性);
* quality (相): Chineseness (中華性).

===Diversity and unity===
Chinese religious practices are diverse, varying from province to province and even from one village to another, for religious behaviour is bound to local communities, kinship, and environments. In each setting, institution and ritual behaviour assumes highly organised forms. Temples and the gods in them acquire symbolic character and perform specific functions involved in the everyday life of the local community.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Local religion preserves aspects of natural beliefs such as [[totemism]],&lt;ref name="Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61"&gt;Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; [[animism]] and [[shamanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenggang Yang, ''Social Scientific Studies of Religion in China: Methodologies, Theories, and Findings ''. BRILL, 2011. {{ISBN|9004182462}}. p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese folk religion pervades all aspects of social life. Many scholars, following the lead of sociologist [[C. K. Yang (sociologist)|C. K. Yang]], see Chinese religion deeply embedded in family and civic life, rather than expressed in a separate organisational structure like a "church," as in the West.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deity or temple associations and [[Chinese lineage associations|lineage associations]], pilgrimage associations and formalised prayers, rituals and expressions of virtues, are the common forms of organisation of Chinese religion on the local level.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5"/&gt; Neither initiation rituals nor official membership into a church organisation separate from one person's native identity are mandatory in order to be involved in religious activities.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5"/&gt; Contrary to institutional religions, Chinese religion does not require "conversion" for participation.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4"/&gt;

The prime criterion for participation in Chinese folk religion is not "to believe" in an official doctrine or [[dogma]], but "to belong" to the local unit of Chinese religion, that is the "association", the "village" or the "kinship", with their gods and rituals.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5"/&gt; Scholar Richard Madsen describes Chinese religion, adopting the definition of [[Tu Weiming]],&lt;ref&gt;Tu Weiming. ''The Global Significance of Concrete Humanity: Essays on the Confucian Discourse in Cultural China''. India Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 2010. {{ISBN|8121512204}} / 9788121512206&lt;/ref&gt; as characterised by "immanent transcendence" grounded in a devotion to "concrete humanity", focused on building moral community within concrete humanity.&lt;ref name="Madsen, 2013"&gt;Madsen, ''Secular belief, religious belonging''. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inextricably linked to the aforementioned question to find an appropriate "name" for Chinese religion, is the difficulty to define it or clearly outline its boundaries. Old [[sinology]], especially Western, tried to distinguish "popular" and "élite" traditions (the latter being Confucianism and Taoism conceived as independent systems). Chinese sinology later adopted another dichotomy which continues in contemporary studies, distinguishing "folk beliefs" (''minjian xinyang'') and "folk religion" (''minjian zongjiao''), the latter referring to the doctrinal sects.{{sfnb|Yang|Hu|2012|p=507}}

Many studies have pointed out that it is impossible to draw clear distinctions, and since the 1970s several sinologists swung to the idea of a unified "Chinese religion" that would define the Chinese national identity, similarly to Hinduism for [[India]] and Shinto for [[Japan]]. Other sinologists who have not espoused the idea of a unified "national religion" have studied Chinese religion as a system of meaning, or have brought further development in C. K. Yang's distinction between "institutional religion" and "diffused religion", the former functioning as a separate body from other social institutions, and the latter intimately part of secular social institutions.{{sfnb|Yang|Hu|2012|pp=507-508}}

===History===
====Imperial China====
By the [[Han dynasty]], Chinese religion mostly consisted of people organising into ''shè'' 社 ("group", "body", local community altars) who worshipped their godly principle. In many cases the "lord of the ''she''" was the god of the earth, and in others a deified virtuous person (''[[xian (Taoism)|xiān]]'' 仙, "immortal"). Some cults such as that of Liu Zhang, a king in what is today [[Shandong]], date back to this period.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=36-37}}

From the 3rd century on by the [[Northern Wei]], accompanying the spread of [[Buddhism]] in China, strong influences from the Indian subcontinent penetrated the Chinese indigenous religion. A cult of [[Ganesha]] (象頭神 ''Xiàngtóushén'', "Elephant-Head God") is attested in the year 531.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Martin-Dubost |first=Paul |authorlink= |title=Gaņeśa: The Enchanter of the Three Worlds |year=1997 |publisher=Project for Indian Cultural Studies |location=Mumbai |isbn= 8190018434}}. p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Pollination from [[Indian religions]] included processions of carts with images of gods or floats borne on shoulders, with musicians and chanting.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=36-37}}

====19th–20th century====

The Chinese folk religion was subject to persecution in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many local temples were destroyed during the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in the late 1800s.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 "most temples were turned to other uses or were destroyed, with a few changed into schools".{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=43}} During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China between 1937 and 1945]] many temples were used as barracks by soldiers and destroyed in warfare.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9"/&gt;{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=45}}

In the past, popular cults were regulated by imperial government policies, promoting certain deities while suppressing other ones.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=46}} In the 20th century, with the decline of the empire, increasing urbanisation and Western influence, the issue for the new intellectual class was no longer controlling unauthorised worship of unregistered gods, but became the delegitimisation of folk religion as a superstitious obstacle to modernisation.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=50}}

In 1904 a government regulation of the late empire approved for schools to be built through the confiscation of temple property.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=50}} Various "anti-superstition" campaigns followed. The [[Guomindang]] government of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|early republic]] intensified the suppression of local religion with the 1928 "Standards for retaining or abolishing gods and shrines"; the policy abolished all cults of gods with the exception of human heroes such as Yu the Great, Guan Yu and Confucius.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=51}}

These policies were the background of those that were implemented in communist China after 1949.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=51}} The [[Cultural Revolution]] between 1966 and 1976 of the [[history of the People's Republic of China (1949–76)|Maoist period]] was the last systematic effort to destroy the folk religion.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9"/&gt;{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=51}}

After 1978 Chinese folk religion started to rapidly revive in China,&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; with millions of temples being rebuilt or built from scratch.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8"/&gt; Since the 1980s the central government moved to a policy of benign neglect or ''[[wu wei]]'' ({{lang|zh|無為}}) in regard to rural community life, and the local government's new regulatory relationship with local society is characterized by practical mutual dependence; these factors have given much space for popular religion to develop.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8"/&gt; In recent years, in some cases, local governments have taken an even positive and supportive attitude towards indigenous religion in the name of promoting cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8"/&gt;{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=52}}

Instead of signaling the demise of traditional religion, China's economic development has brought a spiritual renewal.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 28"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; As its images and practices integrate the codes of Chinese culture, Chinese folk religion provides the Chinese people a means to face the challenges of modernisation.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 28"/&gt;

Chinese religion draws from a vast heritage of sacred books, which according to the general worldview treat [[cosmology]], history and mythology, mysticism and philosophy, as aspects of the same thing. Historically, the revolutionary shift toward a preference for textual transmission and text-based knowledge over long-standing oral traditions first becomes detectable in the 1st century CE.{{sfnb|Jansen|2012|p=288}} The spoken word, however, never lost its power. Rather than writing replacing the power of the spoken word, both existed side by side. Scriptures had to be recited and heard in order to be efficacious, and the limitations of written texts were acknowledged particularly in [[Taoism]] and folk religion.{{sfnb|Jansen|2012|p=289}}

There are the [[Chinese classics|classic books]] (經 ''jīng'', "[[warp (weaving)|warp]]") such as the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] canon including the "[[Four Books and Five Classics]]" (四書五經 ''Sìshū wǔjīng'') and the "[[Classic of Filial Piety]]" (孝經 ''Xiàojīng''), then there are the ''[[Mozi (book)|Mozi]]'' ([[Mohism]]), the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', the ''[[Shizi (book)|Shizi]]'' and the ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]''. The "[[Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind]]" (天人感應 ''Tiānrén Gǎnyìng'') is a set of Confucianised doctrines compiled in the Han dynasty by [[Dong Zhongshu]], discussing politics in accordance with a personal ''[[Tian]]'' of whom mankind is viewed as the incarnation.

Taoism has a separate body of philosophical, theological and ritual literature, including the fundamental ''[[Daodejing]]'' (道德經 "Book of the Way and its Virtue"), the ''[[Daozang]]'' (Taoist Canon), the ''[[Liezi]]'' and the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', and a great number of other texts either included or not within the Taoist Canon. Vernacular literature and the [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]] have produced a great body of popular mythological and theological literature, the ''[[baojuan]]'' (寶卷 "precious scrolls").

Recent discovery of ancient books, such as the "[[Guodian Chu Slips|Guodian texts]]" in the 1990s and the ''[[Huangdi sijing]]'' (黃帝四經 "Four Books of the Yellow Emperor") in the 1970s, has given rise to new interpretations of Chinese religion and new directions in its post-Maoist renewal. Many of these books overcome the dichotomy between Confucian and Taoist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Kenneth. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jhMwvmolRn8C Guodian: The Newly Discovered Seeds of Chinese Religious and Political Philosophy]''. Oxford University Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0199707685}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guodian texts include, among others, the ''[[Taiyi Shengshui]]'' (太一生水 "The Great One Gives Birth to Water"). Another book attributed to the Yellow Emperor is the ''[[Huangdi yinfujing]]'' (黃帝陰符經 "Yellow Emperor's Book of the Hidden Symbol").

Classical books of mythology include the "[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]" (山海經 ''Shānhǎijīng''), the "[[Record of Heretofore Lost Works]]" (拾遺記 ''Shíyíjì''), "[[The Peach Blossom Spring]]" (桃花源記 ''Táohuāyuánjì''), the "[[Investiture of the Gods]]" (封神演義 ''Fēngshén yǎnyì''), and the "[[Journey to the West]]" (西遊記 ''Xīyóujì'') among others.

==Core concepts of theology and cosmology==
{{See also|Chinese theology|Chinese philosophy}}
Fan and Chen summarise four spiritual, cosmological, and moral concepts:&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5-6"/&gt; ''[[Tian]]'' ({{lang|zh|天}}), Heaven, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|source]] of moral meaning; ''[[qi]]'' ({{lang|zh|氣}}), the breath or substance of which all things are made; the practice of ''[[jingzu]]'' ({{lang|zh|敬祖}}), the veneration of ancestors; ''[[bao ying]]'' ({{lang|zh|報應}}), moral reciprocity.

{{Main|Tian|Qi}}
Confucians, Taoists, and other schools of thought share basic concepts of ''Tian''. ''Tian'' is both the physical heavens, the home of the sun, moon, and stars, and also the home of the gods and ancestors. ''Tian'' by extension is source of moral meaning, as seen in the political principal, [[Mandate of Heaven]], which holds that ''Tian'', responding to human virtue, grants the imperial family the right to rule and withdraws it when the dynasty declines in virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 2011. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This creativity or virtue (''[[de (Chinese)|de]]''), in humans is the potentiality to transcend the given conditions and act wisely and morally.&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 5"&gt;Adler, 2011. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tian'' is therefore both [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanence|immanent]].&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 5"/&gt;

''Tian'' is defined in many ways, with many names, the most widely known being ''Tàidì'' 太帝 (the "Great Deity") and ''[[Shangdi|Shàngdì]]'' 上帝 (the "Primordial Deity").{{refn|group=note|name=names of Heaven|''Tian'', besides ''Taidi'' ("Great Deity") and ''[[Shangdi]]'' ("Highest Deity"), ''[[Jade Emperor|Yudi]]'' ("Jade Deity"), simply ''Shen'' 神 ("God"), and ''Taiyi'' ("Great Oneness") as identified as the ladle of the ''[[Big Dipper|Tiānmén]]'' 天門 ("Gate of Heaven", the Big Dipper),&lt;ref&gt;John Lagerwey, Marc Kalinowski. ''Early Chinese Religion I: Shang Through Han (1250 BC-220 AD)''. Two volumes. Brill, 2008. {{ISBN|9004168354}}. p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; is defined by many other names attested in the Chinese literary, philosophical and religious tradition:&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Gong. 2014. pp. 63-66&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Tiānshén'' 天神, the "God of Heaven", interpreted in the ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'' (說文解字) as "the being that gives birth to all things";
* ''Shénhuáng'' 神皇, "God the King", attested in ''Taihong'' ("The Origin of Vital Breath");
* ''Tiāndì'' 天帝, the "Deity of Heaven" or "Emperor of Heaven".
* A popular Chinese term is ''Lǎotiānyé'' (老天爺), "Old Heavenly Father".

''Tian'' is both [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanence|immanent]], manifesting in the three forms of dominance, destiny and nature. In the ''Wujing yiyi'' (五經異義, "Different Meanings in the [[Five Classics]]"), [[Xu Shen]] explains that the designation of Heaven is quintuple:&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Huáng Tiān'' 皇天 —"Yellow Heaven" or "Shining Heaven", when it is venerated as the lord of creation;
* ''Hào Tiān'' 昊天—"Vast Heaven", with regard to the vastness of its vital breath (''qi'');
* ''Mín Tiān'' 昊天—"Compassionate Heaven" for it hears and corresponds with justice to the all-under-heaven;
* ''Shàng Tiān'' 上天—"Highest Heaven" or "First Heaven", for it is the primordial being supervising all-under-heaven;
* ''Cāng Tiān'' 蒼天—"Deep-Green Heaven", for it being unfathomably deep.}} The concept of ''Shangdi'' is especially rooted in the tradition of the [[Shang dynasty]], which gave prominence to the worship of [[ancestor|ancestral gods]] and [[cultural hero]]es.

''Yin'' 陰 and ''yang'' 陽, whose root meanings respectively are "shady" and "sunny", or "dark" and "light", are modes of manifestation of the ''qi'', not material things in themselves. Yin is the ''qi'' in its dense, dark, sinking, wet, condensing mode; yang denotes the light, and the bright, rising, dry, expanding modality. Described as ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' (the "Great Pole"), they represent the polarity and complementarity that enlivens the [[cosmos]].&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 13"/&gt; They can also be conceived as "disorder" and "order", "activity" or "passivity", with act (''yang'') usually preferred over receptiveness (''yin'').&lt;ref name="Thien Do, 2003, pp. 10-11"&gt;Thien Do, 2003, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept 神 "''shén''" (cognate of 申 ''shēn'', "extending, expanding"&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 16"&gt;Adler, 2011. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;) is translated as "gods" or "spirits". There are ''shén'' of nature; gods who were once people, such as the warrior [[Guan Gong]]; household gods, such as the [[Kitchen God|Stove God]]; as well as ancestral gods (''zu'' or ''zuxian'').&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 14"/&gt; In the domain of humanity the ''shen'' is the "psyche", or the power or agency within humans.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=31}} They are intimately involved in the life of this world.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=31}} As spirits of stars, mountains and streams, ''shen'' exert a direct influence on things, making phenomena appear and things grow or extend themselves.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=31}} An early Chinese dictionary, the ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'' by [[Xu Shen]], explains that they "are the spirits of Heaven" and they "draw out the ten thousand things".{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=31}} As forces of growth the gods are regarded as ''yang'', opposed to a ''yin'' class of entities called 鬼 "''[[ghosts in Chinese culture|guǐ]]''" (cognate of 歸 ''guī'', "return, contraction"),&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 16"/&gt; chaotic beings.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=32}} A disciple of [[Zhu Xi]] noted that "between Heaven and Earth there is no thing that does not consist of yin and yang, and there is no place where yin and yang are not found. Therefore there is no place where gods and spirits do not exist".{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=32}} The [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] is a symbol of ''yang'', the principle of generation.&lt;ref name="Libbrecht 2007. p. 43"/&gt;

In [[Taoism|Taoist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] thought, the supreme God and its order and the multiplicity of ''shen'' are identified as one and the same.&lt;ref name="Zongqi Cai, 2004. p. 314"&gt;Zongqi Cai, 2004. p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Yizhuan'', a commentary to the ''[[Yijing]]'', it is written that "one ''yin'' and one ''yang'' are called the Tao ... the unfathomable change of ''yin'' and ''yang'' is called ''shen''".&lt;ref name="Zongqi Cai, 2004. p. 314"/&gt; In other texts, with a tradition going back to the [[Han dynasty|Han period]], the gods and spirits are explained to be names of ''yin'' and ''yang'', forces of contraction and forces of growth.&lt;ref name="Zongqi Cai, 2004. p. 314"/&gt;

While in popular thought they have conscience and personality,&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 2011. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Confucian scholars tended to rationalise them.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 2011. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu Xi wrote that they act according to the ''li''.&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 16"/&gt; [[Zhang Zai]] wrote that they are "the inherent potential (''liang neng'') of the two ways of ''qi''".&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 2011. pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] said that they are "traces of the creative process".&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 16"&gt;Adler, 2011. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chen Chun]] wrote that ''shen'' and ''gui'' are expansions and contractions, going and coming, of ''yin'' and ''yang''—''qi''.&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 16"/&gt;

===''Hun'' and ''po'', and ''zu'' and ''xian''===

Like all things in matter, also humans have a soul that is a dialectic of [[hun and po|''hun'' and ''po'']] (魂魄), respectively the ''yang'' spirit or mind, and the ''yin'' animal soul that is the body.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 2011. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hun'' (mind) is the ''shen'' (that gives a form to the ''qi'') of humans, and it develops through the ''po'', stretching and moving intelligently in order to grasp things.&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The ''po'' is the "feminine" soul which controls the physiological and psychological activities of man,&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 69"&gt;Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''hun'', the god attached to the vital breath, is the "masculine" soul that is totally independent of corporeal substance.&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 69"/&gt; The ''hun'' is virile, independent and perpetual, and as such it never allows itself to be limited in matter.&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 69"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The ''po'' can be compared with the ''[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' or ''[[thymos]]'' of the Greek philosophy and tradition, while the ''hun'' with the ''[[pneuma]]'' or "immortal soul".&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 69"/&gt;}} Otherwise said, the ''po'' is the "earthly" (''di'') soul that goes downward, while the ''hun'' is the "heavenly" (''tian'') soul that moves upward.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=31}}

To extend life to its full potential the human ''shen'' must be cultivated, resulting in ever clearer, more luminous states of being.&lt;ref name="Teiser, 1996"/&gt; It can transform in the pure intelligent breath of deities.&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 69"/&gt; In man there's no distinction between rationality and intuition, thinking and feeling: the human being is ''xin'' ({{lang|zh|心}}), mind-heart.&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 21"/&gt; With death, while the ''po'' returns to the earth and disappears, the ''hun'' is thought to be pure awareness or ''qi'', and is the ''shen'' to whom ancestral sacrifices are dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 2011. pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''shen'' of men who are properly cultivated and honoured after their death are upheld [[ancestor]]s and [[progenitor]]s (''zuxian'' {{lang|zh|祖先}} or simply ''zu'' {{lang|zh|祖}}).&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 14"&gt;Adler, 2011. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; When ancestries aren't properly cultivated the world falls into disruption, and they become ''gui''.&lt;ref name="Adler, 2011. p. 14"/&gt; Ancestral worship is intertwined with [[totemism]], as the earliest ancestors of an ethnic lineage are often represented as animals or associated to them.&lt;ref name="Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sautman, 1997. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestors are means of connection with the ''[[Tian]]'', the primordial god which does not have form.&lt;ref name="Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61"/&gt; As ancestors have form, they shape the destiny of humans.&lt;ref name="Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61"/&gt; Ancestors who have had a significant impact in shaping the destiny of large groups of people, creators of genetic lineages or spiritual traditions, and historical leaders who have invented crafts and institutions for the wealth of the Chinese nation ([[culture hero]]es), are exalted among the highest divine manifestations or immortal beings (''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' 仙).&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 162, p. 165"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 162, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, in the Chinese tradition there is no distinction between gods (''shen'') and immortal beings (''xian''), transcendental principles and their bodily manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;Yao, 2010. pp. 158-161&lt;/ref&gt; Gods can incarnate with a human form and human beings can reach higher spiritual states by the right way of action, that is to say by emulating the order of Heaven.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 159"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are considered one of the three aspects of a trinity (三才 ''Sāncái'', "Three Powers"),&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. pp. 162-164"&gt;Yao, 2010. pp. 162-164&lt;/ref&gt; the three foundations of all being; specifically, men are the medium between Heaven that engenders order and forms and Earth which receives and nourishes them.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. pp. 162-164"/&gt; Men are endowed with the role of completing creation.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. pp. 162-164"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=Sancai|By the words of the [[Han dynasty]] scholar Dong Zhongshu: "Heaven, Earth and humankind are the foundations of all living things.

===''Bao ying'' and ''ming yun''===
[[File:安平天后宮石將軍.JPG|thumb|Altar to the Stone Generals, protective deities, at the Kantai Tianhou Temple in [[Anping District|Anping]], [[Tainan]], [[Taiwan]].]]
{{Main|Bao ying|Ming yun}}
The Chinese traditional concept of ''bao ying'' ("reciprocity", "retribution" or "judgement"), is inscribed in the cosmological view of an ordered world, in which all manifestations of being have an allotted span (''shu'') and [[destiny]],&lt;ref&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and are rewarded according to the moral-cosmic quality of their actions.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 25"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; It determines [[fate]], as written in [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] texts: "on the doer of good, heaven sends down all blessings, and on the doer of evil, he sends down all calamities" ({{lang|zh|《書經•湯誥》}}).&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 26"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The cosmic significance of ''bao ying'' is better understood by exploring other two traditional concepts of fate and meaning:&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 21"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Ming yun]]'' ({{lang|zh|命運}}), the personal destiny or given condition of a being in his world, in which ''ming'' is "life" or "right", the given status of life, and ''yun'' defines both "circumstance" and "individual choice"; ''ming'' is given and influenced by the transcendent force ''Tian'' ({{lang|zh|天}}), that is the same as the "divine right" (''tianming'') of ancient rulers as identified by [[Mencius]].&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 21"/&gt; Personal destiny (''ming yun'') is thus perceived as both fixed (as life itself) and flexible, open-ended (since the individual can choose how to behave in ''bao ying'').&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 21"/&gt;
* ''[[Yuan fen]]'' ({{lang|zh|緣分}}), "fateful [[coincidence]]",&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 23"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; describing good and bad chances and potential relationships.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 23"/&gt; Scholars K. S. Yang and D. Ho have analysed the psychological advantages of this belief: assigning causality of both negative and positive events to ''yuan fen'' reduces the conflictual potential of guilt and pride, and preserves social harmony.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 24"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ming yun'' and ''yuan fen'' are linked, because what appears on the surface to be chance (either positive or negative), is part of the deeper rhythm that shapes personal life based on how destiny is directed.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 25"/&gt; Recognising this connection has the result of making a person responsible for his or her actions:&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 26"/&gt; doing good for others spiritually improves oneself and contributes to the harmony between men and environmental gods and thus to the wealth of a human community.&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

These three themes of the Chinese tradition—moral reciprocity, personal destiny, fateful coincidence—are completed by a fourth notion:&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 27"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Wu (Chinese religion)|Wu]]'' ({{lang|zh|悟}}), "awareness" of ''bao ying''. The awareness of one's own given condition inscribed in the ordered world produces responsibility towards oneself and others; awareness of ''yuan fen'' stirs to respond to events rather than resigning.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 27"/&gt; Awareness may arrive as a gift, often unbidden, and then it evolves into a practice that the person intentionally follows.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 27"/&gt;

As part of the trinity of being (the Three Powers), humans are not totally submissive to spiritual force.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 164"/&gt; While under the sway of spiritual forces, humans can actively engage with them, striving to change their own fate to prove the worth of their earthly life.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 164"/&gt; In the Chinese traditional view of human destiny, the dichotomy between "fatalism" and "optimism" is overcome; human beings can shape their personal destiny to grasp their real worth in the transformation of the universe, seeing their place in the alliance with the gods and with Heaven to surpass the constraints of the physical body and mind.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 164"/&gt;

===''Ling'' and ''xianling''—holy and numen===

[[File:Zhen-Wu Temple in Wuci Township.JPG|thumb|A shrine dedicated to [[Xuanwu (god)|Zhenwu]] in [[Wuqi District|Wuqi]], [[Taichung]], Taiwan.]]
{{Main|Ling (Chinese religion)|Xian ling}}
In Chinese religion the concept of ''[[ling (Chinese religion)|ling]]'' ({{lang|zh|靈}}) is the equivalent of [[sacred|holy]] and [[numen]].&lt;ref&gt;Thien Do, 2003, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shen'' in the meaning of "spiritual" is a synonym.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=32}} The ''[[Yijing]]'' states that "spiritual means not measured by yin and yang".{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=32}} ''Ling'' is the state of the "medium" of the bivalency (''yin''-''yang''), and thus it is identical with the inchoate order of creation.&lt;ref name="Thien Do, 2003, pp. 10-11"/&gt; Things inspiring awe or wonder because they can't be fathomed as either ''yin'' or ''yang'', because they cross or disrupt the polarity and therefore can't be conceptualised, are regarded as numinous.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=32}} Entities possessing unusual spiritual characteristics, such as [[albino]] members of a species, beings that are part-animal part-human, or people who die in unusual ways such as suicide or on battlefields, are considered numinous.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=32}}

The notion of ''xian ling'' ({{lang|zh|顯靈}}), variously translated as "divine efficacy, virtue" or simply the "numen", is important for the relationship between men and gods.&lt;ref&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 179-183&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the manifestation, activity, of the power of a god ({{lang|zh|靈氣}} ''ling qi'', "divine energy" or "effervescence"), the evidence of the holy.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183-184"&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183-184&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''xian ling'' may be interpreted as the god revealing his [[divine presence|presence]] in a particular area and temple,&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; through events that are perceived as extraordinary, [[miracle|miraculous]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2013. p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Divine power usually manifests in the presence of a wide public.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"/&gt; The "value" of human deities (''xian'') is judged according to his or her efficacy.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 168"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived effectiveness of a deity to protect or bless also determines how much he or she should be worshipped, how big a temple should be built in his or her honour, and what position in the broader pantheon he or she would attain.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 168"/&gt;

Zavidovskaya (2012) has studied how the incentive of temple restorations since the 1980s in [[northern and southern China|northern China]] was triggered by numerous alleged instances of gods becoming "active" and "returning", reclaiming their temples and place in society.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"/&gt; She mentions the example of a Chenghuang Temple in [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Yulin]], [[Shaanxi]], that was turned into a [[granary]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]]; it was restored to its original function in the 1980s after seeds stored within were always found to have rotted. This phenomenon, which locals attributed to the god Chenghuang, was taken a sign to empty his residence of grain and allow him back in.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"/&gt; The ''ling qi'', divine energy, is believed to accumulate in certain places, temples, making them [[holy]].&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"/&gt; Temples with a longer history are considered holier than newly built ones, which still need to be filled by divine energy.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"/&gt;

Another example Zavidovskaya cites is the cult of the god Zhenwu in Congluo Yu, [[Shanxi]];&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 185"&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; the god's temples were in ruins and the cult inactive until the mid 1990s, when a man with terminal cancer, in his last hope prayed (''bai'' 拜) to Zhenwu. The man began to miraculously recover each passing day, and after a year he was completely healed.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 185"/&gt; As thanksgiving, he organised an opera performance in the god’s honour.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 185"/&gt; A temporary altar with a statue of Zhenwu and a stage for the performance were set up in an open space at the foot of a mountain.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 185"/&gt; During the course of the opera, large white snakes appeared, passive and unafraid of the people, seemingly watching the opera; the snakes were considered by locals to be incarnations of Zhenwu, come to watch the opera held in his honour.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 185"/&gt;

Within temples, it is common to see banners bearing the phrase "if the heart is sincere, the god will reveal his power" ({{lang|zh|心誠神靈}} ''xin cheng shen ling'').&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183"&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between men and gods is an exchange of favour.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183"/&gt; This implies the belief that gods respond to the entreaties of the believer if his or her religious fervour is sincere (''cheng xin'' {{lang|zh|誠心}}).&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183"/&gt; If a person believes in the god's power with all his heart and expresses piety, the gods are confident in his faith and reveal their efficacious power.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183"/&gt; At the same time, for faith to strengthen in the devotee’s heart, the deity has to prove his or her efficacy.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183"/&gt; In exchange for divine favours, a faithful honours the deity with vows (''huan yuan'' {{lang|zh|還願}} or ''xu yuan'' {{lang|zh|許願}}), through individual worship, reverence and respect (''jing shen'' {{lang|zh|敬神}}).&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183"/&gt;

The most common display of divine power is the cure of diseases after a believer piously requests aid.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"/&gt; Another manifestation is granting a request of children.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"/&gt; The deity may also manifest through mediumship, entering the body of a shaman-medium and speaking through them.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"/&gt; There have been cases of people curing illnesses "on behalf of a god" (''ti shen zhi bing'' {{lang|zh|替神治病}}).&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 185"/&gt; Gods may also speak to people when they are asleep (''tuomeng'' {{lang|zh|託夢}}).&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184"/&gt;

==Sociological typology==
Wu Hsin-Chao (2014) distinguishes four kinds of Chinese traditional religious organisation:{{sfnb|Wu|2014|p=11, and note 1}} ① [[Chinese ancestral religion|ancestry worship]]; ② [[Chinese communal deity religion|deity worship]]; ③ [[Chinese secret societies|secret societies]]; and ④ [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]].

Chinese religion in its communal expression involves the worship of gods that are the generative power and tutelary spirit (''[[genius loci]]'') of a locality or a certain aspect of nature (for example [[water gods]], [[river gods]], [[fire gods]], [[mountain gods]]), or of gods that are common ancestors of a village, a larger identity, or the Chinese nation ([[Shennong]], [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]], [[Pangu]]).

The social structure of this religion is the ''shénshè'' 神社 (literally "society of a god"), synonymous with ''shehui'' 社會, in which ''shè'' 社 originally meant the altar of a community's earth god,{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=xii}} while 會 ''huì'' means "association", "assembly", "church" or "gathering". This type of religious trusts can be dedicated to a god which is bound to a single village or temple or to a god which has a wider following, in multiple villages, provinces or even a national importance. [[Mao Zedong]] distinguished "god associations", "village communities" and "temple associations" in his analysis of religious trusts.&lt;ref name="Mao-hui"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mao | first1 = Zedong | last2 = Reynolds Schram | first2 = Stuart | last3 = Hodes | first3 = Nancy Jane | year = 1992 | title = Mao's Road to Power: From the Jinggangshan to the establishment of the Jiangxi Soviets, July 1927-December 1930 | publisher = M.

These societies organise gatherings and festivals (''[[miaohui]]'' 廟會) participated by members of the whole village or larger community on the occasions of what are believed to be the birthdays of the gods or other events,&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8"/&gt; or to seek protection from droughts, epidemics, and other disasters.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8"/&gt; Such festivals invoke the power of the gods for practical goals to "summon blessings and drive away harm".&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8"/&gt; Special devotional currents within this framework can be identified by specific names such as [[Mazuism]] (媽祖教 ''Māzǔjiào''),&lt;ref&gt;Fujian Government's website: [http://www.stats-fj.gov.cn/tongjinianjian/dz07/html/0100e.htm Fujian's General Information]. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140107052910/http://www.stats-fj.gov.cn/tongjinianjian/dz07/html/0100e.htm |date=7 January 2014 }}. Quote: "''At present, major religions practiced in Fujian include Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism. In addition, Fujian has its folk belief with deeply local characteristic, such as Mazuism, the belief in Mazu, (which) is very influential''".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wang Ye worship]], or the cult of the Silkworm Mother.&lt;ref&gt;Fan Lizhu.

This type of religion is prevalent in north China, where lineage religion is absent, private, or historically present only within families of southern origin, and patrilineal ties are based on [[agnatic seniority|seniority]],{{sfnb|Chau|2005|p=50|ps=. Discussing folk religion in [[Shanbei]]: «There were very few ancestral halls in the past in Shaanbei and none have been revived in the reform era, although there are isolated instances of the rewriting of lineage genealogies. Shaanbei people have never had domestic ancestral altars (except perhaps a few gentry families who might have brought this tradition from the South), even though in the past, as was common in North China, they kept collective ancestral tablets (''shenzhu'') or large cloth scrolls with drawings of ancestral tablets that they used during special occasions such as during the Lunar New Year's ancestral worship ceremony. There are visits to the graves of the immediate ancestors a few times a year on prescribed occasions such as the Cold Food (''hanshi'') / Clear and Bright (''qingming'') (Third Month Ninth) but Shaanbei people do not believe that their ancestors' souls are active forces capable of protecting, benefiting or troubling the living.»}}{{sfnb|Wu|2014|p=20|ps=. Quote: «[...] southern China refers to Fujian and Guangdong province and in some cases is expanded to include Guangxi, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Historically speaking, these areas had the strong lineage organizations and the territorial cult, compared to the rest of China in the late imperial period. These areas not only were the first to revive lineage and the territorial cult in the reform era, but also have the intensity and scale of revivals that cannot be matched by the other part of China. This phenomena is furthered referred as the southern model, based on the south-vs.-north model. The north model refers to the absence of landholding cooperative lineages that exist in the south.» Note 16: The south-vs.-north model comparison has been the thrust of historical and anthropological research. Cohen’s article on “Lineage organization in North China (1990)” offers the best summary on the contrast between the north model and the south model. He calls the north China model “the fixed genealogical mode of agnatic kinship.” By which, he means “patrilineal ties are figured on the basis of the relative seniority of descent lines so that the unity of the lineage as a whole is based upon a ritual focus on the senior descent line trace back to the founding ancestor, his eldest son, and the succession of eldest sons.” (ibid: 510) In contrast, the south China model is called “the associational mode of patrilineal kinship.” In this mode, all lines of descent are equal. “Access to corporate resources held by a lineage or lineage segment is based upon the equality of kinship ties asserted in the associational mode.” However, the distinction between the north and the south model is somewhat arbitrary. Some practices of the south model are found in north China. Meanwhile, the so-call north model is not exclusive to north China.

In this context, the deity societies or temple societies function as poles of the civil organism.&lt;ref name="Overmyer, 2009. pp. 12-13"&gt;Overmyer, 2009. pp. 12-13: "As for the physical and social structure of villages on this vast flat expanse; they consist of close groups of houses built on a raised area, surrounded by their fields, with a multi-surnamed population of families who own and cultivate their own land, though usually not much more than twenty ''mou'' or about three acres. [...] Families of different surnames living in one small community meant that lineages were not strong enough to maintain lineage shrines and cross-village organizations, so, at best, they owned small burial plots and took part only in intra-village activities. The old imperial government encouraged villages to manage themselves and collect and hand over their own taxes. [...] leaders were responsible for settling disputes, dealing with local government, organizing crop protection and planning for collective ceremonies. All these factors tended to strengthen the local protective deities and their temples as focal points of village identity and activity. This social context defines North China local religion, and keeps us from wandering off into vague discussions of ‘popular’ and ‘elite’ and relationships with Daoism and Buddhism."&lt;/ref&gt; Often deity societies incorporate entire villages; this is the reason why in north China can be found many villages which are named after deities and their temples, for example ''Léishénmiào'' village (雷神廟 "[Village of the] Temple of the Thunder God")  or ''Mǎshénmiàocūn'' (馬神廟村 "Village of the Temple of the Horse God").

{{Main|Chinese ancestral religion}}
Another dimension of the Chinese folk religion is based on family or genealogical worship of deities and ancestors in family altars or private temples (''simiao'' {{lang|zh|私廟}} or ''jiamiao'' {{lang|zh|家廟}}), or [[ancestral shrine]]s (''citang'' {{lang|zh|祠堂}} or ''zongci'' {{lang|zh|宗祠}}, or also ''zumiao'' {{lang|zh|祖廟}}).&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese lineage associations|Kinship associations or churches]] (''zōngzú xiéhuì'' 宗族協會), congregating people with the same [[Chinese surname|surname]] and belonging to the same [[Chinese kin|kin]], are the social expression of this religion: these lineage societies build temples where the deified ancestors of a certain group (for example the ''[[Chen (surname)|Chen]]s'' or the ''[[Lin (surname)|Lin]]s'') are enshrined and worshiped.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 14-15"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; These temples serve as centres of aggregation for people belonging to the same lineage, and the lineage body may provide a context of identification and mutual assistance for individual persons.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 14-15"/&gt;

The construction of large and elaborate ancestral temples traditionally represents a kin's wealth, influence and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar K. S. Yang has explored the ethno-political dynamism of this form of religion, through which people who become distinguished for their value and virtue are considered immortal and receive posthumous divine titles, and are believed to protect their descendants, inspiring a mythological lore for the collective memory of a family or kin.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 16"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

If their temples and their deities enshrined acquire popularity they are considered worthy of the virtue of ''ling'', "efficacy".&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 16"/&gt; Worship of ancestors (''[[jingzu]]'' {{lang|zh|敬祖}}) is observed nationally with large-scale rituals on [[Qingming Festival]] and other holidays.

This type of religion prevails in south China, where lineage bonds are stronger and the patrilineal hierarchy is not based upon seniority, and access to corporate resources held by a lineage is based upon the equality of all the lines of descent.{{sfnb|Wu|2014|p=20|ps=.

"The extent to which shamanism pervaded ancient Chinese society", says scholar Paul R. Goldin (2005), "is a matter of scholarly dispute, but there can be no doubt that many communities relied upon the unique talents of shamans for their quotidian spiritual needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mair | first1 = Victor H. | first2 = Nancy Shatzman | last2 = Steinhardt | first3 = Paul Rakita | last3 = Goldin | year = 2005 | title = Hawai'i Reader in Traditional Chinese Culture | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XdouAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=China+shamanic+tradition&amp;dq=China+shamanic+tradition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCDgeahUKEwiOg4jLzpzHAhWJHT4KHUrwCC4 | publisher = University of Hawai'i Press | location = Honolulu | isbn = 0824827856 | ref = none}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese usage distinguishes the [[Chinese shamanism|Chinese ''wu'' tradition]] or "Wuism" as it was called by [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot]]{{sfnb|De Groot|1892|pp=''passim'' vol. 6}} (巫教 ''wūjiào''; properly shamanic, with control over the gods) from the [[tongji (spirit medium)|''tongji'' tradition]] (童乩; mediumship, without control of the godly movement), and from non-Han Chinese Altaic shamanisms (薩滿教 ''sàmǎnjiào'') that are practised in northern provinces.

According to Andreea Chirita (2014), Confucianism itself, with its emphasis on hierarchy and ancestral rituals, derived from the shamanic discourse of the [[Shang dynasty]]. What Confucianism did was to marginalise the "dysfunctional" features of old shamanism. However, shamanic traditions continued uninterrupted within the folk religion and found precise and functional forms within Taoism.&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"&gt;Andreea Chirita. ''[http://aflls.ucdc.ro/I_2014/2Ant.pdf Antagonistic Discourses on Shamanic Folklore in Modern China]''. On: ''Annals of Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University'', issue 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Shang and [[Zhou dynasty]], shamans had a role in the political hierarchy, and were represented institutionally by the Ministry of Rites (大宗拍). The emperor was considered the supreme shaman, intermediating between the three realms of heaven, earth and man. The mission of a shaman (巫 ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'') is "to repair the dis-functionalities occurred in nature and generated after the sky had been separated from earth":&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"/&gt;

::«The female shamans called ''wu'' as well as the male shamans called ''xi'' represent the voice of spirits, repair the natural dis-functions, foretell the future based on dreams and the art of divination ... "a historical science of the future", whereas shamans are able to observe the yin and the yang ...»

Since the 1980s the practice and study of shamanism has undergone a massive revival in Chinese religion as a means to repair the world to a harmonious whole after industrialisation.&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"/&gt; Shamanism is viewed by many scholars as the foundation for the emergence of civilisation, and the shaman as "teacher and spirit" of peoples. The Chinese Society for Shamanic Studies was founded in [[Jilin City]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="KunShi2006"&gt;Kun Shi. ''[http://buddhabookclub.weebly.com/uploads/4/2/6/4/4264863/survey_of_shamanic_studies_in_china-1993-updated_2007.pdf Shamanistic Studies in China: A Preliminary Survey of the Last Decade] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926115658/http://buddhabookclub.weebly.com/uploads/4/2/6/4/4264863/survey_of_shamanic_studies_in_china-1993-updated_2007.pdf |date=26 September 2017 }}''.

{{Main|Confucianism|Taoism|Chinese ritual mastery traditions}}
Confucianism and Taoism—which are formalised, ritual, doctrinal or philosophical traditions—can be considered both as embedded within the larger category of Chinese religion, or as separate religions. In fact, one can practise certain folk cults and espouse the tenets of Confucianism as a philosophical framework, Confucian theology instructing to uphold the moral order through the worship of gods and ancestors&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, 2010. pp. 35-37&lt;/ref&gt; that is the way of connecting to the [[Tian]] and awakening to its harmony (''[[li (Confucian)|li]]'', "[[ṛta|rite]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tay, 2010. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk temples and ancestral shrines on special occasions may choose Confucian liturgy (that is called 儒 ''rú'', or sometimes 正統 ''zhèngtǒng'', meaning "[[orthopraxy|orthoprax]]" ritual style) led by Confucian "sages of rites" (禮生 ''lǐshēng'') who in many cases are the elders of a local community. Confucian liturgies are alternated with Taoist liturgies and popular ritual styles.{{sfnb|Clart|2003|p=3-5}}

There are many organised groups of the folk religion that adopt Confucian liturgy and identity, for example the [[Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition]] or phoenix churches (Luanism), or the [[Confucian churches]], schools and fellowships such as the ''Yīdān xuétáng'' (一耽學堂) of [[Beijing]],&lt;ref&gt;Sébastien Billioud.

Scholar and Taoist priest [[Kristofer Schipper]] defines Taoism as a "liturgical framework" for the development of local religion.&lt;ref name="Wu2014"&gt;Nengchang Wu.

On: ''Review of Religion and Chinese Society'' 1 (2014), 104-127. pp. 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Taoist schools|currents]] of Taoism are deeply interwoven with the Chinese folk religion, especially the [[Zhengyi Taoism|Zhengyi]] school, developing aspects of local cults within their doctrines;&lt;ref name="Wu2014"/&gt; however Taoists always highlight the distinction between their traditions and those which aren't Taoist. Priests of Taoism are called ''daoshi'' ({{lang|zh|道士}}), literally meaning "masters of the [[Tao]]", otherwise commonly translated simply the "Taoists", as common followers and folk believers who are not part of Taoist orders are not identified as such.

Taoists of the Zhengyi school, who are called ''sǎnjū dàoshi'' ({{lang|zh|散居道士}}) or ''huǒjū dàoshi'' ({{lang|zh|火居道士}}), respectively meaning "scattered daoshi" and "daoshi living at home (hearth)", because they can get married and perform the profession of priests as a part-time occupation, may perform rituals of offering (''jiao''), thanks-giving, propitiation, exorcism and rites of passage for local communities' temples and private homes.&lt;ref name="Davis-Daoists"&gt;Edward L.

[[Chinese ritual mastery traditions|Lineages of ritual masters]] ({{lang|zh|法師}} ''fashi''), also referred to as practitioners of "Faism", also called "Folk Taoism" or (in southeast China) "Red Taoism", operate within the Chinese folk religion but outside any institution of official Taoism.&lt;ref name="Pas, 2014. p. 259"/&gt; The ritual masters, who have the same role of the ''sanju daoshi'' within the fabric of society, aren't considered Taoist priests by the ''daoshi'' of Taoism who trace their lineage to the Celestial Masters and by Taoists officially registered with the state Taoist Church. ''Fashi'' are defined as of "[[kataphatic]]" (filling) character in opposition to professional Taoists who are "[[kenotic]]" (of emptying, or [[apophatic theology|apophatic]], character).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Coakley.

{{Main|Chinese salvationist religions}}
China has a long history of sect traditions characterised by a [[soteriology|soteriological]] and [[eschatology|eschatological]] character, often called "salvationist religions" (救度宗教 ''jiùdù zōngjiào''),&lt;ref name="Palmer, 2011. p. 19"&gt;Palmer, 2011. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; which emerged from the common religion but are neither ascribable to the lineage cult of [[ancestor]]s and [[progenitor]]s, nor to the communal deity religion of village temples, neighbourhood, corporation, or national temples.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th-century expression of this religions has been studied under [[Prasenjit Duara]]'s definition of "redemptive societies" (救世團體 ''jiùshì tuántǐ''),&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=395}} while modern Chinese scholarship describes them as "folk religious sects" (民間宗教 ''mínjiān zōngjiào'', 民間教門 ''mínjiān jiàomén'' or 民间教派 ''mínjiān jiàopài''),&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; abandoning the ancient derogatory definition of ''xiéjiào'' (邪教), "evil religion".&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

They are characterised by [[egalitarianism]], a foundation through a charismatic figure and a direct divine revelation, a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] eschatology and voluntary path of [[salvation]], an embodied experience of the numinous through healing and cultivation, and an expansive orientation through good deeds, [[evangelism]] and [[philanthropy]].&lt;ref name="Palmer, 2011. p. 19"/&gt; Their practices are focused on improving morality, body cultivation, and recitation of scriptures.&lt;ref name="Palmer, 2011. p. 19"/&gt;

Many of the redemptive religions of the 20th and 21st century aspire to become the repository of the entirety of the Chinese tradition in the face of Western modernism and materialism.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; This group of religions includes&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. pp. 4-6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yiguandao]] and other sects belonging to the [[Xiantiandao]] ({{lang|zh|先天道}} "Way of Former Heaven"), Jiugongdao ({{lang|zh|九宮道}} "Way of the Nine Palaces"), various proliferations of the [[Luo teaching]], the [[Zaili teaching]], and the more recent [[De teaching]], Weixinist, [[Xuanyuan teaching|Xuanyuan]] and [[Tiandi teachings]], the latter two focused respectively on the worship of [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] and the universal God. Also, the [[qigong]] schools are developments of the same religious context.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

These movements were banned in the early [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republican China]] and later Communist China. Many of them still remain illegal, underground or unrecognised in [[China]], while others—specifically the De teaching, Tiandi teachings, Xuanyuan teaching, Weixinism and Yiguandao—have developed cooperation with mainland China's academic and non-governmental organisations.&lt;ref name="RCTC2014"/&gt; The [[Sanyi teaching]] is an organised folk religion founded in the 16th century, present in the [[Putian]] region ([[Putian people|Xinghua]]) of [[Fujian]] where it is legally recognised.&lt;ref name="RCTC2014"/&gt; Some of these sects began to register as branches of the state Taoist Association since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 347"&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 347, quote: "[Since the 1990s] [...] a number of [...] [[Chinese salvationist religions|lay salvationist groups]] (such as Xiantiandao in southern China and Hongyangism [弘陽教 ''Hóngyáng jiào''] in Hebei) also successfully registered with the Taoist association, thus gaining legitimacy".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another category that has been sometimes confused with that of the sects of salvation by scholars, is that of the secret societies (會道門 ''huìdàomén'', 祕密社會 ''mìmì shèhuì'', or 祕密結社 ''mìmì jiéshè'').&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; They are religious communities of [[initiation|initiatory]] and secretive character, including rural militias such as the Red Spears (紅槍會) and the Big Knives (大刀會), and fraternal organisations such as the Green Gangs (青幫) and the Elders' Societies (哥老會).&lt;ref name="Palmer, 2011. p. 13"&gt;Palmer, 2011. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; They became very popular in the [[Republic of China (1912-49)|early republican period]], and often labeled as "[[heresy|heretical]] doctrines" (宗教異端 ''zōngjiào yìduān'').&lt;ref name="Palmer, 2011. p. 13"/&gt; Recent scholarship has created the label of "secret sects" (祕密教門 ''mìmì jiàomén'') to distinguish the peasant "secret societies" with a positive dimension of the Yuan, Ming and Qing periods, from the negatively viewed "secret societies" of the early republic that became instruments of anti-revolutionary forces (the [[Guomindang]] or [[Japan]]).&lt;ref name="Palmer, 2011. p. 13"/&gt;

A further distinctive type of sects of the folk religion, that are possibly the same as the positive "secret sects", are the martial sects. They combine two aspects: the ''wénchǎng'' (文場 "cultural field"), that is the doctrinal aspect characterised by elborate cosmologies, theologies, initiatory and ritual patterns, and that is usually kept secretive; and the ''wǔchǎng'' (武場 "martial field"), that is the body cultivation practice and that is usually the "public face" of the sect.&lt;ref name="Ambrosi2013"&gt;Raymond Ambrosi.

====Tiandi teachings====
The Tiandi teachings is a religion that encompasses two branches, the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue (天德聖教 ''Tiāndé shèngjiào'') and the Church of the Heavenly Deity (天帝教 ''Tiāndìjiào''), both emerged from the techings of Xiao Changming and Li Yujie, disseminated in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Vermander"&gt;Benoit Vermander. ''[http://www.theway.org.uk/Back/39Vermander.pdf Christianity and the Taiwanese Religious Landscape]''. On: ''The Way'', 39, 1999. London Society of Jesus. pp. 129-139&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is actually an outgrowth of the former established in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Vermander"/&gt;

The religions focus on the worship of ''Tiandi'' ({{lang|zh|天帝}}), the "Heavenly Deity" or "Heavenly Emperor",&lt;ref name="Vermander"/&gt; on health through the proper cultivation of [[qi]],&lt;ref name="Vermander"/&gt; and teach a style of qigong named ''Tianren qigong''.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyne Micollier.

Vincent Goossaert has recently (2011) published a review of scholarly works which study "north China folk religion" as a distinct phenomenon.&lt;ref name=GoossaertNCR&gt;{{cite journal | last = Goossaert | first = Vincent | authorlink = | title = Is There a North China Religion?

People worship and petition at both pilgrimages and local festivals for similar reasons. The chief differences between the two are the central role of a journey in pilgrimages, the size of the area from which participants are attracted, and the role of pilgrimage societies in organizing the long trips that may be involved. [...] pilgrimage in China is also characterized by extensive planning and organization both by the host temples and those visiting them."&lt;/ref&gt; and led by indigenous ritual masters (''fashi'') who are often hereditary and linked to secular authority.{{refn|group=note|Overmyer (2009, p. 73), says that from the late 19th to the 20th century few professional priests (i.e. licensed Taoists) were involved in local religion in the central and northern provinces of China, and discusses various types of folk ritual specialists including: the ''yuehu'' 樂戶, the ''zhuli'' 主禮 (p. 74), the ''shenjia'' 神家 ("godly families", hereditary specialists of gods and their rites; p. 77), then (p. 179) the ''yinyang'' or ''fengshui'' masters (as "[...] folk Zhengyi Daoists of the Lingbao scriptural tradition, living as ordinary peasants. They earn their living both as a group from performing public rituals, and individually [...] by doing geomancy and calendrical consultations for ''fengshui'' and auspicious days"; quoting: S. Jones (2007), ''Ritual and Music of North China: Shawm Bands in Shanxi''). He also describes shamans or media known by different names: ''mapi'' 馬裨, ''wupo'' 巫婆, ''shen momo'' 神嬤嬤 or ''shen han'' 神漢 (p. 87); ''xingdao de'' 香道的 ("practitioners of the incense way"; p. 85); village ''xiangtou'' 香頭 ("incense heads"; p. 86); ''matong'' 馬童 (the same as southern ''[[tongji (spirit medium)|jitong]]''), either ''wushen'' 巫神 (possessed by gods) or ''shenguan'' 神官 (possessed by immortals; pp. 88-89); or "godly sages" (''shensheng'' 神聖; p. 91). Further (p. 76), he discusses for example the ''sai'' 賽, ceremonies of thanksgiving to the gods in [[Shanxi]] with roots in the [[Song dynasty|Song era]], whose leaders very often corresponded to local political authorities. This pattern continues today with former village Communist Party secretaries elected as temple association bosses (p. 83). He concludes (p. 92): "In sum, since at least the early twentieth century the majority of local ritual leaders in north China have been products of their own or nearby communities. They have special skills in organization, ritual performance or interaction with the gods, but none are full-time ritual specialists; they have all ‘kept their day jobs’! As such they are exemplars of ordinary people organizing and carrying out their own cultural traditions, persistent traditions with their own structure, functions and logic that deserve to be understood as such."}}

Northern and southern folk religions also have a different [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], of which the northern one is composed of more ancient gods of [[Chinese mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Overmyer, 2009. p. 3: "[...] there are significant differences between aspects of local religion in the south and north, one of which is the gods who are worshiped."; p. 33: "[...] the veneration in the north of ancient deities attested to in pre-Han sources, deities such as Nüwa, Fuxi and Shennong, the legendary founder of agriculture and herbal medicine. In some instances these gods were worshiped at places believed to be where they originated, with indications of grottoes, temples and festivals for them, some of which continue to exist or have been revived. Of course, these gods were worshiped elsewhere in China as well, though perhaps not with the same sense of original geographical location."&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]] have historically been more successful in the central plains and in the northeastern provinces than in southern China, and central-northern folk religion shares characteristics of some of the sects, such as the heavy importance of [[Chinese mother goddess worship|mother goddess worship]] and shamanism,&lt;ref&gt;Overmyer, 2009. p. 15: «[...] Popular religious sects with their own forms of organization, leaders, deities, rituals, beliefs and scripture texts were active throughout the Ming and Qing periods, particularly in north China. Individuals and families who joined them were promised special divine protection in this life and the next by leaders who functioned both as ritual masters and missionaries. These sects were more active in some communities than in others, but in principle were open to all who responded to these leaders and believed in their efficacy and teachings, so some of these groups spread to wide areas of the country. [...] significant for us here though is evidence for the residual influence of sectarian beliefs and practices on non-sectarian community religion where the sects no longer exist, particularly the feminization of deities by adding to their names the characters ''mu'' or ''Laomu'', Mother or Venerable Mother, as in ''Guanyin Laomu'', ''Puxianmu'', ''Dizangmu'', etc., based on the name of the chief sectarian deity, ''Wusheng Laomu'', the Eternal Venerable Mother. ''Puxian'' and ''Dizang'' are bodhisattvas normally considered ‘male’, though in Buddhist theory such gender categories don’t really apply. This practice of adding ''mu'' to the names of deities, found already in Ming period sectarian scriptures called ''baojuan'' ‘precious volumes’ from the north, does not occur in the names of southern deities.»&lt;/ref&gt; as well as their scriptural transmission.&lt;ref name=GoossaertNCR/&gt;{{rp|92}} [[Confucian churches]] as well have historically found much resonance among the population of the northeast; in the 1930s the [[Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue]] alone aggregated at least 25% of the population of the state of [[Manchukuo|Manchuria]]{{sfnb|Ownby|2008}} and contemporary [[Shandong]] has been analysed as an area of rapid growth of folk Confucian groups.{{sfnb|Payette|2016}}

Along the southeastern coast, ritual functions of the folk religion are reportedly dominated by Taoism, both in registered and unregistered forms ([[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi Taoism]] and unrecognised ''fashi'' orders), which since the 1990s has developed quickly in the area.&lt;ref name="Chan, 2005. p. 93"&gt;Chan, 2005. p. 93. Quote: "By the early 1990s Daoist activities had become popular especially in rural areas, and began to get out of control as the line between legitimate Daoist activities and popular folk religious activities - officially regarded as feudal superstition - became blurred. [...] Unregulated activities can range from orthodox Daoist liturgy to shamanistic rites. The popularity of these Daoist activities underscores the fact that Chinese rural society has a long tradition of religiosity and has preserved and perpetuated Daoism regardless of official policy and religious institutions. With the growth of economic prosperity in rural areas, especially in the coastal provinces where Daoist activities are concentrated, with a more liberal policy on religion, and with the revival of local cultural identity, Daoism - be it the officially sanctioned variety or Daoist activities which are beyond the edge of the official Daoist body - seems to be enjoying a strong comeback, at least for the time being."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Overmyer-2009-southeast-Daoism"&gt;Overmyer, 2009. p. 185 about Taoism in southeastern China: "Ethnographic research into the temple festivals and communal rituals celebrated within these god cults has revealed the widespread distribution of Daoist ritual traditions in this area, including especially Zhengyi (Celestial Master Daoism) and variants of Lushan Daoist ritual traditions. Various Buddhist ritual traditions (Pu’anjiao, Xianghua married monks and so on) are practiced throughout this region, particularly for requiem services". (quoting K. Dean (2003) ''Local Communal Religion in Contemporary Southeast China'', in D.L. Overmyer (ed.) ''Religion in China Today''. China Quarterly Special Issues, New Series, No. 3. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 32–34.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Goossaert talks of this distinction, although recognising it as an oversimplification, of a "Taoist south" and a "village-religion/Confucian centre-north",&lt;ref name=GoossaertNCR/&gt;{{rp|47}} with the northern context also characterised by important orders of "folk Taoist" ritual masters, one of which are the 陰陽生 ''yīnyángshēng'' ("sages of yin and yang"),&lt;ref name=Jones2011&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jones | first = Stephen | authorlink = | title = Yinyang: Household Daoists of North China and Their Rituals | journal = Daoism: Religion, History &amp; Society | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–114 | publisher = | location = | date = 2011 | language = | url = | jstor = | ISSN = | doi = | accessdate = | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GoossaertNCR/&gt;{{rp|86}} and sectarian traditions,&lt;ref name=GoossaertNCR/&gt;{{rp|92}} and also by a low influence of Buddhism and official Taoism.&lt;ref name=GoossaertNCR/&gt;{{rp|90}}

The [[Northeast China folk religion|folk religion of northeast China]] has unique characteristics deriving from the interaction of Han religion with [[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]] and [[Manchu shamanism]]s; these include ''chūmǎxiān'' (出馬仙 "riding for the immortals") shamanism, the worship of foxes and other [[animal worship|zoomorphic deities]], and the [[Huxian|Fox Gods]] (狐神 ''Húshén'')—Great Lord of the Three Foxes (胡三太爺 ''Húsān Tàiyé'') and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes (胡三太奶 ''Húsān Tàinǎi'')—at the head of pantheons.&lt;ref name="Deng-chumaxian"&gt;{{cite thesis | last = Deng | first = Claire Qiuju | date = 2014 | title = Action-Taking Gods: Animal Spirit Shamanism in Liaoning, China | type = Master in East Asian Studies | publisher = McGill University, Department of East Asian Studies | location = Montreal | url = http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&amp;dvs=1514765798473~395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, in the [[religion in Inner Mongolia|religious context of Inner Mongolia]] there has been a significant integration of Han Chinese into the traditional folk religion of the region.

In recent years there has also been an assimilation of deities from [[Tibetan folk religion]], especially wealth gods.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Juergensmeyer, Wade Clark Roof.

SAGE Publications, 2011. {{ISBN|1452266565}}. p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], across broader [[western China]], and in [[Inner Mongolia]], there has been a growth of the cult of [[Gesar]] with the explicit support of the Chinese government, a cross-ethnic Han-Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu deity (the Han identify him as an aspect of the god of war analogically with [[Guan Yu|Guandi]]) and [[culture hero]] whose mythology is embodied as a culturally important [[epic poem]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny.

===="Taoised" indigenous religions of ethnic minorities====

Chinese religion has both influenced, and in turn has been influenced by, indigenous religions of ethnic groups that the Han Chinese have encountered along their ethnogenetic history. Seiwert (1987) finds evidence of pre-Chinese religions in the folk religion of certain southeastern provinces such as Fujian and Taiwan, especially in the local ''wu'' and lineages of ordained ritual masters.&lt;ref name=Seiwert1987&gt;{{citation | last = Seiwert | first = Hubert | chapter = On the religions of national minorities in the context of China's religious history | pages = 41–51 | title = Ethnic Minorities in China: Tradition and Transform.

A process of [[sinicization]], or more appropriately a "Taoisation", is also the more recent experience of the indigenous religions of some distinct [[ethnic minorities of China]], especially southwestern people. Chinese Taoists gradually penetrate within the indigenous religions of such peoples, in some cases working side by side with indigenous priests, in other cases taking over the latter's function and integrating them by requiring their ordination as Taoists.&lt;ref name=Seiwert1987/&gt;{{rp|45}} Usually, indigenous ritual practices remain unaffected and are adopted into Taoist liturgy, while indigenous gods are identified with Chinese gods.&lt;ref name=Seiwert1987/&gt;{{rp|47}} Seiwert discusses this phenomenon of "merger into Chinese folk religion" not as a mere elimination of non-Chinese indigenous religions, but rather as a cultural re-orientation. Local priests of southwestern ethnic minorities often acquire prestige by identifying themselves as Taoists and adopting Taoist holy texts.&lt;ref name=Seiwert1987/&gt;{{rp|47}}

Mou (2012) writes that "Taoism has formed an indissoluble bond" with indigenous religions of southwestern ethnic minorities, especially the Tujia, [[Yi people|Yi]] and [[Yao people|Yao]].{{sfnb|Mou|2012|p=57}} Seiwert mentions the [[Miao people|Miao]] of [[Hunan]].&lt;ref name=Seiwert1987/&gt;{{rp|45}} "Daogongism" is Taoism among the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], directed by the ''dàogōng'' (道公 "lords of the Tao") and it forms an established important aspect of the broader [[Zhuang folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ya-ning Kao, ''Religious Revival among the Zhuang People in China: Practising "Superstition" and Standardizing a Zhuang Religion'' ''Journal of Current Chinese Affairs'', 43, 2, 107–144. 2014. {{ISSN|1868-4874}} (online), {{ISSN|1868-1026}} (print). p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it is also true that in more recent years there has been a general revival of indigenous lineages of ritual masters without identification of these as Taoists and support from the state Chinese Taoist Church. An example is the revival of lineages of ''bimo'' ("scripture sages") priests among the Yi peoples. [[Bimoism]] has a tradition of theological literature and though clergy ordination, and this is among the reasons why it is taken in high consideration by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Kraef.

Chinese religions are [[polytheism|polytheistic]], meaning that many deities are worshipped as part of what has been defined as ''yǔzhòu shénlùn'' (宇宙神論), translated as "[[Pantheism|cosmotheism]]", a worldview in which divinity is inherent to the world itself.&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 71"/&gt; The gods (''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' 神; "growth", "beings that give birth"&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 63"&gt;Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;) are interwoven energies or principles that generate phenomena which reveal or reproduce the way of Heaven, that is to say the order (''[[li (Confucianism)|li]]'') of the Greatnine(''[[Tian]]'').{{refn|group=note|name=names of Heaven}}

In Chinese tradition, there is not a clear distinction between the gods and their physical body or bodies (from stars to trees and animals);&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 158"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; the qualitative difference between the two seems not to have ever been emphasised.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 158"/&gt; Rather, the disparity is said to be more quantitative than qualitative.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 158"/&gt; In doctrinal terms, the Chinese view of gods is related to the understanding of ''[[qi]]'', the life force,&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 158"/&gt; as the gods and their phenomenal productions are manifestations of it.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 158"/&gt; In this way, all natural bodies are believed to be able to attain supernatural attributes by acting according to the universal oneness.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 158"/&gt; Meanwhile, acting wickedly (that is to say against the Tian and its order) brings to disgrace and disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

In folk religions, gods (''shen'') and immortals (''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' 仙) are not specifically distinguished from each other.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 161"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Gods can incarnate in human form and human beings can reach immortality, which means to attain higher spirituality, since all the spiritual principles (gods) are begotten of the primordial ''qi'' before any physical manifestation.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 159"/&gt;

In the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', one of the Confucian four books, the ''[[zhenren]]'' (wise) is the man who has achieved a spiritual status developing his true sincere nature.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 162"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; This status, in turn, enables him to fully develop the true nature of others and of all things.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 162"/&gt; The sage is able to "assist the transforming and nourishing process of Heaven and Earth", forming a trinity (三才 ''Sāncái'', the "Three Powers") with them.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 162"/&gt; In other words, in the Chinese tradition humans are or can be the medium between Heaven and Earth, and have the role of completing what had been initiated.{{refn|group=note|name=Sancai}}

Taoist schools in particular espouse an explicit spiritual pathway which pushes the earthly beings to the edge of eternity.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 164"/&gt; Since the human body is a microcosm, enlivened by the universal order of yin and yang like the whole cosmos, the means of immortality can be found within oneself.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 164"/&gt;

Among those worshipped as immortal heroes (''xian'', exalted beings) are historical individuals distinguished for their worth or bravery, those who taught crafts to others and formed societies establishing the order of Heaven, ancestors or progenitors (''zu'' 祖), and the creators of a spiritual tradition.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 162, p. 165"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 38: ''Xian'' are described as individuals who achieve mastery of the way of Heaven and emulate it.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "human divinity" is not self-contradictory, as there is no unbridgeable gap between the two realms; rather, the divine and the human are mutually contained.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 162"/&gt;

In comparison with gods of an environmental nature, who tend to remain stable throughout human experience and history, individual human deities change in time. Some endure for centuries, while others remain localised cults, or vanish after a short time.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 158"/&gt; Immortal beings are conceived as "constellations of [[qi]]", which is so vibrant in certain historical individuals that, upon the person's death, this ''qi'' nexus does not dissipate but persists, and is reinforced by living people's worship.&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Raymond Barnett. ''Relax, You're Already Home: Everyday Taoist Habits For A Richer Life''. J. P. Tarcher, 2004. {{ISBN|1585423661}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energetic power of a god is thought to reverberate on the worshipers influencing their fortune.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;

====Deities and immortals====
[[File:Doumu altar and statue at the Doumugong of Butterworth, Penang.jpg|thumb|Main altar and statue of [[Doumu]] inside the Temple of Doumu in [[Butterworth, Penang]], [[Malaysia]].]]

Gods and immortals (collectively 神仙 ''shénxiān'') in the Chinese cultural tradition reflect a hierarchical, [[multiperspectivity|multiperspective]] experience of divinity.&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 63"/&gt; In Chinese language there is a terminological distinction between 神 ''shén'', 帝 ''dì'' and 仙 ''xiān''. Although the usage of the former two is sometimes blurred, it corresponds to the distinction in Western cultures between "god" and "deity", Latin ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'' (meaning a generative principle, "spirit") and ''[[deus]]'' or ''divus''; ''dì'', sometimes translated as "[[:wiktionary:thearch|thearch]]", implies a manifested or incarnate "godly" power.{{refn|group=note|The term "thearch" is from Greek ''theos'' ("deity"), with ''[[arche]]'' ("principle", "origin"), thus meaning "divine principle", "divine origin". In sinology it has been used to designate the incarnated gods who, according to Chinese tradition, sustain the world order and originated China. It is one of the alternating translations of 帝 ''dì'', together with "emperor" and "god".{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=504, vol. 2 A-L|ps=: Each sector of heaven (the four points of the compass and the center) was personified by a ''di'' 帝 (a term which indicates not only an emperor but also an ancestral "thearch" and "god").}}}}{{sfnb|Medhurst|1847|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kw1gAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 260]}} It is etymologically and figuratively analogous to the concept of ''di'' as the base of a fruit, which falls and produces other fruits. This analogy is attested in the ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'' explaining "deity" as "what faces the base of a melon fruit".{{sfnb|Zhao|2012|p=51}} The latter term 仙 ''xiān'' unambiguously means a man who has reached immortality, similarly to the Western idea of "[[hero]]".

Many classical books have lists and hierarchies of gods and immortals, among which the "Completed Record of Deities and Immortals" (神仙通鑒 ''Shénxiān tōngjiàn'') of the [[Ming dynasty]],&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 159"/&gt; and the "[[Biographies of Deities and Immortals]]" (神仙傳 ''Shénxiān zhuán'') by [[Ge Hong]] (284-343).&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 161"/&gt; There's also the older ''[[Liexian zhuan]]'' (列仙傳 "Collected Biographies of Immortals").

There are the great cosmic gods representing the first principle in its unmanifested state or its creative order—[[Yudi]] (玉帝 "Jade Deity"){{refn|group=note|name=king-emperor-shaman-axis}} and [[Doumu]] (斗母 "Mother of the Meaning" or "Great Chariot"), [[Pangu]] (盤古, the [[macranthropy|macranthropic]] metaphor of the cosmos), [[Xiwangmu]] (西王母 "Queen Mother of the West") and Dongwanggong (東王公 "King Duke of the East") who personificate respectively the yin and the yang,{{sfnb|Fowler|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=9wi-ZDdmaqEC&amp;dq=isbn%3A1845190866&amp;q=Xiwangmu#v=snippet&amp;q=Xiwangmu&amp;f=false 206-207]}} as well as the dimensional Three Patrons and the [[Wufang Shangdi|Five Deities]]; then there are the sky and weather gods, the scenery gods,  the vegetal and animal gods, and gods of human virtues and crafts.&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 71"/&gt; These are interpreted in different ways in Taoism and [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk sects]], the former conferring them long [[kataphatic]] names.&lt;ref name="Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 71"/&gt; Below the great deities, there is the unquantifiable number of gods of nature, as every phenomena have or are gods.

The Three Patrons (三皇 ''Sānhuáng'')—[[Fuxi]], [[Nüwa]] and [[Shennong]]—are the "vertical" manifestation of the primordial God corresponding to the Three Realms (三界 ''Sānjiè''), representing the yin and yang and the medium between them, that is the human being.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Chinese Religions'', 24-25, 1996. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Deities (五帝 ''Wǔdì'') or "Five Forms of the Highest Deity" (五方上帝 ''Wǔfāng Shàngdì'')—the Yellow, Green or Blue, [[Heidi (god)|Black]], Red and White Deities{{sfnb|Medhurst|1847|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kw1gAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 260]}}—are the five "horizontal" manifestations of the primordial God and according with the Three Realms they have a celestial, a terrestrial and a chthonic form.{{refn|group=note|The natural order emanating from the primordial God (Tian-Shangdi) inscribing and designing worlds as ''tán'' 壇, "altar", the Chinese concept equivalent of the Indian ''[[mandala]]''.

The diagram illustrated above is based on the ''[[Huainanzi]]''.{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=121}}}} They correspond to the [[Wu Xing|five phases of creation]], the [[Four Symbols (China)|five constellations rotating around the celestial pole]], the [[Sacred Mountains of China|five sacred mountains]] and the five directions of space (the four [[cardinal direction]]s and the centre), and the five Dragon Gods (龍神 ''Lóngshén'') which represent their mounts, that is to say the chthonic forces they preside over.{{sfnb|Little|Eichman|2000|p=250|ps=. It describes a [[Ming dynasty]] painting representing (among other figures) the Wudi: "In the foreground are the gods of the Five Directions, dressed as emperors of high antiquity, holding tablets of rank in front of them. [...] These gods are significant because they reflect the cosmic structure of the world, in which ''yin'', ''yang'' and the Five Phases (Elements) are in balance. They predate religious Taoism, and may have originated as chthonic gods of the Neolithic period. Governing all directions (east, south, west, north and center), they correspond not only to the Five Elements, but to the seasons, the Five Sacred Peaks, the Five Planets, and zodiac symbols as well. [...]".}}{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=87lvBoFi8A0C&amp;q=Huangdi#v=snippet&amp;q=Huangdi&amp;f=false 120-123]}}

====Mother goddess worship====
[[File:碧霞祠.jpg|thumb|Shrine of Bixia at [[Mount Tai]], [[Shandong]].]]
The worship of [[mother goddess]]es for the cultivation of offspring is present all over China, but predominantly in northern provinces. There are nine main goddesses, and all of them tend to be considered as manifestations or attendant forces of a singular goddess identified variously as Bixia (碧霞 "Blue Dawn"), the daughter or female consort of the Green God of Mount Tai, or [[Houtu]] (后土 the "Queen of the Earth").&lt;ref name="Jones, 2013. pp. 166-167"&gt;Jones, 2013. pp. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt; Bixia herself is identified by Taoists as the more ancient goddess [[Xiwangmu]],&lt;ref&gt;Louis Komjathy. ''The Daoist Tradition: An Introduction''. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2013. {{ISBN|1441196455}}. Chapter: ''Daoist deities and pantheons''.&lt;/ref&gt; Goddesses are commonly entitled ''mǔ'' (母 "mother"), ''lǎomǔ'' (老母 "old mother"), ''shèngmǔ'' (聖母 "holy mother"), ''niángniáng'' (娘娘 "lady"), ''nǎinai'' (奶奶 "granny").

Altars of goddess worship are usually arranged with Bixia at the center and two goddesses at her sides, most frequently the Lady of Eyesight and the Lady of Offspring.&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;Ann Elizabeth Barrott Wicks. ''Children in Chinese Art''. University of Hawaii Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0824823591}}. pp. 149-150; some goddesses are enlisted in the note 18 at p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; A different figure but with the same astral connections as Bixia is the Qixing Niangniang (七星娘娘 "Goddess of the Seven Stars"). There is also the cluster of the Holy Mothers of the Three Skies (三霄聖母 ''Sanxiao Shengmu''; or "Ladies of the Three Skies", 三霄娘娘 ''Sanxiao Niangniang''), composed of ''Yunxiao Guniang'', ''Qiongxiao Guniang'' and ''Bixiao Guniang''.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=135}} In southeastern provinces the cult of Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑) is identified by some scholars as an emanation of the northern cult of Bixia.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hackin. ''Asiatic Mythology: A Detailed Description and Explanation of the Mythologies of All the Great Nations of Asia''. Asian Educational Services, 1932. {{ISBN|8120609204}}. pp. 349.350&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other local goddesses with motherly features, including the northern Canmu (蠶母 "Silkworm Mother") and [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] (媽祖 "Ancestral Mother"), popular in provinces along the eastern coast and in Taiwan. The title of "Queen of Heaven" (天后 ''Tiānhòu'') is most frequently attributed to Mazu and Doumu (the cosmic goddess).

===Worship and modalities of religious practice===

Adam Yuet Chau identifies five styles or modalities of "doing" Chinese religion:{{sfnb|Chau|2011}}
* Discursive-scriptural: involving the composition, preaching, and recitation of texts ([[Chinese classics|classics]], Taoist scriptures and morality books);
* Personal cultivation mode, involving a long-term cultivation and transformation of oneself with the goal of becoming a ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' 仙 (immortal), ''[[zhenren]]'' 真人 ("true person"), or ''shengren'' (wise), through the practice of different "technologies of the self" (''[[qigong]]'' 氣功, [[Chinese alchemy|Taoist inner and outer alchemy]], charitable acts for merit, memorisation and recitation of texts);
* Liturgical: involving elaborate ritual procedures conducted by specialists of rites (Taoist rites, Confucian rites, Nuo rites, ''[[fengshui]]'' 風水);
* Immediate practical: aiming at quick efficacious (''ling'' 靈) results through simple ritual and magical techniques ([[divination]], [[talisman]]s, divine medicine, consulting media and shamans);
* Relational: emphasising the devotional relationship between men and deities and among men themselves (organising elaborate [[sacrifice]]s, making vows, organising temple festivals, [[pilgrimage]]s, processions, and religious communities) in "social comings and goings" (''laiwang'' 來往) and "interconnectedness" (''[[guanxi]]'' 關係).

Generally speaking, the Chinese believe that spiritual and material well-being ensues from the harmony of humanity and gods in their participation in the same cosmic power, and also believe that by taking the right path and practice anybody is able to reach the absolute reality.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 173"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Religious practice is therefore regarded as the bridge to link the human world to the spiritual source,&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 173"/&gt; maintaining the harmony of the micro and macrocosmos, protecting the individual and the world from disruption.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183"/&gt; In this sense, the Chinese view of human life is not deterministic, but one is a master of his own life and can choose to collaborate with the deities for a harmonious world.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183"/&gt;
Chinese culture being a [[holism|holistic]] system, in which every aspect is a part of a whole, Chinese folk religious practice is often intermingled with political, educational and economic concerns.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 172"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; A gathering or event may be encompassed with all of these aspects; in general, the commitment (belief) and the process or rite (practice) together form the internal and external dimensions of Chinese religious life.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 172"/&gt; In village communities, religious services are often organised and led by local people themselves.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9"/&gt; Leaders are usually selected among male heads of families or lineages, or village heads.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9"/&gt;

A simple form of individual practice is to show respect for the gods (''jing shen'' {{lang|zh|敬神}}) through ''[[jingxiang]]'' (incense offering), and the exchange of vows (''huan yuan'' {{lang|zh|還願}}).&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183"/&gt; Sacrifice can consist of incense, oil, and candles, as well as money.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10"&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Religious devotion may also express in the form of performance troupes (''huahui''), involving many types of professionals such as stilt walkers, lion dancers, musicians, martial arts masters, ''[[yangge]]'' dancers, and story-tellers.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10"/&gt;

Deities can also be respected through moral deeds in their name (''shanshi'' {{lang|zh|善事}}), and self-cultivation (''xiuxing'' {{lang|zh|修行}}).&lt;ref&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of folk religion develop clear prescriptions for believers, such as detailed lists of meritorious and sinful deeds in the form of "morality books" (''shanshu'' {{lang|zh|善書}}) and ledgers of merit and demerit.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182"&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Involvement in the affairs of communal or intra-village temples are perceived by believers as ways for accumulating merit (''gongde'' {{lang|zh|功德}}).&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182"/&gt; Virtue is believed to accumulate in one's heart, which is seen as energetic centre of the human body (''zai jun xin zuo tian fu'' {{lang|zh|在君心作福田}}).&lt;ref&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Practices of communication with the gods comprehend different forms of Chinese shamanism, such as [[wu (shaman)|''wu'' shamanism]] and [[tongji (spirit medium)|''tongji'' mediumship]], or ''[[fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]'' practice.

====Sacrifices====
[[Classical Chinese]] has characters for different types of [[sacrifice]], probably the oldest way to communicate with divine forces, today generally encompassed by the definition ''jìsì'' 祭祀.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 173"/&gt; However different in scale and quantity, all types of sacrifice would normally involve food, wine, meat and later incense.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 176"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrifices usually differ according to the kind of deity they are devoted to.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 176"/&gt; Traditionally, cosmic and nature gods are offered uncooked (or whole) food, while ancestors are offered cooked food.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 176"/&gt; Moreover, sacrifices for gods are made inside the temples that enshrine them, while sacrifices for ancestors are made outside temples.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 176"/&gt; Yearly sacrifices (''ji'') are made to Confucius, the Red and Yellow Emperors, and other cultural heroes and ancestors.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 176"/&gt;

Both in past history and at the present, all sacrifices are assigned with both religious and political purposes.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 177"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Some gods are considered carnivorous, for example the River God (河神 ''Héshén'') and Dragon Gods, and offering to them requires animal sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 189"&gt;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thanksgiving and redeeming====
The aims of rituals and sacrifices may be of thanksgiving and redeeming, usually involving both.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 177"/&gt; Various sacrifices are intended to express gratitude toward the gods in the hope that spiritual blessing and protection will continue.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 177"/&gt; The ''jiào'' 醮, an elaborate Taoist sacrifice or "rite of universal salvation", is intended to be a cosmic community renewal, that is to say a reconciliation of a community around its spiritual centre.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 178"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The ''jiao'' ritual usually starts with ''zhai'', "fasting and purification", that is meant as an atonement for evil-doing, then followed by sacrificial offerings.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 178"/&gt;

This rite, of great political importance, can be intended for the whole nation.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 178"/&gt; In fact, as early as the [[Song dynasty]], emperors asked renowned Taoists to perform such rituals on their behalf or for the entire nation.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 178"/&gt; The modern Chinese republic has given approval for Taoists to conduct such rituals since the 1990s, with the aim of protecting the country and the nation.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 178"/&gt;

====Rites of passage====
[[File:明制冠禮.jpg|thumb|''[[Guan Li]]'', Confucian [[coming of age]] ceremony.]]
A variety of practices are concerned with personal well-being and spiritual growth.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 180"&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rites of passage]] are intended to narrate the holy significance of each crucial change throughout a life course.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 180"/&gt; These changes, which are physical and social and at the same time spiritual, are marked by elaborate customs and religious rituals.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 180"/&gt;

In the holistic view about nature and the human body and life, as macro and microcosmos, the life process of a human being is equated with the rhythm of seasons and cosmic changes.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 180"/&gt; Hence, birth is likened to spring, youth to summer, maturity to autumn and old age to winter.&lt;ref name="Yao, 2010. p. 180"/&gt; There are ritual passages for those who belong to a religious order of priests or monks, and there are the rituals of the stages in a life, the main four being birth, adulthood, marriage and death.&lt;ref&gt;Yao, 2010. p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Chinese temple}}
Chinese language has a variety of words defining the temples of the Chinese religion. Some of these terms have a precise functional use, although with time some confusion has arisen and some of them have been used interchangeably in some contexts. Collective names defining "temples" or places of worship are 寺廟 ''sìmiào'' and 廟宇 ''miàoyǔ''.{{sfnb|Li|2009}}

However, 寺 ''sì'', which originally meant a type of residence for imperial officials, with the introduction of [[Buddhism in China]] became associated with Buddhist monasteries as many officials donated their residences to the monks.{{sfnb|Li|2009}} Today ''sì'' and 寺院 ''sìyuàn'' ("monastery") are used almost exclusively for Buddhist monasteries, with sporadic exceptions, and ''sì'' is a component character of names for [[Chinese mosques]]. Another term now mostly associated with Buddhism is 庵 ''ān'', "thatched hut", originally a form of dwelling of monks later extended to mean monasteries.{{sfnb|Li|2009}}

Temples can be public, private (私廟 ''sìmiào'') and household temples (家廟 jiāmiào). The ''jing'' 境 is a broader "territory of a god", a geographic region or a village or city with its surroundings, marked by multiple temples or complexes of temples and delineated by the processions.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=25}}

Pertaining to Chinese religion the most common term is 廟 ''miào'' graphically meaning a "shrine" or "sacred enclosure"; it is the general Chinese term that is translated with the general Western "[[temple]]", and is used for temples of any of the deities of polytheism. Other terms include 殿 ''diàn'' which indicates the "house" of a god, enshrining one specific god, usually a chapel within a larger temple or sacred enclosure; and 壇 ''tán'' which means "[[altar]]" and refers to any indoor or outdoor altars, majestic outdoor altars being those for the worship of Heaven and Earth and other gods of the environment.{{sfnb|Li|2009}} 宮 ''Gōng'', originally referring to imperial palaces, became associated to temples of representations of the universal God or the highest gods and consorts, such as the Queen of Heaven.{{sfnb|Li|2009}}

Another group of words is used for the [[ancestral shrine|temples of ancestral religion]]: 祠 ''cí'' (either "temple" or "shrine", meaning a sacred enclosure) or 宗祠 ''zōngcí'' ("ancestor shrine"). These terms are also used for temples dedicated to [[xian (Taoism)|immortal beings]].{{sfnb|Li|2009}} 祖廟 ''Zǔmiào'' ("original temple") instead refers to a temple which is believed to be the original temple of a deity, the most legitimate and powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Chee-Beng. ''Tianhou and the Chinese in Diaspora''. Chapter in the ''Routledge Handbook of the Chinese Diaspora''. Routledge, 2013. {{ISBN|1136230963}}. p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;

堂 ''Táng'', meaning "hall" or "church hall", originally referred to the central hall of secular buildings but it entered religious usage as a place of worship of the [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]].{{sfnb|Li|2009}} [[Christianity in China]] has borrowed this term from the sects.

觀 ''Guàn'' is the appropriate Chinese translation of the Western term "temple", as both refer to "[[contemplation]]" (of the divine, according to the astral patterns in the sky or the icon of a deity). Together with its extension 道觀 ''dàoguàn'' ("to contemplate or observe the Dao"), it is used exclusively for [[Taoist temple]]s and monasteries of the state [[Taoist Church]].{{sfnb|Li|2009}}

Generic terms include 院 ''yuàn'' meaning "sanctuary", from the secular usage for a courtyard, college or hospital institution; 岩 ''yán'' ("rock") and 洞 ''dòng'' ("hole", "cave") referring to temples set up in caves or on cliffs. Other generic terms are 府 ''fǔ'' ("house"), originally of imperial officials, which is a rarely used term; and 亭 ''tíng'' ("pavilion") which refers to the areas of a temple where laypeople can stay.{{sfnb|Li|2009}} There is also 神祠 ''shéncí'', "shrine of a god".

Ancestral shrines are sacred places in which lineages of related families, identified by shared [[Chinese surname|surnames]], worship their common progenitors. These temples are the "collective representation" of a group, and function as centers where religious, social and economic activities intersect.&lt;ref&gt;Zai Liang, Steven Messner, Cheng Chen, Youqin Huang. ''The Emergence of a New Urban China: Insiders' Perspectives''. Lexington Books, 2013. {{ISBN|0739188089}}. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese temples are traditionally built according to the styles and materials (wood and bricks) of [[Chinese architecture]], and this continues to be the rule for most of the new temples. However, in the early 20th century and especially in the mainland religious revival of the early 21st century, there has been a proliferation of new styles in temple construction. These include the use of new materials (stones and concrete, stainless steel and glass) and the combination of Chinese traditional shapes with styles of the West or of transnational modernity. Examples can be found in the large ceremonial complexes of mainland China.

====Temple networks and gatherings====
[[File:GwongFuMiuWui (SingWongMiu).jpg|thumb|Gathering at a Temple of the City God of [[Guangzhou]], Guangdong.]]
{{Main|Fenxiang|Miaohui}}
分香 ''Fēnxiāng'', meaning an "incense division", is a term that defines both hierarchical networks of temples dedicated to a god, and the ritual process by which these networks form.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}} These temple networks are economic and social bodies, and in certain moments of history have even taken military functions.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}} They also represent routes of [[pilgrimage]], with communities of devotees from the affiliated temples going up in the hierarchy to the senior temple (''zumiao'').{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}}

When a new temple dedicated to the same god is founded, it enters the network through the ritual of division of incense. This consists in filling the incense burner of the new temple with ashes brought from the incense burner of an existing temple.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}} The new temple is therefore spiritually affiliated to the older temple where the ashes were taken, and directly below it in the hierarchy of temples.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}}

廟會 ''Miàohuì'', literally "gatherings at the temple", are "collective rituals to greet the gods" (迎神賽會 ''yíngshén sàihuì'') that are held at the temples on various occasione such as the [[Chinese New Year]] or the birthday or holiday of the god enshrined in the temple.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book |last = Davis |first = Edward L. |year = 2009 |title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture |publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2rLBvrlKI7QC |isbn = 041577716X |ref = harv}} pp. 815-816&lt;/ref&gt; In north Chine they are also called 賽會 ''sàihuì'' ("communal ritual gatherings") or 香會 ''xiānghuì'' ("incense gatherings"), while a 賽社 ''sàishè'' ("communal ritual body") is the association which organises such events and by extension it has become another name of the event itself.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=94}}

Activities include rituals, theatrical performances, processions of the gods' images throughout villages and cities, and offerings to the temples.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; In north China temple gatherings are generally week-long and large events attracting tens of thousands of people, while in south China they tend to be smaller and village-based events.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

[[File:河北梅花圣地师祖殿.jpg|thumb|Temple of the Founding Father (師祖殿 ''Shīzǔdiàn'') of the principal holy see (聖地 ''shèngdì'') of the [[Meihuaism|Plum Flower]] folk religious sect in [[Xingtai]], [[Hebei]].]]
According to Yang and Hu (2012):
::«Chinese folk religion deserves serious research and better understanding in the social scientific study of religion. This is not only because of the sheer number of adherents—several times more adherents than Christians and Buddhists combined, but also because folk religion may have significant social and political functions in China's transition.»{{sfnb|Yang|Hu|2012|p=505}}

According to their research, 55.5% of the adult population (15+) of China, or 578 million people in absolute numbers, believe and practise folk religions, including a 20% who practice ancestor religion or communal worship of deities, and the rest who practise what Yang and Hu define "individual" folk religions like devotion to specific gods such as [[Caishen]]. Members of folk religious sects are not taken into account.{{sfnb|Yang|Hu|2012|p=514}} Around the same year, Kenneth Dean estimates 680 million people involved in folk religion, or 51% of the total population.{{refn|group=note|Scholar Kenneth Dean estimates 680 million people involved in folk temples and rituals. Quote: «According to Dean, "in the rural sector... if one takes a rough figure of 1000 people per village living in 680,000 administrative villages and assume an average of two or three temples per village, one arrives at a figure of over 680 million villagers involved in some way with well over a million temples and their rituals".»&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8. Citing: Dean, Kenneth. ''Local Ritual Traditions of Southeast China: A Challenge to Definitions of Religion and Theories of Ritual''. In: ''Social Scientific Study of Religion in China: Methodology, Theories, and Findings'', eds. Fenggang Yang and Graeme Lang, 133-165, Leiden: Brill, 2011. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;}} At the same time, self-identified folk religion believers in Taiwan are 42.7% of the adult (20+) population, or 16 million people in absolute numbers, although devotion to ancestors and gods can be found even among other religions' believers or 88% of the population.{{sfnb|Yang|Hu|2012|p=514}} According to the 2005 census of Taiwan, Taoism is the statistical religion of 33% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Taiwan Yearbook 2006 |publisher = Government of Information Office |year= 2006 |url = http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/22Religion.htm |accessdate = 2007-09-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070708213510/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/22Religion.htm |archivedate = 8 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Spiritual Life Survey conducted by the Center on Religion and Chinese Society of [[Purdue University]], published in 2010, found that 754 million people (56.2%) practise ancestor religion, but only 216 million people (16%) "believe in the existence" of the ancestor.{{refn|group=note|However, there is considerable discrepancy between what Chinese and Western cultures intend with the concepts of "belief", "existence" and "practice". The Chinese folk religion is often considered one of "belonging" rather than "believing" (see: Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5.)}} The same survey says that 173 million (13%) practise Chinese folk religion in a Taoist framework.&lt;ref name="CSLS2010"&gt;2010 Chinese Spiritual Life Survey, Anna Sun, Purdue University’s Center on Religion and Chinese Society.

The same survey has found that 2.2% (≈30 million) of the total population declares to be affiliated to one or another of the many [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]]. At the same time, reports of the Chinese government claim that the sects have about the same number of followers of the five state-sanctioned religions counted together (~13% ≈180 million).&lt;ref name="Phoenix Weekly"&gt;大陆民间宗教管理变局 ''Management change in the situation of mainland folk religion''.

====Economy of temples and rituals====
[[File:Temple on the rooftop of a commercial building in Lucheng, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.jpg|thumb|Folk temple on the rooftop of a commercial building in the city of Wenzhou.]]
Scholars have studied the [[economy|economic]] dimension of Chinese folk religion,&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Lang, Selina Ching Chan, Lars Ragvald. ''[http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln270/Folk%20Temples.pdf Folk Temples and the Chinese Religious Economy]''. On ''Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion'', 2005, Volume 1, Article 4.&lt;/ref&gt; whose rituals and temples interweave a form of [[grassroots]] socio-economic capital for the well-being of local communities, fostering the circulation of wealth and its investment in the "sacred capital" of temples, gods and ancestors.{{sfnb|Yang|2007|p=226}}

This religious economy already played a role in periods of imperial China, plays a significant role in modern [[Taiwan]], and is seen as a driving force in the rapid economic development in parts of rural [[China]], especially the southern and eastern coasts.{{sfnb|Yang|2007|pp=226-230}}

According to Law (2005), in his study about the relationship between the revival of folk religion and the recostruction of patriarchal civilisation:
::"Similar to the case in Taiwan, the practice of folk religion in rural southern China, particularly in the Pearl River Delta, has thrived as the economy has developed. ... In contrast to [[Max Weber|Weberian]] predictions, these phenomena suggest that drastic economic development in the Pearl River Delta may not lead to total disenchantment with beliefs concerning magic in the cosmos. On the contrary, the revival of folk religions in the Delta region is serving as a countervailing re-embedding force from the local cultural context, leading to the coexistence of the world of enchantments and the modern world."{{sfnb|Law|2005|p=90}}

Yang Mayfair (2007) defines it as an "embedded capitalism", which preserves local identity and autonomy, and an "ethical capitalism" in which the drive for individual accumulation of money is tempered by religious and kinship ethics of generosity which foster the sharing and investment of wealth in the construction of civil society.{{sfnb|Yang|2007|p=223}}

===Overseas Chinese===
[[File:Yokohama Masobyo 2013-05-05.JPG|thumb|[[Temple of Mazu, Yokohama|Temple of Mazu]] in [[Yokohama]], serving the [[Chinese people in Japan|Chinese of Japan]].]]
{{Main|Shenism in Southeast Asia}}
Most of the [[overseas Chinese]] populations have maintained Chinese folk religions, often adapting to the new environment by developing new cults and incorporating elements of local traditions. In [[Southeast Asia]], Chinese deities are subject to a "re-territorialisation" and maintain their relation to the ethnic associations (i.e. the Hainanese Association or the Fujianese Association, each of them has a patron deity and manages one or more temples of such a deity).&lt;ref name="Tan"&gt;Tan, Chee-Beng. ''Tianhou and the Chinese in Diaspora''. Chapter in the ''Routledge Handbook of the Chinese Diaspora''. Routledge, 2013. {{ISBN|1136230963}}. pp. 417-422&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important deity among Southeast Asian Chinese is [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]], the Queen of Heaven and goddess of the sea. This is related to the fact that most of these Chinese populations are from southeastern provinces of China, where the goddess is very popular.&lt;ref name="Tan"/&gt; Some [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]] have spread successfully among Southeast Asian Chinese. They include especially [[De religion|Church of Virtue]] (Deism),&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Formoso. ''De Jiao - A Religious Movement in Contemporary China and Overseas: Purple Qi from the East''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5095">'''Drawing down the Moon''' (also known as drawing down the Goddess) is a central [[Ritual#Religious rituals|ritual]] in many contemporary [[Wicca]]n traditions. During the ritual, a [[coven]]'s [[Priest|High Priestess]] enters a [[trance]] and requests that the [[Goddess]] or [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], symbolized by the [[Moon]], [[Spiritual possession|enter her body]] and speak through her. The High Priestess may be aided by the [[Wicca|High Priest]], who invokes the spirit of the Goddess. During her trance, the Goddess speaks through the High Priestess.

==History==

The name most likely comes from a depiction of two [[women]] and the moon on an [[Art in Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[vase]], believed to date from the second century BCE.{{ref|1}}

In classical times, ancient [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] witches&lt;ref&gt;Rhododaphne, or, The Thessalian spell: a poem By Thomas Love Peacock&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Sourcebook By Daniel Ogden Page 238 {{ISBN|0-19-515123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; were believed to control the moon, according to the [[Tract (literature)|tract]]: "If I command the moon, it will come down; and if I wish to withhold the day, night will linger over my head; and again, if I wish to embark on the sea, I need no ship, and if I wish to fly through the air, I am free from my weight."{{ref|2}}

The drawing down of the moon derives from the [[Vangelo]]. In this a poem defining the drawing down of the moon is written and this has been used as the basis for the drawing down of the moon by various Wiccan groups. The practice forms part of both Gardnerian and Cochranian rites. The practice is also reference in Reginald Scot's "The Discoverie of Witchcraft".

Though a number of Wiccan traditions may practice a variation of the ritual, the modern form likely originated in [[Gardnerian Wicca]], and is considered a central element of Gardnerian and [[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrian]] Wiccan ceremonies. During the modern rite, the High Priestess may recite the [[Charge of the Goddess]], a text based in a mixture of writings by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and [[Aleister Crowley]], though now often used in its rescension by [[Doreen Valiente]], High Priestess in the Gardnerian tradition.

[[Mel D. Faber]] explains the ritual in psychoanalytical terms of attempting to re-unite with the protective-[[mother]] archetype.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Mel D. (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1FZ2hMl56IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Modern Witchcraft and Psychoanalysis''.] Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. p.96. {{ISBN|0-8386-3488-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-3488-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern traditions, some solitary Wiccans also perform the ritual, usually within a circle and performed under the light of a [[full Moon]]. The solitary will stand in the Goddess Pose (both arms held high, palms up, body and arms forming a 'Y') and recite a charge, or chant.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==The ritual in print==

"Drawing Down the Moon" is also the title of a book by [[National Public Radio]] reporter, [[Margot Adler]]— ''[[Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]''—originally published in 1979. Adler writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...in this ritual, one of the most serious and beautiful in the modern Craft, the priest invokes into the priestess (or, depending on your point of view, she evokes from within herself) the Goddess or Triple Goddess, symbolized by the phases of the moon. She is known by a thousand names, and among them were those I had used as a child. In some Craft rituals the priestess goes into a trance and speaks; in other traditions the ritual is a more formal dramatic dialogue, often of intense beauty, in which, again, the priestess speaks, taking the role of the Goddess. In both instances, the priestess functions as the Goddess incarnate, within the circle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Forbidden relationships in Judaism''' ({{lang|he|איסורי ביאה}} ''{{lang|he-Latn|Isurey bi'ah}}'') are those intimate relationships which are forbidden by prohibitions in the [[Torah]] and also by [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinical]] injunctions. Some of these prohibitions—those listed in [[Leviticus 18]], known as ''{{transl|he|arayot}}'' ({{lang-he|עריות}})—are considered such a serious transgression of Jewish law that one must give up one's life rather than transgress one of them.&lt;ref name = "mitzvot324"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisenberg|2005|p=324.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This does not necessarily apply to a rape victim.&lt;ref&gt;Rama and other commentaries on Shulchan Aruch II:157:1&lt;/ref&gt;) This is as opposed to most other [[aveira|prohibitions]], in which one is [[Pikuach nefesh|generally required to transgress the commandment when a life is on the line]].

== Adultery ==
{{Main article|Thou shalt not commit adultery#In Judaism}}
[[Adultery]] is prohibited by the seventh of the [[Ten Commandments]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|20:12|HE}}) which says simply:
:Thou shalt not commit adultery.

It is forbidden for a man to have sexual relations with a married woman not his wife. ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:20|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:10|HE}})

== Niddah ==
A man is not allowed to have sexual relations with a woman - including his wife - during and after her [[niddah|menstrual period]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:19|HE}}), until after she undergoes the proper cleansing procedures in a [[mikveh]]. Such a woman is referred to as [[niddah]].

== Religious intermarriage ==
{{Main|Interfaith marriage in Judaism}}
Religious intermarriage is forbidden in Judaism. There are differing opinions among the rabbis as to when the prohibition on sexual relations with non-Jews is from the Torah, and when it is rabbinic.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, III:16:1-2 and commentaries&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incestuous relations ==
{{Main|Jewish views on incest|Incest in the Bible}}
Sexual relation with certain close relations are forbidden. Though they are generally called [[Jewish views of incest|incestuous relations]], the biblical list does not necessarily correspond to those prohibited under state laws. The prohibited relations are:

* One's [[mother]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:7|HE}})
* One's [[father]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:7|HE}})
* One's [[stepmother]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:8|HE}})
* One's paternal or maternal [[sister]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:9|HE}})
* One's paternal sister through one's father's wife ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:11|HE}})
* One's [[daughter]] (inferred from {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:10|HE}})
* One's [[granddaughter]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:10|HE}})
* [[stepdaughter|A woman and her daughter]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:17|HE}})
* A woman and her [[granddaughter]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:17|HE}})
* One's [[aunt]] by blood ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:12-13|HE}})
* One's [[uncle|father's brother]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:14|HE}})
* One's [[aunt|father's brother's wife]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:14|HE}})
* One's [[daughter-in-law]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:15|HE}})
* One's [[sister-in-law|brother's wife]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:16|HE}}), with the exception of [[Yibum]]
* One's [[sister-in-law|wife's sister]] during one's wife's lifetime, even if since divorced ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:18|HE}})

=== Rabbinically prohibited relationships ===

In addition to the relationships biblically prohibited to Jews, rabbis have gone further to prohibit certain additional relationships with various blood relatives and in-laws. These are called "Shni'ot" (secondary prohibitions). Some of these are:&lt;ref name="mitzvot324"/&gt;
* One's [[grandmother]]
* One's [[brother]]
* One's [[great-grandmother]]
* One's grandfather's wife
* One's [[great-grandfather]]'s wife
* One's grandson's wife

Adopted children who are raised together are not permitted to marry because of appearances, even if they are not biologically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/The%20Yichud%20Prohibition%20-%20Part%201.htm |title=The Yichud Prohibition- Part One: To Whom Does It Apply? |publisher=Koltorah.org |date=2002-11-16 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exclusions from the assembly ==

The Bible excludes certain categories of people from taking part in the ''[[qahal]] (assembly) of [[HaShem|Hashem]]''. Jewish tradition considers this to be solely a limitation on marriage.

=== Biblical peoples ===

A Jew is prohibited from marrying a male [[Moab]]ite and [[Ammon]]ite convert ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:4|HE}}); or an Egyptian or [[Edomite]] convert up to the third generation from conversion ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:8-9|HE}}).

[[Nethinim]] / [[Gibeonites]] are prohibited by rabbinic injunction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yevamot]] 8:2&lt;/ref&gt;

As the people currently living in those areas may not be descended from the original peoples, these prohibitions may not apply today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yadayim]] 4:4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]], [[Shulchan Aruch]], III:4:10 and commentaries, Habahir edition, Leshem publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mamzer ===
{{Main|Mamzer}}

A [[mamzer]] in Jewish law is a child resulting from an incestuous liaison or an adulterous liaison by a married woman.&lt;ref name="JELaws" /&gt; (This is not necessarily the same definition as a [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]] by other societies, as it does not include a child of an unmarried woman.)&lt;ref name="JELaws" /&gt; As a mamzer is excluded from the assembly, ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:3|HE}}) the Talmud forbids a marriage by an ordinary Jew to a mamzer.&lt;ref&gt;Yebamot, 4:13&lt;/ref&gt; However, a mamzer may marry a convert or another mamzer, though their child would also be considered a mamzer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonidies]], [[Mishneh Torah]], Sanctity, Laws of Sexual Prohibitions, 15:7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Certain eunuchs ===

Jewish tradition also forbids marriage to a man who has been forcibly emasculated; the [[koine Greek|Greek]] term ''[[eunuch|spadon]]'' ({{lang|grc|σπάδων}}; Latin: ''[[wikt:spado#Latin|spado]]'') which is used to refer to such people, is used in the [[Septuagint]] to denote certain foreign political officials (resembling the meaning of ''[[eunuch]]'').&lt;ref name="JELaws" /&gt; The Jewish prohibition does not include men who were born without visible testicles (conditions including [[cryptorchidism]]), or without a visible penis (conditions including [[hermaphroditism]]).&lt;ref name="JELaws" /&gt; There is dispute, even in traditional Judaism, about whether this prohibited group of men should include those who have become, at some point since their birth, emasculated as the result of a disease.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob ben Asher]], [[Even Ha'ezer|Eben ha-'Ezer]], 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special rules for priests ==
[[kohen|Israelite priests (kohanim)]] are not allowed to marry:

* divorcees&lt;ref name="JELaws" /&gt;
* [[Conversion to Judaism|converts]]
* a woman who has had certain forbidden sexual relationships; such a woman is called a [[zonah]] in the Torah) (Lev. 21:7)
* a woman who was born of the prohibited relations of a [[kohen]] (called a [[chalalah]]) (Lev. 21:7)
* [[The Bible and slavery|women captured during warfare]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ketubot (Talmud)|Ketubot]] 22a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ketubot 27a&lt;/ref&gt;
* a widow whose brother-in-law refused to perform a [[levirate marriage]], and she consequently performs the [[Halitzah]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Yebamot 24a&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these prohibitions are biblical, and some are rabbinical.

The [[Kohen Gadol]] (high priest) must also not marry a [[widow]] (Lev. 21:14). Sexual relations with a widow are also forbidden (Lev. 21:14). He is required to marry a virgin maiden (Lev. 21:13). However, if he was married to a woman otherwise permitted to a kohen, and was then elevated to the high priesthood, he may remain married to her.

== Homosexuality and bisexuality==
{{Main|Judaism and sexual orientation}}

=== Orthodox view ===

[[Orthodox Judaism]] interprets ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|HE}}) as forbidding men from lying with other men in the manner in which they would with a woman, and calls it an [[abomination (Bible)|abomination]]. ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:14|HE}} specifically prohibits such relationships with one's father or uncle.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisenberg|2005|p=327.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three reasons rabbis give for men lying with other men being prohibited in Jewish law:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisenberg|2005|p=325}}. Lamm, 1991 has a similar list.&lt;/ref&gt;
# It is a defiance of gender anatomy, which is unlike God's intention of procreation and sexual activity.
# The [[sexual arousal]] involved results in a vain emission of [[semen]].
# It may lead a man to abandon his family.

There is no prohibition in the Torah against sexual intercourse between two women, but rabbinic law has prohibited it as an extension of the "[[Homosexuality in ancient Egypt|activities of (ancient) Egypt]]" (see {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:3|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Joseph Karo, Shulchan Aruch, III:20:2&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not considered [[adultery]], and does not prohibit the woman to a kohen.&lt;ref&gt;Beit Sh'muel, Shulchan Aruch, III:20:2 based on [[Maimonidies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservative view ===

[[Conservative Judaism]]'s [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] has validated different approaches to homosexuality and bisexuality, with one opinion being like the Orthodox position in many respects, and another opinion permitting many forms of homosexual sex and relationships, while continuing to regard anal intercourse between men as prohibited.

In 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism devised a commitment ceremony for same-sex couples, though not defined as kiddushin. In 2016, the rabbis of the American branch of Conservative Judaism passed a resolution supporting transgender rights.

=== Humanistic Judaism ===
In 2004, the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] issued a resolution supporting "the legal recognition of marriage and divorce between adults of the same sex", and affirming "the value of marriage between any two committed adults with the sense of obligations, responsibilities, and consequences thereof".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/MarriageEquality.htm |accessdate=19 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010054121/http://www.shj.org/MarriageEquality.htm |archivedate=10 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reform view ===

[[Reform Judaism]] interprets Leviticus 18:22 as forbidding men from using sex as a form of ownership over men. Reform Jewish authors have revisited the Leviticus text, and ask why the text mentions that one should not lie with a man "as with a woman". If it is to be assumed that the Torah does not waste words, the authors ask why the Torah includes this extra clause. Most Reform Jews suggest that since intercourse involved possession (one of the ways in which a man "acquired" a wife was to have intercourse with her), similar to the Christian theology of using sex to "consummate" a marriage, it was abhorrent that a man might acquire another man - it is not the act of homosexual intercourse itself which is abhorrent, but using this act to acquire another man and therefore confuse the gender boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/a-to-z-of-reform-judaism/contemporary-issues/homosexuality.html |title=homosexuality &amp;#124; contemporary-issues &amp;#124; a-to-z-of-reform-judaism- The Movement for Reform Judaism |publisher=Reformjudaism.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bestiality ==

Men and women are forbidden from engaging in [[bestiality]]. ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:23|HE}}) It is considered an [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]] according to the Torah.&lt;ref name="mitzvot324"/&gt;

== Youth ==

Rather than being seen as merely a literary device to quickly describe the populating of the earth, the biblical instruction to ''go forth and multiply''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|1:28|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; was interpreted by the [[classical era|classical]] [[rabbi]]s to mean that it was the duty of every male Jew to marry as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="Maimonides212"&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''Minyan haMitzvot'', 212&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Talmud]]ic rabbis urged that children should be married as soon as they had reached the average age of [[puberty]], which was deemed to occur at 14 years of age;&lt;ref name="San76b"&gt;''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' 76b&lt;/ref&gt; {{Failed verification|date=June 2016}} however, it was also strictly forbidden, by [[classical rabbinical literature]], for parents to allow their children to marry before the children had reached this age.&lt;ref name="San76b" /&gt; {{Failed verification|date=June 2016}} Despite the young threshold for marriage, marriages with a large age gap between the spouses (e. g., between a young man and an old woman) were thoroughly opposed by the classical rabbis&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yebamot]]'' 44a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sanhedrin'' 76a&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical rabbis saw 18 as the ideal age to become married,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pirkei Abot]]'' 5:24&lt;/ref&gt; and anyone unmarried after the age of twenty was said to have been cursed by God;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nashim|Kiddushin]]'' 29b&lt;/ref&gt; [[beth din|rabbinical courts]] frequently tried to compel an individual to marry, if they had passed the age of twenty without marriage.&lt;ref name="JELaws"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Marriage Laws''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the classical rabbis viewed study of the [[Torah]] as a valid reason for remaining unmarried, although they were only rarely willing to regard life-long celibacy favourably.&lt;ref&gt;''Yebamot'' 63b&lt;/ref&gt; Since the classical rabbis viewed marriage as a duty deriving from the instruction to ''go forth and multiply'',&lt;ref name="Maimonides212" /&gt; they also believed that the duty to marry ended once the husband had fathered both a son and a daughter;&lt;ref name="Yeb61a"&gt;''Yebamot'' 61a&lt;/ref&gt; despite this, they also argued that no man should live without a wife even after he has several children.&lt;ref name="Yeb61a" /&gt;

=== Ability to give consent ===

Children, however, were not regarded as old enough to make an informed decision, and so could not consent to marriage themselves,&lt;ref name="JELaws" /&gt; although marriage to a female child was still permissible if her father consented, whether she agreed to it or not;&lt;ref name="JELaws" /&gt; if the father was dead, such consent could be given by her mother, or her brothers, but in this latter case, the girl could annul the marriage when she reached the "''standard''" age of puberty (12), if she wished.&lt;ref name="JELaws" /&gt;

The [[mentally handicapped]], and [[deaf-mute]]s, were also regarded, by traditional Jewish law, as being unable to give their consent; indeed, marriage to such people was forbidden. However, the rabbis allowed deaf-mutes to marry each other.&lt;ref name="JELaws" /&gt;

'''Gagan mein thaal''' is an [[Aarti]] (prayer) in [[Sikh]] religion which was recited by first guru, [[Guru Nanak]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livehindustan.com/news/tayaarinews/tayaarinews/article1-story-67-67-199585.html गुरु नानक देव और उनके द्वारा प्रवर्तित मार्ग&lt;/ref&gt; This was recited by him in 1506&lt;ref name="orgov"&gt;http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/orissareview/2012/Feb-March/engpdf/1-6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or 1508&lt;ref name="barusahib"&gt;http://www.barusahib.org/Assets/Publications/Natures_Own_Arti.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sikh-heritage"&gt;http://www.sikh-heritage.co.uk/Scriptures/Guru%20Granth/Guru%20Granth.htm&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; at the revered [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]] during his journey (called "udaasi") to east India.&lt;ref name="orgov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barusahib"/&gt; This arti is sung (not performed with platter &amp; lamps etc.) daily after recitation of [[Rehraas Sahib]] &amp; [[Ardās]] at the [[Harmandir Sahib]], [[Amritsar]].
 
== Views of Ravindranath Tagore ==
Famous saint poet of India [[Rabindranath Tagore]] was once asked by [[Balraj Sahni]], who used to teach at [[Santiniketan]] then, that the way he has written the [[Jana Gana Mana|National Anthem of India]], why doesn't he write one for the world? He replied that it has already been written. It was written in 16th Century by Guru Nanak,and this was sung by Guru Nanak as Arati at Jagannath puri to the lord(the omnipresent God).
 and that this anthem was not only for the world, but for the entire  universe. He was so influenced by this aarti that he himself translated it into Bangla language.&lt;ref name="orgov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barusahib"/&gt;

== Text and translation ==

Guru Nanak Dev has imagined the entire universe decorated as a prayer platter on the altar of the almighty. The starting verses of the aarti are as follows :

Gagan mein thaal, rav chand deepak bane,
taarka mandal janak moti
dhoop malay aan lao, pawan chavro kare
sagal ban raai phulant jyoti
kaisi aarti hoye, bhavkhandana teri aarti.

anhat sabad bajant bheri
kaisi aarti hoye, bhavkhandana teri aarti.

Means - The sky is the prayer-platter, the sun and the moon are the lamps, the stars and the constellations are the pearls and jewels. The air coming from the sandal laden Malay mountain are the incense, air is the fan, entire flora of the earth are the flowers..... oh... what an aarti it is ! o destroyer of fear !

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26873">[[File:Day of Hajj. Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mount Arafat|Plains of Arafat]] on the day of [[Hajj]], {{circa}} 2003.]]
There have been incidents during the [[Hajj]]', the [[Muslim]] pilgrimage to the city of [[Mecca]], that have caused loss of life. Every follower of [[Islam]] is required to visit Mecca during the Hajj at least once in his or her lifetime, if able to do so; the pilgrimage is one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. During the month of the Hajj, Mecca must cope with as many as three million pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16442316/|title=Pilgrims mark end of peaceful hajj: Circling of Kaaba brings to close perhaps largest-ever pilgrimage to Mecca]|work=BBC News|date=January 2, 2007|quote=This year’s hajj was likely the biggest ever, with authorities estimating that around 3 million people participated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commercial aviation|Plane travel]] makes Mecca and the Hajj more accessible to [[pilgrim]]s from all over the world. As a consequence, the Hajj has become increasingly crowded. City officials are required to control large crowds and provide food, shelter, sanitation, and emergency services for millions. However, it has not always been possible to prevent incidents.

==Crushes and failures of crowd control==
{{wikinews|Hundreds dead in Hajj stampede}}
[[File:Amellie - Stoning of the devil 2006 Hajj.jpg|thumb|[[Stoning of the devil]], 2006]]
Sometimes the dense, surging troupes, trekking from one station of the pilgrimage to the next, cause a [[stampede]], or more precisely, a progressive troupe collapse. At densities above 6 or 7 persons per square meter, individuals cannot move, groups are swept along in waves, individuals jostle to find breath and to avoid falling and being trampled, and hundreds of deaths can occur as a result. The [[stoning of the devil]] (''ramī aj-jamarāt'') ceremony is particularly crowded and dangerous. Pilgrims ritualistically throw pebbles at three walls (formerly pillars) which represent the three places where the Quran describes how the devil tempted Abraham. It is one of a series of ritual acts that must be performed in the Hajj.

Some notable incidents include:

This caused pilgrims to trip, rapidly resulting in a lethal stampede. An estimated two million people were performing the ritual at the time.

==Disease==
Mingling of visitors from many countries, some of which have poor health care systems still plagued by preventable infectious diseases, can lead to the spread of [[epidemic]]s. If an outbreak were to occur on the road to Mecca, pilgrims could exacerbate the problem when they returned home and passed their infection on to others. This was more of a problem in the past. One such disease, which has prompted response from the Saudi government, is [[meningitis]] as it became a primary concern after an international outbreak following the Hajj in 1987. Due to post-Hajj outbreaks globally of certain types of meningitis in previous years, it is now a [[visa (document)|visa]] requirement to be immunised with the [[Neisseria meningitidis|ACW135Y]] [[vaccine]] before arrival. Every year, the Saudi government publishes a list of required vaccines for pilgrims, which for 2010 also included [[yellow fever]], [[polio]], and [[influenza vaccine|influenza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2010/wer8543/en/index.html|title=WHO – 22 October 2010, vol. 85, 43 (pp 425–436)|publisher=Who.int|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barasheed|first1=Osamah|last2=Rashid|first2=Harunor|last3=Heron|first3=Leon|last4=Ridda|first4=Iman|last5=Haworth|first5=Elizabeth|last6=Nguyen-Van-Tam|first6=Jonathan|last7=Dwyer|first7=Dominic E.|last8=Booy|first8=Robert|title=Influenza Vaccination Among Australian Hajj Pilgrims: Uptake, Attitudes, and Barriers|journal=Journal of Travel Medicine|date=November 2014|volume=21|issue=6|pages=384–390|doi=10.1111/jtm.12146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus===
{{As of|2013|9|9}}, the Saudi government asked "elderly and chronically ill Muslims to avoid the hajj this year" and restricted the numbers of people allowed into the country due to [[Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus]] (MERS-CoV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/qatar-announces-second-mers-virus-death-150003242.html | title=MERS virus claims three more lives in Saudi Arabia | publisher=AFP | date=September 7, 2013 &lt;!-- 8:42 PM --&gt;|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spain reports its first MERS case; woman travelled to Saudi Arabia for Hajj"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Spain+reports+first+MERS+case+woman+travelled+Saudi+Arabia+Hajj/9133754/story.html|title=Spain reports its first MERS case; woman travelled to Saudi Arabia for Hajj|publisher=Vancouver Sun|date=7 November 2013|accessdate=12 November 2013|author=Branswell, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although MERS-CoV was not detected among pilgrims, this does not rule out risk of the disease at Hajj.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barasheed|first1=Osamah|last2=Rashid|first2=Harunor|last3=Alfelali|first3=Mohammad|last4=Tashani|first4=Mohamed|last5=Azeem|first5=Mohammad|last6=Bokhary|first6=Hamid|last7=Kalantan|first7=Nadeen|last8=Samkari|first8=Jamil|last9=Heron|first9=Leon|last10=Kok|first10=Jen|last11=Taylor|first11=Janette|last12=El Bashir|first12=Haitham|last13=Memish|first13=Ziad A.|last14=Haworth|first14=Elizabeth|last15=Holmes|first15=Edward C.|last16=Dwyer|first16=Dominic E.|last17=Asghar|first17=Atif|last18=Booy|first18=Robert|title=Viral respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims in 2013|journal=Virologica Sinica|date=14 November 2014|volume=29|issue=6|pages=364–371|doi=10.1007/s12250-014-3507-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease, though, is only mildly contagious.

===Historical outbreaks===

A concrete multi-story building located in Mecca close to the Grand Mosque collapsed on January 5, 2006. The building, the Al-Ghaza Hotel, is said to have housed a restaurant, a convenience store, and a hotel. The hotel was reported to have been housing pilgrims to the 2006 Hajj. It is not clear how many pilgrims were in the hotel at the time of the collapse. As of the latest reports, the death toll was 76 and the number of injured was 64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/ap/2006/01/06/ap2433373.html |title=Mecca Death Toll Rises to 76 – Forbes.com, 6 January 2006 |publisher=WEb.archive.org |accessdate=11 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110222840/http://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/ap/2006/01/06/ap2433373.html |archivedate=January 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crane fell in the grand mosque on September 11, 2015, ten days before Hajj, causing 118 deaths and 394 injuries.

==Other fatal events ==
Of the millions of pilgrims each year, many are elderly, and some die of their illnesses, exacerbated in some cases by the heat and exertion.
*Before the beginning of the first day of the December 2006 Hajj, 243 pilgrims had died, according to a statement by the Saudi government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?from=rss_World&amp;set_id=1&amp;click_id=3&amp;art_id=vn20061228102521827C202045|title=Millions descend on Mecca for haj|publisher=Iol.co.za|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of deaths were reportedly related to heart problems, exhaustion in the elderly and people with weak health, caused by the heat and tiring physical work involved in the pilgrimage. After the conclusion of the Hajj, the [[Nigeria]]n government reported that 33 nationals had died mostly "as a result of hypertension, diabetes and heart attack", not due to epidemic illnesses, and rejected assertions that Nigerian pilgrims died in an accident on a road to [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200701080951.html|title=Nigeria: Hypertension, Diabetes Kill 33 Nigerian Pilgrims in Saudi Arabia|publisher=Allafrica.com|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]]'s official news agency has reported that by December 30 (10 Dhu al-Hijjah), 22 Egyptian pilgrims had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200612/31/eng20061231_337299.html|title=People's Daily Online–22 Egyptian pilgrims dies during Mecca hajj|publisher=English.people.com.cn|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four elderly Filipino pilgrims in their 50s died during the pilgrimage of illnesses or other 'natural causes', and were buried in Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metroregions/view_article.php?article_id=41844|title=Inquirer.net|publisher=Newsinfo.inq|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pakistan]]i Hajj Medical Commission has announced that approximately 130 Pakistani pilgrims died during the Hajj season in Saudi Arabia, "mostly aged and victims of pneumonia and heart patients", and that 66 pilgrims were admitted to Saudi hospitals for similar ailments.

==Pickpocketing==
Of late, [[pickpocketing]] has created numerous problems for Hajj pilgrims. According to the Save Madina Foundation, 321 were victims of pickpocketing during Hajj in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savemadinafoundation.webstarts.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321222542/http://www.savemadinafoundation.webstarts.com/|date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official responses==
[[File:2.5m Hajj pilgrims visited jamarat yesterday, according to Saudi public security monitors - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|right|The Saudi government has created a [[CCTV]] network to oversee security during the event.]]
Critics say that the Saudi government should have done more to prevent such tragedies. The Saudi government insists that any such mass gatherings are inherently dangerous and difficult to handle, and that they have taken a number of steps to prevent the problems. The fatalities in the largest tragedy in September 2015 are alleged to have been downplayed by the Saudis by as many as 1,700.&lt;ref name= ap_crush /&gt;

One of the biggest steps, which is also controversial, is a new system of registrations, passports, and travel visas to control the flow of pilgrims. This system is designed to encourage and accommodate first-time visitors to Mecca, while restricting repeat visits. Pilgrims who have the means and desire to perform the Hajj several times have protested what they see as discrimination, but the Hajj Commission has stated that they see no alternative if further tragedies are to be prevented.

Following the 2004 stampede, Saudi authorities embarked on major construction work in and around the Jamaraat Bridge area. Additional accessways, footbridges, and emergency exits were built, and the three cylindrical pillars were replaced with concrete walls to enable more pilgrims simultaneous access to them without the jostling and fighting for position of recent years. The government has also announced a multimillion-dollar project to expand the bridge to five levels; the project is planned for completion in time for the [[Islamic calendar|1427 AH]] (Dec. 2006 – Jan. 2007) Hajj.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4600310.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hajj ritual sees new safety moves | date=January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the 2006 incident, the Jamaraat Bridge and the pillars representing [[Devil (Islam)|Satan]] were demolished and reconstructed.  A wider, multi-level bridge was built, and massive columns replaced the pillars themselves.  Now, each level of the bridge allows easier and safer access to the columns representing Satan. In addition, the stoning ceremony must be carried out according to pre-determined schedules to prevent over-crowding and the attendant risks. The Jamaraat basin has been expanded from its current circular shape into an oval to allow better access to the pillars. The new arrangements provide for separate access and departure routes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hajinformation.com/main/k40.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104133445/http://www.hajinformation.com/main/k40.htm|date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official data, the [[Muslim]] population of [[Suriname]] represens about 13.9 percent of the country's total population as of 2012, which is the highest percentages of Muslims on the [[Americas|South American continent]]. Though the majority belong to the [[Sunni]] interpretation of Islam and some syncretic sects such as [[Sufism]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Kejawèn]].
 
Some speculate that Muslims first came to Suriname as slaves from [[West Africa]] and then were converted to [[Christianity]] over time, even though there is little proof for these speculations. The ancestors of the actual Muslim population came to the country as indentured laborers from [[South Asia]] and [[Indonesia]], from whom today most Muslims in Suriname are descended.

Because [[Islam]] came to Suriname with immigrants from Indonesia (Java) and the [[South Asia]] (today [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]]), who brought their local form of Islam to Suriname, it is strongly influenced by these regions. Apart from descent, most Surinamese Muslims also share the same culture and speak the [[Suriname#Languages|same languages]]. Suriname has a small number of [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] Muslims and their native-born children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyana.org/features/afghanguyanese_muslim.html The Afghan muslims of Guyana and Suriname]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3261">'''Jatukham Rammathep''' is the name of an unusually popular [[Thai amulets|amulet]] sold by some [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Buddhist temple|temples]] in [[Thailand]]. The amulet is named for two princes of the [[Srivijaya]] kingdom of southern Thailand, and is believed to provide protection and good fortune to the bearer.  Some legends hold that the name actually belongs to an incarnation of the Bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara]], whose worship was known in the south due to the presence of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism there during earlier eras.&lt;ref name="wijr"&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/17/national/national_30032023.php Who is Jatukham Rammathep?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Jatukam Rammathep amulets were created in 1987 by a retired Thai police general who believed that the spirit of Jatukham Rammathep had assisted him in solving a difficult murder case.

During 2006, Jatukam Rammathep amulets began to grow wildly in popularity among Thais who believed in their ability to grant good fortune and solve personal problems.  The amulets were initially distributed by a temple in the town of [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]] in southern Thailand.  As the demand for these amulets grew, they began to also be produced at other temples in Thailand.&lt;ref name="bca"&gt;[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=52,4317,0,0,1,0 "Revered Thai monk flogs sarcastic fortune cookies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, a woman died after being trampled in a rush to acquire reservations for a batch of Jatukam Rammathep amulets being produced at the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat#Wat Phra Mahathat Woromaha Vihan|Mahathat Woromaha Vihan]] temple in Nakhon Si Thammarat.&lt;ref name="bca"/&gt; Later that month, in the face of a crime wave of daily amulet robberies, Thailand's [[Supreme Patriarch]] stopped providing materials from the temple, such as ash from incense, used to make the amulets.&lt;ref&gt;2007-04-23. [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/23/national/national_30032451.php "Patriarch ends role in amulets."] ''The Nation'', Bangkok, Thailand, via nationmultimedia.com. Retrieved on 2007-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trucks with loudspeakers blare promotions for different series of amulets all day in Nakhon Si Thammarat, and colorful posters cover many walls.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Jonathan. 2007-09-03. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6976705.stm "Thailand's frenzy for amulets."] BBC News, via news.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 2007-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that sales of the Jatukham Rammathep amulet in Thailand will amount to over 20 billion [[baht]] during 2007.&lt;ref name="bca"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">'''Johann Heinrich Arnold''', also called Heini, (23 December 1913 - 23 July 1982) was the Elder, that is leader, of the [[Bruderhof Communities]] from 1962 until his death in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heiniarnold.com/|title=Heini Arnold - Bruderhof Pastor, Counselor and Author|website=www.heiniarnold.com|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Johann Heinrich Arnold was born 23 December 1913 in [[Ritten|Oberbozen]]  as second son of Bruderhof founder [[Eberhard Arnold]] and his wife Emmy.&lt;ref&gt;Emmy Arnold: ''Gegen den Strom'', Moers 1983, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the age of five he lived with his family in the Christian community his parents had founded in 1920 including Sannerz and the Rhönbruderhof in Germany, then England and Primavera, Paraguay. In the 1930s he lived as a university student for some time in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1936 he married Annemarie, née Wachter, and had nine children with her. In 1955 he immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Arnold,_Johann_Heinrich_(%22Heini%22)_(1913-1982) Arnold, Johann Heinrich ("Heini") (1913-1982)] at [[Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Mow: Torches rekindled: the Bruderhof's struggle for renewal, Ulster Park, NY: Plough Publishing House, 1989, pages 108-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was ordained as Servant of the Word (Diener des Wortes) in 1939, at the Cotswold Bruderhof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Arnold,_Johann_Heinrich_(%22Heini%22)_(1913-1982) Arnold, Johann Heinrich ("Heini") (1913-1982)] at [[Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 he became very ill and almost died. He was therefore removed from his office. In 1944 he was even sent away from the community for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Mow: Torches rekindled: the Bruderhof's struggle for renewal, Ulster Park, NY: Plough Publishing House, 1989, pages 118-122.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reinstated as Servant of the Word in 1951. In the "great crisis" of the Bruderhof during the years 1959 to 1961 he was the driving force to end socialist ideas at the Bruderhof and to return to the Christian ideas of his father. In 1962 he became the overall leader of the Bruderhof Communities. He served as leader of the Bruderhof until his death in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Arnold,_Johann_Heinrich_(%22Heini%22)_(1913-1982) Arnold, Johann Heinrich ("Heini") (1913-1982)] at [[Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this mindset, crossing the seas to foreign lands causes the loss of one's social respectability, as well as the putrefaction of one’s cultural character and posterity.&lt;ref name="Daniel2012"&gt;{{cite book | author=Daniel Bass | title=Everyday Ethnicity in Sri Lanka: Up-country Tamil Identity Politics | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivFuK_asOzcC&amp;pg=PA27 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | date=27 November 2012 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-52624-1 | pages=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The offense of crossing the sea is also known as "Samudrolanghana" or "Sagarollanghana". The [[Baudhayana#The Dharmas.C5.ABtra|Dharma Sutra of Baudhayana]] (II.1.2.2) lists sea voyages as first of the offences that cause the loss of varna.&lt;ref name="Charles1998"&gt;{{cite book | author=Charles Eliot | title=Hinduism and Buddhism: An Historical Sketch | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfC1006rObsC&amp;pg=PA102 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | year=1998 | publisher=Curzon | isbn=978-0-7007-0679-2 | page=102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharma Sutra suggests a person can wipe away this offense in three years by eating little at every fourth meal time; bathing at dawn, noon and dusk; standing during the day; and seated during the night.&lt;ref name="Patrick1999"&gt;{{cite book | author=Patrick Olivelle | title=The Dharmasutras : The Law Codes of Ancient India: The Law Codes of Ancient India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIu70fYvxKIC&amp;pg=PA168 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | date=2 September 1999 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-283882-7 | page=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons behind the proscription include the inability to carry out the daily rituals of traditional Hindu life and the sin of contact with the characterless, uncivilized [[mleccha]] creatures of the foreign lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3065 Crossing the Ocean] by Vrindavanam S. Gopalakrishnan. [[Hinduism Today]], July/August/September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An associated notion was that crossing the ocean entailed the end of the [[Reincarnation and Hinduism|reincarnation cycle]], as the traveler was cut off from the regenerating waters of the [[Ganges]]. Such voyages also meant breaking family and social ties. In another respect, the inhabitants of the land beyond the "black water" were ''hougli''s, bad-spirited and monstrous swines, as well. The [[mleccha]] people were thought to have been spawned by immoral reprobates and blasphemously held religious belief in ''[[Āstika and nāstika|nāstika]]'', albeit in different forms. They were thought to have rejected the [[Vedas]] and have ceased to worship the divine Vedic God in favor of concocted religions and irreligions, with contemptible manners of reverence. Their societies were immoral and built on deceit, subjugation, and corruption. Therefore, it was thought that true Hindus should not come under their influence or embrace their beliefs, as they will be just as deserving of contempt as a mleccha.&lt;ref name="Marina2002"&gt;{{cite book | author=Marina Carter | title=Coolitude: An Anthology of the Indian Labour Diaspora | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V073gYvBrlcC&amp;pg=PA164 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | year=2002 | publisher=Anthem Press | isbn=978-1-84331-006-8 | pages=164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Portuguese [[Age of exploration]], Portuguese sailors noted that Hindus were reluctant to engage in [[maritime trade]] due to the kala pani proscription. In the eighteenth century, the [[bania (caste)|banias]] of [[North India]] even considered the crossing of the [[Indus River]] at [[Attock]] to be prohibited, and underwent purification rituals upon their return. However, not all Hindus adhered to the proscription, so as to gain monetary wealth. For instance, Hindu merchants were present in [[Burma]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and other places around Asia and Africa, as well as Australia.&lt;ref name="DonnaDirk"&gt;{{cite book  | editor =  Donna R.

== British period ==

=== Mutinies ===

The [[East India Company]] recruited several upper-caste [[sepoy|soldiers]], and adapted its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, the overseas service, considered polluting to their caste, was not required of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Barbara D. Metcalf and Thomas R. Metcalf | year=2006 | title=A Concise History of Modern India | edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-68225-8 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–26), the [[Bengal Army]] was ordered to go to [[Chittagong]]. Since no [[bullock cart]]s were available and since sea voyage was a taboo, the Indian soldiers were asked to march to Chittagong by land. The soldiers were concerned about the difficulty involved in a land march, and were also afraid that their superiors might force them to take a sea voyage if the march failed. As a result of these fears, the 47th Regiment refused to march.&lt;ref name="Spencer1890"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Spencer Walpole]] | title=A history of England from the conclusion of the great war in 1815 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoQUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA279 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | year=1890 | publisher=Longmans, Green | page=279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a [[Barrackpore Mutiny of 1824|mutiny on  2 November 1824 at Barrackpore]].&lt;ref name="Indu2000"&gt;{{cite book | author=Indu Ramchandani | title=Students' Britannica India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kpd9lLY_0-IC&amp;pg=PA165 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | year=2000 | publisher=Popular Prakashan | isbn=978-0-85229-760-5 | page=165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Services Enlistment Act of 1856 required the new recruits to serve overseas if asked. The serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that this requirement would be eventually extended to them.&lt;ref name="Philip2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=Philip Mason | title=A MATTER OF HONOUR: An Account Of The Indian Army, Its Officers And Men | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QqzAgAACAAJ | accessdate=2 February 2013 | year=2004 | publisher=Natraj Publishers | isbn=978-81-8158-012-2 | page = 261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Hindu soldiers viewed the Act as a potential threat to their faith. The resulting discontent was one of the causes of the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].&lt;ref name="John2006"&gt;{{cite book | author=John F. Riddick | title=The History of British India: A Chronology | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Es6x4u_g19UC&amp;pg=PA53 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | date=1 April 2006 | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | isbn=978-0-313-32280-8 | pages=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Viper New Jails Construction.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Cellular Jail]] was known as Kala Pani, as the overseas journey to the Andaman islands threatened the convicts with the loss of caste, resulting in social exclusion.]]
[[Cellular Jail]], the British Indian prison on the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] was known as Kala Pani: an incarceration in this jail threatened the convicts with the loss of caste and the resulting social exclusion.&lt;ref name="AlisonCarolyn2012"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Alison Bashford | author2=Carolyn Strange | title=Isolation: Places and Practices of Exclusion | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z72MP1zc4KgC&amp;pg=PA37 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | date=12 November 2012 | publisher=Psychology Press | isbn=978-0-415-30980-6 | page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indentured laborer diaspora ===

When slavery was abolished in British colonies (such as [[Mauritius]] in 1834), the authorities looked for [[unfree labor|indentured labor]] to replace the slaves who had been emancipated. The emissaries sent to India for this purpose were astute in attracting so-called "[[coolies]]" to the countries such as South Africa, Mauritius, Fiji and the Caribbean that requiring cheap labor, which were often presented as "promised lands."  But many prospective candidates for the distant colonies expressed their fears of crossing the Kala Pani. So the British often employed a stratagem to dispel the doubts of the indentured: they placed water from the Ganges in large cauldrons on the ships, to ensure the continuity of reincarnation beyond the Kala Pani. The sea voyage was then seen as less fearsome.

The Kala Pani theme features prominently in the [[Indo-Caribbean]] history,&lt;ref name="Khan2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=Aisha Khan | title=Callaloo Nation: Metaphors of Race and Religious Identity Among South Asians in Trinidad | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-ASYIjzdEkC&amp;pg=PA123 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | date=11 October 2004 | publisher=Duke University Press | isbn=978-0-8223-3388-3 | page=123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been elaborately discussed in the writings of [[V. S. Naipaul]].&lt;ref name="Ojwang2012"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dan Ojwang | title=Reading Migration and Culture: The World of East African Indian Literature | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQoGH1Vm15sC&amp;pg=PA55 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | date=15 December 2012 | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | isbn=978-1-137-26295-0 | page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauritian poet and critic [[Khal Torabully]], who is partly of [[Indo-Mauritian]] descent, describes the Kala Pani as a source not only of the dissolution of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], but also of beauty and reconstruction, leading to what he terms a "coral imaginary."

== Modern India ==

The [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati Temple]] does not allow a priest who has crossed the seas to enter the temple's [[sanctum sanctorum]].&lt;ref name="DNA_Udupi_pontiff"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_foreign-trip-may-cost-udupi-pontiff-ascension_1135925 | title = Foreign trip may cost Udupi pontiff ascension | publisher = [[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]] | accessdate = 2012-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Paryaya#Paryaya ritual at Udupi|ascension]] of [[Puttige matha guru parampara|Sugunendra Tirtha]] to the [[Udupi Sri Krishna Matha|Udupi Krishna Temple]] was opposed by some [[Ashta Mathas of Udupi|seers]], because he had visited foreign countries, thus committing the offence of ''saagarolanga'' (crossing the sea).&lt;ref name="TheHinduShiroor"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/29/stories/2007112959760300.htm | title = Shiroor seer backs Puttige swamiji | publisher = [[The Hindu]] | date = 2007-11-29 | accessdate = 2012-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a court verdict formally allowed his ascension.&lt;ref name="TheHinduRight"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/15/stories/2008011556610400.htm | title = Paryaya is my right: Puttige swamiji | publisher = [[The Hindu]] | date = 2008-01-15 | accessdate = 2012-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, both he and his opponent [[Vishwesha Teertha]] announced [[fasting|fasts]] to pressure each other on the issue.&lt;ref name="TheHinduIrrational"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/article2808191.ece | title = Shiroor Math seer terms fear of swamijis' foreign visits as irrational| publisher = [[The Hindu]] | date = 2002-01-17 | accessdate = 2012-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vishnunarayanan Namboothiri]], a noted poet who served as a priest at the [[Sreevallabha Temple]], was not allowed to enter the temple after he returned from an overseas trip to [[London]]. The temple authorities, led by the [[thantri]] (chief priest), asked him to go a thorough cleansing, penance and ''punaravrodha'' (reinstallation) before he would be allowed in again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rediff.com/news/jul/15jose.htm | title = Kerala priest loses his job 'cos he went to London | publisher = [[rediff.com]] | accessdate = 2012-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Namboothiri was asked to purify himself by reciting the [[Gayatri Mantra]] 1008 times, which he refused to do. The [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] supported him, calling the taboo an "outdated ritual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rediff.com/news/jul/22priest.htm | title = Kerala temple tamasha leaves two jobless, many angry and a few laughing | publisher = [[rediff.com]] | accessdate = 2012-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Travancore Devaswom Board]] also supported him, and fired two of its officials for refusing to his reinstatement. After the board served the thantri a show-cause notice, Namboothiri was allowed back after purification by sprinkling of holy water ([[theertham]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rediff.com/news/jul/26kerala.htm | title = And thus ended the temple tamasha... | publisher = [[rediff.com]] | accessdate = 2012-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Affresco dell'aspetto antico della basilica costantiniana di san pietro nel IV secolo.jpg|thumb|The truss roof of the 4th-century church [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Rome]]. The triangular frame of beams of the main nave is largely self-supporting, since the forces are carried along the beams rather than acting vertically on them.]]

The '''list of ancient roofs''' comprises [[roof|roof constructions]] from [[Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture]] ordered by clear span. Most buildings in [[classical Greece]] were covered by traditional prop-and-lintel constructions, which often needed to include interior colonnades. In [[Magna Graecia|Sicily]] truss roofs presumably appeared as early as 550 BC.&lt;ref name="Hodge 1960, 41"/&gt; Their potential was fully realized in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period which saw over 30 m wide trussed roofs spanning the rectangular spaces of monumental public buildings such as [[Roman temple|temple]]s, [[basilica]]s, and later [[Church (building)|church]]es. Such spans were thrice as large as the widest prop-and-lintel roofs and only superseded by the largest [[List of Roman domes|Roman domes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ulrich|2007|pp=148f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tafel paepste.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the popes buried in [[St Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] (their names in Latin and the year of their burial)]]

This chronological '''list of [[pope]]s''' corresponds to that given in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' under the heading "I Sommi Pontefici Romani" (The Supreme Pontiffs of Rome), excluding those that are explicitly indicated as [[antipope]]s. Published every year by the [[Roman Curia]], the ''Annuario Pontificio'' attaches no consecutive numbers to the popes, stating that it is impossible to decide which side represented at various times the legitimate succession, in particular regarding [[Pope Leo VIII]], [[Pope Benedict V]] and some mid-11th-century popes.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2012'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 12*&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 edition of the ''Annuario Pontificio'' introduced "almost 200 corrections to its existing biographies of the popes, from St Peter to John Paul II". The corrections concerned dates, especially in the first two centuries, birthplaces and the family name of one pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-1597?l=english |title=Corrections Made to Official List of Popes |accessdate=21 October 2008 |publisher=ZENIT |date=5 June 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119001522/http://www.zenit.org/article-1597?l=english |archive-date=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[Pope (word)|pope]]'' ([[Latin]]: ''papa'' "father") is used in several Churches to denote their high spiritual leaders (for example [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Pope]]). This title in English usage usually refers to the head of the Catholic Church. The Catholic pope uses various titles by tradition, including ''[[Summus Pontifex]]'', ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', and ''[[Servus servorum Dei]]''. Each title has been added by unique historical events and unlike other papal prerogatives, is not incapable of modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12260a.htm#V |title=Papal Primacy of honour: titles and insignia |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1911 |accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermannus Contractus]] may have been the first historian to number the popes continuously. His list ends in 1049 with [[Pope Leo IX]] as number 154. Several changes were made to the list during the 20th century. [[Antipope Christopher]] was considered legitimate for a long time. [[Pope-elect Stephen]] was considered legitimate under the name ''Stephen II'' until the 1961 edition, when his name was erased. Although these changes are no longer controversial, a number of modern lists still include this "first Pope Stephen II". It is probable that this is because they are based on the 1913 edition of the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', which is in the public domain.

A significant number of these popes have been [[List of canonised popes|recognized as saints]], including 48 out of the first 50 consecutive popes, and others are in the sainthood process. Of the first 31 popes, 28 died as martyrs (see [[List of murdered popes]]).

== Notes on numbering of popes ==

A number of anomalies in the list given above need further explanation:

* [[Antipope Felix II|Felix II]] (356–357), [[Boniface VII]] (974, 984–985), [[Antipope John XVI|John&amp;nbsp;XVI]] (997–998), [[Antipope Benedict X|Benedict&amp;nbsp;X]] (1058–1059) and [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander&amp;nbsp;V]] (1409–1410) are not listed because they are all considered [[antipope]]s.&lt;ref name="ceanti"&gt;{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Antipope}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The numbering of popes named Felix has been amended to omit antipope [[Antipope Felix II|Felix&amp;nbsp;II]]; however, most lists still call the last two Felixes: [[Pope Felix III|Felix&amp;nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Felix IV|Felix&amp;nbsp;IV]]. Additionally, there was an antipope [[antipope Felix V|Felix&amp;nbsp;V]].&lt;ref name="ceanti" /&gt;
* There has never been a pope [[Pope John XX|John&amp;nbsp;XX]] as a result of [[Pope John (numbering)|confusion of the numbering system]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="cechron"&gt;{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Chronological Lists of Popes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pope-elect Stephen]], who died before being consecrated, has not been on the Vatican's official list of popes since 1961, but appears on lists dating from before 1960.&lt;ref name="cechron" /&gt; The numbering of following popes called ''Stephen'' are nowadays given as [[Pope Stephen II]] (752–757) to [[Pope Stephen IX]] (1057–1058), rather than Stephen&amp;nbsp;III to Stephen&amp;nbsp;X.
* When Simon de Brion became pope in 1281, he chose to be called ''Martin''. At that time, [[Pope Marinus I|Marinus&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Pope Marinus II|Marinus&amp;nbsp;II]] were mistakenly considered to be Martin II and Martin III respectively, and so, erroneously, Simon de Brion became [[Pope Martin IV]].&lt;ref name="cemartin"&gt;{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Pope Martin IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pope Donus II]], said to have reigned about 974, never existed. The belief resulted from the confusion of the title ''dominus'' (lord) with a proper name.
* [[Pope Joan]] also never existed; however, legends about her may have originated from stories about the [[Saeculum obscurum|pornocracy]].&lt;ref name="ceJoan"&gt;{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Popess Joan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The status of [[Antipope John XXIII]] was uncertain for hundreds of years, and was finally settled in 1958 when Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli announced his own name as John&amp;nbsp;XXIII. Baldassare Cossa, who was Antipope John&amp;nbsp;XXIII, served as a Cardinal of the reunited church before his death in 1419 and his remains are found in the [[Florence Baptistery]].
* Those who believe in [[Sedevacantism]] say that there have been no legitimate popes since Pius XII or John XXIII. This is because they consider all popes since the [[Second Vatican Council]] to be [[heretic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yUqp1_31B-MC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Sedevacantism#v=onepage&amp;q=Sedevacantism&amp;f=false Weaver, MJ., and Appleby, RS., ''Being Right: Conservative Catholics in America'', Indiana University Press, 1 Jan 1995, p. 257.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gxEONS0FFlsC&amp;pg=PA566&amp;dq=Sedevacantism#v=onepage&amp;q=Sedevacantism&amp;f=false Flinn, FK., ''Encyclopedia of Catholicism'', 2007, p. 566.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[yeshiva]]s, [[midrasha]]s and [[Hebrew school]]s in [[Israel]]''' and the [[West Bank]].

A [[yeshiva]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ישיבה) is a center for the study of [[Torah]], the [[Talmud]], and character development in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. A yeshiva usually is led by a rabbi called a Rosh Yeshiva (Head of the Yeshiva). A midrasha ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: מדרשה) or seminary is an equivalent center for Jewish women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2258">'''Lithomancy''' is a form of [[divination]] by which the future is told using stones or the reflected light from said stones. The practice is most popular in the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Cheung  | first = Theresa  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World  | publisher = Harper Element  | series =   | volume =   | edition =   | year = 2006  | location =   | pages = 401  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn =  978-0-00-721148-7  | mr =   | zbl =   | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest verified account of lithomancy comes from [[Photius]], the patriarch of [[Constantinople]], who describes a physician named Eusebius using a stone called a [[wikt:baetulus|baetulum]] to perform the ritual.&lt;ref name="book1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Encyclopaedia of Occultism|last=Spence|first= Lewis|publisher=Dover Publications|page=252|year=2003|ISBN=978-0-486-42613-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some writers also claim that [[Helenus]] predicted the destruction of [[Troy]] using the ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Elworthy  | first = Frederick Thomas   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Evil Eye the Origins and Practices of Superstition  | publisher = Kessinger Publishing  | series =   | volume =   | edition =   | year = 2003  | location =   | pages = 444–445  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zQRFFQuhLnYC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=%22lithomancy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eQITTozdB86ChQfEm_H1DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lithomancy%22&amp;f=false  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-0-7661-3242-9  | mr =   | zbl =   | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

In modern lithomancy{{clarify|date=August 2015}}, 13 stones are tossed onto a board and a prediction made based on the pattern in which they fall. The stones are representative of various concepts: fortune, magic, love, news, home life and the astrological planets of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the sun, and the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Witchcraft Today: An Encyclopedia of Wiccan and Neopagan Traditions|last=Lewis|first=James R.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|ISBN=978-1-57607-134-2|year=1999|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahamandaleshwar''' (or '''Maha Mandaleshwar''') is a title used by some [[Hindu]] [[monk]]s of the [[Dashanami_Sampradaya|Dashanami]] order of renunciates ("swamis") founded by Shankaracharya. A person called Mahamandaleshwar has been elevated by his peers to the highest level of traditional, [[Hindu]] spiritual guardianship. Today India has 530 Mahamandaleshwars who carry on the work begun by [[Adi Shankara]]charya 1200 years ago.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

Literally, "Mahamandaleshwar" means "Superior of great and/or numerous monasteries" or "Superior of a religious district or province" (maha = great, [[mandala]] = district, [[ishwara]] = head, sovereign). 
There are two systems of organization in the dashanami order. Each of the ten names (dasha = ten, nami = name), which is appended to a monk's given name at initiation, is assigned to one of the four cardinal monastic seats founded by Shankaracharya and presided over by his direct successors at [[Joshimath]] in North India, [[Dwarka]] in the West, [[Shringeri]] in the South and [[Puri]] in the East.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

==Akhara system==
The other system is the [[akhara]] system of which the Mahamandaleshwaras are a part. Their origin dates from the early days of Islamic invasions into India (around or just prior to 1000 CE) when many monks became the targets of murderous attacks. In order to protect themselves, they formed "regiments" of monk-warriors who, to this day, preserve the traditional martial arts of India in addition to their spiritual practices. So in addition to being a way to organize the orders at a local level they have historically also served as paramilitary regiments with the Mahamandaleshwaras as generals, as it were, of these regiments.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

As of now, Shri Ashutoshgiri Goswami (who is also Mahant of Bhimnath Mahadev, Gujarat) is Mahamandaleshwar crowned by Swami Avdeshanandji at the pious (and Equally Popular) [[Kumbha Mela]].  At the same time, Swami Avdeshanandji announced Bhimnath Mahadev as a "Pith" and Mahant of Bhimnath will also be called as "Pithadheesh".

'''''Malaysia and the Club of Doom''''' (The Collapse of The Islamic Countries) is a book published in 2006 by [[Syed Akbar Ali]] who argues that countries with a [[Muslim]] majority population have collapsed economically, politically and socially.

==Theses==
With a particular focus on [[Malaysia]], the thesis of the book is that growing [[Islamization|Islamisation]] of the political and social climate in Islamic countries are causing democracy and freedom to be threatened by religious irrationalism. He attempts to show how the curtailing of [[democracy]] and [[freedom of speech]] have caused those countries to collapse.  He further draws a distinction between Islam and its current practises, and offers his perspective that current practises of Muslims are not in vein with the true meaning of [[Islam]] with that being the underlying cause for the collapse of those countries.

The book takes pains to stress that many practises that define Islam on the world stage like stringent laws, cruel punishments and irrational beliefs cannot be found in the [[Quran]]. Syed Akbar Ali then proceeds to show that many of these extra Quranic beliefs and practises which have brought about the downfall of the Muslims are actually taken from the [[Bible]].

In the Malaysian context, his book also exposes a masquerade whereby certain 'Islamic' laws pertaining to divorce are actually a reworded version of [[English common law|English Law]] taken from the Marriage and Divorce Act -  a left over of British colonialism. The book also dismisses '[[Islamic banking]]' as 'Arabic banking' i.e. conventional banking with Arabic prefixes attached for camouflage.

==Author==
Syed Akbar Ali (49 years' old) is well known among the Malaysian [[intelligentsia]], especially among its Muslim intellectuals.  A graduate of an American university who developed a career in banking, Syed was also an often controversial newspaper columnist - pushing the envelope on free and unfettered discussion on religious and political issues in Malaysia.

His debut book ''To Digress A Little'', published in July 2005, stirred much discussion in Malaysia for its frank and honest appraisal of Malaysia's [[affirmative action]] policies which it claims have now outlived their usefulness.

'''Michael MacAuliffe''', also known as '''Max Arthur Macauliffe''' (10 September 1841 − 15 March 1913), was a senior Sikh-British administrator, prolific scholar and author. Macauliffe is renowned for his translation of [[Sikh]] scripture and history into English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mocavo.com/Studies-in-the-History-of-Religions-Presented-to-Crawford-Howell-Toy-by-Pupils-Colleagues-and-Friends/103921/180 "Studies in the History of Religions" Page 170, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

MacAuliffe was born at [[Newcastle West]], [[County Limerick]], on 10 September 1841. He was educated at Newcastle School, Limerick, and Springfield College. He attended [[Queen's College Galway]] between 1857 and 1863, being awarded junior scholarships in the Literary Division of the Arts Faculty for 1857–58, 1858–59, and 1859–60. He was awarded a B.A. degree with first class honours in Modern Languages in 1860. He obtained a senior scholarship in Ancient Classics for 1860-1, and a senior scholarship in Modern Languages and History for 1861-62. He also served as Secretary of the college's [[Literary and Debating Society (NUI, Galway)|Literary and Debating Society]] for the 1860–61 session.

MacAuliffe entered the [[Indian Civil Service]] in 1862, and arrived in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in February 1864. He was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Punjab in 1882, and a Divisional Judge in 1884. He retired from the Indian Civil Service in 1893.

MacAuliffe also wrote a rendition, English translation of the Sacred scriptures of the Sikh religion, the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]''. He also wrote ''The Sikh Religion: its Gurus, Sacred Writings and Authors'' (six volumes, Oxford University Press, 1909). He was assisted in his works by [[Pratap Singh Giani]], a Sikh scholar.

Macauliffe converted to [[Sikhism]] in the 1860s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuigalway.ie/english/tadhg_foley.html University of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207082413/http://www.nuigalway.ie/english/tadhg_foley.html |date=2012-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was even derided by his British employers for having "turned a Sikh"&lt;ref name="SikhChic"&gt;[http://www.sikhchic.com/article-detail.php?id=207&amp;cat=18 SikhChic]&lt;/ref&gt;

His personal assistant remarked in his memoirs that on his death bed, Macauliffe could be heard reciting the Sikh morning prayer, [[Japji Sahib]], ten minutes before he died.&lt;ref name="SikhChic"/&gt;

Macauliffe is held in high esteem amongst Sikh communion, for his translation into English of the Sikh Scriptures, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. At a lecture at the annual session of the Lahore [[Singh Sabha]] Macauliffe proclaimed that the Guru Granth was matchless as a book of holy teachings.&lt;ref name="SikhChic"/&gt;

He was awarded the degree of M.A. (honoris causa) by his alma mater in 1882. MacAuliffe died at his home in London on 15 March 1913.

Ron Hubbard]]'s life, accounts of his military career are much disputed.&lt;ref name="Streeter"&gt;[[#Streeter|Streeter]], pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; His account of his military service later formed a major element of his public persona, as depicted by his [[Scientologist]] followers.&lt;ref name="Atack-p70"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of Scientology]] presents Hubbard as a "much-decorated war hero who commanded a [[corvette]] and during hostilities was crippled and wounded."&lt;ref name="Lamont"&gt;[[#Lamont|Lamont]], pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scientology publications, he served as a "Commodore of Corvette squadrons" in "all five theaters of World War II" and was awarded "twenty-one medals and palms" for his service.&lt;ref name="Rolph p16"&gt;[[#Rolph|Rolph]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was "severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded" to a military hospital, where he "worked his way back to fitness, strength and full perception in less than two years, using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron|authorlink=L. Ron Hubbard|title=Dianetics Today|publisher=Church of Scientology of California Publications Organization United States|location=Los Angeles, CA|year=1975|isbn=0-88404-036-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, his official Navy service records indicate that "his military performance was, at times, substandard", that he was only awarded a handful of campaign medals and that he was never injured or wounded in combat and was never awarded a [[Purple Heart]].&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sappel, Joel |author2=Welkos, Robert W. |title=The Mind Behind the Religion, Chapter 2: Creating the Mystique: Hubbard's Image Was Crafted of Truth, Distorted by Myth |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-scientology062490,0,2050131,full.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1990-06-24 |accessdate=2009-07-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612145705/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-scientology062490%2C0%2C2050131%2Cfull.story |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his military service was spent ashore in the [[continental United States]] on administrative or training duties. He briefly commanded two [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine vessels]], the [[USS YP-422|USS ''YP-422'']] and [[USS PC-815|USS ''PC-815'']], in coastal waters off [[Massachusetts]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]] in 1942 and 1943 respectively. He was removed from command of both vessels and rated by his superiors as being unsuitable for independent duties and "lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation". Although Hubbard asserted that he had attacked and crippled or sunk two [[Imperial Japanese Navy submarines|Japanese submarines]] off Oregon while in command of the USS ''PC-815'', his claim was rejected by the commander of the [[Northwest Sea Frontier]] after a subsequent investigation. He was hospitalized for the last seven months of his active service, not with injuries but with an acute [[duodenal ulcer]].&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24" /&gt;

The Church of Scientology rejects the official record and insists that Hubbard had a ''second'' set of records that the U.S. Navy has concealed. According to the Church's chief spokesman, if it was true that Hubbard had not been injured, "the injuries that he handled by the use of Dianetics procedures were never handled, because they were injuries that never existed; therefore, Dianetics is based on a lie; therefore, Scientology is based on a lie."&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright, Lawrence (February 14, 2011)."[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all The Apostate: Paul Haggis vs. the Church of Scientology]". ''The New Yorker''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Montana Army National Guard and US Marine Corps Reserve==

Hubbard's first military service was with the [[Montana Army National Guard]], which he joined at the age of 16 in October 1927 while still at school, falsely stating that his age was 18. Enlisting at the State Armory in his home town of [[Helena, Montana]], he served as a private in the Headquarters Company of [[163rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|163rd Infantry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1930, at the age of 19, he joined the [[Marine Corps Reserve]] 20th Regiment, a training unit connected with [[George Washington University]] where he was a student from 1930–32.

Hubbard attributed his service in the regiment to his need for "a little recreation. Life was dull. Fellow came up to me and he says, 'The Marine Reserves are organizing a twentieth regiment. Why don't you come down?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron|title=Motion and Emotion|date=August 16, 1951|series=Special course in human evaluation|publisher=Golden Era Productions|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made the dubious claim of being rapidly promoted to the rank of [[First Sergeant]]; Hubbard later explained his unusually rapid promotion as being due to his unit being newly formed and his superiors being unable to "find anyone else who could drill."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. ''Research and Discovery Series'', volume 7, pg. 98, as cited in [[#Atack|Atack]], p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he was rated 'excellent' for military efficiency, obedience and sobriety.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 1931, Hubbard received an [[honorable discharge]] along with the annotation "not to be re-enlisted."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

===Western Pacific service===
[[File:USS Chaumont AP-5 off Shanghai 1937.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=The USS ''Chaumont'', a large light-coloured transport vessel with a smaller vessel alongside, against a background of shorefront buildings and docked ships|The [[USS Samaritan (AH-10)|USS ''Chaumont'']], which transported L. Ron Hubbard back from Australia to the United States in 1942.]]
Hubbard joined the [[United States Navy]] during the summer of 1941, a few months before the United States entered the Second World War. He applied in March 1941 and was commissioned as a [[lieutenant, junior grade]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] on July 19, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard was called to active duty in November.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;  He specifically volunteered for "Special Service (intelligence duties)", an assignation recorded on his commission papers. He spent only a brief time in this nominal role with the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]. After four months working in public relations and at the [[Naval Oceanographic Office|US Hydrographic Office]], he spent three weeks at the [[Third Naval District]] in New York training for the role of Intelligence Officer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's training was curtailed by the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, and on December 18 he was sent to the [[Philippines]] via [[Australia]]. He was put ashore in [[Brisbane]] in January 1942 when his ship was re-routed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordered back to the United States aboard the transport vessel [[USS Samaritan (AH-10)|USS ''Chaumont'']] the following month at the instigation of the US Naval Attaché to Australia, who cabled Washington to complain:

{{quote|By assuming unauthorized authority and attempting to perform duties for which he has no qualifications, he became the source of much trouble... This officer is not satisfactory for independent duty assignment. He is garrulous and tries to give impressions of his importance. He also seems to think he has unusual ability in most lines. These characteristics indicate that he will require close supervision for satisfactory performance of any intelligence duty.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#Atack|Atack]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard and the Church of Scientology presented a number of different accounts of his time in the western Pacific. In 1963, Hubbard told Australian journalists that he had been "the only anti-aircraft battery in Australia in 1941–42... There was me and a [[Thompson submachine gun]]... I was a mail officer and I was replaced, I think, by a Captain, a couple of commanders and about 15 junior officers."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "An interview granted to the Australian Press on January 10th 1963 at Saint Hill Manor ... by L. Ron Hubbard." Hubbard Communications Office, 1963. Quoted in [[#Atack|Atack]], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard stated on another occasion that he had been "one of the first officers back from the upper battle areas" and that he had "sent on my own authority, four cargo ships loaded to the gunwales with machine gun ammunition, rifle ammunition and [[quinine]] up to [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]]." When "Melbourne found out ... there were enough troops in the area so the danger was over, so I went home. I wrote myself some orders and reported back to the US."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hubbard | first=L. Ron | authorlink=L.

He was cut off by invading Japanese "and was only able to escape the island after scrambling into a rubber raft and paddling out to meet an Australian destroyer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=A Glimpse Into the Life of L.

It was in this latter capacity that he eventually saw action on the island of Java, and only eluded capture through a daring escape on a raft.&lt;ref name="Ron-the-poet"&gt;{{cite book | title=L.

Ron Hubbard Library | year=1995 | id=ASIN B001B1M0K0 | accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1956 lecture to Scientologists, Hubbard said:

{{quote|I was flown in from the South Pacific as the first casualty to be shipped out of the South Pacific war back to the States. The war had been started in Pearl Harbor, and I'd been down in the South Pacific and – a lot of things happened down there. And the outfits down there were pretty well wiped out, as you can remember before the US and Great Britain started to fight and go back in. All right.

Most of the guys that were shipped out of there who had been wounded, were shipped out by slow boat. And I didn't, I wasn't that seriously done in. I hooked a ride on the [[Secretary of the Navy]]'s plane; produced the right set of orders (I hope nobody ever kept them on file) and got flown home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron | title=The Game of Life (Exteriorization and Havingness)|date=1956-02-07|publisher=Golden Era Productions|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In another lecture of the same year, Hubbard provided an alternative version of his return to the United States:

{{quote|I picked up a telephone, called the Secretary of [the] Navy. See, and I said, "I'm tired of this place. I'd like to leave." And he said, "Yeah." I said, "Yeah, I've got some important despatches. As a matter of fact, we've got enough despatches here to practically sink the Japanese navy if they had to carry them. There's a lot of traffic and stuff like that, and so forth." So he sent his plane down and picked me up and flew me home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron | title=Definition of Organisation, Part I|date=1956-11-08|publisher=Golden Era Productions|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The US Navy's files do not record Hubbard spending any time on Java&lt;ref name="Streeter" /&gt; and do not show any evidence of wounds or injuries sustained in combat.&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24" /&gt;

===Atlantic service: USS ''YP-422'' and after===
[[File:Yp422 large.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=The USS YP-422, a small two-masted vessel with several sailors visible on deck|The yard patrol craft ''USS YP-422'', L. Ron Hubbard's first command, a few days before its official commissioning]]
Hubbard was posted to the Office of the Cable Censor in [[New York City]] after returning to the US at the end of March 1942. As the office had recently ceased to be an organ of Naval Intelligence, his status was amended to deck officer. He was also promoted (as part of a batch of other officers of the same grade) on June 15, 1942 to lieutenant, senior grade, the highest rank he was to hold during his active service.

In June 1942 he requested that he be assigned to sea duty in the [[Caribbean]]; he was sent instead to the shipyard of [[George Lawley &amp; Son]] of [[Neponset, Massachusetts]], where the fishing trawler MV ''Mist'' was being converted for military use as a naval yard patrol (YP) vessel.&lt;ref name="Atack-p73-74"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The navy commandeered numerous fishing vessels and redesignated them as YP boats, tasked with defending coastal waters against enemy submarines and delivering food and equipment to military personnel offshore; they were particularly prized for having refrigeration units.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lotchin|Lotchin]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was commissioned as the [[USS YP-422|USS ''YP-422'']] on July 28, 1942, having been refitted as a freighter armed with a 3-inch [[deck gun]] and two .30-caliber [[machine gun]]s.&lt;ref name="Malia"&gt;{{cite news|last=Malia|first=Joseph|title=Inside the Church of Scientology: Judge found Hubbard lied about achievements|work=Boston Herald|date=1998-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August, the ''YP-422'' put to sea from the [[Boston Navy Yard]] to carry out a 27-hour training exercise.&lt;ref name="Atack-p73-74" /&gt;

However, Hubbard fell out with a senior officer at the shipyard and sent a critical memorandum to the Vice-Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) in [[Washington, D.C.]] The Commandant of the Navy Yard responded on 25 September 1942 by informing the VCNO that, in his view, Hubbard was "not temperamentally fitted for independent command" and requesting that Hubbard be removed and ordered to "other duty under immediate supervision of a more senior officer." Hubbard duly lost his command on October 1, 1942 and was ordered to New York, ending his service in the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Atack-p73-74" /&gt;

Various accounts of Hubbard's service in the North Atlantic have been put forward by the Church of Scientology and Hubbard himself. The Church of Scientology states in one publication that Hubbard "took command of an antisubmarine escort vessel with Atlantic convoys".&lt;ref name="Ron-the-poet" /&gt; In a 1954 lecture, Hubbard asserted that he had been sent "to [[Boston]] in the very early part of the war to take command of a [[corvette]]" and had been given a crew made up of convicts from the [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hubbard | first=L. Ron | title=Space | date=April 29, 1954 | series=5th American Advanced Clinical Course | publisher=Golden Era Productions|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard "corvettes, North Atlantic. And I went on fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and doing other things and so on. And I finally got a set of orders for the ship. By that time I had the squadron."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hubbard | first=L. Ron | title=Welcome Address | date=November 7, 1959 | series=Melbourne Congress | publisher=Golden Era Productions|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographical accounts published by the Church of Scientology have described Hubbard as commanding the "Fourth British Corvette Squadron"&lt;ref name="Atack-p70" /&gt; and Hubbard himself stated that he "was running British corvettes during the war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hubbard | first=L. Ron | title=E-Meter Talk and Demo | date=May 7, 1961 | series=Saint Hill Special Briefing Course | publisher=Golden Era Productions|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biographical interview with Hubbard published in 1956 speaks of him commanding "the former British corvette, the ''Mist''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Certainty magazine | year=1956 | publisher=Church of Scientology of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The only British naval vessel named ''Mist'' was an [[Admiralty drifter]], one of a number of small wooden vessels constructed for the [[Royal Navy]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Young|Young]], p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;) Hubbard also asserted that he had sustained wounds "aboard a corvette in the North Atlantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=L.

In November 1942, Hubbard was sent to the Submarine Chaser Training Center in [[Miami, Florida]] for training on [[submarine chaser]] vessels. He subsequently undertook a ten-day anti-submarine warfare training course at the Fleet Sound School in [[Key West]] and on January 17, 1943 he was posted to the Albina Engine &amp; Machine Works in [[Portland, Oregon]], where he was to take command of the subchaser [[USS PC-815|USS ''PC-815'']] when she was commissioned.&lt;ref name="Atack-p74-75"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific service: ''USS PC-815''===

[[File:Uss pc-815 1.jpg|250px|left|thumb|alt=The USS PC-815, a single-masted vessel running at speed with a large wake, and with a deck gun prominent on the bow|The newly completed subchaser USS ''PC-815'' running trials on the [[Columbia River]] on April 13, 1943.]]
When Hubbard arrived in Portland, the USS ''PC-815'' was in the last stages of its construction. The ship, a 173&amp;nbsp;ft (53 m) steel-hulled subchaser of the ''PC-461'' class, had been laid down on October 10, 1942 at the Albina shipworks. She was commissioned on April 21, 1943 with Hubbard in command and Lt (jg) Thomas Moulton, an officer with whom he had studied in Florida, as the ship's [[executive officer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The ship left Portland on May 18 to travel down the [[Columbia River]] to [[Astoria, Oregon]], where she took on ammunition. After participating for a day in an air-sea rescue operation, USS ''PC-815'' was ordered to sail to [[San Diego]] to commence its shakedown cruise.&lt;ref&gt;USS ''PC-815'' logbook. National Archives &amp; Records Administration, College Park, MD&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early hours of May 19, ''PC-815's'' sonar detected what the crew believed to be an enemy submarine off [[Cape Lookout (Oregon)|Cape Lookout]], about ten to twelve miles offshore.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two and a half days, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire a total of 35 [[depth charge]]s and a number of gun rounds to target what Hubbard believed to be two [[Imperial Japanese Navy submarines]]. The ''PC-815'' was joined by the US Navy [[K class blimp|blimps ''K-39'' and ''K-33'']], the [[US Coast Guard]] patrol boats ''Bonham'' and ''78302'' and the subchasers USS ''SC-536'' and USS ''SC-537'' to assist it in the search for the suspected enemy vessels. Hubbard was given temporary command of the vessels on the afternoon of May 19. The larger subchaser ''PC-778'' also joined the submarine search, though it found no indication of submarines and its commander was subsequently castigated by Hubbard for his refusal to lay its own larger stock of depth charges or resupply the ''PC-815''.&lt;ref name="Atack-77-78"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard stated in his eighteen-page after-action report that he had intended to force the submarine to surface so that it could be attacked by the surface vessels' guns. He reported that his vessel had seen oil on the surface, though the ''PC-815'' took no samples, and asserted that the blimps had seen air bubbles, oil and a periscope, though the blimps' own reports did not corroborate this. No wreckage was seen, despite the heavy depth-charging. The ''PC-815'' sustained some minor damage and three crew were injured during the incident when the ship's radio antenna was accidentally hit by gunfire. At midnight on 21 May, with depth charges exhausted and the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by any other ship, ''PC-815'' was ordered back to Astoria.&lt;ref name="Atack-77-78" /&gt;

The incident attracted the attention of the naval high command, as there had been a verified [[Bombardment of Fort Stevens|Japanese submarine attack]] against [[Fort Stevens (Oregon)|Fort Stevens]] about 50 miles further north in June 1942 and there had been an [[Battle of Los Angeles|invasion scare]] in southern California earlier in 1942. Hubbard claimed to have "definitely sunk, beyond doubt" one submarine and critically damaged another. His view was not shared by his superiors. After reviewing the action reports and interviewing Hubbard and the other commanders present, Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]] noted: "An analysis of all reports convinces me that there was no submarine in the area. Lieutenant Commander Sullivan states that he was unable to obtain any evidence of a submarine except one bubble of air which is unexplained except by turbulence of water due to a depth charge explosion. The commanding officers of all ships except the ''PC-815'' state they had no evidence of a submarine and do not think a submarine was in the area."&lt;ref name=Atack7779 /&gt; Fletcher also noted that there was a "known magnetic deposit in the area in which depth charges were dropped." The clear implication was that Hubbard had been targeting the deposit all along.&lt;ref name=Atack7779&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], pp. 77–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-132"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], pp. 132–137&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron | title=CRA Triangle | date= October 23, 1956 | series = Fifteenth American Advanced Clinical Lectures | publisher=Golden Era Publications|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Hubbard nonetheless continued to believe that he had sunk at least one Japanese submarine. Years later, in 1956, he told Scientologists:

{{quote|I dropped the ''[[Japanese submarine I-176|I-76]]'' or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine down into the mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor. And that was that.&lt;ref name="CRA Triangle" /&gt;}}

In another lecture, he commented:

{{quote|I know one officer that was reprimanded for taking on a submarine three times the size of his ship and sinking it – a Japanese submarine. And he was called in and reprimanded. That doesn't sound possible, does it?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron|title=Standard Operating Procedure)|series=Philadelphia Doctorate Course|volume=42|date=1952-12-13|publisher=Golden Era Publications|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the war, the British [[Admiralty]] and the US Navy analysed the captured records of the Japanese navy to account for all of its vessels. Their reports do not list any Japanese submarine losses off the coast of the [[contiguous United States]] during the whole of the war.&lt;ref&gt;HM Admiralty, ''German, Italian and Japanese U-Boat Casualties during the War: Particulars of Destruction'', Cmd. 6843 (June 1946); US Navy, ''Japanese Naval and Merchant Shipping Losses during World War II by All Causes'' (February 1947)&lt;/ref&gt; According to military records, the ''I-76'' was destroyed off [[Buka Island]] in the western Pacific by [[USS Franks (DD-554)|USS ''Franks'']], [[USS Haggard (DD-555)|USS ''Haggard'']] and [[USS Johnston (DD-557)|USS ''Johnston'']] on 16 May 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fontenoy|Fontenoy]], pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard's crew however, who were very loyal to him, shared his conviction that they had engaged an enemy submarine. His second-in-command, Thomas Moulton, later asserted that the Navy had hushed up the incident, fearing that the presence of Japanese submarines so close to the Pacific coast might cause panic.&lt;ref name="Streeter" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Atack7779 /&gt;

[[File:Hubbardfitrep-b.gif|250px|right|thumb|alt=Fitness report page 2 following Coronados Incident.|A page from the official US Navy report and evaluation of Hubbard's fitness for command, following the Coronado Islands incident.]]

Following its return to Astoria, the USS ''PC-815'' was ordered to escort a new aircraft carrier to San Diego, where the subchaser was to participate in exercises.&lt;ref name="Miller-138"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; On June 28, 1943, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire four shells from the ship's 3-inch gun and a number of rifle and pistol shots in the direction of the [[Coronado Islands]], off which the ship anchored for the night. He did not realize that the islands belonged to [[Mexico]], an ally, nor that he had taken the USS ''PC-815'' into Mexican territorial waters.&lt;ref name="Miller-139"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were garrisoned by Mexican Navy personnel during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scheffler|Scheffler]], p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government complained and two days later, Hubbard found himself before a naval Board of Investigation in San Diego. He was found to have disregarded orders by carrying out an unsanctioned gunnery practice and violating Mexican waters. He was reprimanded and removed from command, effective July 7.&lt;ref name="Miller-139" /&gt; Rear Admiral Frank A. Braisted commented, in a fitness report written shortly after the Coronado incident, that he "''consider[ed] this officer lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation. He acts without forethought as to probable results. He is believed to have been sincere in his efforts to make his ship efficient and ready. Not considered qualified for command or promotion at this time. Recommend duty on a large vessel where he can be properly supervised.''"&lt;ref name="Atack-80"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day that Hubbard was sent a formal letter of admonition, he reported sick with complaints of [[epigastric]] pains and possible [[malaria]]. After 77 days on the sick list, it was finally determined that he was suffering from a [[duodenal ulcer]]. In October 1943, he asked to be transferred to [[landing craft]] and was sent on a six-week training course at the Naval Small Craft Training Center in [[San Pedro, California]].&lt;ref name="Miller-140"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;  He was then ordered in December 1943 to join the crew of the [[USS Algol (AKA-54)|USS ''Algol'']], an attack cargo ship, to assist with the ship's fitting out and crew training in Portland, Oregon. The vessel was commissioned in July 1944 with Hubbard aboard in the role of Navigation and Training Officer.&lt;ref name="Atack-81"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The next two months were occupied with training exercises off the California coast in preparation for the ship's envisaged departure in September for the western Pacific theater of operations.

Hubbard, however, applied instead to undertake a three-month training course in military administration at the School of Military Government, a faculty that had been established on the campus of [[Princeton University]] (but was not part of the University itself, although Hubbard later asserted that he had been a Princeton student).&lt;ref name="Atack-81" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-141"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; His commanding officer approved the detachment and gave Hubbard a generally good fitness report, rating him to be "of excellent personal and military character" though he "is very temperamental and often has his feelings hurt."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#Atack|Atack]], p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, a curious incident occurred aboard the USS ''Algol''; the ship's deck log records that Hubbard reported that he had discovered "an attempt at sabotage" consisting of a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] bottle filled with gasoline with a cloth wick inserted, concealed among the ship's cargo. A few hours later Hubbard was ordered to depart the ship and proceed to Princeton.&lt;ref name="Atack-81" /&gt;

In later years, Hubbard asserted that the 1955 film ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' was based on his service aboard the USS ''Algol'' with [[Henry Fonda]]'s eponymous character being based on Hubbard himself and [[James Cagney]]'s tyrannical character based on the commander of the ''Algol''.&lt;ref name="Atack-81" /&gt; In a February 1956 lecture, Hubbard told Scientologists: "There was a story made about that vessel [the ''Algol''], by the way. It was called ''Mister Roberts''. You may have seen this picture or read the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron|title=The Game of Life (Exteriorization and Havingness)|date=1956-02-07|publisher=Golden Era Publications|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Church of Scientology publication,

{{quote|At the end of the war, having been relegated because of his physical condition to the amphibious forces in the Pacific, he had the adventures which are reported on the screen in "''Mister Roberts''".

George Malko comments that "this [claim] has never been substantiated" and notes that the author of the original novel, [[Thomas Heggen]], "would only say about Roberts: "He is too good to be true, he is a pure invention.""

At the conclusion of his course at the School of Military Government, Hubbard failed to pass his examinations – finishing only mid-way down the class list – and did not qualify for an overseas posting. He was posted in January 1945 to the Naval Civil Affairs Staging Area in [[Monterey, California]] for further training but, as he later acknowledged, he became depressed and fell ill with a duodenal ulcer. He reported sick with stomach pains in April 1945 and spent the remainder of the war on the sick list as a patient in [[Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]] in [[Oakland, California]].&lt;ref name="Atack-82"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; A Church of Scientology account asserts that "eventual combat wounds would finally preclude him from serving with American occupation forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethics and Justice – L.

In October 1945, a Naval Board found that he was "considered physically qualified to perform duty ashore, preferably within the continental United States" in reflection of his chronic ulcer. He was discharged from the hospital and mustered out of active service on December 6, 1945.&lt;ref name="Atack-84"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his commission in October 1950.&lt;ref name="Rolph"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rolph|first=C.H.|title=Believe What You Like: What happened between the Scientologists and the National Association for Mental Health|publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited|year=1973|isbn=0-233-96375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Church of Scientology, he quit because the US Navy had "attempted to monopolize all his researches and force him to work on a project "to make man more suggestible" and when he was unwilling, tried to blackmail him by ordering him back to active duty to perform this function.

Quoted in [[#Miller|Miller]], p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard himself told Scientologists:

[T]his officer from the Office of Naval Research came to see me right here in Washington and he wanted me to go on as a civilian employee in order to use what I knew of the mind to make men more suggestible. And I smiled a feline smile. And I said, "No." And he smiled like something out of Faust, and he said to me, "Well, all you have to do is say 'No' and I will call you back to active duty because you still are an officer of the United States Navy." And with that purr he exited. ... So I went down here to the Washington Navy Yard, the Potomac River Naval Command, and I got my resignation accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L.

==Alleged war wounds==

As the psychologist and computer scientist [[Christopher Evans (computer scientist)|Christopher Evans]] has noted, "One aspect of [Hubbard's] war record that is particularly confused, and again typical of the mixture of glamour and obscurantism which surrounds Hubbard and his past, is the matter of wounds or injuries suffered on active service."&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;[[#Evans|Evans]], p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard asserted after the war that he had been "blinded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back... Yet I worked my way back to fitness and strength in less than two years, using only what I knew about Man and his relationship to the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "[http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/phlspher/page84.htm My Philosophy]", quoted by Atack, ''ibid'' p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts published by the Church of Scientology asserted that he had been "flown home in the late spring of 1942 in the secretary of the Navy's private plane as the first U.S.-returned casualty from the Far East". A 2006 publication goes further, describing him as "the first American casualty of South Pacific combat".&lt;ref&gt;''A filmed interview with L. Ron Hubbard: An Introduction to Scientology'' DVD, Golden Era, Los Angeles, 2006. This claim appears in the accompanying booklet (p. 9).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Moulton, Hubbard's executive officer on the USS ''PC-815'', testified in 1984 that Hubbard had said that he had been shot in the [[Dutch East Indies]], and that on another occasion Hubbard had told him that his eyes had been damaged by the flash of a large-caliber gun. Hubbard himself told Scientologists in a taped lecture that he had suffered eye injuries after having had "a bomb go off in my face."&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24"/&gt; He told [[Robert Heinlein]], the science fiction writer, that "both of his feet had been broken (drumhead-type injury) when his last ship was bombed." According to Heinlein, Hubbard said that he "had had a busy war – sunk four times and wounded again and again".&lt;ref&gt;Heinlein, Robert, in Sturgeon, Theodore, ''Godbody'', p. 10. New York : D.I. Fine, 1986. {{ISBN|0-917657-61-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard was said to have been "twice been pronounced dead" and to have spent a year in a naval hospital which he "utilized in the study of endocrine substances and protein".&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Christopher|title=Cults of Unreason|page=24|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=0-374-13324-7|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques that he developed "made possible not only his own recovery from injury, but helped other servicemen to regain their health".&lt;ref name="Malia" /&gt; On another occasion, Hubbard said that he had been hospitalized because "I was utterly exhausted. I'd just been in combat theater after combat theater, you see, with no rest, no nothing between."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron|title=Auditing Quality|date=1961-08-31|series=Saint Hill Special Briefing Course|publisher=Golden Era Publications|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This account was challenged by a series of writers and journalists from the mid-1970s onwards. Writing in 1974, Evans noted that the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] had confirmed that (even at that late stage in his life) Hubbard "receives $160 a month in compensation for disabilities incurred during the Second World War. However the conditions listed as being '40% disabling' are: duodenal ulcer, [[bursitis]] (right shoulder), [[arthritis]], and [[blepharoconjunctivitis]]." Evans noted: "a Navy Department spokesman has stated that 'an examination of Mr Hubbard's record does not reveal any evidence of injuries suffered while in the service of the United States Navy'."&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

Sixteen years later, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' obtained Hubbard's medical records through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The records stated that Hubbard had told doctors that he had been "lamed" by a chronic hip infection, and that his eye problems were the result of conjunctivitis caused by exposure to "excessive tropical sunlight". Hubbard's post-war correspondence with the VA was also included, including letters in which he requested psychiatric treatment to address his "long periods of moroseness" and "suicidal inclinations." He continued to complain to the VA about various physical ailments into the 1950s, well after he had founded [[Dianetics]]; the ''Times'' noted that, significantly, Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide "a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life, including allergies, arthritis, ulcers and heart problems."&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24" /&gt; Other documents on Hubbard's medical file stated that he had injured his back in 1942 after falling off a ship's ladder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=John|title=The Scientology Papers: The hidden Hubbard|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=1980-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's war medals have also been an issue of contention. Although the Church of Scientology has stated that Hubbard was "highly decorated for duties under fire,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Scientology – L. Ron Hubbard|url=http://www.scientology.org/interview/lronhubbard_5.html|publisher=Church of Scientology International|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the actual number of decorations said to have been awarded to Hubbard has varied considerably over the years. In a 1968 interview with British journalists, Hubbard showed his visitors sixteen war medals that he claimed to have been awarded.&lt;ref name="Miller-290"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, the Church of Scientology published a "Data Sheet on Lafayette Ron Hubbard" that stated that he had been awarded "Twenty-one medals and palms".&lt;ref name="Rolph" /&gt;  (The "Data Sheet" lists Hubbard as the Commanding Officer (CO) of the USS ''Howland'', however, there has never been a USS ''Howland'' in the history of the United States Navy.)

In May 1974, the Church asked the Navy Department to supply seventeen medals that he was said to have been awarded, including the [[Purple Heart]] and [[Navy Commendation Medal]], many of them with bronze [[service stars]] denoting participation in military campaigns or multiple bestowals of the same award. The Navy sent only four medals, noting, "The records in this Bureau fail to establish Mr. Hubbard's entitlement to the other medals and awards listed in your response." Hubbard responded by circulating to Scientologists a photograph of 21 medals and palms that he said he had been awarded and explained that he had actually won 28, but that the missing seven had been awarded to him in secret because the naval high command was embarrassed that he had sunk two Japanese submarines in the United States' "back yard".&lt;ref name="Miller-424"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 424–25&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 biography published by the Church of Scientology states that he was awarded 29 medals and awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Church of Scientology: 40th Anniversary|publisher=Bridge Publications|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 the Church of Scientology released a document, said to be a copy of Hubbard's official record of service, to support its assertion that Hubbard had been awarded 21 medals and decorations.&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24" /&gt; The Church asserts that Hubbard was awarded a "[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Unit Citation]] which is only awarded by the President to combat units that perform particularly meritorious service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keenan|first=Bob|title=From Ron's Office|journal=Fortean Times|date=January 2005|issue=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other awards listed on the record released by the Church is the British [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]],&lt;ref&gt;"[[:File:Hubbard alternative dd214.gif|Notice of Separation from the U.S. Naval Service – HUBBARD, LaFayette Ronald]]." Handout from the Church of Scientology, reproduced in Sappel, Joel; Welkos, Robert W. (1990-06-24). "The Mind Behind the Religion, Chapter 2: Creating the Mystique: Hubbard's Image Was Crafted of Truth, Distorted by Myth". ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; an award issued for service in the British armed forces in the ''First'' World War and that was never awarded by itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Duckers|Duckers]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's document also credits Hubbard with a Purple Heart with a Palm, implying two wounds received in action. However, the U.S. Navy uses gold and silver stars, not a palm, to indicate multiple wounds. The Church has distributed a photograph of medals said to have been won by Hubbard; two of the medals (specifically the [[National Defense Service Medal]] and the [[Armed Forces Reserve Medal]]) were not even created until after Hubbard left active service.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

The Church's record lists Hubbard as commanding the "USS ''Mist''". Although the USS ''YP-422'' was originally named the ''Mist'' when it was in civilian service, it was never called the USS ''Mist''; the only 20th century US Navy vessel of that name listed in the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'' left naval service in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mist|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/mist-ii.htm|work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|publisher=Department of the Navy|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Hubbard was six years old. It also lists the USS ''Howland'', a vessel that is not listed at all in the ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Index for Ships between Hoqua through Hugh L. Scott |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/h8-list.htm |work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |publisher=Department of the Navy |location=Washington, DC |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414060001/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/h8-list.htm |archivedate=2009-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is signed by "Howard D. Thompson, Lt. Cmdr.", who is not listed in the records of commissioned naval officers at that time. Archivist Eric Voelz of the [[National Personnel Records Center]] told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that the document is a forgery.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

The ''Los Angeles Times'' commented, and NPR later confirmed, that the US Navy's version of the same record – a [[DD Form 214]] – "indicates Hubbard received four medals during his Navy career, as well as two marksmanship medals" and noted "discrepancies" with the Scientology version.&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24" /&gt; The four medals that the US Navy's record credits to Hubbard were the [[American Defense Service Medal]], which was awarded to all members of the military in service at the time of the December 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the [[American Campaign Medal]], awarded to all service members who had performed duty in the [[American Theater of World War II|American Theater of Operations]] during the war; the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]], awarded to all who had served in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]; and the [[World War II Victory Medal]], awarded to all who served during World War II.&lt;ref name="Miller-144"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Department of the Navy, there was "no record of the additional decorations the church says Hubbard received."&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133561256/the-church-of-scientology-fact-checked|title=The Church Of Scientology, Fact-Checked|publisher=NPR|date=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church officials have argued the Navy's records were "not only grossly incomplete but perhaps were falsified to conceal Hubbard's secret activities as an intelligence officer."&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24" /&gt; In the 1980s the Church turned to [[L. Fletcher Prouty]], a former U.S. Army colonel, who said that Hubbard's records had been falsified to cover up his "intelligence background".&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt; Prouty, who died in 2001, was a prominent conspiracy theorist best known for advocating [[John F.

==Documenting Hubbard's military career==

[[File:Gerryarmstrong-2004-07-05.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=Head and shoulders photograph of a bearded smiling man in white T-shirt standing in front of a freight car bearing the words "Canadien National" and loading information|[[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]], formerly Hubbard's official biographical researcher, whose trial in 1984 led to Hubbard's military career being publicly disclosed.]]

Hubbard's military career has attracted comment from a number of journalists and writers over the years. The claims made by the Church of Scientology were not challenged by some early writers; [[C. R. Hewitt|C.H. Rolph]] quoted without comment a 1968 Scientology biographical sketch circulated to British [[Members of Parliament]] in which Hubbard's war service was summarized,&lt;ref name="Rolph" /&gt; and in 1971 [[Paulette Cooper]] described as "true" the claim that Hubbard "was severely injured in the war (and in fact was in a lifeboat for many days, badly injuring his body and his eyes in the hot Pacific sun)."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cooper|Cooper]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Others were more skeptical. George Malko attempted to verify Hubbard's "revealing, anonymously authored, and totally unsubstantiated biography" in 1970 but reported that "I was unable to confirm a single one of [Hubbard's] critical claims: that he had been crippled and blind, the nature of his 'discoveries,' and the medical records stating he had 'twice been pronounced dead.'" His inquiries were frustrated by the Navy's refusal to provide Hubbard's service record "without the written consent of the person whose records are concerned."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malko|Malko]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Information later released by the Navy and the Veterans Administration prompted some to express doubts. Christopher Evans commented in 1974 that "faced with this impressive, if annoyingly undetailed, record it is hard to assess the nature or extent of Hubbard's battle scars in the service of his country" but noted contradictions between claims of war wounds and the official record.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; In 1978, the ''Los Angeles Times'' described Hubbard's war record as "obscure" and quoted Navy spokesmen stating that Hubbard had not received a Purple Heart and had not been treated for any injuries sustained during his military career, contrary to the statements of the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilette|first=Robert|title=Scientology's L. Ron Hubbard ... Official Biographies Seem Larger Than Life|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1978-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1979, an amateur researcher, Michael Shannon, had gathered "a mountain of material which included some files that no one else had bothered to get copies of – for example, the log books of the Navy ships that Hubbard had served on, and his father's Navy service file."&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Michael Lynn. ''A Biography of L. Ron Hubbard''. 1979. Quoted in [[#Atack|Atack]], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Although Shannon was unable to find a publisher, he sent a hundred-page portfolio of materials, including copies of some of Hubbard's naval and college records, to a number of "concerned individuals". His work also found its way to the Church of Scientology's archivist, [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]], who was undertaking a project to research an official authorized biography of L. Ron Hubbard. According to [[Jon Atack]], "the archive largely confirmed Shannon's material. Armstrong and Shannon reached the same eventual destination from opposed starting points."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1980, Omar Garrison, a writer who had previously written two books favorable to Scientology, was hired by the Church to write Hubbard's biography based on the materials that Armstrong had collected.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], pp. 329–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong became disillusioned and left Scientology at the start of 1982. He was declared a "[[Suppressive Person]]" (an enemy of Scientology) by the Church. With Garrison's permission, Armstrong made copies of around 100,000 pages from the Hubbard archive and deposited them with attorneys for safe keeping. The Church responded by suing Armstrong for breach of confidence, theft and invasion of privacy. The suit went to trial in a California court in 1984 as ''[[Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong|Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong]]''. Hubbard's military career was a major focus of the case. Armstrong stated that he had "amassed approximately two thousand pages of documentation concerning Hubbard's wartime career: what he was doing what vessels he was on, fitness reports and medical and VA disability records. The truth is far different from the public representations."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#Corydon|Corydon]], p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison, who had by that time agreed to a settlement with the Church under which his manuscript would never be made public, told the court:

{{quote|The inconsistencies were implicit in various documents which Mr. Armstrong provided me with respect to Mr. Hubbard's ''curriculum vitae'', with respect to his Navy career, with respect to almost every aspect of his life. These undeniable and documented facts did not coincide with the official published biography that the church had promulgated.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[#Atack|Atack]], p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the trial's four weeks of testimony, the court heard evidence from Thomas S. Moulton, Hubbard's second-in-command aboard the USS ''PC-815''.

The decision, by Judge Paul Breckenridge, found that Armstrong's fears of persecution by the Church were reasonable, and thus his conduct in turning over the documents in his possession to his attorneys was also reasonable.&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24" /&gt; The judge issued a wide-ranging verdict, commenting of Hubbard that "the evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background and achievements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindsey|first=Robert|title=Scientology chief got millions, ex-aides say|work=New York Times|date=1984-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, a British judge ruled in a case heard at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] that Hubbard had made a number of "false claims" about his military career: "That he was a much decorated war hero. He was not. That he commanded a corvette squadron. He did not. That he was awarded the Purple Heart, a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action. He was not wounded and was not decorated. That he was crippled and blinded in the war and cured himself with Dianetics techniques. He was not crippled and was not blinded." The judge, [[John Latey (judge)|Mr. Justice Latey]], noted: "There is no dispute about any of this. The evidence is unchallenged."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/latey.html Re B &amp; G (Minors)] [1985]'' Family Law Reports 134 and 493. Retrieved 2009-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's military service has subsequently been covered in detail by the British writers [[Russell Miller]] (''[[Bare-faced Messiah]]'', 1987) and Jon Atack (''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'', 1990), by the ''Los Angeles Times'' in a six-part special report on Scientology published in June 1990,&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24" /&gt; and by [[Lawrence Wright]] in ''The New Yorker'' in February 2011 and his book ''[[Going Clear (book)|Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief]]'' (2013).&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt; The accuracy of Miller's account has been questioned; [[:de:Marco Frenschkowski|Marco Frenschkowski]], writing in 1999, commented that Miller's book had "definitely exposed some inflated statements about Hubbard's early achievements" but had also been partly disproved by the Church of Scientology, though he did not state which elements had been disproved.&lt;ref name="Frensch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frenschkowski|first=Marco |date=July 1999|title=L.

==Naval career of Harry Ross Hubbard==
L. Ron Hubbard's father, Lieutenant Commander Harry Ross Hubbard (1886-1975), was a United States Navy Supply Corps officer who served for over 30 years.  His career included service during both world wars.

He first enlisted in the Navy on September 1, 1904 and served until October 31, 1908.  He then re-enlisted during [[World War I]] on October 10, 1917 and was commissioned an assistant paymaster (with the rank of ensign) in the Supply Corps on October 16, 1918.  He was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on November 11, 1919.  He was released from active duty on June 28, 1920 and was placed in an inactive status in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]].

He was commissioned in the Regular Navy and returned to active duty on September 17, 1921.  He was promoted to lieutenant in 1922 and lieutenant commander in 1934.  Although most Navy officers were promoted rapidly during World War II, Hubbard remained a lieutenant commander for the remainder of his career.

Hubbard's career included a number of routine assignments including: assistant paymaster for the submarine tender [[USS Rainbow|USS ''Rainbow'']] in 1918; supply officer for the aircraft tender [[USS Aroostook (CM-3)|USS ''Aroostook'']] (1919-1920) (during Hubbard's assignment to ''Aroostook'' she provided support to the historic [[NC-4]] transatlantic flight); assistant supply officer for the battleship [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|USS ''Oklahoma'']] (1921-1923); under instruction at the School of Application of the Bureau of Supply and Accounts in Washington, D.C. (1923-1924); disbursing officer at the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] (1924-1927); officer in charge of the commissary at Naval Station [[Guam]] (1927-1929); disbursing officer Naval Hospital, Washington, D.C. (1927-1929); assistant supply officer, Puget Sound Navy Yard (1935-1938); and supply officer of the cruiser [[USS Astoria (CA-34)|USS ''Astoria'']] (1938-1941).

During World War II, Hubbard served officer in charge of the commissary at [[Mare Island Navy Yard]] (1941-1943); supply officer for the destroyer tender [[USS Black Hawk (AD-9)|USS ''Black Hawk'' (AD-9)]] (1943–45); and supply officer of Naval Station, Seattle, Washington (1945-1946), after which he retired.&lt;ref name="lermanet.com"&gt;http://www.lermanet.com/shannon/35.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hubbard was assigned to the destroyer tender ''Black Hawk'' during the last two years of the war, the ship was stationed at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Adak, Alaska]].  This was Hubbard's only service outside the continental United States during the war.

Commander Hubbard remained on active duty until he retired from the Navy in May 1946 at the age of 59, after a total of 32 years and 9 months of service.

'''Mu waves''', also known as '''mu rhythms''', comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or [[sensorimotor rhythm]]s, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of [[neuron]]s, probably of the [[Pyramidal cell|pyramidal]] type, in the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement.&lt;ref name=Amzica /&gt; These patterns as measured by [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), or [[electrocorticography]] (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) [[Hertz|Hz]], and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest.&lt;ref name=Amzica&gt;{{cite book|title=Niedermeyer's Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-7817-8942-4|pages=33–63|author=Amzica, Florin|edition=6th|author2=Fernando Lopes da Silva|editor=Schomer, Donald L. |editor2=Fernando Lopes da Silva|chapter=Celluluar Substrates of Brain Rhythms}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[alpha wave]], which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting [[visual cortex]] at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the [[motor cortex]], in a band approximately from ear to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called [[wikt:desynchronization|desynchronization]] of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics. Researchers such as [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|V. S.

==Mirror neurons==

The [[mirror neuron system]] consists of a class of [[neuron]]s that was first studied in the 1990s in [[macaque monkey]]s.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Justin H.G.|author2=Waiter, Gordon D. |author3=Gilchrist, Anne |author4=Perrett, David I. |author5=Murray, Alison D. |author6= Whiten, Andrew |title=Neural mechanisms of imitation and 'mirror neuron' functioning in autistic spectrum disorder|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=1 January 2006|volume=44|issue=4|pages=610–621|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.06.010|pmid=16140346|url=http://culture.st-and.ac.uk/whiten/docs/NeuralMechanisms.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have found sets of neurons that fire when these monkeys perform simple tasks and also when the monkeys view others performing the same simple tasks.&lt;ref name="di Pellegrino"&gt;{{cite journal|last=di Pellegrino|first=G.|author2=Fadiga, L. |author3=Fogassi, L. |author4=Gallese, F. |author5= Rizzolatti, G. |title=Understanding motor events: A neurophysiological study |journal=Experimental Brain Research |year=1992 |volume=91 |issue=1|pages=176–180 |pmid=1301372 |doi= 10.1007/bf00230027}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests they play a role in mapping others' movements into the brain without actually physically performing the movements. These sets of neurons are called mirror neurons and together make up the mirror neuron system. Mu waves are suppressed when these neurons fire, a phenomenon which allows researchers to study mirror neuron activity in humans.&lt;ref name=Rizzolatti&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rizzolatti|first=G|author2=Fogassi, L |author3=Gallese, V |title=Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the understanding and imitation of action|journal=Nature Reviews.

==Development==

A fruitful conceptualization of mu waves in pediatric use is that mu wave ''suppression'' is a representation of activity going on in the world, and is detectable in the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal]] networks.&lt;ref name=Pineda3 /&gt; A resting oscillation becomes suppressed during the observation of sensory information such as sounds or sights, usually within the [[wikt:frontoparietal|frontoparietal]] (motor) cortical region.&lt;ref name=Pineda3 /&gt; The mu wave is detectable during infancy as early as four to six months, when the peak frequency the wave reaches can be as low as 5.4 [[Hertz|Hz]].&lt;ref name=Nystrom /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berchicci /&gt; There is a rapid increase in peak frequency in the first year of life,&lt;ref name=Berchicci&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berchicci|first=M.|author2=Zhang, T. |author3=Romero, L. |author4=Peters, A. |author5=Annett, R. |author6=Teuscher, U. |author7=Bertollo, M. |author8=Okada, Y. |author9=Stephen, J. |author10= Comani, S. |title=Development of Mu Rhythm in Infants and Preschool Children|journal=Developmental Neuroscience|date=21 July 2011|volume=33|issue=2|pages=130–143|doi=10.1159/000329095|pmid=21778699|pmc=3221274}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by age two frequency typically reaches 7.5&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=Marshall /&gt; The peak frequency of the mu wave increases with age until maturation into adulthood, when it reaches its final and stable frequency of 8–13&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=Nystrom /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marshall /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berchicci /&gt; These varying frequencies are measured as activity around the [[central sulcus]], within the Rolandic cortex.&lt;ref name=Pineda3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pineda|first=Jaime A.|title=The functional significance of mu rhythms: Translating "seeing" and "hearing" into "doing" |journal=Brain Research Reviews |date=1 December 2005 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=57–68 |doi= 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2005.04.005|pmid=15925412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mu waves are thought to be indicative of an infant’s developing ability to [[imitate]]. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital role in the development of [[motor skill]]s, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction.&lt;ref name=Marshall /&gt; Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues.&lt;ref name=Nystrom /&gt; Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults.&lt;ref name=Nystrom /&gt; This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life.&lt;ref name=Berchicci /&gt; Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for [[language development]]. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.&lt;ref name=Meltzoff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzoff|first=A. N. |author2=Kuhl, P. K. |author3=Movellan, J. |author4= Sejnowski, T. J. |title=Foundations for a New Science of Learning |journal=Science |date=17 July 2009 |volume=325 |issue=5938 |pages=284–288 |doi=10.1126/science.1175626 |pmid=19608908

===Autism===
[[Autism]] is a disorder that is associated with social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself.&lt;ref name="Bernier"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oberman2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oberman |first=L.M. |author2=Pineda, J. A. |author3=Ramachandran, V.S. |title=The human mirror neuron system: A link between action observation and social skills |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |year=2006 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=62–66 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsl022 |pmc=2555434 |pmid=18985120}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding has led some scientists, notably [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|V. S. Ramachandran]] and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' [[intention]]s and [[goal]]s due to problems with the mirror neuron system.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt; This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching [[Cognitive deficit|cognitive]] and [[Social skills|social]] deficits.&lt;ref name=Oberman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernier /&gt;

Based on findings correlating mirror neuron activity and mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals,&lt;ref name=Pineda2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pineda |first=J.A. |author2=Juavinett, A. |author3=Datko, M. |title=Self-regulation of brain oscillations as a treatment for aberrant brain connections in children with autism |journal=Medical Hypotheses |date=December 2012  |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=790–798 |doi= 10.1016/j.mehy.2012.08.031 |pmid=22999736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; studies have examined both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that [[fMRI]] activation magnitudes in the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better [[social functioning]].&lt;ref name=Bastiaansen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bastiaansen |first=JA |author2=Thioux, M; Nanetti, L; van der Gaag, C; Ketelaars, C; Minderaa, R; Keysers, C |title=Age-related increase in inferior frontal gyrus activity and social functioning in autism spectrum disorder |journal= Biological Psychiatry |date=May 1, 2011 |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=832–838 |pmid=21310395 |doi= 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus is one of the main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism.&lt;ref name=Keuken&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keuken |first=M.C. |author2= Hardie, A.; Dorn, B.

This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain.&lt;ref name=Pineda3 /&gt; Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using [[neurofeedback]] (a type of [[biofeedback]] given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.&lt;ref name=Holtmann&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holtmann |first=Martin |author2=Steiner, Sabina |author3=Hohmann, Sarah |author4=Poustka, Luise |author5= Banaschewski, Tobias |author6= Bölte, Sven |title=Neurofeedback in autism spectrum disorders |journal=Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology |date=November 2011 |origyear=14 July 2011 |volume=53 |issue=11 |pages=986–993 |doi= 10.1111/j.1469-8749.2011.04043.x |pmid=21752020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coben&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coben |first=Robert |author2=Linden, Michael |author3=Myers, Thomas E. |title=Neurofeedback for Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Review of the Literature |journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback |origyear=24 Oct 2009 |date=March 2010|volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=83–105 |doi= 10.1007/s10484-009-9117-y |pmid=19856096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain-computer interfaces==

[[Brain-computer interface]]s (BCIs) are a developing technology that clinicians hope will one day bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled. Those the technology has the potential to help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with [[tetraplegia]] (quadriplegia) or advanced [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, [[neuroprostheses]], or robotic grasping tools.&lt;ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Machado&gt;{{cite journal |last=Machado |first=S |author2= Araújo, F; Paes, F; Velasques, B; Cunha, M; Budde, H; Basile, LF; Anghinah, R; Arias-Carrión, O; Cagy, M; Piedade, R; de Graaf, TA; Sack, AT; Ribeiro, P |title=EEG-based brain-computer interfaces: an overview of basic concepts and clinical applications in neurorehabilitation |journal=Reviews in the neurosciences |year=2010 |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=451–68 |pmid=21438193 |doi= 10.1515/REVNEURO.2010.21.6.451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level.&lt;ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfurtscheller2&gt;{{cite book |title=Brain-Computer Interfaces: Principles and Practice |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780195388855 |pages=227–240 |author= Pfurtscheller, Gert |author2=McFarland, Dennis J. |editor=Wolpaw, Jonathan R. |editor2=Wolpaw, Elizabeth Winter |chapter=BCIs that use sensorimotor rhythms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leuthardt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leuthardt|first=Eric C.|author2=Schalk, Gerwin |author3=Roland, Jarod |author4=Rouse, Adam |author5= Moran, Daniel W. |title=Evolution of brain-computer interfaces: going beyond classic motor physiology|journal=Neurosurgical Focus|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=E4|doi=10.3171/2009.4.FOCUS0979|pmc=2920041|pmid=19569892}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer.&lt;ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /&gt; This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other.

==History==

Mu waves have been studied since the 1930s, and are referred to as the wicket rhythm because the rounded EEG waves resemble [[Croquet|croquet wickets]]. In 1950, [[Henri Gastaut]] and his coworkers reported desynchronization of these waves not only during active movements of their subjects, but also while the subjects observed actions executed by someone else.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; These results were later confirmed by additional research groups,&lt;ref name="The blocking of the Rolandic wicket rhythm and some central changes related to movement"&gt;{{Cite journal

The ''Munay-Ki'' are a series of nine [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|Empowerment]] [[rites]] based on the initiatory practices of the [[Q'ero]] shamans of Peru, as taught by anthropologist [[Alberto Villoldo]].&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;''Williams, J.E.. The Andean Codex: Adventures and Initiations among the Peruvian Shamans'' (softcover); {{ISBN|978-1-571-74304-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Munay" in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] means "love and will", together with "ki", from the Chinese word for energy, combine to give the meaning: energy of love.&lt;ref name="WQE"&gt;''Parker, Phillip.  Websters Quechua-English Thesaurus Dictionary'' (softcover); {{ISBN|978-0-497-83675-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Munay-Ki is a modern form of transmitting the initiation empowerments of the Q'ero, and are based on the traditional initiation ceremonies of Q'ero shamans.&lt;ref name="Ill"&gt;''Villoldo, Alberto.  Illumination: The Shaman's Way of Healing'' (softcover); {{ISBN|978-1-401-92329-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four Q'ero shamans have come to the United States several times to personally transmit the rites in the past six years, and many initiates have gone to Peru to receive the rites there. These shamans are held in high esteem by the members and trainees of The Four Winds Society.&lt;ref name="EXP"&gt; The Four Winds Society {{cite web |url=http://www.thefourwinds.com/expeditions |title=Expeditions and Retreats |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Villoldo learned and studied the rites of the [[Inca civilization|Inca]] [[Shamanism|Shamans]] with a number of mentors over a period of years living with them in the [[Andes]] Mountains of Peru.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;[http://www.munay-ki.org/Munay-Ki_The_Source_of_the_Rites.html Munay-Ki.org - Source of the Rites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225233947/http://www.munay-ki.org/Munay-Ki_The_Source_of_the_Rites.html |date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As he describes in his book Shaman Healer Sage,&lt;ref name="SHS"&gt;''Villoldo, Alberto.  Shaman, Healer, Sage: How to Heal Yourself and Others with the Energy Medicine of the Americas'' (hardcover); {{ISBN|978-0-609-60544-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; he traveled for more than ten years with his first mentor Don Antonio Morales throughout the Andes and the Amazon to accumulate and distill the shamanic knowledge of these peoples. From this distilled knowledge of traditional shamanism, Dr. Villoldo gathered and assembled the Munay-Ki as a series of rites to initiate and empower students in their study and practice of shamanic healing.&lt;ref name="origin" /&gt;  Some of the Munay-Ki rites are direct inclusions of traditional Q'ero initiatory rites: for example the Munay-Ki Day Keeper and Wisdom Keeper rites respectively are anglicized names for the Pampa Mesayok and Alto Mesayok karpay of the Q'ero.&lt;ref name="MLE"&gt;''Wilcox, Joan. Masters of the Living Energy: The Mystical World of the Q'ero of Peru'' (softcover); {{ISBN|978-1-594-77012-8}} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="video"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-5KIhLDWIQ |title= Pampa Mesayok Transmission |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=YouTube |publisher= |accessdate=7 December 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Villoldo writes that the rites derive from the great [[initiation]]s from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] that were brought to the Americas by the first [[Medicine Man|medicine men and women]] who crossed the [[Bering Strait]] from [[Siberia]] during the [[glacial period]] some 30,000 years ago, and who were known as the Laika, the Earthkeepers of old. &lt;ref name="munay"&gt;[http://www.munay-ki.org/Munay-Ki_The_Heros_Journey.html Munay-ki.org - The Heroes Journey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124055618/http://munay-ki.org/Munay-Ki_The_Heros_Journey.html |date=2009-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Munay-Ki rites are initiations intended to help the person receiving them to become a person of wisdom and power.&lt;ref name="munay" /&gt; Like the Q'ero initiations they include, the Munay-Ki are given at the beginning of one's shamanic training in order to guide the student successfully through their studies and development into a healer. &lt;ref name="Ill" /&gt; &lt;ref name="WBW"&gt;''Kinch, Denise.  Walk Between Worlds, Truth is Beauty, the Q'ero'' (softcover); {{ISBN|978-1-4415-3382-1}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The authenticity of these rites are disputed however, and some argue that they are totally fabricated and have no relationship with the Q'ero nation. Critics argue that Dr. Villoldo has exploited the Q'ero nation with his teachings in order to make money. His Four Winds Society has become very popular in the United States, but is not without controversy. Some indigenous groups see this as a prime example of cultural appropriation, while followers believe that Dr. Villoldo was given permission by his teachers to share the teachings. This is a prime example of neoshamanism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">'''Myles McSweeney''' (1814-1881) was an Irish [[Chartism|Chartist]], mythologist and [[Secularism|secularist]] writer.

McSweeney was born in [[Northern Ireland]] but moved to London. He was influenced by the views of [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Robert Taylor]] and wrote for the [[National Reformer]] and ''Secular Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Mazzini Wheeler|Wheeler, Joseph Mazzini]]. (1889). ''A Biographical Dictionary of Freethinkers of All Ages and Nations''. London: Progressive Publishing Company. p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a former [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] who became anti-Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Shipley, Stan. (1983). ''Club Life and Socialism in Mid-Victorian London''. Journeyman. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Steven Fielding (political historian)|Steven Fielding]] has described McSweeney as a "leading secularist lecturer in London's proletarian clubland."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Fielding (political historian)|Feilding, Steven]]. (1993). ''Class and Ethnicity: Irish Catholics in England, 1880-1939''. Open University Press. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

McSweeney was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]] and lectured on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Maurice Davies|Davies, Charles Maurice]]. (1874). [https://archive.org/stream/heterodoxlondono01daviiala#page/111/mode/2up ''Heterodox London: Or, Phases of Free Thought in the Metropolis'']. London: Tinsley Brothers. pp. 111-120&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for having reduced "Christ to a Solar Myth".&lt;ref&gt;Shipley, Stan. (1983). ''Club Life and Socialism in Mid-Victorian London''. Journeyman. p. 37. "Myles McSweeney was an old Chartist who could reduce 'Christ to a Solar Myth' in a 'quaint style' which club members knew and loved. When he died in 1881 subscriptions for his funeral were sent in from all over London."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s he associated with [[Charles Bradlaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David James O'Donoghue|O'Donoghue, David James]]. (1912). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029566530#page/n305/mode/2up ''The Poets of Ireland: A Biographical and Bibliographical Dictionary of Irish Writers of English Verse''].

The '''Pakistan National Congress''' (PNC), later known as the '''Bangladesh National Congress''',  was a political party that mainly represented the [[Hindu]]s and other religious minorities in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite book|title=Major governments of Asia|author=George McTurnan Kahin, Harold C. Hinton|publisher=[[Cornell University]] Press|pages=439|year=1958|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite book|title=Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations: Asia and Australasia|author=Moshe Y. Sachs|publisher=Worldmark Press|pages=|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party championed [[secularism]] in the Muslim-dominated state, and its electoral and organisational strength was mainly based in [[East Bengal]] (also known as [[East Pakistan]], now the independent state of [[Bangladesh]]).&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{cite book|title=War and Secession: Pakistan, India and the Creation of Bangladesh|author=Richard Sisson, Leo E. Rose|publisher=University of California Press|pages=1–15|year=1991|isbn=978-0-520-07665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Pakistan National Congress traces its roots to the [[Indian National Congress]], which was the largest national political party in India.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; The Indian National Congress, led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] championed secularism, religious tolerance and opposed the [[Pakistan movement]] led by the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. However, ensuing communal conflict led to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan from Muslim-majority provinces. The religious violence and mass migration as a result of partition significantly reduced the Hindu, Sikh and non-Muslim population of Pakistan. The leaders and activists of the Indian National Congress who continued to live in Pakistan joined with the representatives of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Christian communities to form a new political party, the Pakistan National Congress.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; Although most of them had opposed partition, the members of the new party accepted the state of Pakistan and did not maintain any organisational links with the Indian National Congress.

==Positions==
The Pakistan National Congress stood for secularism, equality of all religions and citizens and protection of religious and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; The party sought peaceful and friendly relations between Pakistan and India. The party was one of many that opposed the suppression of democracy and civil rights by successive military regimes. The Pakistan National Congress also stood against the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistani society, politics and government. The party also supported the [[Bengali language movement]] in East Bengal.

===Bengali Language Movement===
{{main|Role of political parties during Bengali Language Movement}}
National Congress was the only party at the opposition side of the house during the movement. In both Legislative Assembly and in [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan|Constituent Assembly]] they exposed of the logical position of the language demand. In doing so some of the members were called Indian agents and were harassed by the government. Some leaders were also arrested and one of them was killed inside the jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Umar|1979|p=617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral Performance==
While partition riots and mass migration had significantly reduced the Hindu and Sikh population in West Pakistan, Hindus still constituted twenty percent of the population of East Bengal (also East Pakistan).&lt;ref name="C"/&gt; Consequently, the PNC's base and organisation were concentrated in that province of Pakistan. In the [[East Bengali legislative election, 1954|1954 elections]] held for the East Bengal Legislative Assembly, the Pakistan National Congress won 28 seats.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;

==Bangladesh==
After the [[Bangladeshi War of Independence]], the party briefly survived as the Bangladesh National Congress ({{lang-bn|বাংলাদেশ জাতীয় কংগ্রেস}} ''Bangladesh Jatiya Congress'').&lt;ref&gt;February 25, 1975, [[The Daily Ittefaq]] on Tuesday&lt;/ref&gt; The party stood one candidate, Sree Peter Paul Gomez in the [[Bangladeshi general election, 1973|1973 election]] for Dacca-25,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecs.gov.bd/English/PrintElection.php?&amp;electionid=1&amp;party=13&amp;PartyName=Bagladesh%20Jatiya%20Congress&amp;id=partywise&lt;/ref&gt; but did not win the seat.  The party was dissolved in 1975 after the formation of the [[Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League]] as the sole political party of Bangladesh.  It is unknown how long the party survived in [[West Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.sachalayatan.com/statuses/615&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7556">The '''Nayak'''  is a [[Suryavanshi Rajput]]&lt;ref&gt;''People of India'', Volume II, edited by K.S Singh. P.964&lt;/ref&gt; clan found in the state of [[Rajasthan]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Orisa]], [[Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]] in India. The word Nayak means a head of a regiment. This word is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] Sena Nayak, which means "head of a regiment". The Nayak traces their origin back to [[Suryavani Rajput]].&lt;ref name="poi"&gt;''People of India'', Volume II, edited by K.S Singh.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nayak is not same or similar to Naik or Nayaka castes. Nayak is separate from Naik or Nayaka castes.
==History and origin==
Nayak word is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word Sena Nayak, which means the leader or head of a regiment. The Nayak trace their origin back to [[Suryavanshi Rajputs]] or [[Rajanya Kayasthas]]. They claim that they used to hold the rank of Nayak in Royal Forces. They were highly regarded for their bravery, in due course they became a powerful group and occupied several forts and jagirs. In fear of their growing power the rulers tried to defame them in various ways. Then Nayak withdrew themselves from the association of the [[Suryavanshi Rajputs]] or [[Rajanya Kayasthas]] and came out as a separate community. It is said that when [[Parashuram]] the great mythical character was killing the [[Kshatriyas]] then the Nayak had to conceal their Kshatriya identity. Rajanya is the real word for kshatriyas according to Rig-Veda Purush Sukta. They have several other legends in which they trace their ancestry back to the mythical characters of lnchhbasu. One of the five sons of [[Surya]] to one of the wives of [[Brihaspati]] who was impregnated by [[Chandrama]] to Sangnya, One of the three wives of Surya. They recall their origin at Jatala village whence they migrated to [[Jaisalmer]] and hence to the various other parts. They are distributed in the districts of [[Sri Ganganagar]], [[Churu]], [[Sikar]], [[Nagaur]], [[Jhunjhunu]] etc. Their spoken language is [[Marwari language|Marwari]]. They are conversant with [[Hindi]], Script used is [[Devnagari]]. The Nayak have the two divisions of nakh and dudh (clan). There are altogether sixteen nakhs namely Panwar, Solanki, Chauhan, Chalukya, Bhati, Tanwar, Rang-ghad, Bagla, Chandela, Dhol, Sodath, Khinchi, Ran, Gor, Galhot and Rathore.
Each of the nakh has a number of dudh in it. Bhati have nine dudh. Panwar have seven. Tanwar includes eight. Rathore have nine dudhs. Dudh are namely Malkhot, Potwana, Dhulkia, Kayat, Bokra, Dagla, Sudia, Chanwaria, Chandalia, Boyat, Rojh, Ghoran, Barwasa, Banyal, Goglia, Chaaran, Saarsar, Gagrhia, Arhia etc. Concept of hierarchy is not associated with these divisions. In the traditional varna order they are ranked as Kshatriya.
Community endogamy and nakh and dudh exogamy are the rule. Junior levirate is allowed. Child marriage has been replaced by post-puberty marriage. Selection of match is ﬁnalised with the performance sagai (betrothal). Marriage is solemnized at bride's place. The bride and the groom take phera (circulations of sacred ﬁre). Garuda Brahman performs the job of priest. A feast is arranged by the bride's parents. The consummation of marriage is held at groom's house. Monogamy is the prevalent practice. Polygamy is permissible in case of barrenness of the wife. Bora (toe ring), aonla and pajeb (silver anklet) are the marriage symbols for women. Bride price is paid in cash and in kind. Post-marital residence is patrilocal. Divorce is permitted. Either the spouses can initiate its proceedings. Remarriage is allowed for widow, widower and divorcee. Remarriage of a woman is called nata consisting of only a bief formality. However in case a widower is marrying an unmarried girl than the marriage is solemnised with phera and in detail.
The prevalent type of family is extended type followed by nuclear family. The male member holds the authority and decision-making power. In a family the relation between father-in-law and daughter-in-law and that between brother-in-law (husband's elder brother) and sister-in-law (younger brother's wife) is of avoidance. Joking relations exist between elder brother's wife and husband's younger brother and also among elder sister's husband and wife's younger sister. Property is inherited in the male line and male equigeniture is the norm. Authority succeeds from father to the eldest son. Inter-family linkages among the community people are maintained through mutual help and cooperation.

The women in normal circumstances do not go out for earning. Household work and looking after the children is their main responsibility. They participate in social and religious activities but have no role in socio-political organization of the community. They bring potable water, collect ﬁrewood, in family as well as in society women are subordinate to men.
After delivery. sutak (pollution period) is observed for soa-mahina(five weeks) during which the mother and the baby are kept conﬁned in a room. The pollution period for the family members end with suraj pujan. Name of the child is selected on that day. After five weeks jarhula (tonsure) is done in case of male child. 
Among the Nayak dead are cremated. The corpse is taken to the samsan (crematorium) on arthi (wooden bier). The widow of the deceased gives up her marriage symbols on the arthi. The corpse is placed on the pyre with its head to the east. Eldest son acts as chief mourner, who lights the pyre. On the third day unburnt bones and ashes are collected which are disposed of at Haridwar. Sutak (death pollution) is observed for twelve days which ends with kriya (death rites). The funeral feast arranged on this day is attended by kins and caste men. The succession rites are performed for the eldest son in the evening.
The Nayak by religion are Hindu. Pabuji is their main deity. He is believed to be the incarnation of God. They also worship Gogaji, Ramdevji, Shivji, Kalka (Kali) mata, Nagechi Mate, Bheruji, Karni mata etc. They have kula devi (lineage goddess). Besides, Nagechi is their community goddess. They go to pilgrimage to Runecha (Jaisalmer), Gangaji at Haridwar etc. Gauda Brahman acts as sacred specialist in their life cycle rituals. Holi, Deepavali, Rakshabandhan, Gangaur etc. are their major festivals. The community have the oral tradition of songs and tales. During festivals and in marriage women sing folk songs.
The Nayak have traditional linkages with Garuda Brahmans, Dholi, Nai, who offer them priestly and other specialized services. They accept water and cooked food from the all the clean castes and vice versa. But do not accept the same from Sansi, Meghwal, etc. Putative kinship is maintained with whom they have commensal relations. They share water source with other communities in the locality. They have access to schools, temples etc. They use both traditional and modern medicare system. They have favorable attitude towards family planning. Hand pump and tap water are their sources of drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India'', Volume II, edited by K.S Singh.P.964&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oahspe: A New Bible''''' is a book published in 1882, purporting to contain "new revelations" from "...the Embassadors of the angel hosts of heaven prepared and revealed unto man in the name of Jehovih..."&lt;ref&gt;Oahspe Introduction, verse 23&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by an American dentist, John Ballou Newbrough (1828&amp;ndash;1891),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| last = McConnell| first  = Reed| date = Spring 2017| title  = Orphan Utopia| url  = http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/63/mcconnell.php| magazine = Cabinet| location = Brooklyn, NY| publisher  = Immaterial Incorporated| access-date= August 18, 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; who reported it to have been written by [[automatic writing]], making it one of a number of 19th-century [[spiritualist]] works attributed to that practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oah/pamphlet.htm|title=THE ORIGIN OF OAHSPE|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text defines adherents of the disciplines expounded in ''Oahspe'' as "Faithists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oahspestandardedition.com/OSE_01_03.html|title=OAHSPE Standard Edition, start and books 01 02 03|website=oahspestandardedition.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oahspe'' comprises a series of related interior books chronicling earth and its heavenly administrations, as well as setting forth teachings for modern times. Included are over 100 drawings.&lt;ref&gt;The number of drawings in ''Oahspe'' depends upon what constitutes a separate drawing; for example, apart from the 100 or so drawings in the main text, there are 92 entries in the 1882 Glossary that each have drawings that depict its associated entry term.&lt;/ref&gt; The title page of ''Oahspe'' describes its contents with these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A New Bible in the Words of Jehovih and His Angel Ambassadors. A Sacred History of the Dominions of the Higher and Lower Heavens on the Earth for the Past Twenty-Four Thousand Years together with a Synopsis of the Cosmogony of the Universe; the Creation of Planets; the Creation of Man; the Unseen Worlds; the Labor and Glory of Gods and Goddesses in the Etherean Heavens; with the New Commandments of Jehovih to Man of the Present Day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Jehovih", "The Great Spirit", "Ormazd", "Egoquim", "Agoquim", "Eloih", "The I Am", and "Jehovah" are some of the names used throughout Oahspe as the name of the Creator.

According to Oahspe the Creator is both masculine and feminine. Om is one of the names used to refer to the feminine (mother) aspect. Other references include, "The All Person", "The unseen" and "The Everpresent", "The All Light", "The Highest Light". God and Lord are titles of office for a person in the spirit realm who began life as mortal/in corporeal form (spirit within a body). The Creator is all and was all and forever will be all; He/She was never born and is beyond all Gods. The Creator is our father and mother, and all that are and were born are our brothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oahspestandardedition.com/OSE_32.html|title=Book of Judgment; bk 32 of OAHSPE Standard Edition|website=oahspestandardedition.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis and first presentation==
[[File:Tablet of Fonece from Oahspe.jpg|frame|right|The "Tablet of Fonece," an illustration from ''Oahspe'']]
''Oahspe'' (the word is defined as "sky, earth (corpor) and spirit. The all; the sum of corporeal and spiritual knowledge as at present"&lt;ref&gt;[http://oahspestandardedition.com/OSE_40_1d.html 1882 ''Oahspe'' Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;) was published in 1882.

Dr. Newbrough had started writing the book in 1880 and stated that the writing was done automatically; he had been a [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] since the early 1870s. On at least two occasions Newbrough wrote publicly about how the ''Oahspe'' came about through automatic writing. A ''letter'' published in the ''[[Banner of Light]]'' (a 19th-century Spiritualist newspaper), and an ''Addendum'' in the 1882 Edition republished by [[Raymond A. Palmer]] in 1972. Both accounts, written in the first person, indicate that Newbrough sat at a (newly invented) [[typewriter]] for half an hour each morning at which time his hands would automatically type (without his knowledge of what was being written).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oahspestandardedition.com/About_Oahspe/Transmission_of_Oahspe.html About ''Oahspe'']&lt;/ref&gt;) An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' had him explain that, feeling the urge to write, he sat down with pen and paper until a bright light enveloped his fingers and they started writing. Moreover, many of the drawings contain symbols resembling [[hieroglyphs]], presumably drawn.&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt; A copy of the "Banner of Light" letter accompanied Oahspes published by the Kosmon Press in England (such as it was received in New Zealand in 1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The first presentation of the book took place on 20 October 1882 in Newbrough's house, at 128 West 34th Street in New York City, where he presented the "new bible," "a large quarto volume of over 900 pages," to a group of people. According to the New York Times news article, Newbrough said that the book was not a sacred text ''per se'', but rather a history of religions going back 24,000 years, and that the first publication of the book came about with the financial assistance of a number of unnamed contributors.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{Cite news

===Style and language===
The first (1882 edition) publication, as it was originally presented in 1882, contained various glyphs, whose resemblance to real Egyptian hieroglyphs was attested to by Prof. Thomas A.M. Ward, who claimed to have deciphered the hieroglyphics on the [[Cleopatra's Needle (New York)|Cleopatra's Needle]] obelisk in [[Central Park]]. Ward was present at ''Oahspe''{{'}}s first presentation, as was Dr. Cetliniski, an Oriental scholar, who affirmed that mere mortals could not have produced such a book and that "supernatural agents" must have been responsible.&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;

The first reporter on the book, writing for ''The New York Times'', compared the book's content to a revised fusion of Indian and Semitic religions, and said its style was "in one place modern, and in another ancient, and the English of the King James version of the Christian Bible is mixed in with the English of today's."&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;

== Basic teachings ==
''Oahspe'' emphasized service to others; each person is graded according to service to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oahspestandardedition.com/OSE_32.html|title=Book of Judgment; bk 32 of OAHSPE Standard Edition|website=oahspestandardedition.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual, group and nation is either in ascension or descension; sooner or later, all ascend, rising in grade. The higher one's grade, the better are the conditions within one's own soul, and the better the place awaiting one in heaven.

According to ''Oahspe'', when mortals die their spirits continue to live, regardless of who they worshiped, or even whether they disbelieved in an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oahspestandardedition.com/OSE_21a.html|title=Book of God's Word, chs 1-11; bk 21 of OAHSPE Standard Edition|website=oahspestandardedition.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit realm becomes their new home, which is called heaven, and the individual spirit is called an angel. There are unorganized heavens close to or on the earth. Also starting there - and linking to the highest heavens - are the organized heavens. Both types of heavens are accessible to mortals. If a portion of heaven lives in a state of chaos and delights in evil, that portion is called hell.

An angel must subsist for a season after death somewhere along a continuum of delightful to abysmally wretched conditions. The heavenly place where angels initially live is determined by what their habits were as mortals; as well as by their aspirations and diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oahspestandardedition.com/OSE_04b.html|title=Book of Jehovih chs 3, 4 &amp; 5; bk 04 of OAHSPE Standard Edition|website=oahspestandardedition.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selfish behavior, low thoughts, or eating animal derived food will place a newborn angel in the lowest level, being on the earth. Evil oriented persons enter heaven into hellish conditions. Nevertheless, all in descension eventually turn around and ascend upward to more delightful places within an organized heaven, whose chief is called God. God is an advanced angel ordained into office for a season.

The morphologically plural name [[Elohim]], often translated as god-singular in the Old Testament, is not used to mean the Creator throughout the main body of ''Oahspe''; the singular Hebrew terms "Jehovih" (SHD 3069) and "Eloih" are used instead.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Arrangement ==
According to ''Oahspe'', the history of humankind is marked by a series of progressions. These lessons come in cycles: advancement followed by recession, being in turn succeeded by other cycles of improvement and regression. Cycles exist within cycles, but one important cycle, used in improving the grade of humanity, is a 3000-year cycle (average), and it is this cycle around which the books in Oahspe are organized.

The first few books of ''Oahspe'' lay the groundwork for understanding the nature of the work. This merges into a concise history taking the reader up to the present time, the new era. Separate from the history books are a series of books intended to illume for the reader the requirements of humanity for this day and age.

An interesting graphological characteristic of Oahspe is that a number of its sub-books are printed on pages divided in two. In these, the top half of the page contains a narrative of celestial events, while the bottom half describes the corresponding events on Earth.

==Synopsis==

=== Doctrines ===
''Oahspe'' includes doctrinal books, and precepts for behavior can be found throughout its many books. Freedom and responsibility are two themes reiterated throughout the text of ''Oahspe''. Some core doctrines include an [[herbivorous]] diet ([[vegan]], vegetable food only), peaceful living (no warring or violence; [[pacifism]]), living a life of [[virtue]], service to others, angelic assistance, spiritual communion, and communal living, (the smallest collective unit being ten families, the largest being a total of 3,000 persons then dividing to create a new community).

===Subjects===

==== Ethics ====
''Oahspe'' exhibits great interest in understanding and applying general [[ethics|ethical]] principles. The suffix [[wikt:-ism|ISM]] in Faith-ism is defined meaning adherence or following an ideology. The [[Book of Inspiration]] in the Oahspe states "I will have no ''sect''. I will have no ''creed''".

==== Religion ====
''Oahspe'' speaks of the need for all religions to help the various nations and peoples to rise upward. It also speaks of what it calls "the religion of Gods themselves,"&lt;ref&gt;Book of Discipline 7:15&lt;/ref&gt; in which its adherents have no need for intermediaries such as are Saviors and Idols, but who commune directly with the Creator of all.

==== History ====
''Oahspe'' purports to describe events in the spirit realms and their corresponding influence on events in the physical world starting from approximately 72,000 years ago, although many of such events are not recorded in the existing human records. The Book of Eskra and the Book of Es, according to Oahspe, are the more recent historical records (as they were recorded in the spirit realms) from 1550 BCE to the time Oahspe was transcribed in 1880 CE. The Book of God's Word teaches the record of [[Zarathustra]] and dates his time on earth at 9000 years ago.

===== Geology and archeology =====
''Oahspe'' gives details, including maps, about [[lost lands]] and new lands, particularly a large sunken continent called Pan or Whaga that once filled much of the Pacific Ocean. It also puts forward explanations on the causes of rapid loss or gain of fertility, the cyclical variations in heat and light upon the earth.

===== Language and linguistics =====
''Oahspe'' presents many illustrations of symbols said to be of ancient languages and of rites and ceremonies. It states the concept that there was an original language called ''Pan'' or the ''Panic Language'', meaning "Earth Language," which originated from the ability of humans to mimic sounds. Its ''Book of Saphah'' has details on the claimed meanings and roots of many of the ancient words, symbols and ceremonies.

===== Evolution or progress =====
''Oahspe'' contains chronologically-ordered accounts that are [[esoteric cosmology|cosmological]] [[revelation]]s concerning the development of [[human]]ity from approximately 78,000 years ago. This also includes a narrative of the genesis of life on earth, from its start as a planet being formed from its beginnings as a comet gathering material as its vortex (subtle envelope) matures till it is placed into its own stable orbit around its sun. After cooling - the transformation of gases and its first life-forms - and finally to the appearance of the human race and its progression from beast to physical and spiritual maturity. The process, according to Oahspe, has reached its last stage with the emergence of the "herbivorous men and women of peace" of this ''Kosmon'' era.

==== System and order ====

===== Cosmogony =====
''Oahspe'' explains physical science as having its basis in subtler realms (which include spiritual forces), and then how to predict from them. ''Oahspe'' devotes an entire interior book to the subject, called the ''Book of Cosmogony and Prophecy'', but a general overview can be read in the ''Book of Jehovih''. Also, many examples and edifications are sprinkled throughout ''Oahspe''. Other related subjects include physics and an integrating treatment of gravity, light, electricity, magnetism, heat, weather phenomenon, subtle planetary envelopes (called vortices) that respond to conditions beyond its boundaries and more.

Vortex Motion of Planets was originally proposed by philosopher and mathematician, Rene Descartes (1596-1650), and was not a new scientific theory as Oahspe claims. Unfortunately for Rene Descartes and Oahspe, Vortex Motions of Planets, originally proposed by Rene Descartes, was superseded by the scientific work of [[Isaac Newton]], 1642 – 1726.

===== Cycles =====
The text describes cyclical events that occur within a range of greater and smaller cycles. For instance, according to ''Oahspe'', the earth is traveling with the sun and its planets through regions of space in a large circuit of 4,700,000 years, which is divided into sections of 3,000 years average, which also occur within larger cycles of 24,000 years and 72,000 years, and so on. Each of these regions has variations in density and other qualities, and so, engender varying conditions that the Earth encounters. Also, explanation is given as to the rise and fall of civilizations.

===== Administration =====
The various regions mentioned in the previous ''Cycles'' section are under the administration of spiritual or "etherean" beings with titles such as "God" and "Chief" and whose ranks and ages vary in ascending grade, from tens of thousands of years to hundreds of thousands of years old and older. Their dominions cover vast distances and include many spiritual and corporeal worlds of various grades and densities.

These chief officers are designated "Sons and Daughters of Jehovih," and in accordance, the text of ''Oahspe'' contains separate sections or "books"  such as the ''Book of Cpenta-Armij, Daughter of Jehovih'', and also includes familiar names from non-[[Abrahamic religions]], as in the ''Book of Apollo'' and ''Book of Thor'', named as Sons of Jehovih.

Each of these Chiefs, Chieftainesses, Gods and Goddesses are only advanced angels according to ''Oahspe''. And every angel, regardless of rank or office, was once a mortal, either from this planet earth or from some other planet in the universe.

==Faithism==
Soon after its publication, a number of groups/lodges formed in response to ''Oahspe''. In New York City, the Oahspe Faithists met as early as 1883 in the Utah Hall (25th Street and 8th Avenue) with members only attending services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

It was from the Pearl River location that Newbrough and a number of Faithists and orphaned children went to Las Cruces, New Mexico, where they founded the Shalam Colony in 1884. The Shalam Colony continued to exist for more than 10 years, although Newbrough died in 1891 during a severe influenza epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131002132334/http://archives.nmsu.edu/exhibits/shalam/ Shalam Colony: A Utopian Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary Faithist group is the [[Universal Faithists of Kosmon]] (Colorado and California), whose teachings include the virtue of unified group efforts to achieve good works. They have also published a 1991 edition of Oahspe.

In the United States of America other existing Faithist organizations include:
* the Restoration Faithists (of the New York area).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* The Eloists (headquartered in the New England region).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oahspe-eloists.com/ |title=Eloists website |accessdate=July 3, 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428152323/http://www.oahspe-eloists.com/ |archivedate=April 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the United States:
* The Kosmon Church, in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmonchurch.org.uk/index.html Kosmon Church website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301202712/http://www.kosmonchurch.org.uk/index.html |date=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Oahspe Stichting, in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediumschap.com/Stichting%20Oahspe.php|title=Oahspe Stichting website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past Faithist organizations include:
* the Societas Frateria, a fruitarian Oahspe group, c. 1895, in Placentia, California, where 2 children were starved to death. The first a one year old baby, that was starved to death after being fed a diet of raw peeled apples. The infant was so ill, it could not even cry. Two cult leaders, George Rinsdale Hinde, and Dr. Louis Schlesinger, were indicted on murder charges in the death. The second death was Alice Hinde, the 18 year old daughter of leader George Rinsdale Hinde. She was not keen on Oahspe, so her fanatical father locked her in her room for two years and fed her bread and water. She died from starvation. George Hinde hid the body of her daughter by burying it in the back yard, out the back door, in an unmarked grave so authorities could not find the body. The Orange County coroner's inquest found that Alice Hinde was starved to death.
* the Brotherhood of Light, c. 1906, Arboles, Colorado; where 12 children starved to death in one year. 6 of those deaths occurred in one month.
* the Universal Light, c. 1970, Anaheim, California, where some 15 different UFO UFO doomsday cults were formed by Oahspe leader Mary Lou Brown, who called herself "Goddess of the Red Star." This group was waiting for a nuclear war and UFO rescue. Some cult members were so brainwashed by Mary Lou Brown's doomsday cult, they had to be rescued by Cult Deprogrammer, Ted Patrick.
* the Brothers of Shalom, c. 1969 - 1980s, Albion, California, was a homosexual Oahspe Bible Doomsday group, consisting of Ray Williams, Robert, and Claude. Known locally, as the Three Wise Men. According to faithist writer and investigator, Arnold Aries, this group was an Oahspe Bible homosexual doomsday cult. This group lived in homemade plastic tents on the side of the mountain outside Albion, California. They had no running water, or sanitary facilities. Former members gave testimony that the group was involved in drugging and raping run away boys as young as 14 years old.
* the Universal Brotherhood, c. 1960 - 1980, Balingup, NW Australia, was a Oahspe Bible / Urantia Book based religious cult group led by Fred and Mary Robinson. This UFO Doomsday cult group was waiting for a UFO rescue, at which time all people in the world who did not accept Oahspe would be taken up on prison UFO Ships and taken to prison planets. Cult leader Fred Robinson was originally thought to be a harmless old kook, until a 2007 Freedom of Information Act request revealed that Fred Robinson was involved in a Rosicruscian Pedofile Priest scandal at a nudist colony where he was an "Ordained Minister." According to the FOIA report released in 2007, Fred Robinson was part of a Rosicrucian Nudist Colony in the early 1950s in Brisbane, Australia, when two men were sentenced to prison for "debauchery," with two boys, age 11 and 14. The Nudist Colony cult leader, "Reverend," William Henry Long, was sentenced to 5 years hard labor in Gaol Prison for ,"debauchery," with an 11 year old and a 14 year old boy he had obtained from a local orphanage. The FOIA report also revealed that Fred Robinson was also trying to procure children from orphanages. Australian Child Protective services refused to give Fred Robinson any children.
* the Universal Brotherhood of Faithists in Tiger, Georgia.
* the Four Winds Village, Tiger, GA, c 1986. This group was founded by Virginia Howard and Ray Schlipman. One day after moving to Four Winds Village in 1986, the body of Ray Schlipman was found on the estate with his skull crushed in. $10,000 in cash was found to be missing from Schlipman's room the same day.
* the Essenes of Kosmon, Utah, led by Wing Anderson, who was recruiting people to come join his cult to escape a coming nuclear war.
* the Essenes of Kosmon (who lived in communities in Colorado around the 1940s and 1950s).
* The Confraternity of Faithists and Kosmon Church in the U.K.

===Land of Shalam===
The Shalam Colony, or Land of Shalam, was formed in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], in 1884, as a commune in which members would live peaceful, vegetarian lifestyles, and where orphaned urban children were to be raised. The commune was decided upon after a convention at Pearl River, New York, in November 1883, and was founded with the financial help of Andrew Howland. Newbrough raised money as well. He charged James Ellis $10,000 to join Shalam, and the next day Ellis demanded his money back. Newbrough refused to return the money. Members spent the first winter in [[adobe]] huts, and in 1885 began building a 42-room central building, the Fraternum. Children were "'gathered-up' from foundling homes; handed over by police sergeants; and left in Faithist depositories". Newbrough and his wife traveled as far as [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[San Francisco]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Chicago]] to gather children. The children, from a variety of races, were pampered and treated with love and kindness.&lt;ref name="fogarty"&gt;{{Cite book

By the time Newbrough died (on 22 April 1891, of [[influenza]]), the colony consisted of the Fraternum, the Children's House (completed in 1890), and a church and other buildings. After the majority of the original volunteers left Shalam in 1886 when the financier, Howland resumed ownership of the property, a second type of colony was built a half a mile away from Shalam; called Levitica, it was founded for people who were not particularly followers of Oahspe teachings but needed a place to live. Levitica was designed in a less communal fashion, and inhabitants lived in more isolated homes.&lt;ref name="fogarty"/&gt; This arrangement also soon failed due to various factors including non-participation.

Apparently, the colony was not a viable financial enterprise, due to the repeated failure of crops, the lack of markets for the crops they did produce, and the frequent flooding of the [[Rio Grande]]; Newbrough's wife, Francis van de Water Sweet, had married Howland in 1893 "to put an end to malicious gossip" but the cost of maintaining the colony proved too high. In 1901, the colony folded, and the children were sent to orphanages in [[Dallas]] and [[Denver]].&lt;ref name="curtis"&gt;{{Cite book

== Editions ==
''Oahspe'' has been published in three editions in the US; all other complete publications are either reprints or minor modifications of these. The first edition was edited and in 1882 published by John Newbrough. The second was also edited by Newbrough but not published until after his death from influenza on April 22, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oahspestandardedition.com/About_Oahspe/John_B_Newbrough.html|title=OAHSPE Standard Edition|first=Seventh Era|last=Faithists|website=oahspestandardedition.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third edition was edited by Wing Anderson in 1912.

=== Publishing chronology ===
The 1882 ''Oahspe'' edition was available until the 1891 edition appeared, except for an apparently 1912 London edition, which combined 1882 body text with 1891 front matter and image captions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oah/oah/index.htm|title=Oahspe index|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, the 1882 edition had not been republished until 1960, after [[Raymond A. Palmer|Ray Palmer]] of Palmer Publications found an 1882 ''Oahspe'' edition, by that time rare. He photocopied it and inserted from the 1891 edition, the [http://oahspestandardedition.com/OSE_33_34.html ''Book of Discipline''], which was not in the 1882 edition; also the 1891 index was adjusted for page numbers and inserted into the 1882 photocopy edition.

The 1891 ''Oahspe'' Edition was published in various printings from 1891 to the present. The 1891 edition has been published by Kosmon Press, United Kingdom, since 1910, but with some British spellings such as colour instead of color. In America, E. Wing Anderson and his group, the Essenes of Kosmon, published the 1891 ''Oahspe'' edition in several printings from the 1935 printing up to the 1955 printing. Other later reprint editions of the 1891 version include [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL400274M/Oahspe ''Oahspe - the angel cover edition''] by David Cardone, published 1998 and the white paperback edition published by the Universal Faithists of Kosmon in 2004.

==Biography of Dr. John Newbrough==
John Ballou Newbrough was born on 5 June 1828 near [[Mohicanville, Ohio]], in a log cabin. His father, William Newbrough, was an Englishman who had attended the [[College of William &amp; Mary]]; his mother, Elizabeth Polsky, was Swiss and attracted to [[spiritualism]]. Their son was named for the [[universalist]] clergyman [[Hosea Ballou]]. Newbrough's father was a stern man, flogging his son when the latter "began to receive spirit messages"; his schooling (he went to high school in [[Cleveland]]) were paid for by his mother and him selling wool and eggs. He graduated from [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati Medical College]], but being highly sensitive to pain and suffering he chose [[dentistry]], setting up practice first in [[Dayton]], then Cincinnati, and then [[New York City]]. He ran into trouble with the [[Goodyear Rubber Company]] after he developed a much cheaper compound to set teeth in dental plates than the one produced by Goodyear, which dominated the market. He was sued for patent infringement, but when the verdict was handed down in his favor, after he had supposedly consulted with spirits who visited him at dawn, he saw that as confirmation of his spiritual future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

{{Saivism}}
The '''Pashupati Seal''' is a [[steatite]] [[Impression seal|seal]] that was discovered at the [[Mohenjo-daro]] archaeological site of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. The seal depicts a seated figure that is possibly [[Three-headed|tricephalic]] (having three heads). It was once thought to be [[ithyphallic]], an interpretation that is now mostly discarded. He has a horned headdress and is surrounded by animals. He may represent a [[horned deity]].

It is purported to be one of the earliest depictions of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] ("[[Pashupati]]", meaning "lord of animals", is one of Shiva's [[Epithet|epithets]]) or [[Rudra]], who is associated with asceticism, [[yoga]], and [[linga]]; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three heads.  The figure has often been connected with the widespread motif of the [[Master of Animals]] found in ancient [[Near East]]ern and Mediterranean art, and the many other traditions of horned deities.&lt;ref&gt;Werness, Hope B., ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in World Art'', p. 270, 2006, A&amp;C Black, {{ISBN|0826419135}}, 9780826419132, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iBSDddO-9PoC&amp;pg=PA270 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay]], who directed the excavations at Mohenjo-daro, and dated the seal to the Intermediate I Period (now considered to fall around 2350-2000 BCE) in his 1937-38 report in which the seal is numbered 420, giving it its alternate name.{{sfn|Mackay|1937-38|loc=plate XCIV; no. 420}}

[[File:Yogi. Mold of Seal, Indus valley civilization.jpg|thumb|An impression made from the steatite seal]]
The seal is formed of [[steatite]] and measures 3.56&amp;nbsp;cm by 3.53&amp;nbsp;cm, with a thickness of 0.76&amp;nbsp;cm. It has a human figure at the center seated on a platform and facing forward. The legs of the figure are bent at the knees with the heels touching and the toes pointing downwards. The arms extend outwards and rest lightly on the knees, with the thumbs facing away from the body. Eight small and three large bangles cover the arms. The chest is covered with what appear to be necklaces, and a double band wraps around the waist. The figure wears a tall and elaborate headdress with central fan-shaped structure flanked by two large striated horns. The human figure is surrounded by four wild animals: an elephant and a tiger to its one side, and a water buffalo and a rhinoceros on the other. Under the dais are two deer or ibexes looking backwards, so that their horns almost meet the center. At the top of the seal are seven [[Indus script|pictographs]], with the last apparently displaced downwards for lack of horizontal space.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=141}}{{sfn|Marshall|1931|p=52}}

==Identification with proto-Shiva==

===Marshall's analysis===
An early description and analysis of the seal's iconography was provided by archaeologist [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] who had served as the Director-General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] and led the excavations of the Indus Valley sites. In addition to the general features of the seal described above, he also saw the central figure as a male deity; as three-faced, with a possible fourth face towards the back; and, as [[ithyphallic]], while conceding that what appeared to be the exposed phallus could instead be a tassel hanging from the waistband. Most significantly he identified the seal as an early prototype of the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] (or, his Vedic predecessor, [[Rudra]]), who also was known by the title [[Pashupati]] ('lord or father of all the animals') in historic times.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=52-57}} In a 1928&amp;ndash;29 publication, Marshall summarized his reasons for the identification as follows:
{{quote|My reasons for the identification are four. In the first place the figure has three faces and that Siva was portrayed with three as well as with more usual five faces, there are abundant examples to prove. Secondly, the head is crowned with the horns of a bull and the ''[[trishul (weapon)|trisula]]'' are characteristic emblems of Siva. Thirdly, the figure is in a typical yoga attitude, and Siva was and still is, regarded as a ''mahayogi''&amp;mdash;the prince of ''[[Yogi]]s''. Fourthly, he is surrounded by animals, and Siva is par excellence the "Lord of Animals" (''Pasupati'')&amp;mdash;of the wild animals of the jungle, according to the Vedic meaning of the word ''pashu'', no less than that of domesticated cattle.{{sfn|Mackay|1928-29|pp=74-75}}}}
Later, in 1931, he expanded his reasons to include the fact that Shiva is associated with the phallus in the form of ''[[linga]]'', and that in medieval art he is shown with deer or ibexes, as are seen below the throne on the seal.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=52-57}}{{sfn|McEvilley|pp=45-46}} Marshall's analysis of the Indus Valley religion, and the Pashupati seal in particular, was very influential and widely accepted for at least the next two generations. For instance, Herbert Sullivan, wrote in 1964 that Marshall's analysis "has been accepted almost universally and has greatly influenced scholarly understanding of the historical development of Hinduism".{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}} Writing in 1976, [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] introduced an article otherwise critical of Marshall's interpretation by observing that "no matter what position is taken regarding the seal's iconography, it is always prefaced by Marshall's interpretation. On balance the proto-{{IAST|Śiva}} character of the seal has been accepted."{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975-76|p=47}} And [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] noted that, following Marshall's analysis, "nearly all efforts at interpreting the [Indus Valley] religion have centered discussion around [the Pashupati seal] figure".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|p=399}}

===Objections and alternate interpretations===
A lot of discussion has taken place about this seal.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin, p.163"&gt;Bryant, Edwin, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections.&lt;ref&gt;See e. g. James G. Lochtefeld, ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', vol. 2: N–Z. The Rosen Publishing Group, New York 2002, p. 633, who doubts the connection of the seal to Shiva, given the supposedly late age of the god.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in [[Vedas|Vedic literature]]  Rudra was not a protector of wild animals.{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975-76}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|p=180-181}} Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with ''Mahisha'', the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with [[vahana]]s (vehicles, mounts) of deities for the four cardinal directions.{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}}{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|pp=399-432}} However, Mahisha strikingly resembles Mahesha, an epithet of Shiva Pashupati, besides recalling his vehicle, or vahana Nandi, the bull. This seems to provide further evidence for the interpretation of the Pashupati seal as a proto-Shiva archetype.&lt;ref&gt;Chitgopekar, Nilima. ''Book of Durga.''  Penguin Books India, [2009] p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Various interpretations have been connected to the seal, some relating it to the  Vedic deities: [[Rudra]], [[Agni]], Mahisha, [[Varuna]], Yogi, Yogi with Trident as head dress, [[Rishyasringa|Ŗșyaśŗnga]] (sage with horns) who is a contemporary of Dasarataand{{fact|date=June 2017}}; and  some non-aryan deities, including the unlikely Dravidian origin, sitting in yoga posture.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin, p.163"/&gt;

===Current opinion===
Writing in 2002, [[Gregory L. Possehl]] concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognize the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would "go too far."{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141-144}}

'''''Practical Mysticism''''' is a book written by [[Evelyn Underhill]] and first published in 1915.  In this book Underhill sets out her belief that [[Spirituality|spiritual life]] is part of [[human nature]] and as such is available to every [[Human|human being]].&lt;ref name=xcather&gt;Cather, Willa. ''The Professor's House'', New York: Knopf, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; Underhill's practical [[mysticism]] is [[Secularity|secular]] rather than [[Religion|religious]], since "it is a natural human activity."&lt;ref name=underhill&gt;Underhill, Evelyn. ''Mysticism'', New York: Meridian Books, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following paragraph, Underhill defines the meaning of the phrase "Practical Mysticism":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore it is to a practical mysticism that the practical man is here invited: to a training of his latent faculties, a bracing and brightening of his languid consciousness, an emancipation from the fetters of appearance, a turning of his attention to new levels of the world. Thus he may become aware of the universe that the spiritual artist is always trying to disclose to the race. This amount of mystical perception---this 'ordinary contemplation', as the specialist call it,---is possible to all men: without it, they are not wholly alive. It is a natural human activity&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Underhill's book was written at the outbreak of [[World War I]], at a time of "struggle and endurance, practical sacrifices, difficult and long continuous effort"&lt;ref name=underhill/&gt; when, she believed, practical mysticism was the activity needed most.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1895">'''[[Protestants]] in the [[Dominican Republic]]''' represent estimated 11% of population. Morgan Foley was the leader of the Protestantism for women in the 19th century. During the 1820s, Protestants migrated to the Dominican Republic from the [[United States]]. [[West Indian]] Protestants arrived on the island late 19th and the early 20th centuries, and by the 1920s, several Protestant organizations were established all throughout the country, which added diversity to the religious representation in the Dominican Republic. Many of the Protestant groups in DR had connections with organizations in the United States including Evangelical groups like the [[Assemblies of God]], the [[Evangelical Church of the Dominican Republic]] (a united [[Methodist]]-[[Presbyterian]] church), and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. These groups dominated the Protestant movement in the earlier part of the 20th century, but in the 1960s and 1970s Pentecostal  churches saw the most growth. Protestant denominations active in the Dominican Republic now include:

*[[Assembly of God]]
*[[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]]
*[[Baptist]]
*[[Pentecostal]]
*[[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]

Missionaries, [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalians]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], Mormons, and [[Mennonites]], also travel to the island. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], specifically, have been known to be migrating (more so during the last decade) to the [[Dominican Republic]] where they feel there is a "great need" for evangelizing their faith. However they are not seen as Protestant denomination by mainstream Christianity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41805">'''Asia''' is the largest and most populous continent, with a wide variety of '''religions''', and was the birthplace of many religions such as &lt;!-- Alphabetical order --&gt;[[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]],  [[Confucianism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Shintoism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]]. All major religious traditions are practiced in the region and new forms are constantly emerging. Asia is noted for its diversity of culture.

==Dharmic religions==
{{Main article|Indian religions}}
Dharmic religions are the predominant and oldest religions of Asia. Most of Asia's population follows Indian religions. All Indian religions originated in [[South Asia]]. These religions all have the concepts of [[dharma]], [[karma]], and [[reincarnation]].

===Hinduism ===

Hinduism is subdivided into a number of major currents, the primary ones being Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Smartism and Shaktism. The vast majority of present-day Hindus can be categorized under one of these four groups, although there are many other, partly overlapping, allegiances and denominations.

Hinduism predates recorded history and is thought to have had a beginning during the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] itself. It has no single founder; rather, it is a diverse melange of traditions, practices, and lineages. [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]] emerged in ancient India from Hinduism.

===Jainism===
{{Main article|Jainism}}
Jainism is an [[Indian religions|Indian religion]]. Jains are mostly found in [[India]] but are increasingly found throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Estimates for the population of Jains differ from just over four million to twelve million due to difficulties of Jain identity, with Jains in some areas counted as a Hindu sect. Many Jains do not return Jainism as their religion on census forms for various reasons such as certain Jain castes considering themselves both Hindu and Jain. The 1981 Census of India returned 3.19 million Jains. This was estimated at the time to be at least half the true number. There are an estimated 25,000-30,000 Jains in Europe (mostly in Britain), 20,000 in Africa, 45,000 plus in North America (from {{cite book |title=The Jains |last=Dundas |first=Paul |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=9780415266062 |page=271; 354 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=jains+britain#v=onepage&amp;q=jains%20britain&amp;f=false }}) and 5,000 in the rest of Asia.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains have significantly influenced and contributed to [[ethics|ethical]], [[politics|political]] and economic spheres in India. Jains have an ancient tradition of scholarship and have the highest degree of literacy for a religious community in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=3724 |title=Press Information Bureau, Government of India |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2004-09-06 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net |title=Census of India 2001 |publisher=Censusindia.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain libraries are the oldest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Jain Knowledge Warehouses: Traditional Libraries in India, John E.

The religion professes its roots in the area of [[Punjab region|Punjab]], whose territories form part of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].

This system of religious philosophy and expression has been traditionally known as the Gurmat (literally the counsel of the gurus) or the Sikh Dharm. Sikhism originated from the word Sikh, which in turn comes from the Sanskrit root śhiṣhya meaning "disciple" or "learner", or śhikṣha meaning "instruction".

Sikhism is the 4th largest religion in India with 2% of the total population being Sikh. There is also a large concentration of Sikhs in [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], [[the Philippines]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Hongkong]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kuwait]] and [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E]].

==East Asian religions==
{{Main article|East Asian religions}}
East Asian religions (also known as [[Far Eastern religions]], [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]], or [[Taoic religions]]) form a subset of the [[Eastern religions]].

===Confucianism ===
{{Main article|Confucianism}}
Confucianism was founded in ancient [[China]] by [[Confucius]] (551 B.C.E. - 479). Confucianism is a complex of [[morality|moral]], [[social philosophy|social]], [[politics|political]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]], and [[religion|religious]] concerns that permeated the culture and history of [[East Asia]]. Confucianism emphasizes family, social hierarchy, and personal integrity and is manifested in practices and attitudes rather than institutions and is centered on the family and local society. It was, however, considered the [[state religion]] of East Asian countries in some periods. Today the [[Chinese diaspora|Chinese]], [[Korean diaspora|Korean]], [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese diaspora|Vietnamese]] diasporas have brought Confucianism to all parts of the world.

===Taoism===
{{Main article|Taoism}}
Taoism (also [[romanized]] Daoism) is a diverse philosophical and religious tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the [[Tao]] ([[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanized "Dao"]]), a term that means "way", "path" or "principle". The concept is shared with other Chinese philosophies and religions. In Taoism, however, ''Tao'' denotes both the source and the driving force inherent in everything that exists. It is ultimately [[Ineffability|ineffable]]: "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/gateway/passages/tao-te-ching.htm|title=Tao Te Ching, 1. chapter, translated by Livia Kohn (1993)|author=Laozi|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laozi]] is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism and is closely associated with "original", or "primordial", Taoism.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 63"&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he actually existed is commonly disputed;&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2004, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; however, the work attributed to him – the [[Daodejing]] – is dated to the late 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2004, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoist propriety and ethics vary according to the particular school, but in general tends to emphasize [[wu-wei]] (action through non-action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: compassion, moderation, and humility.

Significant Taoist communities can be found in China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam and in the [[Chinese diaspora|Chinese]], [[Korean diaspora|Korean]], [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese diaspora|Vietnamese]] diasporas.

===Chinese folk religion===
{{Main article|Chinese folk religion}}
[[Chinese folk religion]] is a label used to describe the ethnic religious traditions which have been a main belief system in China and among the Han Chinese ethnic group for most of the civilization's history. This group of diverse beliefs comprises [[Chinese mythology]] and includes the worship of various [[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]] (神, shén; "deities", "spirits", "awarenesses", "consciousnesses", "archetypes") which can be nature deities, Taizu or clan deities, city deities, national deities, cultural heroes and demigods, dragons and ancestors. Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with Taoism, since over the world institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administer local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a component of Chinese religion, since it sprang out of folk religion and [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous. With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population, Chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world. In China more than 30% of the population adheres to folk religions or Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ChartsBin |url=http://chartsbin.com/view/sgx |title=Chinese Folk Religion Adherents by Country |publisher=Chartsbin.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shinto===
{{Main article|Shintoism}}
[[Kami-no-michi]] is almost unique to [[Japan]] and the [[Japanese diaspora]]. It is a set of practices carried out to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient past. Shinto practices were first recorded and codified in the written records of the [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]] in the 7th and 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified "Shinto religion", but rather to disorganized [[folklore]], [[History of Japan|history]], and [[mythology]]. Shinto today applies to public [[shrine]]s suited to various purposes such as [[Yasukuni|war memorial]]s, [[harvest festival]]s, romance, and historical monuments, as well as various sectarian organizations.

[[Shinto]] is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as "Shintoists" in surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/honcho/index.html |title=Association of Shinto Shrines &amp;#124; 設立 |publisher=Jinja Honcho |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to surveys carried out in 2006 and 2008 show that 3% to 3.9% of the population of Japan are members of [[Shinto sects and schools#Shintō inspired religions|Shinto sects and derived religions]].&lt;ref name="NHK2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/bunken/summary/research/report/2009_05/090505.pdf |title=2008 NHK survey of religion in Japan — 宗教的なもの にひかれる日本人〜ISSP国際比較調査（宗教）から〜|publisher=NHK Culture Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the ''mudang'', usually a woman, is to act as intermediary between a spirit entity, spirits or [[gods]] and human beings.

Women are enlisted by those who want the help of the [[Spirit|spirit world]]. Shamans hold ''[[gut (ritual)|gut]]'', or services, in order to gain good fortune for clients, cure illnesses by exorcising negative or 'bad' [[spirits]] that cling to people, or propitiate local or village gods. Such services are also held to guide the spirit of a deceased person to higher realms. Today this religion is a minority, but has in recent years seen a resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/06/world/asia/06iht-shaman.1.6527738.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{See also|Zoroastrianism in India|Zoroastrians in Iran}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] was once the state religion of the [[Persian Empire]], but is now a minority mostly found in [[India]] and [[Iran]]. It worships a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] god, [[Ahura Mazda]], and was founded by [[Zoroaster]]. Zoroastrianism is a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra, in Avestan), probably founded some time before the 6th century BC. The term Zoroastrianism is, in general usage, essentially synonymous with Mazdaism, i.e., the worship of Ahura Mazda, exalted by Zoroaster as the supreme divine authority.

In Zoroastrianism, the Creator Ahura Mazda is all good, and no evil originates from Him. Thus, in Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil (druj) trying to destroy the creation of Mazda (asha), and good trying to sustain it. Mazda is not immanent in the world, and His creation is represented by the Amesha Spentas and the host of other Yazatas, through whom the works of God are evident to humanity, and through whom worship of Mazda is ultimately directed. The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta, of which a significant portion has been lost, and mostly only the liturgies of which have survived. The lost portions are known of only through references and brief quotations in the later works of (primarily) the 9th-11th centuries.

The total number of currently practicing adherents of [[Zoroastrianism]] is unknown. A 2004 estimate gives a range of 124,000 to 190,000,&lt;ref&gt;
According to a survey in 2004 by the Zoroastrian Associations of North America, the number of Zoroastrians worldwide was estimated at between 124,000 and 190,000. The number is imprecise because of wildly diverging counts in Iran.{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/us/06faith.html|title=Zoroastrians Keep the Faith, and Keep Dwindling|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-09-06|accessdate=2009-10-03 | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly half of them in [[India]] (the [[Parsi]] and [[Irani (India)|Irani]] groups).

The largest number of Zoroastrians in Asia can be found in [[India]]; according to the 2001 census, they amounted 69,000.&lt;ref&gt;India's 2001 Census reported 69,601 Parsi Zoroastrians.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iran]], there were some 25,000 according to the 2011 census.&lt;ref&gt;25,271 according to http://www.amar.org.ir/Portals/1/Iran/census-2.pdf {{year needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the numbers for Zoroastrians were; India (61,000), Iran (15,000 / 22,271), [[United States]] (14,405), [[Canada]] (6,442), [[Great Britain]] (5,500), [[Australia]] (2,577), [[Arab states of the Arabian Gulf|Persian Gulf Countries]] (1,900) [[Pakistan]] (1,675), [[Singapore]] (372).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fezana.org/downloads/ZoroastrianWorldPopTable_FEZANA_Journal_Fall_2013.pdf Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main article|Islam in Asia}}
[[Image:Mazar-e Sharif - scene.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Mosque in [[Afghanistan]]]]
[[Islam]] is the largest religion in Asia with approx. 1.1 billion adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-muslim/ |title=THE GLOBAL RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE: Muslims |accessdate=2012-12-18 |work=pewforum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion articulated by the Qur'an, a book considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God (Arabic: الله Allāh) and by the teachings and normative example (called the Sunnah and composed of hadith) of Muhammad, considered by them to be the last prophet of God. [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] are home of the most populous Muslim countries, with [[Islam in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Islam in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Islam in India|India]], and [[Islam in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] having more than 100 million adherents each. According to [[United States|U.S.]] government figures, in 2006 there were 20 million Muslims in [[Islam in China|China]]. In the [[Western Asia]], the non-Arab countries of [[Islam in Iran|Iran]] and [[Islam in Turkey|Turkey]] are the largest Muslim-majority countries. In South Asia, [[Islam in Pakistan|Pakistan]] and [[Islam in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] are the countries with the largest Muslim-majority. In Central Asia, [[Islam in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and [[Islam in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] are the countries with the largest Muslim-majority.

[[Indonesia]] is 87 percent Muslim and is the country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Pakistan is 97 percent Muslim, Bangladesh is 90 percent Muslim.
India's Muslim population is 14.2% of the total, approximately 190 million people.&lt;ref&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-is-secular-because-most-hindus-are-secular-former-cec-sy-quraishi/articleshow/60899458.cms&lt;/ref&gt; Around 6-11 percent, some 6 - 12 million people in the Philippines are Muslim.&lt;ref name=NSO2014&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/sites/default/files/2014%20PIF.pdf Philippines in Figures : 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728203542/http://www.census.gov.ph/sites/default/files/2014%20PIF.pdf |date=2014-07-28 }}, [[Philippine Statistics Authority]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncmf.gov.ph/|title=Welcome to NCMF|author=Author Name|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil.ph/OG5_articles/understanding.htm |title=Understanding The Mindanao Insergency |publisher=Army.mil.ph |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108092335/http://www.army.mil.ph/OG5_articles/understanding.htm |archivedate=2015-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2004/35425.htm |title=Philippines |publisher=State.gov |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community, a minority Muslim sect, originated on the Asian continent in 1889 in Qadian, India. The community had 10 million members as of the 1980s. As of 2008, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has been established in all Asian countries except for Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia and North Korea. Ahmadis are most [[Persecution of Ahmadiyya|persecuted]] in Asia, particularly in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia.

===Bahá'í Faith===
[[File:Bahá'í House of Worship, Battambang.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Bahá'í Temple ([[Battambang]], [[Cambodia]])]]
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith in Asia}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion although it is quite different from [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]]. It was so founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in what was then Persia (also known as Iran). Today the largest national population of Bahá'ís is in [[Bahá'í Faith in India|India]] with between 1.7 million&lt;ref&gt;Source: Year 2000 Estimated Baha'i statistics from: David Barrett, World Christian Encyclopedia, 2000; Total population statistics, mid-2000 from Population Reference Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; to 3.2 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahaindia.org/ National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India]&lt;/ref&gt; where there is also the [[Lotus Temple]]. Significant populations are found in many countries including [[Bahá'í Faith in Vietnam|Vietnam]] and [[Religion in Malaysia|Malaysia]] where "about 1%", some 260,000, of the population are Bahá'ís.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai.org.my/main/content/view/42/46/ National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706164701/http://bahai.org.my/main/content/view/42/46/ |date=2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, like [[Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] there are 25 Local Spiritual Assemblies.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web | author = Government of Kazakhstan | title = Religious Groups in Kazakhstan | work = 2001 Census | publisher = Embassy of Kazakhstan to the USA &amp; Canada | year = 2001 | url = http://www.kazakhembus.com/files/Religious_Groups_in_Kazakhstan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern-day Iran, the religion is severely persecuted (see [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]]). In neighboring [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]], Bahá'í Faith is effectively banned,&lt;ref name="turk"&gt;{{cite web | last = compiled by Wagner | first = Ralph D. | title = Turkmenistan | work = Synopsis of References to the Bahá'í Faith, in the US State Department's Reports on Human Rights 1991–2000 | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url = http://bahai-library.com/documents/hr/hr-turkmenistan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals have had their homes raided for [[Bahá'í literature]].&lt;ref name="raided"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Corley | first = Felix | author-link = Felix Corley | title = TURKMENISTAN: Religious communities theoretically permitted, but attacked in practice? | newspaper = F18News | date = 2004-04-01 | url = http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=293 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; For further information, see [[Bahá'í statistics#Asia|Bahá'í Statistics for Asia]] and [[:Category:Bahá'í Faith by country]].

==Irreligion ==
According to a [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2012 [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]] (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 21.2% of Asia population.&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx Religiously Unaffiliated]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same survey, the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population in four Asian countries/territories: [[North Korea]] (71%), [[Japan]] (57%), [[Hong Kong]] (56%), and [[Mainland China]] (52%).&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"/&gt;

Other sources say that in the [[People's Republic of China]], 59% of the population claim to be [[Irreligion|non-religious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China – People |work=World Desk Reference |url=http://dev.prenhall.com/divisions/hss/worldreference/CN/people.html |accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this percentage may be significantly greater (up to 80%) or smaller (down to 30%) in reality, because some Chinese define religion differently. Some Chinese define religion as practicing customs (which may be done for cultural or traditional reasons), while others define it as actually consciously believing their religion will lead to post-mortem salvation or reincarnation. A Dentsu statistic states that 46% of Vietnamese and 51% of Japanese are irreligious.&lt;ref name="dentsu"&gt;[http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html Dentsu Communication Institute Inc., Research Centre for Japan (2006)]{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1901">'''Seminary priests''' were [[Roman Catholic]] [[priests]] who were trained in [[England|English]] [[seminaries]] or houses of study on the [[European continent]] after the introduction of laws forbidding Roman Catholicism in Britain. Such Seminaries included that at [[English College, Douai|Douay]], from 1568, and others at [[Rome]] from 1579, [[Valladolid]] from 1589, [[Seville]] from 1592, [[Colleges of St Omer, Bruges and Liège|St Omer]] (later at [[Bruges]] and [[Liège]]) from 1593, and [[Lisbon]] from 1628. The English College at Douai was transferred to [[Rheims]] during the years 1578–1593.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;{{cite book|title=Butler's Lives of the Saints|author= Alban Butler|year= 1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|pages=34, 228|isbn=0-86012-253-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "seminary priest" distinguishes these men especially from those trained at an earlier period in England. In particular, those ordained in the time of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] are often called "[[Marian Priests]]". These latter priests and others ordained at a still earlier period were not "seminary priests" in any sense because in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] of their day the system of training priests in seminaries had not yet been introduced. The institution of seminaries followed the [[Council of Trent]]. The first of the seminary priests to [[martyr|die for his faith]] was [[Cuthbert Mayne|Saint Cuthbert Mayne]] and for this he is sometimes referred to by the title of "protomartyr of the seminary priests".&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;

'''''The Occult Roots of Nazism: The Ariosophists of Austria and Germany, 1890-1935''''' is a book about [[Nazi occultism]] and [[Ariosophy]] by historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], who traces some of its roots back to [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria]] between 1880 and 1945. The foreword is by [[Rohan Butler]], who had written ''The Roots of National Socialism'' in the 1930s. The book is based on Goodrick-Clarke's 1982 Ph.D. [[thesis]] ''The ariosophists of Austria and Germany 1890-1935: Reactionary political fantasy in relation to social anxiety''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.scientificcommons.org/31951906 |title=Scientific Commons |publisher=En.scientificcommons.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This book has been continually in print since its first publication in 1985, and has been translated into twelve languages, including Spanish, French, Polish, Italian, Russian, Czech, German and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;German edition, front jacket&lt;/ref&gt; It was republished as a paperback by [[New York University]] Press in 1992 ({{ISBN|0-8147-3060-4}}), and more recently republished by [[I.B. Tauris|I.B. Tauris &amp; Co]] Ltd ({{ISBN|1-86064-973-4}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13176">'''''The True Word''''' (or ''Discourse, Account'', ''Doctrine''; {{lang-grc-gre|Λόγος Ἀληθής}}, ''Logos Alēthēs'') is a lost treatise in which the ancient [[Greek philosopher]] [[Celsus]] addressed many principal points of [[Early Christianity]] and refuted or argued against their validity.  In ''The True Word'', [[Celsus]] attacked Christianity in three ways; by refuting its philosophical claims, by marking it as a phenomenon associated with the uneducated and lower class, and by cautioning his audience that it was a danger to the [[Roman Empire]].  All information concerning the work exists only in the extensive quotations from it in the ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' ("Against Celsus") written some seventy years later by the Christian [[Origen]]. These are believed to be accurate as far as they go, but may not give a fully comprehensive picture of the original work.

==Criticism of Christianity before Celsus==
Celsus was only one writer in a long tradition of Roman writers and philosophers who wrote and spoke out against Christianity, feeling that their doctrines were either inscrutable or downright foolish.  The primary problem that most Roman citizens and the Imperial government had regarding the Christians was their adamant refusal to participate in the required [[sacrifice]]s that were regularly made to the Emperor and the Roman state, sacrifices that were an integral part of Roman politics, religion, and culture.  Most Romans could not understand the Christians' insistence on their own superiority and their insistence upon their apparently exclusive path to [[salvation]].  They could also not understand Christianity’s claims that they were a unique religion with a long history reaching back to [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]], when the Roman philosophers knew that [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christianity had broken off from Judaism]] relatively recently and still used [[Hebrew Bible|ancient Jewish texts]] both to formulate their theology and to support their religious claims.  These Roman writers, who often professed to be loyal members of the Empire and Roman society, were also “troubled by the seeming incoherence of the Christian position toward society and towards the recognized religion of the state”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|1987|p= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these factors led to Christians being classified as enemies of society.  Roman philosophers also attacked Christian moral and ethical principles because “the Christianity of the first century had yet to develop an assailable system of belief or a fixed canon of writings from which such beliefs could be educed”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|1987|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Celsus was only one among many, including [[Lucian]], who wrote against Christianity.

==Celsus and his work==
Celsus was either a Greek or a Roman who wrote during the latter half of the 2nd century AD.  Very little is known about his origins or life.  The work in its original form has been lost and the ''True Word'' survives only as excerpts from a work by the Christian scholar [[Origen]], who quoted Celsus to rebut him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baltes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Origen stated that Celsus was from the first half of the 2nd century A.D., although the majority of modern scholars have come to a general consensus that Celsus probably wrote around 170 to 180 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|1987|p=30-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern scholars are in agreement that Celsus did not rely on the “[[rumor]]s and [[hearsay]] evidence” &lt;ref&gt;Benko, Stephen. “Pagan Rome and the Early Christians”.  Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1984. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; that many other Christian detractors of the time period used, but rather drew upon his own observations and displayed knowledge of both the [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[New Testament]] of the Christian Bible, as well as other Jewish and Christian writings.

==Philosophical and theological arguments==
Celsus’ first main point in his ''True Word'' was to refute the validity of Christianity.  In his opinion Christian theology was based on an amalgamation of false [[Eastern Philosophy|eastern philosophical ideas]] hastily tied together.  He stated that Christians would “weave together erroneous opinions drawn from ancient sources and trumpet them aloud”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=Bk. III, ch. 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Celsus gave a point by point critique of Christian doctrine, and why it should not have been believed by anyone.  He denied the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], and accused Mary of being an adulteress turned out by her husband.  His theory was not new, as even Jews at that time were saying the same.{{cn|date=July 2017}}  The remainder of Christian stories – what now makes up the Christian [[Bible]]- Celsus found very insipid and unappealing compared to Greek and Roman legends of powerful and colorful gods.  Celsus also found Christian philosophy lacking when compared to secular philosophy, and declared that “things are stated much better among the Greeks”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc= ''Ignorance, Irrationality, and Superstition'' Bk. VI, ch. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Celsus used [[Plato]] as the representative for Greek philosophers and, according to him, when comparing the two philosophical traditions Christianity appeared far worse, as "Plato is not guilty of boasting and falsehood",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Ignorance, Irrationality, and Superstition'' Bk. VI, ch. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a crime which Celsus obviously feels is a trademark of Christian theologians.  The only connection Celsus made between Greek philosophy and Christianity was when he asserted that “Jesus perverted the words of the philosopher”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Ignorance, Irrationality, and Superstition'' Bk. VI, ch. 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. Plato).

When compared with the gods of Roman and Greek mythology, Celsus found the Christian God sadly lacking, and declared that he could not be a god as he was neither [[all-knowing]] nor [[all-powerful]].  Celsus could deduce no explanation for the actions of the Christian God, such as the floods, natural disasters, and the introduction of [[problem of evil|evil]] into the world, except that God wanted to draw attention to his greatness because he felt [[human]]ity was giving him “less than his due”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Judaism and Christianity'', Bk. VI, ch. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Celsus concluded that Christians used the explanation of God "testing" them to disguise the fact that their God was not powerful enough to successfully fight [[Satan]], but was instead “helpless”.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Ignorance, Irrationality, and Superstition'' Bk. VI, ch. 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Celsus wrote that Satan was either a mortal invention used by Christians to frighten others into believing their philosophies and joining them, or if he did indeed exist then he was proof that God was not all-powerful, but rather a weak lesser god and a bad one, for only a vindictive and insecure being would punish mankind for being tricked by an evil that he has been too weak to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The apparent “blind faith” of the Christians was bewildering to Celsus, and he used it to further support his claim that Christianity was a false religion.  In his opinion, the main tenet of Christianity was “Do not ask questions, just believe” and “Thy faith will save thee".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Ignorance, Irrationality, and Superstition'' Bk. I, ch. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status and the appeal of Christianity==
Celsus complained that Christianity was a phenomenon limited primarily to the lower class.  He claimed that Christians actively sought out and converted the ignorant, uneducated, and lower class, as they were the only people who would believe in such a ridiculous theology and blindly follow its doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Ignorance, Irrationality, and Superstition'' Bk. III, ch. 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If an individual was from the upper class, and therefore well educated and naturally of good character, they would not be converted because they could not possibly believe in the absurd assumptions one had to in order to be considered “Christian”.    Celsus revealed himself to be a member of the upper class when he makes his statements regarding Jesus; who obviously could not be the son of god as he was born a peasant.  The ''True Word'' stated that Mary would have been unworthy to be noticed by God “because she was neither rich nor of royal rank”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Jesus and the Jewish Critics'', Bk. I, ch. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Celsus also claimed that Christianity was against personal betterment, as that could cause their followers to discover the fallacies within their religion.  Celsus declared that Christians convert by “lead[ing] on wicked men by empty hopes, and to persuade them to despise better things, saying that if they refrain from them it will be better…”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Ignorance, Irrationality, and Superstition'' – Bk. III, ch. 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/celsus/celsus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity as a danger to Rome==
Celsus’ main argument against Christianity, and why he attacked it with such vigor, was that he considered it a divisive and destructive force that would harm both the Roman Empire and society.  Adherence to the state supported Roman religion was compulsory and the Roman authorities felt it was necessary for the effective management of the political system.  One of the most integral parts of the Roman state religion was reverence and occasional sacrifices for the Emperor, an act that Christians continually refused to participate in, as in their opinion it came too close to [[idolatry]] and worship of a God that was not their own.  

Celsus listed many reasons for how his Roman readers could easily deduce that Christianity was endangering their unity and the stability of the Empire.  Christianity originated from Judaism, whose adherents, although living within the Empire, had already [[Jewish–Roman wars|revolted against Roman rule several times]].  The Christian community then became further divided amongst themselves, and Celsus complained that “matters are determined in different ways by the various sects”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Ignorance, Irrationality, and Superstition'' – Bk. III, ch. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This dissension between different factions within Christianity proved to the Romans that Christians who could not even draw together under their own shared beliefs were naturally a divisive people and not only caused friction within their own philosophy but would disrupt the unity of the Empire.  Finally Celsus and other Roman writers believed that “Christians are dangerous precisely because they put the advancement of their beliefs above the common good and the welfare of the state”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|1987|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secrecy in which Christians met and practiced was another problem for Celsus.  He commented that they “entered into secret associations with each other contrary to law”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Christians and Society'' Bk. I, ch.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Celsus stated that there was nothing wrong with swearing allegiance to a king or emperor, as he provided the stable environment in which all citizens could freely live, and in return it was the duty of each Roman citizen to assist the Emperor and “labor with him in the maintenance of justice”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Christians and Society'' Bk. VIII, ch. 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celsus provided only one solution to solve the problems that he believed Christianity would inevitably create within the Empire.  He commanded that Christians must both respect the Emperor and perform rituals to the gods of the Roman state.  If they could not or would not participate in the Imperial religion they must not “take any share in the affairs of life; but… depart hence with all speed and leave no posterity behind them”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Celsus|2001|loc=''Christians and Society'' Bk. VIII, ch. 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46522">{{theosophy}}
Within the system of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], developed by [[occultist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]] and others since the second half of the 19th century, '''Theosophical mysticism''' draws upon various existing disciplines and mystical models, including [[Neo-platonism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Western esotericism]], [[Freemasonry]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].

==Overview of Blavatsky's teachings==

The three fundamental propositions expounded in ''The Secret Doctrine'' are –&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sellon|1987}} v. II, p. 245-246&lt;/ref&gt;
# that there is an omnipresent, eternal, boundless, and immutable reality of which spirit and matter are complementary aspects;
# that there is a universal law of periodicity or evolution through cyclic change; and
# that all souls are identical with the universal oversoul which is itself an aspect of the unknown reality.

Helena Blavatsky taught that Theosophy is neither revelation nor speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blavatsky|1889}} p. 3-4, 7-12, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky stated that Theosophy was an attempt at a gradual, faithful reintroduction of a hitherto hidden science called the occult science in Theosophical literature. According to Blavatsky occult science provides a description of reality not only at a physical level but also on a metaphysical one. Blavatsky said occult science had been preserved and practiced throughout history by carefully selected and trained individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blavatsky|1888a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theosophical Society believes its precepts and doctrinal foundation will be verified when a Theosophist follows prescribed disciplines to develop metaphysical means of knowledge that transcend the limitations of the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellwood|first=Robert S|title=Theosophy: a modern expression of the ages|date=1986|publisher=The Theosophical Publishing House|isbn=0-8356-0607-4|pages=14, 16–17, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and origin==

Theosophy was considered by Blavatsky to be "the substratum and basis of all the world-religions and philosophies".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1918|p=304|ps=: "Theosophia"}} In ''The Key to Theosophy'', she stated the following about the meaning and origin of the term:
{{bq|ENQUIRER. Theosophy and its doctrines are often referred to as a new-fangled religion. Is it a religion?&lt;br&gt;
THEOSOPHIST. It is not. Theosophy is Divine Knowledge or Science.&lt;br&gt;
ENQUIRER. What is the real meaning of the term?&lt;br&gt;
THEOSOPHIST. "Divine Wisdom," (Theosophia) or Wisdom of the gods, as (theogonia), genealogy of the gods. The word theos means a god in Greek, one of the divine beings, certainly not "God" in the sense attached in our day to the term. Therefore, it is not "Wisdom of God", as translated by some, but Divine Wisdom such as that possessed by the gods. The term is many thousand years old.&lt;br&gt;
ENQUIRER. What is the origin of the name?&lt;br&gt;
THEOSOPHIST. It comes to us from the Alexandrian philosophers, called lovers of truth, Philaletheians, from phil "loving," and aletheia "truth". The name Theosophy dates from the third century of our era, and began with [[Ammonius Saccas]] and his disciples, who started the Eclectic Theosophical system.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1962|p=1&amp;ndash;4}}}}

According to her, all real lovers of divine wisdom and truth had, and have, a right to the name of Theosophist.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1918|pp=304&amp;ndash;305|ps=: "Theosophists"}} Blavatsky discussed the major themes of Theosophy in several major works, including ''The Secret Doctrine'', ''Isis Unveiled'', ''The Key to Theosophy'', and ''The Voice of the Silence''. She also wrote over 200 articles in various theosophical magazines and periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blavatsky.net/blavatsky/blavatsky-articles.htm|title=Blavatsky Articles|publisher=Blavatsky.net|accessdate=2014-05-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525064637/http://www.blavatsky.net/blavatsky/blavatsky-articles.htm|archivedate=2014-05-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries of Blavatsky, as well as later theosophists, contributed to the development of this school of theosophical thought, producing works that at times sought to elucidate the ideas she presented (see [[Gottfried de Purucker]]), and at times to expand upon them.{{efn|Some of the later works have become the focus of, or have contributed to, lively discussion among leading proponents of theosophy, and on occasion have led to serious doctrinal disputes. See [[Neo-Theosophy]].}} Since its inception, and through doctrinal assimilation or divergence, Theosophy has also given rise to or influenced the development of other mystical, philosophical, and religious movements.{{sfn|Melton|1990|pp=xxv–xxvi}}

Theosophists attribute the origin of Theosophy to a universal striving for spiritual fulfilment, which they assert exists in all cultures and at all times. According to Theosophical texts, kindred practices and philosophies are found in an unbroken chain in [[India]], but are also said to have existed in [[Ancient Greece]] and to be hinted in the writings of [[Plato]] (427–347 [[Common Era|BCE]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Phaedrus|author=Plato|others=[[Benjamin Jowett]]|year=c. 370 BC|quote=We are imprisoned in the body, like an oyster in his shell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Phaedo|author=Plato|others=[[Benjamin Jowett]]|year=1871|origyear=original c. 347-8 BC}}. The whole work, subtitled "On soul" has similarities with theosophical exposition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plotinus]] (204–270), and other neo-Platonists.

===Scope===

Broadly, Theosophy attempts to reconcile humanity's scientific, philosophical, and religious disciplines and practices into a unified [[worldview]]. As it largely employs a synthesizing approach, it makes extensive use of the vocabulary and concepts of many philosophical and religious traditions. However these, along with all other fields of knowledge, are investigated, amended, and explained within an [[esoteric]] or [[occult]] framework.
In often elaborate exposition, Theosophy's all-encompassing worldview proposes explanations for the origin, workings and [[ultimate fate of the universe]] and humanity; it has therefore also been called a system of "absolutist [[metaphysics]]".{{sfn|Wakoff|1998}}{{efn|Blavatsky stated that in practical terms, her Theosophical exposition concerned itself only "with our planetary System and what is visible around it".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=13}} "Bear in mind that the Stanzas given treat only of the Cosmogony of our own planetary System and what is visible around it, .... The secret teachings with regard to the Evolution of the Universal Kosmos cannot be given, .... Moreover the Teachers say openly that not even the highest Dhyani-Chohans have ever penetrated the mysteries beyond those boundaries that separate the milliards of Solar systems from the 'Central Sun,' as it is called. Therefore, that which is given, relates only to our visible Kosmos, ...." However, some of her statements have been unclear or contradictory on the subject and she often stressed, "Everything in the Universe follows analogy. 'As above, so below{{' "}}.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=177}}}}

===Methodology===

According to Blavatsky, Theosophy is neither [[revelation]] nor speculation.{{efn|"Faith is a word not to be found in theosophical dictionaries: we say knowledge based, on observation and experience. There is this difference, however, that while the observation and experience of physical science lead the Scientists to about as many 'working' hypotheses as there are minds to evolve them, our knowledge consents to add to its lore only those facts which have become undeniable, and which are fully and absolutely demonstrated. We have no two beliefs or hypotheses on the same subject."{{sfn|Blavatsky|2002|pp=3–4, 7–12, 87}}}} It is portrayed as an attempt at gradual, faithful reintroduction of a hitherto hidden science, which is called in Theosophical literature ''The Occult Science''. According to Blavatsky, this postulated science provides a description of Reality not only at a physical level, but also on a metaphysical one. The Occult Science is said to have been preserved (and practiced) throughout history by carefully selected and trained individuals.{{efn|"It is the uninterrupted record covering thousands of generations of Seers whose respective experiences were made to test and to verify the traditions passed orally by one early race to another, of the teachings of higher and exalted beings, who watched over the childhood of Humanity. That for long ages, the 'Wise Men' of the Fifth Race, ... had passed their lives ''in learning, not teaching''. ... By checking, testing, and verifying in every department of nature the traditions of old by the independent visions of great adepts; i.e., men who have developed and perfected their physical, mental, psychic, and spiritual organizations to the utmost possible degree. No vision of one adept was accepted until it was checked and confirmed by the visions—so obtained as to stand as independent evidence—of other adepts, and by centuries of experiences."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|pp=xxxviii, 272–273}}}} Theosophists further assert that Theosophy's precepts and their [[wikt:axiom#Noun|axiomatic]] foundation may be verified by following certain prescribed disciplines that develop in the practitioner metaphysical means of knowledge, which transcend the limitations of the senses.
It is commonly held by Theosophists that many of the basic Theosophical tenets may in the future be [[empirically]] and objectively verified by science, as it develops further.

====Law of correspondences====

In ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky spoke of a basic item of cosmogony reflected in the ancient saying: "as above, so below". This item is used by many theosophists as a method of study and has been called "The Law of Correspondences". Briefly, the law of correspondences states that the microcosm is the miniature copy of the macrocosm and therefore what is found "below" can be found, often through analogy, "above".
Examples include the basic structures of microcosmic organisms mirroring the structure of macrocosmic organisms (see septenary systems, below). The lifespan of a human being can be seen to follow, by analogy, the same path as the seasons of the Earth, and in theosophy it is postulated that the same general process is equally applied to the lifespan of a planet, a solar system, a galaxy and to the universe itself. Through the Law of Correspondences, a theosophist seeks to discover the first principles underlying various phenomena by finding the shared essence or idea, and thus to move from particulars to principles.

====Applications====
Applied Theosophy was one of the main reasons for the foundation of the Theosophical Society in 1875; the practice of Theosophy was considered an integral part of its contemporary incarnation.{{efn|"The Society is a philanthropic and scientific body for the propagation of the idea of brotherhood on ''practical'' instead of ''theoretical'' lines. The Fellows may be Christians or Mussulmen, Jews or Parsees, Buddhists or Brahmins, Spiritualists or Materialists, it does not matter; but every member must be either a philanthropist, or a scholar, a searcher into Aryan and other old literature, or a psychic student. In short, he has to help, if he can, in the carrying out of at least one of the objects of the programme."{{sfn|Blavatsky|2002|p=19}}}} Theosophical discipline includes the practice of study, meditation, and service, which are traditionally seen as necessary for a holistic development. Also, the acceptance and practical application of the Society's ''[[motto]]'' and of its three objectives are part of the Theosophical life.
Efforts at applying its tenets started early. Study and meditation are normally promoted in the activities of the [[Theosophical Society]], and in 1908 an international charitable organization to promote service, the [[Theosophical Order of Service]], was founded.

====Terminology====
Despite extensively using [[Sanskrit]] terminology in her works, many Theosophical concepts are expressed differently from in the original scriptures. To provide clarity on her intended meanings, Blavatsky's ''The Theosophical Glossary'' was published in 1892, one year after her death. According to its editor, [[George Robert Stowe Mead]], Blavatsky wished to express her indebtedness to four works: the ''Sanskrit-Chinese Dictionary'', the ''Hindu Classical Dictionary'', ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', and ''The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia''.{{sfn|Zirkoff|1967–1968}}

===Basic tenets===

====Three fundamental propositions====
Blavatsky explained the essential component ideas of her cosmogony in her [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''The Secret Doctrine''. She began with three fundamental propositions, of which she said:
{{bq|Before the reader proceeds … it is absolutely necessary that he should be made acquainted with the few fundamental conceptions which underlie and pervade the entire system of thought to which his attention is invited. These basic ideas are few in number, and on their clear apprehension depends the understanding of all that follows…{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=14}}}}

The first proposition is that there is one underlying, unconditioned, indivisible Truth, variously called "the Absolute", "the Unknown Root", "the One Reality", etc. It is causeless and timeless, and therefore unknowable and non-describable: "It is 'Be-ness' rather than Being".{{efn|"An Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable PRINCIPLE on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=14}}}} However, transient states of matter and consciousness are manifested in IT, in an unfolding gradation from the subtlest to the densest, the final of which is physical plane.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|pp=35–85}} According to this view, manifest existence is a "change of condition"{{efn|"The expansion 'from within without'..., does not allude to an expansion from a small centre or focus, but, without reference to size or limitation or area, means the development of limitless subjectivity into as limitless objectivity. ...It implies that this expansion, not being an increase in size—for infinite extension admits of no enlargement—was a change of condition."  Manifest existence is often called "Illusion" in Theosophy, owing to its conceptual and actual differentiation from the only Reality.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|pp=62–63}}}} and therefore neither the result of [[Creation myth|creation]] nor a random event.

Everything in the universe is informed by the potentialities present in the "Unknown Root," and manifest with different degrees of Life (or energy), Consciousness, and Matter.{{efn|"Everything in the Universe, throughout all its kingdoms, is CONSCIOUS: i.e., endowed with a consciousness of its own kind and on its own plane of perception. We men must remember that because we do not perceive any signs—which we can recognise—of consciousness, say, in stones, we have no right to say that ''no consciousness exists there''. There is no such thing as either 'dead' or 'blind' matter, as there is no 'Blind' or 'Unconscious' Law".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=274}}}}

The second proposition is "the absolute universality of that law of periodicity, of flux and reflux, ebb and flow". Accordingly, manifest existence is an eternally re-occurring event on a "boundless plane": {{" '}}the playground of numberless Universes incessantly manifesting and disappearing,{{' "}}{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=17}} each one "standing in the relation of an effect as regards its predecessor, and being a cause as regards its successor",{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=43}} doing so over vast but finite periods of time.{{efn|Blavatsky states that each complete cycle lasts 311,040,000,000,000 years.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=206}}}}

Related to the above is the third proposition: "The fundamental identity of all Souls with the Universal Over-Soul... and the obligatory pilgrimage for every Soul—a spark of the former—through the Cycle of Incarnation (or 'Necessity') in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic law, during the whole term."
The individual souls are seen as units of consciousness (Monads) that are intrinsic parts of a universal oversoul, just as different sparks are parts of a fire. These Monads undergo a process of evolution where consciousness unfolds and matter develops. This evolution is not random, but informed by intelligence and with a purpose. Evolution follows distinct paths in accord with certain immutable laws, aspects of which are perceivable on the physical level. One such law is the law of periodicity and cyclicity; another is the law of [[karma]] or cause and effect.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|pp=274–275}}

====Esotericism and symbolism====
In ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky quoted [[Gerald Massey]] a "suggestive analogy between the Aryan or Brahmanical and the Egyptian esotericism" She said that the "seven rays of the Chaldean Heptakis or Iao, on the Gnostic stones" represent the seven large stars of the ancient Egyptian [[Egyptian astronomy|Great Bear]] constellation, the seven elemental powers, and the Hindu "seven Rishis".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=227}}{{sfn|Massey|||ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Blavatsky|1888a|p=227}}{{Full citation needed|date=May 2014}}. It is unclear which Massey work Blavatsky was quoting.}} Blavatsky saw the seven rays of the Vedic sun deity Vishnu as representing the same concept as the "astral fluid or 'Light' of the Kabalists," and said that the seven emanations of the lower seven [[sephirot]]h are the "primeval seven rays", and "will be found and recognized in every religion."{{efn|{{cite book|title=The secret doctrine: the synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy|last=Blavatsky|first=Helena P.|publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society|year=1893|edition=Original from Harvard University |volume=1|pages=129–130, 523, 573–4|url=https://archive.org/details/secretdoctrines00blavgoog}}}}

Theosophy holds that the manifested universe is ordered by the number [[7|seven]],{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=36}} a common claim among [[esoteric]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] doctrines and religions. Thus, the evolutionary "pilgrimage" proceeds cyclically through seven stages, with the three first steps involving an apparent involution, the fourth one being one of equilibrium, and the last three involving a progressive development.

There are seven symbols of particular importance to the Society's symbology:
#the seal of the Society
#a serpent biting its tail
#the gnostic cross (near the serpent's head)
#the interlaced triangles
#the cruxansata (in the centre)
#the pin of the Society, composed of cruxansata and serpent entwined, forming together "T.S.", and
#''[[Om]]'' (or ''aum''), the sacred syllable of the [[Vedas]].
The seal of the Society contains all of these symbols, except ''aum'', and thus contains, in symbolic form, the doctrines its members follow.{{sfn|Nilakant|1886}}

====Septenary systems====
In the Theosophical view all major facets of existence manifest following a seven-fold model: "Our philosophy teaches us that, as there are seven fundamental forces in nature, and seven planes of being, so there are seven states of consciousness in which man can live, think, remember and have his being."{{sfn|Blavatsky|2002|p=89}}

=====Seven cosmic planes=====
{{Main article|Planes of existence}}

The Cosmos does not consist only of the physical plane that can be perceived with the five senses, but there is a succession of
seven [[Plane (cosmology)|Cosmic planes of existence]], composed of increasingly subtler forms of matter-energy, and in which states of consciousness other than the commonly known can manifest. [[Blavatsky]] described the planes according to these states of consciousness. In her system, for example, the plane of the material and concrete mind (lower mental plane) is classified as different from the plane of the spiritual and holistic mind (higher mental plane). Later Theosophists like [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]] classified the seven planes according to the kind of subtle matter that compose them. Since both the higher and lower mental planes share the same type of subtle matter, they regard them as one single plane with two subdivisions. In this later view the seven cosmic planes include (from spiritual to material):

#Adi (the supreme, a divine plane not reached by human beings)
#Anupadaka (the parentless, also a divine plane home of the divine spark in human beings, the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]])
#Atmic (the spiritual plane of Man's Higher Self)
#Buddhic (the spiritual plane of intuition, love, and wisdom)
#Mental (with a higher and lower subdivisions, this plane bridges the spiritual with the personal)
#Emotional (a personal plane that ranges from lower desires to high emotions)
#Physical plane (a personal plane which again has two subdivisions the dense one perceivable by our five senses, and an etheric one that is beyond these senses)

=====Seven principles and bodies=====
{{Main article|Subtle body}}

Just as the Cosmos is not limited to its physical dimension, human beings have also subtler dimensions and bodies. The "Septenary Nature of Man" was described by Blavatsky in, among other works, ''The Key to Theosophy''; in descending order, it ranges from a postulated purely spiritual essence (called a "Ray of the Absolute") to the physical body.{{sfn|Blavatsky|2002|pp=90–93}}

The Theosophical teachings about the constitution of human beings talk about two different, but related, things: principles and bodies. Principles are the seven basic constituents of the universe, usually described by Mme. Blavatsky as follows:

#Physical
#Astral (later called etheric)
#Prana (or vital)
#Kama (animal soul)
#Manas (mind, or human soul)
#Buddhi (spiritual soul)
#Atma (Spirit or Self)

These Principles in Man may or may not form one or more bodies. Blavatsky's teachings about subtle bodies were few and not very systematic. In an article she described three subtle bodies:{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888c}}
*''[[Linga sarira|Linga Sharira]]'' – the Double or [[Astral body]]
*''Mayavi-rupa'' – the "Illusion-body"
*''Causal Body'' – the vehicle of the higher Mind

The ''Linga Sharira'' is the invisible double of the human body, elsewhere referred to as the [[etheric body]] or [[doppelgänger]] and serves as a model or matrix of the physical body, which conforms to the shape, appearance and condition of his "double". The linga sarira can be separated or projected a limited distance from the body. When separated from the body it can be wounded by sharp objects. When it returns to the physical frame, the wound will be reflected in the physical counterpart, a phenomenon called "repercussion." At death, it is discarded together with the physical body and eventually disintegrates or decomposes. This can be seen over the graves like a luminous figure of the man that was, during certain atmospheric conditions.

The mayavi-rupa is dual in its functions, being:
"...the vehicle both of thought and of the animal passions and desires, drawing at one and the same time from the lowest terrestrial manas (mind) and Kama, the element of desire."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888c}}

The higher part of this body, containing the spiritual elements gathered during life, merges after death entirely into the causal body; while the lower part, containing the animal elements, forms the Kama-rupa, the source of "spooks" or [[ghost|apparitions]] of the dead.

Therefore, besides the dense physical body, the subtle bodies in a human being are:
*[[Etheric body]] (vehicle of [[prana]])
*[[Astral body|Emotional or astral body]] (vehicle of desires and emotions)
*Mental body (vehicle of the concrete or lower mind)
*Causal body (vehicle of the abstract or higher mind)

These bodies go up to the higher mental plane. The two higher spiritual Principles of Buddhi and Atma do not form bodies proper but are something more like "sheaths".

===Criticism===

Blavatsky was influential on [[spiritualism]] and related subcultures: "The western esoteric tradition has no more important figure in modern times."{{sfn|Johnson|1994}} She wrote prolifically, publishing thousands of pages and debate continues about her work. She taught about very abstract and metaphysical principles, but also sought to denounce and correct superstitions that, in her view, had grown in different esoteric religions. Some of these statements are controversial. For example, she quotes [[Anna Kingsford]] and [[Edward Maitland]]'s book ''The Perfect Way''.{{sfn|Kingsford|Maitland|1919|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Blavatsky|1888a}}}} "It is 'Satan who is the God of our planet and the only God', and this without any metaphorical allusion to its wickedness and depravity," wrote Blavatsky, in ''The Secret Doctrine''. "For he is one with the Logos."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=234}} He is whom "every dogmatic religion, preeminently the Christian, points out as [...] the enemy of God, [... but is] in reality, the highest divine Spirit&amp;mdash;Occult Wisdom on Earth. [...] Thus, the Latin Church [... and] the Protestant Church [... both] are fighting against divine Truth, when repudiating and slandering the Dragon of Esoteric Divine Wisdom. Whenever they anathematize the Gnostic Solar Chnouphis, the [[Agathodaemon]] Christos, or the Theosophical Serpent of Eternity, or even the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent of ''Genesis'']]."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=294}} In this reference Blavatsky explains that he whom the Christian dogma calls Lucifer was never the representative of the evil in ancient myths but, on the contrary, the light-bringer (which is the literal meaning of the name Lucifer). According to Blavatsky the church turned him into Satan (which means "the opponent") to misrepresent pre-Christian beliefs and fit him into the newly framed Christian dogmas. A similar view is also shared by some Christian Gnostics, ancient and modern.

Throughout much of Blavatsky's public life her work drew harsh criticism from some of the learned authorities of her day, as for example when she said that the atom was divisible.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=244}}

====Helena Blavatsky's skeptics====
[[Max Müller]], the renowned philologist and orientalist, was scathing in his criticism of Blavatsky's Esoteric Buddhism. Whilst he was willing to give her credit for good motives, at least at the beginning of her career, in his view she ceased to be truthful both to herself and to others with her later "hysterical writings and performances". Müller felt he had to speak out when he saw the Buddha being "lowered to the level of religious charlatans, or his teaching misrepresented as esoteric twaddle". There is a nothing esoteric or secretive in Buddhism, he wrote, in fact the very opposite. "Whatever was esoteric was ''ipso facto'' not Buddha's teaching; whatever was Buddha's teaching was ''ipso facto'' not esoteric".{{sfn|Müller|1893}}{{efn|For Sinnett's response and Müller's rejoinder, see {{harvnb|Sinnett|1893}} and {{harvnb|Müller|1893b}}.}} Blavatsky, it seemed to Müller, "was either deceived by others or carried away by her own imaginations" and that Buddha was "against the very idea of keeping anything secret".{{sfn|Müller|1902}}

Critics pronounced her claim of the existence of masters of wisdom to be utterly false, and accused her of being a charlatan, a false medium,{{efn|According to Randi, her "messages were often in the form of small bits of paper that floated down from the ceiling above her. She attracted many prominent persons to the movement by her performance of these effective diversions."{{sfn|Randi|2006}}}} evil, a spy for the Russians, a smoker of cannabis, a plagiarist, a spy for the English, a racist,{{sfn|Newman|2005}} and a falsifier of letters. Most of the accusations remain undocumented.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1925|pp=134&amp;ndash;139, etc.}}{{sfn|Harrison|1997}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Key to Theosophy,'' 2nd. ed. 1890, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times]]'' Edward Hower wrote, "Theosophical writers have defended her sources vehemently. Skeptics have painted her as a great [[fraud]]."{{sfn|Hower|1995}}

In the 1885 [[Hodgson Report]] to the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR), [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]] concluded that Blavatsky was a fraud.{{efn|According to Randi, the [[Society for Psychical Research|SPR]] exposed her techniques and equipment that "were shown to be the means by which she produced the written messages from her mahatmas, and it was revealed that she had deceived a disciple by hiring an actor wearing a dummy bearded head and flowing costume to impersonate" Koot Hoomi.{{sfn|Randi|2006}}}} However, in 1986, the [[Society for Psychical Research|SPR]] published a critique by handwriting expert [[Vernon Harrison]],{{sfn|Society for Psychical Research|1986}}{{sfn|Harrison|1997}} "which discredited crucial elements" of Hodgeson's case against Blavatsky, nevertheless, "Theosophists have overinterpreted this as complete vindication," wrote Johnson, "when in fact many questions raised by Hodgson remain unanswered."{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=3}}

[[René Guénon]] wrote a detailed critique of Theosophy entitled ''Theosophism: history of a pseudo-religion'' (1921), in which he claimed that Blavatsky had acquired all her knowledge from reading books, and not from any supernatural masters. Guenon pointed out that Blavatsky was a regular visitor to a library in New York, where she had easy access to the works of [[Jacob Boehme]], [[Eliphas Levi]], the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] and other [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] treatises. Guenon also wrote that Blavatsky had borrowed passages from extracts of the ''[[Kanjur]]'' and ''[[Tanjur]]'', translated by the eccentric orientalist [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]], published in 1836 in the twentieth volume of the ''Asiatic Researchers of Calcutta'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=René |last1= Guénon |translator= Alvin Moore Jr. |translator2= Cecil Bethell | title = Theosophy: history of a pseudo-religion | year=2004 | pages= 82–89 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7_WwVFntyFwC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K. Paul Johnson]] suggests in his book ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the [[Great White Brotherhood]]'' that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.{{sfn|Johnson|1994}}

The article "Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements" by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Paul. "Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements", ''The New York Times'', 5 October 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] in his book ''The skeptic's dictionary'' (2003) wrote that Blavatsky used trickery into deceiving others into thinking she had paranormal powers. Carroll wrote that Blavatsky had faked a materialization of a [[teacup]] and saucer as well as writing the messages from her masters herself.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd. ''The skeptic's dictionary'', 2003, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blavatsky's Theosophy connected to antisemitism, racism====
[[Jackson Spielvogel]] and David Redles of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance analyze Blavatsky's racial ideas in her book ''Secret Doctrine''. According to Spielvogel and Redles, Blavatsky labeled some races superior and others inferior. They clarify that Blavatsky did not advocate "domination of one race over another" and that she was against violence. They comment that Blavatsky's work "helped to foster antisemitism, which is perhaps one of the reasons her esoteric work was so rapidly accepted in German circles." They state Blavatsky "sharply differentiated Aryan and Jewish religion" and believed "The Aryans were the most spiritual people on earth." They quote Blavatsky's writing in ''Secret Doctrine'' as stating Aryans used religion as an "everlasting lodestar" in contrast to Judaism which Blavatsky claimed was based on "mere calculation" while characterizing it as a "religion of hate and malice toward everyone and everything outside itself."&lt;ref name = "Spielvogel"&gt;{{cite web

The first aim of the Theosophical Society she founded is "To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour", and her writings also include references emphasizing the unity of humanity: "all men have spiritually and physically the same origin" and that "mankind is essentially of one and the same essence".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1962|loc=Section 3}} Cranston quoted Blavatsky saying that in reality there is no inferior or low-grade races because all of it are one common humankind.{{sfn|Кранстон|1999|p=400}}

Blavatsky had posited that humanity evolved through a series of stages called [[Root Race]]s, the present, the Aryan, being the Fifth Root Race (of seven). The ''Root Races'' do not refer to ethnicities. They represent evolutionary stages the whole humanity is engaged in, each new Root Race being more advanced than the previous one. She taught that the earlier stage of evolution took place in [[Atlantis]] during the Fourth Root-Race. The Aryan Root Race was then only one more step in the evolutionary progression, to be eventually superseded by a more spiritual Root Race, the Sixth.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky 1888.

Regarding the concept of [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] as defined – in a comparatively more limited manner – by [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and other disciplines, Blavatsky did not encourage superiority by any person or group, promoting the idea of the common origin and destiny of all humanity, and establishing the principle of universal brotherhood as the First Object of the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky 1889. [http://theosophy.org/Blavatsky/Key%20to%20Theosophy/aKEY.htm#P39 "The Objects of the Society"] pp. 39–41. [[Wheaton, Maryland]]: Theosophy Library Online. Retrieved 2011-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt; She also proclaimed religious tolerance and inclusiveness stating, "Theosophists, collectively, respect the [[Bible]] as much as they do the sacred scriptures of other people, finding in it the same eternal truths as in the [[Vedas]], the [[Zend-Avesta]], the [[Tripitaka]]s, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky 1966 [http://www.katinkahesselink.net/blavatsky/articles/v12/y1890_039.htm "Neo-Buddhism"] pp. 478–511 [context at p. 341].

Retrieved 2011-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Austrian German|Austrian/German]] ultra-nationalist [[Guido von List]] and his followers such as [[Lanz von Liebenfels]], later selectively mixed parts of Blavatsky's occult philosophy with [[nationalist]]ic and [[fascist]] ideas; this system of thought became known as [[Ariosophy]]. Some researchers, tracing the links between Ariosophy and Theosophy, stated that the latter relies mostly on "intellectual expositions of racial evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hitler's Racial Ideology: Content and Occult Sources.|journal=[[Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual]]|year=1986|first=Jackson|last=Spielvogel|author2=David Redles |volume=3|at=Chapter 9|issn=0741-8450|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&amp;b=395043|accessdate=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However in ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'', Blavatsky had stated that "The Society is a philanthropic and scientific body for the propagation of the idea of brotherhood on ''practical'' instead of ''theoretical'' lines."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky 1889 [http://theosophy.org/Blavatsky/Key%20to%20Theosophy/aKEY.htm#P16 "What the Modern Theosophical Society is not"] pp. 16–20 [context at p. 19.

'''Torma''' (Skt: Balingta, Tib: Tor-ma, Wylie: gtor ma) are figures made mostly of flour and butter used in tantric rituals or as offerings in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. They may be dyed in different colors, often with white or red for the main body of the torma. They are made in specific shapes based on their purpose, usually conical in form. A very large, central shrine torma may be constructed for festivals, though typically they are small and placed directly on a shrine, on a plate, mounted on leather&lt;ref&gt;[http://tibet.prm.ox.ac.uk/glossary.php The Tibet Album Glossary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701071820/http://tibet.prm.ox.ac.uk/glossary.php |date=2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or held on a special base like a skull.&lt;ref&gt;Beer (2003) pp. 212-220&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The tradition of using offering cakes pre-dates Tibetan Buddhism, though traditional Indian offering cakes &amp;mdash; called ''bali''&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul (2002) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 1998 p. 129"&gt;Kongtrul (1998) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; or ''balingha''&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 1998 p. 199"&gt;Kongtrul (1998) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sanskrit]] &amp;mdash; are flat instead of conical.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1996) p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan term comes from the root ''gtor-ba'' which means to "cast away, break up, or scatter". This implies both a sense of offering and of letting go or non-attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Beer (2003) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
Tormas have different uses. Some are created and placed on shrines for ceremonies or to represent deities. Others are used in feast practice and consumed by practitioners during the practice. Others are made to appease spirits, accumulate merit, or remove obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu Rinpoche (2004) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly made of barley flour and butter, but traditionally other ingredients such as egg, milk, sugar, honey, and even meat may be included depending upon the purpose of the torma.&lt;ref&gt;Beer (2003) pp. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deity tormas ===
Deity tormas (Wylie: rten gtor) are kept on the shrine, and represent a particular [[Vajrayana|tantric]] deity.&lt;ref name="Padmasambhava 2004 p. 245-246"&gt;Padmasambhava (2004) p. 245-246&lt;/ref&gt; These tormas vary in complexity from a very simple cone painted white for peaceful deities like [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and [[Avalokiteshvara]], to very complex designs for semi-wrathful deities like [[Vajrayogini]] and [[Chakrasamvara]].&lt;ref&gt;Beer (2003) pp. 213-214&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food tormas ===
Food tormas (Wylie: skang gtor) are used in feast practices and are consumed partially by practitioners during the feast, with leftovers (Wylie: dme gtor) offered to lower beings after being blessed.&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul (1998) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;  In some traditions, food tormas are now made with more contemporary ingredients whereas others stay faithful to the barley flour tradition.

=== Offering tormas ===
Offering tormas may be made for and offered to deities (Wylie: sgrub gtor / mchod gtor), to Dharma Protectors, to obstructing spirits, or to other lower beings. Torma for obstructing spirits are called ''gektor''.&lt;ref name="Padmasambhava 2004 p. 245-246"/&gt;

=== Medicinal torma ===
A torma may be used in [[Traditional Tibetan medicine|Tibetan medicine]] to extract an illness from a patient as a cure. The torma is then cast away.&lt;ref&gt;Beer (2003) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Captured torma ===
A ''captured'' torma (Wylie: gta' gtor) may be used to speed completion of activities, by planning to offer the torma at the completion of the activity thereby encouraging successful activity.&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 1998 p. 199"/&gt;

=== Inner, secret and very secret torma ===
Practicing meditation with deity visualization is considered a form of torma offering, though no physical cake is created and then offered. Similarly, offering one's internal emotional and mental experiences and experience of suchness are non-physical forms of torma offerings.&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 1998 p. 129"/&gt;

[[File:ULT Logo.jpg|ULT Logo|thumb|right|United Lodge of Theosophists Logo]]
The '''United Lodge of Theosophists''' or '''ULT''' is an informal and wholly voluntary association of ''students'' of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. It was founded in 1909, mainly through the efforts of [[Robert Crosbie]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002}} The first ''parent lodge'' of the ULT was started in Los Angeles by Robert Crosbie and seven other associates through the adoption of its [http://www.ultindia.org/declaration.html Declaration] on February 18, 1909.{{sfn|SharmaSharma|2004}} Owing largely to the revival efforts of [[B.P. Wadia]] {{sfn|Lewis|2002}} after Crosbie's death, there are currently about twenty active lodges spread all over the world.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=177}} The ULT is considered to be part of the ''second generation'' {{sfn|HammerRothstein|2013}} or the ''third section'' {{sfn|SharmaSharma|2004}} of the [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical Movement]] started in 1875 by [[H.P. Blavatsky]] in New York. Presently, it is also one of the existing four main "''branches''" of the original Theosophical Movement.{{sfn|Akman|2015}} The following founding principles {{sfn|Crosbie|1945}} when taken as a whole, sets apart the ULT from the other Theosophical Organizations:
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
 | Recognition of [[W.Q. Judge]] as H.P. Blavatsky's colleague and co-worker from the beginning and hence as one of the original founders of the Theosophical Movement
 | Exclusive adherence to the unaltered works of H.P. Blavatsky and W.Q. Judge along with only those other works that are philosophically in consonance with the aforementioned
 | Rejection of any other "authorities" in the form of "leaders" or "teachers" and reference to all of its associates as "students" with emphasis on self-reliance
 | Absence of organizational elements such as constitution, by-laws or officers and complete reliance on the "similarity of aim, purpose and teaching," as the only basis of unity
 | Anonymity of living persons who write on behalf of ULT to protect against exaltation of personalities and self-advertising
}}

ULT Los Angeles publishes the [http://theosophycompany.org/pubs.html ''Theosophy Magazine''] which was started by Robert Crosbie in 1912. It was the revival of an earlier periodical called ''The Path'' that was edited by W.Q. Judge.{{sfn|Kuhn|1930}} ULT India publishes the ''[[Theosophical Movement Magazine]]'', founded under B.P. Wadia in 1930 in Mumbai. ULT Santa Barbara publishes a quarterly periodical called [http://www.theosophysb.org/site/publications.html Vidya], and uses [http://www.concordgrovepress.org Concord Grove Press] to publish theosophical texts including a pamphlet series on themes from ''The Secret Doctrine''. [http://www.Theosophical_Society.org/ The Theosophy Company] was registered in 1925 on behalf of ULT as a fiduciary agent {{sfn|Lewis|2002}} and an eleemosynary, non-profit corporation to publish photographic facsimile of the Original Editions of books by H.P. Blavatsky and W.Q. Judge.

== History ==
[[File:Ult-la.png|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of Theosophy Hall - United Lodge of Theosophists, Los Angeles]]
The history of ULT began with Robert Crosbie coming in contact with H.P. Blavatsky in 1887 and his subsequent association with the [[Theosophical Society]] or TS in Boston. Based on H.P. Blavatsky's instructions, he placed himself under the direct guidance of W.Q. Judge.{{sfn|SharmaSharma|2004}} Following the death of the original founders of the movement, Robert Crosbie was witness to the ensuing rivalries around "leadership", "authority" and "succession" surrounding [[Katherine Tingley]], who headed the American section and [[Annie Besant]], who headed the international section from India.{{sfn|MeltonBaumann|2010}} Initially, Robert Crosbie gave his support to Katherine Tingley and went to Point Loma in 1900 to be of assistance there. However, by 1904, he felt the original teachings of Theosophy were almost completely eclipsed by Katherine Tingley's sensational programs.{{sfn|Theosophical_Movement|1951}} Convinced that further effort was futile, he quietly left Point Loma and moved to Los Angeles. By February 1909, he had gathered around him seven individuals as part of a study group, four of whom were new to Theosophy. This nucleus, under Robert Crosbie's guidance, set to the task of restoring Theosophy along the original lines of its founders without organizational distractions.{{sfn|SharmaSharma|2004}} In the meantime, the original 1888 version of [[The Secret Doctrine]] was out of print and replaced by Annie Besant's "Third and Revised Edition". This edition was found to contain tens of thousands of alterations and major distortions.{{sfn|Akman|2015}} This and other material which diverged significantly from H.P. Blavatsky's original presentation was denominated [[Neo-Theosophy]]. Robert Crosbie denounced Neo-Theosophy and considered it along with other leadership claims and rivalries in the Theosophical Society to be the result of the accentuation of ''personality'', in the Theosophical sense of the lower or illusionary self.{{sfn|Crosbie|1945}} Hence the Declaration of the ULT was drawn to emphasize an ''impersonal'', self-reliant, non-hierarchical, non-organizational spirit and loyalty to the original founders and their ''unaltered'' message.

In November 1919, five months after Robert Crosbie's death, [[B.P Wadia]], a predominant member of the Theosophical Society Adyar visited America and happened to come across ULT Los Angeles. There he discovered the works of W.Q. Judge who was considered a renegade by the Theosophical Society under Annie Besant and [[Col. Olcott]].{{sfn|Kuhn|1930}} Furthermore, he found the reformation he was seeking of the Theosophical Society in ULT's Declaration of purpose and its mission of "pure Theosophy" without organizational distractions. He then went back to India with the hope of changing the attitude of the leaders of the Theosophical Society, to return to the original teachings, set right the wrong that was done to W.Q. Judge and mend the schism in the Theosophical Movement.{{sfn|Kell|1998}} Finding that his efforts were unsuccessful, he resigned from the Theosophical Society on 18 July 1922 {{snf|Wadia|1922}} and joined the ULT. Between 1922 and 1928 he stayed in America and founded ULT lodges in New York, Washington D.C and Philadelphia. And on his return trip to India via Europe, he established ULT lodges in Antwerp, Amsterdam, London and Paris. Back in India, he started ULT lodges in Mumbai and Bengaluru.{{sfn|Lewis|2002}}

{{Chinese name|[[Wang (surname)|Wang]]}}
{{Taoism}}

'''Wang Chongyang''' (11 January 1113 – 22 January 1170; [[Chinese calendar]]: 22nd day, 12th month, 2nd year, Zhenghe era in the reign of [[Emperor Huizong of Song]] - 4th day, 1st month, 10th year, Dading era in the reign of [[Emperor Shizong of Jin]])&lt;ref&gt;宋徽宗政和二年十二月廿二 – 金世宗大定十年正月初四&lt;/ref&gt; was a Chinese [[Taoism|Taoist]] and one of the founders of the [[Quanzhen School]] in the 12th century during the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] (1115–1234). He was one of the Five Northern Patriarchs of Quanzhen. He also appears as a character in works of ''[[wuxia]]'' fiction.

==Name==
* [[Family name]]: Wang (王)
* [[Given name]]s: ''Zhongfu'' (中孚); ''Dewei'' (德威); ''Zhe'' (喆)
* [[Courtesy name]]s: ''Yunqing'' (允卿); ''Shixiong'' (世雄); ''Zhiming'' (知明)
* [[Art name|Pseudonym]]: ''Chongyangzi'' (重陽子)

==Life==
Wang was born with his birth name as "Zhongfu" in a wealthy family in 1113. He was educated in Chinese classics and martial arts.

Wang intended to start a rebellion against the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin dynasty]], which conquered northern China in the [[Jin–Song Wars]].&lt;ref name=tao107&gt;Jing-shen Tao, "The Jurchen in Twelfth-Century China". University of Washington Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-295-95514-7}}. Pages 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, in the summer of 1159 when he was 48, he met three Taoist immortals in a tavern, [[Zhongli Quan]], [[Lü Dongbin]], and [[Liu Haichan]]. They trained him in secret forms of Taoism. He changed his name to "Zhe" and adopted the Taoist name "Chongyang".

In 1160, Wang met one of the immortals again and was provided with a set of written instructions called "Ganshui Xianyuan Lu". Those written instructions included the names of two men who would later become his disciples ([[Ma Yu]] and [[Tan Chuduan]]). Wang built a tomb for himself near [[Mount Zhongnan]] and called it "Tomb of the Living Dead". He lived in it for three years.

At the end of the three years, Wang filled the tomb with earth and built a hut on top of it and called it "Complete Perfection Hut". He spent the next four years in the hut studying Taoism and imparting his knowledge to others. During that time, he met Tan Chuduan, who became his disciple after he cured Tan from illness. [[Qiu Chuji]] and Tan traveled around the local towns and villages with Wang and founded five Taoist congregations. Wang's teachings were referred to the "Teachings of the Complete Perfection" (after the hut) and his branch of Taoism became known as the [[Quanzhen School]].

In 1167, Wang burnt down the hut and travelled east to [[Shandong]], where he met Ma Yu and Ma's wife, [[Sun Bu'er]]. They became his disciples as well. He accepted a total of seven disciples who later became known as "Seven Masters of Quanzhen" or "Seven Elders of Quanzhen". They are also called the "Seven Immortals" or "Seven Perfected Beings".

In 1187, [[Emperor Shizong of Jin]] summoned Wang's disciple [[Wang Chuyi]] (and, according to some sources, also [[Qiu Chuji]]) to preach in his inner palace. Later, he requested the presence of Wang Chuyi at his deathbed.&lt;ref name=tao107/&gt; Shizong's successor, [[Emperor Zhangzong of Jin|Emperor Zhangzong]], banned the teaching of Quanzhen Taoism. He considered them as causing heretical and detrimental to society;&lt;ref name=tao107/&gt;He converted to Quanzhen's teachings later and let Wang Chuyi stay in Yanjing (present-day [[Beijing]]) for a year.&lt;ref name=tao107/&gt; Shizong's grandson [[Wanyan Shou]] later wrote a biography for Wang Chongyang.&lt;ref name=tao107/&gt;

He was immortalized in the [[Longmen Grottoes]].

==Writings==
Wang was the author of many poems of Taoist instruction. According to legend, Liu Chuxuan became a follower of Wang after reading one of Wang's poems.

Wang's writings include:
*"An Anthology of Complete Perfection by Chongyang" (''Chongyang Quanzhen Ji'')
*"Chongyang's Anthology on Teaching Transformation" (''Chongyang Jiaohua Ji'')
*"Chongyang's Anthology of the Ten Transformations by Dividing Pears" (''Chongyang fenli shihua ji'') (The phrase "to divide a pear" is a pun for "to separate," these were writings intended to convince Ma Yu and Sun Bu'er to separate in order to better cultivate the Dao.)

==Disciples==
[[Image:Changchun-Temple-Master-and-disciples-painting-0316.jpg|thumb|Wang Chongyang and his seven disciples, depicted in Changchun Temple, [[Wuhan]]]]

The most notable ones among Wang's seven disciples were [[Sun Bu'er]] and [[Qiu Chuji]]. Sun's husband, Ma Yu, was one of the seven, while she became an important role model for female Taoists. Ma Yu later succeeded Wang as the leader of the Quanzhen School.

Qiu Chuji gained the favour of [[Genghis Khan]] and founded the [[White Cloud Monastery]] in [[Beijing]]. Genghis Khan granted tax-exempt status to all Quanzhen schools and placed Qiu in charge of all religions in China.

Each of the seven disciples founded his or her own lineage of Quanzhen Taoism. They are as follows:
# Ma Yu (馬鈺) founded the Yuxian lineage (Meeting the Immortals)
# Tan Chuduan (譚處端) founded the Nanwu lineage (Southern Void)
# Liu Chuxuan (劉處玄) founded the Suishan lineage (Mount Sui)
# [[Qiu Chuji]] (丘處機) founded the Longmen lineage (Dragon Gate)
# Wang Chuyi (王處一) founded the Yushan lineage (Mount Yu)
# Hao Datong (郝大通) founded the Huashan lineage ([[Mount Hua]])
# [[Sun Bu'er]] (孫不二) founded the Qingjing lineage (Clarity and Stillness)

Wang is mentioned by name in the [[wuxia]] novel ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes]]'', by [[Jin Yong]]. In the first novel, he was the "Central Divine" (中神通) of the Five Greats (五絕), the top five champions of the first martial arts contest on [[Mount Hua]]. He is depicted as a patriotic Taoist of the predominantly [[Han Chinese]] society of the [[Song dynasty|Song Empire]], and seeks to protect his people from the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Empire]]'s [[Jin–Song Wars|invasion of northern China]]. He founds the [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Sect]], based in Chongyang Palace on [[Mount Zhongnan]], with the aim of grooming and nurturing Taoists, who are trained in martial arts, to serve the country and uphold justice. After his death, his seven apprentices, known as the "Seven Immortals of Quanzhen", inherit his legacy and promote Quanzhen to become one of the leading orthodox sects in the ''[[jianghu]]'' (martial artists' community).

The sequel provides a glimpse into Wang's romance with Lin Chaoying, the founder of the [[Ancient Tomb Sect]]. In his early life, Wang had a tomb built at Mount Zhongnan and intended it to serve as a secret base of operations for the battles against the Jurchens. He lost to Lin in a martial arts contest and had to keep his promise to give the tomb to her and become a Taoist. Wang and Lin remain rivals for the rest of their lives, constantly innovating new martial arts techniques to defeat each other. However, [[Yang Guo]] and [[Xiaolongnü]] discover later that Lin apparently hates Wang but actually still loves him. This is evident from the fact that although Lin's martial arts seem to counter Wang's, they actually complement his skills.

In the [[manhua]] series ''[[Oriental Heroes]]'' by Hong Kong artist [[Wong Yuk-long]], Wang Chongyang is noted as the creator of the 'Nine Solar Art'.

'''''We Have a Pope''''' (original title: '''''Habemus Papam''''') is a 2011 Italian-French comedy-drama film directed by [[Nanni Moretti]] and starring [[Michel Piccoli]] and Moretti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1908215017 |page= 153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original title is Latin for "We have a pope", the phrase used upon the [[Habemus Papam|announcement of a new pope]]. The story revolves around a cardinal who, against his wishes, is elected [[pope]]. A psychoanalyst is called in to help the pope overcome his panic.&lt;ref name=popesuffers /&gt; The film premiered in Italy in April 2011 and played in competition at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival|64th Cannes Film Festival]].

==Plot==
On the death of the pope, the [[conclave]] meets in [[Rome]]. Early ballots end with black smoke, since none of the main candidates reaches the quorum. After several rounds of voting, Cardinal Melville is elected, though he had not previously been considered a frontrunner.

At the moment of the public announcement, with the faithful are gathered in [[St. Peter's Square]] and the cardinal proto-deacon ready to announce the name of the new pope, the newly elected pope has a panic attack and fails to appear on the balcony.

The spokesman of the [[Holy See]] evades questions from the press and the curiosity of the outside world by reporting that the new pontiff felt the need to sequester himself in prayer and reflection before taking office, and by explaining that he will make his official appearance within a few hours. This does not happen.

In accordance with the laws of the Church, until the identity of the new pope is announced publicly, the ceremony of election is not over and no one in the conclave can leave the Vatican.

The [[College of Cardinals]], deeply concerned by the crisis and the depression from which the new pope seems to be suffering, calls in the psychoanalyst Professor Brezzi (whose role is played by director Nanni Moretti). The cardinals react to the psychoanalyst with some suspicion, but still allow him to examine the new pope. Brezzi, in the presence of the cardinals, tries to initiate a psychotherapy session which, however, fails to reveal anything to explain the depression and helplessness that plague the pontiff.

Brezzi reveals that his ex-wife is also a psychoanalyst and the newly elected pope is taken secretly to see her, but escapes his minders and runs away during a walk. Unaware of his absence, the cardinals kill time by playing games, ranging from cards to an international volleyball tournament organized by Brezzi.

The spokesman makes everyone believe that the Pope is in his quarters in prayer, and eventually the cardinals find Melville and give him another chance to announce his acceptance. Melville comes out onto the balcony claiming "I am not the leader you need", asks the crowd to pray "for  what he is about to do", and than retreats back into St. Peter's.

''We Have a Pope'' was announced in May 2009 as a co-production between Sacher Film, [[RAI|Rai Cinema]] and the French company Le Pacte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Marco|first=Camillo de|date=2009-05-21|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?lang=en&amp;documentID=108753|title=Le Pacte re-teams with Moretti for ''Abbiamo il Papa''|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fandango joined as a co-producer later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Marco|first=Camillo de|date=2009-12-15|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?lang=en&amp;documentID=116319|title=Piccoli to play Pope for Moretti|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production involved a budget of eight million euro.&lt;ref name=popesuffers&gt;{{Cite web|last=Scarpa|first=Vittoria|date=2011-04-14|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?treeID=850&amp;documentID=201529|title=Moretti's ''Pope'' suffers from stress|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; French actor [[Michel Piccoli]] was cast in the leading role after auditioning six scenes in Italian in August 2009. The character's name, Melville, was inspired by the French filmmaker [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]. Some of the minor characters were played by members of the production team, whom Moretti found suitable for the roles when working on the set.&lt;ref name=pressconf /&gt;

Principal photography started 1 February 2010 and was finished by the end of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenbase.screendaily.com/films/276|title=We Have A Pope (Habemus Papam)|work=Screenbase|publisher=[[Screen International]]|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio constructions at the [[Cinecittà]] studios in Rome included replicas of the [[Sala Regia (Vatican)|Sala Regia]] and the [[Sistine Chapel]]. Other scenes were shot in the [[Palazzo Farnese]] and [[Villa Medici]], which otherwise house the French embassy and the [[French Academy in Rome]], respectively.&lt;ref name=popesuffers /&gt;

==Themes==

===Portrayal of the conclave proceedings===
The film reveals the overwhelming reluctance of a pope-elect to assent to his election as Supreme Pontiff. Director Nanni Moretti explained his aim with the film at the press conference following the press screening in Rome: "I wanted to depict a fragile man, Cardinal Melville, who feels inadequate in the face of power and the role he's called to fill ... I think this feeling of inadequacy happens to all cardinals elected Pope, or at least that's what they say."&lt;ref name=pressconf&gt;{{Cite web|last=Scarpa|first=Vittoria|date=2011-04-21|url=http://cineuropa.org/interview.aspx?lang=en&amp;documentID=202248|title=Interview with Nanni Moretti|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure of [[papal conclave]] requires a two-thirds supermajority vote to elect a new pope.&lt;ref name="BXVI-MP"&gt;Benedict XVI (11 June 2007). [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070611_de-electione_lt.html De aliquibus mutationibus in normis de electione Romani Pontificis] (in Latin). ''[[Motu proprio]]''. Vatican City: Vatican Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, when the Cardinal Dean asks the pope-elect if he accepts his election, the Pope-elect is free to decline, though typically Cardinals who intend to refuse their election explicitly state this to their colleagues before a two-thirds majority is reached. The Pope-elect immediately enters office and ends the conclave once he accepts his election. All ceremonies regarding his installation are purely ceremonial.

The film was released in Italy on 15 April 2011 through 01 Distribution in collaboration with Sacher Distribuzione. It was launched on 460 screens.&lt;ref name=popesuffers /&gt; With 1,298,524 euro in revenues during the first weekend, the film entered the Italian box-office chart as number two, behind the American film ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' which premiered simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/italy/?yr=2011&amp;wk=15&amp;p=.htm|title=Italy Box Office: April 15–17, 2011|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''We Have a Pope'' showed In Competition at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Cannes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/58041.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Official Selection |accessdate=2011-04-14|work=Cannes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In France Les ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' listed the film as the best picture of the year 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Cahiers du cinema|url=https://www.cahiersducinema.com/produit/top-ten-2011|title=Top Ten 2011, Décembre 2011 n°673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Young of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "a well-written, surprisingly mainstream comedy" and noted how it was less political than earlier works by Moretti, such as ''[[The Mass Is Ended]]'' and ''[[Il caimano|The Caiman]]'': "Here the storyteller overpowers the moralist in every sense. Not a hint of clerical sex scandals clouds the surreal image of frolicking white-haired Cardinals; the most critical line in the film suggests the Church needs a leader who will bring great change, but even that plays as an offhand remark." Young went on to compliment the production design and cinematography, and called Moretti "one of the most creative filmmakers working in Italy". However, Young wrote, "the finale is a let-down, leaving the feeling of an artist paralyzed by his own perfectionism and his desperate search for originality at all costs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Young|first=Deborah|date=2011-04-15|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/we-have-a-pope-film-179046|title=We Have a Pope: Film Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions from the Roman Catholic community were mixed. Vatican correspondent Salvatore Izzo called for a boycott of the film in the newspaper ''[[Avvenire]]'', owned by the [[Italian Episcopal Conference]]. Izzo wrote: "We shouldn't touch the pope&amp;nbsp;– the rock on which Jesus founded his Church." He continued: "Why should we support financially that which offends our religion?"&lt;ref name=stirs&gt;{{Cite web|last=Vaissiere|first=Jean-Louis de la|date=2011-04-19|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jjQHJ9Jf4SUEde2iCKq3y02-1c1g?docId=CNG.2aa1ba4263f92ab3400d617f4effc7f9.e1|title=AFP: Pope's shrink film stirs controversy in Italy|work=[[Google News]]|accessdate=2011-04-21&lt;!-- archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5y6rrtPbR --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vatican Radio]] commented on the film and found it to contain "no irony, no caricature" of the pope.&lt;ref name=stirs /&gt; Regarding the prospect of an official condemnation of the film from church authorities, [[Sandro Magister]], an Italian journalist specialising in Vatican issues, said: "If there were to be one, it would only help the producer. He would be very happy with a polemic that is completely without foundation."&lt;ref name=stirs /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">'''Chen Chien Ming''' ({{zh|t=陳健民|p=Chén Jiànmín}}; 1906–1987), also known as '''Yogi C. M. Chen''' or simply as '''Yogi Chen''', was a Chinese hermit who lived in [[Kalimpong]], [[India]], from 1947 until 1972, when he moved to the [[United States]], where he lived for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Kulananda | last=Dharmachari | year=2000 | title=Teachers of enlightenment: the refuge tree of the Western Buddhist Order | publisher=Windhorse Publications | isbn=1-899579-25-7 | page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ole Nydahl, Chen had, in his youth in China, been terrified of death and had at first practiced [[Taoist]] life-extending exercises. Later he turned to Buddhism and, in search of teachings, went to Tibet, where he spent several years living in a cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Lama Ole | last=Nydahl | year=1985 | title=Entering the Diamond Way: Tibetan Buddhism Meets The West | publisher=Blue Dolphin | isbn=978-0-931892-03-5 | pages=126–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sangharakshita]] regarded Chen as one of his teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Urgyen | last=Sangharakshita | year=2002 | title=Moving Against the Stream: The Birth of a New Buddhist Movement | publisher=Windhorse Publications | isbn=978-1-899579-11-2 | page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together with [[Khantipalo]] helped him compile ''Buddhist Meditation, Systematic and Practical''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=Chien Ming | last1=Chen | first2=Bhikkhu | last2=Khantipalo | year=1983 | title=Buddhist Meditation, Systematic and Practical (Volume 42 of Hsientai fohsüeh tahsi) | publisher=Mile chʻupanshe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sangharakshita and Khantipalo describe Chen as "eccentric."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=J.O. | last=Mallander | year=1995 | title=In the Realm of the Lotus: A Conversation About Art, Beauty and the Spiritual Life | publisher=Windhorse Publications | isbn=978-0-904766-72-1 | page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Khantipalo | last=Lawrence | year=2002 | title=Noble friendship: travels of a Buddhist monk | publisher=Windhorse Publications | isbn=1-899579-46-X | page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;
