The '''1928 International Columbia Graphophone Competition''' was a competition part-sponsored by the Columbia Record Company in honour of the [[centenary]] of the death of [[Franz Schubert]]. Its original aim was to encourage composers to produce completions of Schubert's [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|'Unfinished' Symphony]] but the rules were modified several times to allow the submission of original symphonic works. Preliminary rounds were judged on a country or area basis, and the winning works at this level were then forwarded to the final judging for the world prize, which took place in [[Vienna]]. Notable composers who gained prizes in the country categories included [[Havergal Brian]], [[Czesław Marek]] and [[Franz Schmidt]], but the overall prize, after a wrangle among the judges, was awarded to the Swedish composer [[Kurt Atterberg]] for his Sixth Symphony.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Inception and changing rules==
Organized jointly by the [[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]] in Vienna and the Columbia Graphophone Company of Britain and America, the competition was originally announced on 26 June 1927 as a contest for composers from around the world to complete Schubert's Symphony in B minor, D. 759 (the ''Unfinished''). Between July 1927 and February 1928 the rules of entry were modified several times to allow the submission of original works rather than a completion of Schubert, and also to permit the use, if prospective completers wished, of Schubert's own sketches for the third movement of the ''Unfinished''. Those composers who wished to submit a completion of Schubert's work were to use an orchestra no larger than that already employed in the existing movements of the ''Unfinished''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} As far as the submission of individual works was concerned, in October 1927 the organizers stipulated that these should be 'in two movements, composed in the Romantic spirit that animates Schubert's music'.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
Only a few weeks later this formulation was changed to 'symphonic works in one or more movements, presented as an apotheosis of the lyrical genius of Schubert'; it was also suggested, though not stipulated, that there could be non-symphonic works, as long as these were sets of variations on Schubert themes, but all works had to be for orchestra. Later still, a further revision of the rules stated that 'the compositions, apart from faultless formal structure, must be marked by the predominance of a vigorous melodic content, and the number of instruments employed must not substantially exceed the measure established by the classical orchestras of Schubert's time'.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Submissions and Zone judging==
The contest was to be judged in two stages. "The World" (effectively Europe, the Americas, and the British Commonwealth) was divided into ten 'zones', each of which could award prizes for three works, the first prize being £150 sterling or $750, the second prize £50 or $250 and the third prize no money, but an 'honourable mention' (''hochste Anerkennung''). These 30 scores were then to be entered for the sole international first prize of £2,000 or $10,000, to be adjudicated in Vienna. The 'Zone' jurors, who judged the first stage, included such well-known personalities as [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Thomas Beecham]], [[Ottorino Respighi]], and [[Karol Szymanowski]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

As far as is known, despite the prestige of the competition, very few of the youngest generation of composers bothered to enter, especially those of a [[modernism|modernist]] persuasion. The terms of entry, and indeed the identity of many of the jurors, bespoke a highly conservative and traditionalist view of musical history. Nevertheless, several substantial figures of more senior generations participated in the competition, and not all their works were destined to be forgotten. At least 513 composers, and probably many more, submitted scores by the closing date.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} If the 30 or so winning entries in the first stage accurately reflect the proportion of original works to completions of Schubert, it would seem that about 20 per cent, i.e., something over 100 different "finishings" of the ''Unfinished'', were submitted. Among the remaining 80 per cent of entries - the original works - there was a tremendous diversity of approach and character, and many submitted scores that had only the most tenuous connexion with the ideals outlined in the conditions of entry.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Examples===
A full list of winners by zone is given by Paul Rapoport (see Sources, below). In the 'English' zone, for example, the first prize of £150 was divided between the composer-pianist [[Frank Merrick]] (who submitted a completion of the Schubert symphony) and [[John St. Anthony Johnson]], for a symphonic movement called ''Pax Vobiscum''.  The second prize went to the composer [[Havergal Brian]] for the orchestral movements from his [[Symphony No. 1 (Havergal Brian)|''Gothic Symphony'']]. (This symphony, which had evolved between 1919 and 1927, is famous for the gigantic orchestra and chorus employed in the choral finale that forms Part Two. It had clearly not been written as an entry for the competition, but as submitted by the composer, only the somewhat smaller manuscript for Part One, consisting of three more conventional orchestral movements, was deemed eligible to be adjudged as a stand-alone work.){{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In the Austrian section, the first prize was awarded to [[Franz Schmidt]] for his Third Symphony, the second to [[Hans Gál]] for his First Symphony and the third prize to a symphony by [[Moni Friedsohn]]. In the Scandinavian section, the first prize went to [[Kurt Atterberg]] of [[Sweden]] for his Sixth Symphony, the second to the Norwegian, [[Ludvig Irgens-Jensen]], for his orchestral [[Passacaglia]], and the third prize to a symphony by the Dane [[Jens Laursen Emborg]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Final Judging==

From 19–23 June 1928 the 30 winning scores from the ten national zones were evaluated in Vienna by the International jury. This body consisted of one delegate from each of the zones plus an eleventh juror appointed in Vienna. The chairman was [[Alexander Glazunov]]; he was assisted by such luminaries as [[Franco Alfano]], [[Alfred Bruneau]], [[Walter Damrosch]], [[Carl Nielsen]], [[Franz Schalk]], [[Max von Schillings]], and [[Donald Tovey]]. The Polish delegate was [[Emil Młynarski]]; the eleventh, Viennese, delegate was [[Guido Adler]]. Since the deliberations of the jury were never published, they have been the subject of much rumour. It was agreed that all the completions of Schubert's ''Unfinished'' should be ruled out and the judging devoted only to the original works. The sole international prize was awarded to the Sixth Symphony of [[Kurt Atterberg]]. This was also the only work to receive a recording, and it was eventually reviewed with a fair amount of derision by international critics as a particularly weak and derivative specimen of contemporary music. It is clear that Atterberg's symphony was in direct competition with two other scores, namely [[Franz Schmidt]]'s Third Symphony and [[Czesław Marek]]'s ''Sinfonia'', because both of these pieces - though they received no prize, no money and no recording - merited an 'honourable mention' in the final judgment. Other pieces may however have been involved in the final balance. Sources within the Columbia Graphophone company released unattributable stories to suggest that [[Havergal Brian]]'s ''Gothic'' Symphony, which Donald Tovey as British delegate certainly considered a masterpiece, was also evaluated, as well as a set of symphonic variations entitled ''Karma'' by the American [[Charles Haubiel]]. This account would square with a report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (29 November 1928) which suggested that the jury were divided on four scores which were considered outstanding but eventually rejected as ‘in a modernistic vein inappropriate to the occasion’{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, and that Atterberg's Symphony was awarded the prize as the best of the others, with (it seems) five jurors dissenting and the deadlock broken by the casting vote of Glazunov. Yet Atterberg's Symphony No. 6 - though hardly the equal of Marek's, or indeed Schmidt's or Brian's works as a feat of symphonic thinking - is by no means the mere pastiche that it was represented as in contemporary reviews; and one might have expected that its rather prominent vein of polytonality would have rendered it equally ‘inappropriate to the occasion’.{{POV statement|date=September 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''Arthur Furguson''' (1883&amp;ndash;1938) was (or may have been) a Scottish [[con artist]] who allegedly became known for "selling" English national monuments and other government property to visiting American tourists during the 1920s.

It is claimed that in the 1920s, Furguson sold monuments such as [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] (for the sum of £6,000), [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] (£1,000 for a down payment), and [[Buckingham Palace]] (£2,000 for a down payment) to American tourists. Furguson immigrated to the US in 1925. He sold the [[White House]] to a rancher on the [[hire purchase|installment plan]] for yearly payments of $100,000, and tried to sell the [[Statue of Liberty]] to a visiting Australian, who went to the police. Furguson was imprisoned and was released in 1930. He continued to defraud people in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] until his death in 1938.

However, according to author Dane Love, who profiled Furguson in his book ''The Man Who Sold Nelson's Column'', the existence of Furguson himself may be a hoax. Love attempted to trace contemporary records which would confirm the story, but found "[t]here was nothing about his arrest, his trial or his time in jail in New York. There's not even any trace of his grave in Los Angeles, where he supposedly died in 1938." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/tv-showbiz-news/entertainment-news/2009/02/08/tv-quiz-host-stephen-fry-duped-by-story-of-fictional-scots-conman-78057-21105696/ |title=TV quiz host Stephen Fry duped by story of fictional Scots conman - The Daily Record |publisher=Sundaymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known reference to Furguson dates from as recently as the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Egon Larsen|Larsen, Egon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6988">'''Brown envelope journalism''' (BEJ) is a practice whereby monetary inducement is given to journalists to make them write a positive story or kill a negative story.&lt;ref name="brown envelope"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iijsr.org/data/frontImages/gallery/16.pdf|title=BROWN ENVELOPE SYNDROME AND THE FUTURE OF JOURNALISM IN NIGERIA|author=Eke, Williams|work=International Interdisciplinary Journal of Scientific Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is derived from cash inducements hidden in brown envelopes and given to journalists during press briefings. While the true extent of BEJ practices worldwide is unknown, research literature has been concentrated in the South East and Asia and Eastern Europe regions, as well as Latin American and African regions in recent years. In 2010, the African Communication Research journal has received around 40 submissions of research articles centered around 10 Subsaharan African countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Origins==

The term "brown envelope" was first coined in 1994 the after the "cash-for-questions-affair" incident, a political scandal in the United Kingdom (UK). [[The Guardian]] alleged that the owner of Harrods department store, Mohammed Al Fayed, had paid a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons to ask a question using a brown colored envelope for the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/oct/20/conservatives.uk|title=Tory MPs were paid to plant questions says Harrods chief|last=Hencke|first=David|date=1994-10-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lodamo|first=Berhanu|last2=Skjerdal|first2=Terje|date=2009|title=Freebies and Brown Envelopes in Ethiopian Journalism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02560054.2009.9653399?journalCode=recq20|journal=Ecquid Novi: African Journalism Studies|volume=30|issue=2|pages=134–154|doi=10.1080/02560054.2009.9653399|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

BEJ is regarded as a common practice in Nigeria. Prior to the 1990s, most news publications were government owned. The Babangida regime (1985-1993) saw a rise of media activism, opposing militarised democratization and struggle for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adesoji|first=Abimbola O.|date=2006|title=Globalization of the media and the challenges of Democratisation in Nigeria.|url=https://www.atria.nl/ezines/web/Nebula/2009/No1/nobleworld/Adesoji.pdf|journal=Nebula|volume=3|issue=4|pages=38–50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early standing of journalism as noble resulted in a lack of law or regulations.&lt;ref&gt;file:///C:/Users/Proprio/Downloads/the-battle-for-professionalism-in-journalism-in-nigeria-amidst-unethical-practices-2165-7912-1000301.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One of the effects is that the [[Media of Nigeria|Nigerian media]] has become a thriving arena for sponsored stories. Journalists in Nigeria perceive BEJ practice to be unethical, and media regulatory bodies such as The Nigerian Union of Journalist (NUJ) apply a code of ethics to discourage the practice.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-31748257|title=Nigeria's 'brown envelope' journalism|author=BBC Africa|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
*Public relations (PR) – The practice of brown envelope journalism is sometimes described in Nigeria as PR or public relations by those who indulge in it. PR involves paying in advance for a newsworthy event to be reported by journalists.
*Token of appreciation or for transport – This is monetary inducement given to journalists to gain undue favor under the guise that the [[bribe]] giver appreciates the time and mileage the journalist spent on a story.
*''Kola'' refers to offering bribes to unethical journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Eke, Williams. p 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A cause of brown envelope journalism may be the poor remuneration of journalists. Many journalists' salaries are not paid on time and bosses sometimes justify this non payment by telling their employees to use the media platform to earn money.&lt;ref&gt;BBC&lt;/ref&gt; There are instances whereby magazines owe employees six months salary,&lt;ref name="Media project"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://themediaproject.org/article/nigerian-journalism-culture-brown-envelopes?page=full|title=Journalism vs. 'Brown Envelopes'|author=Shola  Oshunkeye|work=The Media Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; even when paid, many journalists still earn less than $3 per day and graduate journalist earn as little as $200 monthly. It may be difficult for journalist who are hungry or have families to feed to live on the salaries alone and neglect taking brown envelopes. In 2015, the Nigeria Union of Journalists demonstrated against ThisDay newspapers after salary payments were delayed for nine months.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/186261-journalists-protest-against-thisday-over-non-payment-of-salaries.html&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 survey study of journalists' perception on the causes of Brown Envelope Syndrome (BES) practices in Nigeria indicate that 6% of journalists interview associate poor remuneration as a cause of (BES), while 2% indicated delay in salary payments.&lt;ref&gt;file:///C:/Users/Proprio/Downloads/32-58-1-SM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause may be the influence of advertisers on the financial performance of media houses. Due to the revenues that accrue to media firms through [[advertisements]], the media houses are well aware of the interest of advertisers and consider those interests in the packaging of sensitive news.&lt;ref&gt;Eke, williams. p 152&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dele Olojede]]'s Next Newspapers stopped printing as a result of drop in revenues from advertisers. Next's newspaper's crusading stance on political issues and probe into the oil sector hurt its ad sales and paid [[Elite advertisement in Nigeria|salutatory praises on politicians]].&lt;ref name="Olojedet"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.afripol.org/afripol/item/374-next-a-pulitzer-winners-nigeria-newspaper-stops-printing.html?tmpl=component&amp;print=1|title=NEXT A Pulitzer winner's Nigeria newspaper stops printing|author=Ajon   Gambrell|work=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some broadcast television stations sponsored news programs can reach close to 50% of news stories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ec.ubi.pt/ec/03/html/omenugha-oji-news-commercialization.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The effect of this form of journalism is that there is a shift in journalism from being a [[fourth estate]] to a publicity seeking outlet available to the highest bidder; integrity, objectivity and balance is weakened as a result and news is commercialized. It also creates an avenue for publicity seeking journalists to write commentaries that is intended to address personalities and not sensitive issues. Hence the Nigerian media is weakened and inefficient and cannot function independently of politicians and businessmen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11689">All the limitations that reduce the range of financial contracts that agents can sign and/or that prevent them to be honored are called imperfections. These restrictions are more common in capital markets. There are three basic reasons for that: First, lenders do not have full information about the borrower, whether they have the capacity to pay back their debt and/or whether they are willing to pay ([[Information asymmetry|asymmetric information]]). Secondly, lender needs to trust the borrower to commit and to pay back his/her debt or there needs to be a third party to enforce the contract as it is more difficult to enforce contracts ex post (limited commitment). Finally, since the exchange does not happen at the same time, there is always room for renegotiation.

== Perfect capital markets ==

In perfect capital market case, assuming complete markets, perfect rationality of agents and under full information, the equilibrium occurs where the interest rates clear the market, with the supply of funds equal to the demand. This type of equilibrium is called [[Arrow-Debreu model|Arrow-Debreu]] equilibrium, which is defined as there is a set of prices (in this case interest rates) under which demand and supply of the market are equal to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Kenneth J. and Gerard Debreu (1954), "Existence of an Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy,"  Econometrica, Vol. 22, No. 3 (Jul., 1954), pp. 265–290.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, we can analyze the firm's investment decision and its owner's consumption/saving decision separately&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Irving (1930), "Theory of Interest: As determined by impatience to spend income and opportunity to invest it," New York: Kelley and Millman&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Fisher separation theorem]]). In addition to that, even in case of  [[bankruptcy]] risk, the resulting optimum choice of firm will be efficient as the interest rate increases to capture the bankruptcy risk. Therefore, the possibility of default of the borrower is not a main driving force that leads to imperfect capital markets.

== Asymmetric information ==
The main feature of financial markets that leads to imperfection is [[information asymmetry]] between borrowers and lenders. We see two main types of information asymmetries in [[capital markets]]:
* '''[[Adverse selection]]''': Adverse selection occurs before the signing of the [[contract]]. The lack of information occurs since the lenders do not have information about the type of borrowers, i.e. whether the borrower tends to engage in riskier projects or not. There is positive correlation between possibility of selecting "bad" types as the [[interest rate]] increases since it is more costly for safe borrowers than risky borrowers since the possibility of not paying back his/her debt for the risky one is relatively higher. In adverse selection, the borrower type is only known by the individual and occurs when there are no enough tools to screen the borrower types. One of the examples of screening is offering different types of funds having different interest rates and asking different amounts of collateral in order to reveal the information about the type of the borrower. If the borrower is a "bad" type, then he/she will choose the type of funds having higher interest rates and requesting lower amount of collateral.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph and Andrew Weiss (1981), “Credit Rationing in Markets with Imperfect Information,” American Economic Review, 71(3), pp. 393–410.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in real world there are many types of borrowers which we can not categorize with just "bad" and "good" types. For each characteristic of the borrower lender needs to increase the number of instruments to fully reveal the information about the type of the borrower. Hence, in real life it is not possible for lender to fully reveal the type of borrowers.
* '''[[Moral hazard]]''': The other type of asymmetric information is moral hazard which arises from the lack of information about the [[Ex post|ex-post]] behavior of the borrower. After signing the contract, the borrower will tend make riskier project since he does not take the full responsibility of the funds. As the interest rate increases, the possibility of the borrower to engage in riskier projects increases in order to increase the [[expected return]]. In general, it is assumed that the riskier projects have higher expected return.
* Other possibility that results from the lack of information about the behavior of the borrower is that when the borrower declares [[Default (finance)|default]], the lender does not know if it is really true or not and what the value of the project/firm is after the default. Hence, it incurs some cost to verify the default. Hence, this also hinders the equilibrium from being efficient as the [[Costly state verification|verification cost]] decreases the [[welfare]].

== Limited Commitment ==

Another important characteristic that yields imperfection is that exchange does not happen simultaneously in capital markets. The borrower gets his/her funds, but the lender must rely on the promises of the borrower. One of the conditions for imperfect capital markets is [[default risk]]. The borrower may declare [[bankruptcy]], and thus, may not pay the debt back. Hence, the borrower's promises, as well as the structure of the promises, are very important for the transaction to be realized. One of the options in dealing with the limited commitment problem is providing [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. The contract is formed such that in case of default, the lender has all/some rights to seize the collateral. This is called a [[secured loan]] in finance. However, it does not fully solve the problem because there are costs associated with seizing the pledged asset. One source of these costs is the money and time spent enforcing the contract.

Another reason for capital market imperfections associated with limited commitment is the ability of the borrower to renegotiate the terms of the contract ex post. Even though the contract is signed as a [[secured loan]], because of the enforcement costs, the lender never gets the full payment in case of default. Ex post, the borrower always has the option to offer more than the lender would get in case of default, but less than the full payment. That is why the [[incentive compatibility]] is needed to ensure binding contracts, in imperfect capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Jonathan, and Tim Worrall. "Self-Enforcing Wage Contracts." Review of Economic Studies 55, no. 184 (October 1988): 541.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation with incomplete markets ==
The other feature of the capital market leading to imperfections is that credit is not a [[homogeneous]] good. It is a different good in different states of world in different times and even given different people. In an idealized "perfect" market, economists expect the market to "achieve every desired exchange for homogeneous goods when there is only one price".&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, George J. (1967), "Imperfections in the Capital Market." Journal of Political Economy, 75(3), pp. 287–292.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that, to have a perfect capital market, every agent may exchange funds at the existing single interest rate for each type of fund. However, in reality we do not have that many different types of credit/funds for each different states of world to have [[complete market]].

== Consequences of imperfections in capital markets ==

With perfect information as the interest rate increases, expected return to the lender increases as the lender charges the borrower more for the lending service. However, with imperfect information there is also an indirect opposite effect. As the interest rate rises, the possibility of selecting riskier borrowers increases as the cost increases less for them as they may not pay it back. Hence, as the interest rate goes up, the return to the lender decreases only considering the [[adverse selection]] effect. Considering these two opposite effects, the lender may determine the interest rate to maximize the [[rate of return]] so it does not necessarily clear the market. In that situation, some individuals can not obtain any credit at the existing market interest rate although they are willingly to pay the [[market value]]. Hence, we see [[credit rationing]] as a result of imperfection in capital markets.

[[Credit rationing]] does not just caused from asymmetric information but also from limited enforcement in case of default. There are also costs used for law enforcement in order to get back the funds and in most of the case there is also possibility of not taking back at all if it was an unsecured loan. The problem of [[credit rationing]] arises most if the creditor does not have anything to provide as collateral. Even if he/she is a trustworthy person and would use the funds for good investment project and able to pay back his/her debt, the lender may not lend him/her so it leads to inefficient allocation of resources.

In macroeconomic perspective one of the consequences of the imperfect capital markets is insufficient investment.&lt;ref&gt;JAFFEE, D . M. and F.  MODIGLIANI, (1969), "A Theory and Test of Credit Rationing," American Economic Review, 59, 850–872.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of the time firms finance their investment from credit markets, lack of supply of funds leads to insufficient amount of investment causing inefficient allocation of funds in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Pratap, Sangeeta  and Silvio Rendon, 2003. "Firm Investment in Imperfect Capital Markets: A Structural Estimation," Review of Economic Dynamics, vol. 6(3), pages 513–545.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it was true that every agent could borrow at the amount they were willing to, we could not have reached the efficient allocation because of the high market interest rate causing from the cost of screening and monitoring of the banks.

Based on the fact that in real world the capital markets are far from being perfect, we can clearly say that market clearing is a very specific result which may not hold in general.&lt;ref&gt;Korinek, A. (2011), Lecture notes of Macroeconomics of Imperfect Capital Markets, University of Maryland&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imperfections in international capital markets ==

Enforcement of the contract is particularly difficult in an international set up. It is hard for a [[creditor]] to impose [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] to a country that defaults. Hence, it is a much deeper problem considering the consequences of imperfections in [[international capital markets]].&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Jonathan &amp; Mark Gersovitz, 1981. "Debt with Potential Repudiation: Theoretical and Empirical Analysis," Review of Economic Studies, Blackwell Publishing, vol. 48(2), pages 289–309&lt;/ref&gt; It may highly reduce the country's ability to extract financial resources on international basis. the most fundamental reason is the [[Sovereign debt|sovereign risk]] that causes from the lack of a supranational legal authority, capable of enforcing contracts across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Obstfeld, M. &amp; K. Rogoff (1996), "Foundations of International Macroeconomics", MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; The main results of imperfect international capital markets are similar to domestic ones: [[risk]] and insufficient level of [[investment]]. Since the [[Inefficient markets|inefficiency of the economy]] in terms of investment is also related to the [[economic growth]] of the country, the consequences on investment and economic growth are more severe and affects the economies of the countries (especially [[developing countries]]) in macro level.

'''''Cheech &amp; Chong's Animated Movie!''''' is an American [[stoner comedy]]-[[animated film]] by Branden Chambers and Eric D. Chambers. It stars comedy duo [[Cheech and Chong]] in their first feature film since 1984's ''[[Cheech &amp; Chong's The Corsican Brothers|The Corsican Brothers]]'', and the first to feature them as animated characters. The film features several of their original comedy bits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff |title=Hey, Man. Where Have You Guys Been? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/arts/30chee.html?8dpc |work=The New York Times |date=2009-01-29 |quote=The duo are also preparing an animated movie based on their comedy bits. }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as "[[Sister Mary Elephant]]", "Sgt. Stedanko", "Ralph and Herbie", "Let's Make a Dope Deal", "[[Earache My Eye]]", and the classic "Dave". It was released on March 18, 2013 by [[20th Century Fox]] and was released on DVD/Blu-ray on April 23, 2013.

The trailer claims it to be an adventure, but scenes shown throughout are mostly animated interpretations of their segments from their comedy albums. It also features a wraparound story of a genital crab named Buster the Body Crab trying to get high from Chong's weed scented head.

==Plot==
The movie opens with an interview with a body crab named Buster living on a bikini-clad woman. The body crab sees Man ([[Tommy Chong]]) passing by and jumps on his beard. Man quickly pulls him out and throws him away. Pedro De Pacas ([[Cheech Marin]]) is shown driving just up the street from the hitchhiking Man. Pedro sees him and stops the car to give Man a ride. Man gets in and they both peel off, sending the body crab flying. The body crab smells the strong marijuana scent left behind from their car and gives chase. Pedro and Man smoke a joint together and drive through traffic as Pedro admires the street lights. A police car suddenly appears from behind and tails them. Man quickly decides to eat all the drugs in the car to avoid being caught with them. After Man does that the police car passes them without pulling them over. The body crab then gets hit by a train while it is still looking for them.

Pedro and Man pull into a theater. They go in and try to find a parking spot. They pull into a spot near theatre speakers and hear knocking from inside their trunk. They then have to park somewhere else so they won't be spotted letting whoever is in the trunk out. Unfortunately, the key breaks off in the lock so Man has to search for a crow bar but he's unsuccessful. Pedro gets out of the car and urinates on the trunk and a camera cut reveals there are two people in the trunk and are afraid of being peed on. The credits start to roll on the movie theater movie and the movie theater speaker announces the movie has ended. Just then Man returns with a load of snacks. Pedro and Man leave the theater.

The next day, a skit with two dogs then takes place. The body crab appears in one of the dogs excrement and is stepped on by Pedro, who winds up taking the body crab home on the bottom of his shoe. He wipes his shoes on the doormat and goes inside and watches television with Man. An interrogation scene from a film plays on the TV. They change the channel and a gameshow involving drugs plays. The gameshow eventually leads into a zit treatment product commercial. Next, a spoof of American Bandstand plays on the television. They then turn off the TV and Pedro pulls out a giant rolled joint that is filled with a sock. They try to smoke it but it just makes them cough. The body crab appears at the window but is soon snatched by a bird and released further away from the house. The body crab lands on the window of a doctor who is examining patients.

A skit involving a Jewish man and his child talking to their doctor starts. The doctor tries to remove a bullet from the child's nose and the bullet explodes, sending the body crab flying. The camera then zooms into a product called Acapulco Gold (which are marijuana joints). Filming of a commercial for this product takes place.

The film cuts back to Pedro in his home and someone knocks at his door claiming to be the police. Pedro then rushes to get rid of all his drugs. After he gets rid of the drugs he answers the door only to be greeted by Man who says "April Fools".

The film then shows a paper article about Afghanistan and a skit taking place there plays out. The body crab then appears on someones shoulder in Afghanistan but is shot. The camera then zooms into a courtroom skit. Soon Man is shown to be on trial. Man wanders around the courtroom and then returns to his table to gather up drugs which were to be used as evidence against him. Man begins to ramble much to the chagrin of his lawyer. Man approaches the judge's desk, climbs on it then passes out. The scene dissolves into Man passed out on the floor in his house. It appears that it was actually a dream. Pedro knocks on the door, waking him up. The "Dave's not here" skit then begins to play out. Pedro is trying to get in but Man refuses to open the door. Pedro gives up and begins to cry. The body crab then appears underneath a deck board but is roasted as he turns into a vampire and is exposed to natural sunlight. Man, still inside, starts to watch a show called "Wake up America". The Wake Up America skit involves a reporter whom is a parody of [[Geraldo Rivera]] investigating  the recording industry. After the reporter is ejected from the studio Pedro is seen walking by. The body crab catches his scent and tries to dive on him from a window sill but lands on an electric wire instead.

Man is shown on the phone at a diner making a drug deal. After that call ends, Pedro makes a few song requests on the phone with a local radio station. Man leaves and a cop approaches Pedro as he is trying to listen to the radio. He finds Man's drugs but since Pedro is the only one around at that time he is arrested instead. He takes Pedro outside and the camera zooms across the street to Sister Mary Elephant's school. Another skit involving a nun teaching a class takes place. Shortly after, Sargent Stadanko then joins Sister Mary Elephant's class to speak out against drug use. Just as Sargent Stadanko is about to leave Pedro opens the door to the class. Pedro and Man then play [[Earache My Eye]]. The body crab appears during the song and starts to head-bang. It runs after them but falls into a jar of chemicals. Pedro and Man are then seen lifted into a rocket and they launch into outer space. The body crab is seen to have made it on the rocket and jumps in Man's beard. The rocket crashes into the moon and the moon proceeds to smoke it as its appearance is similar to a joint.

During the credits a scene shows the body crab singing and having a party on Mans beard. Man again plucks it and throws it away.

'''Comix Fair''' was a [[comic convention]] that was held annually between [[1983 in comics|1983]] and [[1996 in comics|1996]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. It was produced by the Houston-based company Utopia Entertainment.&lt;ref name=Utopia /&gt;

Comix Fairs took place over two days in the summer, from Saturday to Sunday. The convention featured a large range of [[popular culture|pop culture]] elements, primarily [[comic books]] and toys,&lt;ref name=toys&gt;"Comix Fair has toys for all ages," ''Houston Chronicle'' (17 June 1989), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[serial (radio and television)|television serials]], [[science fiction]]/fantasy, film/television, animation, and [[horror fiction|horror]]. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, the convention featured a large floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and [[collectibles]] merchants. The show included an autograph area, as well as an Artists' Alley where comics artists signed autographs and drew sketches. ''[[Tank McNamara]]'' creators [[Jeff Millar]] and [[Bill Hinds]], both based in the Houston area, were frequent guests of the show.

==History==
Comix Fair was the successor to [[Houstoncon]], a large multi-genre convention which took place annually in Houston from 1967–1982. The final Houstoncon, billed as "Ultimate Fantasy," was a fiasco;&lt;ref name=Rouner&gt;Rouner, Jef. [http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/comicpalooza-how-houstons-comics-convention-came-back-from-the-dead-to-become-one-of-the-best-in-the-country-6601901 "Comicpalooza: How Houston's Comics Convention Came Back from the Dead to Become One of the Best in the Country,"] ''Houston Press'' (June 12, 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; Comix Fair was much smaller in scale and, unlike Houstoncon, returned its focus primarily to comic books.

The first Comix Fair was held in the summer of 1983. An impressive guest lineup included media personalities [[Terrence Dicks]] and [[Bill Mumy]], and comics creators [[Jim Shooter]], [[Steve Englehart]], [[Chris Claremont]], [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]], [[Kerry Gammill]], [[Ernie Chan]], [[Josef Rubinstein]], Sam De La Rosa, [[Dick Giordano]], [[Sal Amendola]], [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Len Wein]], [[Mike W. Barr]], [[P. Craig Russell]], Rick Obadiah, [[Mike Grell]], [[Mark Wheatley]] &amp; [[Marc Hempel]], [[Dave Sim|Dave]] &amp; Deni Sim, [[Cat Yronwode]], [[Dean Mullaney]], [[Max Allan Collins]], [[Terry Beatty]], [[John Carbonaro]], [[Jaxon]], [[Jeff Millar]] &amp; [[Bill Hinds]], and [[Jerry Bittle]]. The convention program featured the [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]] characters [[NoMan]] and [[Dynamo (Fox Feature Syndicate)|Dynamo]] (the most recent appearance of the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents had been published by [[Texas Comics]]).

[[Dave Stevens]] was a guest of the 1984 edition of the Comix Fair.

The fourth annual Comix Fair was held August 22–23, 1986, at the Brookhollow Marriott. Official guests included [[Gary Groth]], [[Gil Kane]], [[Joe Pumilia]], [[Jeff Millar]], [[Bill Hinds]], and [[Doug Potter]].&lt;ref&gt;"Comix Fair features cartoonists," ''Houston Chronicle '' (21 Aug 1986), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comix Fair VI was held June 24–26, 1988, at the Ramada Hotel Southwest. Featured guests were [[Sergio Aragonés]], [[Kim DeMulder]], [[Mike Leeke]], and [[William Messner-Loebs]].&lt;ref&gt;"Comix Fair socks it to fans," ''Houston Chronicle'' (24 June 1988), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh annual&lt;ref name=toys /&gt; Comix Fair took place June 16–17, 1989, at the Ramada Hotel Southwest.&lt;ref name=Victoria&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19890615&amp;id=djlSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TzYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6028,3179038&amp;hl=en "Victoria Artist Due at Fair,"] ''[[The Victoria Advocate]]'' (June 15, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Guests included [[John Romita, Jr.]], [[Bob Layton]], [[Tim Vigil]],&lt;ref&gt;"Comix Fair ready for Batman fans," ''Houston Chronicle'' (16 June 1989), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doug Hazlewood]].&lt;ref name=Victoria /&gt;

Comix Fair VIII was held August 4–5, 1990, at the Holiday Inn—Medical Center; guests were [[Bill Hinds]], [[Jeff Millar]], and [[Doug Hazlewood]].&lt;ref&gt;"Funny business," ''Houston Chronicle'' (03 Aug 1990), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1991 Comix Fair expanded to three days, taking place June 21–23 at the Holiday Inn—Medical Center. Guests included [[Russ Heath]], [[Nestor Redondo]], [[Jeff Millar]], [[Bill Hinds]], and [[Rick Klaw]].&lt;ref&gt;"'Rocketeer' lands at Comix Fair," ''Houston Chronicle'' (21 June 1991), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourteenth and final show, officially known as the "Houston Comix Fair &amp; Toy Show," was held June 2, 1996, at the Medallion Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;"Book events," ''Houston Chronicle'' (02 June 1996), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Guests included [[Mart Nodell]] and [[Shannon Wheeler]].

By this time, Comix Fair promoter Utopia Entertainment was putting on one-day small-scale shows in the Houston area on a bimonthly basis. (One of these recurring smaller events was dubbed "LepreCon.") Guests of some of these shows included [[Doug Hazlewood]], [[Kenneth Smith (comics)|Kenneth Smith]], [[Gil Kane]], [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], [[Amanda Conner]], [[Mike Grell]], [[Mike Wieringo]], [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]], [[Brian Stelfreeze]], [[Susie Owens]], [[Bjo Trimble]], [[Mark Allen Shepherd]], [[Len Wein]], [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Jerry Bingham]], [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]], [[William Stout]], [[Sean Stewart]], [[Marilyn Burns]], and [[Edwin Neal]].&lt;ref name=Utopia /&gt;

A 15th Comix Fair was planned for June 22, 1997, at the Holiday Inn Select,&lt;ref name=Utopia&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19970306024504/http://www.flex.net/utopia/ Comix Fair page at Utopia Entertainment] (June 17, 1997). Archived at the Wayback Machine. Accessed May 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; but the show never materialized.

== Legacy ==
After many years of Comix Fair being the only comic convention in Houston, on August 7–8, 1993, the University of Houston hosted the "Houston Comic Book Festival," with official guests [[Chris Claremont]], [[Matt Wagner]], [[Kelley Jones]], [[Joe St. Pierre]], [[Evan Dorkin]], and [[Mike Leeke]].

After Comix Fair's demise in 1996, Houston was devoid of comic conventions until the mid-2000s, when [[Comicpalooza]] entered the scene. Since then, the number of Houston-area conventions has exploded, with shows like the Houston Comic Con, Amazing Houston Comic Con, and Space City Comic Con all taking place in the city.

The [[Nicaragua]]–[[Costa Rica]] [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] [[Territorial dispute|border dispute]] is a series of periodical conflicts between the two [[Central America]]n nations over the correct delimitation of their common [[Costa Rica–Nicaragua border|border]] at its east-end, and the interpretation of the navigation rights on the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] established in the [[Cañas-Jerez Treaty]] of 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/the-first-google-maps-war/ |title=The First Google Maps War |date=February 28, 2012 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |author=Frank Jacobs |access-date=2012-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503101830/http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/the-first-google-maps-war/ |archive-date=2012-05-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent disputes include an interpretation about the scope and limits of Costa Rica's rights for free navigation and Nicaragua's sovereign control over the San Juan River, which was resolved by the [[International Court of Justice]] in 2009; and the ongoing dispute that began in October 2010 regarding the dredging of San Juan River, in the area of [[Isla Calero]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}

According to the [[Cañas-Jerez Treaty]] of 1858, reaffirmed in arbitration by President [[Grover Cleveland]] of the [[United States]] in 1888 and interpreted by the Central American Court of Justice in 1916 (case ''Costa Rica v. Nicaragua''), Nicaragua is [[sovereignty|sovereign]] over the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|Río San Juan]], and [[Costa Rica]] has the right to navigate over part of the river with articles for trade which in case of need, as determined by Nicaragua can be accompanied by revenue cutters. The treaty also states that no taxes would be imposed on Costa Rican trade in goods except those accepted by mutual agreement.

Historically, the possibility that the Río San Juan might become the route for a [[Nicaragua Canal]] has exacerbated the dispute. The construction of the [[Panama Canal]] as well as Nicaragua's dry [[ecocanal]] project have largely deflated this motive for friction.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==2009 International Court of Justice case==
A dispute emerged in 1998 when Nicaragua forbade the transit of Costa Rican policemen in the river, which Nicaragua claims to be a breach of sovereignty, and unilaterally imposed a {{USD|25}} tax for any Costa Rican tourists who enter the San Juan river, as persons are not objects of trade but subjects of trade and are, therefore, not covered by the treaty. This and other subjects were the subjects of a case in the [[International Court of Justice]].

On July 13, 2009, the International Court of Justice published the following ruling:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/133/15321.pdf Case concerning the dispute regarding navigational and related rights (''Costa Rica v. Nicaragua'')] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202012759/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/133/15321.pdf |date=2015-02-02 }}, International Court of Justice, 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

# As regards Costa Rica’s navigational rights on the San Juan river under the 1858 Treaty, in that part where navigation is common, the court finds: that Costa Rica has the right of free navigation on the San Juan river for purposes of commerce including the transport of passengers and the transport of tourists. People travelling on the San Juan river on board Costa Rican vessels exercising Costa Rica’s right of free navigation are not required to obtain Nicaraguan visas or to purchase tourist cards. That the inhabitants of the Costa Rican bank of the San Juan river have the right to navigate on the river between the riparian communities for the purposes of the essential needs of everyday life which require expeditious transportation. That Costa Rica has the right of navigation on the San Juan River with official vessels used solely, in specific situations, to provide essential services for the inhabitants of the riparian areas where expeditious transportation is a condition for meeting the inhabitants’ requirements. That Costa Rica does not have the right of navigation on the San Juan river with vessels carrying out police functions. That Costa Rica does not have the right of navigation on the San Juan river for the purposes of the exchange of personnel of the police border posts along the right bank of the river and of the re-supply of these posts, with official equipment, including service arms and ammunition.
# As regards Nicaragua’s right to regulate navigation on the San Juan river, in that part where navigation is common, the court finds that Nicaragua has the right to require Costa Rican vessels and their passengers to stop at the first and last Nicaraguan post on their route along the San Juan River; That Nicaragua has the right to require persons travelling on the San Juan river to carry a passport or an identity document; that Nicaragua has the right to issue departure clearance certificates to Costa Rican vessels exercising Costa Rica’s right of free navigation but does not have the right to request the payment of a charge for the issuance of such certificates; that Nicaragua has the right to impose timetables for navigation on vessels navigating on the San Juan River; that Nicaragua has the right to require Costa Rican vessels fitted with masts or turrets to display the Nicaraguan flag;
# As regards subsistence fishing, the court Finds that fishing by the inhabitants of the Costa Rican bank of the San Juan river for subsistence purposes from that bank is to be respected by Nicaragua as a customary right;
#As regards Nicaragua’s compliance with its international obligations under the [[Cañas–Jerez Treaty|1858 Treaty]], the court finds that Nicaragua is not acting in accordance with its obligations under the 1858 Treaty when it requires persons travelling on the San Juan River on board Costa Rican vessels exercising Costa Rica’s right of free navigation to obtain Nicaraguan visas; when it requires persons travelling on the San Juan River on board Costa Rican vessels exercising Costa Rica’s right of free navigation to purchase Nicaraguan tourist cards; and when it requires the operators of vessels exercising Costa Rica’s right of free navigation to pay charges for departure clearance certificates.

Both countries took different approaches on how to solve the issue, Nicaragua argued it was a border dispute that should be resolved by [[International Court of Justice]], while Costa Rica claimed it was a military incursion and that the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) should solve the issue,&lt;ref name=WasPost1102/&gt;

OAS General Secretary [[José Miguel Insulza]] met with both governments and inspected the conflict area.

On November 18, 2010, Costa Rica filed proceedings against Nicaragua in the [[International Court of Justice]]. The complaint alleges an incursion into, occupation of and use by Nicaragua's Army of Costa Rican territory, breaches of Nicaragua's treaty obligations toward Costa Rica, and “ongoing and planned dredging and the construction of the canal (that) will seriously affect the flow of water to the Colorado River of Costa Rica, and will cause further damage to Costa Rican territory, including the [[wetland]]s and national wildlife protected areas located in the region”. Costa Rica also filed a request for provisional measures, including the withdrawal of all Nicaraguan troops from Isla Calero, the cessation of the construction of a canal across Costa Rican territory, the immediate cessation of the dumping of sediment in Costa Rican territory and immediate cessation of the felling of trees, removal of vegetation and soil from Costa Rican territory, including its wetlands and forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nacion.com/2010-11-18/ElPais/UltimaHora/ElPais2595386.aspx|title=Costa Rica lleva conflicto a Corte de La Haya|work=[[La Nación (San José)]]|author=Alvaro Murillo|date=2010-11-18|accessdate=2010-11-21|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121153324/http://www.nacion.com/2010-11-18/ElPais/UltimaHora/ElPais2595386.aspx|archive-date=2010-11-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/150/16239.pdf?PHPSESSID=e62a8b5e430fbd1e33707c18aa61b6f7|title=Costa Rica institutes proceedings against Nicaragua and requests the Court to indicate provisional measures|publisher=[[International Court of Justice]] Press Release No. 2010/38|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2010-11-21}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, OAS approved a Costa Rican request, by a vote of 22 to 1 (and 7 abstentions), to convene a Consultative Meeting of OAS Ministers of Foreign Affairs to analyze the situation between Costa Rica and Nicaragua in the border zone of the San Juan River.

In March 2011, The International Court of Justice provisionally ruled that Costa Rica and Nicaragua both must refrain from sending or maintaining civilians, security forces or police in this disputed border area, but that Costa Rica was allowed to send civilian teams concerned with environmental matters. Dredging by Nicaragua within the San Juan River itself was allowed to continue since Nicaragua has sovereignty over the river proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/150/16324.pdf?PHPSESSID=dfc78e071a095818c7de6e8f8f29aa1b |title=International Court of Justice recent provisional Costa Rica-Nicaragua decision |access-date=2011-04-11 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160405043857/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/150/16324.pdf |archive-date=2016-04-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Costa Rica argues it was necessary for protecting from the "Sandinistas" and for providing [[electricity]] and other needs to people who live in a remote location, to which before the road was made, the only way in was sailing in the San Juan River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sonoranchronicle.com/2012/02/29/sc-wire-new-road-along-costa-rica-nicaragua-border/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-31 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203065415/http://sonoranchronicle.com/2012/02/29/sc-wire-new-road-along-costa-rica-nicaragua-border/ |archive-date=2013-02-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 Resolution==

On December 16, 2015, [[The International Court of Justice]] published its ruling:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/150/18848.pdf Case Concerning Certain Activities carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222112623/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/150/18848.pdf |date=2015-12-22 }}, International Court of Justice, 16 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that:
* Costa Rica has sovereignty over the disputed territory. By excavating three caños and establishing a military presence on Costa Rican territory, Nicaragua violated the territorial sovereignty of Costa Rica. By excavating two caños in 2013 and establishing a military presence in the disputed territory, Nicaragua breached the provisional ruling issued by the Court on 8 March 2011. Furthermore, Nicaragua breached Costa Rica’s rights of navigation on the San Juan River pursuant to the 1858 Treaty of Limits. Nicaragua  has  the  obligation  to  compensate  Costa  Rica  for material damages caused by Nicaragua’s unlawful activities on Costa Rican territory. Said compensation will be agreed upon by the parties before December 16, 2016, or, failing agreement, shall be determined by the court.
* Costa Rica violated its obligation under general international law by failing to carry out an environmental impact assessment concerning the construction of Route 1856.

In June 2016, Costa Rica made an estimation of the damage to be paid of {{USD|6700000}}. It accepted to make a second evaluation of the damages if Nicaragua requested it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/12/17/costa-rica-nicaragua-deadline-payment|title=Costa Rica extends deadline to settle payment with Nicaragua for environmental damage|work=[[The Tico Times]]|author=L.

Just before the end of the deadline, on December the 6th 2016, the president of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega publicly stated that his country was willing to pay the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.co.cr/nicaragua-confirms-plans-pay-costa-rica-environmental-damages/53899/|title=Nicaragua Confirms Plans to Pay Costa Rica for Environmental Damages|work=[[The Costa Rica Star]]|date=2016-12-07|accessdate=2017-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716082735/http://news.co.cr/nicaragua-confirms-plans-pay-costa-rica-environmental-damages/53899/|archive-date=2017-07-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lead Costa Rica to extend the deadline for the amount agreement.
 
On 16 January 2017, still no agreement on the amount was reached. The Costa Rica government filled a new case to the International Court of Justice concerning new military presence on its territory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/costa-rica-sues-nicaragua-over-land-dispute/a-37154779|title=Costa Rica sues Nicaragua over land dispute|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=2017-01-17|accessdate=2017-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125152255/http://www.dw.com/en/costa-rica-sues-nicaragua-over-land-dispute/a-37154779|archive-date=2017-01-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asked the court to fix a final amount and a deadline concerning the 2015 resolution's compensation.

The '''Data Protection Act 1998''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents c 29]) is a [[United Kingdom]] [[Act of Parliament]] designed to protect personal data stored on computers or in an organised paper filing system. It enacted the EU [[Data Protection Directive 1995]]'s provisions on the protection, processing and movement of data. 

Under the DPA 1998, individuals had legal rights to control information about themselves. Most of the Act did not apply to domestic use,&lt;ref name="exemptions"&gt;''Data Protection Act 1998'', [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980029_en_5#pt4-l1g36 Part IV (Exemptions), Section 36], [[Office of Public Sector Information]], accessed 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for example keeping a personal address book. Anyone holding personal data for other purposes was legally obliged to comply with this Act, subject to some exemptions. The Act defined eight data protection principles to ensure that information was processed lawfully.

It was superseded by the [[Data Protection Act 2018]] (DPA 2018) on 23 May 2018. The DPA 2018 supplements the EU [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), which came into effect on 25 May 2018. The GDPR regulates the collection, storage, and use of personal data significantly more strictly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Michael|date=Mar 1999|title=Recent legislation. The Data Protection Act 1998.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=44402648&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=Industrial Law Journal|volume=28|pages=57-60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The 1998 Act replaced the [[Data Protection Act 1984]] and the [[Access to Personal Files Act 1987]], and implemented the EU [[Data Protection Directive 1995]]. 

The [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003]] altered the consent requirement for most electronic marketing to "positive consent" such as an opt-in box. Exemptions remain for the marketing of "similar products and services" to existing customers and enquirers, which can still be given permission on an opt out basis.

The [[Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2005|Jersey data protection law]] was modelled on the UK law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=63832 Jersey: Data Protection In Jersey And Other Offshore Jurisdictions] 23 July 2008 Article by Wendy Benjamin, mondaq.com,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
===Scope of protection===
Section 1 defines "personal data" as any data that can be used to identify a living individual. Anonymised or aggregated data is less regulated by the Act, providing the anonymisation or aggregation has not been done in a reversible way. Individuals can be identified by various means including their name and address, telephone number or email address. The Act applies only to data which is held, or intended to be held, on computers ('equipment operating automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose'), or held in a 'relevant filing system'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/1|title=Data Protection Act 1998, Basic interpretative provisions|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases paper records may be classified as a 'relevant filing system', such as an address book or a salesperson's diary used to support commercial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1609/what_is_data_for_the_purposes_of_the_dpa.pdf |title=Determining what information is ‘data’ for the purposes of the DPA|publisher=[[Information Commissioner's Office]]|date=16 March 2012|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] modified the act for public bodies and authorities, and the ''Durant'' case modified the interpretation of the act by providing case law and precedent.&lt;ref name="pinsent-durant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-8427|title=What is personal data? Information Commissioner updates guidance|date=30 August 2007|publisher=[[Pinsent Masons]]|accessdate=20 August 2012|quote=In the case involving Michael Durant he sought information held on him by the Financial Services Authority.  The Court of Appeal ruled that just because a document contained his name it was not necessarily defined as personal data.  This changed the perception of how wide a definition of personal data could be.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who has their data processed has the following rights:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ico.org.uk/what_we_cover/data_protection/your_rights.aspx Your rights]'', ICO, accessed 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-6-rights/ The rights of individuals (Principle 6)]", ICO, accessed 7 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
*under section 7, to view the data an organisation holds on them for a reasonable fee: the maximum fee is £2 for requests to credit reference agencies, £50 for health and educational request, and £10 per individual otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ico.org.uk/Global/faqs/data_protection_for_the_public.aspx#f5EED57A6-1B5C-4032-A7A3-22ECBBF66D3D |title=FAQs |publisher=[[Information Commissioner's Office]]|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*under section 14, request that incorrect information be corrected. If the company ignores the request, a court can order the data to be corrected or destroyed, and in some cases [[Damages|compensation]] can be awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/compensation/|title=Claiming compensation|publisher=[[Information Commissioner's Office]]|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*under section 10, require that data is not used in any way that may potentially cause damage or distress.&lt;ref&gt;''Data Protection Act 1998'', [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/10 Part II (Rights of data subjects and others), Section 10], Office of Public Sector Information, accessed 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*under section 11, require that their data is not used for [[direct marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;''Data Protection Act 1998'', [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/11 Part II (Rights of data subjects and others), Section 11], Office of Public Sector Information, accessed 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data protection principles===
Schedule 1 lists eight "data protection principles".
# Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless:
## at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and
## in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.
# Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.
# Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.
# Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
# Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
# About the rights of individuals e.g.&lt;ref&gt;The rights of individuals (Principle 6), [http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide/principle_6.aspx ICO.org.uk], accessed 14 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects (individuals).
# Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.
# Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the [[European Economic Area]] unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.

;Conditions relevant to the first principle
Personal data should only be processed fairly and lawfully. In order for data to be classed as 'fairly processed', at least one of these six conditions must be applicable to that data (Schedule 2).
# The data subject (the person whose data is stored) has consented ("given their permission") to the processing;
# Processing is necessary for the performance of, or commencing, a contract;
# Processing is required under a legal obligation (other than one stated in the contract);
# Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject;
# Processing is necessary to carry out any public functions;
# Processing is necessary in order to pursue the legitimate interests of the "data controller" or "third parties" (unless it could unjustifiably prejudice the interests of the data subject).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980029_en_10#sch2 OPSI.gov.uk] Data Protection Act 1998 Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

;Consent
Except under the below mentioned exceptions, the individual needs to consent to the collection of their personal information and its use in the purpose(s) in question. The [[Data Protection Directive|European Data Protection Directive]] defines consent as “…any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed”, meaning the individual may ''signify'' agreement other than in writing. However, non-communication should not be interpreted as consent.

Additionally, consent should be appropriate to the age and capacity of the individual and other circumstances of the case. E.g., if an organization "intends to continue to hold or use personal data after the relationship with the individual ends, then the consent should cover this." And even when consent is given, it shouldn't be assumed to last forever. Although in most cases consent lasts for as long as the personal data needs to be processed, individuals may be able to withdraw their consent, depending on the nature of the consent and the circumstances in which the personal information is being collected and used.&lt;ref name="conditions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide/conditions_for_processing.aspx|title=Conditions for Processing – Guide to Data Protection – ICO|publisher=Information Commissioner's Office|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Data Protection Act also specifies that sensitive personal data must be processed according to a stricter set of conditions, in particular any consent must be explicit.&lt;ref name="conditions"/&gt;

===Exceptions===
The Act is structured such that all processing of personal data is covered by the act, while providing a number of exceptions in Part IV.&lt;ref name= "exemptions"/&gt; Notable exceptions are:
* Section 28 – National security. Any processing for the purpose of safeguarding national security is exempt from all the data protection principles, as well as Part II (subject access rights), Part III (notification), Part V (enforcement), and Section 55 (Unlawful obtaining of personal data).
* Section 29 – Crime and taxation. Data processed for the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, or the assessment or collection of taxes are exempt from the first data protection principle.
* Section 36 – Domestic purposes. Processing by an individual only for the purposes of that individual's personal, family or household affairs is exempt from all the data protection principles, as well as Part II (subject access rights) and Part III (notification).

===Police and court powers===
The Act grants or acknowledges various police and court powers.
* Section 29 – Consent of the Data Subject is not required when processing Personal Data to prevent or detect crime, apprehend or prosecute offenders, the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and to discharge a statutory function.&lt;ref&gt;''Data Protection Act 1998'', [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/29 Part IV (Exceptions – Crime and taxation), Section 29]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section 35 – Disclosures required by law or made in connection with legal proceedings. This includes obeying court orders, other laws and are part of legal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Data Protection Act 1998'', [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/35 Part IV (Exemptions – Disclosures required by law or made in connection with legal proceedings etc.), Section 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offences===
The Act details a number of civil and criminal offences for which data controllers may be liable if a data controller has failed to gain appropriate consent from a data subject. However, 'consent' is not specifically defined in the Act and so is a common law matter.
* Section 21(1) makes it an offence to process personal information without [[Register of data controllers|registration]].&lt;ref name="opsi"&gt;''Data Protection Act 1998'', [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980029_en_4#pt3-l1g21 Part III (Notification by Data Controllers), Section 21], Office of Public Sector Information)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section 21(2) makes it an offence to fail to comply with the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/188/made notification regulations] made by the Secretary of State&lt;ref name="opsi" /&gt; (proposed by the [[Information Commissioner's Office|Information Commissioner]] under section 25 of the Act).&lt;ref&gt;''Data Protection Act 1998'', [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/25 Part III (Notification by Data Controllers), Section 25]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section 55 makes unlawful obtaining of personal data. This section makes it an offence for people (Other Parties), such as hackers and impersonators, outside the organisation to obtain unauthorised access to the personal data.&lt;ref&gt;''Data Protection Act 1998'', [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980029_en_7#pt6-pb2-l1g55 Part VI (Miscellaneous and General), Section 55], Office of Public Sector Information, accessed 14 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section 56 makes it a criminal offence to require an individual to make a Subject Access Request relating to [[Police caution|cautions]] or [[conviction]]s for the purposes of recruitment, continued employment, or the provision of services.&lt;ref&gt;''Data Protection Act 1998'', [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980029_en_7#pt6-pb3-l1g56 Part VI (Miscellaneous and General), Section 56], Office of Public Sector Information, accessed 14 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This section came into force on 10 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lewissilkin.com/Journal/2015/March/Forced-data-subject-access-requests-are-now-a-criminal-offence.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===
The UK Data Protection Act is a large Act that has a reputation for complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, D: "Introduction to Computer Law – Fifth Edition", page 430. Pearson Education Limited, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While the basic principles are honoured for protecting privacy, interpreting the act is not always simple. Many companies, organisations and individuals seem very unsure of the aims, content and principles of the Act. Some hide behind the Act and refuse to provide even very basic, publicly available material quoting the Act as a restriction.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ico.org.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/introductory/data_protection_myths_and_realities.pdf Data Protection myths and realities]'', [[Information Commissioner's Office]], accessed 30 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also impacts on the way in which organisations conduct business in terms of who can be contacted for marketing purposes, not only by telephone and direct mail but also electronically and has led to the development of permission based marketing strategies.

===Definition of personal data===
The definition of personal data is data relating to a living individual who can be identified
* from that data or
* from that data and other information in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller

Sensitive personal data concerns the subject's race, ethnicity, politics, religion, trade union status, health, sex life or criminal record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents|title=Data Protection Act 1998|work=[[UK Statute Law Database]]|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subject Access Requests===
The Information Commissioner's Office website states regarding Subject Access Requests (SARs)&lt;ref name="SAR"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-of-access/ |title=Your right of access |website=Information Commissioner's Office|date=  |author= |accessdate= 25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;: "''You have the right to find out if an organisation is using or storing your personal data. This is called the right of access. You exercise this right by asking for a copy of the data, which is commonly known as making a ‘subject access request''".
Before the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on 25 May 2018 organisations could charge a specified fee for responding to a SAR, of up to £10 for most requests. Following the GDPR&lt;ref name="SAR"/&gt;: "''A copy of your personal data should be provided free. An organisation may charge for additional copies. It can only charge a fee if it thinks the request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’. If so, it may ask for a reasonable fee for administrative costs associated with the request''."

===Information Commissioner===
{{main|Information Commissioner's Office}}
Compliance with the Act is regulated and enforced by an independent authority, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]], which maintains guidance relating to the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/guide_to_data_protection|title=The Guide to Data Protection|publisher=[[Information Commissioner's Office]]|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Guidance – The Data Protection Act'', [http://www.ico.org.uk/what_we_cover/data_protection/guidance.aspx Page of Assorted Guidance], [[Information Commissioner's Office]], accessed 20 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== EU’s Article 29 Working Party ===
In January 2017 the Information Commissioner's Office invited public comments on the EU’s Article 29 Working Party's proposed changes to data protection law and the anticipated introduction of extensions to the interpretation of the Act, the [[General Data Protection Regulation|Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/|title=Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|last=|first=|date=22 December 2017|website=ico.org.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deditio''' or '''''deditiones''''' was a ritual of submission in medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="Dalewski2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zbigniew Dalewski|title=Ritual and Politics: Writing the History of a Dynastic Conflict in Medieval Poland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IN-wCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=21 April 2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-474-3337-8|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a ceremony of subjection between a monarch and his subject, and included the latter bowing or laying by the feet of the monarch, barefooted and wearing ropes.

'''F4 British Championship''' (full name '''F4 British Championship certified by FIA&amp;nbsp;— powered by Ford''', formerly known as '''MSA Formula''')  is a [[single-seater]] motorsport series based in the [[United Kingdom]]. The series will be run to the [[FIA|FIA's]] [[Formula 4]] regulations, and is administered by [[Motor Sports Association]]. The championship is designed as a low-cost entrance to car racing, and is aimed at young racing drivers moving up from [[karting]].

The championship replaces the [[British Formula Ford Championship]], and uses a chassis produced by [[Mygale]] and engines from [[Ford]]. The series is part of the [[TOCA]] tour, a series of events run alongside the [[British Touring Car Championship]].

== Championship format ==
Each championship event consists of three races. The series is run in support of the BTCC

Fifteen-year-olds are eligible to compete in the series, after the MSA lowered the age limit for single-seater championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Scott|title=MSA to allow 15-year-olds in UK single-seaters from 2015|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/115360/|website=Autosport.com|publisher=Haymarket Media|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the championship will be named the FIA Formula 4 champion, and will be rewarded a test with a [[FIA European Formula Three Championship]] team.&lt;ref name="New MSA" /&gt;

== The car ==
[[Mygale]] provide a carbon-fibre monocoque chassis. The engine is a [[Ford]] 1.6L [[EcoBoost]] engine as used in the more modern [[Formula Ford]] cars, tuned to a maximum of 160 PS. All engines are prepared and tuned by Sodemo, to lower costs and ensure engine equalisation.&lt;ref name="New MSA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Scott|title=New UK FIA Formula 4 series MSA Formula to use Mygale chassis|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/115898|website=Autosport.com|publisher=Haymarket Media|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hankook]] are the sole tyre supplier, with the cars running on the same compound and construction rubber as used in Formula Three. Sadev provide the sequential paddle shift transmission. The engine control unit is an F88GDI4 from [[Life Racing]] which features integrated paddle shift control, GPS track mapping and also functions as the complete data acquisition system.

The total price of purchasing the car is capped at £36,000.&lt;ref name="New MSA" /&gt;

''''' Feeding Everyone No Matter What: Managing Food Security After Global Catastrophe''''' is a book written by David Denkenberger and [[Joshua M. Pearce]] and published by [[Elsevier]] under their [[Academic Press]].

[[Food storage]] for the entire global population is the only historical solution for a global disruption of conventional [[agriculture]] due to [[global catastrophic risks|global catastrophes]] such as [[abrupt climate change]] and [[nuclear winter]], despite three decades of awareness of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom, N &amp; Cirkovic, MM. 2008, ''Global Catastrophic Risks'', Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; But for large global catastrophes, at least five years of supplies are needed because agriculture would be hampered for that time. This large of a stockpile is economically prohibitive on a global scale or even within the US.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wisconsin Ag Connection - Michigan News - Bacterial Slime: It's What's for Dinner|url = http://www.wisconsinagconnection.com/story-regional.php?tble=MI2014&amp;ID=1117|website = www.wisconsinagconnection.com|access-date = 2014-11-26|publisher = Wisconsin Agriculture Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of global catastrophes that apply is large and the book analyzed five crop-destroying catastrophes (sudden climate change, super-weeds, super-bacteria, super-pests and super-pathogens) and three sunlight-extinguishing events ([[supervolcano]] eruption, asteroid or [[comet impact]], and nuclear winter).&lt;ref name="Messinger"&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2014-11-bacterial-slime-survivalist-solution-catastrophic.html] Danny Messinger. "Bacterial slime may be survivalist solution to catastrophic crop failure." Phys.org, Nov 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The book '''''Feeding Everyone No Matter What''''' proposes more than 10 solutions for providing the global food supply according to ''Discovery News''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/human/10-foods-you-could-eat-after-a-global-catastrophe-141120.htm 10 Foods You Could Eat After a Global Catastrophe] Jennifer Viegas. Discovery News, Nov 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The study that is the foundation of the book involves [[interdisciplinarity]] and gives instructions for the [[survivalism]] movement. ''Feeding Everyone No Matter What'' has been covered extensively by the international media.&lt;ref name="Messinger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/a-guide-to-the-most-nutritious-post-apocalypse-cuisine-1675341435/all] - Mark Strauss.

''Feeding Everyone No Matter What'' is also known by organizations working on the prevention of Global Catastrophic Risks.

== Claims ==
The authors, David Denkenberger and [[Joshua Pearce]], claim alternate food sources could feed everyone even if the sun is blocked by catastrophes like [[nuclear winter]], [[supervolcano]] eruption, or large [[asteroid]]/[[comet]] impact. At first this appears unlikely because malnutrition and hunger-related disease now{{when?|date=November 2018}} kill 6.5 million children under five years old each year.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) 2006.“[http://www.unicef.org/sowc06/ The state of the World’s children.]” 148.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the book focuses on what is technically possible and assumes global cooperation. The solutions also address crises including [[abrupt climate change]], super weeds, super crop [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s (animals, e.g. insects), super [[bacteria]] (e.g. disrupts beneficial bacteria) and super crop [[pathogen]]s. The solution using fossil fuel energy source is natural gas digesting bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unibio.dk/] "UniBio A/S - turns NG to fish food." Accessed February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A solution if the sun is not completely blocked is [[ocean fertilization]] because 0.1% of the ocean area undergoes coastal upwelling (bringing nutrients to the surface) and yet this produces 50% of the world's fish catch.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, J. &amp; Hobbs, P. 1977 ''Atmospheric Science''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruminant]]s and other grazers can digest [[dietary fiber]], but do not have enough offspring to feed everyone within 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Denkenberger and J. M. Pearce. ''Feeding Everyone No Matter What: Managing Food Security After Global Catastrophe'', Elsevier, San Francisco, 2014, pp. 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mushroom]]s can grow directly on wood without sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;Hazeltine, B. &amp; Bull, C. 2003 ''Field Guide to Appropriate Technology''. San Francisco: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[beetle]]s can digest [[cellulose]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandra Walczynska 2007 "Energy budget of wood-feeding larvae of Corymbia rubra (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)." ''Eur. J. Entomol.'' 104, 181–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cellulosic biofuel]] production typically already creates sugar as an intermediate product.&lt;ref&gt;Langan, P., Gnanakaran, S., Rector, K. D., Pawley, N., Fox, D. T., Chof, D. W. &amp; Hammelg, K. E. 2011 "Exploring new strategies for cellulosic biofuels production." ''Energy Environ. Sci.'' 4, 3820–3833.&lt;/ref&gt; There are edible calories in leaves, but there is too much dietary fiber, so solutions include making [[tea]], [[chewing]] and not swallowing the solids, and making [[leaf protein concentrate]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K.-Y. &amp; Chung, H.-J. 2000 "Flavor compounds of pine sprout tea and pine needle tea." ''J. Agric. Food Chem.'' 48, 1269–1272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, D. &amp; Leaf for Life 1993 "Leaf concentrate: A field guide for small-scale programs."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] can be predigested by bacteria so that animals that are poor at digesting cellulose can derive nutrition, such as [[rat]]s&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, R. B., Peterson, D. A. &amp; Tolbert, B. M. 1960 "Cellulose metabolism in the rat." ''J. Nutr.'' 72, 353.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly [[chicken]]s.

As a backup plan, it is even possible that humans could eat this predigested biomass.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Denkenberger and J. M. Pearce. ''Feeding Everyone No Matter What: Managing Food Security After Global Catastrophe'', Elsevier, San Francisco, 2014, pp. 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In a sun-obscuring crisis, stored food would last the human population less than one year. The book shows how many of these solutions can be ramped up in less than one year.

This book also addresses other issues, including [[energy supply]], [[water supply]], [[fiber|forest products]], [[human nutrition]], and preserving [[endangered species]]. Furthermore, the book gives instructions for the [[survivalism|prepper]] movement.

==Criticisms==
The authors themselves admitted a potential [[moral hazard]] with publishing the solutions, as for example [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] would explicitly state that a motivating factor for reducing the nuclear arsenal of the [[USSR]] was the concept of nuclear winter,&lt;ref&gt;Toon, O, Robock, A &amp; Turco, R 2008, "Environmental consequences of nuclear war," ''Phys. Today'', vol. 61, no. 37, pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt; however the politician would neglect to mention the primary "politically incorrect" factor, which was the crumbling [[Soviet economy]] could no longer pay for its militarism. {{citation-needed|date=December 2017}}

However, despite the popularity of the concept of "nuclear winter", there is a clear and present threat of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] abrupt climate change and the results of efforts to prevent [[global climate change]] have been ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Yone, GW, Lasco, RD, Ahmad, QK, Arnell, NW, Cohen, SJ, Hope, C, Janetos, AC &amp; Perez, RT 2007, "Perspectives on climate change and sustainability," ''Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change''.&lt;/ref&gt; In their analysis, Denkenberger and Pearce argue that the benefits of a food solution backup plan would reduce overall harm to humanity in the global catastrophes over which control is possible and could reduce the damages associated with catastrophes over which humanity has very little or no control (e.g. supervolcanoes).&lt;ref&gt;Denkenberger, D. C., &amp; Pearce, J. M. (2014).

'''Fettisdagen''' (''The Fat Tuesday'') is the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] name for the Tuesday after the [[Quinquagesima]] and the day between [[Shrove Monday]] and [[Ash Wednesday]]. Because it is the last day before the [[Lent]]en [[Fasting|fast]], a tradition has developed of eating buns, called "fastlagsbullar",  "fettisdagsbullar" (Fat Tuesday Buns) or "[[semla]]". The day is also called "White Tuesday" because the buns are made out of white flour.

The day is called "[[Mardi Gras]]" in [[France]], "Carnaval" or "Vastenavond" in [[the Netherlands]], "[[Laskiainen]]" (or "fastlagstisdagen") in [[Finland]], "vastlapäev" in [[Estonia]], and "[[Fastelavn]]" in [[Denmark]]. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] it is known as [[Shrove Tuesday]] or Pancake Day.

'''Grain entrapment''', or '''grain engulfment''', occurs when a person becomes submerged in [[grain]] and cannot get out without assistance. This more frequently occurs at storage facilities such as [[silo]]s or [[grain elevator]]s, but has been known to occur around any large quantity of grain, even freestanding piles outdoors. Usually, unstable grain collapses suddenly, wholly or partially burying workers who may be within it. Entrapment occurs when victims are partially submerged but cannot remove themselves; engulfment occurs when they are completely buried within the grain.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Flowing Grain Entrapment, Grain Rescue and Strategies, and Grain Entrapment Prevention Measures|url=http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/grainlab/content/pdf/QuestionFlowingGrainEntrap.pdf|publisher=Agricultural Safety and Health Program, [[Purdue University]]|page=1|date=April 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engulfment has a very high fatality rate.&lt;ref name="2011 JASH article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=M.J.|author2=Deboy, G.R. |author3=Field, W.E. |author4= Maier, D.E. |title=Summary of prior grain entrapment rescue strategies.|journal=Journal of Agricultural Safety and Health|date=October 2011|volume=17|issue=4|pages=303–25|pmid=22164461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the death rate from workplace accidents on American farms has declined in the first decade of the 21st century, grain-entrapment deaths have not, reaching an all-time annual high of 26 in 2010. Many of those victims have been minors.&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Broder|first=John M.|title=Silos Loom as Death Traps on American Farms|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/us/on-us-farms-deaths-in-silos-persist.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural organizations have worked to protect them and improve rescue techniques, as well as spread awareness among farmers of prevention methods. Primary among these is a federal regulation that forbids opening an [[Screw conveyor|auger]] or other opening at the bottom of a grain storage facility while someone is known to be "walking down the grain" within.

Smaller family farms, however, are exempt from most federal labor regulation specific to agriculture, and no safety regulations govern children working for their parents. In 2011 the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] proposed sweeping new regulations that would have changed this, prohibiting underage workers from being allowed to enter silos, among other provisions. They were withdrawn after protests from farmers and politicians of both U.S. parties.

At some grain-handling facilities, employees "walk down the grain" on top of it to expedite the flow of grain from the top when it is being allowed to flow out the bottom. This is the most common cause of grain entrapments. Regulations issued by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) specifically forbid this at larger commercial facilities subject to them;&lt;ref name="OSHA grain-handling regs"&gt;{{cite web|title=29 CFR 1910.272, Grain Handling Facilities|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9874|publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|accessdate=November 1, 2012|quote=1910.272(g)(1)(iv): 'Walking down grain' and similar practices where an employee walks on grain to make it flow within or out from a grain storage structure, or where an employee is on moving grain, are prohibited.}}&lt;/ref&gt; most smaller farms are not. It may also be necessary to enter a grain storage facility to remove damp, clumped grain (usually from early spoilage) stuck on the walls.&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story" /&gt; Entrapments have also occurred to children in grain transportation vehicles, or to those outside when grain is released from a storage facility or next to large freestanding grain piles.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

Workers in the grain can become entrapped in three different ways. An apparently stable surface may in fact be a "grain bridge" over an area beneath which the grain has already settled. A vertical mass of grain settled against a wall may suddenly give way while being cleared. Moving grain will not support the weight of an average person.&lt;ref name="Caught in the Grain"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher |first=George A. |title=Publication AE-1002: Caught in the Grain! |url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ageng/safety/ae1102w.htm |publisher=[[North Dakota State University]] |date=December 1995 |accessdate=November 1, 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211211454/http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ageng/safety/ae1102w.htm |archivedate=February 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once entrapment begins, it happens very quickly due to the suction-like action of the grain;&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story" /&gt; half of all entrapment victims eventually become engulfed.&lt;ref name="2014 Agweb article" /&gt; A human body in grain takes seconds to sink, minutes to suffocate, and hours to locate and recover. Recovered bodies have shown signs of blunt force trauma from the impact of the grain; one victim was found to have a dislocated jaw.&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story" /&gt;

However, suffocation does not occur from the weight of the grain, rather from the grain itself.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|8}} If a victim's airway remains unobstructed, or they find an air pocket within the grain, they may be able to keep breathing and be rescued. In one instance a trapped person was able to survive for three hours.&lt;ref name="Caught in the Grain" /&gt;

==Rescue==
{{external media

}}
Several factors complicate the rescue of entrapment victims even if their heads remain above the grain. Most grain storage and handling facilities are located on farms in rural areas, often distant from trained rescuers such as fire or ambulance services. They are also [[Confined space rescue|confined spaces, posing hazards to rescuers]].

Foremost among them is the air within.&lt;ref name="Silo Gases - the Hidden Danger"&gt;{{cite web|author=Murphy, Dennis|title=Silo Gases - the Hidden Danger|url=http://nasdonline.org/static_content/documents/1625/d001507.pdf|publisher=Penn State PENNpages|date=July 31, 1988|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon dioxide]] or toxic gases, such as  or [[nitrogen oxide]]s, accumulate from spoiling grain.&lt;ref name="FACE 2009 fatality report to CDC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Madsden, Murray|author2=Ramirez, Marizen|title=Farmer engulfed then asphyxiated by corn in grain bin|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/pdfs/09IA012.pdf|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can cause asphyxiation in great enough [[concentration]]s without proper ventilation of the area. The dust can also sometimes have molds or spores that may be toxic&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|6}} or cause allergic reactions.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|10}} There is at least one documented instance of a first responder requiring treatment as a result of such inhalation;&lt;ref name="Purdue 2011 summary"&gt;{{cite web|last=Riedel|first=Steve|author2=Field, Bill|title=2010 Summary of Grain Entrapments in the United States|url=http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/grainlab/content/pdf/2010GrainEntrapments.pdf|publisher=Agricultural Safety and Health Program, [[Purdue University]]|date=February 9, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; rescuers are advised to wear at least dust masks or even [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA).&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

As soon as an entrapment occurs, in addition to immediately notifying local emergency services, the workers at the facility should shut off anything causing motion in the grain, or close any outlet. The [[aeration]] fan should be turned on to improve ventilation, but without any heat source activated.&lt;ref name="Caught in the Grain" /&gt; Rescuers must always take care not to make the situation worse, or take action that would result in they themselves becoming entrapped or engulfed. They should wear proper safety equipment such as lifelines. No more than two should walk on the surface of the grain at any time.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

Temperature extremes can cause problems for both rescuers and victims. Stored grain is often kept fresh by blowing dry air over it. This, combined with any moisture in the grain, can chill its core to 30–40&amp;nbsp;°F (−1–5&amp;nbsp;°C), creating a risk of [[hypothermia]] for the victim, especially one fully engulfed.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|12}} Conversely, the air within the bin may be warmer than usual due to the heat released by decaying grain, the lack of exterior ventilation (especially on hot days) and any rescue activity; there is thus a risk of [[heat illness]] for those trying to free the victim.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

Even if a living victim is roped, they cannot simply be removed that way. Grain creates friction that resists the force used to pull them out. It requires {{convert|400|lb}} of force to lift a victim buried up to their waist;&lt;ref name="Caught in the Grain" /&gt; removing a human completely trapped in grain takes {{convert|900|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Iowa 2011 alert"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevent Fatalities from Grain Entrapment|url=http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/face/alerts/1011Alert.pdf|publisher=[[University of Iowa]] Department of Occupational and Environmental Health|date=October 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these amounts are above the level that can cause permanent [[Vertebral column|spinal column]] injury.&lt;ref name="Caught in the Grain" /&gt;

Rescues of an entrapped victim usually entail building makeshift retaining walls in the grain around them with plywood, sheet metal, tarpaulins, snow fences or any other similar material available. Once that has been done, the next step is creating the equivalent of a [[cofferdam]] within the grain from which grain can then be removed by hand, shovel, grain vacuum or other extraction equipment. While some of these techniques have been used to retrieve engulfed victims or their bodies as well, in those cases it is also common to attempt to cut a hole in the side of the storage facility;&lt;ref name="Purdue 2011 summary" /&gt; this requires consulting an engineer to make sure it can be done without compromising the facility's structural integrity.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|10}} There is also the possibility of a [[dust explosion]], although none are known to have occurred yet during a rescue attempt.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

==Prevention==

The best way to prevent grain entrapments is to store grain properly. If kept at the proper moisture level of 14% or less and protected from the elements, grain will not form the kind of clumps that create grain bridges or other areas of unequal density within. Entrapments are more likely when grain is more spoiled.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|12}} "Coring" grain by removing some of it from the center after the facility has been filled also reduces spoilage since it generally takes the broken and smaller grains where insects tend to start growing within.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

Strict policies about entering the area where grain is stored further prevent entrapments. Workers should never be alone, but if they must be they should have a radio or cell phone to communicate. Signs indicating the potential hazard should be posted at the entry, and anyone who does not have a good reason to be in the grain should never be there.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

OSHA's regulations require that employees who enter stored grain do so attached to either a lifeline or [[boatswain's chair]], that one other employee be assigned to observe them, and that rescue equipment adequate to the task be available. At farms and [[feedlot]]s not subject to those regulations, it is sometimes common to tie a permanent lifeline to the inside of the storage facility. This has not been found to be effective, as the grain's suction often pulls the victim under the surface too fast for them to reach it, and most are not secured firmly enough that they would not fail under the load.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

==Statistical trends==

Since 1978, the Agricultural Health and Safety Program at [[Purdue University]] in Indiana has documented grain-entrapment incidents. Its National Agricultural Confined Space Incident Database has, as of 2011, records on 900 reported entrapments dating to 1964. The program has analyzed them to find consistent patterns in the hope of improving prevention and rescue efforts. Among the statistically significant patterns it has found are the type of grain in which incidents predominantly occur, the geographic locations of incidents, the type of facility they occur in and the demographics of victims.&lt;ref name="Purdue 2011 report"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Matt|author2=Riedel, Steve |author3=Wettschurack, Steve |author4= Field, Bill |title=2011 Summary of Grain Entrapments in the United States|url=http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/grainlab/content/pdf/GrainEntrapSum2011.pdf|publisher=[[Purdue University]] Agricultural Safety and Health Program|date=March 16, 2011|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than half the recorded entrapments and engulfments have occurred in corn.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Other grains in which victims have become entrapped include soybeans, oats, wheat, flax and canola. Given the predominance of corn as an entrapment medium, most incidents occur in the [[Corn Belt]] states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota and Ohio) where that grain is grown and stored in quantity. Farms in states in the [[Upper Midwest]] and [[Western United States|West]], where humidity is lower and smaller grains are preferred, report fewer incidents.&lt;ref name="Purdue FAQ"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Over 70% of entrapments have occurred on small or [[family farm]]s of the type exempt from OSHA grain-handling regulations.&lt;ref name="Purdue 2011 summary"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Victims have been exclusively male. Three-quarters of them have been farmers, farm workers, or members of farm families. The average age of victims is in the 40s, but a disproportionate share are under 18 (youths 16 or older can work in agriculture without any restrictions).&lt;ref name="Purdue 2011 summary"/&gt;{{rp|3–4}} According to Purdue professor Bill Field, entrapments in vehicles are particularly devastating for farm families, as 95% of the 140 deaths that occurred that way were boys under the age of 11.&lt;ref name="2014 Agweb article" /&gt;

In 2010, the researchers noted that 38 incidents had occurred during 2009, when the national corn harvest set a new record. This was not only the highest since 1993, it capped a period in which the five-year average had steadily increased.&lt;ref name="2009 Purdue report"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Matt|author2=Field, Bill|title=U.S. Grain Entrapments on the Increase|url=http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/grainlab/content/pdf/US_GrainEntrapments.pdf|publisher=Purdue University|date=July–August 2010|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rose to a record-setting 51 in 2010, when a similarly large corn harvest had a high moisture content and low [[test weight]]. Observers speculate that the demand for [[ethanol fuel]] production has fostered the increase of corn in storage.&lt;ref name="World Grain article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reidy|first=Susan|title=Preventing Grain Entrapment|url=http://www.world-grain.com/Departments/Grain%20Operations/2011/5/Preventing%20grain%20entrapment.aspx?cck=1|newspaper=World Grain|publisher=Sosland Publications|location=[[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City, MO]]|date=May 2, 2011|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record entrapments ran counter to the trend of declining accidents in agriculture.&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story" /&gt;

At the same time, more victims are being successfully rescued. Before 2005, a quarter of the victims were saved. Since then, the rate has improved to half.&lt;ref name="World Grain article" /&gt; In 2011, when entrapments declined to 27, only 8 resulted in fatalities.&lt;ref name="Purdue 2011 summary"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==2011 proposed regulations==

After a 2010 entrapment at a commercial [[grain elevator]] complex in Illinois killed two workers aged 14 and 19, while a third survived with injuries, OSHA assessed fines of over half a million dollars against the operators (eventually collecting little over a quarter-million). It sent letters to other grain-handling facilities afterwards reminding them of their legal and moral obligations to prevent such deaths. A year later, after another incident in Oklahoma where two teenaged boys lost legs to a sweep auger, the agency proposed new rules on child labor in agriculture.&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story" /&gt;

They were the most extensive changes proposed in that area in a half-century. Most minors working in agriculture work for farms with fewer than ten employees, which are exempt from most federal workplace-safety laws and regulations. Children who work on their parents' farm are completely outside the scope of those laws, since it is believed that their parents would not let them do hazardous work. The proposed regulations, which took up 49 pages in the ''[[Federal Register]]'',&lt;ref name="Federal Register"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[U.S. Department of Labor]], [[Wage and Hour Division]]|title=Child Labor Regulations, Orders and Statements of Interpretation; Child Labor Violations—Civil Money Penalties|url=http://webapps.dol.gov/FederalRegister/HtmlDisplay.aspx?DocId=25286&amp;Month=9&amp;Year=2011|publisher=''[[Federal Register]]''|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; would have changed that. In its preface to the proposed regulations, the department noted that while agriculture employs only 4% of the country's underage workers, those workers account for 40% of overall deaths on the job.&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story" /&gt;

However, the regulations drew opposition. While they preserved the exemption for small family farms, many observers, even proponents, felt they had overreached in scope and would prevent children of farm families from learning important skills at an early age. Even some of the family members of teenage boys who had died in entrapments told the media that the proposed rules went too far. Opposition mounted in Congress, where it was claimed that the proposed regulations were so broad they could have prevented children from doing chores on their parents' farms. Several [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|senators]] from rural states facing hotly contested elections, such as [[Jon Tester]], [[Claire McCaskill]] and [[Debbie Stabenow]], complained about them personally to President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story" /&gt;

In 2012, the [[United States Department of Labor|Labor Department]] withdrew them, taking the unusual step&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story" /&gt; of indicating, as it did so, that "this regulation will not be pursued for the duration of the Obama administration." Instead, the department said it would continue to work with youth-oriented agricultural organizations like the [[4-H]] and [[National FFA Organization|FFA]] to increase awareness of safe work practices on farms.&lt;ref name="DOL press release"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Labor Department statement on withdrawal of proposed rule dealing with children who work in agricultural vocations  |url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/media/press/whdpressVB3.asp?pressdoc=national/20120426.xml#.UJq3x_UYRXE |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]] |date=April 26, 2012 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also begun levying more and heavier fines for safety violations.&lt;ref name="NYT grain entrapment story" /&gt;

==Internet meme==

Users of the social media platform [[Tumblr]] have, throughout the 2010s, made occasional [[Internet meme|memes]] around grain entrapment. In late 2016, after one popular user reposted to his blog some "choice excerpts" from the [[Wikipedia]] article about grain entrapment along with a video showing a [[mannequin]] sinking in flowing grain, they began to increase. Finally, in October 2017, a Tumblr account dedicated to grain-entrapment memes was created. The most popular ones were widely reblogged.&lt;ref name="Daily Dot meme article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hathaway|first=Jay|title='Grain Entrapment' Is Tumblr's Strange, Scary New Meme|url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/grain-entrapment-tumblr-meme/|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=October 31, 2017|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"One popular way of using the grain entrapment meme," ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' reported, "is as a metaphor for a bad, seemingly inescapable situation." Most commonly, users overlaid screenshots from the video of the mannequin with text metaphorically describing the grain as whatever might be taking up more and more of their time, such as work or the Internet. "But it's gotten to the point where any reference to grain entrapment can be part of the meme, whether it makes sense or not."&lt;ref name="Daily Dot meme article" /&gt;

The ''Dot'' said the Tumblr community's fascination with grain entrapment was easy to understand, as "it's a rare and bizarre way to go". A Tumblr user the website's article quoted agreed: {{nowrap|"[A]nything}} that involves people dying at the mercy of impersonal forces seems to resonate with people in this day and age." The site noted that families who have actually lost a member to grain entrapment would probably not see it as an inside joke. But "it's a phenomenon far enough removed from the lives of most Tumblr teens that they seem to feel comfortable joking about it."&lt;ref name="Daily Dot meme article" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3864">"'''Hey Sandy'''" is a song by the American [[indie rock]] band [[Polaris (band)|Polaris]] which serves as the [[theme song]] for the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] [[television show]] ''[[The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete]]''. It's well-known by fans of the show and the band alike for its lyrics, which are not only nearly indecipherable in the first place, but also have generated considerable debate as to their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2014/10/polaris-pete-and-pete-band/ Ufberg, Max. "Why a Fake Band From a 1990s Kids' Show Decided to Tour This Year" (''Wired'', October 3, 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missing lyric==
The full lyrics were a subject of speculation for several years until they were (mostly) revealed to fans by band members. One line, the third one and the most difficult one to understand, was purposefully left a mystery by head songwriter [[Mark Mulcahy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-polaris-mark-mulcahy-pete-and-pete-echoplex-20150423-column.html Lloyd, Robert. "Critic's Notebook Polaris rising: Mark Mulcahy's 'Pete and Pete' band comes to town" (''Los Angeles Times'', April 24, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1222-how-nostalgia-for-the-adventures-of-pete-pete-revived-miracle-legion/ Danton, Eric R. "How Nostalgia for 'The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete' Revived Miracle Legion" (''Pitchfork'', July 8, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; The song may have referenced the [[Kent State shootings]] and [[Sandra Lee Scheuer]] (being the eponymous "Sandy" of the song), although the actual meaning of the song is in debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4364 Hey Sandy by Polaris (''Songfacts'', 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the DVD set, the subtitles render the third line as "Can you settle to shoot me?", but are not claimed to be an official interpretation of the song's lyrics. 

On the DVD commentary for season 2 of ''The Adventures of Pete and Pete'', one of the show's creators, Chris Viscardi, mentions the missing lyric and says, "I've actually become very passionate about keeping that line a secret." There has been a lot of speculation about the missing line, and most people guess that it was originally kept a secret because ''Pete &amp; Pete'' was a family show.

==Additions==
The [[Music from The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete|full album version]] of "Hey Sandy" contains an introduction with a man speaking the following words:

:''Jupiter, or Thor, is perfect. We need Atlas for our long-distance stuff. The Titan will be even better. They shouldn't have canceled Navaho. Wait 'til you see our submarines with Polaris.''

Besides a reference to the band's name, this sound bite is in fact discussing [[United States]] [[ballistic missile]]s designed during the [[Cold War]]:
* the intermediate-range [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] and [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor IRBM]]
* the [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas ICBM]], the first successful US intercontinental ballistic missile (for "long-distance stuff")
* the [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan family of ICBMs]], successors of Atlas
* the cancelled [[SM-64 Navaho]], an experimental cruise missile developed by the [[U. S. Air Force]]
* the [[UGM-27 Polaris]], a submarine-launched ballistic missile

The initial sample is abruptly cut off and followed by another sample of a radio transmission, ostensibly from a military base:

:''Attention all personnel, this is CVTS. Base vehicle pre-count operations will start on my mark in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...''

There is a cover version of "Hey Sandy" by the [[New Jersey]] band Mister Behavior, as well as by [[California]] [[math rock]] band [[Tera Melos]] on their covers EP Idioms, Vol. I

'''''In Extremis: The Story of Abelard &amp; Heloise''''' is a play by [[Howard Brenton]] on the story of [[Heloise (abbess)|Heloise]] and [[Abelard]], which premiered at the [[Globe Theatre]] on 27 August 2006 with a 15 performance run. The play was directed by [[John Dove (director)|John Dove]] with design by Michael Taylor, and music by [[William Lyons (composer)|William Lyons]].  It was revived for a 2-week run from 15 May 2007 with the same director and most of the same cast.

An early draft of the play was written in 1997 at the [[UC Davis|University of California at Davis]] during Brenton's term as its Granada Fellow, and performed by [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] students of its Drama Department (with Sarah Pia Anderson directing).

==Synopsis==
[[File:In Extremis set.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The set for the second run]]

In twelfth century [[Paris]], a new spirit of philosophical and religious enquiry is growing. Within its vanguard is Peter Abelard, a man of great learning, independence of mind, and sensuality. When he enters into an affair with his equally brilliant but disastrously connected student Heloise, his more conservative enemies find just the pretext they need to discredit him and in so doing start a war of ideas. Through the joy and suffering exhibited in this love story set in the Middle Ages, Brenton explores the relationships between logic and religion, humanism and fundamentalism, and faith and power, and projects modern debates on fundamentalism, the Enlightenment and feminism back on this historical situation.

==Plot==

Abelard, arguing with his teacher [[William of Champeaux]], sets up a new, [[dialectic]] philosophical school of his own, which proves popular and is even fashionable at the royal court of France.  One of his followers is Heloise, with whom he also starts a sexual affair, under the guise of private tuition.  His school's success worries Bernard of Clairvaux, who feels it is subjecting [[divine revelation]] to [[rationalism|reason]] and may thus destroy the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and Christianity itself, but for now he merely subjects Abelard to surveillance rather than opposition.  Bernard and Abelard do meet, briefly, at the court when Bernard goes there to force the king to give back lands he had seized illegally from a French bishop.  Abelard tries to explain that he is not trying to destroy religion but to better understand it through reason using the brain and intellect that God has given him. However, Bernard will not accept this and refuses to accept Abelard's challenge to dispute with him publicly, as Bernard [[dogma]]tically feels he is right and Abelard is wrong and so there is nothing to dispute.

Bernard's agents Alberic and Lotholf reveal the affair to Heloise's uncle and surrogate father Fulbert, a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], and he is disgusted by it.  Abelard offers to marry Heloise to resolve the situation and remove the disgrace, but she refuses, wanting to be his lover rather than conform to the oppressive norm of medieval marriage.  She is smuggled out of Paris to Abelard's sister Denise in Brittany, where she gives birth to their child and waits until two years later Abelard arrives.  They return to Paris and get married secretly in Fulbert's garden, but he then refuses to accept a secret marriage and they flee together to a nunnery where Heloise was taught as a girl.  There they are kept apart in separate rooms, but secretly consummate their marriage on the altar of the monastery chapel.  Abelard is then hunted down and [[castration|castrated]] by Fulbert's cousins in Fulbert's presence, and both he and Heloise are forced to enter monasteries.

Bernard at last accepts the challenge to publicly dispute with Abelard before the king and bishops of France, but this turns into a [[show trial]] when Bernard immediately lists 12 points on which Abelard is heretical and Abelard refuses to answer them, maintaining a complete dignified silence and thus forcing his chief supporter the king to back Bernard and declare Abelard a heretic.  Abelard and Bernard meet, and fail to make a reconciliation, and then Heloise attends Abelard on his deathbed.  After Abelard's death, Bernard burns all of Abelard's heretical works and thus thinks he has won the struggle with him. He then goes to Heloise to affect a reconciliation, but this also fails.  The play then ends abruptly with Heloise anachronistically showing Bernard a 20th-century, [[Penguin Books#Penguin Classics|Penguin]] copy of the couple's letters, to prove that he has not erased Abelard and Heloise from history as effectively as he thought.

The '''International Film Music Critics Association''' ('''IFMCA''') is a professional association for [[music journalism|online, print and radio journalists]] who specialize in writing about [[film score|original film and television music]].

==History and purpose==
The IFMCA was founded in the late 1990s as the '''Film Music Critics Jury''' by film music journalist [[Mikael Carlsson]] (now the owner of film music record label [[MovieScore Media]]), and after period of inactivity was re-launched in 2003 under its new title.

Its membership includes 65 journalists from 16 different countries who write for such high-profile film and soundtrack-related publications and websites as [[Film Score Monthly]], [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]], [[SoundtrackNet]], [[Music from the Movies]] and [[UnderScores]], as well as more mainstream publications such as [[Ain't It Cool News]], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and the [[Irish Times]]. Members of the IFMCA have also been involved in writing [[liner notes]] for major film music record labels such as [[Film Score Monthly]], [[Varèse Sarabande]], [[Intrada Records]], La-La Land Records and [[Music Box Records]].

The aim of the group is to promote original film music and the work of film music composers as legitimate artists worthy of recognition from the mainstream film and music media, and to publicize the work of its members in pursuing this aim. To this end, the group maintains a website documenting its activities; operates a central online review interface which provides links to articles, reviews and interviews written by its members; organizes an annual awards event, the IFMCA Awards, celebrating music for films written during the preceding year; and is involved in organizing major international film music festivals, such as those in [[Tenerife International Film Music Festival|Tenerife]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Home |url=http://www.fimucite.com/f4/en/ |title=Tenerife International Film Music Festival |publisher=Fimucite.com |accessdate=11 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002151/http://www.fimucite.com/f4/en/# |archive-date=11 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Úbeda]] in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://festival.bsospirit.com/en/index.php ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kraków]] in Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmp.org.pl/ |title=Festiwal Muzyki Polskiej |publisher=Fmp.org.pl |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Soundtrack Academy|World Soundtrack Awards]] in [[Ghent]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Poland |url=http://filmmusiccritics.org/members/ |title=IFMCA: the International Film Music Critics Association » Members |publisher=Filmmusiccritics.org |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is responsible for the annual International Film Music Critics Association Awards, the only awards given to composers by active film music journalists, and which are seen by many as a valuable precursor to the [[Academy Awards]] in the absence of a guild for composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incontention.com/2010/01/29/international-film-music-critics-nominees/ |title=International Film Music Critics nominees |publisher=Incontention.com |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been called the "Oscars of film music",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=704788 |title=Araujo, premio IFMCA a la banda sonora de videojuegos por "Lords of Shadow" |publisher=Abc.es |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been featured in major daily newspapers in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/Sinfonias/videojuego/elpepurtv/20110308elpepirtv_1/Tes |title=Sinfonías en el videojuego: Premio internacional para Óscar Araujo por una banda sonora |publisher=Elpais.com |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundoportugues.org/content/1/8810/nuno-malo-eleito-compositor-revelacao-ano-nos-estados-unidos/ |title=Nuno Malo eleito o compositor revelação do ano nos Estados Unidos |publisher=Mundoportugues.org |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are recognized by major performing rights organizations such as [[ASCAP]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/playback/2011/02/Faces_Places/FilmTV/IFMCA_Awards.aspx |title=ASCAP Composers Score at the IFMCA Awards |publisher=Ascap.com |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores|SGAE]] in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgae.es/el-compositor-catalan-oscar-araujo-gana-el-premio-a-la-mejor-banda-sonora-2010-para-videojuego-de-la-international-film-music-critics-association/ |title=SGAE: El compositor catalán Óscar Araujo gana el Premio a la Mejor Banda Sonora 2010 para Videojuego de la International Film Music Critics Association |publisher=Sgae.es |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently have been seen by the video games industry as an important step forward in legitimizing game music as a mainstream creative art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kietzmann |first=Ludwig |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/02/12/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-soundtrack-nominated-for-2-ifmca/ |title=Castlevania: Lords of Shadow soundtrack nominated for 2 IFMCA awards |publisher=Joystiq.com |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eveleth Taconite Co. |vol=130 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1287 |pinpoint= |court=[[8th Cir.]] |date=1997 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/130/1287/634832/ |accessdate=2018-06-14 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first [[class action|class-action]] [[sexual harassment]] [[lawsuit]] in the [[United States]].  It was filed in 1988 on behalf of Lois Jenson and other female workers at the EVTAC [[mining|mine]] in [[Eveleth, Minnesota]] on the state's northern [[Mesabi Range]], which is part of the [[Iron Range]].

==Facts==
Jenson first began working at the site in March 1975 and along with other women, endured a continuous stream of hostile behavior from male [[employee]]s, including sexual harassment, abusive language, threats, [[stalking]] and intimidation.  On October 5, 1984, she mailed a complaint to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights outlining the problems she experienced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights.state.mn.us/ Minnesota Department of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, her car tires were slashed a week later. In January 1987, the state's agency requested that Ogelbay Norton Co.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oglebaynorton.com Oglebay Norton]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619000945/http://www.oglebaynorton.com/ |date=June 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Cleveland, Ohio]]-based part-owner of the mine, pay [[United States dollar|US$]]6,000 in punitive damages and $5,000 to Jenson for mental anguish, but the company refused.

On August 15, 1988, attorney [[Paul Sprenger]] filed ''Lois E. Jenson and Patricia S. Kosmach v. Eveleth Taconite Co.'' in U.S. District Court in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota|U.S. District Court]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]. [[Class-action]] status was requested at the time, and granted by [[James M. Rosenbaum]] on December 16, 1991.  Jenson quit working at the mine on January 25, 1992, and was diagnosed with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] a short time later.

A [[legal liability|liability]] trial began on December 17, 1992, in front of Judge Richard Kyle in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], and six months later, he ruled that the company should have prevented the misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co. |vol=824 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=847 |pinpoint= |court=[[D. Minn.]] |date=1993 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/824/847/1460561/ |accessdate=2018-06-14 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was ordered to educate all employees about sexual harassment.

Patrick McNulty of [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] was named [[special master]] a few months later to oversee a trial that would determine the amount of money owed to the women in damages.  The retired federal magistrate permitted [[lawyer]]s from the mine company to obtain [[medical records]] of all of the women for their entire lifetimes.  Ahead of the trial, the plaintiffs endured long [[Deposition (law)|deposition]]s that explored their personal lives in great detail.

The first half of the trial for damages began in Duluth on January 17, 1995 and lasted until February 10. After a break, it resumed on May 22 and ended on June 13.

On March 28, 1996, McNulty released a 416-page report that called the women "[[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]]," made public details about their private lives, and awarded them an average of $10,000 each. However, the judgment was [[appeal]]ed and reversed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] on December 5, 1997.&lt;ref name=appeal/&gt; A new [[jury]] trial on damages was ordered.

==Settlement==
On December 23, 1998, just before the trial was set to begin, fifteen women settled with Eveleth Mines for a total of $3.5 million.  One of the original plaintiffs, Pat Kosmach, died partway through the case, on November 7, 1994.

The case was documented in the 2002 book ''Class Action'' and a 2005 fictionalized [[film]] version, ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]''.

The festival has its roots in the ancient [[Mesopotamian religion]] practiced by Assyrians until its gradual demise in the face of [[Syriac Christianity]] between the 1st and 4th centuries AD. Today Assyrians are Christians, with most being adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]].

Celebrations involve parades and parties. Some Assyrians wear traditional costume and dance in parks for hours. In Europe, Australia, the United States, Canada and the Caucasus among [[Assyrian Diaspora]] communities, there are often parties with food, music and dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.csusignal.com/media/storage/paper1217/news/2008/03/19/CampusLife/Assyrians.Celebrate.New.Year-3275737.shtml Aimie Rivera.

==History==
In the [[Julian calendar]], the vernal equinox moved gradually away from 21 March. The [[Gregorian calendar]] reform restored the vernal equinox to its original date, but since the festival was by now tied to the date, not the astronomical event, Kha b' Nisan remains fixed at 21 March in the Julian reckoning, corresponding to 1 April in the Gregorian calendar. The [[Vernal equinox]] is celebrated throughout [[Greater Iran]] as ''[[Noruz]]'' meaning "New Day" on 21 March. However, in the ancient [[Assyria|Assyrian]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] and [[Babylonia]]n traditions, the spring festival was celebrated in the first days of the month known as "Nisan"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9hhmzVrYPHAC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=new+year+nisan+akitu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n0nYzub5gc&amp;sig=WTTneJ6-BqOgn-iSzDpUWyDveYw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6F-oSdX_IIzVnQeW6JTaDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result E. Elochukwu Uzukwu. Worship as Body Language: Introduction to Christian Worship : an African. Published by Liturgical Press, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the calendar adopted by the ancient Assyrians had the month "Nisan" at the beginning of the calendar&lt;ref&gt;William Ricketts Cooper. "An Archaic Dictionary: biographical, historical and mythological: from the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Etruscan monuments". Published by S. Bagster and Sons, 1876.&lt;/ref&gt; lending to the term "Kha b' Nisan", or the "first of Nisan".

In the 1950s, a rising upsurge in [[Assyrian nationalism]] resulted in the creation of an official "[[Assyrian calendar]]" with its [[calendar era|era]] fixed at 4750 BC, inspired by an estimate of the date of the first temple at [[Ashur]] in the [[Ubaid period|Middle Ubaid period]]. In the same spirit, the Akkadian name of the spring festival, ''[[Akitu]]'', was revived. It is essential to consider that the Assyrian people have generally celebrated ''[[Akitu]]'' on the first day of April since 4750 BC and that a creation of an official calendar would aim to unite the Assyrians in their nationalism.

The event is also largely celebrated by Assyrians residing in Syria. Although the Syrian government does not acknowledge the festival, Assyrians still continue with the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,46ef83f52,4959de172,0.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, Assyrians in Syria celebrated the event with a mass wedding of 16 couples and over 25,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bethsuryoyo.com/currentevents/6752HomelandCelebration/CelebrationInSyria.html&lt;/ref&gt; After the formation of [[Turkey]], Kha b' Nisan along with the [[Nowruz]] were banned from public to celebrate.  Assyrians in Turkey were first allowed to publicly celebrate Kha b' Nisan in 2005, after organisers received permission from the government to stage the event, in light of democratic reforms adopted in support of Turkey's EU membership bid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/bs/features/setimes/newsbriefs/2005/04/11/nb-10 Assyrians Celebrate New Year for First Time in Turkey (SETimes.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://frazer.rice.edu/~erkan/blog/archives/000235.html Erkan's field diary:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901140718/http://frazer.rice.edu/~erkan/blog/archives/000235.html |date=1 September 2006 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 5,000 people "including large groups of visiting ethnic Assyrians from Europe, Syria and Iraq" took part in the Kha b' Nisan celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[[NYT]] (4 April 2005)[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/04/international/europe/04turkey.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest Assyrian New Year celebration took place in Iraq in 2008. Public celebrations were not allowed by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime prior to the start of the Iraq war. The event was organized by the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] and between 45,000 and 65,000 people took part in the parade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helentalia.com/community.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2008/04.14.08/index_mon.php#goodmorningassyria {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402152316/http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2008/04.14.08/index_mon.php |date=2 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Hon. [[George Radanovich]] of the [[California State Assembly]] recognized the Assyrian New Year and extended his wishes to the Assyrian community in California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulk.resource.org/gpo.gov/record/2004/2004_E00370.pdf Congressional Records – Extensions of Remarks]{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later followed by a letter from the California governor, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], to the Assyrian community in California congratulating them on the annual celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betnahrain.org/Kha-B-Nissan-1.pdf Governor's letter to Assyrian community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208195037/http://www.betnahrain.org/Kha-B-Nissan-1.pdf |date=8 December 2006 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration==
Assyrians celebrate Kha b' Nisan by holding social events including parades and parties. They also gather in clubs and social institutions and listen to the poets who recite the story of creation. The men and women wear traditional clothes and dance in parks for hours.

It has also become tradition to hold a parade down King Sargon Blvd in Chicago, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helentalia.com/community.htm April 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; with the Assyrian organizations, churches, and sometimes businesses, each creating a float and participating in the parade.

It is a tradition in Assyrian villages for girls to gather flowers and herbs which are then suspended under the house's roof. The bunches are referred to as "Deqna d' Nisan",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethsuryoyo.com/currentevents/AGNisan6752/NisanEnglish.html Ashor Giwargis. Al-Nahar Newspaper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4528">The '''Koszta Affair''' (1853) was the name applied to a diplomatic episode between the [[United States]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] involving the rights in foreign countries of new Americans who were not yet fully naturalized.

==Background==
Martin Koszta, a man of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] birth, had taken part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in Hungary|political movement of 1848-49]] for detaching Hungary from the dominion of the [[Emperor of Austria]] (of which it was part). He fled to [[Turkey]] upon the failure of that movement. After a short detention, he emigrated to the United States. In July 1852, he made a declaration under oath of his intention to become a citizen of the United States and, at the same time, renounced all allegiance to any foreign power.

==Abduction==
After residing in the United States for a year and eleven months, Koszta returned to Turkey on private business. He was placed under the protection of the United States by the American consul at [[Izmir|Smyrna]] and the American [[chargé d'affaires]] ''ad interim'' at [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. While waiting to return to the United States, Koszta was captured by Austrian officers and taken by force aboard the Austrian brig-of-war ''Huszár'' and confined in chains. United States officials protested in vain to the Turkish government and the Austrian officers.

Americans learned of rumors that the prisoner was to be transported secretly to [[Trieste]]. Under instructions from the American Minister at [[Istanbul]], [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Duncan Ingraham]] of the United States sloop-of-war [[USS St. Louis (1828)|''Saint Louis'']], which was then lying in Smyrna harbor, on July 2, 1853, threatened to open fire on the ''Huszar'' if Koszta was not surrendered to him by four o'clock. The Austrian [[consul general]] agreed to allow Koszta to be held by the consul general of [[France]] until some agreement with the United States was reached.

==Diplomacy==
On August 29, 1853, Baron Hülsemann, the Austrian chargé d'affaires in Washington, wrote to Secretary of State [[William L. Marcy]], asking for the United States to "disavow the conduct of its agents, ... hasten to call them to a severe account, and tender to Austria a satisfaction proportionate to the outrage."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} He said that Koszta was not a naturalized citizen of the US and had never ceased to be a citizen of Austria-Hungary. Ingraham's threat was thus in violation of international law.

Marcy replied on September 26, 1853, in what is known as the Hülsemann letter. He defended the position of the United States throughout on the ground that Koszta had ceased to be a citizen of Austria even by the law of Austria. His letter said;

&lt;blockquote&gt;that Koszta when seized and imprisoned was invested with the nationality of the United States, and they had therefore the right, if they chose to exercise it, to extend their protection to him; that from [[international law]] – the only law which can be rightfully appealed to for rules in this case – Austria could derive no authority to obstruct or interfere with the United States in the exercise of this right, in effecting the liberation of Koszta; and that Captain Ingraham's interposition for his release was, under the extraordinary circumstances of the case, right and proper.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The letter was published, to great enthusiasm throughout the United States. The State Department's position in relation to the status of immigrants who were not fully naturalized has been endorsed by various well-known authorities on international law.

Koszta was ultimately released by Austria and allowed to return to the United States. The [[United States Congress]] passed a joint resolution of thanks to Captain Ingraham and decorated him with the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], in commemoration of his services.

A '''labour festival''' (labor festival, US) is a festival related to the [[labour movement]] usually occurring annually. Labour festivals are some of the biggest political gatherings in Europe. Often they are outdoors in the summer and (more akin to a [[Fête]]) they incorporate music, (particularly [[brass band]]), parades, film, historical commemoration and food and drink. One of the well-known ones is [[Durham Miners' Gala]] attended by some 100,000 attendees. Some are run by communist or socialist parties such as [[Fête de l'Humanité]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/17/fete-de-l-humanite&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutte Ouvrière (France)#Fête de Lutte Ouvrière|Fête de Lutte Ouvrière]], [[Avante! Festival]], [[Odigitis festival]] and [[Festa de l'Unità|Festa Democratica]]. Some were formerly so, such as  [[Edinburgh People's Festival|Edinburgh Labour People's Festival]]. Some commemorate [[trade unionism]] or history such as [[Burston Strike School]] and [[Tolpuddle Martyrs festival]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/15/tolpuddle-martyrs-festival-record-crowd&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Losar''' ({{Bo|t=ལོ་གསར་|w=lo-gsar}}; "new year"&lt;ref name="Crump"&gt;William D. Crump, "Losar" in ''Encyclopedia of New Year's Holidays Worldwide'' (McFarland &amp; Co.: 2008), pp. 237-38.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a festival in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/holydays/losar.shtml |title=Buddhism: Losar |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=September 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday is celebrated on various dates depending on location ([[Tibet]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Glen Harle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=urbWAAAAMAAJ Thinking with Things: Objects and Identity among Tibetans in the Twin Cities] (Ph.D dissertation: [[Indiana University]], 2003), p. 132: "In Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and other areas where Tibetan Buddhism is practiced, the dates for Losar are often calculated locally, and often vary from region.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William D. Crump, ''Encyclopedia of New Year's Holidays Worldwide'' (McFarland &amp; Co.: 2008), pp. 237: ""Different traditions have observed Losar on different dates."&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday is a [[new year]]'s festival, celebrated on the first day of the [[lunisolar]] [[Tibetan calendar]], which corresponds to a date in February or March in the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name="Crump"/&gt; In 2018,
the new year commenced on the 16th of February and celebrations will run until the 18th of the same month. It also commenced the Year of the Male Earth Dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?ei=DNU_WvDeK4PGmQGEjqaIAw&amp;q=Losar+2018&amp;oq=Losar+2018&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l3.10631.11240.0.11623.5.5.0.0.0.0.90.395.5.5.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.5.392...0i67k1j0i22i30k1.0.Jttk7jiUiVg|title=Losar 2018 - Google Search|author=|date=|website=www.google.com|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The variation of the festival in Nepal is called '''''Lhochhar''''' and is observed about eight weeks earlier than the Tibetan Losar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SB9mAAAAMAAJ Tibetan Borderlands: PIATS 2003]: ''Proceedings of the International Association of Tibetan Studies'', Oxford, 2003, p. 121: "Yet though their Lhochhar is observed about eight weeks earlier than the Tibetan Losar, the festival is clearly borrowed, and their practice of Buddhism comes increasingly in a Tibetan idiom."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-16-20-16, Tibetexpedition, Neujahrsfest Lhasa.jpg|thumb|right|Losar celebration in Lhasa, 1938]]
Losar predates the arrival of Buddhism in Tibet and has its roots in a winter [[incense]]-burning custom of the [[Bon religion]]. During the reign of the ninth Tibetan king, Pude Gungyal (617-698), it is said that this custom merged with a [[harvest festival]] to form the annual Loser festival.&lt;ref name="Crump"/&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] (1998: p.&amp;nbsp;233) frames the importance of consulting the [[Nechung Oracle]] for Losar:
{{Quotation|For hundreds of years now, it has been traditional for the Dalai Lama, and the Government, to consult Nechung during the New Year festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Tenzin (1988). ''Freedom in Exile: the Autobiography of the Dalai Lama of Tibet'' (rev. ed.: [[Abacus Books]], London. {{ISBN|0-349-11111-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tenzin Wangyal]] (2002: p.xvii) frames his experience of Tibetan cultural practice of Losar in relation to elemental celebrations and offerings to [[Nāga]] (Tibetan: ''Klu''):
{{Quotation|During Losar, the Tibetan celebration of the new year, we did not drink champagne to celebrate. Instead, we went to the local spring to perform a ritual of gratitude. We made offerings to the ''nagas'', the water spirits who activated the water element in the area. We made smoke offerings to the local spirits associated with the natural world around us. Beliefs and behaviors like ours evolved long ago and are often seen as primitive in the West. But they are not only projections of human fears onto the natural world, as some anthropologists and historians suggest. Our way of relating to the elements originated in the direct experiences by our sages and common people of the sacred nature of the external and internal elements. We call these elements earth, water, fire, air, and space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] (2002). ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''. Ithaca, New York: [[Snow Lion Publications]]. {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Gumpa.jpg|thumb|right|340px|The [[Gumpa dance]] being performed in [[Lachung]] during the [[Buddhist festival]] of Losar]]

==Practice==
Losar is celebrated for 15 days, with the main celebrations on the first three days.  On the first day of Losar, a beverage called ''changkol'' is made from ''[[chhaang]]'' (a Tibetan cousin of [[beer]]).  The second day of Losar is known as King's Losar ''(gyalpo losar)''.  Losar is traditionally preceded by the five-day practice of [[Vajrakilaya]].  Because the [[Uyghurs]] adopted the [[Chinese calendar]], and the Mongols and Tibetans adopted the Uyghur calendar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tibetan and Buddhist Studies: Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of the Birth of Alexander Csoma De Koros|volume=2| publisher = University of California Press | year = 1984 | isbn = 9789630535731 | first = Louis | last = Ligeti | pages = 344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losar occurs near or on the same day as the [[Chinese New Year]] and the [[Tsagaan Sar|Mongolian New Year]], but the traditions of Losar are unique to Tibet, and predate both Indian and Chinese influences. Originally, ancient celebrations of Losar occurred solely on the [[winter solstice]], and was only moved to coincide with the Chinese and Mongolian New Year by a leader of the [[Gelug]] school of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 10|publisher = Kessinger Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780766136823 | first = James | last = Hastings | pages = 892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Battle of Chamdo|Chinese  occupation of Tibet]] in 1950, Losar began with a morning ritual ceremony at [[Namgyal Monastery]], led by the [[Dalai Lama]] and other high-ranking [[lama]]s, with government officials participating, to honor the [[Dharmapala]] (dharma-protector) [[Palden Lhamo]].&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]], "Losar" in ''Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays, Festivals, Solemn Observances, and Spiritual Commemorations'', Vol. 1 (ABC-CLIO), 2011), pp. 530-31.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Dalai Lama was exiled, many monasteries were dissolved during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Since that time, Tibetan Buddhism practice in Tibet has been somewhat restored, and "Losar is now celebrated, though without the former ceremonies surrounding the person of the Dalai Lama."&lt;ref name="Melton"/&gt;

In Tibet, various customs are associated with the holiday:

{{quote|Families prepare for ''Losar'' some days in advance by thoroughly cleaning their homes; decorating with fragrant flowers and their walls with auspicious signs painted in flour such as the sun, moon, or a reversed [[swastika]]; and preparing [[Cedrus deodara|cedar]], [[rhododendron]], and [[juniper]] branches for burning as incense. Debts are settled, quarrels are resolved, new clothes are acquired, and special foods such as ''kapse'' (fried twists) are made. A favorite drink is ''[[Chhaang|chang]]'' (barley beer) which is served warm. Because the words "sheep's head" and "beginning of the year" sound similar in Tibetan, it is customary to fashion a sheep's head from colored butter as a decoration. Another traditional decoration that symbolizes a good harvest is the ''phyemar'' ("five-grain bucket"), a bucket with a wooden board that creates two vertical halves within. This bucket is filled with ''zanba'' (also known as ''tsamba'', roasted ''qingke'' barley flour) and barley seeds, then decorated with barley ears and colored butter.&lt;ref name="Crump"/&gt;}}

Losar customs in Bhutan are similar to, but distinct from, customs in neighboring Tibet.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;James Mayer, [http://www.festival.si.edu/blog/2013/losar-community-building-and-the-bhutanese-new-year/ Losar: Community Building and the Bhutanese New Year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228080558/http://www.festival.si.edu/blog/2013/losar-community-building-and-the-bhutanese-new-year/ |date=February 28, 2017 }}, [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]], [[Smithsonian Institution]] (February 15, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern celebration of the holiday began in Bhutan in 1637, when [[Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal]] commemorated the completion of the [[Punakha Dzong]] with an inaugural ceremony, in which "Bhutanese came from all over the country to bring offerings of produce from their various regions, a tradition that is still reflected in the wide variety of foods consumed during the ritual Losar meals."&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; Traditional foods consumed on the occasion include [[sugarcane]] and [[green banana]]s, which are  considered auspicious.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; In Bhutan, picnicking, dancing, singing, [[darts|dart-playing]], archery (see [[archery in Bhutan]]), and the giving of offerings are all traditions.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;

==Dates==
The [[Tibetan calendar]] is a [[lunisolar calendar]].  Losar is celebrated on the first through third days of the first [[lunar month]].

In [[computer security]], '''MPack''' is a [[PHP]]-based [[malware]] kit produced by Russian [[Software cracking|crackers]]. The first version was released in December 2006. Since then a new version is thought to have been released roughly every month. It is thought to have been used to infect up to 160,000 PCs with [[keylogger|keylogging software]].  In August 2007 it was believed to have been used in an attack on the web site of the [[Bank of India]] which originated from the [[Russian Business Network]].

Unusual for such kits, MPack is sold as commercial software (costing $500 to $1,000 US), and is provided by its developers with technical support and regular updates of the [[vulnerability (computer science)|software vulnerabilities]] it exploits.   Modules are sold by the developers containing new exploits. These cost between $50 and $150 US depending on how severe the exploit is. The developers also charge to make the scripts and executables undetectable by [[antivirus software]].

The server-side software in the kit is able to customize attacks to a variety of [[web browser]]s including [[Microsoft Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]. MPack generally works by being loaded in an [[HTML element#Frames|IFrame]] attached to the bottom of a defaced website. When a user visits the page, MPack sends a script that loads in the IFrame and determines if any vulnerabilities in the browser or operating system can be exploited. If it finds any, it will exploit them and store various statistics for future reference.

Included with the server is a management console, which allows the attacker deploying the software to view statistics about the computers that have been infected, including what web browsers they were using and what countries their connections originated from.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2759">Within [[Marxist]] theory, modern warfare is described as existing as result of [[Capitalism]]. Marxist theory states that all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and a [[Social class|class system]].&lt;ref name="Einde_2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
The Marxist theory includes the belief that war will only disappear once a Communist [[world revolution]] has occurred, which over-throws free markets and class systems.&lt;ref name="Einde_2007"/&gt;

=== Rosa Luxemburg ===
Marxist philosopher [[Rosa Luxemburg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[Market (economics)|market]]s. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref name="Einde_2007"/&gt;

=== Lenin ===
[[Lenin]] expanded upon Marx’s ideas, providing an analysis of what Lenin described as "[[monopoly capitalism]]". In his theory, Lenin suggested that as capitalism developed as a system, monopoly capitalism was the highest stage of its development.  According to Lenin, “imperialism is capitalism when “the formation of international capitalist monopolies will share the world among themselves and the territorial division of the whole world among the greatest capitalist powers is completed”.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. (1996) ‘Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism’, London, Pluto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way Lenin is suggesting that capitalist powers will cause wars with weaker nations to increase their holding of monopoly capital.  As capitalism develops, its natural progression is for core capitalist nations to exploit those on the periphery through imperialist wars in search of new markets and resources.  Lenin’s theory provided the origins of "[[world systems theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hobden, S. and Wyn Jones, R. (2008) ‘Marxist Theories of International Relations’, in Baylis, J., Smith, S., and Owens, P. (2008) (Eds) ‘The Globalization of World Politics. An introduction to international relations’, New York, Oxford University Press, p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Middlewich Folk and Boat Festival''' takes place in June in [[Middlewich]], [[Cheshire]], [[England]]. The festival builds on the town's [[industry|industrial]] heritage in which [[canal]] [[Narrowboat|boats]] were used to move [[coal]] and other raw materials in the town for the production of [[salt]], and then move the salt out of town, either for use directly, or as a raw material in the manufacture of chemicals such as [[chlorine]] and [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]].

The Middlewich Folk and Boat festival is now firmly established on the folk circuit and it is estimated that 30,000 people visit the town during the festival weekend, along with 400 boats.  The festival was originally organised by members of [[the Middlewich Paddies]], and taken over by the local council in 2011 when the original committee were unable to continue with the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middlewich Folk and Boat Festival saved from sinking by town council|url=http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/news/local-news/middlewich-folk-boat-festival-saved-5609423}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the festival was declared among the top three folk festivals in England by Guardian Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folk on the water at top music festival|work=icCheshireOnline|date=7 May 2008|accessdate=2008-05-07|url=http://iccheshireonline.icnetwork.co.uk/crewechronicle/news/tm_headline=folk-on-the-water-at-top-music-festival&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=20870700&amp;siteid=50020-name_page.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival has been held since 1990.  It was cancelled in 2001 because of [[Foot and Mouth disease]].

During this festival artists appear at venues throughout the town, whilst [[Morris dance|Morris Dancing]] and Craft Stalls also featured. The boating festival centres on the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]]. The main venues where people and boats converge are the Big Lock and Kings Lock, public houses next to locks of the same name on the Trent and Mersey canal.

The '''Mt. Hood Jazz Festival''' was an annual [[jazz]] festival held in [[Gresham, Oregon]], [[United States]]. The festival is produced by the [[Gresham/Mt. Hood Jazz Association]] (GMHJA) which is a non-profit, [[public-benefit corporation]] whose goal is to "promote the appreciation of jazz as a unique American art form." The Mt. Hood Jazz Festival is the signature production of the association, which produces other jazz performances and workshops year round.

==History==
The first festival was held in 1982,&lt;ref name=oregonian2012apr&gt;{{cite news|last=Bingham|first=Larry|title=Gresham Focus: The legacy of the Mt.

The event was held every year through 2009 and featured guests such as [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Tito Puente]], [[Arturo Sandoval]] and [[B.B. King]]. The annual festival resumed August 3, 2013, after a four-year silence.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

'''''Not Tonight''''' is an [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[adventure game]] by British studio PanicBarn, released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in August 2018. Set in an [[alternate timeline]] shortly after the United Kingdom's vote to [[Brexit|leave the European Union]], the player takes the role of a European-born immigrant who must survive under a far-right British government, working as a bouncer across various venues and earning enough keep to avoid deportation. Along the way, the player must make decisions on whether to change the course of events or remain complicit with the new administration.

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay of ''Not Tonight'' is based on the responsibilities of a bouncer, working for Albion ([[England]]) as a citizen of European heritage. As a bouncer, the player must analyse various parts of the guests license checking whether they are under age, provided fraudulent information or have an incorrectly matching photograph. As the game progresses, the player must undertake additional measures as requested by larger venues or by the state. This includes: stopping various nationalities from entering, those who wear certain clothing, individuals who are not on the guest list, people without tickets and various other rules as gameplay becomes more challenging. Additionally, the player can also accept bribes which will gain immediate money at the expense of losing social credit score. Failing to pass a game will lower credit score. A loss of social credit can prevent the player from gaining more jobs and damage their progress. After every mission, the player returns to their flat to interact with characters, pay any outstanding rent and to purchase any items that they may need. While playing the game, the player must make decisions which will affect the story through various characters that can be encountered.

== Plot ==
The game starts with an explosion at a public event with a destroyed [[London Eye]] on the Thames. During the rule of the far right Albion First party, which later breaks from a conservative coalition to form its own government via election rigging, the player is working as a bouncer taking tickets at the British Museum of History celebration event until it is blown up. Soon after the explosion, the game goes back an entire year to when the character must earn enough to prevent his deportation and eviction. The player is referred to as Person of European Heritage #112. The player must spend the year leading to the ultimate events using the BouncR app via the government issued phone to gain employment, all while being monitored by presiding officer, Jupp. The player can make various decision to either support the government or the resistance.

== Reception ==
Not tonight received mixed to positive reviews. Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] has a total review score of 71/100, based on several submissions. Wccftech gave it a positive score of 80. PC Gamer later giving it 71. Screen Rant gave an independent review of 4 out of 5 stars. Trusted Reviews summarized "''Not Tonight'' proves that the ''Papers, Please'' formula can work in a less Soviet setting, but the experience is slightly diminished by the transplant. Yet its eccentricities remain endearing, with characters, landscapes and a haunting sound of muffled music that will be rambling around my skull for a little while yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/not-tonight|title=Not Tonight - PC|last=|first=|date=Aug 17, 2018|website=[[Metacritic]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/not-tonight-review/|title=Not Tonight Review: A Darkly Comic Look At A Dangerous Timeline|last=|first=|date=Aug 17, 2018|website=Screen Rant|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''One Tree Hill'''" is a song by Irish [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]] and the ninth track on their 1987 album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''. In March 1988, it was released as the fourth single from the album in New Zealand and Australia, while "[[In God's Country]]" was released as the fourth single in North America.&lt;ref name="Sams"&gt;{{cite web|first= Aaron |last= Sams |first2= Harry |last2= Kantas |title= U2 – "One Tree Hill" Single |publisher= U2songs.com |accessdate= 25 May 2016 |url= http://www.u2songs.com/discography/u2_one_tree_hill_single}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release charted at number one on the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand Singles Chart]].

The track was written in memory of Greg Carroll, a [[Māori people|Māori]] man the band first met in [[Auckland]] during [[the Unforgettable Fire Tour]] in 1984. He became very close friends with lead singer [[Bono]] and later served as a [[road crew|roadie]] for the group. Carroll was killed in July 1986 in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. Following the [[Tangihanga|tangi]] funeral in New Zealand, Bono wrote the lyrics to "One Tree Hill" in Carroll's memory. The lyrics reflect Bono's thoughts at the tangi and during his first night in New Zealand when Carroll took him up Auckland's [[One Tree Hill (New Zealand)|One Tree Hill]]. They also pay homage to Chilean singer-songwriter and activist [[Víctor Jara]]. Musically, the song was developed in a [[jam session]] with producer [[Brian Eno]]. The vocals were recorded in a single take, as Bono felt incapable of singing them a second time.

"One Tree Hill" was received favourably by critics, who variously described it as "a soft, haunting benediction",&lt;ref name="Pond" /&gt; "a remarkable musical centrepiece",&lt;ref name="Hogg" /&gt; and a celebration of life.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; U2 delayed performing the song on the [[Joshua Tree Tour]] in 1987 because of Bono's fears over his emotional state. After its live debut on the tour's third leg and an enthusiastic reaction from audiences, the song was played occasionally for the rest of the tour and semi-regularly during the [[Lovetown Tour]] of 1989–1990. It has appeared only sporadically since then, and most renditions were performed in New Zealand. Performances in November 2010 on the [[U2 360° Tour]] were dedicated to the miners who died in the [[Pike River Mine disaster]]. During [[the Joshua Tree Tour 2017]] to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the album, "One Tree Hill" was performed at each show.

==Inspiration, writing, and recording==
{{Quote box|quote="They took me up to the top of a place called [[One Tree Hill (New Zealand)|One Tree Hill]], where a single tree stands at the top of the mount, like some stark Japanese painting, and we looked around at [[Auckland|this city]] that's made by craters of volcanoes.

[[U2]] first visited Australia and New Zealand in 1984 to open [[The Unforgettable Fire Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; After a 24-hour flight into [[Auckland]], lead singer [[Bono]] was unable to adjust to the time difference between New Zealand and Europe. He left his hotel room during the night and met some people who showed him around the city. Greg Carroll was part of that group: he had met U2's production manager Steve Iredale and been offered a job helping the band for their upcoming concert on account of Greg's experience with local rock bands. They ended up taking Bono up [[One Tree Hill (New Zealand)|One Tree Hill (Maungakiekie)]], one of the highest – and more spiritually significant to [[Māori people]] – of [[Auckland volcanic field|Auckland's largest volcanoes]].&lt;ref&gt;Stokes (2005), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koot"&gt;Kootnikoff (2010), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Greg worked as a stage hand gently stopping people getting on stage, and was described as "this very helpful fellah running around the place".&lt;ref name="U2157"&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; U2's manager [[Paul McGuinness]] thought Carroll was so helpful that he should accompany the band for the remainder of the tour.&lt;ref name="Stokes"&gt;Stokes (2005), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The group helped him obtain a passport, and he subsequently joined them on the road in Australia and the United States as their assistant.&lt;ref name="Koot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="U2177"&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; He became very close friends with Bono and his wife [[Ali Hewson]], and following the conclusion of the tour, he worked for U2 in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name="U2157" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt;

On 3 July 1986,&lt;ref name="Parra86"&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; just before the start of the recording sessions for ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident while on a courier run. A car had pulled in front of him, and unable to stop in the rain, Carroll struck the side of the car and was killed instantly.&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt; The event shocked the entire band; drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] said, "his death really rocked us – it was the first time anyone in our working circle had been killed."&lt;ref name="U2177" /&gt; Guitarist [[the Edge]] said, "Greg was like a member of the family, but the fact that he had come under our wing and had travelled so far from home to be in Dublin to work with us made it all the more difficult to deal with."&lt;ref name="U2178"&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Bassist [[Adam Clayton]] described it as "a very sobering moment", saying, "it inspired the awareness that there are more important things than rock 'n' roll. That your family, your friends and indeed the other members of the band – you don't know how much time you've got left with them."&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="U2178" /&gt; Bono said, "it was a devastating blow. He was doing me a favour. He was taking my bike home."&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt; He later commented, "it brought gravitas to the recording of ''The Joshua Tree''. We had to fill the hole in our heart with something very, very large indeed, we loved him so much."&lt;ref name="U2178" /&gt; Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and other members of the U2 organisation, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and buried in the [[Tangihanga|traditional Māori manner]] at Kai-iwi Marae near [[Whanganui]], Carroll's hometown.&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parra86" /&gt; Bono sang "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]" and "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]" for him at the funeral.&lt;ref name="Parra86" /&gt;

Shortly after returning to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled "One Tree Hill" after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984.&lt;ref name="Parra86" /&gt; The music was developed early in the recording sessions for ''The Joshua Tree''. The Edge said, "We were jamming with [[Brian Eno|Brian [Eno]]]. He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost [[highlife]], although it's not African at all ... the sound was for me at that time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using a sound like that before then, but it just felt right, and I went with it."&lt;ref name="Hare"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/4269254.html |title=The Secret History of 'The Joshua Tree' |magazine=[[Hot Press]] |first=Colm |last=O'Hare |date=28 November 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2011 |volume=31 |issue=23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62tpK3dK8?url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/4269254.html |archivedate= 2 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as he felt that he could not sing the lyrics a second time.&lt;ref name="Phantom"&gt;{{cite video |title=Interview with Paul McGuinness |people=[[Paul McGuinness]]; John Caddel |publisher=[[Phantom FM]]. Dublin Rock Radio Ltd. |location=Dublin |medium=Radio broadcast |time=5:50 |date=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edge used a [[Bond Electraglide]] guitar to play a solo with a "heavy [[Distortion (music)|fuzz]]" sound at the end of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/u2s-edge-discusses-gear-and-joshua-tree-1987-guitar-world-interview|title=The Leading Edge: U2's Minimal Guitarist Makes It Seem So Easy, But That's Only Because Maximal Thought Went Into It.|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|first=Joe|last=Bosso|date=July 1987|pages=50+|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three musicians from [[Toronto]]—Dick, Paul and Adele Armin—recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. In a six-hour phone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of producer [[Daniel Lanois]], the Armins used "sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument[s]" they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite news |title=Trio gives U2 Raad-ical strings |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=20 March 1987 |page=D14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Armin said, "[U2] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them."&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt; Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Kootnikoff (2010), pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

In the song, Bono included the lyric: "Jara sang, his song a weapon in the hands of love / You know his blood still cries from the ground". This refers to the Chilean political activist and folk singer [[Víctor Jara]], who became a symbol of the resistance against the [[Augusto Pinochet]] military dictatorship after he was tortured and killed during the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="album notes2007"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=The Joshua Tree 20th anniversary edition |others=U2 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Island Records]] |type=Boxset |location=Canada |id=B0010304-00}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono learned of Jara after meeting René Castro, a Chilean mural artist, while on [[Amnesty International]]'s [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the military because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|regime]] that had seized power in 1973 during the coup.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; While purchasing a [[screen printing|silkscreen]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] that Castro had created, Bono noticed a print of Jara.&lt;ref name="album notes2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mueller |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Mueller |date=April 2009 |title=The Joshua Tree |issue=U2 |page=59 |work=''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] Ultimate Music Guide''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became more familiar with him after reading ''Una Canción Truncada'' (An Unfinished Song), written by Jara's widow Joan Turner.&lt;ref name="album notes2007" /&gt;

"One Tree Hill" and ''The Joshua Tree'' are dedicated to Carroll's memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |orig-year=Originally published 14 March 1987 |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Allan |date=April 2009 |journal=The Ultimate Music Guide |issue=U2 |pages=60–69 |publisher=''Uncut'' ||first=Colin |last=Irwin |title=Once, we were asked to set up an audience with the Pope ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=The Joshua Tree |others=U2 |year=1987 |publisher=Island Records |type=Vinyl |id=U2 6 |location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was recorded by [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] and [[Pat McCarthy (record producer)|Pat McCarthy]], mixed by Dave Meegan, and produced by Lanois and Eno.&lt;ref name="release1" /&gt;

==Composition and theme==
{{listen |pos=right |filename=U2 One Tree Hill sample.ogg |title="One Tree Hill" |description=Thirty-second sample of "One Tree Hill" containing lyrical references to Victor Jara and the funeral of Greg Carroll|format=[[Ogg]]}}

"One Tree Hill" runs for 5 minutes, 23 seconds. It is played in [[Time signature|common time]] at a [[tempo]] of 120 beats per minute.&lt;ref name="Sheets"&gt;Chipkin (1999), pp. 69–77&lt;/ref&gt; The song begins with a highlife-influenced riff by the Edge on guitar, which repeats in the background throughout the song.&lt;ref name="album notes2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheets" /&gt; Percussion from drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] enters after two seconds. At 0:07, a second guitar enters. At 0:15, Clayton's bass and Mullen's drums enter, and at 0:31, the verse chord progression of C–F–B{{music|flat}}–F–C is introduced.&lt;ref name="album notes2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheets" /&gt; The first verse begins at 0:47. At 1:32, the song moves to the chorus, switching to a C–B{{music|flat}}–F–C chord progression. The second verse then begins at 1:49, and after the second chorus, a brief musical interlude begins at 2:36, in which the Edge's guitar is replaced by the Raad strings.&lt;ref name="album notes2007" /&gt; The third verse begins at 3:07, and the Edge's guitar resumes at 3:38 in the chorus. A guitar solo begins at 4:16 and is played until the instrumentation comes to a close at 4:36. After two seconds of silence, the Raad strings fade in and Bono proceeds to sing the coda.

Like many other U2 songs, "One Tree Hill" can be interpreted in a religious manner. ''Hot Press'' editor [[Niall Stokes]] called it "a spiritual tour de force", saying "it is a hymn of praise and celebration which described the traditional Māori burial of their friend on One Tree Hill and links it poetically with themes of renewal and redemption."&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt; Beth Maynard, a Church [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] from Fairhaven, Massachusetts, felt the song "vows faith in the face of loss, combining elegiac lines about a friend ... and the martyred Chilean activist and folk singer Victor Jara, with a subtle evocation of end-time redemption and a wrenching wail to God to send the pentecostal Latter Rain."&lt;ref&gt;Whiteley (2003), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Soper, Senior Minister of the West Houston Church of Christ, believed the lyrics were an attempt by Bono to understand God's place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Soper (2010), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Stockman, a chaplain at [[Queen's University Belfast]], felt that the song alluded to "transcendent places beyond the space and time of earth".&lt;ref&gt;Stockman (2005), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Music journalist Bill Graham noted "the lyrics, with their reference to traditional Māori burial ceremonies on One Tree Hill, indicated that the band's faith didn't exclude an empathy with others' beliefs and rituals. Their Christianity wouldn't plaster over the universal archetypes of mourning."&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

"One Tree Hill" was released on ''The Joshua Tree'' on 9 March 1987 as the ninth song on the album.&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt;  Some CD pressings incorrectly split the [[track (CD)|track]]s, with the song's coda included as part of the track for the following song, "[[Exit (U2 song)|Exit]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/u2-exit/|title=U2 Plunge Into Darkness on 'Exit': The Story Behind Every 'Joshua Tree' Song|first=Michael|last=Christopher|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Diffuser.fm]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In New Zealand and Australia, "One Tree Hill" was released as a [[Gramophone record#Common formats|7-inch]] single in New Zealand and Australia in March 1988.&lt;ref name="release1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="release2" /&gt; The cover art (photographed by [[Anton Corbijn]]), sleeve (designed by [[Steve Averill]]), and B-sides ("Bullet the Blue Sky" and "[[Running to Stand Still]]") were identical to those used for U2's 1987 single "[[In God's Country]]", released only in North America.&lt;ref name="release1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=In God's Country |publisher=Island Records |id=IS-1167 |location=Canada |date=1987 |others=U2 |type=12" vinyl}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cassette single]], available only in New Zealand, was also released.&lt;ref name="release3" /&gt; The song reached number one on the [[New Zealand Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="Chart" /&gt; "One Tree Hill" was included as a bonus track on the Japanese version of U2's 1998 compilation album, ''[[The Best of 1980–1990]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=The Best of 1980–1990 |others=U2 |year=1998 |publisher=Island Records |type=CD |id=PHCR–1885 |location=Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Best of 1980–1990#Video|accompanying video compilation]] included the song's [[music video]], directed by [[Phil Joanou]], which features a live performance taken from a previously unreleased cut of U2's 1988 [[rockumentary]] ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Bono]], [[the Edge]], [[Adam Clayton]], [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] |date=April 1999 |title=The Best of 1980–1990 |medium=Videotape |publisher=[[PolyGram]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional live performances were released on the [[Digital distribution|digital]] album ''[[Live from the Point Depot]]'' (2004) and the U2.com member-exclusive album ''[[U22 (album)|U22]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Live from the Point Depot |others=U2 |year=2004 |publisher=Island Records |type=Digital download}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/u2-release-crowd-selected-u22-live-album-via-fan-club/|title=U2 Release Crowd-Selected 'U22' Live Album Via Fan Club|first=Chad|last=Childers|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=7 June 2017|work=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Select editions of the 30th anniversary release of ''The Joshua Tree'' in 2017 featured a [[remix]] of "One Tree Hill" by St Francis Hotel and a new mix of the song's reprise by Brian Eno.&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7717912/u2-joshua-tree-30th-anniversary-edition-bonus-live-tracks-photos|title=U2 Prepping 'The Joshua Tree' 30th Anniversary Edition With Bonus Tracks, Live Cuts &amp; Unseen Photos|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=7 June 2017|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"One Tree Hill" was received favourably by critics. ''Hot Press'' editor Niall Stokes described it as one of U2's best tracks, calling it a "fitting tribute" to Carroll.&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt; The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' felt it was one of the best songs on the album.&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt; Steve Morse of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' compared Bono's vocals at the song's conclusion to the passion of American [[soul music|soul singer]] [[Otis Redding]], also noting that the coda was reminiscent of the hymn "[[Amazing Grace]]".&lt;ref name="Morse"&gt;{{cite news |title=U2's ''The Joshua Tree'': A Spiritual Progress Report |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |last=Morse |first=Steve |date=1 March 1987 |page=B32 |quote=[Bono's] emotional outpouring at the end ... has a passion on a par with peak-period Otis Redding.

It celebrates the life of the spirit not its extinction."&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham (2004), pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', John Rockwell felt that it was an example of U2 stretching their range, saying "the inclusion of musical idioms [is] never so overtly explored before on a U2 record, especially the gospel chorus of 'One Tree Hill'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/arts/u2-makes-a-bid-for-great-band-status.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm |title=U2 makes a bid for 'great band' status |first=John |last=Rockwell |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 March 1987 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61yJl1pKX?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/arts/u2-makes-a-bid-for-great-band-status.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm |archivedate=25 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Hogg of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' called it "a remarkable musical centrepiece", believing it to be the best song on the album.&lt;ref name="Hogg"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10411209 |title=Album review: The Joshua Tree |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=20 March 1987 |first=Colin |last=Hogg |accessdate=1 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wAAtIr2z?url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10411209 |archivedate=1 February 2011 |quote=... not only is it a song that means a lot in this part of the world, but it is the album's finest, saddest melody and its most heartfelt performance, building in urgency until Bono's voice just explodes to the song's climax. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colm O'Hare of ''Hot Press'' said it was "arguably the most poignant, emotionally-charged song U2 have ever recorded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/4269254.html?new_layout=1&amp;page_no=14&amp;show_comments=1 |title=The Secret History of 'The Joshua Tree' 14/18 |first=Colm |last=O'Hare |work=Hot Press |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |archivedate=26 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61zi6VlJb?url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/4269254.html?new_layout=1&amp;page_no=14&amp;show_comments=1 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that it was the "least instrumentally adorned song on the album, resplendent in a feeling of space and openness."&lt;ref name="Hare" /&gt; McGuinness called it one of his favourite U2 songs.&lt;ref name="Propaganda" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4558">'''Les Azuriales Opera''' is an Anglo-French organisation that focuses on finding outstanding young artists and making a significant difference to their early operatic careers. Its activities take place in Cap Ferrat, Villefranche-sur-Mer and London.

== Young Artist Programme ==
Les Azuriales Young Artist Programme, lasting approximately two weeks, takes place each year in August at the [[Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild]] on [[Cap Ferrat]], and the {{ill|Citadelle Saint-Elme|fr}} in [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]], both on the [[Côte d'Azur]] near Nice in France. The programme consists of a singing competition (with prizes of €10,000), public and private masterclasses and an opera performance put together from scratch in a week.

Each year more than 100 singers from around the world are auditioned and 8 to 10 are chosen to become Les Azuriales Young Artists. Les Azuriales has strong links with South Korea, South Africa, Armenia and Russia.

The distinguished givers of its public [[master class]]es and private workshops have included: Lucy Arner, [[Sally Burgess]], [[Peter Coleman-Wright]], [[Michèle Crider]], Sarah-Jane Davies, Peter Kazaras, [[Lyubov Kazarnovskaya|Ljuba Kazarnovskaya]], Elaine Kidd, [[Martin Lloyd-Evans]], Emanuele Moris, [[Dennis O'Neill (tenor)|Dennis O'Neill]], Pedro Ribeiro, Brindley Sherratt and Alessandro Talevi.

A number of its young artists have been winners or finalists of major competitions, including the Montserrat Caballé Prize, the [[Kathleen Ferrier Award]], the Stella Maris awards and [[BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition|Cardiff Singer of the World]].

Seven of its alumni have joined London's [[The Royal Opera|Royal Opera]]’s Jette Parker Young Artists programme. Others have been to the [[National Opera Studio]] (UK), [[Vienna State Opera]] and other prestigious programmes.

Les Azuriales Opera is unusual as a young artist programme in that it provides on going moral and financial support to its young artists.

== Background ==
Les Azuriales Opera is administered almost entirely by volunteers (as opposed to the musical organisation, which is entirely professional). It is privately funded by private and corporate donors.

The structure consists of
* Les Azuriales Opera Trust – a UK registered charity&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1077210&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 Charity Commission entry]&lt;/ref&gt;
* L'Association des Amis du Festival "Les Azuriales" – the official organisation that runs Les Azuriales activities in France: it is an officially registered "Association" (Siret: 440 834 349 00019)
* A Comité d'Honneur whose members provide support and advice. its members are: Richard Salter, [[Vernon Ellis|Sir Vernon Ellis]], [[Antoinette Sibley|Dame Antoinette Sibley]] and [[Christopher Hampson]].

The musical organisation is under the guidance of Bryan Evans, the music director of Diva Opera, who is also Les Azuriales' music director. Sarah-Jane Davies, head of casting at [[Scottish Opera]], plays a key role as artistic consultant and Alessandro Talevi is Les Azuriales' resident guest director.

== History ==
In 1996 Sarah Holford, an English commercial barrister, was introduced to Bryan Evans who had recently founded a chamber opera company in England, Diva Opera. Evans had been presenting chamber opera in country houses and similar venues for many years. With support from Diva Opera in 1997 Sarah Holford founded Les Azuriales Opera Festival principally centred on the [[Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild]] on Cap Ferrat: she had been visiting the area almost every year since she was a child. Diva Opera became the long term opera partner of the festival and itself continues to perform opera in many parts of Europe. Another major contributor was Dominique Lelandais, a resident of St Jean, whose drive and local knowledge were key factors in bringing the festival to life.

In 2003 Les Azuriales started its Young Artist Programme as part of its festival.

In 2015 Les Azuriales ceased to be present an opera festival and changed to its present format with its summer season concentrating solely on its Young Artist Programme,

[[File:Pony Auction during 2008 Pony Penning 001.jpg|thumb|Pony Auction 2008]]

'''Pony Penning''' is an annual event held in [[Chincoteague, Virginia|Chincoteague]], [[Virginia]] on the last consecutive Wednesday and Thursday in July. The [[Chincoteague Fire Department|Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department]] conducts the event and it consists of a Wild Pony Swim on Wednesday and a Pony Auction on Thursday. For the Wild Pony Swim, Salt Water Cowboys round up feral [[Chincoteague Pony|Chincoteague Ponies]] from [[Assateague Island]] and drive them across the [[Assateague Channel]] to Veteran’s Memorial Park on [[Chincoteague, Virginia|Chincoteague Island]].&lt;ref name=Wed-Thur&gt;''Chincoteague Beachcomber''.

''Chincoteague Beachcomber''. "How did the ponies get to the island?", July 25, 2008, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional event in its current form has taken place since 1925 to raise money for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department, but its roots date back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Wed-Thur/&gt;&lt;ref name=How_did/&gt; The event was popularized by the book ''[[Misty of Chincoteague]]'' by [[Marguerite Henry]], published in 1947. It now usually draws from 40,000 to 50,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=Wed-Thur/&gt;

'''Project Mogul''' (sometimes referred to as '''Operation Mogul''') was a [[classified information|top secret]] project by the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Forces]] involving microphones flown on [[high-altitude balloon]]s, whose primary purpose was long-distance detection of [[sound wave]]s generated by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[nuclear testing|atomic bomb tests]]. The project was carried out from 1947 until early 1949. It was a classified portion of an unclassified project by [[New York University]] (NYU) atmospheric researchers.{{R|"Frazier"}} The project was moderately successful, but was very expensive and was superseded by a network of [[seismic]] detectors and air sampling for fallout, which were cheaper, more reliable, and easier to deploy and operate.

Project Mogul was conceived by [[Maurice Ewing]] who had earlier researched the [[deep sound channel]] in the oceans and theorized that a similar sound channel existed in the [[Earth's atmosphere|upper atmosphere]]: a certain height where the air pressure and temperature result in minimal speed of sound, so that sound waves would propagate and stay in that channel due to [[refraction]]. The project involved arrays of balloons carrying disc microphones and radio transmitters to relay the signals to the ground. It was supervised by James Peoples, who was assisted by [[Albert P. Crary]].

One of the requirements of the balloons was that they maintain a relatively [[aerostat|constant altitude]] over a prolonged period of time.  Thus instrumentation had to be developed to maintain such constant altitudes, such as pressure sensors controlling the release of [[buoyancy compensator (aviation)|ballast]].

The early Mogul balloons consisted of large clusters of rubber [[Weather balloon|meteorological balloons]], however, these were quickly replaced by enormous balloons made of [[polyethylene]] plastic. These were more durable, leaked less [[helium]], and also were better at maintaining a constant altitude than the early rubber balloons. Constant-altitude-control and polyethylene balloons were the two major innovations of Project Mogul. 

==Subsequent programs==
Project Mogul was the forerunner of the [[Skyhook balloon]] program, which started in the late 1940s, as well as two other [[espionage]] programs involving overflights and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Union in the mid-1950s, [[Project Moby Dick]] and [[Project Genetrix]].  The spy balloon overflights raised storms of protest from the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stratocat.com.ar/stratopedia/28.htm][https://books.google.com/books?id=uOcrDF0y-CAC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=project+genetrix+soviet+protests&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=79f5vHIoZ7&amp;sig=wPMj-cWNihtujz8Mg-RIYpbcoo0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_EnXUt2mK4OJogTbrILgCA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=project%20genetrix%20soviet%20protests&amp;f=false Project Genetrix and Soviet protests]&lt;/ref&gt; The constant-altitude balloons also were used for scientific purposes such as [[cosmic ray]] experiments.

==Roswell incident==
{{main|Roswell UFO incident}}
In the summer of 1947 a Project Mogul balloon, probably NYU Flight 4 launched June 4, 1947,{{R|"Frazier"}} crashed in the desert near [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. The subsequent military cover-up of the true nature of the balloon and burgeoning conspiracy theories from UFO enthusiasts led to a celebrated "UFO" incident.&lt;ref name=olmsted184&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathryn S. Olmsted|title=Real Enemies: Conspiracy Theories and American Democracy, World War I to 9/11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7Sd5vyOOtEC&amp;pg=PA184|date=11 March 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975395-6|pages=184}} Olmsted writes "When one of these balloons smashed into the sands of the New Mexico ranch, the military decided to hide the project's real purpose." The Official Air Force report (Weaver &amp;amp; McAndrew 1995) had concluded (p. 9) "[...] the material recovered near Roswell was consistent with a balloon device and most likely from one of the MOGUL balloons that had not been previously recovered."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a weather balloon, the Project Mogul paraphernalia was massive and contained unusual types of materials, according to research conducted by ''[[The New York Times]]'': "...squadrons of big balloons ... It was like having an elephant in your backyard and hoping that no one would notice it. ... To the untrained eye, the reflectors looked extremely odd, a geometrical hash of lightweight sticks and sharp angles made of metal foil. .. photographs of it, taken in 1947 and published in newspapers, show bits and pieces of what are obviously collapsed balloons and radar reflectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William J. |date=September 18, 1994 |title=Wreckage in the Desert Was Odd but Not Alien |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/us/wreckage-in-the-desert-was-odd-but-not-alien.html?pagewanted=all   |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York |access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Echoes of Mogul's experimental [[infrasound]] detection of nuclear tests exist today in ground-based detectors, part of so-called [[Geophysical MASINT]] (Measurement And Signal INTelligence). In 2013, this world-wide network of sound detectors picked up the large explosion of the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] in Russia. The strength of the sound waves was used to estimate the size of the explosion.

'''"Second Class Male"''' and '''"Time to Go"''' were a series of 12 [[Parody|spoof]] newspaper columns written by [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] and [[Robert Katz (British writer)|Robert Katz]] under the [[pseudonym]] Richard Geefe in ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1999.

"Second Class Male" was a feature column written by a handsome though ineffectual sort who has a lack of luck in life. After the sixth article, the writer of the column decides that on a certain date he will commit suicide, and the rest of his columns, retitled "Time To Go", will be written about the state of mind of someone knowing they are going to die on a particular date. The last article, consisting of accounts by Geefe's dinner party guests on the night of his death, was published after Morris's co-authorship had been revealed.

The articles were presented as fact and not as a Chris Morris production, although the premise was very similar to a monologue from his ''[[Blue Jam]]'' radio programme, titled "Suicide Journalist" on the ''Blue Jam'' compilation CD. The last pseudonymous column included a man speared by frozen urine and a suicide by repeated jumps from a first floor window, both situations from earlier work by Morris.

The series attacked what some saw as the self-absorption of columnists writing about personal and domestic matters, and the quasi-fashion for columns about dying typified by those written by [[John Diamond (journalist)|John Diamond]] and [[Ruth Picardie]].

According to the [[IMDb]] a 7-minute short film (titled ''Second Class Male'') based on the second column (in which Geefe gets locked out of his flat) was made in 2006.

The '''Security Council of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)''' ({{lang-ru|Совет Безопасности СССР}}) was formed in 1990. The head of this organ was the [[President of the Soviet Union]]; he had the power to elect all members of the council. Article 127.3 of the [[USSR Constitution]] stipulated that the president of the USSR led the Security Council, which would develop recommendations to implement the all-union policy on national defense, state security, economic and environmental security, coping with natural disasters and other emergencies, to ensure stability and legal order in Soviet society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|script-title=ru:УКАЗ: ПОЛОЖЕНИЕ О МИНИСТЕРСТВЕ ЮСТИЦИИ СССР |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yP9ac9ZRsogC&amp;dq | page = 362 |date=21 March 1972 |publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]]|year=1993|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Concert in Central Park''''', released in February 1982 on [[Warner Bros. Records]], is the first [[live album]] by American [[folk rock]] duo [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]]. It was recorded in September 1981 at a free [[benefit concert]] in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], where the pair performed in front of more than 500,000 people. Proceeds went toward the redevelopment and maintenance of the park, which had deteriorated due to lack of municipal funding. The concert and album marked the start of a short-lived reunion for [[Paul Simon]] and [[Art Garfunkel]].
The concept of a benefit concert in Central Park had been proposed by [[Parks Commissioner]] [[Gordon Davis]] and promoter Ron Delsener. Television channel [[HBO]] agreed to carry the concert, and worked with Delsener to decide on Simon and Garfunkel as the appropriate act for this event. Besides hit songs from their years as a duo, their set-list included material from their solo careers, and covers. The show consisted of 21 songs, though two were not used in the live album. Among the songs performed were the classics "[[The Sound of Silence]]", "[[Mrs. Robinson]]", and "[[The Boxer]]"; the event concluded with a reprise of Simon's song, "[[Late in the Evening]]".  Ongoing personal tensions between the duo led them to decide against a permanent reunion, despite the success of the concert and a subsequent world tour.

The album and a film were released the year after the concert. Simon and Garfunkel's performance was praised by music critics and the album was commercially successful; it peaked at number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts and was certified double [[list of music recording certifications|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The video recordings were initially broadcast on HBO, and were subsequently made available on Laserdisc, CED, VHS and DVD.

==Idea and arrangement==

===A concert for the park===
[[File:Simon undGarfunkel10-170.jpg|thumb|View of the stage from deep in the audience]]

New York City's [[Central Park]], an oasis that functions as the city's "green lung", was in a state of deterioration in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="cphistory-1970" /&gt;{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=171}} Though Central Park had been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the start of the 1980s, the city lacked the financial resources to spend an estimated US$3,000,000 to restore&lt;ref name="cphistory-1970" /&gt; or even to maintain the park. The nonprofit [[Central Park Conservancy]] was founded in 1980, and began a successful campaign to raise renovation funds.&lt;ref name="cph-80er" /&gt;

In the early 1980s, [[Parks Commissioner]] [[Gordon Davis]], responsible for New York City's green areas, and Ron Delsener, one of the city's most influential concert promoters, developed the idea of helping Central Park financially with a free open-air concert, under the legal guidance of [[Bob Donnelly]]. The city would use profits from merchandising, television, and video rights to renovate the park. Earlier park performances by [[Elton John]] and [[James Taylor]] showed that this concept could be a success. Davis authorized the project, and Delsener entered discussions with cable TV channel [[Home Box Office|HBO]] to decide who would perform.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|pp=171&amp;nbsp;et seq}}{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}}

They decided on [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], a group that had formed in New York City in the 1960s, and had been one of the most successful [[folk rock]] groups through the late 60s/early 70s.&lt;ref name="billboard 5674" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allmusic t538" /&gt; Simon &amp; Garfunkel had broken up at the height of their popularity and shortly after the release of their fifth studio album, ''[[Bridge Over Troubled Water]]'', which is deemed to be their artistic peak and which topped the 1970 ''Billboard'' charts for ten weeks. They had grown apart artistically and did not get along well with each other. In the following eleven years, both continued musical careers as solo artists, and worked together only sporadically on single projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first= Richie | last= Unterberger | url= http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/simon_garfunkel.html | title= Simon &amp; Garfunkel Biography | publisher= [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] | accessdate= March 1, 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120227123410/http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/simon_garfunkel.html | archivedate= February 27, 2012 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garfunkel made brief guest appearances at Simon's concerts, which were always successful.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|pp=171&amp;nbsp;et seq}}{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}}

Delsener presented the plan to Paul Simon in the summer of 1981. Simon was enthusiastic about the idea, but questioned whether it could be financially successful, especially given the poor audience attendance of his last project, the autobiographical movie ''[[One-Trick Pony (film)|One-Trick Pony]]''. Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|pp=169&amp;nbsp;et seq}}&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt; He questioned whether he and Art Garfunkel could work together,&lt;ref name="billboard 5674" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allmusic t538" /&gt; but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited about the idea, and immediately returned to the US.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|pp=171&amp;nbsp;et seq}}{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}}

From the promoter's viewpoint, Simon and Garfunkel were ideal choices. Not only were they likely to draw a large crowd to the concert, they also had roots in the city{{sfn|Eliot|2010|pp=171&amp;nbsp;et seq}}{{Spaced en dash}} both had grown up and gone to school in [[Forest Hills, Queens]].&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-3" /&gt; Music critic [[Stephen Holden]] pointed out that, unlike artists who had left in pursuit of lifestyles offered by other locales, the two had always been a part of New York City. Both gained inspiration from the cityscape and the cultural variety of New York, and spoke of these influences in their songs.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

===Planning and rehearsals===
Planning and rehearsals for the concert took about three weeks in a Manhattan theater.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}} The rehearsals were characterized by past tensions that resurfaced between the performers under the intense time pressure. Paul Simon later said: "Well, the rehearsals were just miserable. Artie and I fought all the time."&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt; An early concept was for each singer to give a solo performance, with Simon allotted the greater amount of time, and to conclude with the duo performing their joint works. This idea was rejected because, according to Garfunkel, "It didn't seem right to either of us that Paul should be the opening act for Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and for him to follow Simon &amp; Garfunkel didn't make show-business sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Victoria Kingston | title= Simon &amp; Garfunkel: The Biography | edition= 2. | publisher= Fromm International | year= 2000 | isbn= 978-0-88064-246-0 | page= 236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two decided to perform most of the show together, with room for each to showcase some solo material.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}}  Simon, who had resumed songwriting after a long hiatus, interrupted a series of studio recording sessions for the concert preparations. He used the live show as an opportunity to test one of his new songs in front of an audience. Garfunkel also planned to present a new song, "A Heart in New York", from his soon-to-be released album ''[[Scissors Cut]]''.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}}

[[File:Concert in Central Park - Doret poster.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Michael Doret]] poster for the concert]]
The two differed on the presentation of the concert. Garfunkel wanted to recreate the duo's mid-1960s live performances, using only their voices backed by Simon's [[acoustic guitar]]. Simon felt that this was impossible, as an injury had rendered him incapable of playing guitar for the full length of a concert, and his newer material was typically arranged for larger ensembles that often included [[Horn section|horns]] and amplified instruments such as [[Fender Rhodes|electric piano]] and electric guitar. Garfunkel initially agreed to hire a second guitarist, but later rejected the idea. A group of eleven musicians was assembled for the concert,&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt;{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=138}} most of whom were experienced studio musicians and had played on albums involving Simon or Garfunkel and these included [[Billy Joel]]'s guitarist David Brown (guitar), [[Muscle Shoals]] guitarist [[Pete Carr]] (guitar), [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] (bass guitar), [[Rob Mounsey]] (synthesizer), John Eckert (trumpet), John Gatchell (trumpet), Dave Tofani (saxophone), [[Gerry Niewood]] (saxophone), [[Steve Gadd]] and [[Grady Tate]] (drums, percussion), and [[Richard Tee]] (piano).{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=174}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/Simon-Garfunkel-The-Concert-In-Central-Park/release/1274592&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical arrangements for the concert were written by Paul Simon and [[David Matthews (keyboardist)|David Matthews]]. Some songs differed significantly from their original versions; for example, "[[Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard]]" featured more prominent [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] elements and included a [[Salsa music|salsa]] [[Break (music)|break]], while the folk rock "[[Kodachrome (song)|Kodachrome]]" was set as a harder rock song and played together with the [[Chuck Berry]] classic "[[Maybellene]]" as a [[medley (music)|medley]]. The military rhythm of "[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]" was replaced with a Latin arrangement that included [[brass instruments|brass]].&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

Garfunkel had difficulties in the rehearsals. Both men easily recalled their songs from the 1960s, but Garfunkel had to learn the harmonies and arrangements for Simon's solo songs, as modified for the reunion concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/the-concert-in-central-park-r18004|publisher=AllMusic (Rovi Corporation)|accessdate=April 18, 2012|title=The Concert in Central Park&amp;nbsp;– Simon &amp; Garfunkel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007053001/http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-concert-in-central-park-r18004|archive-date=October 7, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also uncomfortable that Simon had rewritten some of the lyrics for their old songs. Despite the need to adapt to Simon and his style, Garfunkel enjoyed some of the songs, and was glad to perform a duet version of Simon's "[[American Tune]]".{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=138}}

==Concert==
[[File:Simon and Garfunkel 10-146.jpg|thumb|The audience waits on the "Great Lawn" for the concert's beginning]]
The concert took place on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond|Great Lawn]], the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many carrying chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=139}} The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees.&lt;ref name="nyt-1" /&gt; Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert,&lt;ref name="nyt-3" /&gt; an estimated 500,000 audience members{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=174}} made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://read.mtvhive.com/2011/09/19/hive-five-big-concerts-with-big-draws/ | first= Rebecca | last= Raber | title= Hive Five: Big Concerts With Big Draws | publisher= [[MTV]] | date= September 19, 2011 | accessdate= December 12, 2011 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110924181131/http://read.mtvhive.com/2011/09/19/hive-five-big-concerts-with-big-draws/ | archivedate= September 24, 2011 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline.  At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, [[Ed Koch]], who announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!"{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=139}} The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands,{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=174}} and began the concert with their 1968 hit "[[Mrs. Robinson]]".

After the second song, "[[Homeward Bound (song)|Homeward Bound]]", Simon delivered a short speech which began, "Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert." He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued.

Simon &amp; Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of  [[The Everly Brothers]]' "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]", and the medley version of "Maybellene". Each performer sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece. Garfunkel sang the Simon &amp; Garfunkel classic "[[Bridge Over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge Over Troubled Water]]" and "April Come She Will", and "A Heart in New York", a song written by [[Gallagher and Lyle]] that appeared on his album ''Scissors Cut'', which had been released the previous month. Simon's solo performances were the title song of his 1975 album ''[[Still Crazy After All These Years]]'', the number-one single "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover", and the unreleased "[[The Late Great Johnny Ace]]", which would appear on his 1983 album ''[[Hearts and Bones]]''.

"The Late Great Johnny Ace" was interrupted when an audience member ran to the stage and shouted at Simon: "I need to talk to you!" The man was carried away by security, and Simon finished the song. The incident provoked associations to the song's lyrics, in which Simon speaks as a first-person narrator concerning the deaths of [[Johnny Ace]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[John Lennon]]. [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon's murder]] by [[Mark David Chapman|an obsessed fan]] had taken place less than a year previously, not far from the concert site.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|pp=140&amp;nbsp;et seq}}{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=175}} Despite this association, Simon said that he was not afraid of any on-stage incidents. In May 1982 as a guest on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', he explained that while it is not unusual for fans, for example, to jump onto the stage with flowers, this action was new to him, but also felt that the man simply appeared intoxicated. His greater concern was that the song's premiere was ruined.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=141}}

Lyrics referring to the New York area produced audience applause, such as Garfunkel's [[ode]] to his home city, "A Heart in New York", which describes from a New Yorker's point of view the first glimpse of the city when returning there by air:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/news/central-park-news/great-music-great-memories.html | title= Great Music, Great Memories&amp;nbsp;– Great Lawn | publisher= [[Central Park Conservancy]] | accessdate= February 27, 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120307092050/http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/news/central-park-news/great-music-great-memories.html | archivedate= March 7, 2012 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applause broke out during "[[The Sound of Silence]]", when the narrative voice refers to a large crowd of people in the dark:&lt;ref name="cdstarts" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people maybe more&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.simonandgarfunkel.com/us/music/sounds-silence/sound-silence | publisher= [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] Official Website | title= The Sound of Silence Lyrics | accessdate= February 27, 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110408034745/http://www.simonandgarfunkel.com/us/music/sounds-silence/sound-silence | archivedate= April 8, 2011 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the 17th song, "[[The Boxer]]", which contained an additional stanza not included in the album version, Simon &amp; Garfunkel thanked the audience and left the stage, but returned to deliver an encore of three songs&amp;nbsp;– "Old Friends / Bookends Theme", "The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)" and "The Sound of Silence". Simon then said that their planned use of pyrotechnics had been disallowed, and told the crowd, "Let's have our own fireworks!" Many spectators sparked lighters. The duo then introduced the members of the backing band and gave a final encore, a reprise of "[[Late in the Evening]]".{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=141}}

==Release==
A recording of the concert was released five months later, on February 16, 1982.  The audio tracks were processed in [[postproduction]], but ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine wrote that they were not completely polished, and preserved the roar and the fuzziness of live rock music heard through a [[loudspeaker]].&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Two songs were not included on the album: the interrupted "Late Great Johnny Ace", and the encore reprise of "Late in the Evening". The album was an international success.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=145}} It peaked at number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, and was certified 2×Multi-Platinum with sales of over 2 million copies in USA. The album sold more than 1,270,000 copies in France, where it was certified Diamond. It was also successful in seven other countries, including France and [[New Zealand]]. The album was released as a double [[LP album|LP]] and as a single [[Compact Cassette]]. In 1988 it was issued as a single [[CD]]. Various reissues in different formats have occurred, including, alongside the DVD, a 2-CD-release also containing the two missing songs from the original album.&lt;ref name="Releases" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Simon-Garfunkel-The-Concert-In-Central-Park/master/27817|title= Simon &amp; Garfunkel – The Concert In Central Park |publisher=Discogs|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video release===
The concert was filmed for television broadcast and the home video market. It was produced by [[James Signorelli]], and directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]], a specialist in music documentaries who had worked on [[The Beatles]]' film ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', and executive produced by [[Lorne Michaels]], who had recently departed the [[NBC]]-TV comedy/variety series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Simon himself financed the US$750,000 cost of the staging and the video recording.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=139}} It is unknown how much [[HBO]] paid for the television and video rights of the recording; US$1 million according to some sources,{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=174}}{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=175}} over US$3 million according to others.&lt;ref name="pileggi-32" /&gt; The film includes the two songs that had not appeared on the album, and at 87-minutes, runs 12 minutes longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/44773/Simon-and-Garfunkel-The-Concert-in-Central-Park/overview | title= Simon and Garfunkel: The Concert in Central Park (1982) | work= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate=December 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HBO televised the film, ''Simon and Garfunkel: The Concert in Central Park'', on February 21, 1982, five days after the album was released. The film was later released for sale in [[Video Home System|VHS]], [[CED Videodisc]], [[Laserdisc]],&lt;ref name="discogs1611479" /&gt; and [[DVD]] formats.&lt;ref name="swr3" /&gt; It sold more than 50,000 copies in the US, where it earned [[Recording Industry Association of America#Video Longform certification|Gold]] certification for a music longform video.&lt;ref name="riaa" /&gt; It was broadcast on [[PBS television|PBS]] on August 22, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.csmonitor.com/1988/0818/lwn18.html Christian Science Monitor - Worth Noting on TV, August 18, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; and again on August 8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20150702pbs20/ The Futon Critic - PBS Special #SGCP]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concert and recordings were positively received by music critics. Stephen Holden praised the performance in ''[[The New York Times]]'' the day after the concert;&lt;ref name="nyt-2" /&gt; he subsequently praised the live album in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; He wrote that Simon and Garfunkel were successful in reviving their sound, that the backing band was "one of the finest groups of musicians ever to play together at a New York rock concert",&lt;ref name="nyt-2" /&gt; and the rearrangements of Simon's solo material were improvements over the originals.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Despite the risks in performing so many acoustic ballads in an open-air concert on a cool night, the songs "were beautifully articulated, in near-perfect harmony."&lt;ref name="nyt-2" /&gt;

An October 1981 review in ''Rolling Stone'' called the concert "one of the finest performances of [1981]", one that "vividly recaptured another time, an era when well-crafted, melodic pop bore meanings that stretched beyond the musical sphere and into the realms of culture and politics."&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone 1981-10-29" /&gt; This reviewer noted that Garfunkel's voice was noticeably restrained in high passages, though still harmonious, and that the evening's only weak spot was the "Kodachrome"/"Maybellene" medley, because neither singer could raise the right level of emotion for the rock songs.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone 1981-10-29" /&gt; A ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' reviewer wrote in March 1982, "This 19 song, two record set gloriously recaptures the past with sterling renditions of most of the duo's classics as well as a few of Simon's solo compositions filled out by Garfunkel's harmony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Simon &amp; Garfunkel&amp;nbsp;– The Concert in Central Park | work= [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]] | date= March 6, 1982 | page= 73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Robert Christgau]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' dismissed the album as "a corporate boondoggle—a classy way for Warner Bros. artist Simon to rerecord, rerelease, and resell the catalogue CBS is sitting on." He felt Simon had been better off without Garfunkel since 1971 and quipped, "live doubles are live doubles, nostalgia is nostalgia, wimps are wimps, and who needs any of 'em?"&lt;ref name="Christgau"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The duo were disappointed with their performance, particularly Garfunkel, who felt that he sang poorly. Simon said that he did not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: "I didn't get what had happened&amp;nbsp;– how big it was&amp;nbsp;– until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. Then I got it."&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt;

In May 1982, Simon &amp; Garfunkel went on a world tour with stops in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, the US and Canada.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=178}} The European leg of their tour began on May 28, 1982, at the [[Stadion am Bieberer Berg]] in [[Offenbach am Main]]. This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|pp=145&amp;nbsp;et seq}}

When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon &amp; Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled ''Think Too Much'', with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&amp;G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album ''[[Hearts and Bones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/paulsimon/albums/album/112553/review/5942599/hearts_and_bones |title=Paul Simon: Hearts And Bones : Music Reviews |first=Don |last=Shewey |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 24, 1983 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717052350/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/paulsimon/albums/album/112553/review/5942599/hearts_and_bones |archivedate=July 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 4, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years would pass before Simon &amp; Garfunkel worked together again. Their next joint public appearance was in 1990, when they performed for their induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. When Simon gave another free concert in Central Park on August 15, 1991,{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=129}} he rejected Garfunkel's offer to participate.&lt;ref name="nyt-3" /&gt; However, they agreed to perform together in 1993 for 21 sold out concerts in New York, with half of the show being Paul Simon solo with a band and the other half Simon and Garfunkel. Later the same year, they did some charity concerts, including the [[Bridge School Benefit]] concerts and a benefit for [[United Way of Canada]] Children's Charities at [[SkyDome]] in [[Toronto]]. Their next performance as a duo was in December 2003, at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] during the [[Old Friends Tour]]. This concert was recorded, and released in December 2004 as the album ''[[Old Friends: Live on Stage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Ray |last=Waddel | title= Friends Again. Simon and Garfunkel Reunite For Tour | publisher= [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]| date= September 20, 2003 | pages= 6, 79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ''Concert in Central Park'' raised around $51,000 for Central Park.&lt;ref name="pileggi-32" /&gt; Benefit concerts by other musicians followed, and helped to raise awareness of the park's state. With donations from the general public and with the help of wealthy benefactors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| first= Elizabeth |last=Barlow | title= Central Park's Renaissance | work= [[New York Magazine]]| date= June 6, 1983 | pages= 32&amp;nbsp;et seq | url= https://books.google.com/?id=s8EBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Central+Park%E2%80%99s+Renaissance#v=onepage&amp;q=Central%20Park%E2%80%99s%20Renaissance&amp;f=false | accessdate=January 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the park was restored during the 1980s and gained recognition as a major tourist attraction.&lt;ref name="cph-80er" /&gt; As of 2011, donations still make up the majority of its budget.&lt;ref name="newyork.ch" /&gt; Today concerts and other benefits are regularly held on the Great Lawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/ | title= About the Central Park Conservancy | publisher= [[Central Park Conservancy]] | accessdate=December 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tim Field''' (24 April 1952 in [[Eastbourne]] - 15 January 2006) was a prominent British anti-[[bullying]] activist with his main focus relating to [[workplace bullying]]. He was the author of two books, and he coined the term "[[bullycide]]".

==Early life==
Tim Field was born on 24 April 1952 in Eastbourne, England. From 1971 to 1975 he studied [[computing science]] in [[Stafford]] at the North Staffordshire Polytechnic, now [[Staffordshire University]], and was awarded a First Class Honours degree.

==Career==
Field worked in the computer industry for nineteen years until he had to stop due to the effects of experiencing severe workplace bullying.

In 1996, Field founded the UK National Workplace Bullying Advice Line and the ''Success Unlimited'' website. He wrote and self-published a book "Bully In Sight" based on his own experiences, and impressions of calls to the advice line in 1996. First published with the long title "Bully In Sight - How to predict, resist, challenge and combat workplace bullying" the first ten chapters of the book seek to define [[bullying]] and bullies. the second part offers suggestions on how to challenge and combat workplace bullying.

As a result of the expense and effort of defending himself against a libel action, in early 2004, Field closed down the National Workplace Bullying Advice Line and ''Bullying Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobullyforme.yuku.com/topic/366/Even-sadder-news-from-Tim-Field#.Uw4Q7s5FXOc No Bully For Me, February 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life, death and legacy==
In July 1978 Field married Susan Mitchener, who he had met as a fellow-student at N. Staffs. Polytechnic. They had two children.

Field died from cancer on 15 January 2006 aged 53.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;Field, T, et al.

Tim Field set up [http://www.bullyonline.org www.bullyonline.org] to inform people about workplace bullying.  In 2015 the Tim Field Foundation was established as a UK registered charity to maintain this website and further Tim Field's cause against bullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timfieldfoundation.org Tim Field Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F083821-0005, Bonn, Auswärtiges Amt, 2-4 Verhandlungen.jpg|thumb|Participants in the first round of talks conducted in March 1990 to negotiate the treaty]]
On 2 August 1945, the [[Potsdam Agreement]], promulgated at the end of the [[Potsdam Conference]], among other things agreed on the initial terms under which the [[Allies of World War II]] would govern Germany. A provisional German–Polish border known as the [[Oder–Neisse line]] awarded, in theory within the context of that "provisional border", most of Germany's eastern provinces to [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Those agreements reached were provisional and the agreement stipulated that the situation would be finalised by "a peace settlement for Germany to be accepted by the Government of Germany when a government adequate for the purpose is established" (Potsdam Agreement 1.3.1). Parts of those above-mentioned agreements were burdened with controversy from several sources e.g., Churchill's comment about "stuffing the Polish goose too full" (of German lands). The overall "German Question" became one of the salient and crucial issues of the long-running [[Cold War]], and until it ended in the late 1980s, little progress had been made in the establishment of a single government of Germany adequate for the purpose of agreeing to a final settlement. This meant that in some respects (largely, but not only, technical), Germany did not have full national [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="Zelikow"/&gt;{{rp|42–43}}

Several developments in 1989 and 1990, collectively termed [[Die Wende]] and the [[Peaceful Revolution]], led to the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the collapse of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] in the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR or East Germany). In the [[East German general election, 1990|18 March 1990 national election in the GDR]] an electoral alliance of parties that favored [[German reunification]] via article 23 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] won a plurality.&lt;ref name="Zelikow"/&gt;{{rp|229–232}}&lt;ref name="Maier"&gt;[[Charles S. Maier]], ''Dissolution: The Crisis of Communism and the End of East Germany'' (Princeton University Press, 1997). {{ISBN|978-0691007465}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|211–214}} To achieve unity and full sovereignty, both German states were willing to accept the terms of the Potsdam Agreement that affected Germany.&lt;ref name="Zelikow"/&gt; It was then possible for all international parties to negotiate a final settlement.&lt;ref name="Zelikow"/&gt;

== Treaty ==
[[File:Unterschriften 2+4.jpg|thumb|The signatures of the representatives of the four powers on the final treaty]]
The Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was signed in [[Moscow]], Soviet Union, on 12 September 1990,&lt;ref name="Zelikow"&gt;[[Philip Zelikow]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]]. Germany Unified and Europe Transformed: A Study in Statecraft. Harvard University Press, 1995 &amp; 1997. {{ISBN|9780674353251}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|363}} and paved the way for [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/AAmt/PolitischesArchiv/EinblickeArchiv/ZweiPlusVier_node.html&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the treaty, the Four Powers renounced all rights they formerly held in Germany, including those regarding the city of [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Zelikow"/&gt; Upon deposit of the last instrument of ratification, united Germany became fully [[sovereign state|sovereign]] on 15 March 1991.

The treaty allows Germany to make and belong to alliances, without any foreign influence in its politics. All Soviet forces were to leave Germany by the end of 1994. Before the Soviets withdrew, Germany would only deploy territorial defense units not integrated into the alliance structures. German forces in the rest of Germany were assigned to areas where Soviet troops were stationed. After the Soviets withdrew, the Germans could freely deploy troops in those areas, with the exception of nuclear weapons. For the duration of the Soviet presence, Allied troops would remain stationed in Berlin upon Germany's request.&lt;ref name="Zelikow"/&gt;

Germany undertook to reduce its [[armed forces]] to no more than 370,000 personnel, no more than 345,000 of whom were to be in the [[German Army|Army]] and the [[German Air Force|Air Force]]. These limits would commence at the time that the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] would enter into force, and the treaty also took note that it was expected that the other participants in the negotiations would "render their contribution to enhancing security and stability in Europe, including measures to limit personnel strengths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/2plusfour8994e.htm|title=German-American Relations - Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (two plus four)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany also reaffirmed its renunciation of the manufacture, possession of, and control over nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and in particular, that the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] would continue to apply in full to the unified Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany). No foreign armed forces, nuclear weapons, or the carriers for nuclear weapons would be stationed or deployed in [[new states of Germany|six states]] (the area of Berlin and the former East Germany), making them a permanent [[Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone]]. The German Army could deploy conventional weapons systems with nonconventional capabilities, provided that they were equipped and designed for a purely conventional role. Germany also agreed to use military force only in accordance with the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref name="Zelikow"/&gt;

Another of the treaty's important provisions was Germany's confirmation of the by now internationally recognised border with Poland, and other territorial changes in Germany that had taken place since 1945, preventing any future claims to lost territory east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] (see also [[Former eastern territories of Germany]]) which had historically been part of Germany for centuries before 31 December 1937. The treaty defined the territory of a 'united Germany' as being the territory of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin, prohibiting Germany from making any future territorial claims. Germany also agreed to sign a separate treaty with Poland reaffirming the present common border, binding under international law, effectively relinquishing these territories to Poland. This was done on 14 November 1990 with the signing of the [[German–Polish Border Treaty (1990)|German-Polish Border Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Zelikow"/&gt; Furthermore, the Federal Republic was required by the treaty to amend its Basic Law so as to be constitutionally prohibited from accepting any application for incorporation into Germany from territories outside the territories of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin.

Although the treaty was signed by West and East Germany as separate sovereign states, it was subsequently also [[ratification|ratified]] by united Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany).

== Implementation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved itself]] in December 1991, the command unit of the Soviet [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]] devolved to the [[Russian Federation]]. The German government subsequently recognized the Russian Federation's claim to be the [[succession of states|continuator state]] of the Soviet Union, including the right to maintain troops in Germany until the end of 1994. However, with post-Soviet Russia facing severe economic hardship, President [[Boris Yeltsin]] ordered Russian troop deployment in Germany to be reduced to levels significantly below those permitted in the Treaty. The last Russian troops left Germany at the end of August in 1994, four months before the treaty deadline.

In the first decade of the 21st century, the [[Bundeswehr]] underwent a gradual transformation to a fully professional force. By 2011, the year Germany voluntarily suspended [[conscription]], the Bundeswehr had retained fewer than 250,000 active duty personnel – barely two thirds of the country's treaty limit of 370,000.

== Claimed violations ==

The treaty has been alleged to have been violated on a number of occasions. In 2006, [[German News Information Services GmbH|German News Information Services]] argued that "an international lawsuit should be initiated against the development of installations at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig Airport]] in preparation for service in [[NATO]] and [[European Union|EU]] [[Military operation|combat missions]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.german-foreign-policy.com/en/fulltext/55981|title=www.german-foreign-policy.com|work=german-foreign-policy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, manoeuvres including NATO-troops in [[Trollenhagen]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in the area of the former East Germany have also been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jungewelt.de/2010/01-08/041.php NATO übt in Trollenhagen] Tageszeitung junge Welt, 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=January 2010}} Under one interpretation of the treaty, only German forces may be deployed in the area of the former East Germany.{{dubious|date=May 2015}}&lt;!--dubious: see [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000017586078;view=1up;seq=26] and also Zelkow/Rice pp 361-362--&gt; In September 2007, France offered Germany joint control over its nuclear arsenal, but the Germans rejected this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ueberraschender-vorstoss-sarkozy-bot-deutschland-atomwaffen-an-a-505887.html|title=Überraschender Vorstoß: Sarkozy bot Deutschland Atomwaffen an|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eastward expansion of NATO ===
Historian [[Stephen F. Cohen]] asserted in 2005 that a commitment was given that NATO would never expand further east,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/gorbachevs-lost-legacy Gorbachev's Lost Legacy] by [[Stephen F. Cohen]] ([[The Nation]], February 24, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[Robert Zoellick]], then a [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process, this appears to be a misperception; no formal commitment of the sort was made.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Zoellick, [https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=download&amp;did=32105&amp;kod=JMM352 The Lessons of German Unification], [[The National Interest]], September 22, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May 2008 the former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], in an interview with the British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', stated his view that such a commitment had been made:

{{quote|The Americans promised that NATO wouldn't move beyond the boundaries of Germany after the Cold War but now half of central and eastern Europe are members, so what happened to their promises? It shows they cannot be trusted.&lt;ref name="me"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1933223/Gorbachev-US-could-start-new-Cold-War.html "Gorbachev: US could start new Cold War"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 6 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, in a 2014 interview Gorbachev reversed himself by saying that the topic of "NATO expansion" as such was "not discussed at all", although he maintained that the decision to expand NATO into the east was a "violation of the spirit of the statements and assurances made to us in 1990".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/international/2014/10/16/mikhail_gorbachev_i_am_against_all_walls_40673.html|title=Mikhail Gorbachev: I am against all walls|date=16 October 2014|work=Russia Beyond the Headlines|first=Maxim|last=Kórshunov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that such a commitment was not made during the discussions on German reunification.&lt;ref name=TWQ&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Mark|title=The Myth of a No-NATO-Enlargement Pledge to Russia|journal=[[The Washington Quarterly]]|date=April 2009|volume=32|issue=2|pages=39-61|doi=10.1080/01636600902773248|url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/twq-myth-no-nato-enlargement-pledge-russia-spring-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, the issue of expanding NATO into Central and Eastern European states was not on the agenda at that time, since all of them were [[Warsaw Pact]] members and most still had substantial Soviet combat units stationed on their soil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Pifer|authorlink=Steven Pifer|url=https://www.brookings.edu/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/|title=Did NATO Promise Not to Enlarge? Gorbachev Says "No"|publisher=Brookings Institution|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jackmatlock.com/2014/04/nato-expansion-was-there-a-promise/|title=NATO EXPANSION: WAS THERE A PROMISE?|website=JackMatlock.com|date=3 April 2014|author=Jack Matlock|authorlink=Jack F. Matlock Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gorbachev "did not even contemplate seeking a provision that would bar any other Warsaw Pact countries from eventually pursuing membership in NATO".&lt;ref name=TWQ/&gt; This was rebuked by the [[National Security Archive]] in December 2017, which had looked in the declassified record:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Svetlana Savranskaya|author2=Tom Blanton|title=NATO Expansion: What Gorbachev Heard|url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2017-12-12/nato-expansion-what-gorbachev-heard-western-leaders-early|work=[[National Security Archive]]|language=en|date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The documents show that multiple national leaders were considering and rejecting Central and Eastern European membership in NATO as of early 1990 and through 1991, that discussions of NATO in the context of German unification negotiations in 1990 were not at all narrowly limited to the status of East German territory, and that subsequent Soviet and Russian complaints about being misled about NATO expansion were founded in written contemporaneous memcons and telcons at the highest levels. }}

The invocation of the supposed non-expansion pledge to justify Russia's [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] has been criticized by NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=NATO|authorlink1=NATO|title=Russia’s accusations - setting the record straight, Fact Sheet - April 2014|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_109141.htm|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=NATO Review|author=Michael Rühle|title=NATO enlargement and Russia: myths and realities|date=2014|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2014/russia-ukraine-nato-crisis/nato-enlargement-russia/en/index.htm|publisher=[[NATO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Absent from the Treaty ==
The two-plus-four-treaty had the function of a peace treaty, but it was not called a peace treaty. This could not be in their interest "for financial reasons", according to the German State Secretary Friedrich Voss at that time. The reason was the open question of [[German reparations for World War II]], especially in the [[German reparations for World War II#Greece|case of Greece]]. Today Berlin argues that the Greeks should have made their demands in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/vorab/kohl-trickste-1990-um-reparationen-an-griechenland-zu-vermeiden-a-1019586.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== XOXO 2012 ===

The inaugural event was held in Portland's [[Yale Union Laundry Building]] in September 2012 with approximately 400 participants.&lt;ref name="verge-dream"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/19/3359592/xoxo-festival-2012-internet-party-conference|title=The Dream of the Internet is Alive in Portland: Inside the XOXO Festival|last=Gantz|first=Ryan|work=The Verge|date=September 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first day of the conference focused on talks from independent creators from fields such as film, comics, music, art and illustration, video games, hardware design and product design, while the second centered on technology, and those building tools to facilitate and encourage independent creativity through the web. Speakers and performers included [[Dan Harmon]], [[Adam Savage]], [[MC Frontalot]], [[Christopher Poole|Chris Poole]], [[Bre Pettis]], [[Julia Nunes]], [[The Kleptones]], [[The Limousines]], and the creators of [[Kickstarter]], [[MetaFilter]], [[VHX]], [[Simple (bank)|Simple]], ''[[Diesel Sweeties]]'', ''[[Indie Game: The Movie]]'' and ''[[World of Goo]]''.

Associated events included live music, film screenings, an arcade of independently produced videogames, a pub crawl, a market, and food trucks.&lt;ref name="nyt-festival"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/xoxo-a-festival-of-indie-internet-creativity/|work=New York Times Bits Blog|title=XOXO: A Festival of Indie Internet Creativity|first1=Jenna|last1=Wortham|last2=Gallagher|first2=David F.|date=September 18, 2012 |accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News media and bloggers noted an "impressive list of speakers",&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; a focus on "democratizing media and innovation",&lt;ref name="xoxo-tate"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/business/2012/09/xoxo-counterculture/|title=At XOXO, a Counterculture Kickstarts Itself|work=Wired|last=Tate|first=Ryan|date=September 18, 2012 |accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an "intimate tone" missing from other technology-focused conferences.&lt;ref name="verge-dream"/&gt; Ruth Brown wrote "the audience was overwhelmingly white, male, middle class and educated."&lt;ref name="PGB"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-29204-reflections_on_the_x.html | title = Reflections on the XOXO Festival | author = Ruth Brown | date = 2012-09-18 | accessdate = 2014-09-28 | work = [[Willamette Week]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== XOXO 2013 ===

[[File:Andy Baio and Andy McMillan Toast XOXO 2013.jpg|thumb|Andy Baio and Andy McMillan on stage at the end of XOXO 2013]]

XOXO returned to the [[Yale Union Laundry Building]] in September 2013 with speakers, workshops, films, music shows, game events, and a market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/09/technology_creativity_cross_at.html |work= The Oregonian |title= Technology, creativity cross at XOXO |first1= Luke |last1= Larsen |date= September 20, 2013 |accessdate= November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baio described it as being "about artists and hackers and makers that are using the internet to make a living doing what they love independently without sacrificing creative or financial control".&lt;ref name="wired-2013"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/09/xoxo-2013/ |work= Wired |title= The Record-Breaking XOXO Festival Returns to Cross-Pollinate Art and Tech |first1= Rachel |last1= Edidin |date= September 20, 2013 |accessdate= November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Portland Monthly]]'' compared the event to the larger [[South by Southwest]] festival, quoting [[Matthew Haughey]] saying SXSW speakers are "in the business of selling technologies" and XOXO speakers are "creating things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/arts-and-entertainment/articles/how-the-xoxo-festival-charms-cutting-edge-thinkers-september-2013 |work= Portland Monthly |title= How the XOXO Festival Charms Cutting-Edge Thinkers |first1= Marty |last1= Patall |date= September 3, 2013 |accessdate= November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To handle increased interest while remaining small (500 conference tickets and 200 "fringe event" tickets), it had an application process with questions intended to filter out people who wanted to market to attendees.&lt;ref name="wired-2013"/&gt;

Speakers and performers included [[Tim Schafer]], [[Vi Hart]], [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]], [[Molly Crabapple]], [[Marco Arment]], [[Jack Conte]], [[Erika Moen]], [[Jay Smooth]], [[Adrian Holovaty]], and the creators of [[Cards Against Humanity]], [[Pinboard (website)|Pinboard]], and [[Panic (company)|Panic]]. The editors of [[Boing Boing]]—[[Mark Frauenfelder]], [[Cory Doctorow]], [[David Pescovitz]], and [[Xeni Jardin]]—appeared together on stage for the first time to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the [[zine]]'s launch in 1988. Musical performances included [[Anamanaguchi]], [[Jack Conte]], [[Jonathan Coulton]], and [[Jim Guthrie (singer-songwriter)|Jim Guthrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Announcing XOXO Music|url = http://blog.xoxofest.com/post/58255108449/announcing-xoxo-music|date = August 14, 2013|accessdate = March 25, 2015|website = XOXOFest Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attendee, Glenn Fleishman, described the conference as having a very friendly social environment and inspiring people to change their jobs, and he noted essays by other attendees about the need for critique and not just friendliness, a lack of gender balance similar to the technology industry in general, and a harassment incident that was handled effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://boingboing.net/2013/09/30/in-a-time-of-hugs-and-kisses.html |title = In a Time of Hugs and Kisses: XOXO 2013 |date = September 30, 2013 |first1= Glenn |last1= Fleishman |work = BoingBoing |accessdate = November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another attendee also discussed her enjoyment of the people at the conference, and she noted the challenge of running a conference about independent creators that is inaccessible for some independent creators due to ticket and travel cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/09/trickle-down-innovation-collateral-cost-of-indie-independence/ |work=Wired |title=XOXO and the High Costs of Not Selling Out |first1=Rachel |last1=Edidin |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026164616/http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/09/trickle-down-innovation-collateral-cost-of-indie-independence |archivedate=October 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizers described their choice of [[Yale Union Laundry Building]] as important to the event, with character and history unlike [[Oregon Convention Center|Portland's convention center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/arts-and-entertainment/culturephile-portland-arts/articles/xoxo-2013-andy-baio-tells-us-what-the-fest-is-not-september-2013 |work= Portland Monthly |title= XOXO 2013: Why This Fest is Different |first1= Marty |last1= Patall |date= September 20, 2013 |accessdate= November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== XOXO 2014 ===

[[File:XOXO Festival 2014.jpg|thumb|XOXO 2014 inside The Redd]]

In 2014, the third XOXO was held on September 11–14, 2014 at The Redd, a former metal stamping facility in an industrial area of SE Portland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

A new evening event, XOXO Story, was added in 2014 with live performances of popular podcasts like [[Harmontown]], [[John Roderick (musician)|John Roderick]]'s Rendezvous, and [[Song Exploder]] featuring an interview with [[The Thermals]]. A second night of music was also added, including performances from [[Pomplamoose]], [[YACHT (band)|YACHT]], [[Molly Lewis]], [[John Roderick (musician)|John Roderick]] and [[Sean Nelson]] from [[The Long Winters]], [[Mike Doughty]], and [[Nerf Herder]]. XOXO Arcade featured 10 unreleased or exhibition-only games, such as [[Quadrilateral Cowboy]] and the ten-player [[Killer Queen (video game)|Killer Queen]] arcade cabinet, and new work from [[Keita Takahashi]], [[Threes (game)|Threes]] creator [[Asher Vollmer]], and [[QWOP]] creator [[Bennett Foddy]].

News media and bloggers noted a more serious tone from previous years. [[Boing Boing]] said a "darker sense of mission and meaning took hold in the event's third year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/09/22/the-lottery-at-xoxo-2014.html|title=The narrative lottery at XOXO|date=22 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Verge]] called it "the most interesting weekend in tech" that "pushes the web forward."&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt; [[The Daily Dot]] reported that 40% of attendees were female, double the rate of previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/death-failure-xoxo-2014/|title=Thinkers, makers, and dreamers anonymous|date=18 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== XOXO 2015 ===

The fourth XOXO was held on September 10–13, 2015 at [[Revolution Hall]], the auditorium of the former [[Washington High School (Portland, Oregon)|Washington High School]] in the Buckman neighborhood of SE Portland. For the first time, a limited number of subsidized passes were offered for $50 to those who couldn't otherwise afford to attend. Free on-site childcare, live captioning of talks, and free bike rentals were also new additions.

Conference speakers included [[Heather Armstrong]], [[Gimlet Media]]'s [[Alex Blumberg]], [[Veronica Belmont]], [[Kathy Sierra]], [[Spike Trotman]], [[Daniel Mallory Ortberg]], [[Anil Dash]], [[Zoë Quinn]], [[Eric A. Meyer]], [[BoJack Horseman]]'s Lisa Hanawalt, [[Vlambeer]]'s Rami Ismail, and the creators of [[Suck.com]], reuniting on stage for the webzine's 20th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2015.xoxofest.com/conference|title=XOXO|website=2015.xoxofest.com|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XOXO Music was held on an outdoor stage for the first time, with evening musical performances by [[Dan Deacon]], [[Kaki King]], [[Vulfpeck]], [[Open Mike Eagle]], [[NIKO IS]], Kawehi, and the first live CVS Bangers by [[Hennessy Youngman]]. During the day, music performances were curated by [[Patreon]]'s [[Jack Conte]] and [[Ground Kontrol]]'s Art Santana.

Seven films and shorts were shown at XOXO Film &amp; Animation with Q&amp;A from the creators, including new work from Every Frame A Painting's Tony Zhou, Everything Is A Remix's Kirby Ferguson, Feminist Frequency's [[Anita Sarkeesian]], and animator [[Justin Roiland]] screened [[House of Cosbys]] and debuted a new episode of [[Rick and Morty]]. XOXO Story, an evening event focused on live podcasts and storytelling, featured live performances from [[Gimlet Media]]'s Reply All, Hello from the Magic Tavern, the founders of [[Suck.com]], and You Look Nice Today with [[Merlin Mann]], [[Adam Lisagor]], and Scott Simpson, followed by the unannounced premiere of [[Adam Lisagor]]'s Computer Show.

XOXO Tabletop brought the creators of eight independently-produced tabletop games to show their work, including The Metagame, Two Rooms and a Boom, Bycatch, Funemployed, and Marrying Mr. Darcy.

Engadget wrote many talks were "emotionally driven... centered around the difficult issues of being independent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Nicole|title=How an independent art and technology festival captured my heart|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/19/xoxofest-2015/|website=Engadget|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guardian attributed the festival's popularity to "its gentleness, its emotive undertone and thoughtful curation, but also its commitment to supporting individual artists over businesses and corporates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kiss|first1=Jemima|title=Makerbase and the mission to dispel tech's 'founders' myths|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/28/makerbase-and-the-mission-to-dispel-techs-founders-myths|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Verge wrote that [[Slack (software)|Slack]] "broke out at Portland's XOXO Festival" when attendees used the chat software in the weeks leading up the festival to socialize and coordinate activities, creating over 150 channels covering a variety of interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=Casey|title=Why Slack could be the future of conferences|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/18/9349425/slack-future-of-conferences-xoxo-festival|website=The Verge|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== XOXO 2016 ===

For the fifth XOXO, held September 8—11, 2016, the festival returned to [[Revolution Hall]] in SE Portland, with over 1,200 attendees. Expanding the amenities from the previous year, 10% of passes were offered to low-income attendees for free, reduced from $50 the previous year. Free on-site childcare included a new childrens' arcade with a rotating lineup of independent videogames, and children were allowed to attend the festival for free.
