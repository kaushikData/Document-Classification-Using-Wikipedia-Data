{{Accounting}}
An '''accounting period''' is a period with reference to which [[United Kingdom corporation tax]] is charged.&lt;ref&gt;Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; It helps dictate when tax is paid on income and gains. An accounting period begins whenever a company comes within the corporation tax charge, and whenever an accounting period ends without the company ceasing to be within the charge.
There are a number of rules about when an accounting period ends, and we look at each of these below. 

Often an accounting period coincides with a company's ''period of account''. This is the period for which it draws up [[financial statements|accounts]],&lt;ref&gt;Section 832(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; except for a life assurance company, where it is the period for which it draws up its periodical return.&lt;ref&gt;Section 431 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; However, periods of account and accounting periods do not necessarily coincide.

==Basic rules==

An accounting period begins when:&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

*the company comes within the charge to corporation tax. A company usually first comes within the corporation tax charge when it first acquires a source of income.&lt;ref&gt;Section 832(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (see the closing words) and HM Revenue and Customs' ''Company Taxation Manual'' at [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM01410.htm CTM01410]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it will also come within the charge if it commences business but is not already within the charge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Section 12(4) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Overseas companies usually come within the charge if they become UK resident or start trading in the UK through a UK [[permanent establishment]];&lt;ref&gt;Section 11 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It was also held in ''Walker v Centaur Clothes Group Ltd'' 72 TC 379 that a source is not always necessary. In that case, it was held that the company becoming liable to pay advance corporation tax was enough to bring it within the charge to tax.&lt;/ref&gt;
*an accounting period of the company ends, and the company is still within the charge to corporation tax; or
*the company does not currently have an accounting period and has a chargeable gain or allowable loss.&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(6) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Chargeable gains and allowable losses are taxable gains and tax relievable losses that arise on the disposal of certain capital assets, for example on the disposal of the company's head office.&lt;ref&gt;The full definition of what constitutes a chargeable gain or allowable loss is in the ''Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992''&lt;/ref&gt;

An accounting period ends on the earliest of the following:&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(3) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

*the expiration of 12 months from the beginning of the accounting period;
*an accounting date of the company or, if there is a period for which the company does not draw up accounts, the end of that period;
*the company beginning or ceasing to trade or to be, in respect of the trade or (if more than one) of all trades carried on by it, within the charge to corporation tax;
*the company beginning or ceasing to be UK resident;
*the company ceasing to be within the charge to corporation tax.

There are further rules to deal with windings up, life assurance companies and lessor companies.

A UK-resident company is treated as coming within the charge to corporation tax (if it has not already come within the charge to corporation tax) when it commences to carry on business.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Example==

Suppose ABC Ltd, a UK resident company is incorporated on 1 August 20X1. It acquires a source of income (an interest-bearing bank account) on 1 September 20X1 and commences trading on 1 October 20X1 and continues trading throughout all other periods under review. It draws up its accounts for the following periods:

:1 August 20X1 to 31 December 20X1
:1 January 20X2 to 31 December 20X2
:1 January 20X3 to 30 June 20X3
:1 July 20X3 to 31 December 20X4

Then ABC Ltd would have the following accounting periods:

:1 September 20X1 to 30 September 20X1 (from when it came into charge to corporation tax to the commencement of trade)
:1 October 20X1 to 31 December 20X1 (to the end of a period of account)
:1 January 20X2 to 31 December 20X2 (to the end of a period of account)
:1 January 20X3 to 30 June 20X3 (to the end of a period of account)
:1 July 20X3 to 30 June 20X4 (to the expiry of 12 months)
:1 July 20X4 to 31 December 20X4 (to the end of a period of account)

==Company with more than one trade==

If a company carrying on more than one trade draws up accounts of any of them to different dates, and does not make up general accounts for the whole of the company's activities, the company may determine that any one of those dates shall be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining whether an accounting period has ended under the rule in the second bullet point above.&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(5) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

If, however, the Board of [[HMRC]] is of the opinion, on reasonable grounds, that the date so chosen by the company is inappropriate, they may, if it is reasonable to do so, give notice that the accounting date of another of the company's trades should be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(5A) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mean accounting date==

Some companies draw up financial statements to the same day of the week, a Sunday, say, each year. They will therefore have 364-day (52-week) or 371-day (53-week) periods of account. As long as the company draws its accounts up to within four days of a mean accounting date each year, it may, for the purposes of determining its accounting periods, deem its accounts to be drawn up for a twelve-month period. For example, when there is a 371-day period of account, instead of having one accounting period of 365 days (in a non-leap year) and another of 6 days, it will prepare its return on the assumption that the period of account was 365 days long.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''[[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]]'s'' Technical Release 500 and [[HM Revenue and Customs]]' ''Company Taxation Manual'' at [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM01560.htm CTM01560].&lt;/ref&gt;

This method is related to the [[4-4-5 Calendar]] of accounts, where a quarter is deemed to comprise two months of 4 weeks each and one month of 5 weeks, a total of 13 weeks or 91 days.  In the [[United States]] the method is referred to as the 52-53 Week Fiscal Year and is approved for use under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the [[Internal Revenue Code]].  See article under [[4-4-5 Calendar]] for discussion of the US method application.

==Inspector determining the accounting period==

Where it appears to the tax inspector that the beginning or end of any accounting period is uncertain, he may make an assessment on the company for such period, not exceeding 12 months, as appears to him appropriate. In that event, that period is treated for all purposes as an accounting period unless the inspector sees fit to revise it as a result of receiving further facts, or on an appeal against the assessment in respect of some other matter the company shows the true accounting periods. If on an appeal against an assessment made under this rule the company shows the true accounting periods, the assessment appealed against has effect as an assessment or assessments for the true accounting periods, and assessments may be made for any such periods as might have been made at the time when the assessment appealed against was made.&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(8) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration and winding up==

===Administration===

An accounting period ends immediately before the day a company enters into [[administration (insolvency)|administration]]. For this purpose a company enters administration when it enters administration under Schedule B1 to the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] or is subject to any corresponding procedure otherwise than under that Act (for example, in an overseas jurisdiction).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Section 12(7ZA) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; 

An accounting period ends when a company ceases to be in administration.&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(3)(da) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; For these purposes a company ceases to be in administration when it ceases to be in administration under Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 or any corresponding event occurs otherwise than under that Act&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(5B) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, in an overseas jurisdiction).

===Winding up===

An accounting period ends and a new one begins with the commencement of a [[winding up]]. For this purpose a winding up is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the winding up of the company, or on the presentation of a winding up petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a winding up order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose in the case of a winding up otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Section 12(7) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, an accounting period does not end other than by the expiration of 12 months from its beginning or by the completion of the winding up.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; However, if the company later enters administration, this rule is disapplied from that point (and with an accounting period ending because the company has entered into administration).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

During the course of a winding up, a company may make an estimate of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. If the date assumed for the winding up turns out to be before the actual winding up, then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for the winding up, a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as if the winding up had started with that accounting period.&lt;ref&gt;Section 342(6) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperatives preparing quarterly and half-yearly accounts==

HMRC will, under certain conditions, allow [[cooperative]]s that prepare quarterly and half-yearly accounts to merge a number of periods of account for tax purposes so that they have only accounting date each year.&lt;ref&gt;Inland Revenue ''Extra-statutory concession C12'' See page 67 of [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/specialist/esc.pdf this pdf] from HM Revenue and Customs (772k)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life assurance companies==

Additionally, there are special rules that apply to [[life assurance]] companies from which life assurance business is transferred under an insurance business transfer scheme. Different rules apply depending on whether section 444AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 applies. For transfers before 1 January 2007, s444AA applies where the whole of the transferor's long-term insurance business is being transferred and the company. It is proposed that the Finance Bill 2007 will amend this for transfers on or after 1 January, so that section 444AA applies where the whole or substantially the whole of the transferor's long-term insurance business is transferred, in which case the transfer time is taken to be the time some business is first transferred/&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2006/index.htm See draft legislation released by HMRC on 6 December 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230091149/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2006/index.htm |date=December 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If section 444AA does not apply, an accounting period of the transferor company ends with the day of the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(7A) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

If section 444AA applies, an accounting period of the transferor company ends immediately before the transfer, and the transferor also has an accounting period covering the instant of the transfer (except for the purposes of calculating the equalisation provision for tax purposes).&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(7C) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example where s444AA applies===

Suppose a transferor company, XYZ Life Ltd, has in the past prepared periodical returns for a period encompassing the calendar year. It transfers the whole of its business at 11.59pm on 31 December 20X1, after which it retains some cash on deposit. It agrees with the [[Financial Services Authority]] that it does not need to prepare a periodical return for 20X1.

XYZ Life Ltd will have the following accounting periods in 20X1:

:1 January 20X1 to immediately before the transfer of business
:An accounting period covering the instant of the transfer (11.59pm on 31 December 20X1)
:An accounting period covering the period beginning immediately after the transfer to midnight on 31 December 20X1

==Lessor companies==

If a company carries on a business of [[leasing]] plant or machinery, is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the business and there is a qualifying change of ownership in relation to the company, then an accounting period of the company ends on the day of that qualifying change in ownership, and a new accounting period begins on the following day. There are exceptions to this in Paragraph 40.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraphs 3, 33, 40 Schedule 10 to the [[Finance Act]] 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial deeming provisions==

Other provisions in the [[Taxes Acts]] sometimes deem there to be accounting periods for specific purposes only. This is typically on the introduction of new legislation. For example, when section 75 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 was replaced as a result of the Finance Act 2004, companies, if necessary, deemed themselves to have an accounting period ending on 31 March 2004 for the purposes of calculating management expenses that they were entitled to under the rules applying pre-1 April 2004 and post-31 March 2004.

'''Alessio Emmanuel "Alex" Vella''' (born 5 June 1953), or '''Maltese Falcon''', is a Maltese businessman, former boxer, stand over man and the former National President of the [[Rebels Motorcycle Club]] in Australia. Despite having lived in Australia since the 1960s, he is not a citizen of the country.&lt;ref name=abc-no-appeal /&gt; This caused [[Visa (document)|visa]] problems when he tried to return to Australia after having gone to Japan with his son [[Adam Vella (boxer)|Adam]] (also a boxer) for a boxing match in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwildcats.net/yabb/YaBB.pl?num=1174517431 |title=Rebels boss stranded in Japan |publisher=Ldcats.net |date= |accessdate=10 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008122945/http://wwwildcats.net/yabb/YaBB.pl?num=1174517431 |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/bikie-leader-stranded-in-japan/2007/03/22/1174153218161.html |title=Bikie leader stranded in Japan |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=22 March 2007 |agency=AAP|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New South Wales Police Force]] tried to bar Vella from re-entering Australia then, but he was eventually allowed to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dylan |last=Welch |date=4 April 2007  |work=Sydney Morning Herald |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/bikie-gang-rebel-allowed-back-in/2007/04/04/1175366279726.html?page=1 |title=Bikie gang rebel back  |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Vella visited his friends in family in Malta, and while he was there, his residency visa was cancelled by the Australian [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection]]. Vella tried to appeal in the High Court in October 2015, but was not permitted to.

== Private life ==
Vella was born into a strict [[Catholicism|Catholic]] family in [[Malta]] and was one of eleven children. His parents lived in a small villa near Buskett. He began work at the age of eight, carrying buckets of water on a building site for 30 cents a day, and is functionally illiterate. He and his family then moved to Australia in the 1960s and established a strawberry farm near [[Horsley Park, New South Wales]]. In his 20s, he sometimes worked two or three jobs at a time; as a [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], [[labourer]] and [[bricklayer]]. He also joined the Rebels Motorcycle Club while pursuing a promising career as a [[Boxing|boxer]]; he eventually became the Maltese light-heavyweight champion. After a serious road accident, he received {{AUD|link=yes|225,000}} in compensation and used this money to set up a business importing and selling motorcycles.

== Legal issues ==
In 1990, police found a $15,000 stash of [[marijuana]] while searching his home, which they believed to be a [[methamphetamine]] factory. He received a fairly light sentence: 18-months of two-nights-a-week prison, and two-days-a-week community service. He has also been arrested, but not convicted, of a number of other crimes including stabbing two men and assaulting a woman. He was freed on appeal after being given six months in jail for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hills |first=Ben |url=http://benhills.com/articles/scams-scoundrels/the-millionaire-bikie/ |title=Alex Vella, the millionaire bikie |publisher=Benhills.com |date= |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2008, Vella won a court case against the [[ANZ Bank]]. He sued them for $2.7&amp;nbsp;million after his former business partner, Tony Caradonna, re-mortgaged three properties, including the Rebels' clubhouse, for $2.4&amp;nbsp;million by falsifying Vella's signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theage.com.au/business/bikie-boss-wins-24m-fraud-case-20080528-2iv1.html |title=Bikie boss wins $2.4m fraud case | newspaper=The Age |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=21 May 2018 |agency=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed $300,000 was fraudulently withdrawn from their joint bank account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/05/28/2257868.htm?site=sydney |title=Head of the Rebels bikie gang wins multi-million-dollar lawsuit against ANZ Bank |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2014, Immigration Minister [[Scott Morrison]] cancelled Vella's residency visa on character grounds while Vella was visiting Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/minister-revokes-rebels-bikie-boss-alex-vellas-visa-while-overseas/story-fni0fiyv-1226956327257 |title=Minister revokes Rebels bikie boss Alex Vella's visa while overseas |publisher=heraldsun.com.au |date=16 June 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-06-17/rebel-bikie-gang-leaders-visa-cancelled/5528744|title=Government cancels Rebel bikie gang leader Alex Vella's visa|publisher=ABC (Australia) |date=17 June 2014|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vella attempted to challenge the action in the [[High Court of Australia]],&lt;ref name=abc-last-ditch&gt;{{cite news |last1=Willacy|first1=Mark |author-link=Mark Willacy |title=Rebels boss Alex Vella, stranded in Malta, launches last-ditch bid to return to Australia |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-16/exiled-rebels-boss-in-last-ditch-bid-to-return-to-australia/6854902 |accessdate=17 October 2015 |work=ABC News |publisher=ABC (Australia) |date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 16 October 2015 the court refused his application for [[leave to appeal]].&lt;ref name=abc-no-appeal&gt;{{cite news |title=Rebels Motorcycle Club boss Alex Vella loses bid to return to Australia |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-16/rebels-motorcycle-club-boss-alex-vella-loses-appeal/6860170 |accessdate=17 October 2015 |work=ABC News |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bread crumbs''' or '''breadcrumbs''' (regional variants: breading, crispies) are sliced residue of dry [[bread]], used for breading or crumbing foods, topping [[casserole]]s, [[stuffing]] [[poultry]], [[thickening]] [[stew]]s, adding inexpensive bulk to [[soups]], [[meatloaf|meatloaves]] and similar foods, and making a crisp and crunchy covering for fried foods, especially [[breaded cutlet]]s like [[tonkatsu]] and [[schnitzel]].  The [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] variety of bread crumbs is called ''panko''.

==Types==

===Dry breadcrumbs===
Dry breadcrumbs are made from dry breads which have been baked or toasted to remove most remaining moisture, and may have a sandy or even powdery texture.  Bread crumbs are most easily produced by pulverizing slices of bread in a [[food processor]], using a steel blade to make coarse crumbs, or a grating blade to make fine crumbs. A [[grater]] or similar tool will also do.

===Fresh breadcrumbs===
The breads used to make soft or fresh bread crumbs are not quite as dry, so the crumbs are larger and produce a softer coating, crust, or stuffing. The ''crumb'' of ''bread crumb'' also refers to the texture of the soft, inner part of a bread loaf, as distinguished from the crust, or "skin".

=== Panko ===
[[File:Baked panko crusted pork with pineapple sauce over udon.jpg|left|thumb|Baked ''panko'' crusted [[pork]] with [[pineapple]] sauce over [[udon]]]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Panko'''''|パン粉}} is a variety of flaky bread crumb used in [[Japanese cuisine]] as a crunchy coating for [[frying|fried]] foods, such as ''[[tonkatsu]]''. ''Panko'' is made from bread baked by electrical current, which yields a bread without a crust, and then grinding the bread to create fine slivers of crumb.&lt;ref name="UpperCrust"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNU9TrbiRk |title=Panko Bread Crumbs: The Secrets Revealed |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in [[European cuisine|Western cuisine]] and resists absorbing oil or grease when fried, resulting in a lighter coating.  Outside [[Japan]], its use is becoming more popular in both Asian and non-Asian dishes: It is often used on seafood and is often available in [[Asian supermarket|Asian markets]], speciality stores, and, increasingly, in many large [[supermarket]]s.

''Panko'' is produced worldwide, particularly in Asian countries, including Japan, [[Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], and [[Vietnam]].



==== Etymology ====

The Japanese first learned to make bread from the Europeans. The word ''panko'' is derived from ''pan'', the Portuguese/Spanish/Japanese word for bread, and ''-ko'', a Japanese suffix indicating "[[flour]]", "coating", "crumb", or "powder" (as in ''komeko'', "rice powder", ''sobako'', "[[buckwheat]] flour", and ''komugiko'', "[[wheat]] flour").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marshall |first=Jo |url=http://www.heraldnews.com/lifestyle/food/x2084588983/COOKCABULARY-Panko-is-a-crumby-ingredient |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122002748/http://www.heraldnews.com/lifestyle/food/x2084588983/COOKCABULARY-Panko-is-a-crumby-ingredient |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-11-22 |title=COOKCABULARY: Panko is a crumby ingredient - Fall River, MA |publisher=The Herald News |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2012-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breading==
[[File:Breading.jpg|thumb|Cornmeal breading]]
'''Breading''' (also known as '''crumbing''') is a dry [[grain]]-derived [[food coating]] for a piece of food made from bread crumbs or a breading mixture with seasonings. Breading can also refer to the process of applying a bread-like coating to a food. Breading is well suited for [[frying]] as it lends itself to creating a crisp coating around the food. Breading mixtures can be made of breadcrumb, [[flour]], [[cornmeal]], and [[seasoning]] that the item to be breaded is dredged in before cooking. If the item to be breaded is too dry for the coating to stick, the item may first be moistened with [[buttermilk]], raw [[egg (food)|egg]], [[egg wash]] or other liquid.

Breading contrasts with [[batter (cooking)|batter]], which is a grain-based liquid coating for food that produces a smoother and finer texture, but which can be softer overall.

==In popular culture==
In the fairy tale [[Hansel and Gretel]], breadcrumbs were used by Hansel and Gretel to track their footpath. However, the bread crumbs were eventually eaten by birds, subsequently leading them to become lost in the woods. The popularity of breadcrumbs in the fairy tale lead to the inspiration the name "[[Breadcrumb (navigation)|breadcrumb]]" as a navigation element that allows users to keep track of their locations within programs or documents.&lt;ref name="Mark Levene"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Search Engines and Web Navigation|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0470526842|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=mDI72_9-bw0C&amp;pg=PA221|author=Mark Levene|edition=2nd|page=221|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruce Fairchild Barton''' (August 5, 1886 – July 5, 1967) was an American author, advertising executive, and politician.

==Biography==
Born in [[Robbins, Tennessee]] in 1886, Barton was the son of a Congregational clergyman and grew up in various places throughout the U.S., including the metro [[Chicago]] area. Barton was raised in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] (located only ten miles away by railroads from Chicago).

Bruce Barton's father, William E. Barton, was a prolific writer and a devout Christian pastor serving the First Congregational Church for over 20 years. Barton's mother, Esther Treat Bushnell, was an elementary school teacher who was descended from a number of colonial Connecticut leaders including Francis Bushnell, [[Robert Treat]], and [[John Davenport (minister)|John Davenport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/org.oclc.lac.ui.DialABookServlet?oclcnum=60189616|title=Find in a library: The man everybody knew: Bruce Barton and the making of modern America|last=|first=|date=|website=www.worldcat.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton's siblings were Charles William Barton (b. 1887), Helen (b. 1889), Robert Shawmut Barton (b. 1894).&lt;ref&gt;"The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America", Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barton's parents also took in a young abandoned mulatto boy to care for in the Barton household by the name of Webster Betty, as they also did for Rebecca, a young African-American girl whose mother asked Barton's parents to take care of her.&lt;ref&gt;"The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America", Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalism appealed to Barton even as a child and he sold newspapers in his free time when he was only nine. Later on during his teenage years, he served as the editor for his high school newspaper, and became a reporter for a local newspaper called the Oak Park Weekly. Barton also helped run his uncle's maple syrup business, which became successful due to his contributions.

Barton first enrolled in [[Berea College]] (where his father attended college) during 1903 and later transferred to [[Amherst College]] in Massachusetts,&lt;ref name="anb.org"&gt;Dennis Wepman. [http://www.anb.org/articles/10/10-00105.html "Barton, Bruce Fairchild"], American National Biography Online, February 2000. Retrieved November 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; where he graduated in 1907.

===Ad Man===
Barton worked as a [[publicist]] and magazine editor before co-founding the Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn (BDO) [[advertising agency]] in 1919. Nine years later the agency merged with the [[George Batten (advertiser)|George Batten]] agency to become Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn ([[BBDO]]). Barton replaced Roy S. Durstein as president of BBDO during 1939 and then headed the BBDO agency until 1961, all while helping his business partners and employees toward establishing Madison Avenue in New York City as the Mecca for the advertising industry, advancing institutional advertising for American corporations, and developing BBDO into one of the major creative advertising firms operating in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America", Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other famous BBDO campaigns, Barton created the character of [[Betty Crocker]].&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited with naming [[General Motors]] and [[General Electric]] (and creating an early design of the circular GE corporate logo and catch phrase). Barton was also a member of the [[Peabody Award]]s [[The George Foster Peabody Awards Board of Jurors|Board of Jurors]] from 1940 to 1942.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/george-foster-peabody-awards-board-members&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republican politician===
Initially supporting progressive political policies as a young man, Barton later became an active supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in 1919, and he later served as an advisor for both the Republican Party and several Republican presidential candidates from the time of [[Calvin Coolidge]] during the 1920s to that of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="thefamouspeople.com"&gt;http://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/bruce-fairchild-barton-934.php#ZPvhrt1Rbsfm1g6h.99 "Barton Fairchild Barton Biography".&lt;/ref&gt;  As a staunch opponent of U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]], Barton offered his public relations services to many Republican candidates over the years. Barton won a special election to fill the unexpired term of Democrat [[Theodore A. Peyser|U.S. Rep. Theodore A. Peyser]], who died on August 8, 1937, within the U.S. House of Representatives.  Barton eventually served two terms (1937–1941) within the U.S. House, representing the Manhattan house district and he later ran an unsuccessful [[New York state election, 1940|1940]] campaign for election as [[U.S. Senator from New York]].

===Writer===
As the author of many bestselling guidebooks, Barton also wrote literally hundreds of popular magazines articles and syndicated newspaper columns, offering his readers advice and inspiration for attaining Barton's own idealization of the [[American Dream]], based largely upon Barton's meshing of his own life as a "small town boy" and sectarian Christian beliefs in with his admiration of certain American business and industry leaders  ("Service").

====''The Man Nobody Knows'' - Christian apologetics for wealthy businessmen====
Barton had projected many Christian Biblical themes throughout his works completed within his varied writing career, due in part to his own strong religious convictions.&lt;ref name="anb.org"/&gt; One historian writes: "Barton believed incurably in material progress, in self-improvement, in individualism, and in the Judeo-Christian ethic, and none of the profound crises through which his generation lived appreciably changed the tenor of his writings or their capacity to reflect what masses of Americans, optimists in the progressive tradition, apparently continued to want to hear."

Barton's most famous book was, ''[[The Man Nobody Knows]]'' (1925), a "[[Boosterism|boosterish]] melding of religion with business" that coupled with "new communication and advertising media", provided the "cultural shift that encouraged the public display of spiritual allegiances that once belonged to the realm of private life", while amplifying the widely perceived public adoration of American business during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism", 2004. pp. 252-254. Susan Jacoby, Metropolitan Books. {{ISBN|0-8050-7442-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Barton envisions Jesus as if he were alive as a [[Masculinity|man's man]] in the present day of the 1920s while criticizing the overly meek Jesus that people were used to during that time. Barton also depicts Jesus as a "strong magnetic" executive businessman, similar to himself.

In the 1925 edition of ''The Man Nobody Knows'' Barton incorporated controversial chapter titles leading into the exploration of Barton's Jesus-as-businessman themes, such as calling Jesus a modern "Executive", postulating that Jesus communicated effectively by "His Advertisements", and hailing Jesus as "The Founder of Modern Business" among others.&lt;ref&gt;"The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America", Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. pp.91-93.&lt;/ref&gt; In the much later 1956 edition of ''The Man Nobody Knows'', editors at Bobbs-Merrill "heavily amended" Barton's text with his permission, cutting out the references to business and advertising. along with excerpts featuring popular celebrities of the 1920s, such as [[Henry Ford]], [[George Walbridge Perkins|George Perkins]], and Jim Jeffries.&lt;ref&gt;"The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America", Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. p.112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later 1926 book, ''The Book Nobody Knows'', Barton provides readers with his revamped image of the Christian Holy Bible.&lt;ref name="thefamouspeople.com"/&gt;

===Sexual affair with BBDO employee===
Public attention was called to a sexual affair that Barton was secretly having from 1928 to 1932 with BBDO employee Frances Wagner King. King had originally presented herself to Barton and others at BBDO as an unmarried woman. Her husband later threatened to sue Barton for alienation of affection. Barton paid the Kings $25,000 in hush money.

Later, during a 1932 appointment with her attorney, Mrs. King informed Barton that she was suing him for slander and seeking damages of $250,000 based on an unfavorable work reference he had provided to a potential employer of King.&lt;ref name="The Man Everybody Knew 2005. pp. 139-141"&gt;"The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America", Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. pp. 139-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. King also informed Barton she was working on a novel about an advertising man based loosely on Barton's own private and public life, but that she would not publish her work and would drop her slander lawsuit if Barton would settle the matter with a payment of $50,000 to King.

The newspapers reported about the Barton and King sexual affair (and other similar King allegations of impropriety by Barton) after learning of Barton's arrest under a civil order from Mrs. King's slander suit.&lt;ref name="The Man Everybody Knew 2005. pp. 139-141" /&gt;

Barton filed a blackmail criminal charge against Mrs. King on April 17, 1933, and her criminal trial ran from July 18 to August 2, 1933. On August 2, 1933, a jury found Frances Wagner King guilty of blackmail. After her serving two years of her original sentence, an appeal court reduced Mrs. King's sentence to three to six years.&lt;ref name="The Man Everybody Knew 2005. pp. 139-141" /&gt;

The attorney handling Mrs. King's slander suit against Barton had paid to typeset King's novel, arranged to have Barton arrested, and offered to rescind the slander lawsuit against Barton upon a settlement paid to King.  King's attorney was later disbarred in 1936.&lt;ref name="The Man Everybody Knew 2005. pp. 139-141"/&gt;

===Death===
Bruce Barton died at his home at 117 East 55th Street in [[New York City]] in 1967.

==1925 donation request letter for Berea College==
In 1925, Barton wrote a letter to 24 rich men who all replied with at least $1,000.

{{Blockquote|Dear Mr. ''Blank'',

For the past three or four years things have been going pretty well at our house. We pay our bills, afford such luxuries as having the children's tonsils out, and still have something in the bank at the end of the year. So far as business is concerned, therefore, I have felt fairly well content.

But there is another side to a man, which every now and then gets restless. It says: "What good are you anyway? What influences have you set up, aside from your business, that would go on working if you were to shuffle off tomorrow?"

Of course, we chip in to the [[Christian Church|Church]] and the [[Salvation Army]], and dribble out a little money right along in response to all sorts of appeals. But there isn't much satisfaction in it. For one thing, it's too diffused and, for another, I'm never very sure in my own mind that the thing I'm giving to is worth a hurrah and I don't have time to find out.

A couple of years ago I said: "I'd like to discover the one place in the United States where a dollar does more net good than anywhere else." It was a rather thrilling idea, and I went at it in the same spirit in which our advertising agency conducts a market investigation for a manufacturer. Without bothering you with a long story, I believe I have found the place.

This letter is being mailed to 23 men besides yourself, twenty-five of us altogether. I honestly believe that it offers an opportunity to get a maximum amount of satisfaction for a minimum sum.

Let me give you the background.

Among the first comers to this country were some pure blooded English folks who settled in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Virginia]] but, being more hardy and venturesome than the average, pushed on west and settled in the mountains of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]]. They were stalwart lads and lassies. They fought the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|first battle]] against the British and shed the first blood. In the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]] they won the battle of [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]]. Later, under [[Andrew Jackson|Andy Jackson]], they fought and won the [[Battle of New Orleans|only land victory]] that we managed to pull off in the [[War of 1812]]. Although they lived in southern states they refused to [[Secession|secede]] in 1860. They broke off from Virginia and formed the state of [[West Virginia]]; they kept [[Kentucky]] in the Union; and they sent a million men into the northern armies. It is not too much to say that they were the deciding factor in winning the struggle to keep these United States united.

They have had a rotten deal from Fate. There are no roads into the mountains, no trains, no ways of making money. So our prosperity has circled all around them and left them pretty much untouched. They are great folks. The girls are as good looking as any in the world. Take one of them out of her two-roomed [[log cabin]] home, give her a stylish dress and a permanent wave, and she'd be a hit on [[Fifth Avenue]]. Take one of the boys, who maybe never saw a railroad [[train]] until he was 21: give him a few years of education and he goes back into the mountains as a teacher or doctor or lawyer or carpenter, and changes the life of a town or county.

This gives you an idea of the raw material. Clean, sound timber – no knots, no wormholes; a great contrast to the [[History of Immigration to the United States#Immigration 1850 to 1930|imported stuff]] with which our social settlements have to work in [[New York City|New York]] and other cities.

Now, away back in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] days, a little college was started in the [[Kentucky]] mountains. It started with faith, hope, and sacrifice, and those three virtues are the only endowment it has ever had. Yet today it has accumulated, by little gifts picked up by passing the hat, a plant that takes care of 3000 students a year. It's the most wonderful manufacturing proposition you ever heard of. They raise their own food, can it in their own [[cannery]]; milk their own cows; make brooms and weave rugs that are sold all over the country; do their own [[carpentry]], [[painting]], [[printing]], [[horseshoe]]ing, and everything, teaching every boy and girl a trade while he and she is studying. And so efficiently is the job done that –

*a room rents for 60 cents a week (including heat and light)
*meals are 11 cents apiece (yet all the students gain weight on the faire; every student gets a quart of milk a day)
*the whole cost to a boy or girl for a year's study – room, board, books, etc., – is $146. More than half of this the student earns by work; many students earn all.

One boy walked in a hundred miles, leading a cow. He stabled the cow in the village, milked her night and morning, peddled the milk, and put himself through college. He is now a [[major]] in the [[United States Army]]. His brother, who owned half of the cow, is a [[missionary]] in [[Africa]]. Seventy-five percent of the graduates go back to the mountains, and their touch is on the mountain counties of five states; better homes, better food, better child health, better churches, better schools; no more feuds; lower death rates.

Now we come to the hook. It costs this college, which is named [[Berea College|Berea]], $100 a year per student to carry on. She could, of course, turn away 1500 students each year and break even on the other 1500. Or she could charge $100 tuition. But then she would be just one more college for the well-to-do. Either plan would be a moral crime. The boys and girls in those one-room and two-room cabins deserve a chance. They are of the same stuff as [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[Daniel Boone]] and [[Henry Clay]]; they are the very best raw material that can be found in the United States.

I have agreed to take ten boys and pay the deficit on their education each year, $1,000. I have agreed to do this if I can get twenty-four other men who will each take ten. The president, [[PhD|Dr.]] [[William J. Hutchins (Berea College)|William J. Hutchins]] ([[Yale]] 1892), who ought to be giving every minute of his time to running the college, is out passing the hat and riding the rails from town to town. He can manage to get $50,000 or $70,000 a year. I want to lift part of his load by turning in $25,000.

This is my proposition to you. Let me pick out ten boys, who are as sure blooded Americans as your own sons, and just as deserving of a chance. Let me send you their names and tell you in confidence, for we don't want to hurt their pride, where they come from and what they hope to do with their lives. Let me report to you on their progress three times a year. You write me, using the enclosed envelope, that, if and when I get my other twenty-three men, you will send President Hutchins your check for $1,000. If you will do this I'll promise you the best time you have ever bought for a thousand dollars.

Most of the activities to which we give in our lives stop when we stop. But our families go on; and young life goes on and matures and gives birth to other lives. For a thousand dollars a year you can put ten boys or girls back into the mountains who will be a [[Progressivism|leavening influence]] in ten towns or counties, and their children will bear the imprint of your [[Philanthropy|influence]]. Honestly, can you think of any other investment that would keep your life working in the world so long a time after you are gone?

This is a long letter, and I could be writing a piece for the magazines and collecting for it in the time it has taken me to turn it out. So, remember that this is different from any other appeal that ever came to you. Most appeals are made by people who profit from a favorable response, but this appeal is hurting me a lot more than it can possibly hurt you.
What will you have, ten boys or ten girls?

Cordially yours,

Bruce Barton [https://web.archive.org/web/20070209182147/http://www.copywritingbootcamp.com:80/alpha/files/LostSecrets.pdf 1] }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1606">'''Build to stock''', or '''make to stock''', often abbreviated as '''BTS''' or '''MTS''', is a build-ahead production approach in which production plans may be based upon sales forecasts and/or historical demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry|first=Glenn|last2=Graves|first2=Andrew|title=Build to order: the road to the 5-day car|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-84800-224-6|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtOiA6aW7VAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; BTS is a usually associated with the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] [[mass production]] techniques, where in anticipation of demand vast quantities of goods are produced and stocked in warehouses.

==Overview==
Build to stock is frequently considered as an appropriate solution for products where there are few product lines and long changeover times between costly products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Build to Stock Inventory model|url=http://www.leanmanufacture.net/operations/buildtostock.aspx|work=leanmanufacture.net|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some firms build all their products to order while others build them to stock. Given the widespread proliferation of products, there are a number of manufacturers taking a hybrid approach, where some items are built to stock and others are built to order.

Build to stock has been replaced in many industries by ''[[build to order]]'', where items are produced to specific [[sales order]]s.

A '''business park''' or '''office park''' is an area of land in which many [[office building]]s are grouped together. {{cnspan|text=All of the work that goes on is [[commerce|commercial]], not large-scale [[industry|industrial]] nor [[residential]].|date=November 2015}}  The first office park opened in [[Mountain Brook, Alabama]], in the early 1950s to avoid racial tension in city centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zak|first1=Dan|title=The old suburban office park is the new American ghost town|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-old-suburban-office-park-is-the-new-american-ghost-town/2015/07/20/b8e7653a-1f6e-11e5-bf41-c23f5d3face1_story.html|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are popular in many [[suburban]] locations, where development is cheaper because of the lower land costs and the lower building costs for building wider, not necessarily higher. Some businesses prefer the larger floorplates as more efficient, reducing time lost moving between floors.  They are also often located near motorways or main roads for easy access.

== Criticism ==
The impact of these areas on the urban fabric has been criticized:
*Spaces escape the control of the built realm: voids between fragments of unconnected residential schemes, gaps between urbanized zones, abandoned farmland, etc.  A new approach to spacial organization arises with the ease that characterizes any new consumer good, an approach which questions the conventional references of urbanism: the so-called 'commercial, industrial, business and theme park'. 
*The urbanized park originally sprang from the hybridization of the [[Garden city movement|garden-city]] and Anglo-Saxon [[campus|university campus]] models.  It adopted the former's low-rise buildings and attention to free spaces as a way of shaping the environment, and the latter's autonomous constructions.  In sum, parks are thematic precincts of autonomous architectural set pieces arranged around parking lots and communal services, and are situated at the most accessible points of the metropolitan road network.

'''Commonwealth Oil Refineries''' (COR) was an [[Australia]]n oil company that operated between 1920 and 1952 as a joint venture of the Australian government and the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]].

==Early history==

The partnership was established in 1920 on the initiative of [[Australian Prime Minister|prime minister]] [[Billy Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Fitzhardinge  |first=L.

In 1924 it opened Australia's first oil refinery near [[Laverton, Victoria]], north of the [[Port Fairy railway line|Melbourne - Geelong railway]], adjacent to Kororoit Creek Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Altona and Laverton: Industrial Development|url=http://www.alhs.com.au/altona-laverton-history/a-history-of-altona/industrial-development.html|publisher=Altona and Laverton Historical Society|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Commonwealth Oil Refineries (Australia) | title=The romance of the C.O.R. : a great national institution | publication-date=1938 | publisher=C.O.R | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18541936 | accessdate=20 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery received its first shipment of crude oil on 12 March 1924, with product coming "on-stream" on 17 May 1924. The refinery had an annual processing capacity of 100,000 tons of crude oil. The refinery was shut down on 6 August 1955, eclipsed by much larger refineries being built around the country.

In the 1930s the company was involved in oil search ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Amos, D. J.

==BP==
In 1952, the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government sold the Australian government's interest in COR to the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], which became the [[British Petroleum|British Petroleum Company]] (BP) in 1954.

In 1955 it developed a refinery at [[Kwinana, Western Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Commonwealth Oil Refineries (Australia) | author2=Australasian Petroleum Refinery Ltd | title=And now Kwinana | publication-date=1955 | publisher=Australasian Petroleum Refinery in conjunction with C.O.R | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/19772544 | accessdate=20 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BP/COR==
Between 1952 and 1959, BP Australia branded its standard-grade petrol as COR, but then dropped the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''company register''' is a register of organizations in the jurisdiction they operate under.&lt;ref name="Bank2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=World Bank|title=Doing Business 2015: Going Beyond Efficiency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hGIBCAAAQBAJ|date=24 October 2014|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-1-4648-0352-9|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[statistical business register]] has a different purpose than a company register. While a '''commercial/trade register''' serves a purpose of protection, accountability and control, a statistical register plays a central part in a system of official economic statistics at a [[national statistics office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/coded_files/RITZEN_Jean_SBR.pdf|title=Statistical Business Register: Content, place and role in Economic Statistics.|last=Ritzen|first=Jean|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Netherlands|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company registers in the world ==
{{main article|List of company registers}}

Each country's company register has different registrar types, contents, purpose, and public availability.

=== Registrar ===

A [[Registrar of companies|registrar]] is a public authority responsible for managing the registry of companies. A companies registry can be managed by courts (Germany, Austria, Hungary), government offices (United Kingdom, Ukraine), or chambers of commerce (Italy).

=== Openness ===

According to ratings published by the website [[OpenCorporates]], [[Denmark]] and [[United Kingdom]] are the leaders with regard to openness of information available in a company's register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://registries.opencorporates.com/|title=Open Company Data Index|website=registries.opencorporates.com|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registries/registrars in these countries are named, correspondingly, [[Central Business Register (Denmark)|Central Business Register]] and [[Companies House]].

He has faced charges of [[match fixing]] in Italy since 2011 and Hungary since 2013 as part of the [[2011–12 Italian football scandal|''Calcio scommesse'' scandal]]. Despite [[Interpol]] considering him the "boss" of the "world's largest and most aggressive match-fixing syndicate",&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; he was not arrested in Singapore until late 2013 since it lacks an [[extradition treaty]] with the [[European Union]].

By early 2013, he was a salaried employee, an investor, and a high-stakes gambler.&lt;ref name=hooo/&gt; He has a young son and his current wife, the [[mainland China|Chinese]] national&lt;ref name=hooo/&gt; Guan Enmei, is thought to be his third.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/dan-tan-the-man-who-fixed-football-8554751.html | title=Dan Tan: the man who fixed football | work=The Independent | date=29 March 2013 | accessdate=30 November 2013|author=Buncombe, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live modestly and ''[[The Straits Times]]'' has reported that his friends call him "[[Diminutive#Chinese|Ah]] Blur" from his obliviousness. They describe him as "very jovial and happy-go-lucky" and say he only occasionally watches football, spending most free time watching the stock market.&lt;ref name=hooo/&gt;

In 2012, Tan and his family disconnected their phones&lt;ref name=hooo&gt;Ho, Stanley.

== Match fixing ==
Dan Tan served less than a year in jail in the early 1990s for illegal [[horse-racing]] and [[association football|football]] [[bookmaking]].&lt;ref name="Asia One"/&gt; He has admitted to having served as the director of the Singaporean company Exclusive Sports PTE Ltd,&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; a rebranding of Football4U,&lt;ref&gt;Also written Football Four U and Football 4 U.&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded by convicted match-fixer [[Wilson Raj Perumal]].&lt;ref name=inviking&gt;"[http://www.invisible-dog.com/interview_wilson_eng.html Interview with the Kelong King: Wilson Raj Perumal]".

Tan's involvement with the company, however, was short-lived, lasting only from November 2010 to February 2011.&lt;ref name=z4/&gt; He later professed he withdrew his investments upon discovering their dodgy practices.&lt;ref name=hooo/&gt; The span of his involvement parallels the company's failed attempt to buy the right to showcase its players with the [[Finnish football|Finnish club]] [[Tampere United]] for €300,000.&lt;ref name=z4&gt;Zaihan Mohamed Yusof.

In November 2010, the [[Lega Pro|3rd-division]] [[U.S. Cremonese|Cremonese]] were drugged by their [[soccer goalie|goalkeeper]] [[Marco Paoloni]] in a failed attempt to throw the match to the underdog [[Paganese Calcio 1926|Paganese]].

In [[economics]], '''diminishing returns''' is the decrease in the [[Marginalism|marginal]] (incremental) output of a [[production (economics)|production]] process as the amount of a single [[Factors of production|factor of production]] is incrementally increased, while the amounts of all other factors of production stay constant.

The law of diminishing returns states that in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production, while holding all others constant ("''[[ceteris paribus]]''"), will at some point yield lower incremental per-unit returns.&lt;ref name=Samuelson2001p110&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul A. |last1=Samuelson |author1-link=Paul Samuelson |first2=William D. |last2=Nordhaus |title=Microeconomics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2001 |isbn=0071180664 |pages=110 |edition=17th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law of diminishing returns does not imply that adding more of a factor will decrease the ''total'' production, a condition known as '''negative returns''', though in fact this is common.

A common example is adding more people to a job, such as the assembly of a car on a [[shop floor|factory floor]]. At some point, adding more workers causes problems such as workers getting in each other's way or frequently finding themselves waiting for access to a part. In all of these processes, producing one more unit of output per unit of time will eventually require increasingly more usage of the input, due to the input being used less effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Henry|title=The Science of Political Economy|publisher=Robert Schalkenbach Foundation|location=New York|url=http://schalkenbach.org/library/henry-george/science-of-political-economy/spe304.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-studied example is [[The Mythical Man-Month|throwing more headcount at software development]], yielding [[Brooks's law]]. 

The law of diminishing returns is a fundamental principle of economics.&lt;ref name=Samuelson2001p110/&gt; It plays a central role in [[production theory basics|production theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=26 Jan 2013|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|isbn=9781593392925|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/163723/diminishing-returns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

The concept of diminishing returns can be traced back to the concerns of early economists such as [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Jacques Turgot]], [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The wealth of nations|publisher=Thrifty books|isbn=9780786514854|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Wealth-Nations-Adam-Smith/dp/1604598913}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Steuart (economist)|James Steuart]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. However, classical economists such as Malthus and Ricardo attributed the successive diminishment of output to the decreasing quality of the inputs. Neoclassical economists assume that each "unit" of labor is identical. Diminishing returns are due to the disruption of the entire productive process as additional units of labor are added to a fixed amount of capital. The law of diminishing returns remains an important consideration in farming.

==Example==
[[File:Total, Average, and Marginal Product.gif|thumb|right|As labor usage increases from L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, total output (measured vertically in the top graph) increases by the amount shown. But if labor usage is increased by the same amount again, output goes up by less, implying diminishing marginal returns to the use of labor as an input. The marginal product of labor (measured vertically in the bottom graph) is diminishing everywhere to the right of point A]]

An example is a factory that has a fixed stock of capital, or tools and machines, and a variable supply of labor. As the firm increases the number of workers, the total output of the firm grows but at an ever-decreasing rate. This is because after a certain point, the factory becomes overcrowded and workers begin to form lines to use the machines. The long-run solution to this problem is to increase the stock of capital, that is, to buy more machines and to build more factories.

==Returns and costs==
There is an inverse relationship between returns of inputs and the cost of production. Suppose that a kilogram of seed costs one [[dollar]], and this price does not change. Although there are other costs, assume they do not vary with the amount of output and are therefore [[fixed cost]]s. One kilogram of seeds yields one ton of crop, so the first ton of the crop costs one dollar to produce. That is, for the first ton of output, the [[marginal cost]] of the output is $1 per ton. If there are no other changes, then if the second kilogram of seeds applied to land produces only half the output of the first, the marginal cost would equal $1 per half ton of output, or $2 per ton. Similarly, if the third kilogram of seeds yields only a quarter ton, then the marginal cost equals $1 per quarter ton or $4 per ton. Thus, diminishing marginal returns imply increasing marginal costs and rising average costs.

Cost can also be measured in terms of [[opportunity cost]]. In this case the law also applies to societies – the opportunity cost of producing a single unit of a good generally increases as a society attempts to produce more of that good. This explains the bowed-out shape of the [[production possibilities frontier]].

'''Downtown West''' is an official neighborhood in [[Minneapolis]], part of the larger [[Central, Minneapolis|Central community]]. It is the heart of downtown Minneapolis (and Minneapolis as a whole), containing the bulk of high-rise office buildings in the city, and is what comes to mind when most Minneapolitans think of "downtown". Its boundaries are as follows (going in a clockwise direction): 12th Street to the southwest, 3rd Avenue North, Washington Avenue North, and [[Hennepin Avenue]] to the northwest, the [[Mississippi River]] to the northeast, and Portland Avenue, 5th Street South, and 5th Avenue South to the southeast. It is bordered by the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|North Loop]], [[Nicollet Island/East Bank, Minneapolis|Nicollet Island/East Bank]], [[Downtown East, Minneapolis|Downtown East]], [[Elliot Park, Minneapolis|Elliot Park]], and [[Loring Park, Minneapolis|Loring Park]] neighborhoods. Downtown West is home to most of Minneapolis's most notable buildings like the [[Foshay Tower]] and [[IDS Center]]. Being next to the neighborhood [[Loring Park, Minneapolis|Loring Park]] which has a substantial population of gay people, it is unsurprising that Downtown West has a few gay bars such as [[The Saloon, Minneapolis|The Saloon]].

'''Edmund Clarence Stedman''' (October 8, 1833 – January 18, 1908) was an [[United States|American]] [[poet]], [[critic]], [[essayist]], [[banker]], and [[scientist]].

==Biography==
Edmund Clarence Stedman was born in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], on October 8, 1833; his father, Major Edmund Burke Stedman died of [[tuberculosis]] two years later in December 1835.&lt;ref name=Scholnick13&gt;Scholnick, Robert J. ''Edmund Clarence Stedman''. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1977: 13. {{ISBN|0-8057-7188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the following spring, his mother [[Elizabeth Clementine Stedman]] moved the boy and his younger brother to [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] to live with her wealthy father, [[David Low Dodge]].&lt;ref name=Scholnick13/&gt; Dodge, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and pacifist, was strict, did not want to use his finances to support his grandchildren, and often physically punished the boys for bad behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Scholnick, Robert J. ''Edmund Clarence Stedman''. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1977: 14. {{ISBN|0-8057-7188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Stedman sold poems and stories to magazines including ''[[Graham's Magazine]]'', ''[[Sartain's Magazine]]'', ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', and ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'' for income.&lt;ref&gt;Scholnick, Robert J. ''Edmund Clarence Stedman''. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1977: 15. {{ISBN|0-8057-7188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the children were taken in by their paternal grandfather, Griffin Stedman, and his brother James in [[Norwich, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholnick, Robert J. ''Edmund Clarence Stedman''. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1977: 14–15. {{ISBN|0-8057-7188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stedman studied two years at [[Yale University]]; became a journalist in [[New York City]], especially on the staffs of the ''[[New York Tribune|Tribune]]'' and ''[[New York World|World]]'', for which latter paper he served as field correspondent during the first years of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  As opportunity offered, he studied law and was for a time private secretary to [[Edward Bates|Attorney-General Bates]] at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and was a member of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in [[Wall Street]] from 1865 to 1900. His first book, ''Poems, Lyrical and Idyllic'', appeared in 1860, followed by successive volumes of similar character, and by collected editions of his verse in 1873, 1884 and 1897. His longer poems are ''Alice of Monmouth: an Idyl of the Great War'' (1864); ''The Blameless Prince'' (1869), an allegory of good deeds, supposed to have been remotely suggested by the life of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]]; and an elaborate commemorative ode on [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], read before the Harvard [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] in 1877.

An idyllic atmosphere is the prevalent characteristic of his longer pieces, while the lyric tone is never absent from his songs, ballads and poems of reflection or fancy. As an editor he put forth a volume of ''Cameos'' from [[Walter Savage Landor]] (with [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], 1874); a large Library of (selections from) American Literature (with Ellen M Hutchinson, 11 vols, 1888–1890); a ''Victorian Anthology'' (1895); and an ''American Anthology, 1787-1899'' (1900); the two last-named volumes being ancillary to a detailed and comprehensive critical study in prose of the whole body of English poetry from 1837, and of American poetry of the 19th century.

This study appeared in separate chapters in ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'' (which closed in 1881 and was relaunched the same year as the ''[[Century Magazine]]''), and was reissued, with enlargements, in the volumes entitled ''Victorian Poets'' (1875; continued to the Jubilee year in the edition of 1887) and ''Poets of America'' (1885), the two works forming the most symmetrical body of literary criticism yet published in the United States. Their value is increased by the treatise on ''The Nature and Elements of Poetry'' (Boston, 1892) a work of great critical insight as well as technical knowledge.

Stedman edited, with Ellen M. Hutchinson, ''A Library of American Literature'' (eleven volumes, 1888–90); and, with [[George Edward Woodberry|George E. Woodberry]], the ''Works of Edgar Allan Poe'' (ten volumes, 1895). After the death of [[James Russell Lowell]], Stedman had perhaps the leading place among American poets and critics. In 1876, he was one of several poets who were gently mocked by [[Bayard Taylor]] in his verse parody ''The Echo Club and Other Literary Diversions''.&lt;ref&gt;Wermuth, Paul C. ''Bayard Taylor''. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1973: 163. {{ISBN|0-8057-0718-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Edmund Clarence Stedman was one of the first seven chosen for membership in the [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

In addition to his literary achievements, Stedman pursued scientific and technical endeavors. In 1879, he proposed a [[rigid airship]] inspired by the anatomy of a fish, with a framework of [[steel]], [[brass]], or [[copper]] tubing and a [[Tractor configuration|tractor]] propeller mounted on the craft{{'}}s [[Bow (ship)|bow]], later changed to an engine with two propellers suspended beneath the framework. The airship never was built, but its design foreshadowed that of the [[dirigible]]s of the early decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, Arch. ''The Zeppelin Fighters''. New York: Ace Books, 1966: 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eduardo Eurnekian''' ({{lang-arm|Էդուարդո Էռնեկյան}}; born 1932) is an Argentine [[billionaire]] businessman of Armenian descent. As of March 2013, he is the second richest person in Argentina.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

==Early life==
Eduardo Eurnekian was born to Armenian immigrant parents on 4 December 1932. His family established a textile manufacturer which prospered with the [[Argentine economy]] and became an important supplier to international sporting apparel firm [[Puma AG|Puma]]; but which, like many Argentine textile makers, nearly collapsed after Economy Minister [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]]'s round of [[free trade]] and deregulatory policies led to a severe crisis, in 1981.&lt;ref name=cilicia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cilicia.com/armo22_eduardo_eurnekian.html |title=Eduardo Eurnekian |publisher=cilicia.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The Eurnekian family reportedly borrowed heavily from the former Argentine small business lender, BANADE, and in 1988, Eduardo Eurnekian purchased "Cablevisión S.A," then a failing local [[cable tv]] station. His investment became increasingly lucrative following Economy Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]]'s implementation of the [[Argentine Currency Board|Convertibility Plan]] in 1991, which brought financial and price stability to Argentina during the 1990s. Eurnekian in 1994 sold a 51% stake in Cablevision S.A. (by then Argentina's second-largest cable operator), to [[Tele-Communications Inc.]] for US$350&amp;nbsp;million and in 1997, netted US$320&amp;nbsp;million by selling most of his remaining shares to local investment giant CEI Citicorp Holdings SA.&lt;ref name=cilicia/&gt;

Eurnekian also held controlling interest in "América TV", four radio stations and a Buenos Aires financial daily, ''[[El Cronista]]''. "[[Aeropuertos Argentina 2000]]," a consortium led by Eurnekian won a 30-year concession in 1998 to run 33 of the Argentina's main airports. He also bought the [[Howard Johnson's]] master franchise in Argentina from [[Cendant]], and invested in a regional airline company, [[Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas|LAPA]].&lt;ref name=cilicia/&gt;

==Investments in Armenia==
On 17 December 2001, Eurnekian's [[Corporación América]] signed a 30-year concession agreement with the [[Armenian government]] for the management of operations of [[Zvartnots International Airport]], which is Armenia's largest airport.&lt;ref name="rferl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2001/12/2-TCA/tca-181201.asp |title= Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Newsline 2001-12-18 |publisher=rferl.org|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company launched the construction of a new [[Airport terminal|terminal]] which brought the airport into conformity with international standards. The total cost of the project was more than $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="hyeforum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyeforum.com/index.php?showtopic=6029 |title= HyeForum - Argentine Tycoon Ernekian To Manage Zvartnots Airport |publisher=hyeforum.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurnekian also unveiled plans to invest millions of dollars into Armenia's agribusiness sector as he set up a [[joint venture]] with a local firm. Senior executives from ''Tierras de Armenia'', a [[Yerevan]]-based company belonging to Eurnekian, and the Max Group (owned by [[Harutiun Pambukian]], a parliamentarian close to former President [[Robert Kocharian]]), reported a US$25&amp;nbsp;million joint venture to develop 60&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (24&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of arid land in the southern [[Armavir (province)|Armavir]] region into fruit orchards and a fruit processing plant.

Eurnekian has built an almost $1&amp;nbsp;billion media empire since the early 1990s and is now the majority owner of a consortium operating 76 airports worldwide, mostly across Argentina and elsewhere in South America as well as in Armenia. He also owns 2,000 square kilometres of land and food processing factories in northern Argentina. He has been awarded as the "Business Man of the year" in 1995. In 1999 he received in Italy the "Leonardo Award", given to the foreign businessman of the year. He also received the highest awards in Armenia for his activities.&lt;ref name=cilicia/&gt; In 2012 he was awarded the Business for Peace award in Oslo, Norway.&lt;ref name="businessforpeace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessforpeace.no/2012-honourees/|title=Unsupported Browser|publisher=businessforpeace.no|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Eurnekian is single, and his "chosen successor" is his nephew Martin Eurnekian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-10/argentine-billionaire-to-pass-baton-to-nephew-with-airport-ipo|title=Argentine Billionaire to Pass Baton to Nephew in Airport IPO|author= Charlie Devereux |date=10 January 2018 |website=www.bloomberg.com |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-22/how-a-billionaire-argentine-family-manages-succession-and-strife|title=How a Billionaire Argentine Family Manages Succession and Strife|author= Tom Metcalf

'''Ferdinand Christian Salling''' (10 May 1880 – 22 June 1953) was a Danish [[merchant]] and entrepreneur who founded one of the largest warehouse chains and companies in [[Denmark]]. Ferdinand Salling founded the [[Salling]] warehouse chain and the company that would later own most of [[Dansk Supermarked]]. Hans Christian Salling married Karen Marie Jensen (1838–1919) on 30 July 1918 and the couple had the son [[Herman Salling]].&lt;ref name="DSD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Handel_og_industri/Direkt%C3%B8r/Ferdinand_Salling |title=Ferdinand Salling |publisher=[[Gyldendal]]s Encyclopedia ''Den Store Danske'' |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kj6U0aLI?url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Handel_og_industri/Direkt%C3%B8r/Ferdinand_Salling |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Frederik_Ferdinand_Salling |title=Frederik Ferdinand Salling |publisher=Aarhus City Archives |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kj6UTjtK?url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Frederik_Ferdinand_Salling |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdinand Salling's parents were Hans Christian Salling (1841–1923) and Karen Marie Jensen (1838–1919). After completing school Ferdinand was given an apprenticeship at ''Ulrich Marcussen'' [[Fredericia]]. Salling later moved on to work for ''P. Sieburg'' [[Odense]] and Alfred Zacho in [[Randers]]. In Randers Ferdinand had to manage the store for some time during the illness of his boss. His time in Randers may have given him the experience and confidence his own business. On 19 October 1906 he opened the store "Ferdinand Salling" in [[Aarhus]]. Initially he sold furniture for bedrooms and appliances but the stock soon expanded. In 1912 he moved to larger rooms in ''Søndergade'' 27 and later had the building at ''Søndergade'' 29 added. The business grew gradually and over time he bought more properties in the vicinity. During the [[Second World War]] expansion was stymied but in 1946 they were resumed.

In 1948 the beginnings of ''[[Salling|Salling Stormagasin]]'' was established. The company was changed to a [[limited company]] and at the time it was the largest retail outlet in the city. When Salling died the company was taken over byhs 33 yyear old son [[Herman Salling]].&lt;ref name="Salling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sallingfondene.dk/fondene/historie/ |title=Historie |publisher=[[Salling]] |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kj6V1aDA?url=http://sallingfondene.dk/fondene/historie/ |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gravsted"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=ferdinandsalling |title=FerdinandSalling |publisher=Gravsteder |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923180207/http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=ferdinandsalling |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flugschein.JPG|right|thumb|An [[airline ticket]] showing the price in the ISO 4217 code "[[Euro|EUR]]" (''bottom left'') and not the [[currency sign]] [[Euro sign|€]]]]

'''ISO 4217''' is a standard first published by [[International Organization for Standardization]] in 1978, which delineates [[currency]] designators, [[country code]]s (alpha and numeric), and references to minor units in three tables:
* Table A.1 – ''Current currency &amp;amp; funds code list''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html|title=Current currency &amp; funds code list – ISO Currency|website=SIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Table A.2 – ''Current funds codes''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a2.html|title=Current funds codes list – ISO Currency|website=SIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Table A.3 – ''List of codes for historic denominations of currencies &amp;amp; funds''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a3.html|title=List of codes for historic denominations of currencies &amp; funds – ISO Currency|website=SIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tables, history and ongoing discussion are maintained by [[SIX Interbank Clearing]] on behalf of ISO and the Swiss Association for Standardization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/amendments/secretariat.html|title=Currency Code Services – ISO 4217 Maintenance Agency|accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISO 4217 code list is used in [[banking]] and [[business]] globally. In many countries the ISO codes for the more common currencies are so well known publicly that [[exchange rate]]s published in newspapers or posted in [[bank]]s use only these to delineate the currencies, instead of translated currency names or ambiguous [[currency symbol]]s. ISO 4217 codes are used on [[airline ticket]]s and international [[train]] tickets to remove any ambiguity about the price.

== Code formation ==
[[Image:South East Asia Exchange Rates (6031878489).jpg|right|thumb|A list of exchange rates for various base currencies given by a [[money changer]] in Thailand, with the Thailand Baht as the counter (or quote) currency. Note the Korean currency code should be KRW]]
The first two letters of the code are the two letters of the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] [[country code]]s (which are also used as the basis for [[Country code top-level domain|national top-level domains]] on the [[Internet]]) and the third is usually the initial of the currency itself. So [[Japan]]'s currency code is '''JPY'''—JP for Japan and Y for [[Japanese yen|yen]]. This eliminates the problem caused by the names ''[[dollar]], [[franc]], [[peso]]'' and ''[[Pound (currency)|pound]]'' being used in dozens of countries, each having significantly differing values. Also, if a currency is revalued, the currency code's last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency. In some cases, the third letter is the initial for "new" in that country's language, to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued; the code sometimes outlasts the usage of the term "new" itself (for example, the code for the [[Mexican peso]] is '''MXN'''). Other changes can be seen, however; the [[Russian ruble]], for example, changed from '''RUR''' to '''RUB''', where the B comes from the third letter in the word "ruble".

{{Numismatics}}

=== X currencies ===
In addition to codes for most active national currencies ISO 4217 provides codes for "supranational" currencies, procedural purposes, and several things which are "similar to" currencies:
* Codes for the [[precious metal]]s [[gold]] (XAU), [[silver]] (XAG), [[palladium]] (XPD), and [[platinum]] (XPT) are formed by prefixing the element's chemical symbol with the letter "X".  These "currency units" are denominated as one [[troy ounce]] of the specified metal as opposed to "USD 1" or "EUR 1". XBT is used by some exchanges for the cryptocurrency [[Bitcoin]] even though it is not ISO 4217 approved.
* The code XTS is reserved for use in testing.
* The code XXX is used to denote a "transaction" involving no currency.
* There are also codes specifying certain monetary instruments used in international finance, e.g. XDR is the symbol for [[special drawing right]] issued by the [[International Monetary Fund]].
* The codes for most [[supranational]] currencies, such as the [[East Caribbean dollar]], the [[CFP franc]], the [[CFAF|CFA franc]] BEAC and the CFA franc BCEAO.  The predecessor to the euro, the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU), had the code XEU.

The use of an initial letter "X" for these purposes is facilitated by the ISO 3166 rule that no official country code beginning with X will ever be assigned.  Because of this rule ISO 4217 can use X codes without risk of clashing with a future country code.  ISO 3166 country codes beginning with "X" are used for private custom use (reserved), never for official codes.  For instance, the ISO 3166-based [[NATO]] [[List of NATO country codes|country codes]] ([[STANAG 1059]], 9th edition) use "X" codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from XXB for "Brownland" to XXR for "Redland", as well as for major commands such as XXE for [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] or XXS for [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic|SACLANT]]. Consequently, ISO 4217 can use "X" codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future country codes.

The inclusion of EU (denoting the [[European Union]]) in the [[ISO 3166-1]] reserved codes list, allows the [[euro]] to be coded as EUR rather than assigned a code beginning with X, even though it is a supranational currency.

=== Treatment of minor currency units (the "exponent") ===
The ISO 4217 standard includes a crude mechanism for expressing the relationship between a major currency unit and its corresponding minor currency unit. This mechanism is called the currency "exponent" and assumes a base of 10. For example, USD (the [[United States dollar]]) is equal to 100 of its minor currency unit the "[[Cent (currency)|cent]]". So the USD has exponent 2 (10 to the power 2 is 100, which is the number of cents in a dollar). The code JPY ([[Japanese yen]]) is given the exponent 0, because its minor unit, the sen, although nominally valued at 1/100 of a yen, is of such [[wikt:negligible|negligible]] value that it is no longer used. Usually, as with the USD, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but in some cases (including most varieties of the dinar) 1/1000 is used, and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10. [[Mauritania]] does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 [[Mauritanian ouguiya|ouguiya]] (UM) equal to 5 [[khoums]], and [[Madagascar]] has 1 [[ariary]] = 5 [[iraimbilanja]]. Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all and these are given an exponent of 0, as with currencies whose minor units are unused due to negligible value.

=== Currency numbers ===
There is also a three-digit code number assigned to each currency, in the same manner as there is also a three-digit code number assigned to each country as part of [[ISO 3166]]. This numeric code is usually the same as the [[ISO 3166-1 numeric]] code. For example, USD ([[United States dollar]]) has code 840 which is also the numeric code for the US (United States).

== Position of ISO 4217 code in amounts {{anchor|codeposition}} {{anchor|PositionOfIso4217CodeInAmounts}} ==
The ISO standard does not regulate either the spacing, prefixing or suffixing in usage of currency codes. According however to the [[European Union]]'s Publication Office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370303.htm#position |title=Publications Office — Interinstitutional style guide — 7.3.3. Rules for expressing monetary units|first=Publications Office -|last=OP/B.3/CRI|website=publications.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[English language in England|English]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] texts, the ISO&amp;nbsp;4217 code is to be followed by a [[Non-breaking space|hard space]]&lt;ref&gt;The original document uses “hard space” NOT “fixed space” that is confusable. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space#cite_note-1&lt;/ref&gt; and the amount:

:''a sum of EUR&amp;nbsp;30''

In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] the order is reversed; the amount is followed by a [[Non-breaking space|hard space]] and the ISO&amp;nbsp;4217 code:

:''une somme de 30&amp;nbsp;EUR''

Note that, as illustrated, the order is determined not by the currency, but by the native language of the document context.

== History ==
In 1973, the ISO Technical Committee 68 decided to develop codes for the representation of currencies and funds for use in any application of trade, commerce or banking. At the 17th session (February 1978), the related [[United Nations|UN]]/[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]] Group of Experts agreed that the three-letter alphabetic codes for International Standard ISO 4217, "Codes for the representation of currencies and funds", would be suitable for use in international trade.

Over time, new currencies are created and old currencies are discontinued. Frequently, these changes are due to the formation of new governments, treaties between countries standardizing on a shared currency, or revaluation of an existing currency due to excessive inflation. As a result, the list of codes must be updated from time to time. The ISO 4217 maintenance agency (MA), [http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html SIX Interbank Clearing], is responsible for maintaining the list of codes.

The following is a list of active codes of official ISO 4217 currency names.
In the standard the values are called "alphabetic code", "numeric code", and  "minor unit".

===USD/USS/USN, three currency codes belonging to the US===
The [[US dollar]] has two codes assigned: USD and USN (next day). The USS (same day) code is not in use any longer, and was removed from the list of active ISO 4217 codes in March 2014.

According to UN/CEFACT recommendation 9, paragraphs 8–9 ECE/TRADE/203, 1996, [http://www.unece.org/cefact/recommendations/rec09/rec09_ecetrd203.pdf available online]:
: 8. In applications where monetary resources associated with a currency (i.e. funds) need not be specified and where a field identifier indicating currency is used, the first two (leftmost) characters are sufficient to identify a currency—example: US for United States dollars for general, unspecified purposes where a field identifier indicating currency is present. (A field identifier can be a preprinted field heading in an aligned document or a similarly-agreed application in electronic transmission of data.)
: 9. In applications where there is a need to distinguish between types of currencies, or where funds are required as in the banking environment, or where there is no field identifier, the third (rightmost) character of the alphabetic code is an indicator, preferably mnemonic, derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund—example: USD for general, unspecified purposes; USN for United States dollar next-day funds, and USS for funds which are immediately available for Federal Reserve transfer, withdrawal in cash or transfer in like funds (same-day funds). Since there is no need for such a distinction in international trade applications, the funds codes have not been included in the Annex to the present Recommendation.

== Future codes ==
As of August 2018, there are no new codes planned to be added to the standard.
&lt;!--
The following is a list of future codes of official ISO 4217 currency names.
In the standard the values are called "alphabetic code", "numeric code", and  "minor unit".

==Non ISO 4217 currencies==

===Currencies without ISO 4217 currency codes===
A number of currencies are not included in ISO 4217, because these currencies are: (a) minor currencies pegged 1:1 to a larger currency, even if independently regulated (b) a legal tender only issued as commemorative banknotes or coinage, or (c) a currency of an [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized or partially recognized state]]. These currencies include:
* [[Alderney pound]] (1:1 [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] to the pound sterling)
* [[Cook Islands dollar]] (1:1 pegged to the New Zealand dollar)
* [[Faroese króna]] (1:1 pegged to the Danish krone)
* [[Guernsey pound]] (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)
* [[Isle of Man pound]] (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)
* [[Jersey pound]] (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)
* [[Kiribati dollar]] (1:1 pegged to the Australian dollar)
* [[Maltese scudo]] (1:0.24 pegged to the [[euro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orderofmalta.int/catalogue/38626/a-little-history/?lang=en |title= The Order of Malta, A little history |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Sahrawi peseta]] of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] in [[Western Sahara]], sometimes given the code "EHP" but this has not been assigned by the ISO
* [[Somaliland shilling]] (state of issue is viewed as ''[[de jure]]'' part of [[Somalia]], exchange rate not fixed)
* [[Transnistrian ruble]] (state of issue is viewed as ''de jure'' part of [[Moldova]])
* [[Tuvaluan dollar]] (1:1 pegged to the Australian dollar)
* [[Zimbabwean bonds]] (1:1 pegged to the US dollar)

See [[:Category:Fixed exchange rate]] for a list of all currently pegged currencies.

=== Unofficial currency codes ===
Despite having no official recognition in ISO 4217, the following non-ISO codes are sometimes used locally or commercially.

In addition, GBX is sometimes used (for example on the London Stock Exchange) to denote [[Penny sterling]], a subdivision of pound sterling, the currency for the United Kingdom.

===Cryptocurrencies===
Recently, [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] have unofficially used ISO codes on various cryptocurrency exchanges, for instance LTC for [[Litecoin]], NMC for [[Namecoin]] and XRP for [[Ripple (payment protocol)|Ripple]]. [[SIX Interbank Clearing]] (a Maintenance Agency of ISO) is currently studying the impact and role of cryptocurrencies and other independent currencies on ISO 4217.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.six-interbank-clearing.com/dam/downloads/en/clearit/63-64/4217.pdf|title=SIX Interbank ISO 4217: A controversial standard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical currency codes ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
A number of currencies were official ISO 4217 currency codes and currency names until their replacement by the [[euro]] or other currencies. The table below shows the ISO currency codes of former currencies and their common names (which do not always match the ISO 4217 names). These codes were first introduced in december 1988 after a request from the reinsurance sector was accepted&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.currency-iso.org/dam/downloads/dl_currency_iso_amendment_24.pdf New "table 3" of historic denominations published on 14 December 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''inclusion rider''' or '''equity rider''' is a provision in a actor's or [[filmmaker]]'s contract that provides for a certain level of [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] in casting and production staff. For example, the rider might require a certain proportion of actors or staff to be women, [[people of color]], [[LGBT]] people or people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/what-is-an-inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscars-2018|title=Woman behind 'inclusion rider' explains Frances McDormand's Oscar speech|last=Belam|first=Martin|last2=Levin|first2=Sam|date=5 March 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent actors or filmmakers may use their negotiating power to insist on such provisions. The term is derived from the "[[Rider (theater)|rider]]", a provision in the contract of performing actors to ensure certain aspects of a performance such as personal amenities or technical infrastructure.

[[Image:Lars Magnus Ericsson statue Telefonplan Midsomarkransen Stockholm 2005-08-13.JPG|thumb|right|Bust of L. M. Ericsson at [[Telefonplan]] in Stockholm]]

'''Lars Magnus Ericsson''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈlɑːʂ ˈmaŋːnɵs ²eːrɪkˌsɔn|-|Sv-Lars_Magnus_Ericsson.ogg}}; 5 May 1846 – 17 December 1926) was a Swedish [[inventor]], entrepreneur and founder of [[telephone]] equipment manufacturer [[Ericsson]] ([[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as ''Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson'').

Lars Magnus was born in [[Grums Municipality|Värmskog]], [[Värmland]], and grew up in the small village of Vegerbol located between [[Karlstad]] and [[Arvika]]. At the age of 12, Ericsson's father died forcing him to seek work as a [[miner]]. He worked until he had money enough to leave the village and move to [[Stockholm]] in 1867. He then worked for six years for an instrument maker named ''Öllers &amp; Co.'' who mainly created [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] equipment. Because of his skills, he was given two state scholarships to study instrument making abroad between 1872 and 1875. One of the companies he worked at was [[Siemens AG|Siemens &amp; Halske]].

Upon his return to Sweden in 1876, he founded a small mechanical workshop together with his friend Carl Johan Andersson who had also worked at ''Öllers &amp; Co.''. This workshop was actually a former kitchen of some 13&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; situated at Drottninggatan 15 in the most central part of Stockholm. Here, he started a [[telephone]] company by analyzing Bell company and Siemens telephones and creating his own copies in their image. It was not until they started cooperating with Henrik Tore Cedergren in 1883 that the company would start to grow into the [[Ericsson]] corporation.

In the year 1900 Lars Magnus retired from Ericsson at the age of 54. He kept his shares in the company until 1905 and then sold them all.

He is said to have been a demanding person, and disliked any direct publicity about his personality and did not wish to be idolized. He was, however, deeply respected by his employees. He was always a skeptic and cautious in business. He was also somewhat opposed to [[patent]]s, as many of the products he made would not have been possible to do if the patent legislation had been overly effective. When his phones were copied by Norwegian companies he did not care, as his phones had in turn been largely copied from Siemens. He initially did not believe in a [[mass market]] for telephones, and saw it as a toy for the leisure class.

After his death in 1926, he was buried at [[Hågelby gård]] in [[Botkyrka]]. At his explicit request, there is no [[headstone]] marking his grave.

{{Basel II}}
{{Financial risk types}}
[[Basel II]] classified '''legal risk''' as a subset of [[operational risk]] in 2003. This conception is based on a business perspective, recognizing that there are threats entailed in the [[Business operations|business operating environment]]. The idea is that businesses do not operate in a vacuum and that, in the exploitation of opportunities and their engagement with other businesses, their activities tend to become subjects of [[Legal liability|legal liabilities]] and [[obligation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simple Tools and Techniques for Enterprise Risk Management|last=Chapman|first=Robert|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781119989974|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary reasons why legal risk is associated with operational risk involves [[fraud]] since it is recognized as the most significant category of operational loss events and considered to be a legal issue as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operational Risk Management|last=Moosa|first=Imad|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=9781349352951|location=New York|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, however, do not mean that legal risk is only confined to this conceptualization because it is defined in more than way. For instance, there are specific sets of legal risks that are defined by the [[European Union law|European Union (EU) Law]]. In 2005, the [[European Central Bank]] declared that it will develop its own legal risk definition to help "facilitate proper risk assessment and risk management, as well as ensure a consistent approach between EU credit institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legal Risks in EU Law: Interdisciplinary Studies on Legal Risk Management and Better Regulation in Europe|last=Mišćenić|first=Emilia|last2=Raccah|first2=Aurélien|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=9783319285955|location=Berlin|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
There is no standard definition, but there are at least two primary/secondary definition sets in circulation.

'''Mcormick, R. 2004'''
Legal risk is the risk of loss to an institution which is primarily caused by:&lt;br&gt;
(a) a defective transaction; or&lt;br&gt;
(b) a claim (including a defense to a claim or a counterclaim) being made or some other event occurring which results in a liability for the institution or other loss (for example, as a result of the termination of a contract) or;&lt;br&gt;
(c) failing to take appropriate measures to protect assets (for example, intellectual property) owned by the institution; or&lt;br&gt;
(d) change in law.&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;Roger McCormick. "Legal Risk in the Financial Markets", Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mcormick, R. 2004'''
Management of legal risk is not a precise science and subjective to the situation of the institution, and primarily caused by the lack of proper communication channel, undefined institutional objectives (such as the lack of policies and regulations), unclarified information flow between different personnel and department, lack of delegation of power to specify task on mitigation of risks.&lt;ref name="McCormick2"&gt;Roger McCormick. "The Management of Legal RIsk by Financial Institutions", RSM&lt;/ref&gt;

;Johnson and Swanson. 2007
The expenses of litigation of a company.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imanet.org/resources_and_publications/management_accounting_quarterly/issues/Fall_2007.aspx|title=Issues|author=IMA|work=imanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Whalley, M. 2016
Legal risk is the risk of financial or reputational loss that can result from lack of awareness or misunderstanding of, ambiguity in, or reckless indifference to, the way law and regulation apply to your business, its relationships, processes, products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-legal-risk-2-show-you-are-in-control/$FILE/ey-legal-risk-2-show-you-are-in-control.pdf|title=Legal risk 2.0: Show you're in control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Tsui TC. 2013
The cost and loss of income caused by legal uncertainty, multiplied by possibility of the individual event or legal environment as a whole.&lt;ref name="Tsui"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2260965|title=Experience from the Anti-Monopoly Law Decision in China (Cost and Benefit of Rule of Law)|work=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most obvious legal risks of doing business not mentioned in the above definitions is the risk of arrest and prosecution.

All definitions contain more detail.

'''Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Co.''' was a [[Wall Street]] brokerage firm founded in 1931 and acquired in 1979 by [[Sanford I. Weill]]'s [[Shearson Hayden Stone]].  Although the firm would operate as [[Shearson Loeb Rhoades]] for two years, the firm would ultimately be acquired in 1981 by [[American Express]] to form [[Shearson/American Express]] and three years later [[Shearson Lehman/American Express]].

==History==
The firm was founded as '''Carl M. Loeb &amp; Co.''' by father [[Carl M. Loeb]] and son [[John Langeloth Loeb Sr.]] in 1931, shortly after the onset of the [[Great Depression]].  Carl M. Loeb &amp; Co. merged with [[Rhoades &amp; Company]], a [[white shoe firm|white shoe]] Wall Street brokerage firm, in 1937 to form what became Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Co.  Rhoades &amp; Company had been founded in 1905 by John Harsen Rhoades, Jr. (born 1869), formerly a partner of Rhoades &amp; Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03EED81738EF32A25753C3A9629C946497D6CF Told 'Round the Ticker: Rhoades &amp; Richmond have dissolved partnership].  New York Times, April 30, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; The firm operated under the Loeb, Rhoades name from 1937 through 1979 when it briefly used the name Shearson Loeb Rhoades, for two years prior to its acquisition by [[American Express]] in 1981.

Carl Loeb, who had built his personal wealth as president of [[American Metal Company]] resigned from the company and bought a seat on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], at the urging of his son John in 1931. While on the New York Stock Exchange, he pushed through many reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Stack, Elizabeth. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=139 "Carl Morris Loeb."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified September 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years after Loeb left American Metals, the company's stock was nearly worthless.&lt;ref name=loebhistory&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717025523/http://www.cjh.org/p/52?action=show&amp;id=29 |url=http://www.cjh.org/p/52?action=show&amp;id=29 |title=Fulfilling The American Dream: The History Of The Loebs From Colonial Days To The Present |archive-date=July 17, 2012 |author1-first=Kenneth |author1-last=Libo |author2-first=Michael |author2-last=Skakun |access-date=January 17, 2017 |website=Center for Jewish History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his son, Carl ran Loeb, Rhoades for its first 24 years, from 1931 until his death in 1955. John L. Loeb was a partner in the firm from 1931 to 1955 and following the death of his father became the senior partner, a role which he retained through 1977 when the firm was merged. In 1951, John Loeb became a governor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. In 1956, Loeb, Rhoades acquired a controlling interest in the [[Cuban Atlantic Sugar Company]] and sold its stake on December 31, 1958, a day before the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

In 1973, Carl M. Mueller assumed management control of the firm before Loeb resumed his management responsibilities in the firm in 1977.  Loeb oversaw the merger of Loeb, Rhoades with [[Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes &amp; Trask]] to form Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower &amp; Co. in January 1978 before handing over day to day control of the firm to his nephew, Thomas Kempner, a grandson of Carl Loeb who had joined the firm in 1950.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

The Hornblower merger turned out to be disastrous for Loeb, Rhoades.  The two firms incurred significant costs attempting to merge their back office operations, both of which had issues prior to the merger.  By the end of 1978, less than a year after the merger, the combined firm was losing millions of dollars.  Through the 1960s and 1970s, [[Sanford I. Weill]] was acquiring brokerage firms and by 1979 was running [[Shearson Hayden Stone]], the culmination of nearly a dozen acquisitions.  By early 1979, Loeb, Rhoades, now known as Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower &amp; Co. was suffering and looking for a potential acquiror.  During Mothers Day Weekend 1979, Loeb and Shearson agreed to a merger to form [[Shearson Loeb Rhoades]].  Weill was named the CEO of the combined firm and John Loeb became the firm's chairman.  At the time, Shearson Loeb Rhoades was among the largest investment banking houses with $250 million of equity capital.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loebcap.com/timeline/index.html |title=Loeb Capital Partners timeline |publisher=Loebcap.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227032708/https://www.loebcap.com/timeline/index.html |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8OACAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 The Urge to Merge].  New York Magazine, May 28, 1979, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Shearson Loeb Rhoades bought the Boston Company, a money manager. The same year, Weill sold the combined company to [[American Express]] to form [[Shearson/American Express]].

==Loeb Partners Corporation==
Loeb Partners Corporation, a registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, had close ties with Loeb, Rhoades.  Loeb Partners Corporation was founded by Thomas L. Kempner in 1982 to focus on managing assets for the Loeb family, wealthy clientele and institutions. Kempner, a grandson of Carl M. Loeb, was the final chairman of Loeb, Rhoades, serving from 1978 until the sale of the company in 1979.

Loeb Partners launched the Loeb Arbitrage Fund  in 1988 as an investment vehicle for the Loeb family and other [[family office]] clients.

In 2008, Loeb Capital Management, a d/b/a for Loeb Arbitrage Management, Loeb Offshore Management and Carl M. Loeb Advisory Partners Inc., was launched under common control with Loeb Partners Corporation.

In 2013 Loeb Capital Management was renamed Loeb King Capital Management.

'''Mahmud Dantata''' (1922–1983) was a Nigerian businessmen and politician who represented Kano East  under the platform of [[Northern People's Congress|NPC]] in the Nigerian House of Representatives from 1965 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Ivan H.|title=Ethnic enterprise in America : business and welfare among Chinese, Japanese and Blacks|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520024854|page=312|edition=3. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dantata was originally sympathetic to the cause of the opposition party NEPU, led by Aminu Kano but after an incarceration, he aligned with the dominant party to defeat Aminu Kano for a seat in the House of Representatives in 1964.

==Life==
Dantata was born in the Sareri quarters of [[Kano]] in 1922. The son of [[Alhassan Dantata]], a wealthy merchant, Dantata completed his formal education at Achimota College, in Ghana. Thereafter, he joined his father's business in 1945. In 1949, he branched out on his own, setting up investments in an hotel, sugar mill and petrol stations. His hotel was built in Koki quarters of Kano, a predominantly Muslim quarters where earlier attempts to build an hotel had been rejected. By 1951, he started exploring ways to transport pilgrims by road through Sudan to Saudi Arabia. He co-founded a pilgrimage business which was known as West African Pilgrimage Association (WAPA), and acquired buses for the transportation of pilgrims. A year later, he started a chartered flight service to transport pilgrims from Kano. In the Fagge quarters of Kano, he reclaimed a swampy land to build WAPA house, the area later became known for currency trading. Dantata himself soon dedicated a section of his business to currency trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hashim|first1=Yahaya|last2=Meagher|first2=Kate|title=Cross-border trade and the parallel currency market - trade and finance in the context of structural adjustment : a case study from Kano, Nigeria : [a report from the research programme The Political and Social Context of Structural Adjustment in Africa]|date=1999|publisher=Nordiska Afrikainstitutet|location=Uppsala|isbn=9171064494|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, he was charged with illegal printing of currency notes, he was found guilty and sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. After his release, he switched political allegiance to NPC and won a parliamentary election to represent Kano East. In 1967, WAPA house diversified into lodging, night club and cinema and the businesses where managed by Sabo Bakin Zuwo who later became Kano state's governor in 1983.

'''Main Street Market Square Historic District''' is a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] in [[Houston]] that includes the [[Market Square Park]].  It includes buildings nearby, as well as the square itself.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

The Main Street Market Square District has irregular boundaries.  The district includes all of the blocks between Travis and Main from Texas Street to the northern boundary of University of Houstown-Downtown.  From the southern edge of Market Square at Preston Street, it captures all of the blocks northward until [[Buffalo Bayou]].  It includes three and a half blocks between Main and Fannin Streets, running south from Franklin Street.  A wedge-shaped, partial block at Milam falls within the district, as well as a partial block east of Main Street at the base of the viaduct.&lt;ref name=boundaries&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Street Market Square: Boundaries|url=http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/HistoricPres/HistoricPreservationManual/historic_districts/main_street_boundaries.html|publisher=City of Houston Planning and Development Department|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Merchants and Manufacturers Building (bayou view) Houston.jpg|190px|left|thumb|{{nowrap|One Main Building}} (formerly the [[Merchants and Manufacturers Building]]), located on the campus of the [[University of Houston–Downtown]]]]

The [[University of Houston–Downtown]] (UHD) is a four-year state university, located within the Main Street Market Square Historic District.  Founded in 1974, it is one of four separate and distinct institutions in the [[University of Houston System|University of Houston&amp;nbsp;System]].  UHD has an enrollment of 12,900 students—making it the 13th largest public university in Texas and the second-largest university in the Houston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/Reports/PDF/1655.PDF |format=PDF|title=Texas Higher Education Enrollments |publisher=Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board |accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the anchors of the district is [[Market Square Park]], so-named because this site previously hosted four Houston City Halls and City Markets.  Adjacent to the park are three nineteenth-century structures:  the [[Fox-Kuhlman Building]] at 305-307 Travis, the [[Baker-Meyer Building]] at 315 Travis, and the [[Kennedy Bakery Building]] at 813 Congress.  Like the Kennedy Bakery Building, the property at 214 Travis had been owned by Irish-born baker, John Kennedy.  He started a building there in 1860. WL Foley Dry Goods commissioned [[Eugene Heiner]] to enlarge the structure in 1889.  Across the street at 201 Travis is the [[Houston National Bank]], once owned by [[Ross S. Sterling]].  Houston Ice and Brewing Company built the [[Magnolia Brewery Building]] at 110 Milam and the [[Magnolia Ballroom]] an adjacent facility at 715 Franklin.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Street Market Square: History and Culture|url=http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/HistoricPres/HistoricPreservationManual/historic_districts/main_street_history.html|publisher=City of Houston Planning and Development Department|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene Heiner designed two other buildings in the district: the 1882 [[Henry Brashear Building]] at 910 Prairie, and the [[Sweeney and Coombs Building]] at 310 Main.  Other historic buildings in the district along Main Street include the [[Rice Hotel]], the [[Barringer-Norton Building]], the [[Scanlan Building (Houston)]], the adjacent [[Stuart Building (Houston)|Stuart]] and [[Sterne Building (Houston)|Sterne]] Buildings, the [[Sweeney, Coombs, and Fredericks Building]], and the Union National Bank Building.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

'''Route 128''' (designated as the '''Yankee Division Highway''') is a [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, maintained by the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] (MassDOT). Spanning {{convert|57|mi|km}}, it is one of two [[Ring road|beltways]] (the other being [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]]) around [[Boston]], and is known as the "inner" beltway, especially around areas where it is {{convert|15|mi|km|round=5}} or less outside of [[Boston]]. The original 128, called the "Circumferential Highway," followed existing roadways in Boston suburbs and was designated in 1927. The present-day 128 exists as a [[controlled-access highway]] and was the first limited-access circumferential highway in the United States, the first segment of which opened in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wgbh.org/post/route-128-once-known-road-nowhere-had-traffic-jam-day-it-opened|title=Route 128, Once Known As 'Road To Nowhere,' Had A Traffic Jam The Day It Opened|last=Herwick III|first=Edgar|publisher=WGBH|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its southern terminus was previously located at the [[Braintree Split]] in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]]; currently, it exists at the interchange with [[Interstate 93]] (I-93), [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] (I-95), and [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]]. Despite no longer carrying this designation, the section of highway between Braintree and Canton continues to be informally called 128 within Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/massmarkets/2012/08/13/despite-federal-and-state-agencies-efforts-a-road-by-any-other-name-is-still-route-128/|title=Despite federal and state agencies’ efforts, a road by any other name is still Route 128|last=Chesto|first=John|publisher=Wicked Local. GateHouse Media|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its current terminus, 128 begins running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-95 and US 1. While its concurrency with US 1 ends in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], its concurrency with I-95 continues as it intersects with expressways including I-90 (the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]) in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]; [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|US 20]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]]; [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]]; [[U.S. Route 3 in Massachusetts|US 3]] in [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] (with which it runs concurrently within the town); and I-93 and US 1 again in [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]] and [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]], respectively. 128 and I-95 split in [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]]; as I-95 continues north towards New Hampshire, 128 travels east towards its northern terminus at an interchange with [[Massachusetts Route 127|Route 127A]] in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]].

In local culture, 128 is recognized as an informal dividing line between the inner municipalities of [[Greater Boston]] and the more distant suburbs. It delimits the areas accessible by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) [[public transit]] system, and is used to reference the [[high-technology industry]] that developed from the 1960s to the 1980s in the [[suburban]] areas along the highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=246 "MassMoments: Route 128 Opens Boston's High-Tech Age."] Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities.

==Route description==
[[Image:128 south end.jpg|thumb|400px|Since 1997, MA Route 128's southern end has been in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], where [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] exits south-westwards on its own roadbed, and [[Interstate 93]] north begins. [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] north continues straight.]]

128 begins in [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] in the south, at the interchange with [[Interstate 93|I-93]], [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]], and [[U.S. Route 1|US 1]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]]. Until the 1990s, its southern terminus was located at the junction of I-93, US 1, and [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]] (the [[Braintree Split]]) in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]]. At this present-day terminus, 128 becomes [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with I-95, and follows the sequential exit numbering scheme used by I-95 as it enters Massachusetts from [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. It also begins a wrong-way concurrency with US 1; as 128 and I-95 are signed traveling north, US 1 is signed traveling south, and vice versa. US 1 splits onto its own roadbed at exit 15 in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]].

About two-thirds of Route 128 runs in tandem with I-95 from Canton north to [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]], and after I-95 continues north from Peabody toward [[New Hampshire]], north-east as its own signed highway from Peabody to Gloucester. The I-95 and I-93 signage were added in the mid-1970s when plans to construct [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] through Boston, directly connecting the two I-95/Route 128 interchanges, were cancelled leaving an unsigned gap (filled in using Route 128). An unused [[Cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], now removed, was one of the leftover structures from this plan as well as the existing [[Northeast Expressway (Boston)|Northeast Expressway]] (now part of US 1.)

Until 1965, while and shortly after the [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]] freeway to Cape Cod was fully finished, the section of current Route 3 between exits 15 and 20 was also designated as Route 128. The route's southern end was then truncated to its intersection with Route 3 in Braintree. The non-freeway section of Route 128 from Route 3 through [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] to Nantasket was redesignated Route 228. The [[MassHighway|Massachusetts Highway Department]] has tried twice, in 1997 and 2003, to truncate 128 back to its intersection with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in Peabody, but local opposition has convinced them to back down.

[[Image:128 north end.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The north end of Route 128 is at [[Massachusetts Route 127|Route 127A]] in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]]. The sign pointing Route 127A south straight is incorrect; it is actually to the right, where the sign points "ALT 127".]]

The area along the western part of Route 128 is home to a number of high-technology firms and corporations. This part of Route 128 was dubbed "America's Technology Highway", and signs marking it that way were put in place beginning in October 1982. Two years later, those blue signs were  changed to read "America's Technology Region" after complaints from veterans groups that noted the highway already had a name: the [[Yankee Division]] Highway&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2011/01/09/how_bout_a_sign_for_the_times/|title=How ’bout a sign for the times?|last=Voorhis|first=Scott Van|work=Boston.com|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a name bestowed in 1941 in honor of the U.S. Army unit first formed in Boston in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1941|others=Massachusetts. General Court. Senate.|title=1941 Senate Bill 0387. An Act Designating A Certain Highway As The Yankee Division Highway.|url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/handle/2452/222918|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the I-95 signage mapping onto 128, the mapping of US 3 onto this stretch of 128 is due to US 3 as a separate limited access highway terminating in [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] on 128 instead of further south at [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] as originally envisioned. This abrupt termination requires the US 3 signage to continue along 128 for somewhat over a mile until it can interchange the old US 3 surface arterial. Moreover, when I-93 and Route 128 ran concurrently south of Boston, before the route was truncated to the I-95 interchange in Canton, they were signed in opposite directions, so it was possible to travel north on I-93 and south on Route 128 at the same time.

The northernmost several exits along Route 128, past exit 12, are not [[grade separation|grade-separated]] [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s. Exit 10 is signed as the [[traffic signal|signalized]] intersection with [[Massachusetts Route 127|Route 127]], and there are two [[rotaries (road)|rotaries]] between that and exit 12 (the Crafts Road interchange).

Following the completion of the Peabody I-95/Route 128 interchange (Exit 45/29) in 1988; the exit system was changed from concurrency along 128 to a system using the I-95 exits. The exits, which had gone from Gloucester to Braintree, were renumbered along I-95, from the [[Rhode Island]] state line to the border with [[New Hampshire]]. Exit 37 had been the interchange with I-93, which also had its exit numbered 37 at that interchange. Coincidentally, with the renumbering, exit 37 remained exit 37.

The Boston area [[Metropolitan planning organization|MPO]] studied the Route 128/I-95 Corridor from approximately 2005–2010. The study focused on the heavily congested section from I-90 (Newton) to US 3 (Burlington), and was completed in November 2010. As of 2010, the highway carried over 200,000 vehicles per day. Some possible improvements to Route 128 include [[HOV]] Lanes, reconstruction of shoulders, [[ramp metering]], bus on shoulder, and fiber optic traffic system improvements. More studies will need to be completed before projects will begin.

By 1928, it had been extended east to [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] from its south end along the following streets, ending at the intersection of [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] and [[Route 3A (southeastern Massachusetts)|Route 3A]] (now Route 3A and [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]):&lt;ref name="1928 map"&gt;1928 map of numbered routes in Boston and vicinity, prepared by the [[Massachusetts Department of Public Works]] for the New England Affairs Bureau, Boston Chamber of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

The first section of the new '''Circumferential Highway''', in no way the [[freeway]] that it is now, was the piece from [[Route 9 (Massachusetts)|Route 9]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] around the south side of Boston to [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] (now [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]) in [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]]. Parts of this were built as new roads, but most of it was along existing roads that were improved to handle the traffic. In 1931, the [[Massachusetts Department of Public Works]] acquired a [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] from [[Route 138 (Massachusetts)|Route 138]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] through [[Westwood, Massachusetts|Westwood]], [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] and [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]] to Route 9 in Wellesley. This was mostly 80 feet (24 m) wide, only shrinking to 70 feet (21 m) in Needham, in the area of Great Plain Avenue and the [[Needham Line]]. Much of this was along new alignment, but about half &amp;mdash; mostly in Needham &amp;mdash; was along existing roads:
*Royall Street from west of Route 138 to east of Green Street (Canton)
*Green Lodge Street from Royall Street (now cut by Route 128) to [[Route 128 Station]] (Canton and Westwood)
*Greendale Avenue from Lyons Street and Common Street just south of the [[Charles River]] to Hunting Avenue (Dedham and Needham)
*Fremont Street north from Highland Avenue (Needham)
*Reservoir Street from Central Avenue to Route 9 (Needham and Wellesley)&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plans:

From Route 138 in Canton east through the [[Blue Hills Reservation]] in Canton, [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]], [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] acquired a right-of-way in 1927&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Canton/Layouts/3960/3960.tif 3960] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524111915/http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Canton/Layouts/3960/3960.tif |date=2006-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and built the Blue Hill River Road. This tied into West Street in northwest Braintree, which itself had been taken over by the county in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/6741/6741-6.TIF 6741] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524111922/http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/6741/6741-6.TIF |date=2006-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Street led to [[Route 37 (Massachusetts)|Route 37]], which ran southeast to Braintree center. This part of Route 37 had been taken over by the state in 1919 (to Braintree center)&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1823/ 1823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907003218/http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1823/ |date=2006-09-07 }} (June 24, 1919)&lt;/ref&gt; and 1917 (in Braintree center).&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1765/ 1765] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907003139/http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1765/ |date=2006-09-07 }} (September 4, 1917)&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the new highway, from Route 37 east to [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] (now [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]), through Braintree, [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]] and [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], was taken over by the state in 1929. This was all along existing roads, except possibly the part of Park Avenue west of [[Route 18 (Massachusetts)|Route 18]] in Weymouth.&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plans:

By 1933,&lt;ref name="1933 map"&gt;1933 General Drafting Boston and vicinity map&lt;/ref&gt; the whole Circumferential Highway had been completed, and, except for the piece from [[Route 9 (Massachusetts)|Route 9]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] south to Highland Avenue in [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], was designated as Route 128. Former Route 128 along Highland Avenue into Needham center was left unnumbered (as was the Circumferential Highway north of Highland Avenue), but the rest of former Route 128, from Needham center east to [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], became part of [[Route 135 (Massachusetts)|Route 135]]. Thus the full route of the Circumferential Highway, as it existed by 1933, is now the following roads:

At the same time as Route 128 was extended along the new Circumferential Highway, it was extended further into [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]]. This alignment, not part of the Circumferential Highway, ran southeast on [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] (now [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]) (Whiting Street) to the border of [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] and [[Norwell, Massachusetts|Norwell]], where it turned north on present [[Route 228 (Massachusetts)|Route 228]] (Main Street) through Hingham and into [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]]. The exact route through Hingham was Main Street, Short Street, Leavitt Street, East Street, and Hull Street. The end of the numbered route was at the south end of [[Nantasket Beach, Massachusetts|Nantasket Beach]], where Nantasket Avenue curves northwest to follow the shore of [[Massachusetts Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;1937 Massachusetts Department of Public Works map of Hull&lt;/ref&gt;

==="America's Technology Highway"===
In 1955, ''Business Week'' ran an article titled "New England Highway Upsets Old Way of Life" and referred to Route 128 as "the Magic Semicircle".&lt;!--Rosegrant p 108--&gt; By 1958, it needed to be widened from four to six lanes, and business growth continued, often driven by technology out of [[Harvard University]] and [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.route128history.org/index.html "Technically, It's Still Route 128"], route128history.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, there were 99 companies employing 17,000 workers along 128; in 1965, 574; in 1973, 1,212. In the 1980s, the area was often compared to California's [[Silicon valley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1997/34/b354197.htm "BOSTON'S ROUTE 128: COMPLEMENTING SILICON VALLEY"], August 1997, Businessweek&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bizcloudnetwork.com/route-128-birthplace-of-the-digital-age-2 "Route 128: Birthplace of the Digital Age"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130628182344/http://bizcloudnetwork.com/route-128-birthplace-of-the-digital-age-2 |date=2013-06-28 }}, July 6, 2010, http://bizcloudnetwork.com {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130509024150/http://bizcloudnetwork.com/ |date=2013-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the positive effects of this growth on the Massachusetts economy were dubbed the "[[Massachusetts Miracle]]".

==Future and improvements==
===Add-A-Lane project===
The $315 million MassDOT Highway Division project has started widening on the project to upgrade the existing {{convert|14.3|mi|km|adj=on}} six-lane section of highway to eight lanes from north of Route 9 in Wellesley to Route 24 in Randolph. The project consists of adding a lane on the inside of each carriageway, complete with a 10-foot inside shoulder. The existing 1950s bridges, 22 in total, will be replaced as well. The project will be constructed in five phases over a twelve-year period. Construction of phase 1 began in 2004. The first phase of the project consisted of replacing the existing three-lane Route 128 bridges over University Avenue/MBTA/Amtrak and the Neponset River with new four-lane bridges in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]]. The project also included construction of a new two-lane ramp from Route 128 to I-95. The $33 million project was awarded to SPS New England of [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]].

During the initial construction of Route 128, a provision had already been made for a fourth lane within the widely spaced [[median]] along the 1.5-mile (2.5&amp;nbsp;km) length of Route 128 running from just north of the U.S. Route 1 interchange in Dedham, Massachusetts, north-westwards to the Route 109 interchange, and this will finally be used for the Add-A-Lane project.

Construction on phase 1 was officially completed in October 2009. Construction of phase 2 of the project began in summer 2006. This phase of the project consisted of the replacement of the Route 1 and Route 1A bridges over Route 128 in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] along with the road widening between Exits 13 and 15 (US 1). Construction of four sound barriers between the US 1 and I-95 interchanges were also included. This phase was completed in the Spring of 2011.

Construction on phase 3, begun in April 2009, widened I-93/US 1 to 4 lanes in each direction from Route 24 to the I-95 interchange. Phase 4 of the Project, which began in March 2011, is replacing seven bridges and widens Route 128 (I-95) to four lanes in each direction from Route 109 to south of Highland Avenue in Needham. The southeastern freeway (Pilgrims Highway) that extends from Braintree to Cape Cod, [[Massachusetts Route 3|MA Route 3]], is also in the process of undergoing a similar "add-a-lane" project for much of its own 42 mile length.

===Sign upgrade projects on Route 128===
Over the last fifteen or so years, the state has funded a number of highway sign resigning projects on Route 128 that are replacing the 25-year-old signs with new exit, regulatory and route signs. Starting in 1998 and continuing through 2002, signs were replaced through a $1.1 million project between Reading and Lynnfield. Progress continued in 2005 and 2006 during a $2.2 million project which replaced the signs on from Peabody to Gloucester, and continued with a $1.4 million project in 2008 and 2009 that replaced signs in Peabody and the remaining ones in Lynnfield. A $2.9 million federal stimulus project helped replace exit and highway signs in 2010 and 2011 along Route 128 (I-95) from US-3 in Lexington to I-93 in Reading.

A project begun in the Fall of 2012 and completed in the Fall of 2015, replaced exit &amp; guide signs on Route 128 from Route 9 (Exit 20) in Wellesley to Routes 4/225 (Exit 31) in Lexington and, as part of the Add-A-Lane project discussed above, new signs were put up along section of the project completed in 2015 from Great Plain Avenue in Needham to Route 109 in Dedham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gribblenation.net/mass21/i95photos.html See photos of the new signage on the I-95 in Mass. Photo Page]&lt;/ref&gt; New signage was put up between I-95 and US 1 in 2010 and most of the signage between I-95 and Route 24 (on I-93/US 1) has been replaced by the end of 2011. Future projects will replace the signs between the Rhode Island Border and I-93 in Canton in 2018 and between I-93 in Reading and US 1 in Peabody in 2019. New mileage markers were placed every 2/10 of a mile along the highway in 2010 (except for the area covered by the widening project) for I-93 between Braintree and Canton and I-95 from Canton to Peabody. New markers put along Route 128 from Peabody to Gloucester reflect the state highway's total mileage from Canton, indicating MassDOT's change of heart in decommissioning the route where it shares the road with I-95. The previous mile markers (reflected in the exit list below) had mile 0 in Peabody.

== Popular culture ==
Two songs by [[Massachusetts]] alternative rock artists, "[[Roadrunner (Jonathan Richman song)|Roadrunner]]" by [[The Modern Lovers]] and "Blue Thunder" by [[Galaxie 500]], prominently feature Route 128 in their lyrics.

==Exit list==
Exit numbers along the I-95 portion of Route 128 are in accordance to the [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts#Exit list|I-95 exit numbering scheme in Massachusetts]] . The stretch north of I-95, as well as the rest of the length before I-95 exit numbering was applied, has decreasing exit numbers traveling northbound, contrary to almost all highways in the US with numbered exits.  Route 128 currently has 18 numbered interchanges, starting at 29 (southbound) and continuing downwards to 9 (former Exit 27, an at-grade intersection, was removed, and the last two exits are at-grade intersections). This may be changed over the next few years if all freeway interchanges in Massachusetts are converted to mileage-based numbers under a project that was scheduled to start in January 2016, in order to comply with Federal regulations mandating mileage-based exit numbers on interstate highways, but that, for now, has been indefinitely postponed.&lt;ref name="Exit Numbers"&gt;{{cite web|author=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|year=2015|title=COMMBUYS - Bid Solicitation FAP# HSIP-002S(874) Exit Signage Conversion to Milepost-Based Numbering System along Various Interstates, Routes and the Lowell Connector |url=https://www.commbuys.com/bso/external/bidDetail.sdo?docId=BD-16-1030-0H100-0H002-00000005477&amp;external=true&amp;parentUrl=bid|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.malmeroads.net/mass21c/massexits.html|title=Massachusetts Highways Exit Lists|publisher=Robert H.

'''Research Park at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign''' is a [[research park]] located in the southwest part of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] campus in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], [[Illinois]]. Research Park is a technology hub for startup companies and corporate research and development operations. Within Research Park there are more than 100 companies employing more than 1,700 people including students and full-time technology professionals.

Multinational and publicly traded corporations in the Research Park include: ADM, Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie, AB InBev, Ameren, Capital One, Caterpillar, CEB, Deere &amp; Company, Dow AgroSciences, Dow Chemical, Grainger, Littelfuse, Raytheon, Riverbed, State Farm, and Yahoo.

Research Park is also home to over 50 startup companies that are commercializing technology. EnterpriseWorks, the Research Park’s 43,000-square-foot business incubator for early-stage tech firms, is operated by the University of Illinois to help launch successful startup companies.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==History==
[[File:I-Hotel Champaign.jpg|thumb|275px|I-Hotel located within Research Park in [[Champaign, Illinois]]]]
Research Park gained the approval of the Board of Trustees in November 1999 and established its governance with the University of Illinois Research Park Limited Liability Company in March 2000.  The Research Park opened its first building in 2001 and grew into a 200-acre technology hub for corporate research and development operations. 

In 2003, the State of Illinois provided funding to build the EnterpriseWorks Incubator, a 43,000 square-foot business technology incubator for early-stage tech firms, and the first tenants moved in during early 2004. In May 2000, the University entered into a partnership with Fox/Atkins who now leases the land from the University and constructs customized buildings for Research Park's tenants. The company is responsible for transforming the land from fish ponds, agricultural fields, and livestock barns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.researchpark.illinois.edu/about/developer |title=Developer Partnership &amp;#124; Research Park |website=Researchpark.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next phase of development in the new master developer agreement is to add 160 acres of additional land east of the main Research Park area. The total operation in Research Park annually contributes $4.1 million in tax revenues to the state of Illinois. The total construction over 10 years contributed $7.2 million in state tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchpark.illinois.edu/about/history |title=History &amp;#124; Research Park |website=Researchpark.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EnterpriseWorks Incubator==
[[File:EW incubator.png|thumb|EnterpriseWorks Incubator located in the University of Illinois Research Park]]
The EnterpriseWorks Incubator provides a bridge between the research of the University and the commercialization of technology by university faculty, researchers, and students. The award-winning incubator provides free counseling services to technology entrepreneurs and facilities such as laboratories, offices, conference rooms, kitchen, and co-working space. The Entrepreneur-In-Residence program is a free service provided by Research Park which consists of 7 experience tech entrepreneurs who provide monthly consulting to new startup ventures and prospective entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.researchpark.illinois.edu/resources/entrepreneur-residence-program |title=Entrepreneur in Residence Program &amp;#124; Research Park |website=Researchpark.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research Park and the EnterpriseWorks Incubator hold educational, training, social, and networking events to facilitate a community feel while providing a place where the newest startups have the opportunity to develop relationships with established national and international corporations.

{{good article}}
{{Economic systems sidebar}}
A '''Robinson Crusoe economy''' is a simple framework used to study some fundamental issues in economics.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; It assumes an economy with one consumer, one producer and two goods. The title "[[Robinson Crusoe]]" is a reference to the novel of the same name authored by [[Daniel Defoe]] in 1719.

As a thought experiment in economics, many international trade economists have found this simplified and idealized version of the story important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of [[consumer behaviour]], producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in [[public finance]] the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of [[public goods]] and certain aspects of collective benefits.&lt;ref name="pubfin"/&gt; It is used in [[growth economics]] to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.&lt;ref name="barro"/&gt;

In the Robinson Crusoe economy, there is only one individual – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as consumer to maximise his utility.&lt;ref name="RMS"/&gt; The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, [[Man Friday]]. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe. Along with this, conditions of [[Pareto Efficiency]] can be analysed by bringing in the concept of the [[Edgeworth box]].&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The basic assumptions of the Robinson Crusoe economy are as follows:&lt;ref name="cowell"/&gt; 
# The island is cut off from the rest of the world (and hence cannot trade)
# There is only a single economic agent (Crusoe himself)
# All commodities on the island have to be produced or found from existing stocks

==Framework==
[[File:Income Leisure Preference in a Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=The Robinson Crusoe Economy framework|Figure 1: Income Leisure Preference in a Robinson Crusoe Economy.]]
Robinson Crusoe is assumed to be shipwrecked on a deserted island. Similar to the choices that households (suppliers of labour) face, Crusoe has only two activities to participate in – earn income or pass his time in leisure.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The income generating activity in this case is gathering coconuts.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; As usual, the more time he spends in leisure, the less food he has to eat, and conversely, the more time he spends gathering coconuts, the less time he has for leisure. This is depicted in figure 1.
{{Clear }}

==Production function and indifference curves==
Crusoe's [[indifference curves]] depict his preferences for leisure and coconuts while the [[production function]] depicts the technological relationship between how much he works and how many coconuts he gathers. If the axes depicting coconut collection and leisure are reversed and plotted with Crusoe's indifference map and production function,&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; figure 2 can be drawn:

[[File:The Robinson Crusoe Economy's Production Function and Indifference Curves.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 2: The Robinson Crusoe Economy's Production Function and Indifference Curves]]

The production function is [[Concave function|concave]] in two dimensions and [[Quasiconvex function|quasi-convex]] in three dimensions. This means that the longer Robinson works, the more coconuts he will be able to gather. But due to diminishing marginal returns of labour, the additional number of coconuts he gets from every additional hour of labour is declining.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The point at which Crusoe will reach an equilibrium between the number of hours he works and relaxes can be found out when the highest indifference curve is tangent to the production function.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, the slope of the highest indifference curve must equal the slope of the production function.

Recall that the [[Marginal rate of substitution]] is the rate at which a consumer is ready to give up one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of utility.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt; Additionally, an input's marginal product  is the extra output that can be produced by using one more unit of the input, assuming that the quantities of no other inputs to production change.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt; Then,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt;'''

where,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Marginal Product of Labour,''' and

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = Marginal rate of substitution between Leisure and Coconuts'''

{{Clear}}

==Crusoe's multifaceted role==
Suppose Crusoe decides to stop being a producer and consumer simultaneously. He decides he will produce one day and consume the next. His two roles of consumer and producer are being split up and studied separately to understand the elementary form of consumer theory and producer theory in microeconomics. For dividing his time between being a consumer and producer, he must set up two [[collectively exhaustive]] markets, the coconut market and the labour market.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt; He also sets up a firm, of which he becomes the sole [[shareholder]]. The firm will want to maximise profits by deciding how much labour to hire and how many coconuts to produce according to their prices. As a worker of the firm, Crusoe will collect wages, as a shareholder, he will collect profits and as a consumer, he will decide how much of the firm's output to purchase according to his income and the prevailing market prices.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt; Let's assume that a currency called "Dollars" has been created by Robinson to manage his finances. For simplicity, assume that '''Price&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = $1.00'''. This assumption is made to make the calculations in the numerical example easy because the inclusion of prices will not alter the result of the analysis. For more details, refer to [[Numéraire]] commodities.

===Producer===
{{Main|Production theory}}

[[File:Profit Maximising Condition for the firm in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Figure 3: Profit Maximising Condition for the firm in the Robinson Crusoe Economy]]

Assume that when the firm produces ''C'' amount of total coconuts, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; represents its profit level. Also assume that when the wage rate at which the firm employs labour is ''w'', L amount of labour will be employed. Then,

&lt;math&gt;\Pi=C - wL \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=\Pi + wL \,&lt;/math&gt;

The above function describes iso-profit lines (the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of combinations between labour and coconuts that produce a constant profit of Π). Profits can be maximised when the marginal product of labour equals the wage rate (marginal cost of production).&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; Symbolically,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

Graphically, the iso-profit line must be tangent to the production function.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The vertical intercept of the iso-profit line measures the level of profit that Robinson Crusoe's firm will make. This level of profit, Π, has the ability to purchase Π dollars worth of coconuts. Since '''Price&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt;''' is $1.00, Π number of coconuts can be purchased. Also, the firm will declare a [[dividend]] of Π dollars. This will be given to the firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

{{Clear }}

===Consumer===
{{Main|Consumer choice}}

[[File:Robinson Crusoe's Maximisation Problem showing his budget line and indifference curve.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 4: Robinson Crusoe's Maximisation Problem showing his budget line and indifference curve]]

As a consumer, Crusoe will have to decide how much to work (or indulge in leisure) and hence consume.&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; He can choose to not work at all, since he has an endowment of Π dollars from being a shareholder.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;  Let us instead consider the more realistic case of him deciding to work for a few hours. His labour consumption choice can be illustrated in figure 4:

Note that labour is assumed to be a '[[bad (economics)|bad]]', i.e., a commodity that a consumer doesn't like. Its presence in his consumption basket lowers the utility he derives.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; On the other hand, coconuts are goods. This is why the indifference curves are positively sloped. The maximum amount of labour is indicated by L'. The distance from L' to the chosen supply of labour (L*) gives Crusoe's demand for leisure.

Notice Crusoe's budget line. It has a slope of ''w'' and passes through the point '''(0,Π)'''. This point is his endowment level i.e., even when he supplies 0 amount of labour, he has Π amount of coconuts (dollars) to consume. Given the wage rate, Crusoe will choose how much to work and how much to consume at that point where,

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

{{Clear }}

==Equilibrium==

[[File:Equilibrium in both production and consumption in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Figure 5: Equilibrium in both production and consumption in the Robinson Crusoe Economy]]

At equilibrium, the demand for coconuts will equal the supply of coconuts and the demand for labour will equal the supply of labour.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt;

Graphically this occurs when the diagrams under consumer and producer are superimposed.&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; Notice that,

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

-=&gt; '''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'''

This ensures that the slopes of the indifference curves and the production set are the same.

As a result, Crusoe ends up consuming at the same point he would have if he made all the above decisions together. In other words, using the market system has the same outcome as choosing the individual utility maximisation and cost minimisation plans.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; This is an important result when put into a macro level perspective because it implies that there exists a set of prices for inputs and outputs in the economy such that the profit-maximising behaviour of firms along with the utility-maximizing actions of individuals results in the demand for each good equaling the supply in all markets. This means that a
competitive equilibrium can exist. The merit of a competitive equilibrium is that an efficient allocation of resources is achievable.&lt;ref name="HRV"/&gt; In other words, no economic agent can be made better off without making another economic agent worse off.&lt;ref name="vijay"/&gt;

==Production possibilities with two goods==
{{Main|Production-possibility frontier}}
Let's assume that there is another commodity that Crusoe can produce apart from coconuts, for example, fish. Now, Robinson has to decide how much time to spare for both activities, i.e. how many coconuts to gather and how many fish to hunt.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; The locus of the various combinations of fish and coconuts that he can produce from devoting different amounts of time to each activity is known as the production possibilities set.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; This is depicted in the figure 6:

[[File:Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy with two commodities.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=Production possibilities with two goods|Figure 6: Production possibilities set in the Robinson Crusoe economy with two commodities.]]

The boundary of the production possibilities set is known as the Production-possibility frontier (PPF).&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; This curve measures the feasible outputs that Crusoe can produce, with a fixed technological constraint and given amount of resources. In this case, the resources and technological constraints are Robinson Crusoe's labour.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

It is crucial to note that the shape of the PPF depends on the nature of the technology in use.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; Here, technology refers to the type of [[returns to scale]] prevalent. In figure 6, the underlying assumption is the usual decreasing returns to scale, due to which the PPF is concave to the origin. In case we assumed increasing returns to scale, say if Crusoe embarked upon a mass production movement and hence faced decreasing costs, the PPF would be convex to the origin. The PPF is linear with a downward slope in two circumstances:
# If the technology for gathering coconuts and hunting fish exhibits constant returns to scale
# If there is only one input in production

So in the Robinson Crusoe economy, the PPF will be linear due to the presence of only one input.

===Marginal rate of transformation===
{{Main|Marginal rate of transformation}}
Suppose that Crusoe can produce 4 pounds of fish or 8 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he devotes L&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; hours to fish gathering and L&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; hours to gathering coconuts, he will produce 4L&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of fish and 8L&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of coconuts. Suppose that he decides to work for 12 hours a day. Then the production possibilities set will consist of all combinations of fish, F, and coconuts, C, such that

&lt;math&gt;F=4L_f \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=8L_c \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_f + L_c=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Solve the first two equations and substitute in the third to get,

&lt;math&gt;F/4 + C/8=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation represents Crusoe's PPF. The slope of this PPF measures the [[Marginal rate of transformation]] (MRT), i.e., how much of the first good must be given up in order to increase the production of the second good by one unit. If Crusoe works one hour less on hunting fish, he will have 4 less fish. If he devotes this extra hour to collecting coconuts, he will have 8 extra coconuts. The MRT is thus,

'''MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;'''
&lt;math&gt;={\Delta C \over{\Delta F}} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;= -8/4=-2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Comparative advantage===
{{Main|Comparative advantage}}
Under this section, the possibility of trade is introduced by adding another person to the economy. Suppose that the new worker who is added to the Robinson Crusoe Economy has different skills in gathering coconuts and hunting fish.&lt;ref name="JADM" /&gt; The second person is called "Friday".

Friday can produce 8 pounds of fish or 4 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he too decides to work for 12 hours, his production possibilities set will be determined by the following relations:

&lt;math&gt;F=8L_f \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=4L_c \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_f + L_c=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=&gt;F/8 + C/4=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,''' MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''' 
&lt;math&gt;={\Delta C \over{\Delta F}} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;= -4/8=-1/2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This means that for every pound of coconuts Friday gives up, he can produce 2 more pounds of fish.

So, we can say that Friday has a Comparative advantage &lt;ref name="JADM" /&gt; in hunting fish while Crusoe has a comparative advantage in gathering coconuts. Their respective PPFs can be shown in the following diagram:

[[File:Joint production possibilities in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|550px|500px|alt=Comparative Advantage||Figure 7: Joint production possibilities in the Robinson Crusoe economy.]]

The joint production possibilities set at the extreme right shows the total amount of both commodities that can be produced by Crusoe and Friday together. It combines the best of both workers.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; If both of them work to gather coconuts only, the economy will have 144 coconuts in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday. (This can be obtained by setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here the slope of the joint PPF is -1/2.

If we want more fish, we should shift that person who has a comparative advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, the slope of the joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

==Pareto efficiency==
{{Main|Pareto efficiency}}
Assume that there are '''''c''''' units of coconut and '''''f''''' units of fish available for consumption in the Crusoe Friday economy. Given this endowment bundle '''''(c,f)''''', the Pareto efficient bundle can be determined at the mutual tangency of Crusoe's and Friday's indifference curves in the [[Edgeworth box]] along the Pareto Set ([[Contract curve]]). These are the bundles at which Crusoe's and Friday's [[Marginal rate of substitution]] are equal.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;
In a simple exchange economy, the contract curve describes the set of bundles that exhaust the gains from trade. But in a Robinson Crusoe/Friday economy, there is another way to exchange goods – to produce less of one good and more of the other.&lt;ref name="RMS"/&gt;

[[File:Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy and the Edgeworth Box.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 8: Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy and the Edgeworth Box showing a Pareto Efficient situation within]]

From the figure 8, it is clear that an economy operating at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be [[Pareto efficient]]. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, there is a way to make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

Thus for Pareto Efficiency,

'''''MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = '''''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &lt;ref name="CD"/&gt;

(''for both Crusoe and Friday'')

This can be achieved in a competitive market by decentralising production and consumption decisions, i.e. Crusoe and Friday will both solve their own problems of how much to consume and produce independently.&lt;ref name="TN"/&gt;

'''Small and medium enterprises in Mexico''' generally called PYMEs ({{lang-es|pequeña y mediana empresa}}), are an important segment of the [[Economy of Mexico|Mexican economy]]. They are classified in two types of [[small and medium enterprises]]: family businesses and non-family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicoemprende.org.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=67|title= PyMEs |author= Mexico Emprende | year=2009|publisher=Mexico Emprende|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=October 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mexican Government]] supports PyMEs since 2004. The Mexican Chamber of Economy with the help of the Mexican government creates different type of programs for the PyMEs that need to improve their participation in the national market and also for the international market. The PyMEs' size is classified by the number of employees they have. The main sectors are manufacturing, commerce and service.

== PyMEs in Mexico ==
As of 2006 there were about 4 million enterprises in Mexico. Out of those 4 million, 99.8% were small and medium enterprises. About 52% of the Mexican [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] is generated by small and medium size enterprises. While the remaining 48% relies on large enterprises. Small and medium size enterprises contribute with the 72% of the formal employment in Mexico. PyMEs are subdivided into: 15% for Micro, 14.5% for small and 22.5% for medium enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.gob.mx |title=semana nacional de PyMEs |author= |date=  |publisher=Government |location= Mexico|language= Spanish |trans-title=national week of small and medium size enterprises in Mexico |accessdate=&lt;!-- (date you last opened the site) --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PyMes can be classified by type and size. There is a manufacturing, commerce, and service type. Within these, PyMEs are classified according to the number of employees—10, 50, 250 and more than 250 respectively—into micro, small, medium, and large enterprises. Service enterprises are classed by those with have 10, 50, 100, and more than 100 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.gob.mx |title=semana nacional de PyMEs |author= |date=  |publisher= |location=&lt;!-- (of publish, if any) --&gt; |language=Spanish |trans-title=national week for small and medium size enterprises |accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PyMEs throughout the nation are distributed by region. About 38% of them in the central part of the country, 17% locate southwest, 6% southeast, 12% northeast and 27% center-west.

There are two types of PyMEs in [[Mexico]] (according to their origin). Those that began as family businesses and those formed by more formal partnership. The ones that start as family business are small and only very few of them have some type of projection abroad. These are usually the ones who search for government support mainly for financial and training purposes. The other type of small and Medium size enterprises in Mexico are those who follow an established path. An example of this could be franchises, these do not have a problem of expanding abroad. Franchises are small projection of big enterprises who have already done the market research before entering a new zone. They have all the possible experience on expanding overseas and very little risk on failing because in most cases they go under the concept of a high brand awareness.

PyMEs have been an important part of the country's development, especially in the area of exports. Due to their small size they are versatile, dynamic and have growth potential. This potential also includes entering international markets. They are a major source of job creation in the country and are the most likely to implement new technologies. Since many are located in different regions of the country, they foment local development. The main contribution to enterprises growth lies on PyMEs. The importance of small and medium size enterprises in Mexico has grown through time due to the positive effect these businesses have had on Mexico's economy. Since these enterprises continue becoming more important, government is focusing a lot on supporting them.

On the other hand, they also have some disadvantages. In general PyMEs have not development the habit of reinvesting to improve production or reinvest in equipment. They do not have enough economic resources to hire specialized employees nor to train current ones. This and lack of foresight can lead to insufficient sales, lack of competitiveness, inadequate customer service, low quality and higher prices. Because of the lack of quality control, legal problems such as dealing with VATs and defective products becomes an issue.&lt;ref name="Que son las PyMEs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicoemprende.org.mx |title=que son las PyMEs? |author= |date=  |publisher=Mexican government |location=&lt;!-- (of publish, if any) --&gt; |language=Spanish |trans-title=|accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs for PyME developments ==
Since 2004, Mexican government has had a number of programs to support PyMEs so that they help Mexico's economy growth. The government has two groups of programs to support PyMEs.The first group helps PyMEs to grow within the national market. The main programs are Emerging Programs, Productive Projects, Centros Mexico Emprende (Mexico undertake program), National System of Loan Guaranties, and Enterprises Consultancy.&lt;ref name="Apoyo PyMEs"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/segmento.asp?Tema=3|title= Fondo de Apoyo para la Micro Pequeña y Mediana Empresa|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Support Fund for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises |accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective of the ''Programas Emergentes'' (Emerging Programs) is to help the economic areas that have been affected by natural disasters. This program achieves this objective through loans with special payment conditions. This help is given to the PyMEs that stop their economic activity because of a natural disaster. The Emerging Programs are coordinated and supervised by "Fondo PyMe." The regulations that this organization point out is that the PyMEs are supported with special resources with the concepts that the directive council determine that are essential to the economic reactivation of the enterprises. These enterprises have to satisfy certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Programas Emergentes"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=9|title= Programas Emergentes|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Emerging Programs|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Proyectos Productivos'' (Productive Projects) helps to finance investment projects that improve the competitiveness of PyMes. This helps to trigger the creation and maintenance of jobs and regional development. The most important project is the financing. These funds are mostly targeted to production projects. The projects have to help by developing, expansion and consolidation of the enterprises.&lt;ref name="Proyectos Productivos"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=12|title= Proyectos Productivos|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Productive Projects|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Centros Mexico Emprende'' (Mexico undertake program) is for the execution of public or private services to support PyMEs. The support is given in a comprehensive, accessible, lively, and timely way according to the size and the enterprises potential. The different types of center concepts are: fitting out and infrastructure, designing and updating information systems for planning, and measuring of results generated from the "Centros Mexico Emprende."&lt;ref name="Centros Mexico Emprende"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=15|title= Centros Mexico Emprende|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Mexico undertake project|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sistema Nacional de Garantias'' (National System of Loan Guaranties) provides PyMEs with easy access to the financing programs with competitive conditions and payment periods.&lt;ref name="Sistema Nacional de Garantias"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=8|title= Sistema Nacional de Garantias|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=National System of Guaranties|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Consultoria Empresarial'' (Enterprises Consultancy) is a program that helps PyMEs be more productive and profitable. It achieves this objective through the identification of business intervention programs. These programs are applied to one or more fundamental areas of an enterprise as training and consultancy and the development of instructors and consultants.&lt;ref name="Consultoria Empresarial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=22|title= Consultoria Empresarial|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Enterprises Consultancy|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs for existing PyMEs and international expansion ==
The second group helps PyMEs to maintain a place and to succeed in the international market. The SPyME (Subsecretaría para la Pequeña y Mediana Empresa) was created to promote, encourage, and design tools and programs with the purpose of creating, consolidating and developing micro, small, and medium enterprises in the international market.&lt;ref name="Economia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia/p_Contacto_PyME|title=Contacto PyME|location=Mexico City|language=Spanish|accessdate=October 14, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021111311/http://www.economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia/p_Contacto_PyME|archivedate=October 21, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sub-secretary for Small and Medium Enterprise (SPYME), with the purpose of helping primarily small enterprises, created the ''Programa Nacional de Capacitación y Consultoría'' (National Program for Training and Consultancy). This program incorporates improvement actions in areas where weaknesses or opportunities are detected. The program stimulates the consolidation of the entrepreneurship through actions like the instrumentation of innovative methodologies in productive priority sectors. The program also foments the application of strategic programs to improve enterprises management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.gob.mx |title=catalogo Mexicano de normas |author= |date= |publisher= |location=Mexico |language= Spanish |trans-title=catalog of Mexican rules|accessdate=October 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Program of Training and Consultancy (Programa Nacional de Capacitación y Consulta) divides its operation in four components. The ''Programa de Consultoría General'' (Program of General Consultancy), that was created for the projects of major demand identified by chambers and managerial associations, that as well as for state and municipal governments, will look for the support of the Fondo PyME (Fund SME). This program was made to take care of the needs of training and consultancy, across proven methodologies that assure they will have quantifiable results. The ''Programa Moderniza'' (Modernization Program), the Secretary of Economy (SE) and the Secretary of Tourism (SECTUR) started a System of Management named "Modernize" that allows to improve the quality of the services offered to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises of the tourist sector. The Secretary of Tourism carries out the consultants' formation, which are the only ones authorized to execute the program and to register in SECTUR. The ''Formación de Consultores PyME&amp;nbsp;– JICA'' (SME Consultants' Formation&amp;nbsp;– JICA) establishes the formation of advisers specialized in the methodology of the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA). The process is based on the application of Japanese tools of improvements of high impact with a lower cost. It lasts approximately one month and a half, and is directed to consultants with more than three years of experience in managerial consultancy. This has allowed relying on a base of specialized consultants that multiplies the efforts to offer specialized services of consultancy that generate more competitive enterprises. The ''Consultoría Empresarial PyME'' (SME Managerial Consultancy-JICA) estimulates the development and consolidation of the MIPyMES by the application of a model of integral attention of standardized consultancy, carried out by the consultants PYME-JICA and accredited by the Secretary of Economy. The process of consultancy that is offered in the facilities of the company lasts from 3 to 4 months, and is directed for MIPYMES, preferably with two years of operation. The Fondo PyME (Fund SME), along with the National Program of Consultancy PYME-JICA, helps with subsidies that go from 30 to 70 percent of the total cost of the service of managerial consultancy.

== PyMEs exports ==
It is proven that many economies are based on their exports. Well organized and structured PyMEs can be a significant source of exports. For this reason, the Mexican government is giving special attention to PyMEs in this regard, allocating a big part of its economic resources to help small and medium size enterprises expand overseas. Supported PyMEs can mean increasing exports and a more open economy.&lt;ref name="semanapyme"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.gob.mx |title=semana nacional de PyMEs |author= |date= |publisher=Government |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=national week of support for small and medium size enterprises |accessdate=November 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Subsecretaria para la pequena y mediana empresa" (SPyME) was founded to design, foment and promote programs and other tools that have as objective the creation, consolidation and development of micro, small and medium size enterprises.

About 59% of Mexico's exports are controlled by 30% of the total enterprises in the country. Out of all the PyMEs existing only 9% of them export, while the remaining 83% do not have any type of presence overseas. International Commerce in Mexico is mainly based on big enterprises, this is why government is very interested on giving assistance and financial help to small businesses.

Out of all the exporting enterprises in Mexico only 64,000 are PyMEs. They are located mostly in the center part of the country, northeast and centerwest.

There are many ways PyMEs can be supported in Mexico. Fiscal support to Mexican exporters. VAT return or VAT compensation. Program of foment for the manufacturing industry maquiladora and export services (IMMEX). Also through the program of sectorial promotion. Program of Drawback ( through which Government offers VAT return to those Mexican small businesses that export to a country that has imposed tariffs on imports). There are Benefits to High level exporting enterprises (ALTEX). Benefits to International commerce enterprises (ECEX). Mechanisms of Indirect Exports such as VAT elimination or Application of 0% VAT on exports. Mixed Commission for the Promotion of exports (COMPEX). An annual incentive named National Exporting Price. Government aid such as information or opportunities to expand overseas, consultancy and training. Commercial opportunities such as analysis of the market. Selection and establishment of contact with client within the foreign market. Government may also support PyMEs though a Positioning process.

The most important programs supporting for exports are Financing, Consultancy, Training, Exporting, Technical Assistance and Information on exports.&lt;ref name="Secretaria de Economia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia|title=secretaria de economia|author=|date=|publisher=|location=Mexico City|language=Spanish|trans-title=Secretary of Economy|accessdate=2010-10-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017230209/http://economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia|archivedate=2010-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Kimball Lifecycle''' is a methodology for developing [[data warehouse]]s, and has been developed by [[Ralph Kimball]] and a variety of colleagues.

== Program/Project planning ==
According to Kimball et al., this phase is the start of the lifecycle. It is a [[planning]] phase in which project is a single iteration of the lifecycle while program is the broader coordination of resources. When launching a project/program Kimball et al. suggests following three focus areas:
* Define and Scope project
* Plan project
* [[Project management]]

== Program/Project Management ==
This is an ongoing discipline in the project. The purpose is to keep the project/program on course, develop a communication plan and manage expectations.

== Business Requirements Definition ==
This phase/milestone of the project is about making the project team understand the [[business requirements]]. Its purpose is to establish a foundation for all the following activities in the lifecycle. Kimball et al. makes it clear that it is important for the project team to talk with the business users and be prepared to focus on listening and to document the interview. An output of this step is the [[Enterprise bus matrix]].

== Technology Track ==
The top track holds two milestones:

#'''Technical Architecture''' Design is supposed to create a framework for the DW/BI system. The main focus in this phase is to create a plan for the application architecture, while considering business requirements, technical environment and the planned strategic technical directions.
#'''Product Selection &amp; Installation''' use the architecture plan to identify what components are needed to complete the DW/BI project. This phase then selects, installs and tests the products.

== Data Track ==
'''Dimensional Modeling''' is a process in which the business requirements are used to design dimensional models for the system. 

'''Physical Design''' is the phase where the database is designed. It involves the database environment as well as security. 

'''ETL Design &amp; Development''' is the design of some of the heavy procedures in the DW/BI-system ([[Extract, Transform, Load]]). Kimball et al. suggests four parts to this process, which are further divided into 34 subsystems (Kimball et al., 2008):
* Extracting data
* Cleaning and conforming data
* Delivering data for Presentation
* Managing the ETL system

== Business Intelligence Application Track ==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
BI Application Design deals with designing and selecting some applications to support the business requirements. BI Application Development use the design to develop and validate applications to support the business requirements.

== Deployment ==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
When the three tracks are complete they all end up in the final deployment. This phase requires planning and should include pre-deployment testing, documentation, training and maintenance and support.

== Maintenance ==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
When the deployment has finished the system will need proper maintenance to stay alive. This includes data reconciliation, execution and monitoring and performance tuning.

== Growth ==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
As the project can be seen as part of the larger iterative program, it is likely that the system will want to expand. There will be projects to add new data as well as reaching new segments of the business areas. The lifecycle then starts over again.

'''Willie Revillame''' (born '''Wilfredo Buendia Revillame''', January 27, 1961) is a Filipino television host, singer, songwriter, businessman, actor and comedian.

==Life and career==
Revillame started out as the host of [[GMA Network]]'s noontime variety program ''[[Lunch Date]]'' in the early 1980s together with [[Randy Santiago]]. After his hosting stint he started appearing on different movies playing sidekick to big-named stars. In 1998, he started co-hosting the [[ABS-CBN]] noontime show "'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila". After the show was cancelled to make way for his big break in ''[[Magandang Tanghali Bayan]]'', he also started appearing in [[Richard Loves Lucy]]. Other shows he hosted within the network were "Willingly Yours", ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'', and ''[[Wowowee]]'', as well as [[Associated Broadcasting Company|TV5]] variety programs like ''[[Willing Willie]]'', ''[[Wil Time Bigtime]]'' and ''[[Wowowillie]]''.

On March 2015, Revillame marked his homecoming in [[GMA Network]] (his original home network), his long-awaited return to Philippine showbiz and to Philippine television via his newest weekly-variety program ''[[Wowowin]]'', airing on [[GMA Network]] every Sunday afternoon since May 10, 2015 until it became a weekday-variety program in February 2016 due to the huge popularity of the show.

==Business ventures==
Revillame is known for developing a business, the Wil Tower Mall near ABS-CBN Eugenio Lopez Drive in Quezon City with business partner [[Manny Villar]]. It held its grand opening on September 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/05/13/09/willies-mall-soon-rise-qc Wil Tower Mall]&lt;/ref&gt; Revillame is also a former owner of the restaurants W Bar and Wil Steak Town at Wil Events Place located near Wil Tower Mall and ABS-CBN along Sgt. Esguerra Avenue in South Triangle, Diliman, [[Quezon City]]. Wil Tower Mall was developed by the real estate firm Vista Land, but Revillame's holdings were sold to his business partner and friend, former Senator [[Manny Villar]].

Revillame was interviewed for the April 2015 episode of [[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho]] at his own rest house in [[Tagaytay|Tagaytay City]] after the signing of contract with [[GMA Network]]. During the interview, [[GMA Network|GMA 7]] broadcast journalist [[Jessica Soho]] said that Revillame is planning to build a 5-star resort-hotel located within the 5 hectare lot that he acquired from the Madrigal family. His own rest house is also located within the same lot.

==Personal life==
Revillame married Liz Almoro in a civil ceremony at Lipa, [[Batangas]] in March 2005, officiated by Mayor [[Vilma Santos]]. This was followed shortly by a church wedding in June 2005, their marriage annulled in 2008. Prior to his marriage to Almoro, Revillame was married to actress [[Princess Punzalan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/2536/Willie-Revillame-opens-up-about-the-women-in-his-life.aspx ABS-CBN.com - Willie Revillame Opens Up About the Women in His Life]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/181168/pep-princess-punzalan-is-happy-for-ex-husband-willie-revillames-success GMA News - PEP: Princess Punzalan Is Happy for Ex-Husband Willie Revillame's Success]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Undue weight|date=May 2013}}

On February 4, 2006, while Willie was hosting ''[[Wowowee]]'', the [[PhilSports Arena stampede]] occurred.

On August 25, 2007, the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] dismissed criminal charges against Revillame in connection with the stampede. However, [[Secretary of Justice (Philippines)|Justice Secretary]] [[Raul M. Gonzalez]] affirmed the charge against 14 others, including [[ABS-CBN]] officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/57523/(Update)-DOJ-drops-raps-vs-Revillame-over-Ultra-tragedy GMA NEWS.TV, DOJ drops raps vs Revillame over Ultra tragedy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 3, 2009 episode of ''Wowowee'', during which the show was interrupted for live coverage of the transfer of President [[Cory Aquino]]'s remains from La Salle Greenhills to the [[Manila Cathedral]],  Revillame said that he could not make people happy while the entire country was mourning. The Alliance of Filipino Journalists denounced his remarks as a sign of disrespect towards Aquino. Revillame said he had no intention of defaming the former president and her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/22736/Criticisms-mount-against-%20Wowowee-%20host-Willie-Revillame|title=Criticisms mount against Wowowee host Willie Revillame - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|publisher=PEP.ph}} Retrieved on 2011-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; ABS-CBN senior executive [[Cory Vidanes]] said the network supported Revillame's action, stating that his outburst did not run afoul of the Broadcast Code of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/22858/abs-cbn?backs-willie-revillame-says-wowowee-host-did-not-violate-broadcast-code-of-the-philippines|title=ABS-CBN backs Willie Revillame; says Wowowee host did not violate Broadcast Code of the Philippines|publisher=PEP.ph|date=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network entertainment official [[Johnny Manahan]] said Revillame was correct in saying that the footage should not have been inserted, but the way he said it was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pep.ph/news/22768/%20PEP-EXCLUSIVE:%20-Johnny-Manahan%20speaks-up-for%20Willie-Revillame&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2010, Revillame went into another on-air tirade on his now-defunct noontime show "Wowowee", this time directing his anger at entertainment columnist and DZMM Radio host Jobert Sucaldito. Without mentioning him by name, he said he had enough of Sucaldito's alleged criticisms against the show having high-school contestants whose grades were below the passing mark for the Willie of Fortune segment and also ridiculing them on-screen. He threatened to resign from the show unless the ABS-CBN management dismissed Sucaldito, who described Revillame's rant as being "pikon" (Tagalog slang meaning 'touchy').&lt;ref&gt;http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20100506-268474/Willie-Revillame-threatens-to-resign-from-TVs-Wowowee&lt;/ref&gt; He went on an indefinite leave three weeks later after the network declined his resignation letter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/05/25/10/willie-revillame-takes-indefinite-break-wowowee&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference on August 9, 2010, Revillame announced that he was ending his contract with ABS-CBN, even if it is supposed to expire in September 2011. He also accused ABS-CBN of violating several provisions in his contract. He narrated that his decision came out of meetings between ABS-CBN production head Linggit Tan and network president Charo Santos-Concio regarding a return to the show on July 31. However, on July 20, Tan said the management will replace ''Wowowee'' with a [[Pilipinas Win na Win|new show]] on July 31 and also offered him a one-hour weekly show. She added negative feedback still prevailed among network employees about him going to work again. Despite the move, the network stated that Revillame's Wowowee tirade only highlighted his arrogance and stressed that the contract is still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/271538/willie-revillame-rescinds-contract-with-abscbn&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2011, a "macho dance" by an apparently unhappy six-year-old boy on Revillame's primetime show, ''Willing Willie'', resulted in criticism, including the [[Department of Social Welfare and Development (Philippines)|Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development]] describing it as a case of child abuse. Revillame "sincerely and deeply" apologized for the segment, “which viewers may have found offensive or in bad taste.”&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnation.inquirer.net/columns/columns/view/20110325-327581/Willing-Willie-and-the-boy-who-wouldnt-smile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/03/28/11/boy-abused-%E2%80%98willing-willie%E2%80%99-dswd-says&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanews.tv/story/216365/entertainment/dswd-calls-for-censure-of-willie-for-boy-macho-dancer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/311671/revillame-s-hit-a-minor-causes-stir-cyberspace&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]] pursued an investigation of the program for violating the law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/03/29/11/chr-investigate-jan-jan-case&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals]] allowed the arrest and prosecution of Revillame over the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torres-Tupas|first1=Tetch|title=Willie Revillame ordered arrested over child abuse case|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/181276/willie-revillame-ordered-arrested-over-child-abuse-case|accessdate=October 18, 2015|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atty. Nards de Vera, lawyer of Revillame, clarified in a [[GMA News]] article that Revillame has already posted the bail for the two cases in September 2013, and does not need the warrant of arrest served against his client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/541138/news/metro/lawyer-on-ca-order-no-need-to-arrest-willie-he-already-posted-bail|title=Lawyer on CA order: No need to arrest Willie, he already posted bail | publisher = GMA News | accessdate = October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On April 11, 2016, the 3rd division of the Court of Appeal (CA) had affirmed the Regional Trial Court Quezon City Judge Roberto Buenaventura Decision. The CA said that Judge Buenaventura hadn't committed no grave abuse of discretion. In the CA's Decision, written by Justice Maria Luisa Quijano-Padilla, on the arrest and to bring to trial Willie Revillame,  they said, " “as there is probable cause for the petitioner’s commission of a crime, his arrest and arraignment should now ensue so that this case may properly proceed to trial, where the merits of both parties’ evidence and allegations may be weighed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/194011/court-denies-revillame-plea-abuse-case | publisher = Philippine Daily Inquirer | title= Court denies Revillame plea in abuse case | accessdate = April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
