The '''2004 Christmas Eve United States winter storm''' was a rare [[weather]] event that took place in [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]] in the United States on December 24, 2004, before the storm moved northeast to affect the coastal sections of the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] and [[New England]] in the succeeding few days. This was a [[pre-Christmas 2004 snowstorm|different storm from the historic event]] that struck the Midwest and southern Canada around December 23 from another cyclone which preceded this storm. The event involved a thin band of [[snow]]fall with unusually cold temperatures for the middle Texas coast, and caused dozens of varied weather records to be shattered. It was the most significant snow for the Texas Gulf Coast, and deep South Texas, since February 1895.

==Anticipation of the event==
There had been indications for up to a week before the event that a frontal wave in the Gulf of Mexico was expected to track far enough to the south (along roughly the [[26th parallel north|26th parallel]]) to lead to snow along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coastline of the United States.

==Synoptic history==
A surface cyclone formed in the western [[Gulf of Mexico]] on December 24 and December 28 due to a shortwave aloft, and moved eastward through the western Gulf of Mexico, bringing banded snowfall to the middle Texas coast. The [[extratropical cyclone]] moved east, then northeast, tracking across the northern peninsula of Florida early on December 26 before moving about &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;100&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(200&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; offshore the Southeast, paralleling the coast.  Continuing to deepen, the developing storm moved about &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;200&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(300&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, [[New England]], and [[Atlantic Canada]] on December 27 before moving out to sea.

==Effects==
[[Image:South Texas 12-25-04.jpg|thumb|right|254px|Christmas Day in Deep South Texas]]

===Texas and Louisiana===
The most noticeable, and unusual, event associated with the storm was the snowfall it produced. Much of the snow fell in southern Texas, along the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], but some snow, albeit less deep, fell across southwestern and southeastern [[Louisiana]]. Any snowfall in these areas is extremely unusual, perhaps occurring once every twenty years, and these events are usually airborne flurries which melt on contact with the ground. In many places the snow stuck to the ground and accumulated to an appreciable depth. In [[Brownsville, Texas]], snow fell to a depth of {{convert|1.5|in|cm}}, the first measurable snowfall at the city in years, since the [[Great Blizzard of 1899]].

[[Image:HoustonTX TrinityChurchInSnow.jpg|thumb|254px|right|[[Trinity Church, Houston|Trinity Church]] in Houston Christmas Eve 2004]]
The fact that the snow accumulated overnight on [[Christmas Eve]] led to a [[White Christmas (weather)|White Christmas]] the next morning, something completely foreign to the region. Across all of southern Texas and in southwestern Louisiana, snow fell in places where it had not for anywhere from 15 to 120 years. Near the coast, in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], {{convert|5.2|in|cm}} of snow fell, more snow than in all previous recorded years combined. This was also the case in [[Victoria, Texas]], where a significant {{convert|13.0|in|cm}} fell. [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] had its first white Christmas in 50 years. In addition to the unusual occurrence of snow inland, moderate to heavy snow was also reported over the open waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This is the first significant snow fall in Houston since February 12, 1960, when a snowstorm hit central and south Texas with eight to 10&amp;nbsp;inches of snow.

'''Asalouyeh''' ({{lang-fa|عسلويه}}, also [[Romanized]] as '''‘Asalūyeh'''; also known as '''Asalu''', and sometimes prefixed by '''bandar''', meaning port)&lt;ref&gt;{{GEOnet3|-3053811}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a city and capital of [[Asaluyeh County]], in [[Bushehr Province]], [[Iran]].  At the 2006 census, its population was 4,746, in 875 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{IranCensus2006|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate spellings include: Assalouyeh, Asalouyeh, Asalouyeh, Asaluyeh, Asaloyeh, Asalooyeh, Asaluye, Assaluyeh, Asalu. 
UNCTAD codes: IR YEH, IR PGU, IR ASA.

Located on the shore of the [[Persian Gulf]] some 270&amp;nbsp;km SE of the provincial capital of [[Bushehr]], it is best known as the site for the land based facilities of the huge PSEEZ ([[Pars Special Energy Economic Zone]]) project. The town itself is of minor significance, although it is common practice to refer to PSEEZ (established 1998) and Asaluyeh town collectively as Asaluyeh.

Asalouyeh was chosen as the site of the PSEEZ facilities due to it being the closest land point to the largest [[natural gas field]] in the world, the [[South Pars / North Dome Gas-Condensate field#South Pars|South Pars / North Dome Gas-Condensate field]]. In addition, an existing airport and direct access to international waters via a deep water port were already present.&lt;ref name=location&gt;[http://www.iranasalouyeh.com/page.php?where-en Location]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} iranasalouyeh.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==PSEEZ==
{{See also|National Petrochemical Company#Special industrial economic zones|l1=National Petrochemical Company and Special Economic Zones in Iran}}
[http://www.pseez.com/ The PSEEZ (Pars Special Energy/Economic Zone)] as it is known has been allocated 100 square kilometres of land at Asaluyeh for the various complexes and facilities. The site is a collection of different plants and [[refineries]] (known as "phases") and is administered by the [http://www.parspc.net PSEEZ agency onsite].

A total of 27 phases are envisaged (12 gas, 15 [[petrochemical]]), plus a mix of light and heavy industry, and associated support facilities such as factories and warehouses. The scale of the project is huge. Some 28 refineries and 25 petrochemical complexes are scheduled to be established in Asalouyeh, in southern [[Bushehr]] province. Of these, 10 refineries and 7 petrochemical complexes were already operational in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iran-daily.com/1388/3463/html/economy.htm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PSEEZ is a workers town - tourism is non-existent. Currently there are no hotels in Assalouyeh, although plans exist to construct a hotel between the airport and the Industrial area. Once completed, the Sadaf International Hotel will consist of 400 rooms in three buildings, on 1 square kilometre of land. A [[Visa (document)|visa]] is required to enter Iran for most nationalities, and is therefore needed to visit the PSEEZ. The only exception to the visa requirement is if you visit [[Kish Island]], which allows visitors to enter visa-free.

As of August 2005, US$20 billion of foreign money had been invested in PSEEZ since 1997. According to [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Iran's oil ministry]], sales of products from PSEEZ could be as much as $11 billion per year, over 30 years.

Private companies are also constructing a [[office park|business park]] and [[warehouses]].

[[Communications in Iran|Internet access and telephony facilities]] are also available via a [[Tehran]] based [[Internet Service Provider]], [[Pars Online]]. No other ISP's are present at PSEEZ.
In 2010, a large [[List of power stations in Iran|power plant]] with 1,000 megawatts output was inaugurated in Asalouyeh, aiming to supply electricity to the refineries of [[South Pars]] gas field phases 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, and 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/jun/1138.html|title=South Pars attracts $15b in domestic investment|author=|date=|website=www.payvand.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special economic zone===

{{See also|Foreign Direct Investment in Iran#Free Trade Zones and Special Economic Zones|l1=Foreign Direct Investment and Special Economic Zones in Iran}}

The Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) is a [[special economic zone]]. PSEEZ was established in 1998 for the utilization of [[South Pars]] oil and gas resources. Goods can be brought in duty-free, but cannot leave the PSEEZ and enter the rest of Iran. This is to encourage construction within and development of the PSEEZ. The private sector has invested some $1.5 billion in the PSEEZ during the past 4 years (2009). Foreign entities have invested some $36 billion in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) during the past 10 years (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/jan/1224.html|title=Iran's PSEEZ absorbs $36B foreign investment in a decade|author=|date=|website=www.payvand.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asalouyeh City==
{{see also|Geography of Iran}}
Asalouyeh city is surrounded by PSEEZ, but is still geographically separate and a few minutes drive from the nearest PSEEZ facility. Before the arrival of PSEEZ, the primary industry was fishing, albeit a very small one. Asalouyeh was a sleepy coastal hamlet, on a narrow strip of land between the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Zagros Mountains]]. Poverty existed in the small town, and it remains. Today it is the most knows akak shops.{{clarify|date=May 2014}} In 2006 part of the town's seafront was given a promenade with some landscaping and decoration.

==Construction==
{{see also|Construction in Iran}}
The PSEEZ is one of the busiest ongoing construction sites in the world. At any one time up to 60,000 workers are onsite, mostly employed in construction of further gas and petrochemical refineries.

==Airport==
{{See also|Asalouyeh Airport|Transport in Iran}}
Construction of a new airport began in 2003. The new '''Persian Gulf International Airport''' ([[IATA]] code: '''YEH''') opened to traffic in July 2006, replacing the original temporary airport. The volume of construction works for facilities such as runways and aircraft parking area, fence, and patrol roads and access routes to the airport's boulevard, construction of terminals with Jetways to handle 750,000 passengers per year. Control tower and technical buildings as well as supporting buildings such as fire station, meteorology section and so on have been started. Airport characteristics are the runway with length of 4000 meters asphalt paved, width of 45 meters with two 7.5m shoulders along the runway. Aircraft parking area is 330 × 150 Sqm concrete paved. Airport area and peripheral buildings will be constructed on 18 hectares of land. Iranian specialists are undertaking execution works for this airport and installation of the airport's navigation and lighting systems will be performed by foreign companies.

==Pars-Port Complex==
{{See also|Transport in Iran}}
'''Logistic Port:''' 
Logistic port covers 150 hectares: The western breakwater is 2300 meters long and the eastern breakwater is 1000 meters long. The port basin is 100 hectares with capacity to accept ships of up to 80,000 tons deadweight. The nominal capacity of this port is 10 million tons per year including 1 million tons of granulated sulphur, 3 million of container products and 6 million tons of refinery machinery and parts. 
This port will have at least 10 berths that can simultaneously accommodate 10 ships and especially for exporting of sulphur, containers loading / unloading as heavy cargo. Water drought along the berths is at least 11 meters and at most 15 meters and the jetty in this port is 2600 meters long. 
At present, 5 berths are operational. All of the equipment needed by refineries and petrochemical industries were unloaded in this very port and installed on sites.&lt;br /&gt;  
'''Petrochemical Port:'''  
The petrochemical port with 15 berths and draught of 15 meters can accommodate ships of capacity 80,000 tons deadweight that especially carry gas and petrochemical products. The nominal capacity of this port is 35 million tons per year and it is predicted that 26 million tons of petrochemical products in liquid from will be exported through this port.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iran-daily.com/1389/4/29/MainPaper/3731/Page/4/Index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
In accordance with the operations time schedule for the Zone's petrochemical projects, execution operations on this port will be completed in three phases; phase 1 will be completed by 2005 and the project's completion date will be year 2006.

Any visitor to Asaluyeh will immediately notice the series of Gas and Petrochemical complexes running along the coast, one of the largest collection of such facilities in the world. The various plants and complexes currently run for some 12&amp;nbsp;km, and more are being constructed. A series of [[gas flare]]s which line the facility are immediately obvious, including one enormous flare in particular, with flames of almost 100 m in height. This flare is visible far out to sea. The area also hosts the world's largest [[aromatic]] production plant, [[National Iranian Petrochemical Company#NIPC affiliate companies|Noori Petrochemical Complex]], with an annual capacity of 4.2 million tons. Once completed, South Pars development revenue will exceed [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)#Revenues from crude oil|current oil exports incomes]].&lt;ref name="Shana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shana.ir/154657-en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224152809/http://www.shana.ir/154657-en.html |archivedate=24 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas production at South Pars rose by nearly 30 per cent between March 2009 and March 2010. The field's reserves are estimated at 14 trillion cubic meters of gas and {{convert|18|Goilbbl|m3}} of gas condensates. Production at South Pars gas field will rise to 175 million cubic meters per day in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/156997.html|title=PressTV|author=|date=|website=www.presstv.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Pars Gas Field==
{{main|South Pars / North Dome Gas-Condensate field}}
{{see also|National Iranian Gas Company}}

The field is located in the [[Persian Gulf]].

The field is the biggest gas field in the world, shared between Iran and Qatar, which contains {{convert|1800000000000000|cuft|km3|sigfig=2}} gas in place and {{convert|56|Goilbbl|m3}} of condensate in place in both parts.

The South Pars Field is the name of northern part, which is located in Iranian waters and the North Dome is the name of southern part, which is located in Qatari waters. South Pars Field was discovered in 1990 by NIOC.

Production started from the southern extension of the field, the North Dome in 1989, at daily gas production rate of 800 mmscf/d.

Gas production started from South Pars field by commissioning the development phase 2 in December 2002 to produce 1 bscf/d of wet gas.

The field consists of two independent gas-bearing formations, Kangan and Upper Dalan. Each formation is divided into two different reservoir layers, separated by impermeable barriers. Therefore, the field consists of four independent reservoir layers K1, K2, K3, and K4.

Iranian sections contains {{convert|500000000000000|cuft|km3|sigfig=2}} of gas in place and around {{convert|360000000000000|cuft|km3|sigfig=2}} of recoverable gas. It covers an area of {{convert|500|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} and is located 3&amp;nbsp;km below the seabed at a water depth of 65 m. The Iranian side accounts for 10% of the world's and 60% of Iran's total gas reserves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/southpars/&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is planned to be developed in around 30 phases, each of which will require an initial investment of around $1bn.

==Downstream Industries==
{{see also|National Iranian Petrochemical Company}}
Due to the availability of Petrochemicals and their by-products, 10 square kilometres at PSEEZ has been allocated for related industries, such as:&lt;ref name=industries&gt;[http://www.iranasalouyeh.com/page.php?project-en www.iranasalouyeh.com]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water supply project==
{{See also|Water supply and sanitation in Iran}}
Construction of two water desalination plants each with a capacity of 10,000 cubic per day started in March 2005. The project was finished 10 months ahead of its contractual 16 months estimate, making it a landmark in project execution in the region.  
The creation of a network for transferring water distribution network in different sites is underway.

==Green space and environment==
{{see also|Environmental issues in Iran}}
In view of the Zone's policy on environmental protection and alleviation of industrial pollutions, first steps have been taken in the form of 1000 hectares of urban green space and 3000 hectares allocated to forestation and expansion of the mangrove trees in the tidal area of the sea. In this way, 10% of the total industrial site and 28% of the entire Zone will be transformed into green space.

==Foreign involvement==
{{main|Foreign Direct Investment in Iran}}
Individual gas and petrochemical plants at Asoluyeh, when constructed, usually involve a partnership with a foreign company. The [[Government of Iran|government]] of [[President Ahmadinejad]], who came to power in 2005, has favoured [[National Iranian Oil Company#NIOC's major domestic contractors|local firms]] over foreign companies in the energy and other sectors.&lt;ref name="Iran" /&gt; Due to the [[U.S. sanctions against Iran|embargo in place against Iran]] by the United States, it is mostly European and Asian companies becoming involved.

These include:
* [[China National Petroleum Corporation]]
* [[Daelim]]
* [[Eni]] (formerly known as Agip)
* [[Gazprom]]
* Hyundai Engineering and Construction (with [[The Linde Group|Linde]] Group)&lt;ref name=Hyundai&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20050705074258|title=Iran: Hyundai in Asalouyeh Gas Plant Contract|author=|date=|website=zawya.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Japan Gasoline Company (JGC) - involved in the construction of the world's largest gas refinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/03/may/1062.html|title=World's largest gas refinery to be built in Iran's Assalouyeh|author=|date=|website=www.payvand.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Petronas]]
* [[Statoil]]
* [[Technip]]
* [[Total S.A.|Total]]
* [[Toyo Engineering Corporation]] (TEC)

However, the US company [[Halliburton]] and [[American Allied International Corporation]], have contracts for and business dealing with South Pars via subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaic.cc/contact.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040618163323/http://www.aaic.cc/contact.php |archivedate=18 June 2004 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for LNG refining and export have been discussed - but it remains to be seen how this will be accomplished, as most LNG refining technology is US based and therefore subject to export control due to [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|US sanctions]].

'''Computational anatomy (CA)''' is a discipline within [[medical imaging]]  focusing on the study of anatomical shape and form at the visible or [[Gross anatomy|gross anatomical]] scale of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. 
The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[anatomy]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[pure mathematics]], including [[medical imaging]], [[neuroscience]], [[physics]], [[probability]], and [[statistics]]. It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. 
The central focus of the sub-field of [[computational anatomy]] within [[medical imaging]] is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems most often dense information measured within a [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance image]] (MRI). The introduction of flows into CA, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian]] equations of motion. In models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.  The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== The main statistical model==

[[File:Source-channel-model-Shannon.png|thumb|Source-channel model showing the source of images the deformable template &lt;math&gt;I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_\mathrm{temp} \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; and channel output associated with MRI sensor &lt;math&gt;I^D \in \mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{D}}&lt;/math&gt;]]
The central statistical model of Computational Anatomy in the context of [[medical imaging]] has been the source-channel model of [[Shannon theory]]; the source is the deformable template of images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal {I} &lt;/math&gt;, the channel outputs are the imaging sensors with observables &lt;math&gt; I^D \in {\mathcal I}^{\mathcal D} &lt;/math&gt; (see Figure). The importance of the source-channel model is that the variation in the anatomical configuration are modelled separated from the sensor variations of the Medical imagery. The [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes theory]] dictates that the model is characterized by the prior on the source, &lt;math&gt; \pi_{\mathcal{I}} (\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;, and the conditional density on the observable

: &lt;math&gt; p(\cdot \mid I) \text{ on } I^D \in {\mathcal I}^{\mathcal D} &lt;/math&gt;

conditioned on &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;.

In deformable template theory, the images are linked to the templates, with the deformations a group which acts on the template;
see [[Group actions in computational anatomy|group action in computational anatomy]]
For image action &lt;math&gt;I(g) \doteq g \cdot I_\mathrm{temp}, g \in \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;,  then the prior on the group &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\mathcal{G}} (\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; induces the prior on images &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\mathcal{I}} (\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, written as densities the log-posterior takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\log p(I(g)\mid I^D) \simeq \log p(I^D \mid I(g))+ \log \pi_{\mathcal{G}}(g).
&lt;/math&gt;

The random orbit model which follows specifies how to generate the group elements and therefore the random spray of objects which form the prior distribution.

For the study of deformable shape in CA, the high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups used in computational anatomy are generated via smooth flows &lt;math&gt; \varphi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow fields satisfying the ordinary differential equation: [[File:Lagrangian flow.png|thumb|Showing the Lagrangian flow of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; with associated vector fields &lt;math&gt;v_t, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; satisfying ordinary differential equation &lt;math&gt;\dot \varphi_t = v_t(\varphi_t), \varphi_0=id&lt;/math&gt;.]]

with &lt;math&gt; v \doteq (v_1,v_2,v_3) &lt;/math&gt; the vector fields on &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt; termed the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Eulerian]] velocity of the particles at position &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of the flow. The vector fields are functions in a function space, modelled as a smooth [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] space with the vector fields having 1-continuous derivative . For &lt;math&gt;v_t = \dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1}, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, the inverse of the flow is given by

The integral is calculated by integration by parts when &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function  in the dual space &lt;math&gt; V^*&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Riemannian exponential ===

{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}
In the [[Computational anatomy|random orbit model of computational anatomy]], the entire flow is reduced to the initial condition which forms the coordinates encoding the diffeomorphism. From the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; then geodesic positioning  with respect to the [[Computational anatomy#Diffeomorphometry and the metric space of shapes and forms|Riemannian metric]] of Computational anatomy solves for the flow of the Euler-Lagrange equation.
Solving the geodesic from the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; is termed the '''Riemannian-exponential,''' a mapping &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(\cdot): V \to \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; at identity to the group.

The Riemannian exponential satisfies &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id} (v_0)= \varphi_1 &lt;/math&gt; for initial condition &lt;math&gt;\dot \varphi_0 = v_0&lt;/math&gt;, vector field dynamics &lt;math&gt;\dot \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t, t \in [0,1]
&lt;/math&gt;,
* for classical equation diffeomorphic shape momentum &lt;math&gt;  \int_X Av_t \cdot w \, dx &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Av \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then

:: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} Av_t +  (Dv_t)^T Av_t +(DAv_t)v_t + ( \nabla \cdot v) Av_t =0  \ ;
&lt;/math&gt;
* for generalized equation, then &lt;math&gt;
Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; w \in V &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \int_X \frac{d}{dt} Av_t \cdot w dx + \int_X Av_t \cdot ((Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t)dx =0 . &lt;/math&gt;
It is extended to the entire group, &lt;math&gt;
\varphi= \mathrm{Exp}_\varphi(v_0\circ \varphi) \doteq \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id} (v_0) \circ \varphi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Depicted in the accompanying figure is a depiction of the random orbits around each exemplar, &lt;math&gt;m_0 \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, generated by randomizing the flow by generating the initial tangent space vector field at the identity &lt;math&gt;v_0 \in V&lt;/math&gt;, and then generating random object &lt;math&gt;n \doteq Exp_{id}(v_0) \cdot m_0 \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

Shown in the Figure on the right the cartoon orbit, are a random spray of the subcortical manifolds generated by randomizing the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; supported over the submanifolds.The random orbit model induces the prior on shapes and images &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; conditioned on a particular atlas &lt;math&gt;
I_a \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;. For this the generative model generates the mean field &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; as a random change in coordinates of the template according to &lt;math&gt;
I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_a &lt;/math&gt;, where the diffeomorphic change in coordinates is generated randomly via the geodesic flows.

==MAP estimation in the multiple-atlas orbit model==
The random orbit model induces the prior on shapes and images &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; conditioned on a particular atlas &lt;math&gt; I_a \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;. For this the generative model generates the mean field &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; as a random change in coordinates of the template according to &lt;math&gt;I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_a 
&lt;/math&gt;, where the diffeomorphic change in coordinates is generated randomly via the geodesic flows. The prior on random transformations &lt;math&gt;\pi_\mathrm{Diff} (d\varphi) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; is induced by the flow &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;
v \in V &lt;/math&gt; constructed as a Gaussian random field prior &lt;math&gt; \pi_V(dv) &lt;/math&gt;. The density on the random observables at the output of the sensor &lt;math&gt;I^D \in \mathcal{I}^D&lt;/math&gt; are given by

: &lt;math&gt;
p(I^D\mid I_a) = \int_V p(I^D \mid \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v) \cdot I_a ) \pi_V (dv) \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Maximum a posteriori estimation]] (MAP) estimation is central to modern [[statistical theory]]. Parameters of interest &lt;math&gt; \theta \in \Theta &lt;/math&gt; take many forms including (i) disease type such as [[neurodegenerative]] or [[neurodevelopmental]] diseases,  (ii) structure type such as cortical or subcorical structures in problems associated to segmentation of images, and (iii) template reconstruction from populations.  Given the observed image &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt;, MAP estimation maximizes the posterior:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat \theta \doteq \arg \max_{\theta \in \Theta} \log p(\theta \mid I^D). &lt;/math&gt;

This requires computation of the conditional probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(\theta\mid I^D) = \frac{p(I^D,\theta)}{p(I^D)}&lt;/math&gt;.  The multiple atlas orbit model randomizes over the denumerable set of atlases &lt;math&gt;\{ I_a, a \in \mathcal{A} \}&lt;/math&gt;. The model on images in the orbit take the form of a multi-modal mixture distribution

:&lt;math&gt;p(I^D, \theta) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}  p(I^D,\theta\mid  I_a) \pi_{\mathcal A}(a) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

The conditional Gaussian model has been examined heavily for inexact matching in dense images and for alndmark matching.

===Dense Image Matching===  
Model &lt;math&gt; I^D(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt; as a conditionally Gaussian random field conditioned, mean field,  &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1 \cdot I \doteq I(\varphi_1^{-1}), \varphi_1 \in Diff_V&lt;/math&gt;. For uniform variance the endpoint error terms plays the role of the log-conditional (only a function of the mean field) giving the endpoint term:
{{NumBlk|:|
:&lt;math&gt;
-\log p(I^D \mid  I(g)) \simeq E(\varphi_1) \doteq  \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \| I^D - I \circ \varphi_1^{-1} \|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|Conditional-Gaussian}}}}

=== Landmark Matching ===
Model &lt;math&gt;Y = \{ y_1,y_2,\dots \}&lt;/math&gt; as conditionally Gaussian with mean field &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1 (x_i), i=1,2,\dots, \varphi_1 \in Diff_V&lt;/math&gt;, constant noise variance independent of landmarks. The log-conditional (only a function of the mean field) can be viewed as the endpoint term:
:&lt;math&gt; -\log p(I^D \mid I(g))\simeq \operatorname{E}(\varphi_1) \doteq  \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}\sum_i \| y_i -\varphi_1(x_i) \|^2. &lt;/math&gt;

==MAP segmentation based on multiple atlases==
The random orbit model for multiple atlases models the orbit of shapes as the union over multiple anatomical orbits generated from the group action of diffeomorphisms, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} = \textstyle  \bigcup_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\displaystyle \operatorname{Diff}_V \cdot I_a &lt;/math&gt;, with each atlas having a template and predefined segmentation field &lt;math&gt; (I_a,W_a),a = a_1,a_2,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;. incorporating the parcellation into anatomical structures of the coordinate of the MRI.. The pairs are indexed over the voxel lattice &lt;math&gt;I_a(x_i),W_a(x_i), x_i \in X \subset {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; with an MRI image and a dense labelling of every voxel coordinate.The anatomical labelling of parcellated structures are manual delineations by neuroanatomists.

The Bayes segmentation problem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bayesian Parameter Estimation and Segmentation in the Multi-Atlas Random Orbit Model |journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2013-06-18|pmc = 3688886|pmid = 23824159|pages = e65591|volume = 8|issue = 6|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0065591|first = Xiaoying|last = Tang|first2 = Kenichi|last2 = Oishi|first3 = Andreia V.|last3 = Faria|first4 = Argye E.|last4 = Hillis|first5 = Marilyn S.|last5 = Albert|first6 = Susumu|last6 = Mori|first7 = Michael I.|last7 = Miller|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...865591T}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given measurement &lt;math&gt;I^D&lt;/math&gt; with mean field and parcellation &lt;math&gt;(I,W)&lt;/math&gt;, the anatomical labelling &lt;math&gt;\theta \doteq W&lt;/math&gt;. mustg be estimated for the measured MRI image. The mean-field of the observable &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt; image is modelled as a random deformation from one of the templates &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_a &lt;/math&gt;, which is also randomly selected, &lt;math&gt; A = a &lt;/math&gt;,. The optimal diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; \varphi  \in \mathcal{G} &lt;/math&gt; is hidden and acts on the background space of coordinates of the randomly selected template image &lt;math&gt; I_a  &lt;/math&gt;. Given a single atlas &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;, the likelihood model for inference is determined by the joint probability &lt;math&gt; p(I^D,W\mid A = a) &lt;/math&gt;; with multiple atlases, the fusion of the likelihood functions yields the multi-modal mixture model with the prior averaging over models.

The MAP estimator of segmentation  &lt;math&gt; W_a  &lt;/math&gt;  is the maximizer  &lt;math&gt; \max_{W} \log p(W \mid I^D) &lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt;, which involves the mixture over all atlases.
:&lt;math&gt; \hat W \doteq \arg \textstyle \max_W \displaystyle \log p(I^D,W) \text{ with }  p(I^D,W) =\textstyle \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \displaystyle p(I^D,W\mid A = a)\pi _A(a). &lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt; p(I^D,W) &lt;/math&gt; is computed via a fusion of likelihoods from multiple deformable atlases, with &lt;math&gt; \pi _A(a) &lt;/math&gt; being the prior probability that the observed image evolves from the specific template image &lt;math&gt; I_a &lt;/math&gt;.

The MAP segmentation can be iteratively solved via the [[Expectation–maximization algorithm|expectation-maximization]](EM) algorithm

:&lt;math&gt; W^\text{new} \doteq \arg \max_W \int \log p(W,{I^D},A, \varphi ) \, dp(A,\varphi |W^\text{old},I^D). &lt;/math&gt;

== MAP Estimation of volume templates from populations and the EM algorithm ==
Generating templates empirically from populations is a fundamental operation ubiquitous to the discipline.
Several methods based on Bayesian statistics have emerged for submanifolds and dense image volumes.
For the dense image volume case, given the observable &lt;math&gt; I^{D_1}, I^{D_2}, \dots &lt;/math&gt; the problem is to estimate the template in the orbit of dense images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;.  Ma's procedure takes an initial hypertemplate &lt;math&gt; I_0 \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \varphi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;, with the parameters to be estimated the log-coordinates &lt;math&gt;\theta \doteq v_0&lt;/math&gt; determining the geodesic mapping of the hyper-template &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0) \cdot I_0 = I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the [[Computational anatomy#The random orbit model of computational anatomy|Bayesian random orbit model of computational anatomy]] the observed MRI images &lt;math&gt;I^{D_i}&lt;/math&gt; are modelled as a conditionally Gaussian random field with mean field &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i \cdot I&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; a random unknown transformation of the template.  The MAP estimation problem is to estimate the unknown template &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; given the observed MRI images.

Ma's procedure for dense imagery takes an initial hypertemplate &lt;math&gt; I_0 \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \varphi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The observables are modelled as conditional random fields, &lt;math&gt; I^{D_i} &lt;/math&gt; a {{EquationNote|conditional-Gaussian}} random field with mean field &lt;math&gt; \varphi_i \cdot I \doteq \varphi_i \cdot \varphi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The unknown variable to be estimated explicitly by MAP is the mapping of the hyper-template &lt;math&gt; \varphi_0&lt;/math&gt;, with the other mappings considered as nuisance or hidden variables which are integrated out via the Bayes procedure.  This is accomplished using the [[expectation-maximization]] (EM) algorithm.

The orbit-model is exploited by associating the unknown to be estimated flows to their log-coordinates &lt;math&gt;v_i,i=1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; [[Computational anatomy#Riemannian exponential (geodesic positioning) and Riemannian logarithm (geodesic coordinates)|via the Riemannian geodesic log and exponential]] for [[computational anatomy]] the initial vector field in the tangent space at the identity so that &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_{i}) \doteq \varphi_i &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_{0}) &lt;/math&gt; the mapping of the hyper-template.
The MAP estimation problem becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
\max_{v_0} p(I^D, \theta = v_0) = \int p(I^D, \theta= v_0\mid v_1,v_2, \dots ) \pi(v_1,v_2, \dots ) \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

The EM algorithm takes as complete data the vector-field coordinates parameterizing the mapping, &lt;math&gt;v_i,i=1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; and compute iteratively the conditional-expectation
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
Q(\theta=v_0; \theta^\text{old}=v_0^\text{old}) &amp;
= - \operatorname{E} ( \log p(I^D, \theta=v_0 \mid v_1,v_2,\dots)|I^D, \theta^\text{old}) \\
&amp; = - \| ( \bar I^\text{old} - I_0 \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \sqrt{\beta^\text{old}} \|^2 - \|v_0\|_V^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
* Compute new template maximizing Q-function, setting &lt;math&gt;\theta^\text{new}\doteq v_0^\text{new} = \arg \max_{\theta = v_0} Q(\theta ; \theta^\text{old}=v_0^\text{old}) = - \| ( \bar I^\text{old} - I_0 \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \sqrt{\beta^\text{old}}\|^2
- \| v_0\|_V^2&lt;/math&gt;
* Compute the mode-approximation for the expectation updating the expected-values for the mode values:
:: &lt;math&gt;v_i^\text{new} = \arg \max_{v: \dot \varphi = v \circ \varphi } - \int_0^1 \| v_t \|_V^2 \, dt - \| I^{D_i} - I_0 \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0^\text{old})^{-1} \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v)^{-1}  \|^2. i=1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\beta^\text{new} (x) = \sum_{i=1}^n | D \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_i^\text{new})(x) |, \text{ with } \bar I^\text{new} (x) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n I^{D_i} \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_i^\text{new}) | D \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_i^\text{new})(x) |  }{ \beta^\text{old}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Bowshock example - blunt body.jpg|thumb|200px|A blunt body fired from a gun against a supersonic flow in a [[wind tunnel]], producing a bow shock.]]
A '''bow shock''', also called a '''detached shock''' or '''normal shock''', is a curved, stationary [[shock wave]] that is found in a [[supersonic]] flow past a finite body. The name comes from the example of a [[bow wave]] that forms at the bow of a ship when it moves through the water.

Unlike an [[oblique shock]], the bow shock is not necessarily attached to the tip of the body. Oblique shock angles are limited in formation and are based on the flow deflection angle, upstream [[Mach number]]. When these limitations are exceeded (greater deflection angle or lower Mach number), a detached bow shock forms instead of an [[oblique shock]].  As bow shocks form for high flow deflection angles, they are often seen forming around blunt objects.
In other words, when the needed rotation of the fluid exceeds the maximum achievable rotation angle for an oblique attached shock, the shock detaches from the body. Downstream of the shock, the flow-field is [[Speed of sound|subsonic]], and the boundary condition can be respected at the [[stagnation point]].

The bow shock significantly increases the [[drag (physics)|drag]] in a vehicle traveling at a supersonic speed.  This property was utilized in the design of the return capsules during space missions such as the [[Apollo program]], which need a high amount of drag in order to slow down during [[atmospheric reentry]].

Bow shocks only occur when the local angle of the leading edge of the body exceeds the critical angle below which oblique shocks occur.The flow across the bow shock is non isentropic.

A '''capacitively coupled plasma''' ('''CCP''') is one of the most common types of industrial [[plasma source]]s. It essentially consists of two metal [[electrode]]s separated by a small distance, placed in a reactor. The gas pressure in the reactor can be lower than atmosphere or it can be [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheric]]. 

==Description==
A typical CCP system is driven by a single [[radio frequency|radio-frequency]] (RF) power supply, typically at [[ISM band|13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz]].&lt;ref&gt;UK Wireless Telegraphy (Short Range Devices) (Exemption) Regulations 1993 [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1993/Uksi_19931591_en_2.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of two electrodes is connected to the power supply, and the other one is [[ground (electricity)|grounded]]. As this configuration is similar in principle to a [[capacitor]] in an electric circuit, the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] formed in this configuration is called a capacitively coupled plasma. 

When an [[electric field]] is generated between electrodes, atoms are ionized and release electrons.  The [[electron]]s in the gas are accelerated by the RF field and can ionize the gas directly or indirectly by [[collision]]s, producing [[secondary electrons]]. When the electric field is strong enough, it can lead to what is known as [[electron avalanche]].  After [[avalanche breakdown]], the gas becomes electrically [[conductive]] due to abundant free electrons. Often it accompanies light emission from excited atoms or molecules in the gas. When visible light is produced, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] generation can be indirectly observed even with bare eyes.

A variation on capacitively coupled plasma involves isolating one of the electrodes, usually with a [[capacitor]].  The capacitor appears like a [[short circuit]] to the high frequency RF field, but like an [[open-circuit voltage|open circuit]] to [[direct current]] (DC) field.  Electrons impinge on the electrode in the [[Debye sheath|sheath]], and the electrode quickly acquires a negative charge (or self-bias) because the capacitor does not allow it to discharge to ground.  This sets up a secondary, DC field across the plasma in addition to the [[alternating current]] (AC) field.  Massive [[ion]]s are unable to react to the quickly changing AC field, but the strong, persistent DC field accelerates them toward the self-biased electrode.  These energetic ions are exploited in many [[microfabrication]] processes (see [[reactive-ion etching]] (RIE)) by placing a substrate on the isolated (self-biased) electrode.

CCPs have wide applications in the semiconductor processing industry for [[thin film deposition]] (see [[sputtering]], [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD)) and [[etching (microfabrication)#Plasma etching|etching]].

[[Image:COSAG-diagram.png|thumb|left|Principle of a COSAG propulsion system]]
'''Combined steam and gas (COSAG)''' is a [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] system for [[ship]]s using a combination of [[steam turbine]]s and [[gas turbine]]s to power the [[propeller shaft|shafts]]. A [[transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and [[clutch]]es enable either of the engines or both of them together to drive the shaft. It has the advantage of the cruising efficiency and reliability of steam and the rapid acceleration and start-up time of gas. This system was mainly used on first-generation gas-turbine ships such as the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]] [[County class destroyer|''County'' class destroyer]] and [[Tribal class frigate|''Tribal'' class frigate]].

The [[Spanish aircraft carrier Dédalo]] also used it.

A '''dynamic shear rheometer''', commonly known as '''DSR''', is used for research and development as well as for quality control in the manufacture of a wide range of materials. Dynamic shear rheometers have been used since 1993 when Superpave was used for characterising and understanding high temperature [[rheological]] properties of [[asphalt]] binders in both the molten and solid state and is fundamental in order formulate the chemistry and predict the end-use performance of these materials. 

This is done by deriving the complex modulus (G*) from the storage modulus (elastic response, G') and loss modulus (viscous behaviour, G") yielding G* as a function of stress over strain. It is used to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of asphalt binders at intermediate temperatures from 10° to 150&amp;nbsp;°C (50° to 302&amp;nbsp;°F).

'''Easy Being Green''' is one of the largest [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] operators in Australia. It was established in 2004 and have been responsible for organising mass consumer action on energy efficiency. As of 2013 the company had aided over 750,000 homes and businesses with energy efficiency. The company has managed to prevent more than 5 million tonnes of [[carbon]] [[pollution]] from entering the atmosphere through their various energy efficiency projects.&lt;ref name=EBG&gt;[http://www.easybeinggreen.com.au www.easybeinggreen.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

Easy Being Green was founded in 2004 by Nic Frances to focus on residential energy efficiency in Australia. His work in the UK to provide assistance and employment opportunities to vulnerable people was acknowledged when he was awarded the [[MBE]]. In 1998, he emigrated from the UK to Australia. There, he led the [[Brotherhood of St Laurence]] until 2004. His work earned him an [[Australian Centenary Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saxton.com.au/nic-frances/ www.saxton.com.au/nic-frances/]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005 to 2007 Paul Gilding took over the running of Easy Being Green. Prior to this, Gilding served with [[Greenpeace]] between 1989 and 1994 as an Executive Director for Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Australia. Gilding helped build Easy Being Green to a successful business employing over 200 people. The company used [[carbon trading]] to drive mass consumer action on energy efficiency. In doing so it achieved 4,300,000 tonnes of CO2 reductions and established domestic energy efficiency as a mainstream consumer and policy priority opportunity in Australia.
&lt;ref&gt;http://paulgilding.com/who-is-paul/pauls-history&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Easy Being Green was acquired by [[Jackgreen]] Ltd, Australia’s only renewable energy retailer. The business continued as Jackgreen’s energy efficiency arm, offering free residential energy efficiency services and upgrades. Easy Being Green in 2009 launched a major campaign on [[Solar hot water]] in which it offered a free system with an interest free green loan on the installation.
  
In 2010, the founder of Jackgreen Ltd, Andrew Randall, purchased the Easy Being Green assets and has been running it ever since. The company today continues as a leading Australian energy efficiency organization, with large residential energy efficiency programs, energy efficiency audits, green loans, a strong commercial efficient lighting operation and solar sales and installation.

== Victorian Energy Efficiency Target Activities ==

Easy Being Green have operated under the Victorian Energy Efficiency Target (VEET) Scheme&lt;ref name=VEET&gt;[https://www.veet.vic.gov.au/public/Public.aspx?id=Home VEET Scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;  since its commencement in 2009 and are still offering these upgrades. The scheme is planned to last until 2030 and is regulated under the Essential Services Commission (ESC). All retrofit upgrade installers are required to hold qualifications in ''Retrofitting Homes for Energy and Water Efficiency'' and ''Work Safely at Heights, or hold an A-Grade Electrical License.'' Products that Easy Being Green have been able to supply for free to homes across the Australian state of Victoria are:
* Standby-Power Controllers
* Water-Saving Shower Roses (Fixed and Handheld)
* External Door Draught Excluders
* Chimney Seals
* CFL &amp; LED Globes
* LED Downlights
* LED Reflector Globes
Under the VEET Scheme, and as a major partner with Philips Lighting, Easy Being Green have been able to supply thousands of businesses in Victoria with energy efficient lighting upgrades either free of cost or at a heavily subsidised price depending on a number of eligibility criteria set by the Essential Services Commission. Although the Essential Services Commission frequently review these criteria Easy Being Green always aims to supply a lighting upgrade wherein the receiving business will have under a 1-year payback period on any investments made in to lighting upgrades.  Products that Easy Being Green are able to supply to businesses across the Australian state of Victoria are, but not limited to:
* LED Tubes
* LED High Bays
* LED Shopfitters

== Solar and Solar Batteries ==

Easy Being Green have supplied [[Solar hot water]] and [[Solar PV]] since 2009 to thousands of homes and businesses Australia-wide, saving millions of dollars spent on non-renewable electricity and [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. As associate members of the Clean Energy Council (CEC)&lt;ref name=CEC&gt;[https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/about.html Clean Energy Council]&lt;/ref&gt;, a not-for-profit company working closely with state and federal governments to further regulate the [[renewable energy industry]], Easy Being Green ''only'' deal with supply and install of CEC-Approved products and CEC-Approved Installers. Lists of these approved products are publicly available from the Clean Energy Council's Solar Accreditation website&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.solaraccreditation.com.au/products.html Solar Accreditation]&lt;/ref&gt;. By choosing to only deal with CEC-Approved products and installers end-users can not only be sure that the products installed will be up to Australian Standards but also gain access to the Government Rebates, known as Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs).

Easy Being Green have also supplied batteries to a large number of homes Australia-wide and have recently become a [[Tesla, Inc.]] Certified Installer of their new [[Powerwall 2]] battery.

'''Ecovative Design''' LLC is a [[biomaterials]] company headquartered in [[Green Island, New York]] that provides sustainable alternatives to [[plastic]]s and [[polystyrene]] foams for [[packaging]], [[building material]]s and other applications by using [[mushroom]] technology.

==History==
Ecovative is developed from a university project of founders Eben Bayer and Gavin McIntyre. In their Inventor's Studio course at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] taught by Burt Swersey, Eben and Gavin developed and then patented a method of growing a mushroom-based insulation, initially called [[Greensulate]] before founding Ecovative Design in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pasko|first=Jessica|title=Mushrooms are eco-friendly insulation|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/environment/2007-06-25-mushroom-insulation_N.htm|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.ecovativedesign.com/about-ecovative/history/|work=EcovativeDesign.com|publisher=Ecovative Design|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 they were awarded $16,000 from the [[National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/mar2009/id20090323_482784.htm |title=NCIIA: Promoting Student Inventors |work=Bloomburg Businessweek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816001300/http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/mar2009/id20090323_482784.htm |archivedate=2015-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, when they were awarded $700,000 first place in the Picnic Green Challenge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amerikaan wint Picnic Green Challenge|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/30/ECONOMIE/article/detail/34196/2008/09/26/Amerikaan-wint-Picnic-Green-Challenge.dhtml|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=Parool.nl|date=26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company has developed and commercialized production of a protective packaging called EcoCradle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Binder|first=Libuse|title=Ecovative Design: Making Magic Out of Mushrooms|url=http://earth911.com/news/2009/05/11/making-magic-out-of-mushrooms/|publisher=Earth 911|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is now used by [[Dell]], [[Puma SE]], and [[Steelcase]]. In 2010 they were awarded $180,000 from the [[National Science Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2010/08/10/mushroom-based-packaging-98-percent-less-energy-styrofoam|title=Mushroom-Based Packaging Uses 98% Less Energy than Styrofoam|work=Green Biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 the company received investment from [[3M]] New Ventures, The [[DOEN Foundation]], and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute allowing them to double their current staff of 25.&lt;ref name=biz2011/&gt;

In spring 2012, Ecovative Design opened a new production facility and announced a partnership with [[Sealed Air]] to expand production of the packaging materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sealed Air and Ecovative Complete Agreement to Accelerate Commercialization of New Sustainable Packaging Material|url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201206200730BIZWIRE_USPRX____BW5149&amp;feedID=600&amp;press_symbol=250742|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nearing|first=Brian|title=Ecovative keeps growing|url=http://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Ecovative-keeps-growing-3608741.php#photo-3026790|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=Times Union|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 their material was used in a brick form in 'Hy-Fi', a {{convert|40|ft|meters}} tower displayed in New York by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and they started selling 'grow-it-yourself' kits.&lt;ref name=diy/&gt;

==Mushroom materials==
[[File:Mushroom Insulation Installation.jpg|thumb|A [[thermal insulation]] panel ready for installation,]]
'Mushroom materials' are a novel class of [[renewable]] biomaterial grown from fungal [[mycelium]] and low-value non-food agricultural materials using a [[patent|patented process]] developed by Ecovative Design. After being left to grow in a [[Molding (process)|former]] in a dark place for about five days during which time the fungal [[mycelium|mycelial network]] binds the mixture, the resulting light robust [[Organic matter|organic]] [[compost]]able material can be used within many products, including [[building material]]s, [[thermal insulation]] panels and protective [[packaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

The process uses an agricultural waste product such as cotton hulls, cleaning the material, heating it up, inoculating it to create growth of the fungal mycelium, growing the material for period of about five days, and finally heating it to make the fungus inert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Are mushrooms the new plastic?|time=5:45|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eben_bayer_are_mushrooms_the_new_plastic.html|work=ted.com|publisher=TED Conferences LLC|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During growth, the material's shape can be molded into various products including protective packaging, building products, apparel, car bumpers, or surfboards. 
The [[environmental footprint]] of the products is minimized through the use of agricultural waste, reliance on natural and non-controlled growth environments, and home compostable final products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mushroom-Based Packaging Uses 98% Less Energy than Styrofoam|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2010/08/10/mushroom-based-packaging-98-percent-less-energy-styrofoam|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=GreenBiz.com|date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders intention is that this technology should replace [[polystyrene]] and other petroleum-based products that take many years to decompose, or never do so.&lt;ref name=biz2011/&gt;

'''Energy in Singapore''' describes energy related issues in [[Singapore]]. Energy imports are about three times the primary energy. Oil imports in relation to the population is high.

The world's largest [[palm oil]] company, [[Wilmar International]], is based in Singapore. A [[Finland|Finnish]] company operates the world's biggest [[palm oil]] based diesel plant in Singapore with 800,000 tonnes produced annually since the end of 2010.

According to the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] Singapore had no energy production in 2008. Energy imports increased 18.6% in 2008 compared to 2004. The primary energy declined by about one third in 2007-8 but during the same period energy imports increased. Energy import was about three times the total primary energy supply in 2008. Compared to the UK in 2008, per capita electricity consumption was 135% and per capita carbon dioxide emissions were 110%. (UK: 61.35 m people 372.19 TWh electricity, 510.63Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions).&lt;ref name=IEA2010oil&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Page: 23, 52, 54 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of energy (primary energy) in Singapore is only 1/3 of the imported energy.

==Oil==
Singapore was the top 10th country in oil imports in 2008: 50 megatonnes.  For comparison, oil imports in Spain were 77 megatonnes (the top 8th country, with a population of 45.59&amp;nbsp;million) and in Italy they were 73 megatonnes (the top 9th country, with a population of 59.89&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Page: 23, 52, 54, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palm oil==
The biggest [[palm oil]] based [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] plant in the world, 800,000 t/a production, started operations in Singapore at the end of 2010 by [[Neste Oil]] from [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/talous/oikea/id76325.html Neste Oil rakentaa Singaporeen maailman suurimman biodieseltehtaan] yle 30 November 2007 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant requires almost a million tonnes of raw material annually from the [[oil palm]] ''Elaeis guineensis'', equivalent to 2,600–3,400&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; oil palm [[plantation]]. 

[[Greenpeace]] demonstrated in November 2010 in [[Espoo]] Finland by hanging an [[orangutan]] puppet in front of Neste Oil, saying that Neste Oil endangers the [[rainforest]] ecosystem. According to [[UNEP]] the majority of new palm oil plantations take place in the [[rainforests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep-wcmc.org/medialibrary/2010/09/13/666ec93b/LastStandofOrangutan.pdf The last stand: State of emergency: [[Illegal logging]], fire and palm oil in Indonesia’s national parks of the orangutan] [[UNEP]] 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[European Union]] studies the increased demand for palm oil inevitably leads to new plantations being established in the forests and [[peat]] land areas. Land use changes have large [[green house gas]] emissions making palm oil diesel much more harmful than petroleum in respect to [[global warming]]. According to [[Greenpeace]] the Neste Oil plant in Singapore made Finnish Neste Oil among the world's leading palm oil consumers leading to increased rain forest destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Neste Oilin Singaporen laitos kiihdyttää sademetsätuhoa, Greenpeace 15 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing emissions from [[deforestation]] and [[forest degradation]] (REDD) would be a way to mitigate climate change. According to [[UNEP]] the international [[REDD|REDD mechanism]] will be a key element of [[Post–Kyoto Protocol negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions|the post-2012 international climate change]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Governance UNEP page 53-63 pdf: 6-Environmental_Governance_UNEP_YearBook_09_low[1].pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilmar International]] is listed in Singapore. Headed by Kuok Khoon Hong, it is the world's largest palm oil firm.

In July 2007 [[Friends of the Earth]] Netherlands and two Indonesian NGOs accused Wilmar of illegal forest clearances in [[West Kalimantan]], inadequate [[Environmental Impact Assessment]]s and clearing land outside its concessions. Wilmar denies the allegation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3782">The '''Flood Forecasting Centre''' (FFC) is a joint venture between the [[Environment Agency]] and the [[Met Office]] to provide improved flood risk guidance for England and Wales. The FFC is based in the Operations Centre at the Met Office headquarters in Exeter and is jointly staffed from both organisations.

==Background==

Following [[2007 United Kingdom floods|severe flooding across the UK in 2007]] a review was commissioned by the government to see what lessons could be learned. Chaired by [[Sir Michael Pitt]] the review produced a number of recommendations which were published in June 2008, among them was the recommendation that the different agencies work more closely together to improve warnings services.&lt;ref name="Exetermove"/&gt;

==Formation and role==

The FFC was officially opened on 21 April 2009 in London by [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Minister]] [[Hilary Benn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2009/flood-forecasting-centre|title=New Flood Forecasting Centre officially opened|publisher=MetOffice.gov.uk|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role is to provide better advice to governments, local authorities, emergency responders and the general public via its parent organisations. It faced its first major test in November 2009 when severe flooding [[2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods|affected Northern England]], in particular [[Cumbria]] and the town of [[Cockermouth]]. The Pitt Review progress report highlighted the accuracy of the advice issued ahead of this event.&lt;ref name="Exetermove"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exeterscience.org/news/33/129/Flood-Forecasting-Centre-moves-to-Exeter.html|title=Flood Forecasting Centre moves to Exeter|publisher=Exeter Science|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 the FFC moved from central London to a permanent base within the Operations Centre at the Met Office HQ in Exeter.&lt;ref name="Exetermove"/&gt; It currently provides a range of operational [[Hydrometeorology]] services across England and Wales and limited services for Scotland and Northern Ireland.

==Operational services==

The FFC provides a range of services to a number of customer groups:

* [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004#Category 1 .26 2 responders|Category 1 and 2 responders]] in England and Wales; a daily Flood Guidance Statement, telephone consultancy and web based services
* Government Services; precautionary calls to facilitate discussion on flood risk
* Hydrometeorology Services; to Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales Flood Forecasting and Flood Resilience Teams (who in turn provide [[Flood warning#United Kingdom|flood warnings]] to the public in communities at risk)
* Coastal Services for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
* Public Services; via a [http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/3days/125305.aspx three-day flood-risk forecast]

'''High-entropy alloys''' ('''HEAs''') are substances that are constructed with equal or nearly equal quantities of five or more metals.  These alloys are currently the focus of significant attention in [[materials science]] and engineering because they have potentially desirable properties.&lt;ref name=tsai/&gt; Prior to the existence of these substances, alloys consisted of only one or two base metals. For example, additional elements can be added to iron to improve its properties, thereby creating an iron based alloy.&lt;ref name=tsai/&gt; Hence, high entropy alloys are a novel material.&lt;ref name=Wang1/&gt;&lt;ref name=tsai/&gt;

Furthermore, research indicates that some HEAs have considerably better [[strength-to-weight ratio]]s, with a higher degree of [[fracture mechanics|fracture resistance]], [[tensile strength]], as well as [[corrosion]] and [[oxidation]] resistance than conventional alloys. Although HEAs have existed since before 2004, research substantially accelerated in the 2010s.&lt;ref name ="tsai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsai|first1=Ming-Hung|last2=Yeh|first2=Jien-Wei|title=High-Entropy Alloys: A Critical Review

==Early development==
Although HEAs were described as early as 1981&lt;ref&gt;Vincent AJB; Cantor B: part II thesis, University of Sussex (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; and 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Huang KH, Yeh JW. A study on multicomponent alloy systems containing equal-mole elements [M.S. thesis]. Hsinchu: National Tsing Hua University; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  significant research interest did not develop until after independent 2004 papers by [[Jien-Wei Yeh]] and [[Brian Cantor]], with Yeh's first paper on the topic published 2 months sooner. Yeh also coined the term "high-entropy alloy" when he attributed the high configurational entropy as the mechanism stabilizing the [[solid solution]] phase.&lt;ref name="Yeh-AEM 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeh|first=J.-W.|author2=Chen, S.-K. |author3=Lin, S.-J. |author4=Gan, J.-Y. |author5=Chin, T.-S. |author6=Shun, T.-T. |author7=Tsau, C.-H. |author8=Chang, S.-Y. |title=Nanostructured High-Entropy Alloys with Multiple Principal Elements: Novel Alloy Design Concepts and Outcomes|journal=Advanced Engineering Materials|date=May 2004|volume=6|issue=5|pages=299–303|doi=10.1002/adem.200300567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cantor, not knowing of Yeh's work, did not describe his alloy as a "high-entropy" alloy, but the base alloy he developed, equiatomic FeCrMnNiCo, has been the subject of considerable work in the field.&lt;ref name="Cantor 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantor|first=B. |author2=Chang, I.T.H. |author3=Knight, P. |author4=Vincent, A.J.B.|title=Microstructural development in equiatomic multicomponent alloys|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: A|date=July 2004|volume=375–377|pages=213–218|doi=10.1016/j.msea.2003.10.257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the classification of high entropy alloys and multi-component systems, nuclear science had highlighted a system that can now be classified a high entropy alloy: within [[nuclear fuels]] Mo-Pd-Rh-Ru-Tc particles form at grain boundaries and at fission gas bubbles.&lt;ref name="Middleburgh 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Middleburgh|first=S.C. |author2=King, D.M. |author3=Lumpkin, G.R. |title=Atomic scale modelling of hexagonal structured metallic [[fission product]] alloys|journal=Royal Society Open Science|date=April 2015|volume=2|issue=1|pages=140292|doi=10.1098/rsos.140292|bibcode = 2015RSOS....2n0292M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the behavior of these '5 metal particles' was of specific interest to the medical industry as [[Technetium-99m|Tc-99m]] is an important [[medical imaging]] isotope.

==Definition==
There is no universally agreed-upon definition of a HEA. Yeh originally defined HEAs as alloys containing at least 5 elements with concentrations between 5 and 35 atomic percent.&lt;ref name="Yeh-AEM 2004" /&gt; Later research however, suggested that this definition could be expanded. Otto et al. suggested that only alloys that form a solid solution with no [[intermetallic]] phases should be considered true high-entropy alloys, as the formation of ordered phases decreases the entropy of the system.&lt;ref name="enthalpy effect"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Otto|first=F. |author2=Yang, Y. |author3=Bei, H. |author4=George, E.P.|title=Relative effects of enthalpy and entropy on the phase stability of equiatomic high-entropy alloys|journal=Acta Materialia|date=April 2013|volume=61|issue=7|pages=2628–2638|doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2013.01.042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have described 4-component alloys as high-entropy alloys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zou|first=Yu |author2=Maiti, Soumyadipta |author3=Steurer, Walter |author4=Spolenak, Ralph|title=Size-dependent plasticity in an Nb25Mo25Ta25W25 refractory high-entropy alloy|journal=Acta Materialia|date=February 2014|volume=65|pages=85–97|doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2013.11.049}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have suggested that alloys meeting the other requirements of HEAs, but with only 2–4 elements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gali|first=A.|author2=George, E.P.|title=Tensile properties of high- and medium-entropy alloys|journal=Intermetallics|date=August 2013|volume=39|pages=74–78|doi=10.1016/j.intermet.2013.03.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a mixing entropy between [[ideal gas constant|R]] and 1.5R&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miracle|first=Daniel |author2=Miller, Jonathan |author3=Senkov, Oleg |author4=Woodward, Christopher |author5=Uchic, Michael |author6=Tiley, Jaimie|title=Exploration and Development of High-Entropy Alloys for Structural Applications|journal=Entropy|date=10 January 2014|volume=16|issue=1|pages=494–525|doi=10.3390/e16010494|bibcode = 2014Entrp..16..494M }}&lt;/ref&gt; should be considered "medium-entropy" alloys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gali|first1=A.|last2=George|first2=E.P.|title=Tensile properties of high- and medium-entropy alloys|journal=Intermetallics|date=August 2013|volume=39|pages=74–78|doi=10.1016/j.intermet.2013.03.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alloy design==
In conventional alloy design, one primary element such as iron, copper, or aluminum is chosen for its properties. Then, small amounts of additional elements are added to improve or add properties. Even among binary alloy systems, there are few common cases of both elements being used in nearly-equal proportions such as [[Lead|Pb]]-[[Tin|Sn]] [[solder]]s. Therefore, much is known from experimental results about phases near the edges of [[binary phase diagram]]s and the corners of [[Ternary plot|ternary phase diagram]]s and much less is known about phases near the centers. In higher-order (4+ components) systems that cannot be easily represented on a 2-dimensional phase diagram, virtually nothing is known.&lt;ref name="Cantor 2004" /&gt;

===Phase formation===
[[Gibbs' phase rule]], &lt;math&gt;F=C-P+2&lt;/math&gt;, can be used to determine an upper bound on the number of phases that will form in an equilibrium system. In his 2004 paper, Cantor created a 20-component alloy containing 5 at% of Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, W, Mo, Nb, Al, Cd, Sn, Pb, Bi, Zn, Ge, Si, Sb, and Mg. At constant pressure, the phase rule would allow for up to 21 phases at equilibrium, but far fewer actually formed. The predominant phase was a [[face-centered cubic]] solid solution phase, containing mainly Fe, Ni, Cr, Co, and Mn. From that result, the FeCrMnNiCo alloy, which forms only a solid solution phase, was developed.&lt;ref name="Cantor 2004" /&gt;

The [[Hume-Rothery rules]] have historically been applied to determine whether a mixture will form a solid solution. Research into high-entropy alloys has found that in multi-component systems, these rules tend to be relaxed slightly. In particular, the rule that solvent and solute elements must have the same crystal structure does not seem to apply, as Fe, Ni, Cr, Co, and Mn have 4 different crystal structures as pure elements (and when the elements are present in equal concentrations, there can be no meaningful distinction between "solvent" and "solute" elements).&lt;ref name="enthalpy effect" /&gt;

===Thermodynamic mechanisms===
The multi-component alloys Yeh developed also consisted mostly or entirely of solid solution phases, contrary to what had been expected from earlier work in multi-component systems, primarily in the field of [[metallic glass]]es.&lt;ref name="Yeh-AEM 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greer|first=A. Lindsay|title=Confusion by design|journal=Nature|date=25 December 1993|volume=366|issue=6453|pages=303–304|doi=10.1038/366303a0|bibcode = 1993Natur.366..303G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeh attributed this result to the high configurational, or [[Entropy of mixing|mixing, entropy]] of a random solid solution containing numerous elements. Because &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}G={\Delta}H-T{\Delta}S&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase with the lowest [[Gibbs free energy of formation]] (ΔG) will be the phase formed at equilibrium, increasing ΔS (entropy) will increase the likelihood of a phase being stable. The mixing entropy for a random ideal solid solution can be calculated by:
:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta}S_{mix}=-R\sum_{i=1}^N c_i \ln{c_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where R is the [[ideal gas constant]], N is the number of components, and c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the atomic fraction of component i. From this it can be seen that alloys in which the components are present in equal proportions will have the highest entropy, and adding additional elements will increase the entropy. A 5 component, equiatomic alloy will have a mixing entropy of 1.61R.&lt;ref name="Yeh-AEM 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phase rules"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Y. |author2=Zhou, Y. J. |author3=Lin, J. P. |author4=Chen, G. L. |author5=Liaw, P. K.|title=Solid-Solution Phase Formation Rules for Multi-component Alloys|journal=Advanced Engineering Materials|date=June 2008|volume=10|issue=6|pages=534–538|doi=10.1002/adem.200700240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However entropy alone is not sufficient to stabilize the solid solution phase in every system. The enthalpy of mixing (ΔH), must also be taken into account. This can be calculated using:
:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta}H_{mix}=\sum_{i=1,i{\ne}j}^N 4{\Delta}H^{mix}_{AB}c_i c_j&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}H^{mix}_{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is the binary enthalpy of mixing for A and B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Akira|author2=Inoue, Akihisa|title=Classification of Bulk Metallic Glasses by Atomic Size Difference, Heat of Mixing and Period of Constituent Elements and Its Application to Characterization of the Main Alloying Element|journal=Materials Transactions|date=2005|volume=46|issue=12|pages=2817–2829|doi=10.2320/matertrans.46.2817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang et al. found, empirically, that in order to form a complete solid solution, ΔH&lt;sub&gt;mix&lt;/sub&gt; should be between -10 and 5 kJ/mol.&lt;ref name="phase rules" /&gt; In addition, Otto et al. found that if the alloy contains any pair of elements that tend to form ordered compounds in their binary system, a multi-component alloy containing them is also likely to form ordered compounds.&lt;ref name="enthalpy effect" /&gt;

Both of the thermodynamic parameters can be combined into a single, unitless parameter Ω:
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega=\frac{T_m {\Delta}S_{mix}}{\left\vert{\Delta}H_{mix}\right\vert}&lt;/math&gt;
where T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the average melting point of the elements in the alloy. Ω should be greater than or equal to 1.1 to promote solid solution development.&lt;ref name="2014 review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Yong|last2=Zuo|first2=Ting Ting|last3=Tang|first3=Zhi|last4=Gao|first4=Michael C.|last5=Dahmen|first5=Karin A.|last6=Liaw|first6=Peter K.|last7=Lu|first7=Zhao Ping|title=Microstructures and properties of high-entropy alloys|journal=Progress in Materials Science|date=April 2014|volume=61|pages=1–93|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2013.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kinetic mechanisms===
The [[atomic radii]] of the components must also be similar in order to form a solid solution. Zhang et al. proposed a parameter δ representing the difference in atomic radii:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N c_i \left( 1-\frac{r_i}{\bar{r}} \right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the atomic radius of element i and &lt;math&gt;\bar{r}=\sum_{i=1}^N c_i r_i&lt;/math&gt;. Formation of a solid solution phase requires a δ≤6.6%, but some alloys with 4%&lt;δ≤6.6% do form intermetallics.&lt;ref name="phase rules" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2014 review" /&gt;

===Other properties===
For those alloys that do form solid solutions, an additional empirical parameter has been proposed to predict the [[crystal structure]] that will form. If the average [[valence electron]] concentration (VEC) of the alloy is ≥8, the alloy will form a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice. If the average VEC is &lt;6.87, it will form a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) lattice. For values in between, it will form a mixture of fcc and bcc.&lt;ref name=VEC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guo|first=Sheng |author2=Ng, Chun |author3=Lu, Jian |author4=Liu, C. T. |title=Effect of valence electron concentration on stability of fcc or bcc phase in high-entropy alloys|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=2011|volume=109|issue=10|pages=103505|doi=10.1063/1.3587228|bibcode = 2011JAP...109j3505G }}&lt;/ref&gt; VEC has also been used to predict the formation of [[Frank Kasper phases|σ-phase]] intermetallics (which are generally brittle and undesirable) in chromium and vanadium-containing HEAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsai|first1=Ming-Hung|last2=Tsai|first2=Kun-Yo|last3=Tsai|first3=Che-Wei|last4=Lee|first4=Chi|last5=Juan|first5=Chien-Chang|last6=Yeh|first6=Jien-Wei|title=Criterion for Sigma Phase Formation in Cr- and V-Containing High-Entropy Alloys|journal=Materials Research Letters|date=20 August 2013|volume=1|issue=4|pages=207–212|doi=10.1080/21663831.2013.831382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
High-entropy alloys are mostly produced using distinct methods that depend on the initial phase - starting either from a liquid, solid, or gas state.

* Most HEAs have been produced using liquid-phase methods include [[arc melting]], [[induction melting]], and [[Bridgman solidification]].&lt;ref name ="2014 review" /&gt;
* Solid-state processing is generally done by [[mechanical alloying]] using a high-energy [[ball mill]]. This method produces powders that can then be processed using conventional [[powder metallurgy]] methods or [[spark plasma sintering]]. This method allows for alloys to be produced that would be difficult or impossible to produce using casting, such as AlLiMgScTi, in which the melting points of the constituent elements has a range of nearly 1500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name ="2014 review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Youssef"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Youssef|first1=Khaled M.|last2=Zaddach|first2=Alexander J.|last3=Niu|first3=Changning|last4=Irving|first4=Douglas L.|last5=Koch|first5=Carl C.|title=A Novel Low-Density, High-Hardness, High-entropy Alloy with Close-packed Single-phase Nanocrystalline Structures|journal=Materials Research Letters|date=9 December 2014|volume=3|issue=2|pages=95–99|doi=10.1080/21663831.2014.985855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ji|first1=Wei|last2=Wang|first2=Weimin|last3=Wang|first3=Hao|last4=Zhang|first4=Jinyong|last5=Wang|first5=Yucheng|last6=Zhang|first6=Fan|last7=Fu|first7=Zhengyi|title=Alloying behavior and novel properties of CoCrFeNiMn high-entropy alloy fabricated by mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering|journal=Intermetallics|date=January 2015|volume=56|pages=24–27|doi=10.1016/j.intermet.2014.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gas-phase processing includes processes such as [[sputtering]] or [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE), which can be used to carefully control different elemental compositions to get high-entropy metallic&lt;ref name="Zou 7748"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ultrastrong ductile and stable high-entropy alloys at small scales|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150710/ncomms8748/full/ncomms8748.html|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2015-07-10|pmc = 4510962|pmid = 26159936|volume = 6|doi = 10.1038/ncomms8748|first = Yu|last = Zou|first2 = Huan|last2 = Ma|first3 = Ralph|last3 = Spolenak|pages=7748|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E7748Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ceramic films.&lt;ref name ="2014 review" /&gt;

Other HEAs have been produced by [[thermal spray]], [[laser cladding]], and [[Electroplating|electrodeposition]].&lt;ref name="2014 review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yao"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yao|first1=Chen-Zhong|last2=Zhang|first2=Peng|last3=Liu|first3=Meng|last4=Li|first4=Gao-Ren|last5=Ye|first5=Jian-Qing|last6=Liu|first6=Peng|last7=Tong|first7=Ye-Xiang|title=Electrochemical preparation and magnetic study of Bi–Fe–Co–Ni–Mn high-entropy alloy|journal=Electrochimica Acta|date=November 2008|volume=53|issue=28|pages=8359–8365|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2008.06.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling and simulation==
The atomic-scale complexity presents additional challenges to computational modelling of high-entropy alloys. Thermodynamic modelling using the [[CALPHAD]] method requires extrapolating from binary and ternary systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Chuan|last2=Zhang|first2=Fan|last3=Chen|first3=Shuanglin|last4=Cao|first4=Weisheng|title=Computational Thermodynamics Aided High-Entropy Alloy Design|journal=JOM|date=29 June 2012|volume=64|issue=7|pages=839–845|doi=10.1007/s11837-012-0365-6|bibcode = 2012JOM....64g.839Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commercial thermodynamic databases are designed for, and may only be valid for, alloys consisting primarily of a single element. Thus, they require experimental verification or additional ''ab initio'' calculations such as [[density functional theory]] (DFT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Michael|last2=Alman|first2=David|title=Searching for Next Single-Phase High-Entropy Alloy Compositions|journal=Entropy|date=18 October 2013|volume=15|issue=10|pages=4504–4519|doi=10.3390/e15104504|bibcode = 2013Entrp..15.4504G }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DFT modeling of complex, random alloys has its own challenges, as the method requires defining a fixed-size cell, which can introduce non-random periodicity. This is commonly overcome using the method of "special quasirandom structures," designed to most closely approximate the [[radial distribution function]] of a random system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zunger|first1=Alex|last2=Wei|first2=S.-H.|last3=Ferreira|first3=L.

Further, modeling techniques are being used to suggest new HEAs for targeted applications. The use of modeling techniques in this 'combinatorial explosion' is necessary for targeted and rapid HEA discovery and application.

[[Simulations]] have highlighted the preference for local ordering in some high entropy alloys and, when the [[Enthalpy|enthalpies]] of formation are combined with terms for [[configurational entropy]], transition temperatures between order and disorder can be estimated.&lt;ref name="King2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=D.M. |author2=Middleburgh, S.C. |author3=Edwards, L. |author4=Lumpkin, G.R. |author5=Cortie, M. |title=Predicting the Crystal Structure and Phase Transitions in High-Entropy Alloys|journal=JOM|date=October 2015|volume=67|issue=10|pages=2375–2380|doi=10.1007/s11837-015-1495-4|bibcode = 2015JOM...tmp..273K |url=https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/41212/4/Paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  - allowing one to understand when effects like [[age hardening]] and degradation of an alloy's [[mechanical properties]] may be an issue.

== Properties and potential uses ==

===Mechanical===
The crystal structure of HEAs has been found to be the dominant factor in determining the mechanical properties. bcc HEAs typically have high yield strength and low ductility and vice versa for fcc HEAs. Some alloys have been particularly noted for their exceptional mechanical properties. A [[refractory]] alloy, VNbMoTaW maintains a high yield strength (&gt;{{convert|600|MPa|ksi|lk=on||abbr=on}}) even at a temperature of {{convert|1400|C|F}}, significantly outperforming conventional [[superalloys]] such as [[Inconel]] 718. However, room temperature ductility is poor, less is known about other important high temperature properties such as [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] resistance, and the density of the alloy is higher than conventional nickel-based superalloys.&lt;ref name="2014 review" /&gt;

CoCrFeMnNi has been found to have exceptional low-temperature mechanical properties and high [[fracture toughness]], with both ductility and yield strength increasing as the test temperature was reduced from room temperature to {{convert|77|K|F}}. This was attributed to the onset of nanoscale [[twin boundary]] formation, an additional [[deformation mechanism]] that was not in effect at higher temperatures. As such, it may have applications as a structural material in low-temperature applications or, because of its high toughness, as an energy-absorbing material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Otto|first=F. |author2=Dlouhý, A. |author3=Somsen, Ch. |author4=Bei, H. |author5=Eggeler, G. |author6=George, E.P. |title=The influences of temperature and microstructure on the tensile properties of a CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy|journal=Acta Materialia|date=September 2013|volume=61|issue=15|pages=5743–5755|doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2013.06.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later research showed that lower-entropy alloys with fewer elements or non-equiatomic compositions may have higher strength&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Z.|last2=Bei|first2=H.|last3=Otto|first3=F.|last4=Pharr|first4=G.M.|last5=George|first5=E.P.|title=Recovery, recrystallization, grain growth and phase stability of a family of FCC-structured multi-component equiatomic solid solution alloys|journal=Intermetallics|date=March 2014|volume=46|pages=131–140|doi=10.1016/j.intermet.2013.10.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; or higher toughness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaddach|first1=A.J.|last2=Scattergood|first2=R.O.|last3=Koch|first3=C.C.|title=Tensile properties of low-stacking fault energy high-entropy alloys|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: A|date=June 2015|volume=636|pages=373–378|doi=10.1016/j.msea.2015.03.109}}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[Ductility#Ductile–brittle transition temperature|ductile to brittle transition]] was observed in the bcc AlCoCrFeNi alloy in tests as low as 77 K.&lt;ref name="2014 review" /&gt;

Al&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;CoCrCuFeNi was found to have a high [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue life]] and [[endurance limit]], possibly exceeding some conventional steel and titanium alloys. But there was significant variability in the results, suggesting the material is very sensitive to defects introduced during manufacturing such as [[aluminum oxide]] particles and microcracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemphill|first=M.A. |author2=Yuan, T. |author3=Wang, G.Y. |author4=Yeh, J.W. |author5=Tsai, C.W. |author6=Chuang, A. |author7=Liaw, P.K.|title=Fatigue behavior of Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloys|journal=Acta Materialia|date=September 2012|volume=60|issue=16|pages=5723–5734|doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2012.06.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than bulk HEAs, small-scale HEA samples (e.g. NbTaMoW micro-pillars) exhibit extraordinarily high yield strengths of 4-10 GPa —one order of magnitude higher than that of its bulk form—and their ductility is considerably improved. Additionally, such HEA films show substantially enhanced stability for high-temperature, long-duration conditions (at 1,100&amp;nbsp;°C for 3 days). Small-scale HEAs combining these properties represent a new class of materials in small-dimension devices potentially for high-stress and high-temperature applications.&lt;ref name="Zou 7748"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Size-dependent plasticity in an Nb25Mo25Ta25W25 refractory high-entropy alloy|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645413009075|journal = Acta Materialia|date = 2014-02-15|pages = 85–97|volume = 65|doi = 10.1016/j.actamat.2013.11.049|first = Yu|last = Zou|first2 = Soumyadipta|last2 = Maiti|first3 = Walter|last3 = Steurer|first4 = Ralph|last4 = Spolenak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical and magnetic===
CoCrCuFeNi is an fcc alloy that was found to be paramagnetic.

===Other===
The high concentrations of multiple elements leads to slow [[diffusion]]. The [[activation energy]] for diffusion was found to be higher for several elements in CoCrFeMnNi than in pure metals and stainless steels, leading to lower diffusion coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsai|first=K.-Y. |author2=Tsai, M.-H. |author3=Yeh, J.-W. |title=Sluggish diffusion in Co–Cr–Fe–Mn–Ni high-entropy alloys|journal=Acta Materialia|date=August 2013|volume=61|issue=13|pages=4887–4897|doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2013.04.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hybrid renewable energy systems''' (HRES) are becoming popular as [[stand-alone power system]]s for providing electricity in remote areas due to advances in [[renewable energy]] technologies and subsequent rise in prices of [[petroleum]] products. A hybrid energy system, or [[hybrid power]], usually consists of two or more renewable energy sources used together to provide increased system efficiency as well as greater balance in energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ginn|first1=Claire|title=Energy pick n’ mix: are hybrid systems the next big thing?|url=https://blog.csiro.au/energy-pick-n-mix-hybrid-systems-next-big-thing/|website=www.csiro.au|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Biomass-wind-fuel cell===
For example, let us consider a load of 100% power supply and there is no renewable system to fulfill this need, so two or more renewable energy system can be combined. For example, 60% from a [[biomass]] system, 20% from wind system and the remainder from [[fuel cell]]s. Thus combining all these renewable energy systems may provide 100% of the power and energy requirements for the load, such as a home or business.

===Photovoltaic and wind===
[[Image:Block diagram.jpg|thumb|500px|Block diagram of a PV/wind hybrid energy system]]
{{clear}}
Another example of a hybrid energy system is a [[photovoltaic]] array coupled with a [[wind turbine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pvresources.com/en/hybrid.php|title=Hybrid photovoltaic systems|publisher=Denis Lenardic|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128022703/http://pvresources.com/en/hybrid.php|archivedate=2010-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would create more output from the wind turbine during the winter, whereas during the summer, the [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] would produce their peak output. Hybrid energy systems often yield greater economic and environmental returns than wind, solar, [[Geothermal power|geothermal]] or trigeneration stand-alone systems by themselves.

===Completely Renewable Idea ===
Completely Renewable Hybrid Power Plant (solar, wind, biomass, hydrogen)
A hybrid power plant consisting of these four renewable energy sources can be made into operation by proper utilization of these resources in a completely controlled manner.
Hybrid Energy Europe-USA.
Caffese in Europe introduce hybridizing HVDC transmission with Marine hydro pumped Energy Storage via elpipes. The project of Caffese is 3 marine big lakes producing 1800 GW and transmission with elpipes.
A part 1200 GW produce water fuels-wind fuels-solar fuels 210 billion liter year. (IEEE Power and Engineering Society-General Meeting Feb.9.2011,Arpa-E,Doe USA,MSE Italy,European Commission-Energy-Caffese plan and ConsortiumHybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) are becoming popular as stand-alone power systems for providing electricity in remote areas due to advances in renewable energy technologies and subsequent rise in prices of petroleum products. A hybrid energy system, or hybrid power, usually consists of two or more renewable energy sources used together to provide increased system efficiency as well as greater balance in energy supply

==Drawbacks==
Most of us already know how a solar/wind/biomass power generating system works, all these generating systems have some or the other drawbacks, like Solar panels are too costly and the production cost of power by using them is generally higher than the conventional process, it is not available in the night or cloudy days. Similarly Wind turbines can’t operate in high or low wind speeds and Biomass plants collapse at low temperatures.

==How to Overcome?== 
So if all the three are combined into one hybrid power generating system the drawbacks can be avoided partially/completely, depending on the control units.
As the one or more drawbacks can be overcome by the other, as in northern hemisphere it is generally seen that in windy days the solar power is limited and vice versa and in summer and rainy season the biomass plant can operate in a full flagged so the power generation can be maintained in the above stated condition. The cost of solar panel can be subsided by using glass lenses, mirrors to heat up a fluid, that can rotate the common turbine used by wind and other sources.
Now the question arises what about the winter nights or cloudy winter days with very low wind speeds. Here comes the activity of the Hydrogen. As we know the process of electrolysis can produce hydrogen by breaking water into hydrogen and oxygen, it can be stored; hydrogen is also a good fuel and burns with oxygen to give water. Hydrogen can be used to maintain the temperature of the biomass reservoir in winter so that it can produce biogas in optimum amount for the power generation.
As stated above biogas is a good source in summer; in this period the solar energy available is also at its peak, so if the demand and supply is properly checked and calculated the excess energy can be used in the production of hydrogen and can be stored. In sunny, windy &amp;hot day, the turbine operates with full speed as the supply is maximum, and this excess power can be consumed for the process of manufacturing hydrogen.
In winter, the power consumption is also low so the supply limit is low, and obtained with lesser consumption. Driving hybrid cars will disable this outcome.

==Areas Of Research==
* Amount of Hydrogen produce by amount of power utilized and reusing the hydrogen for maintaining the temperature. Is it cost efficient?
* Limited to areas near equatorial regions (23deg N-23deg S), at low altitudes.
* Infrastructure cost may be high.

==Regulation==
To get constant power supply, the output of the renewables may be connected to the [[rechargeable battery]] bank and then to the load. If the load is [[alternating current]] (AC), then an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]] is used to convert the [[direct current]] (DC) supply from the battery to the AC load.
Consideration about voltage transition among modules starting from Wind Generator,Battery Charger Controller and Inverter should be subject to voltage standard which mainly focus about voltage compatibility.

==Need for research==
The key to cost reductions of this order is, of course, the right sort of support for innovation and development - something that has been lacking for the past and, arguably, is still only patchy at present. Research and development efforts in solar, wind, and other renewable energy technologies are required to continue for:
* improving their performance, 
* establishing techniques for accurately predicting their output 
* reliably integrating them with other conventional generating sources

Economic aspects of these technologies are sufficiently promising to include them in developing power generation capacity for [[developing countries]].

'''Inserts''' are [[pin]]s, bolts, [[screw]]s, [[joint (disambiguation)|joints]] and other structures that are used to transfer localized [[structural load|loads]] to a [[composite material|composite]] panel or to join two composite panels together.  Metallic inserts are commonly used in the [[aerospace]] and [[marine (ocean)|marine]] industries to attach objects to [[sandwich structured composite|sandwich composite]] panels.

Here is some history as referenced in the forward of ASME B18.29.1.  Helical coil screw thread inserts have been in use for many years.  It was first invented in the 1930s and found initial acceptance in aircraft manufactured and serviced by the Allied Air Forces during World War II.  Since that time, applications for helical coil inserts have come into broad usage in aerospace, automotive and industrial equipment.  Usage originally included metric spark plus sizes that were delineated in Europe in the 1950s coming into inch using countries in the 1960s.  ASME Subcommittee 29 of the B18 Committee put together the first version of a standard in 1993.  In 2010, ANSI approved of recent revisions and ASME published a revision of B18.29.1 - Helical Coil Screw Thread Inserts - Free Running and Screw Locking (Inch Series).

The '''iron oxide cycle''' (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/FeO) is the original two-step [[thermochemical cycle]] proposed for use for [[hydrogen production]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review06/pd_10_weimer.pdf Project PD10]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is based on the reduction and subsequent oxidation of [[iron]] ions, particularly the reduction and oxidation from Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[Allotropes of iron|ferrites]], or iron oxide, begins in the form of a [[Spinel group|spinel]] and depending on the reaction conditions, dopant metals and support material forms either [[Wüstite]]s or different spinels.

==Process description==
The thermochemical two-step [[water splitting]] process uses two [[redox]] steps. The steps of solar hydrogen production by iron based two-step cycle are:

(1)  M(II)Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(III)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → M(II)O + 2Fe(II)O + ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  (Reduction)

(2) M(II)O + 2Fe(II)O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → M(II)Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(III)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Oxidation)

Where M can by any number of metals, often Fe itself, [[Cobalt|Co]], [[Nickel|Ni]], [[Manganese|Mn]], [[Zinc|Zn]] or [[alloy|mixtures]] thereof. 

The endothermic reduction step (1) is carried out at high temperatures greater than 1400 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, though the "[[Hercynite]] cycle" is capable of temperatures as low as 1200 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. The  oxidative water splitting step (2) occurs at a lower ~1000 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C temperature which produces the original ferrite material in addition to hydrogen gas. The temperature level is realized by using geothermal heat from [[magma]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Analysis_of_Geothermally_Produced_Hydrogen_BigIsland.pdf Sentech 2008-Analysis of geothermally produced hydrogen on the big island of Hawaii]&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[solar power tower]] and a set of [[heliostat]]s to collect the [[solar thermal energy]].

==Hercynite cycle ==
Like the traditional iron oxide cycle, the hercynite is based on the oxidation and reduction of iron atoms. However unlike the traditional cycle, the ferrite material reacts with a second metal oxide, [[aluminum oxide]], rather than simply decomposing. The reactions take place via the following two reactions:

(1)  M(II)Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(III)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; →  M(II)Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(III)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2Fe(II)Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(III)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  (Reduction)

(2)  M(II)Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(III)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2Fe(II)Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(III)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → M(II)Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(III)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Oxidation)

The reduction step of the hercynite reaction takes place at temperature ~ 200 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C lower than the traditional water splitting cycle (1200 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheffe|first=Jonathan|author2=Jianhua Li |author3=Alan W. Weimer |title=A spinel ferrite/hercynite water-splitting redox cycle|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|year=2010|volume=35|issue=8|pages=3333–3340|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319910002387|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.140}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to lower radiation losses, which scale as temperature to the fourth power.

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
The advantages of the ferrite cycles are: they have lower reduction temperatures than other 2-step systems, no metallic gasses are produced, high specific H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production capacity, non-toxicity of the elements used and abundance of the constituent elements.

The disadvantages of the ferrite cycles are: similar reduction and melting temperature of the spinels (except for the hercynite cycle as aluminates have very high melting temperatures), and slow rates of the oxidation, or [[water splitting]], reaction.

The incinerator is located on an old disused [[landfill]] and has a capacity to treat 60,000 tonnes of [[municipal waste]] in addition to [[clinical waste|clinical]] and [[animal by-products|animal waste]]. In order to accomplish this the facility actually incorporates two separate incinerators. The facility uses [[Incineration#Fixed or moving grate combustion|moving grate technology]].

===Bosnian war===

In the military and political circles, Nasir was had reputation to be a practising Muslim who would not compromise on the interests of Islam and Pakistan. In 1992–93, Nasir defied the UN arms embargo placed on [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] when he successfully airlifted the [[Pakistan Ordnance Factories|POF]]'s sophisticated anti-tank guided missiles, which ultimately turned the tide in favour of Bosnian Muslims and forced the Serbs to life the siege much to the annoyance of the [[United States government|U.S. government]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, Cowasjee (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.satribune.com/archives/dec23_29_02/P1_bosniastory.htm |title=Ex-ISI Chief Reveals Secret Missile Shipments to Bosnia defying UN Embargo |date=23 December 2002 |accessdate=1 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108074722/http://www.satribune.com/archives/dec23_29_02/P1_bosniastory.htm |archivedate= 8 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While airlifting sophisticated anti-tank guided missiles to Bosnian Muslims, he pushed the [[Government of Pakistan]] to allow the [[Bosnians in Pakistan|Bosnian immigrationto]] Pakistan.&lt;ref name="sareen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sareen|first=Sushant|title=The jihad factory: Pakistan's Islamic revolution in the making|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|year=2005|pages=352|isbn=978-81-241-1075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] demanded the custody of the former ISI director for his alleged support of the [[Inter-Services Intelligence activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to Muslim fighters of Bosnia against the Serbian army in the 1990s, the Government of Pakistan has refused to hand Nasir to the UN tribunal, citing poor health.

===Removal from the ISI===

In 1993, Lt-Gen.

During this time, the [[Indian government]] led by Prime Minister [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] leveled several accusations on him of supporting the [[Khalistan movement]], the [[Indian Mafia]] and [[Dawood Ibrahim]]– the accusations he swiftly denied in 2008.&lt;ref name="Penguin Books Hussain (2008)"/&gt;{{rp|26–27}} At home, Nasir begin facing accusation from [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] politicians of supporting the conservative Islamic agenda in the country.&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, Cowasjee (2003)" /&gt;

In 1993, the United States formally registered their complaints to Pakistan when U.S. secretary of State [[James Baker]] written a memo to Prime Minister Sharif of putting his country on a terror watch list and was in danger of being listed as terror-supporting nation.&lt;ref name="Penguin Books Hussain (2008)"/&gt;{{rp|27–28}} Responding to the complain, Prime Minister Sharif used diplomacy when he sent his [[Foreign Secretary (Pakistan)|Foreign Secretary]] [[Shahryar Khan]] and [[Pakistani senators|Pakistan Senator]] [[Akram Zaki]] to United States of assuring Pakistan's policy of not supporting the militancy in the region.&lt;ref name="Penguin Books Hussain (2008)"/&gt;{{rp|27–28}}

During this time, several [[Arab countries]] such as [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and the [[Philippines]], lodged a strong protest against Nasir of supporting the radical movements in their respected countries.&lt;ref name="Har-Anand Publications, Sareen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sareen|first1=Sushant|title=The Jihad Factory: Pakistan's Islamic Revolution in the Making|date=2005|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788124110751|pages=216|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uSxZhFenUusC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=Javed+Nasir+arab+countries#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lodhi, PhD|first1=Dr. Maleeha|title=Removal of Javed Nasir|work=The Newsline|agency=The Newsline|publisher=Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, The Newsline|date=14 May 1993|location=Islamabad, Pakistan|language=en-pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the resignations of Prime Minister Sharif and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan|G.I. Khan]] on 18 July 1993, the caretaker Prime Minister [[Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi|M.A. Qureshi]] fired and sacked Nasir from the directorship of the ISI, and [[Acting President of Pakistan|Acting President]] [[Wasim Sajjad]] approved his premature retirement from his [[Commissioned officer|military commission]] effective from on 13 May 1993&lt;ref name="Anmol Publications, Joshi (2008)"/&gt;{{rp|170}}— he only led the ISI for 13 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian Bulletin|date=1993|publisher=APACL Publications|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lkknAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Javed+Nasir+arab+countries&amp;q=Javed+Nasir |page=44 |accessdate=15 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68326">'''[[Bamboo]]''' {{Audio|En-us-bamboo.ogg|listen}} is a group of [[wood]]y [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[grass]]es in the [[true grass]] family [[Poaceae]], which is a large family with over 10,000 species. In the tribe ''[[Bambuseae]]'' also known as bamboo, there are 91 [[genera]] and over 1,000 [[species]]. The size of bamboo varies from small annuals to giant timber bamboo.  Bamboo evolved only 30 to 40 million years ago, after the demise of the dinosaurs. Bamboo is the fastest-growing woody plant in the world. It can grow up to 91–122 centimetres/day (3.8-5.0 centimetres/hr).&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, W.P. [http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph39.htm "Bamboo: Remarkable Giant Grasses".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027064422/http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph39.htm |date=2014-10-27 }} Wayne's Word. Accessed January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamboo species can be divided into clumpers and runners.  Clumpers grow from the soil in a slowly expanding tuft.  Runners send underground rhizomes to produce shoots several metres from the parent plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bamboo.org/GeneralInfoPages/RunnersAndClumpers.html American Bamboo Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

All Chinese names for bamboo contain the character "[[竹]]". This character by itself simply means bamboo, however it enters into hundreds of other words and phrases. "Every day our written language reminds us of the antiquity of China's partnership with bamboo." (Dr. W. Y. Hsiung). This character, pronounced ''zhu'' depicts two leafed twigs of bamboo. The radical 竹 also indicates "sense".&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic October 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''luminophore''' is an [[atom]] or [[functional group]] in a [[chemical compound]] that is responsible for its [[luminescence|luminescent]] properties.&lt;ref name="Kricka2003"/&gt; Luminophores can be either organic&lt;ref name="OrganicLuminophores"/&gt; or inorganic.

Luminophores can be further classified as [[fluorophore]]s or [[phosphor]]s, depending on the nature of the [[excited state]] responsible for the emission of [[photon]]s. However, some luminophores cannot be classified as being exclusively fluorophores or phosphors. Examples include [[transition-metal]] complexes such as [[tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride]], whose luminescence comes from an excited (nominally triplet) metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) state, which is not a true triplet state in the strict sense of the definition; and colloidal [[quantum dots]], whose emissive state does not have either a purely singlet or triplet spin.

Most luminophores consist of [[conjugated system|conjugated π systems]] or transition-metal complexes. There are also purely inorganic luminophores, such as [[zinc sulfide]] doped with [[rare-earth metal]] ions, rare-earth metal oxysulfides doped with other rare-earth metal ions, [[yttrium oxide]] doped with rare-earth metal ions, [[zinc orthosilicate]] doped with manganese ions, etc. Luminophores can be observed in action in fluorescent lights, television screens, computer monitor screens, [[organic light-emitting diode]]s and [[bioluminescence]].

The correct, textbook terminology is ''luminophore'', not ''lumophore'', although the latter term has been frequently used in the chemical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/705355252|title=Bioinorganic medicinal chemistry|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-VCH|others=Alessio, E.

'''Mechanochromic luminescence (ML)''' references to intensity and/or color changes of (solid-state) [[Luminescence|luminescent materials]] induced by mechanical forces, such as rubbing, crushing, pressing, shearing, or smearing. Unlike "[[triboluminescence]]" which does not require additional excitation source other than force itself, ML is often manifested by external [[photoexcitation]] such as a [[Ultraviolet|UV]] lamp. The most common cause of ML is related to changes of intermolecular interactions of [[dye]]s and [[pigment]]s, which gives rise to various strong ([[exciton]] splitting) and/or weak ([[Forster-Decker method|Forster]]) excited state interactions. For example, a certain [[boron]] complex of [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja9097719 sunscreen compound] [[avobenzone]] exhibits reversible ML. A [http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/JM/c2jm32809g recent detailed study]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Xingxing|last2=Zhang|first2=Xuepeng|last3=Li|first3=Xinyang|last4=Liu|first4=Shiyong|last5=Zhang|first5=Guoqing|date=2012-07-31|title=A mechanistic investigation of mechanochromic luminescent organoboron materials|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c2jm32809g|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry|language=en|volume=22|issue=33|doi=10.1039/c2jm32809g|issn=1364-5501}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that ML from the boron complex consists of two critical coupled steps: 1) generation of low energy [[exciton]] trap via [[mechanical system|mechanical]] perturbation; and 2) exciton migration from regions where [[photoexcitation]] results in a higher [[excited state]]. Since solid-state [[energy transfer]] can be very efficient, only a small fraction of the low-energy [[exciton]] traps is required when mechanical force is applied. As a result, for crystalline ML materials, [[X-ray Diffraction|XRD]] measurement may not able to detect changes before and after mechanical [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] while its [[photoluminescence]] can be quite different.

MFCs can be grouped into two general categories: mediated and unmediated. The first MFCs, demonstrated in the early 20th century, used a mediator: a chemical that transfers electrons from the bacteria in the cell to the anode. Unmediated MFCs emerged in the 1970s; in this type of MFC the bacteria typically have electrochemically active [[redox]] [[protein]]s such as [[cytochromes]] on their outer membrane that can transfer electrons directly to the anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fchem.2014.00079 |title=Emerging electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies |journal=Frontiers in Chemistry |volume=2 |year=2014 |last1=Badwal |first1=Sukhvinder P.

==History==
The idea of using microbes to produce [[electricity]] was conceived in the early twentieth century. M. C. Potter initiated the subject in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1911.0073 |jstor=80609 |title=Electrical Effects Accompanying the Decomposition of Organic Compounds |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=84 |issue=571 |pages=260–76 |year=1911 |last1=Potter |first1=M. C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potter managed to generate electricity from ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', but the work received little coverage. In 1931, Branet Cohen created microbial [[Half-cell|half]] [[fuel cell]]s that, when connected in series, were capable of producing over 35 volts with only a current of 2 [[milliamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = B | year = 1931 | title = The Bacterial Culture as an Electrical Half-Cell | url = | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 18–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by DelDuca et al. used hydrogen produced by the [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of glucose by ''[[Clostridium butyricum]]'' as the reactant at the anode of a hydrogen and air fuel cell. Though the cell functioned, it was unreliable owing to the unstable nature of hydrogen production by the micro-organisms.&lt;ref&gt;DelDuca, M. G., Friscoe, J. M. and Zurilla, R. W. (1963). Developments in Industrial Microbiology. ''American Institute of Biological Sciences'', 4, pp81–84.&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was resolved by Suzuki et al. in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karube | first1 = I. | last2 = Matasunga | first2 = T. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = S. | last4 = Tsuru | first4 = S. | year = 1976 | title = Continuous hydrogen production by immobilized whole cels of ''Clostridium butyricum'' | url = | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 338–343 | doi=10.1016/0304-4165(76)90376-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who produced a successful MFC design a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Isao |last1=Karube |first2=Tadashi |last2=Matsunaga |first3=Shinya |last3=Tsuru |first4=Shuichi |last4=Suzuki |date=November 1977 |title=Biochemical cells utilizing immobilized cells of ''Clostridium butyricum'' |journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering |volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=1727–1733 |doi=10.1002/bit.260191112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s little was understood about how microbial fuel cells functioned. The idea was studied by Robin M. Allen and later by H. Peter Bennetto. People saw the fuel cell as a possible method for the generation of electricity for developing countries. Bennetto's work, starting in the early 1980s, helped build an understanding of how fuel cells operate and he was seen by many{{Who|date=April 2011}} as the topic's foremost authority.

In May 2007, the [[University of Queensland]], Australia completed a prototype MFC as a cooperative effort with [[Foster's Group|Foster's Brewing]]. The prototype, a 10 L design, converted [[brewery wastewater]] into carbon dioxide, clean water and electricity. The group had plans to create a pilot-scale model for an upcoming international bio-energy conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brewing a sustainable energy solution|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2007/05/brewing-sustainable-energy-solution|website=The University of Queensland Australia|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a device that [[energy conversion|converts]] [[chemical energy]] to [[electrical energy]] by the action of [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=R.M. |last2=Bennetto |first2=H.P. |year=1993 |title=Microbial fuel cells: Electricity production from carbohydrates |journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology |volume=39–40 |pages=27–40 |doi=10.1007/bf02918975}}&lt;/ref&gt; These electrochemical cells are constructed using either a bioanode and/or a biocathode. Most MFCs contain a membrane to separate the compartments of the anode (where oxidation takes place) and the cathode (where reduction takes place). The electrons produced during oxidation are transferred directly to an electrode or, to a [[redox]] mediator species. The electron flux is moved to the cathode. The charge balance of the system is compensated by ionic movement inside the cell, usually across an iconic membrane. Most MFCs use an organic [[electron donor]] that is oxidized to produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, protons and electrons. Other electron donors have been reported, such as sulphur compounds or hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pant | first1 = D. | last2 = Van Bogaert | first2 = G. | last3 = Diels | first3 = L. | last4 = Vanbroekhoven | first4 = K. | year = 2010 | title = A review of the substrates used in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for sustainable energy production | url = | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 101 | issue = 6| pages = 1533–43 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2009.10.017 | pmid=19892549}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathode reaction uses a variety of electron acceptors that includes the reduction of oxygen as the most studied process. However, other electron acceptors have been studied, including metal recovery by reduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lu | first1 = Z. | last2 = Chang | first2 = D. | last3 = Ma | first3 = J. | last4 = Huang | first4 = G. | last5 = Cai | first5 = L. | last6 = Zhang | first6 = L. | year = 2015 | title = Behavior of metal ions in bioelectrochemical systems: A review | url = | journal = Journal of Power Sources | volume = 275 | issue = | pages = 243–260 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; water to hydrogen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oh | first1 = S. | last2 = Logan | first2 = B.

== Applications ==

===Power generation===
MFCs are attractive for power generation applications that require only low power, but where replacing batteries may be impractical, such as wireless sensor networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36365-8_6|title=Wireless Sensor Networks and Ecological Monitoring|volume=3|publisher=Springer link|year=2013|isbn=978-3-642-36365-8|pages=151–178|author1=Subhas C Mukhopadhyay|author2=Joe-Air Jiang|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-36365-8_6|chapter=Application of Microbial Fuel Cells to Power Sensor Networks for Ecological Monitoring|series=Smart Sensors, Measurement and Instrumentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2013.12.078 |pmid=24434696 |title=A stable synergistic microbial consortium for simultaneous azo dye removal and bioelectricity generation |journal=Bioresource Technology |volume=155 |pages=71–6 |year=2014 |last1=Wang |first1=Victor Bochuan |last2=Chua |first2=Song-Lin |last3=Cai |first3=Zhao |last4=Sivakumar |first4=Krishnakumar |last5=Zhang |first5=Qichun |last6=Kjelleberg |first6=Staffan |last7=Cao |first7=Bin |last8=Loo |first8=Say Chye Joachim |last9=Yang |first9=Liang }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0063129 |pmid=23700414 |pmc=3659106 |title=Engineering PQS Biosynthesis Pathway for Enhancement of Bioelectricity Production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Microbial Fuel Cells |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=e63129 |year=2013 |last1=Wang |first1=Victor Bochuan |last2=Chua |first2=Song-Lin |last3=Cao |first3=Bin |last4=Seviour |first4=Thomas |last5=Nesatyy |first5=Victor J |last6=Marsili |first6=Enrico |last7=Kjelleberg |first7=Staffan |last8=Givskov |first8=Michael |last9=Tolker-Nielsen |first9=Tim |last10=Song |first10=Hao |last11=Loo |first11=Joachim Say Chye |last12=Yang |first12=Liang }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, an MFC is capable of energy efficiency far beyond 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Yue &amp; Lowther, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Rozendal obtained energy conversion to hydrogen 8 times that of conventional hydrogen production technologies.

However; MFCs can also work at a smaller scale. Electrodes in some cases need only be 7 μm thick by 2&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Barton|first2=S.C.|last3=Binyamin|first3=G.|last4=Gao|first4=Z.|last5=Zhang|first5=Y.|last6=Kim|first6=H.-H.|last7=Heller|first7=A.|date=Sep 2001|title=A miniature biofuel cell.|journal=J Am Chem Soc|volume=123|issue=35|pages=8630–1|doi=10.1021/ja0163164|pmid=11525685|last1=Chen|first1=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that an MFC can replace a battery. It provides a renewable form of energy and does not need to be recharged.

MFCs operate well in mild conditions, 20&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C and also at [[pH]] of around 7.&lt;ref name="pmid16569499"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Biofuel cells and their development.|journal=Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics|volume=21|issue=11|pages=2015–45|doi=10.1016/j.bios.2006.01.030|pmid=16569499|vauthors=Bullen RA, Arnot TC, Lakeman JB, Walsh FC}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lack the stability required for long-term medical applications such as in [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]].

Power stations can be based on aquatic plants such as algae. If sited adjacent to an existing power system, the MFC system can share its electricity lines.&lt;ref&gt;Eos magazine, Waterstof uit het riool, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Soil-based microbial fuel cells serve as educational tools, as they encompass multiple  scientific disciplines (microbiology, geochemistry, electrical engineering, etc.) and can be made using commonly available materials, such as soils and items from the refrigerator. Kits for home science projects and classrooms are available.&lt;ref name="MudWatt" /&gt; One example of microbial fuel cells being used in the classroom is in the IBET (Integrated Biology, English, and Technology) curriculum for [[Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology]]. Several educational videos and articles are also available on the '''International Society for Microbial Electrochemistry and Technology''' (ISMET Society)"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.is-met.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;".

===Biosensor===
{{Main|Biosensor}}

The current generated from a microbial fuel cell is directly proportional to the energy content of wastewater used as the fuel. MFCs can measure the solute concentration of wastewater (i.e., as a [[biosensor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Chang|first2=IS.|last3=Gil|first3=GC.|last4=Park|first4=HS.|last5=Kim|first5=HJ.|date=April 2003|title=Novel BOD (biological oxygen demand) sensor using mediator-less microbial fuel cell|journal=Biotechnology Letters|volume=25|issue=7|pages=541–545|doi=10.1023/A:1022891231369|last1=Kim|first1=BH.|pmid=12882142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wastewater is commonly assessed for its [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) values.{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} BOD values are determined by incubating samples for 5 days with proper source of microbes, usually activated sludge collected from wastewater plants.

An MFC-type BOD sensor can provide real-time BOD values. Oxygen and nitrate are preferred electron acceptors over the electrode, reducing current generation from an MFC. MFC BOD sensors underestimate BOD values in the presence of these electron acceptors. This can be avoided by inhibiting aerobic and nitrate respiration in the MFC using terminal oxidase inhibitors such as [[cyanide]] and [[azide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bios.2004.06.003 |pmid=15681205 |title=Improvement of a microbial fuel cell performance as a BOD sensor using respiratory inhibitors |journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=1856–9 |year=2005 |last1=Chang |first1=In Seop |last2=Moon |first2=Hyunsoo |last3=Jang |first3=Jae Kyung |last4=Kim |first4=Byung Hong }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such BOD sensors are commercially available.

The [[United States Navy]] is considering microbial fuel cells for environmental sensors. The use of microbial fuel cells to power environmental sensors would be able to provide power for longer periods and enable the collection and retrieval of undersea data without a wired infrastructure. The energy created by these fuel cells is enough to sustain the sensors after an initial startup time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Benthic Microbial Fuel Cell as Direct Power Source for an Acoustic Modem and Seawater Oxygen/Temperature Sensor System|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|volume=45|issue=11|pages=5047–53|doi=10.1021/es104383q|pmid=21545151|author=Gong, Y., Radachowsky, S. E., Wolf, M., Nielsen, M. E., Girguis, P. R., &amp; Reimers, C. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to undersea conditions (high salt concentrations, fluctuating temperatures and limited nutrient supply), the Navy may deploy MFCs with a mixture of salt-tolerant microorganisms. A mixture would allow for a more complete utilization of available nutrients. ''[[Shewanella oneidensis]]'' is their primary candidate, but may include other heat- and cold-tolerant ''Shewanella spp''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Aerobic Miniature Microbial Fuel Cells|journal=NRL Review|pages=141–42|author=Biffinger, J.C., Little, B., Pietron, J., Ray, R., Ringeisen, B.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A first self-powered and autonomous BOD/COD biosensor has been developed and allows to detect organic contaminants in freshwater. The senor relies only on power produced by MFCs and operates continuously without maintenance. The biosensor turns on the alarm to inform about contamination level: the increased frequency of the signal informs about higher contamination level, while low frequency warns about low contamination level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-01|title=Self-powered, autonomous Biological Oxygen Demand biosensor for online water quality monitoring|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400517300199|journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical|language=en|volume=244|pages=815–822|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2017.01.019|issn=0925-4005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biorecovery===
In 2010, A. ter Heijne et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es100526g |title=Copper Recovery Combined with Electricity Production in a Microbial Fuel Cell |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=4376–81 |year=2010 |last1=Heijne |first1=Annemiek Ter |last2=Liu |first2=Fei |last3=Weijden |first3=Renata van der |last4=Weijma |first4=Jan |last5=Buisman |first5=Cees J.N |last6=Hamelers |first6=Hubertus V.M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  constructed a device capable of producing electricity and reducing Cu (II) (ion) to copper metal.

Microbial electrolysis cells have been demonstrated to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00253-012-4456-7 |pmid=23053105 |title=Production of hydrogen from domestic wastewater in a pilot-scale microbial electrolysis cell |journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume=97 |issue=15 |pages=6979–89 |year=2012 |last1=Heidrich |first1=E.

===Wastewater treatment===

MFCs are used in water treatment to harvest energy utilizing [[anaerobic digestion]]. The process can also reduce pathogens. However, it requires temperatures upwards of 30 degrees C and requires an extra step in order to convert [[biogas]] to electricity. Spiral spacers may be used to increase electricity generation by creating a helical flow in the MFC. Scaling MFCs is a challenge because of the power output challenges of a larger surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Using Microbial Fuel Cells to Treat Raw Sludge and Primary Effluent for Bioelectricity Generation|journal=Department of Civil Engineering and Mechanics; University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee|author=Zhang, Fei, He, Zhen, Ge, Zheng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Mediated===
Most microbial cells are electrochemically inactive. Electron transfer from microbial cells to the [[electrode]] is facilitated by mediators such as [[thionin]]e, [[methyl viologen]], [[methyl blue]], [[humic acid]] and [[neutral red]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Mediator-free ===

Mediator-free microbial fuel cells use electrochemically active bacteria to transfer electrons to the electrode (electrons are carried directly from the bacterial respiratory enzyme to the electrode). Among the electrochemically active bacteria are ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = B.H. | last2 = Kim | first2 = H.J. | last3 = Hyun | first3 = M.S. | last4 = Park | first4 = D.H. | year = 1999a | title = ''Direct electrode reaction of Fe (III) reducing bacterium, ''Shewanella putrefacience | url = http://bioelectrochemistry.kist.re.kr/downloads/pdf/1-5.pdf | format = PDF | journal = J Microbiol Biotechnol | volume = 9 | issue =  | pages = 127–131 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040908164327/http://bioelectrochemistry.kist.re.kr/downloads/pdf/1-5.pdf | archivedate = 2004-09-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Aeromonas hydrophila]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Some bacteria are able to transfer their electron production via the [[Pilus|pili]] on their external membrane. Mediator-free MFCs are less well characterized, such as the [[strain (biology)|strain]] of bacteria used in the system, type of [[ion-exchange membrane]] and system conditions (temperature, pH, etc.)

Mediator-free microbial fuel cells can run on [[wastewater]] and derive energy directly from certain plants. This configuration is known as a plant microbial fuel cell.  Possible plants include [[Glyceria maxima|reed sweetgrass]], [[Spartina|cordgrass]], rice, tomatoes, [[Lupinus|lupines]] and [[algae]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantpower.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=4 Mediator-less microbial fuel cell schematic + explanation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310220311/http://www.plantpower.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=4 |date=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ete.wur.nl/UK/Research/Renewable+Energy/Green+electricity+production+by+living+plants+in+a+microbial+fuel+cell/|title=Environmental Technology|work=Wageningen UR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/er.1397 |title=Green electricity production with living plants and bacteria in a fuel cell |journal=[[International Journal of Energy Research]] |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=870–6 |year=2008 |last1=Strik |first1=David P.

===Microbial electrolysis ===
{{Main|Microbial electrolysis cell}}
One variation of the mediator-less MFC is the microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). While MFCs produce electric current by the bacterial decomposition of organic compounds in water, MECs partially reverse the process to generate hydrogen or methane by applying a voltage to bacteria. This supplements the voltage generated by the microbial decomposition of organics, leading to the [[electrolysis of water]] or methane production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awmc.uq.edu.au/index.html?page=84198|title=Advanced Water Management Centre|work=Advanced Water Management Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Microbial+Hydrogen+Production+Threatens+Extinction+for+the+Ethanol+Dinosaur/article9278.htm|title=DailyTech - Microbial Hydrogen Production Threatens Extinction for the Ethanol Dinosaur|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete reversal of the MFC principle is found in [[microbial electrosynthesis]], in which [[carbon dioxide]] is reduced by bacteria using an external electric current to form multi-carbon organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://mbio.asm.org/content/1/2/e00103-10.full |title=Microbial Electrosynthesis: Feeding Microbes Electricity To Convert Carbon Dioxide and Water to Multicarbon Extracellular Organic Compounds |doi=10.1128/mBio.00103-10 |date=May–June 2010 |author1=Nevin Kelly P. |author2=Woodard Trevor L. |author3=Franks Ashley E. |journal=MBio |volume=1 |issue=2|display-authors=etal |pages=e00103–10 |pmid=20714445 |pmc=2921159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil-based===
[[File:SoilMFC.png|thumb|right|150px|A soil-based MFC]]
[[Soil]]-based microbial fuel cells adhere to the basic MFC principles, whereby soil acts as the nutrient-rich anodic media, the [[inoculum]] and the [[proton exchange membrane]] (PEM).  The [[anode]] is placed at a particular depth within the soil, while the [[cathode]] rests on top the soil and is exposed to air.

Soils naturally [[soil biology|teem with diverse microbes]], including electrogenic bacteria needed for MFCs, and are full of complex sugars and other nutrients that have accumulated from plant and animal material decay.  Moreover, the [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] (oxygen consuming) microbes present in the soil act as an oxygen filter, much like the expensive PEM materials used in laboratory MFC systems, which cause the [[redox]] potential of the soil to decrease with greater depth.  Soil-based MFCs are becoming popular educational tools for science classrooms.&lt;ref name="MudWatt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicalmicrobes.com/collections/kits/products/mudwatt-clean-energy-from-mud|title=MudWatt Science Kit|author=MudWatt|work=MudWatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) have been applied for [[wastewater treatment]]. Simple SMFCs can generate energy while decontaminating [[wastewater]]. Most such SMFCs contain plants to mimic constructed wetlands. By 2015 SMFC tests had reached more than 150 l.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C5EW00020C |title=Sediment microbial fuel cells for wastewater treatment: Challenges and opportunities |journal=Environmental Science: Water Research &amp; Technology |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=279–84 |year=2015 |last1=Xu |first1=Bojun |last2=Ge |first2=Zheng |last3=He |first3=Zhen |url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/10919/64969/1/2015_Xu_Sediment_microbial_fuel_cells_for_wast.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 researchers announced an SMFC application that extracts energy and charges a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Salts dissociate into positively and negatively charged ions in water and move and adhere to the respective negative and positive electrodes, charging the battery and making it possible to remove the salt effecting ''microbial capacitive [[desalination]]''. The microbes produce more energy than is required for the desalination process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cleaning up wastewater from oil and gas operations using a microbe-powered battery |first= Helen |last=Clark |date=March 2, 2015 |publisher=Gizmag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phototrophic biofilm===
Phototrophic biofilm MFCs (ner) use a phototrophic [[biofilm]] anode containing photosynthetic microorganism such as [[chlorophyta]],[[Cyanobacteria|candyanophyta]].They carry out photosynthesis and thus produce organic metabolites and donate electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that PBMFCs display a [[power density]] sufficient for practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2010.10.001 |pmid=21067833 |title=Microbial solar cells: Applying photosynthetic and electrochemically active organisms |journal=Trends in Biotechnology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=41–9 |year=2011 |last1=Strik |first1=David P.B.T.B |last2=Timmers |first2=Ruud A |last3=Helder |first3=Marjolein |last4=Steinbusch |first4=Kirsten J.J |last5=Hamelers |first5=Hubertus V.M |last6=Buisman |first6=Cees J.N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sub-category of phototrophic MFCs that use purely oxygenic photosynthetic material at the anode are sometimes called [[biological photovoltaics|biological photovoltaic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/c1ee02531g |title=Quantitative analysis of the factors limiting solar power transduction by Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in biological photovoltaic devices |journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=4690–8 |year=2011 |last1=Bombelli |first1=Paolo |last2=Bradley |first2=Robert W |last3=Scott |first3=Amanda M |last4=Philips |first4=Alexander J |last5=McCormick |first5=Alistair J |last6=Cruz |first6=Sonia M |last7=Anderson |first7=Alexander |last8=Yunus |first8=Kamran |last9=Bendall |first9=Derek S |last10=Cameron |first10=Petra J |last11=Davies |first11=Julia M |last12=Smith |first12=Alison G |last13=Howe |first13=Christopher J |last14=Fisher |first14=Adrian C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanoporous membrane===
The [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] developed nanoporous membrane microbial fuel cells that use a non-PEM to generate passive diffusion within the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/techtransfer/available-technologies/energy/miniature-microbial-fuel-cells |title=Miniature Microbial Fuel Cells |website=Technology Transfer Office |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membrane is a nonporous polymer filter ([[nylon]], [[cellulose]], or [[polycarbonate]]). It offers comparable power densities to [[Nafion]] (a well known PEM) with greater durability. Porous membranes allow passive diffusion thereby reducing the necessary power supplied to the MFC in order to keep the PEM active and increasing the total energy output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Biffinger |first=Justin C. |last2=Ray |first2=Ricky |last3=Little |first3=Brenda |last4=Ringeisen |first4=Bradley R. |year=2007 |title=Diversifying Biological Fuel Cell Design by Use of Nanoporous Filters |journal=Environmental Science and Technology |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=1444–49 |doi=10.1021/es061634u }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MFCs that do not use a membrane can deploy anaerobic bacteria in aerobic environments. However, membrane-less MFCs experience cathode contamination by the indigenous bacteria and the power-supplying microbe. The novel passive diffusion of nanoporous membranes can achieve the benefits of a membrane-less MFC without worry of cathode contamination.

Nanoporous membranes are also eleven times cheaper than Nafion (Nafion-117, $0.22/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vs. polycarbonate, &lt;$0.02/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/ShabeebaVAnthru/seminar-2-56681944|title=Seminar 2|last=Shabeeba|first=Anthru|date=5 Jan 2016|website=Slide Share|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceramic membrane===
PEM membranes can be replaced with ceramic materials. [[Ceramic membrane]] costs can be as low as $5.66 /m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The macroporous structure of ceramic membranes allows good transport of ionic species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cssc.201501320 |pmid=26692569 |pmc=4744959 |title=Comprehensive Study on Ceramic Membranes for Low-Cost Microbial Fuel Cells |journal=ChemSusChem |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=88–96 |year=2016 |last1=Pasternak |first1=Grzegorz |last2=Greenman |first2=John |last3=Ieropoulos |first3=Ioannis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials that have been successfully employed in ceramic MFCs are [[earthenware]], [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]], [[mullite]], [[pyrophyllite]] and [[terracotta]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2009.07.089 |pmid=19800223 |title=Performance evaluation of low cost microbial fuel cell fabricated using earthen pot with biotic and abiotic cathode |journal=Bioresource Technology |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=1183–9 |year=2010 |last1=Behera |first1=Manaswini |last2=Jana |first2=Partha S |last3=Ghangrekar |first3=M.M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00449-013-0967-6 |pmid=23728836 |title=Comparing terracotta and earthenware for multiple functionalities in microbial fuel cells |journal=Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=1913–21 |year=2013 |last1=Winfield |first1=Jonathan |last2=Greenman |first2=John |last3=Huson |first3=David |last4=Ieropoulos |first4=Ioannis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generation process==
When microorganisms consume a substance such as [[sugar]] in aerobic conditions, they produce [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]]. However, when [[oxygen]] is not present, they produce carbon dioxide, [[proton]]s[[Hydrogen ion|/hydrogen ions]] and [[electron]]s, as described below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/protocols/PRACBIOTECH/PDF/bennetto.pdf |last=Bennetto |first=H. P. |year=1990 |title=Electricity Generation by Micro-organisms |journal=Biotechnology Education |volume=1 |number=4 |pages=163–168}}&lt;!-- multiple other PDF sources available as of July 2012; search Google Scholar if this link dies --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + 13H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 12CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 48H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 48e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  (''Eqt. 1'')

Microbial fuel cells use [[inorganic]] mediators to tap into the [[electron transport chain]] of cells and channel electrons produced. The mediator crosses the outer cell [[lipid membranes]] and [[bacterial outer membrane]]; then, it begins to liberate electrons from the electron transport chain that normally would be taken up by oxygen or other intermediates.

The now-reduced mediator exits the cell laden with electrons that it transfers to an electrode; this electrode becomes the anode. The release of the electrons recycles the mediator to its original oxidised state, ready to repeat the process. '''This can happen only under anaerobic conditions'''; if oxygen is present, it will collect the electrons, as it has greater [[electronegativity]].

In MFC operation, the anode is the terminal electron acceptor recognized by bacteria in the anodic chamber. Therefore, the microbial activity is strongly dependent on the anode's redox potential. A [[Michaelis-Menten]] curve was obtained between the anodic potential and the power output of an [[acetate]]-driven MFC. A critical anodic potential seems to provide maximum power output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es8003969 |pmid=18546730 |title=Affinity of Microbial Fuel Cell Biofilm for the Anodic Potential |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=3828–34 |year=2008 |last1=Cheng |first1=Ka Yu |last2=Ho |first2=Goen |last3=Cord-Ruwisch |first3=Ralf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potential mediators include natural red, methylene blue, thionine and resorufin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bit.260250219 |pmid=18548670 |title=Anodic reactions in microbial fuel cells |journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=559–68 |year=1983 |last1=Bennetto |first1=H. Peter |last2=Stirling |first2=John L |last3=Tanaka |first3=Kazuko |last4=Vega |first4=Carmen A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms capable of producing an electric current are termed [[exoelectrogen]]s. In order to turn this current into usable electricity, exoelectrogens have to be accommodated in a fuel cell.

The mediator and a micro-organism such as yeast, are mixed together in a solution to which is added a substrate such as [[glucose]]. This mixture is placed in a sealed chamber to stop oxygen entering, thus forcing the micro-organism to undertake [[anaerobic respiration]]. An electrode is placed in the solution to act as the anode.

In the second chamber of the MFC is another solution and the positively charged cathode. It is the equivalent of the oxygen sink at the end of the electron transport chain, external to the biological cell. The solution is an [[oxidizing agent]] that picks up the electrons at the cathode. As with the electron chain in the yeast cell, this could be a variety of molecules such as oxygen, although a more convenient option is a solid oxidizing agent, which requires less volume.

Connecting the two electrodes is a wire (or other electrically conductive path). Completing the circuit and connecting the two chambers is a salt bridge or ion-exchange membrane. This last feature allows the protons produced, as described in ''Eqt. 1,'' to pass from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber.

The reduced mediator carries electrons from the cell to the electrode. Here the mediator is oxidized as it deposits the electrons. These then flow across the wire to the second electrode, which acts as an electron sink. From here they pass to an oxidizing material. Also the hydrogen ions/protons are moved from the anode to the cathode via a proton exchange membrane such as [[nafion]]. They will move across to the lower concentration gradient and be combined with the oxygen but to do this they need an electron. This forms current and the hydrogen is used sustaining the concentration gradient.

Algae Biomass has been observed to give high energy when used as substrates in microbial fuel cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.067 |pmid=23584037 |title=Enhanced electricity generation by using algae biomass and activated sludge in microbial fuel cell |journal=Science of the Total Environment |volume=456-457 |pages=91–4 |year=2013 |last1=Rashid |first1=Naim |last2=Cui |first2=Yu-Feng |last3=Saif Ur Rehman |first3=Muhammad |last4=Han |first4=Jong-In }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20019">'''Micromechanics''' (or, more precisely, micromechanics of materials) is the analysis of [[Composite material|composite]] or [[heterogeneous]] materials on the level of the individual constituents that constitute these materials.

== Aims of micromechanics of materials ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
Heterogeneous materials, such as [[Composite material|composites]], solid [[foam]]s, [[polycrystals]], or [[bone]], consist of clearly distinguishable constituents (or ''phases'') that show different mechanical and physical [[Material properties (thermodynamics)|material properties]]. While the constituents can often be modeled through an [[Isotropy|isotropic]] behaviour, the [[microstructure]] characteristics (shape, orientation, varying volume fraction, ..) of heterogeneous material often leads to an [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] behaviour.

Anisotropic material models are available for [[linear]] [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. In the [[nonlinear]] regime, the modeling is often restricted to [[orthotropic material]] models which does not capture the physics for all heterogeneous materials. Micromechanics goal is to predict the anisotropic response of the heterogeneous material on the basis of the geometries and properties of the individual phases, a task known as homogenization.&lt;ref&gt;S. Nemat-Nasser and M. Hori, Micromechanics: Overall Properties of Heterogeneous Materials, Second Edition, North-Holland, 1999, {{ISBN|0444500847}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of micromechanics is that it allows to predict multi-axial properties that are often difficult to measure experimentally. A typical example is the out-of-plane properties for unidirectional composites.

The main advantage of micromechanics is to perform virtual testing in order to reduce the cost of an experimental campaign. Indeed, an experimental campaign of heterogeneous material is often expensive and involve a larger number of permutations : constituent material combinations; fiber and particle volume fractions; fiber and particle arrangements; and processing histories). Once the constituents properties are known, all these permutations can be simulated through virtual testing using micromechanics.

There is several ways to obtain the material properties of each constituents : by identifying the behaviour based on [[molecular dynamics]] simulation results; by identifying the behaviour through an experimental campaign on each constituents; by reverse engineering the properties through a reduced experimental campaign on the heterogeneous material. The latter option is typically used since some constituents are difficult to test, there is always some uncertainties on the real microstructure and it allows to take into account the weakness of the micromechanics approach into the constituents material properties. The obtained material models need to be validated through comparison with a different set of experimental data than the one use for the reverse engineering.

== Generality on micromechanics ==

The key point of micromechanics of materials is the localization, which aims at evaluating the local ([[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]]) fields in the phases for given macroscopic load states, phase properties, and phase geometries. Such knowledge is especially important in understanding and describing material damage and failure.

Because most heterogeneous materials show a statistical rather than a deterministic arrangement of the constituents, the methods of micromechanics are typically based on the concept of the [[representative volume element]] (RVE). An RVE is understood to be a sub-volume of an inhomogeneous medium that is of sufficient size for providing all geometrical information necessary for obtaining an appropriate homogenized behavior.

Most methods in micromechanics of materials are based on [[continuum mechanics]] rather than on atomistic approaches such as [[nanomechanics]] or [[molecular dynamics]]. In addition to the mechanical responses of inhomogeneous materials, their [[Heat conduction|thermal conduction]] behavior and related problems can be studied with analytical and numerical continuum methods. All these approaches may be subsumed under the name of "continuum micromechanics".

=== Methods based on [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA) ===
Most such micromechanical methods use [[Periodic function|periodic]] [[Homogenization (mathematics)|homogenization]], which approximates [[Composite material|composites]] by periodic phase arrangements. A single repeating volume element is studied, appropriate [[boundary conditions]] being applied to extract the composite's macroscopic properties or responses.

In addition to studying periodic [[microstructures]], embedding models&lt;ref name="gonzalez07"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=González C. |author2=LLorca J. |title=Virtual Fracture Testing of Composites: A Computational Micromechanics Approach|journal=Eng.

Due to its high flexibility and efficiency, FEA at present is the most widely used numerical tool in continuum micromechanics. Examples of the practical use of FEA in micromechanics can be found in many disciplines including biomaterials ([[bone]],&lt;ref name="levrero16"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levrero | first1 = F. | last2 = Margetts | first2 = L. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2016 | title = Evaluating the macroscopic yield behaviour of trabecular bone using a nonlinear homogenisation approach | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301307704_Evaluating_the_macroscopic_yield_behaviour_of_trabecular_bone_using_a_nonlinear_homogenisation_approach | journal = Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials | volume = 61| issue = | pages = 384–396| doi = 10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tendon]]&lt;ref name="rawson15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = S.D. | last2 = Margetts | first2 = L. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2015 | title = Sutured tendon repair: A multi-scale finite element model | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262529587_Sutured_tendon_repair_a_multi-scale_finite_element_model | journal = Journal of Biomechanics and Modelling in Mechanobiology | volume = 14| issue = 1| pages = 123–133| doi = 10.1007/s10237-014-0593-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), construction materials ([[concrete]]&lt;ref name="qsymah16"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qsymah | first1 = A. | last2 = Sharma | first2 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2017 | title = Micro X-ray computed tomography image-based two-scale homogenisation of ultra high performance fibre reinforced concrete | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309133981_Micro_X-ray_Computed_Tomography_Image-based_Two-scale_Homogenisation_of_Ultra_High_Performance_Fibre_Reinforced_Concrete | journal = Journal of Construction and Building Materials | volume = 130| issue = | pages = 230–240| doi = 10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.09.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and engineering materials ([[composite material|composite]]

Parallel finite element programs such as [http://parafem.org.uk/ ParaFEM] have enabled researchers to study very large volume elements derived from 3D tomography data.&lt;ref name="levrero16" /&gt; |

A unified theory called mechanics of structure genome (MSG) has been introduced to treat structural modeling of anisotropic heterogeneous structures as special applications of micromechanics.&lt;ref name="yu2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yu W.|title=A Unified Theory for Constitutive Modeling of Composites|journal=Journal of Mechanics of Materials and Structures|volume=11|pages=379–411|year=2016|doi=10.2140/jomms.2016.11.379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using MSG, it is possible to directly compute structural properties of a beam, plate, shell or 3D solid in terms of its microstructural details.&lt;ref name="liuyu2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Liu X., Yu W.|title=A Novel Approach to Analyze Beam-like Composite Structures Using Mechanics of Structure Genome|journal=Advances in Engineering Software|volume=100|pages=238–251|year=2016|doi=10.1016/j.advengsoft.2016.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companion code SwiftComp can be freely executed in the cloud at https://cdmhub.org/resources/scstandard.

=== Generalized Method of Cells (GMC) ===
Explicitly considers fiber and matrix subcells from periodic repeating unit cell. Assumes 1st-order [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement field]] in subcells and imposes traction and [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] continuity. It was developed into the '''High-Fidelity GMC (HFGMC)''', which uses quadratic approximation for the [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement fields]] in the subcells.

=== Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) ===
A further group of periodic homogenization models make use of [[Fast Fourier transform|Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)]], e.g., for solving an equivalent to the [[Lippmann–Schwinger equation]].&lt;ref name="moulinec97"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Moulinec H. |author2=Suquet P. |title=A Numerical Method for Computing the Overall Response of Nonlinear Composites with Complex Microstructure|journal=Comput.

== Volume Elements ==

Ideally, the volume elements used in numerical approaches to continuum micromechanics should be sufficiently big to fully describe the statistics of the phase arrangement of the material considered, i.e., they should be [[Representative elementary volume|Representative Volume Elements (RVEs)]].
In practice, smaller volume elements must typically be used due to limitations in available computational power. Such volume elements are often referred to as Statistical Volume Elements (SVEs). [[Ensemble average|Ensemble averaging]] over a number of SVEs may be used for improving the approximations to the macroscopic responses.&lt;ref name="kanit03"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kanit T. |author2=Forest S. |author3=Galliet I. |author4=Mounoury V. |author5=Jeulin D. |title=Determination of the Size of the Representative Volume Element for Random Composites: Statistical and Numerical Approach|journal=Int.

{{infobox neodymium}}
'''Neodymium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Nd''' and [[atomic number]] 60. It is a soft silvery metal that [[tarnish]]es in air. Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]]. It is present in significant quantities in the ore minerals [[monazite]] and [[bastnäsite]]. Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other [[lanthanide]]s, and it is usually refined for general use. Although neodymium is classed as a [[rare-earth element|rare earth]], it is a fairly common element, no rarer than [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], or [[copper]], and is widely distributed in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Abundances of the elements (data page)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the world's commercial neodymium is [[mining|mined]] in China.

Neodymium [[Chemical compound|compounds]] were first commercially used as glass dyes in 1927, and they remain a popular additive in glasses. The color of neodymium compounds—due to the Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion—is often a reddish-purple but it changes with the type of lighting, due to the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands of neodymium with ambient light enriched with the sharp visible emission bands of mercury, trivalent europium or terbium. Some neodymium-doped glasses are also used in [[laser]]s that emit [[infrared]] with [[wavelength]]s between 1047 and 1062 [[nanometer]]s. These have been used in extremely-high-power applications, such as experiments in [[inertial confinement fusion]].

Neodymium is also used with various other [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]] crystals, such as [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] in the [[Nd:YAG laser]]. This laser usually emits infrared at a [[wavelength]] of about 1064 nanometers. The Nd:YAG laser is one of the most commonly used [[solid-state laser]]s.

Another important use of neodymium is as a component in the alloys used to make high-strength [[neodymium magnet]]s—powerful permanent magnets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2012_08/pr1601.htm Toshiba Develops Dysprosium-free Samarium-Cobalt Magnet to Replace Heat-resistant Neodymium Magnet in Essential Applications]. Toshiba (2012-08-16). Retrieved on 2012-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt; These magnets are widely used in such products as microphones, professional loudspeakers, in-ear headphones, high performance hobby DC electric motors, and computer hard disks, where low magnet mass (or volume) or strong magnetic fields are required. Larger neodymium magnets are used in high-power-versus-weight [[electric motor]]s (for example in [[hybrid cars]]) and generators (for example [[aircraft]] and [[wind turbine]] [[electric generator]]s).&lt;ref name=reu&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE57U02B20090831 As hybrid cars gobble rare metals, shortage looms], Reuters, August 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Neodymium, a [[rare-earth element|rare-earth]] [[metal]], was present in the classical [[mischmetal]] at a concentration of about 18%. Metallic neodymium has a bright, silvery metallic luster, but as one of the more reactive [[lanthanide]] rare-earth [[metal]]s, it quickly [[redox|oxidizes]] in ordinary air. The [[neodymium(III) oxide|oxide]] layer that forms then peels off, exposing the metal to further oxidation. Thus, a [[Centimetre|centimeter]]-sized sample of neodymium completely oxidizes within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elementsales.com/re_exp/index.htm |title = Rare-Earth Metal Long Term Air Exposure Test|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neodymium commonly exists in two [[Allotropy|allotropic]] forms, with a transformation from a double hexagonal to a [[body-centered cubic]] structure taking place at about 863&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| author = C. R. Hammond |title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition=81st | publisher =CRC press| date = 2000| isbn = 0-8493-0481-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Neodymium metal tarnishes slowly in air and it burns readily at about 150&amp;nbsp;°C to form [[neodymium(III) oxide]]:
:4 Nd + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Neodymium is a quite electropositive element, and it reacts slowly with cold water, but quite quickly with hot water to form neodymium(III) hydroxide:
:2 Nd (s) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → 2 Nd(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Neodymium metal reacts vigorously with all the [[halogen]]s:
:2 Nd (s) + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 NdF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [a violet substance]
:2 Nd (s) + 3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 NdCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [a mauve substance]
:2 Nd (s) + 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 NdBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [a violet substance]
:2 Nd (s) + 3 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 NdI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [a green substance]

Neodymium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form solutions that contain the lilac Nd(III) ion. These exist as a [Nd(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/neodymium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Neodymium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 Nd (s) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) → 2 Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 3 SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}} (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of neodymium}}
Naturally occurring neodymium is a mixture of five stable [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;142&lt;/sup&gt;Nd, &lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt;Nd, &lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;Nd, &lt;sup&gt;146&lt;/sup&gt;Nd and &lt;sup&gt;148&lt;/sup&gt;Nd, with &lt;sup&gt;142&lt;/sup&gt;Nd being the most abundant (27.2% of the [[natural abundance]]), and two [[radioisotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Nd and &lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;Nd. In all, 31 radioisotopes of neodymium have been detected {{as of|2010|lc=yes}}, with the most stable radioisotopes being the naturally occurring ones: &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Nd ([[alpha decay]] with a [[half-life]] (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 2.29×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years) and &lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;Nd ([[double beta decay]], ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 7×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; years, approximately). All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than eleven days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are shorter than 70 seconds. Neodymium also has 13 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable one being &lt;sup&gt;139''m''&lt;/sup&gt;Nd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.5 hours), &lt;sup&gt;135''m''&lt;/sup&gt;Nd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.5 minutes) and &lt;sup&gt;133''m''1&lt;/sup&gt;Nd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; ~70 seconds).

The primary [[decay mode]]s before the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;142&lt;/sup&gt;Nd, are [[electron capture]] and [[positron decay]], and the primary mode after is [[beta minus decay]]. The primary [[decay product]]s before &lt;sup&gt;142&lt;/sup&gt;Nd are element Pr ([[praseodymium]]) isotopes and the primary products after are element Pm ([[promethium]]) isotopes.

==History==
[[File:Auer von Welsbach.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Carl Auer von Welsbach]] (1858–1929), the discoverer of neodymium]]
Neodymium was discovered by Baron [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]], an Austrian [[chemist]], in [[Vienna]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=v. Welsbach |first1=Carl Auer |title=Die Zerlegung des Didyms in seine Elemente |journal=Monatshefte für Chemie und verwandte Teile anderer Wissenschaften |volume=6|issue=1 |year=1885|pages=477–491 |issn=0343-7329 |doi=10.1007/BF01554643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Extractive Metallurgy of Rare Earths|last = Krishnamurthy|first = N.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-203-41302-9|location = |pages = 6|last2 = Gupta|first2 = C. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The year of discovery is wrong in this book. Confirmed by a n email from the author--&gt; He separated neodymium, as well as the [[Chemical element|element]] [[praseodymium]], from a material known as [[didymium]] by means of fractional crystallization of the double ammonium nitrate tetrahydrates from [[nitric acid]], while following the separation by [[spectroscopic]] analysis; however, it was not isolated in relatively pure form until 1925. The name neodymium is derived from the Greek words ''neos'' (νέος), new, and ''didymos'' (διδύμος), twin.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC| pages= 268–270|title = Nature's building blocks: an A–Z guide to the elements| author =John Emsley| publisher= Oxford University Press| date = 2003| isbn = 0-19-850340-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks1932"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary Elvira|title=The discovery of the elements.

Double nitrate crystallization was the means of commercial neodymium purification until the 1950s. Lindsay Chemical Division was the first to commercialize large-scale ion-exchange purification of neodymium. Starting in the 1950s, high purity (above 99%) neodymium was primarily obtained through an [[ion exchange]] process from [[monazite]], a mineral rich in rare-earth elements. The metal itself is obtained through [[electrolysis]] of its [[halide]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]. Currently, most neodymium is extracted from bastnäsite, (Ce,La,Nd,Pr)CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F, and purified by solvent extraction. Ion-exchange purification is reserved for preparing the highest purities (typically &gt;99.99%). The evolving technology, and improved purity of commercially available neodymium oxide, was reflected in the appearance of neodymium glass that resides in collections today. Early neodymium glasses made in the 1930s have a more reddish or orange tinge than modern versions which are more cleanly purple, due to the difficulties in removing the last traces of praseodymium in the era when manufacturing relied upon fractional crystallization technology.

==Occurrence and production==
[[File:Bastnaesite - Kischtimsk, Ural.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bastnäsite]]]]
Neodymium is rarely found in nature as a free element, but rather it occurs in ores such as [[monazite]] and [[bastnäsite]] (these are mineral group names rather than single mineral names) that contain small amounts of all rare-earth metals. In these minerals neodymium is rarely dominant (as in the case of lanthanum), with cerium being the most abundant lanthanide; some exceptions include monazite-(Nd) and kozoite-(Nd).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/ |title=Mindat.org |author=Hudson Institute of Mineralogy |date=1993–2018 |website=www.mindat.org |access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main mining areas are in China, the United States, [[Brazil]], India, [[Sri Lanka]], and Australia. The reserves of neodymium are estimated at about eight million tonnes. Although it belongs to the [[Rare-earth element|rare-earth metals]], neodymium is not rare at all. Its abundance in the [[Earth]]'s crust is about 38&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, which is the second highest among rare-earth elements, following [[cerium]]. The world's production of neodymium was about 7,000 tonnes in 2004.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The bulk of current production is from China. {{As of|2010|01}} the Chinese government has imposed strategic material controls on the element, raising some concerns in consuming countries and causing skyrocketing prices of neodymium and other rare-earth metals.&lt;ref&gt;Milmo, Cahal (2010-01-02). [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/concern-as-china-clamps-down-on-rare-earth-exports-1855387.html Concern as China clamps down on rare earth exports], ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2011, 99% pure neodymium was traded in world markets for US$300 to US$350 per kilogram, down from the mid-2011 peak of US$500/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/business/global/prices-of-rare-earth-metals-declining-sharply.html| title=Prices of Rare Earth Metals Declining Sharply| newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price of neodymium oxide fell from $200/kg in 2011 to $40 in 2015, largely due to illegal production in China which circumvented government restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/mcs-2016-raree.pdf Rare Earths].

Neodymium is typically 10–18% of the rare-earth content of commercial deposits of the light rare-earth-element minerals bastnäsite and monazite.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} With neodymium compounds being the most strongly colored for the trivalent lanthanides, it can occasionally dominate the coloration of rare-earth minerals when competing chromophores are absent. It usually gives a pink coloration. Outstanding examples of this include monazite crystals from the [[tin]] deposits in [[Llallagua]], [[Bolivia]]; [[ancylite]] from [[Mont Saint-Hilaire]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]; or [[lanthanite]] from the [[Lower Saucon Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Saucon Valley]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. As with neodymium glasses, such minerals change their colors under the differing lighting conditions. The absorption bands of neodymium interact with the visible [[emission spectrum]] of [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury vapor]], with the unfiltered shortwave UV light causing neodymium-containing minerals to reflect a distinctive green color. This can be observed with monazite-containing sands or bastnäsite-containing ore.

==Applications==
* Neodymium has an unusually large specific [[heat capacity]] at liquid-helium temperatures, so is useful in [[cryocoolers]].
* Probably because of similarities to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; has been reported&lt;ref&gt;Y. Wei ''et al.''

Rare-earth-element compounds are frequently used in China as [[fertilizer]].
* [[Samarium–neodymium dating]] is useful for determining the age relationships of rocks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7639024.stm|title =Team finds Earth's 'oldest rocks'|publisher =BBC news|accessdate = 2009-06-06|date=2008-09-26|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meteorites.

===Magnets===
[[File:Neodymag.jpg|thumb|Neodymium magnet on a [[mu-metal]] bracket from a [[hard drive]]]]
[[Neodymium magnet]]s (actually an alloy, Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B) are the strongest [[permanent magnet]]s known. A neodymium magnet of a few grams can lift a thousand times its own weight. These magnets are cheaper, lighter, and stronger than [[samarium–cobalt magnet]]s. However, they are not superior in every aspect, as neodymium-based magnets lose their magnetism at lower temperatures and tend to rust, while samarium–cobalt magnets do not.

Neodymium magnets appear in products such as [[microphone]]s, professional [[loudspeaker]]s, in-ear [[headphones]], [[guitar]] and [[bass guitar]] [[Pickup (music technology)|pick-ups]], and computer [[hard disk]]s where low mass, small volume, or strong magnetic fields are required. Neodymium magnet electric motors have also been responsible for the development of purely electrical model aircraft within the first decade of the 21st century, to the point that these are displacing internal combustion–powered models internationally.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Likewise, due to this high magnetic capacity per weight, neodymium is used in the electric motors of hybrid and electric automobiles, and in the electricity generators of some designs of commercial wind turbines (only wind turbines with "permanent magnet" generators use neodymium). For example, drive electric motors of each [[Toyota Prius]] require one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of neodymium per vehicle.&lt;ref name=reu/&gt;

===Neodymium doped lasers===
[[File:YAG2.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Neodymium ions in various types of ionic crystals, and also in glasses, act as a laser gain medium, typically emitting 1064 nm light from a particular atomic transition in the neodymium ion, after being "pumped" into excitation from an external source]]
[[File:Laser glass slabs.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Neodymium doped glass slabs used in extremely powerful lasers for [[inertial confinement fusion]].]]
[[File:Yag-rod.jpg|thumb|left|Nd:YAG laser rod]]
Certain transparent materials with a small concentration of neodymium [[ion]]s can be used in [[laser]]s as [[gain medium|gain media]] for infrared wavelengths (1054–1064&amp;nbsp;nm), e.g. [[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]] (yttrium aluminium garnet), [[Neodymium-doped yttrium lithium fluoride|Nd:YLF]] (yttrium lithium fluoride), [[Neodymium-doped yttrium orthovanadate|Nd:YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] (yttrium orthovanadate), and Nd:glass. Neodymium-doped crystals (typically Nd:YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) generate high-powered infrared laser beams which are converted to green laser light in commercial [[DPSS]] hand-held lasers and [[laser pointer]]s.

The current laser at the UK [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (AWE), the HELEN (High Energy Laser Embodying Neodymium) 1-[[terawatt]] neodymium-glass laser, can access the midpoints of pressure and temperature regions and is used to acquire data for modeling on how density, temperature, and pressure interact inside warheads. HELEN can create plasmas of around 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|K]], from which opacity and transmission of radiation are measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.41.003497|title=Multipass Reconfiguration of the HELEN Nd:Glass Laser at the Atomic Weapons Establishment|date=2002|journal=Applied Optics|volume=41|pages=3497–505|pmid=12078672|issue=18|bibcode = 2002ApOpt..41.3497N |display-authors=4 |last2=Andrew|first2=J.

J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neodymium glass [[solid-state laser]]s are used in extremely high power ([[1 E11 W#1 terawatt|terawatt]] scale), high energy ([[megajoule]]s) multiple beam systems for [[inertial confinement fusion]]. Nd:glass lasers are usually [[nonlinear optics|frequency tripled]] to the [[optical frequency multiplier|third harmonic]] at 351&amp;nbsp;nm in laser fusion devices.

===Neodymium glass for other applications===
[[File:Neodymium glass light bulb under fluorescent and incandescent light.jpg|thumb|A neodymium glass [[light bulb]], with the base and inner coating removed, under two different types of light: [[fluorescent]] on the left, and [[incandescent]] on the right.]]
[[File:Neodymium-glass.jpg|thumb|Neodymium-colored glass]]
Neodymium [[glass]] (Nd:glass) is produced by the inclusion of [[neodymium(III) oxide|neodymium oxide]] (Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the glass melt. Usually in daylight or [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent]] light neodymium glass appears lavender, but it appears pale blue under [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] lighting. Neodymium may be used to color [[glass]] in delicate shades ranging from pure violet through wine-red and warm gray.

The first commercial use of purified neodymium was in glass coloration, starting with experiments by Leo Moser in November 1927. The resulting "Alexandrite" glass remains a signature color of the Moser glassworks to this day. Neodymium glass was widely emulated in the early 1930s by American glasshouses, most notably Heisey, Fostoria ("wisteria"), Cambridge ("heatherbloom"), and Steuben ("wisteria"), and elsewhere (e.g. Lalique, in France, or Murano). Tiffin's "twilight" remained in production from about 1950 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloradosprings.yourhub.com/CrippleCreekTellerCounty/Stories/Arts/Story~443258.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403165916/http://coloradosprings.yourhub.com/CrippleCreekTellerCounty/Stories/Arts/Story~443258.aspx |archivedate=2008-04-03|title =Chameleon Glass Changes Color|accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current sources include glassmakers in the Czech Republic, the United States, and China.

The sharp absorption bands of neodymium cause the glass color to change under different lighting conditions, being reddish-purple under [[daylight]] or yellow [[incandescent light]], but blue under white [[fluorescent light]]ing, or greenish under [[Trichromacy|trichromatic]] lighting. This color-change phenomenon is highly prized by collectors. In combination with [[gold]] or [[selenium]], beautiful red colors result. Since neodymium coloration depends upon "[[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden]]" f-f transitions deep within the atom, there is relatively little influence on the color from the chemical environment, so the color is impervious to the thermal history of the glass. However, for the best color, [[iron]]-containing impurities need to be minimized in the [[silica]] used to make the glass. The same forbidden nature of the f-f transitions makes [[Rare-earth element|rare-earth]] colorants less intense than those provided by most d-transition elements, so more has to be used in a glass to achieve the desired color intensity. The original Moser recipe used about 5% of neodymium oxide in the glass melt, a sufficient quantity such that Moser referred to these as being "rare-earth doped" glasses. Being a strong base, that level of neodymium would have affected the melting properties of the glass, and the [[Calcium oxide|lime]] content of the glass might have had to be adjusted accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbZkxDyeG18C&amp;pg=PA102| title=Dictionary of glass: materials and techniques| author=Charles Bray| publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press| date = 2001| isbn=0-8122-3619-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light transmitted through neodymium glasses shows unusually sharp [[absorption band]]s; the glass is used in [[astronomy|astronomical work]] to produce sharp bands by which [[spectral line]]s may be calibrated. Another application is the creation of selective astronomical filters to reduce the effect of light pollution from sodium and fluorescent lighting while passing other colours, especially dark red hydrogen-alpha emission from nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.firstlightoptics.com/light-pollution-reduction/baader-neodymium-filter.html Baader Neodymium Filter], First Light Optics.&lt;/ref&gt; Neodymium is also used to remove the green color caused by [[iron]] contaminants from glass.

Neodymium is a component of "[[didymium]]" (referring to mixture of salts of neodymium and [[praseodymium]]) used for coloring glass to make [[welding|welder]]'s and glass-blower's goggles; the sharp absorption bands obliterate the strong sodium emission at 589&amp;nbsp;nm.  The similar absorption of the yellow mercury emission line at 578&amp;nbsp;nm is the principal cause of the blue color observed for neodymium glass under traditional white-fluorescent lighting.

Neodymium and didymium glass are used in color-enhancing filters in indoor photography, particularly in filtering out the yellow hues from incandescent lighting.

Similarly, neodymium glass is becoming widely used more directly in [[incandescent light bulb]]s. These lamps contain neodymium in the glass to filter out yellow light, resulting in a whiter light which is more like sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gelighting.com/apo/resources/learn_about_light/history_of_light.htm|title=History of Light, subheading "Timeline", 2001|accessdate=2010-08-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213081554/http://www.gelighting.com/apo/resources/learn_about_light/history_of_light.htm|archivedate=2010-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of neodymium in automobile rear-view mirrors, to reduce the glare at night, has been patented.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Similar to its use in glasses, neodymium salts are used as a colorant for [[vitreous enamel|enamels]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Neodymium metal dust is combustible and therefore an explosion hazard. Neodymium compounds, as with all rare-earth metals, are of low to moderate toxicity; however, its toxicity has not been thoroughly investigated. Neodymium dust and salts are very irritating to the eyes and [[mucous membrane]]s, and moderately irritating to skin. Breathing the dust can cause lung [[embolism]]s, and accumulated exposure damages the liver. Neodymium also acts as an [[anticoagulant]], especially when given intravenously.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Neodymium magnets have been tested for medical uses such as magnetic braces and bone repair, but [[biocompatibility]] issues have prevented widespread application. Commercially available magnets made from neodymium are exceptionally strong, and can attract each other from large distances. If not handled carefully, they come together very quickly and forcefully, causing injuries. For example, there is at least one documented case of a person losing a fingertip when two magnets he was using snapped together from 50&amp;nbsp;cm away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Swain|first = Frank|title = How to remove a finger with two super magnets| publisher = Seed Media Group LLC|date = March 6, 2009|url = http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/03/06/how-to-remove-a-finger-with-tw/| accessdate = 2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another risk of these powerful magnets is that if more than one magnet is ingested, they can pinch soft tissues in the gastrointestinal tract. This has led to at least 1,700 emergency room visits and necessitated the recall of the [[Buckyball (toy)|Buckyballs line of toys]], which were construction sets of small neodymium magnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Abrams|first = Rachel|title = After Two-Year Fight, Consumer Agency Orders Recall of Buckyballs| publisher = New York Times|date = July 17, 2014|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/business/after-two-year-fight-consumer-agency-orders-recall-of-buckyballs.html?_r=0| accessdate = 2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neodymium Magnets:Too Attractive?|date=2014|journal=Medscape Gastroenterology|authors=William F.

'''''Odyssey''''', which previously went by the name ''Oriental Phoenix'', was an oil tanker in operation from 1971 to November 10, 1988, when an explosion caused it to sink in the [[North Atlantic]] off the coast of [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; The resulting spill remains one of the largest [[List of oil spills|oil spills]] in world history. The tanker was {{convert|700|nmi}} off the coast of the Canadian province of [[Nova Scotia]] when it sank and released 132,157 tons (43 million gallons) of oil into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Infoplease | title=Oil Spills and Disasters |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001451.html | publisher=Pearson Education | date=2009 | accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itopf"&gt;{{cite web | author=Information Services | title=Data &amp; Statistics: Accidental Marine oil Spillages Since 1970| url=http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/statistics/index.html | publisher=International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) | date=7 May 2010 | accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of comparison, 4.3 times as much oil was spilled by the ''Odyssey'' as from the much more famous ''[[Exxon Valdez]]''.

==Sinking==
Odyssey, built in 1971, was a 65,000-ton tanker operated by [[Polembros Shipping Ltd.]] of [[London]], [[England]], and registered in [[Liberia]]. On November 5, 1988, the tanker departed [[Sullom Voe Terminal]] in the [[Shetland Islands]] off [[Scotland]], fully loaded with [[North Sea]] [[Brent Crude|Brent Crude oil]] which was being transported to the [[Come By Chance Refinery]] at [[Come By Chance, Newfoundland and Labrador|Come-by-Chance]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

When the ship was about 1000 [[nautical miles]] off the coast of Newfoundland, a major [[North Atlantic]] storm arose, buffetting the ship with {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} waves and 44-mile-per-hour winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Edith M. Lederer | title=27 Missing Off Foundering Oil Tanker |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YOoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lc4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=odyssey%20oil%20spill&amp;pg=5066%2C2728248 | publisher=Associated Press | date=11 November 1988 | accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the ship sent out a distress signal and kept heading for shore. The distress call was received by [[Radio Valentia]] in Ireland and transferred to the [[Canadian Rescue Coordination Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Odyssey - Cedre|url = http://wwz.cedre.fr/en/Our-resources/Spills/Spills/Odyssey|website = wwz.cedre.fr|accessdate = 2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre alerted the vessels in the area. 

However, when the ship was {{convert|700|nmi|km}} off the coast of Nova Scotia, an explosion occurred on board, causing the ship to break into two and begin sinking. As the ship sank, a fire broke out on its stern section, causing the oil on board to catch fire.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, N. (1997) Maritime casualties, 1963-1996.  2nd edition, LLP Limited, London&lt;/ref&gt; A Russian weather ship, [[List of active Russian Navy ships|Passat]], responded to the Odyssey's distress call and was on site in less than an hour. Once on site however, it was unable to approach the vessel as it was surrounded by ignited oil slicks. 

All 27 crew members, 15 Greeks and 12 Hondurans, are presumed to have died during the incident.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | author=Larry West | title=The 10 Worst Oil Spills in History |url=http://environment.about.com/od/environmentalevents/tp/worst-oil-spills.htm | publisher=About.com | date=2010| accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of hazardous weather conditions, the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] could not immediately reach the spill and much of the oil burned up before the coast guard reached the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Remy Melina | title=The 10 Worst Oil Spills in History |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36852827/ns/us_news-environment/ | publisher=MSNBC | date=29 April 2010 | accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
In the immediate aftermath of the ship's sinking, the oil spill covered an area of {{convert|3|mi|km}} x {{convert|10|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web | author=Reuters | title=Tanker Splits in 2 in Atlantic Storm |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/11/world/tanker-splits-in-2-in-atlantic-storm.html | publisher=New York Times | date=11 November 1988 | accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A much reduced amount of oil reached shore - in part because of the oil's rapid combustion from the initial explosion and in part because currents carried the spill across the Atlantic, in the direction of England, giving the oil a significant amount of time to dissipate in the rough seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author="Steve" | title=Sick Slicks: Counting Down The 13 Worst Oil Spills |url=http://webecoist.com/2010/05/04/sick-slicks-counting-down-the-13-worst-oil-spills/ | publisher=Webecoist | date=2010 | accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, no clean-up operation was mounted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Anne Casselman | title=10 Biggest Oil Spills in History |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/coal-oil-gas/biggest-oil-spills-in-history | magazine=Popular Mechanics | date=2010 | accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Advisory Committee on Marine Pollution of the Sea of the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] published an analysis of the spill in their ''1990 Marine Pollution Yearbook'' which noted that the spill likely had a significant effect on [[krill]] in the area, and through them, may have affected animals further up the [[food chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=International Council for the Exploration of the Sea | title=Marine Pollution: Yearbook 1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXAQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=ODYSSEY+spill+canada+oil&amp;dq=ODYSSEY+spill+canada+oil&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vg0XTLOtLoK2Nq78sccL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ | publisher=Pergamon | date=1990 | accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*GOR - Gas to oil ratio describing how many [[standard cubic feet]] of gas can be obtained for every [[Barrel (unit)| stock tank barrel]] of oil.
*[[Hydrogen sulfide| H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] - the concentration of this gas.  Fluids with a high concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S are described as "sour".

The '''Rimini Protocol''' (also called ''Uppsala Protocol'') is a proposal made by the [[geologist]] [[Colin Campbell (geologist)|Colin Campbell]] in 2003. It is intended to stabilise [[Petroleum|oil]] prices and minimize the effects of [[Hubbert peak theory|peak oil]].

To achieve this, producing countries would not produce oil in excess of their present national depletion rate: i.e., roughly speaking, the oil burnt, expended or exported must equal the oil produced or imported. Furthermore, it would be required that importing nations stabilize their imports at existing levels. This would have the effect of keeping world prices in reasonable relationship to actual production costs and let [[Third World]] countries afford their oil imports.

Campbell also stresses the need for outdated principles of economic growth to be surpassed. He states (May 2004): "the economic fundamentalists ... have these really outdated economic principles inherited from the Industrial Revolution, when the world was indeed large and the scope for Man’s activities were at that time more or less infinite. ... these economic principles ... are very short term in their nature ... these people who say that there can be no shortage in an open market and their battle cry is liberalize markets - these people have become really the enemy ..." [http://energybulletin.dev.postcarbon.org/node/599]. As such, Campbell strongly criticises those who accelerate the "peak oil" crisis, rather than taking action to curtail it as he recommends.

Campbell substantiates the prediction of the urgent forthcoming "peak oil" crisis by making reference to [[Saudi Arabia]], a nation covering a geographic region wherein there is a huge concentration of oil. Campbell hypothesises: "I think even the Sauds would always develop the larger ones first. So the biggest field in the world is [[Ghawar]], with 80 billion in it perhaps, you step outside from this trend to [[Safaniya]] with 35 perhaps, [[Hənifə|Hanifah]] about 12 and [[Shaybah]] 15, and you come on down. If they develop the big ones first, which one must assume they did, you are down to well, still nice oilfields but of a modest scale, and so I suppose the other discoveries they made have made are smaller by orders of magnitude ... it’s quite evident that this doesn’t come close to the past."

Support for the Rimini Protocol has even been found in retired politicians.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  In regard thereto, Campbell proclaims: "And then ... you have the people I call the Renegades. These are senior politicians who are now out of office and being freed from the system, are able to tell the truth. And some of them do."

The '''rosy tetra''' (''Hyphessobrycon rosaceus'') is a small species of [[Characin]] from the South American countries of [[Guyana]] and [[Brazil]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}It is popular in the [[aquarium]] trade.

==Description==
The rosy tetra has a light pink-white body with red fins, except the dorsal fin which can be black or white, and the caudal fin which is pink-white with two elliptical red spots on it. It has a faint black line from the top of its eyeball through the pupil, to the bottom of the eyeball. Like many other [[tetra]]s, the males have longer dorsal fins than the females.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==In the aquarium==
A group of 6 Rosy tetras would feel best in an aquarium with volume of 20 US gallons (76 L).

==Distribution==
In the wild, the rosy tetra lives in the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]], [[Courantyne River|Corantijn]] and [[Suriname River]] basins in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyphessobrycon rosaceus|url=http://www.fishbase.se/summary/12383|publisher=FishBase|accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
The rosy tetra is an egg scattering school [[spawning]] fish in the wild. 100 eggs can be laid by one female, usually in the early morning, and over fine leaved plants.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A '''sawmill''' or '''lumber mill''' is a facility where [[logging|logs]] are cut into [[lumber]]. Modern saw mills use a motorized saw to cut logs lengthwise to make long pieces, and crosswise to length depending on standard or custom sizes ([[dimensional lumber]]). The "portable" saw mill is iconic and of simple operation—the logs lay flat on a steel bed and the motorized saw cuts the log horizontally along the length of the bed, by the operator manually pushing the saw. The most basic kind of saw mill consists of a [[chainsaw]] and a customized jig ("Alaskan saw mill"), with similar horizontal operation.

Before the invention of the sawmill, boards were made in various [[manual labour|manual]] ways, either [[wood splitting|rived (split)]] and [[plane (tool)|planed]], [[hewing|hewn]], or more often [[hand saw]]n by two men with a [[whipsaw]], one above and another in a [[saw pit]] below. The earliest known mechanical mill is the [[Hierapolis sawmill]], a Roman water-powered stone mill at [[Hierapolis]], [[Asia Minor]] dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.

By the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 18th century, the circular saw blade had been invented, and with the development of steam power in the 19th century, a much greater degree of mechanisation was possible. Scrap lumber from the mill provided a source of fuel for firing the boiler. The arrival of railroads meant that logs could be transported to mills rather than mills being built besides navigable waterways. By 1900, the largest sawmill in the world was operated by the Atlantic Lumber Company in Georgetown, South Carolina, using logs floated down the [[Pee Dee River]] from the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. In the 20th century the introduction of electricity and high technology furthered this process, and now most sawmills are massive and [[capital intensity|expensive]] facilities in which most aspects of the work is computerized. Besides the sawn timber, use is made of all the by-products including [[sawdust]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[woodchips]], and [[wood pellets]], creating a diverse offering of [[forest product]]s.

==Sawmill process==&lt;!-- [[Cant]] links to this section --&gt;
A sawmill's basic operation is much like those of hundreds of years ago; a log enters on one end and [[Lumber#Dimensional lumber|dimensional lumber]] exits on the other end.
* After trees are selected for harvest, the next step in [[logging]] is [[felling]] the trees, and [[log bucking|bucking]] them to length.
* Branches are cut off the trunk. This is known as ''limbing''.
* Logs are taken by [[logging truck]], rail or a [[log driving|log drive]] to the sawmill.
* Logs are [[Log scaler|scaled]] either on the way to the mill or upon arrival at the mill.
* Debarking removes bark from the logs.
* ''Decking'' is the process for sorting the logs by species, size and end use (lumber, [[plywood]], chips).
* A [[Sawyer (occupation)|sawyer]] uses a [[head saw]] (also called head rig or primary saw) to break the log into cants (unfinished logs to be further processed) and flitches (unfinished planks).
* Depending upon the species and quality of the log, the cants will either be further broken down by a [[resaw]] or a [[gang edger]] into multiple flitches and/or boards.
* [[Lumber edger|''Edging'']] will take the flitch and trim off all irregular edges leaving four-sided [[lumber]].
* ''Trimming'' squares the ends at typical lumber lengths.
* [[Wood drying|''Drying'']] removes naturally occurring moisture from the lumber. This can be done with [[Kiln#Wood-drying kiln|kilns]] or air-dried.
* ''Planing'' smooths the surface of the lumber leaving a uniform width and thickness.
* ''Shipping'' transports the finished lumber to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Hierapolis sawmill]], a [[List of Roman watermills|water-powered stone saw mill]] at [[Hierapolis]], [[Asia Minor]] (modern-day [[Turkey]], then part of the [[Roman Empire]]), dating to the second half of the 3rd century, is the earliest known sawmill. It also incorporates a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[connecting rod]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2000, 161"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water-powered stone sawmills working with cranks and connecting rods, but without [[gear train]], are archaeologically attested for the 6th century at the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] cities [[Gerasa]] (in Asia Minor) and [[Ephesus]] (in [[Syria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|pp=149–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest literary reference to a working sawmill comes from a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] poet, [[Ausonius]], who wrote a [[Topographical poetry|topographical poem]] about the river [[Moselle]] in [[Germany]] in the late 4th century AD. At one point in the poem he describes the shrieking sound of a watermill cutting [[marble]].&lt;ref name="Wilson 2002, 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marble sawmills also seem to be indicated by the [[Christian saint]] [[Gregory of Nyssa]] from [[Anatolia]] around 370/390 AD, demonstrating a diversified use of water-power in many parts of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Wilson 2002, 16"/&gt;

By the 11th century, [[hydropower]]ed sawmills were in widespread use in the medieval [[Islamic world]], from [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and [[North Africa]] in the west to [[Central Asia]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Robert Lucas (2005), "Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe", ''Technology and Culture'' '''46''' (1): 1-30 [o10-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sawmills later became widespread in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], as one was sketched by [[Villard de Honnecourt]] in c. 1250.&lt;ref&gt;C. Singer ''et at.'', ''History of Technology'' II (Oxford 1956), 643-4.&lt;/ref&gt; They are claimed to have been introduced to [[Madeira]] following its discovery in c. 1420 and spread widely in Europe in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Charles E. |authorlink=Charles E. Peterson |title=Sawdust Trail: Annals of Sawmilling and the Lumber Trade from Virginia to Hawaii via Maine, Barbados, Sault Ste. Marie, Manchac and Seattle to the Year 1860 |journal=[[Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=1973 |pages=84-153 |doi=10.2307/1493399 |jstor=1493399}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84-85}}

Prior to the invention of the sawmill, boards were [[Wood splitting|rived (split)]] and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a [[whipsaw]], using saddleblocks to hold the log, and a [[saw pit]] for the pitman who worked below. Sawing was slow, and required strong and hearty men. The topsawer had to be the stronger of the two because the saw was pulled in turn by each man, and the lower had the advantage of gravity. The topsawyer also had to guide the saw so that the board was of even thickness. This was often done by following a chalkline.

Early sawmills simply adapted the [[whipsaw]] to mechanical power, generally driven by a [[water wheel]] to speed up the process. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by a [[connecting rod]] known as a ''[[pitman arm]]'' (thus introducing a term used in many mechanical applications).

Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.

A type of sawmill without a crank is known from Germany called "knock and drop" or simply "drop" -mills. In these drop sawmills, the frame carrying the saw blade is knocked upwards by cams as the shaft turns. These cams are let into the shaft on which the waterwheel sits. When the frame carrying the saw blade is in the topmost position it drops by its own weight, making a loud knocking noise, and in so doing it cuts the trunk.&lt;ref name="Die Sägemühle"&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Sägemühle|url=http://www.familienverband-tritschler.de/index.php?id=81&amp;L=1|website=www.familienverband-tritschler.de|accessdate=May 8, 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small mill such as this would be the center of many rural communities in wood-exporting regions such as the [[Baltic countries]] and [[Canada]]. The output of such mills would be quite low, perhaps only 500 boards per day. They would also generally only operate during the winter, the peak logging season.

In the [[United States]], the sawmill was introduced soon after the colonisation of [[Virginia]] by recruiting skilled men from [[Hamburg]].
Later the metal parts were obtained from the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94-95}} where the technology was far ahead of that in [[England]], where the sawmill remained largely unknown until the late 18th century. The arrival of a sawmill was a large and stimulative step in the growth of a frontier community.

==Industrial Revolution==
Early mills had been taken to the forest, where a temporary shelter was built, and the logs were skidded to the nearby mill by horse or ox teams, often when there was some snow to provide lubrication. As mills grew larger, they were usually established in more permanent facilities on a river, and the logs were floated down to them by [[log driver]]s. Sawmills built on navigable rivers, lakes, or estuaries were called cargo mills because of the availability of ships transporting cargoes of logs to the sawmill and cargoes of lumber from the sawmill.&lt;ref name="oak"&gt;Oakleaf p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The next improvement was the use of circular saw blades, perhaps invented in England in the late 18th century, but perhaps in 17th-century [[Holland]], the [[Netherlands]]. Soon thereafter, millers used gangsaws, which added additional blades so that a log would be reduced to boards in one quick step. Circular saw blades were extremely expensive and highly subject to damage by overheating or dirty logs. A new kind of technician arose, the [[sawfiler]]. Sawfilers were highly skilled in metalworking. Their main job was to ''set'' and sharpen teeth. The craft also involved learning how to ''hammer'' a saw, whereby a saw is deformed with a hammer and anvil to counteract the forces of heat and cutting. Modern [[circular saw]] blades have replaceable teeth, but still need to be hammered.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Ball, 'Circular Saws and the History of Technology' ''Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology'' 7(3) (1975), pp. 79-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[steam power]] in the 19th century created many new possibilities for mills. Availability of railroad transportation for logs and lumber encouraged building of rail mills away from navigable water. Steam powered sawmills could be far more mechanized. Scrap lumber from the mill provided a ready fuel source for firing the boiler. Efficiency was increased, but the capital cost of a new mill increased dramatically as well.&lt;ref name="oak"/&gt;

In addition, the use of steam or gasoline-powered [[traction engine]]s also allowed the entire sawmill to be mobile.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardian Farm: Roy Hebdige's mobile sawmill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritchiewiki.com/wiki/index.php/Steam_Traction_Engine Steam traction engines]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the largest sawmill in the world was operated by the Atlantic Lumber Company in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]], using logs floated down the [[Pee Dee River]] from as far as the edge of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in [[North Carolina]].

A restoration project for [http://www.sturgeonsmill.com Sturgeon's Mill] in Northern California is underway, restoring one of the last steam-powered lumber mills still using its original equipment.

==Current trends==
[[File:Sawmill1.jpg|thumb|Oregon Mill using energy efficient ponding to move logs]]
In the twentieth century the introduction of electricity and high technology furthered this process, and now most sawmills are massive and expensive facilities in which most aspects of the work is [[computer]]ized. The cost of a new facility with 2 [[Mmfbm]]/day capacity is up to [[Canadian dollar|CAN$]]120,000,000. A modern operation will produce between 100 Mmfbm and 700 Mmfbm annually.

Small gasoline-powered sawmills run by local entrepreneurs served many communities in the early twentieth century, and specialty markets still today.

A trend is the small [[portable sawmill]] for personal or even professional use. Many different models have emerged with different designs and functions. They are especially suitable for producing limited volumes of boards, or specialty milling such as oversized timber. Portable sawmills have gained popularity for the convenience of bringing the sawmill to the logs and milling lumber in remote locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trees2money.com/mobile-milling/|title=Reap the Profits of Mobile Milling|website=Trees 2 Money|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some remote communities that have experienced natural disasters have used portable sawmills to rebuild their communities out of the fallen trees.

Technology has changed sawmill operations significantly in recent years, emphasizing increasing profits through waste minimization and increased energy efficiency as well as improving operator safety. The once-ubiquitous rusty, steel [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] [[sawdust burner]]s have for the most part vanished, as the sawdust and other mill waste is now processed into [[particleboard]] and related products, or used to heat [[Kiln#Wood-drying kiln|wood-drying kilns]]. Co-generation facilities will produce power for the operation and may also feed superfluous energy onto the grid. While the bark may be ground for landscaping [[barkdust]], it may also be burned for heat. Sawdust may make particle board or be pressed into [[wood pellet]]s for pellet stoves. The larger pieces of wood that won't make lumber are chipped into wood chips and provide a source of supply for paper mills. Wood by-products of the mills will also make [[oriented strand board]] (OSB) paneling for building construction, a cheaper alternative to plywood for paneling. Some automatic mills can process 800 small logs into bark chips, wood chips, sawdust and sorted, stacked, and bound planks, in an hour.

Cartoonstock.com cartoonist Graham Chaffer used the term "Snowageddon" (with spelling variation) in a cartoon uploaded to the site in March 2007. A satirical take on the hyperbole used by TV weather reporters. Its caption reads: "And it continues to fall! This is the big chill! The wintery whiteout! The new Ice Age! Snowageddon!"

The '''Spanish Bank of Algae''' (BEA-Banco Español de Algas) is a national R&amp;D service attached to the Marine Biotechnology Center (CBM-Centro de Biotecnología Marina) of the [[University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] (ULPGC), which objectives are the isolation, identification, characterization, conservation and provisioning of [[microalgae]] and [[cyanobacteria]]. It was previously known as the National Bank of Algae (BNA).

==Introduction==
In addition to the functions of isolation, identification, characterization, conservation and provisioning, standard in any collection of [[microorganisms]], the CBM-BEA/[[ULPGC]] aims to function as a service facilitating the development of a new bioindustrial sector based on the cultivation and application of [[microalgae]].

BEA has been member of the European Culture Collection Organization (ECCO) since 2001 and of the [[World Federation for Culture Collections]] (WFCC) since 2003. BEA is listed in the [[World Data Centre for Microorganisms]] (WFCC-[[MIRCEN]]) under registration number 837.

BEA is Accredited as an International Authority for the Deposit of Micro-organisms in accordance with the Treaty of Budapest by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), resolution No. 239 of 28.10.2005 before the Government of Spain.&lt;ref name=registration&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/notdocs/en/budapest/treaty_budapest_239.html|title=Accreditation as an International Authority for Deposit (WIPO) |accessdate=26 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This accreditation confers on  BEA the deposit of algae for the purposes of recognition of [[industrial property]] before the [[World Intellectual Property Office]] and the [[Spanish Patent and Trademark Office]].

BEA holds [[strain (biology)|strain]]s from [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[Subtropics|subtropical areas]], in particular of the [[Macaronesia|Macaronesian Region]]. These cultures have strain numbers preceded by BEA. Non-axenic cultures are marked with "B" at the end of the strain number.

==History==

1985.- The embryo of the Group of Applied Algology, from the former Polytechnic University of the Canaries, started up with the motto "sun and seawater can grow more than tourists."
1995.- The Center of Applied Algology -[[ULPGC]] (now the CBM-[[ULPGC]]) created a collection of [[microalgae]] in 1995 thanks to a generous donation from Dr. Ziiadine Ramazanov (scientist in the former [[USSR]] at the Soviet Academy of Science’s Institute of Plant Physiology and Astrobiology, who worked in the IAA in 1995-96), who gave his personal collection of [[microalgae]] to the IAA, thus helping to introduce the group to the field of [[biotechnology]] of [[microalgae]]. Before that date, the applied phycology group had only worked with [[macroalgae]] in the fields of [[in vitro]] cultures, population genetics and intensive cultures.
1996.- The CBM-BNA lost most of its [[microalga]] collection due to a 5-month electrical outage. Dr. Ramazanov emigrated to the United States, published several books and created a plant biotechnology company.
1998.- The paperwork was started to obtain [[WIPO]] accreditation for the BEA as an International Depositary Authority pursuant to the Budapest Treaty. The [[OEPM]] ([[Spanish Patent and Trademark Office]]) and the [[Spanish Type Culture Collection]] (University of Valencia)&lt;ref name=collection&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cect.org/|title=Spanish Type Culture Collection (University of Valencia) |accessdate=26 December 2011 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; cooperated with this institution to achieve international accreditation for the BEA, a process that lasted until 2005.
1999.- Letter of support from the Council for Scientific Research (Dr. Miguel García Guerrero, [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]-[[Ministry of Education, Social Policy and Sport of Spain|MEC]]) to consolidate the BNA (after an inspection visit to the facilities of what was then called the Centro de Algología Aplicada (Applied Phycology Center) – [[ULPGC]]).
Letter of support was sent from the Spanish Phycology Society to consolidate the BNA (after an inspection visit to the facilities of what was then called the Centro de Algología Aplicada (Applied Phycology Center) – [[ULPGC]]).

The Board of the [[ULPGC]] signed an agreement to break up the CBM-BNA. Following arduous litigation, which ended in 2003 with the final ruling from Spain’s Constitutional Court, the CBM-BNA was left intact.

2000.- The BNA was accepted as a member of the ECCO (European Culture Collection Organization).&lt;ref name=ECCO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eccosite.org/|title=European Culture Collection Organization (ECCO) |accessdate=26 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2001.- Spain’s Parliament (Draft Law 161/000706 of 30 April 2001-Series D, No. 170) urged the government to establish the National Bank of Algae at the [[ULPGC|ULPGC’s]] Applied Phycology Center and to accredit it as an International Depositary Authority pursuant to the Budapest Treaty.

2003.- The BNA became a member of the [[World Federation for Culture Collections]] (WFCC) and received registration number 837 in the WFCC-[[MIRCEN]] World Data Center for Microorganisms.&lt;ref name=WFCC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfcc.info/|title=World Data Center for Microorganisms |accessdate=26 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ULPGC]] endorsed CBM’s bylaws, which defined the BNA as one of the two Services (the other being [[Flow Cytometry]]) offered by the Centro de Biotecnología Marina (Marine Biotechnology Center) – [[ULPGC]]. CBM and BEA are finally recognized by the [[ULPGC]].

2004.- Spain’s [[Ministry of Education, Social Policy and Sport of Spain|Ministry of Education and Science]] (MEC) awards the first and only financial grant conceded to the BEA prior to 2010 (every other local, regional and national grant request was rejected) through its 2003-2006 Complementary Actions aid program.

The BNA collaborates in the first study of oceanic toxic algal blooms in the [[Canary Islands]] (summer 2004), commissioned by the Government of the Canaries Council on Agriculture, Fishing and Food. Resulting from this effort was the paper "Novel Bloom of Trichodesmium erythraeum in the NW African Upwelling".&lt;ref&gt;Ramos et al. 2005, p.303-305&lt;/ref&gt; The year before the CBM-BNA had warned of the risk of toxic microalgal [[Aphanizomenon spp]] blooms in reservoirs on the island of [[Grand Canary]]. When the bloom of toxic [[cyanobacteria]] became evident three months later, the drainage basin had to be closed off and irrigation suspended.
There are certified reports of hospitalizations in the Canaries due to the consumption of fish containing microalgal toxins.
The risks of HAB (Harmful Algal Blooms) and their increased incidence due to [[climate change]] started to be taken seriously by government officials.

2005.- BNA was accredited as an International Depositary Authority for the purposes of patent procedure. The complex process to accredit the BNA/CBM as an International Depositary Authority (for patent purposes) pursuant to the Budapest Treaty &lt;ref name=Budapest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/registration/budapest |title=Accreditation as International Depositary Authority|accessdate=26 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; successfully culminated on 28 October 2005 with the publication of its accreditation in the [[WIPO]] ([[World Intellectual Property Organization]]) Official Bulletin (Budapest Notification No. 239).&lt;ref name=notification&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/notifications/budapest/treaty_budapest_239.html |title=Publication of accreditation in the WIPO Official Bulletin|accessdate=26 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BNA organized the Tropical and Subtropical Cyanoprokaryota Workshop 2005 (TSCW2005), in cooperation with Proexca, the Industry Council of Grand Canary, Caja Rural de Canarias Foundation, La Caixa, the ULPGC Board, the Ocean Sciences Department of the [[ULPGC]] and the spin-off company Seaweed Canarias.

2007.- The [[Ministry of Education, Social Policy and Sport of Spain|MEC]] provided funds for staffing one Scientific-Technological Infrastructure Specialist at the National Bank of Algae (BNA).

2009.- The Minister of Science and Innovation, [[Cristina Garmendia|Dr. Cristina Garmendia]], announced the consolidation of the BNA-CBM. “The BNA will serve as a national research service to promote microalgae-based bio-industries, it will create and maintain its own collection, taking advantage of Spanish oceanographic expeditions, and it will provide samples to laboratories and companies that so request them for study and eventual technical applications”.

In late 2009, the [[Government of Spain]] (Ministry of Innovation and Science [MICINN]) finalized a 2.6 M€ grant for the consolidation of the BNA&lt;ref name=grant&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.micinn.es/stfls/MICINN/Prensa/FICHEROS/2009/NP%20Garmendia%20y%20Presidente%20de%20Canarias.pdf |title=Grant from the Ministry of Innovation and Science |accessdate=26 December 2011 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120160453/http://www.micinn.es/stfls/MICINN/Prensa/FICHEROS/2009/NP%20Garmendia%20y%20Presidente%20de%20Canarias.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (23 July 2009), as part of the PLAN-E microalgae project.&lt;ref name=PLANE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2009-15770 |title=PLAN E microalgae project|accessdate=26 December 2011 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBM is included in the Canaries Marine Development Complex, located in [[Taliarte]] (SE coast of [[Grand Canary]]), and the emerging BNA backs the joint request made to the MICINN by the [[ULPGC]] and the [[University of La Laguna]] (ULL) to classify the Tricontinental Campus as a “campus of excellence”.

2010.- In March 2010, contracts were finalized and remodeling work had begun on the CBM-BNA laboratories as part of a Plan-E Project, which was initially scheduled for completion in December 2010, though the deadline was later extended until December 2011. The remodeling work (the deadline extension was not implemented) was completed on 16 December (the scientific work of the CBM-BNA did not stop in 2010, since every available inch of the laboratories on the ground floor and the second floor hallways were turned into offices, classrooms and bathrooms ).
Doctors [[Michael Melkonian]] and Barbara Melkonian ([[University of Cologne]], Germany) made a sabbatical stay (September 2010 to March 2011) at BNA.

2011.- By February  growth chambers, equipments and basic [[microalgae]] cultivation systems were operating. In May the organization was officially renamed to Spanish Bank of Algae (BEA). On June 2, the authorisation to publish the BEA website was granted, which includes catalogs of products and services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13026">The '''standard step method (STM)''' is a computational technique utilized to estimate one-dimensional surface water profiles in open channels with gradually varied flow under steady state conditions.  It uses a combination of the energy, momentum, and continuity equations to determine water depth with a given a friction slope &lt;math&gt;(S_f)&lt;/math&gt;, channel slope &lt;math&gt;(S_0)&lt;/math&gt;, channel geometry, and also a given flow rate.  In practice, this technique is widely used through the computer program [[HEC-RAS]], developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=USACE|title=HEC-RAS Version 4.1 User's Manual|publisher=Hydrologic Engineering Center, Davis, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open channel flow fundamentals ==

[[File:Open Channel Flow Energy Lines.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Conceptual figure used to define terms in the energy equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaudhry|first=M.H.|title=Open-Channel Flow|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:E-y Diagram.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' A diagram showing the relationship for flow depth (y) and total Energy (E) for a given flow (Q).  Note the location of cricital flow, subcritical flow, and supercritical flow.]]

The energy equation used for [[open channel flow]] computations is a simplification of the Bernoulli Equation (See [[Bernoulli Principle]]), which takes into account pressure head, elevation head, and velocity head.  (Note, energy and head are synonymous in Fluid Dynamics.  See [[Pressure head]] for more details.)   In open channels, it is assumed that changes in atmospheric pressure are negligible, therefore the “pressure head” term used in Bernoulli’s Equation is eliminated.  The resulting energy equation is shown below:

:&lt;math&gt;H = z+y+\frac{v^2}{2g}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;big&gt;'''Equation 1'''&lt;/big&gt;

For a given flow rate and channel geometry, there is a relationship between flow depth and total energy.   This is illustrated below in the plot of energy vs. flow depth, widely known as an E-y diagram.  In this plot, the depth where the minimum energy occurs is known as the critical depth.  Consequently, this depth corresponds to a [[Froude Number]] &lt;math&gt;(F_n)&lt;/math&gt; of 1.  Depths greater than critical depth are considered “subcritical” and have a Froude Number less than 1, while depths less than critical depth are considered supercritical and have Froude Numbers greater than 1.  (For more information, see [[Dimensionless Specific Energy Diagrams for Open Channel Flow]].)

:&lt;math&gt;F_n=\frac{v}{(g\frac{A}{B})^{0.5}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;big&gt;'''Equation 2'''&lt;/big&gt;

Under steady state flow conditions (e.g. no flood wave), open channel flow can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow.  Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel.  This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope.  During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn).  This depth is analogous to the terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moglen|first=G.|title=Lecture Notes from CEE 4324/5894: Open Channel Flow, Virginia Tech|url=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/moglen/ocf/index.html|accessdate=April 24, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105134341/http://filebox.vt.edu/users/moglen/ocf/index.html|archivedate=November 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, this depth is calculated using the [[Manning formula]].  Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small.  In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply.  Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope.  Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed.   Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.

== Water surface profiles (gradually varied flow) ==

Typically, the STM is used to develop “surface water profiles,” or longitudinal representations of channel depth, for channels experiencing gradually varied flow.  These transitions can be classified based on reach condition (mild or steep), and also the type of transition being made.  Mild reaches occur where normal depth is subcritical (yn &gt; yc) while steep reaches occur where normal depth is supercritical (yn&lt;yc).  The transitions are classified by zone.  (See figure 3.)

[[File:Surface Water Profiles.jpg|Surface Water Profiles]]

'''Figure 3.'''  This figure illustrates the different classes of surface water profiles experienced in steep and mild reaches during gradually varied flow conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chow|first=V.T.|title=Open-Channel Hydraulics|year=1959|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note: The Steep Reach column should be labeled "Steep Reach (yn&lt;yc).

The above surface water profiles are based on the governing equation for gradually varied flow (seen below)

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{S_0 - S_f}{1-F_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;big&gt;'''Equation 3'''&lt;/big&gt;

This equation (and associated surface water profiles) is based on the following assumptions:

:* The slope is relatively small
:* Channel cross-section is known at stations of interest
:* There is a hydrostatic pressure distribution

== Standard step method calculation ==

The STM numerically solves equation 3 through an iterative process.  This can be done using the bisection or Newton-Raphson Method, and is essentially solving for total head at a specified location using equations 4 and 5 by varying depth at the specified location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaudhry|first=M.H.|title=Open-Channel Flow|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_2 = H_1 - h_f&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;big&gt;'''Equation 4'''&lt;/big&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_2 = h_{vel} + h_{ele}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;big&gt;'''Equation 5'''&lt;/big&gt;

In order to use this technique, it is important to note you must have some understanding of the system you are modeling.  For each gradually varied flow transition, you must know both boundary conditions and you must also calculate length of that transition.  (e.g. For an M1 Profile, you must find the rise at the downstream boundary condition, the normal depth at the upstream boundary condition, and also the length of the transition.)  To find the length of the gradually varied flow transitions, iterate the “step length”, instead of height, at the boundary condition height until equations 4 and 5 agree.  (e.g. For an M1 Profile, position 1 would be the downstream condition and you would solve for position two where the height is equal to normal depth.)

=== Newton–Raphson numerical method ===

[[File:NewtonRaphsonMethod.jpg|NewtonRaphsonMethod]]

Computer programs like excel contain iteration or goal seek functions that can automatically calculate the actual depth instead of manual iteration.

=== Conceptual surface water profiles (sluice gate) ===

[[File:Sluice Gate Sketch.jpg|thumb| '''Figure 4.''' Illustration of surface water profiles associated with a sluice gate in a mild reach (top) and a steep reach (bottom).]]
Figure 4 illustrates the different surface water profiles associated with a sluice gate on a mild reach (top) and a steep reach (bottom).  Note, the sluice gate induces a choke in the system, causing a “backwater” profile just upstream of the gate.  In the mild reach, the [[hydraulic jump]] occurs downstream of the gate, but in the steep reach, the hydraulic jump occurs upstream of the gate.  It is important to note that the gradually varied flow equations and associated numerical methods (including the standard step method) cannot accurately model the dynamics of a hydraulic jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaudhry|first=M.H.|title=Open-Channel Flow|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See the [[Hydraulic jumps in rectangular channels]] page for more information. Below, an example problem will use conceptual models to build a surface water profile using the STM.

== Example problem ==

&lt;big&gt;'''Solution'''

&lt;/big&gt;

[[File:Large Standard Step Method Step 1.jpg|650px|Calculations necessary for the first step in the standard step method]]


[[File:Large Standart Step Method Step 2 drawing.jpg|650px|Calculations necessary for the second step in the standard step method]]


[[File:Large Standard Step Method Step 3.jpg|650px|Calculations necessary for the third step in the standard step method]]


Using Figure 3 and knowledge of the upstream and downstream conditions and the depth values on either side of the gate, a general estimate of the profiles upstream and downstream of the gate can be generated. Upstream, the water surface must rise from a normal depth of 0.97 m to 9.21 m at the gate. The only way to do this on a mild reach is to follow an M1 profile. The same logic applies downstream to determine that the water surface follows an M3 profile from the gate until the depth reaches the conjugate depth of the normal depth at which point a hydraulic jump forms to raise the water surface to the normal depth.

'''Step 4:'''  Use the Newton Raphson Method to solve the M1 and M3 surface water profiles. The upstream and downstream portions must be modeled separately with an initial depth of 9.21 m for the upstream portion, and 0.15 m for the downstream portion. The downstream depth should only be modeled until it reaches the conjugate depth of the normal depth, at which point a hydraulic jump will form. The solution presented explains how to solve the problem in a spreadsheet, showing the calculations column by column. Within Excel, the goal seek function can be used to set column 15 to 0 by changing the depth estimate in column 2 instead of iterating manually.

[[File:Downstream Water Surface Profile.jpg|650px|Profile downstream]]

Normal depth was achieved at approximately 2,200 meters upstream of the gate.

'''Step 6:''' Solve the problem in the HEC-RAS Modeling Environment:

It is beyond the scope of this Wikipedia Page to explain the intricacies of operating HEC-RAS.  For those interested in learning more, the HEC-RAS user’s manual is an excellent learning tool and the program is free to the public.  

The first two figures below are the upstream and downstream water surface profiles modeled by HEC-RAS. There is also a table provided comparing the differences between the profiles estimated by the two different methods at different stations to show consistency between the two methods.  While the two different methods modeled similar water surface shapes, the standard step method predicted that the flow would take a greater distance to reach normal depth upstream and downstream of the gate. This stretching is caused by the errors associated with assuming average gradients between two stations of interest during our calculations. Smaller dx values would reduce this error and produce more accurate surface profiles.  

[[File:HEC-RAS Modle Upstream gate.jpg|650px|HEC-RAS upstream]]

[[File:HEC-RAS model Downstream of gate with jump.jpg|650px|HEC-RAS Downstream]]

The HEC-RAS model calculated that the water backs up to a height of 9.21 meters at the upstream side of the sluice gate, which is the same as the manually calculated value. Normal depth was achieved at approximately 1,700 meters upstream of the gate.

HEC-RAS modeled the hydraulic jump to occur 18 meters downstream of the sluice gate.

[[File:Steinschlag_Autoscheibe.jpg|thumb|Stone damage on a [[windshield]]]]

'''Stone damage''', or '''stone-chip''', is the damage that [[gravel]] and small stones can make to a [[vehicle]].

Stone damage is most common on roads on which the allowed speed exceeds {{convert|70|km/h|mph}}, since stones stuck in the tires come loose at that speed and fly away with such a speed that they can damage other vehicles.

Stone damage can be dangerous in many ways. Stone damage can cause small cracks in the [[windshield]] that can [[Refraction|refract]] or [[Specular reflection|reflect]] normally unharmful light such that it can distract or blind the driver. Stone damage can also cause large cracks in the windshield – this usually happens during the winter period because of the large temperature differences, but can also happen if the vehicle is exposed to vibrations or bumps.

A factor that contributes to stone damage on the windshield is the fact that modern cars normally use quite thin windshields to save weight. Modern tires also contribute to stone damage since they have more tracks in which stones can get stuck.

At high [[temperatures]] and [[pressures]], such as in the interior of [[giant planets]], it is argued that water exists as ionic water in which the [[molecule]]s break down into a soup of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ions. At even higher pressures, ionic water will further condense into superionic water, where the oxygen [[crystallization|crystallises]] and the hydrogen [[ions]] float around freely within the oxygen [[Crystal structure|lattice]].&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727764.500-weird-water-lurking-inside-giant-planets.html Weird water lurking inside giant planets], New Scientist,01 September 2010, Magazine issue 2776.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
Superionic water was previously [[theory|theoretical]], but [[Predictions#Prediction in science|predictions]] were made about its [[Physical property|properties]].  If it were present on [[Earth]], it would rapidly [[Decompression (physics)|decompress]] and [[Explosion|explode]].  Under the conditions theorized to cause water to enter the phase, it is believed that superionic water would be as hard as [[iron]] and would glow yellow.&lt;ref name="nature.com" /&gt; 

{{As of|2013}} it is theorized that superionic ice can possess two crystalline structures.  At pressures in excess of 0.5 Mbar it is predicted that superionic ice would take on a [[body-centered cubic]] structure.  However, at pressures in excess of 1 Mbar it is predicted that the structure would shift to a more stable [[face-centered cubic]] lattice.&lt;ref name=Phys.org-2013-04-25&gt;Phys.org, [http://phys.org/news/2013-04-phase-dominate-interiors-uranus-neptune.html "New phase of water could dominate the interiors of Uranus and Neptune"], Lisa Zyga, 25 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of theoretical and experimental evidence ==
Demontis, et al. made the first prediction for superionic water using classical molecular dynamics simulations that were published in Physical Review Letters in 1988 &lt;ref name="Demontis"&gt;[http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.2284 New high-pressure phases of ice], P. Demontis, R. LeSar, and M. L. Klein, Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 60, no. 22, pp. 2284–2287, May 1988&lt;/ref&gt;.
In 1999 Cavazzoni, et al. predicted that such a state would exist for [[ammonia]] and [[water]] in conditions such as those existing on [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name="Cavazzoni"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/283/5398/44 Superionic and Metallic States of Water and Ammonia at Giant Planet Conditions], Cavazzoni C., et al. Science, 283. 44 - 46&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 2005 Laurence Fried led a team at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[California]] to recreate the formative conditions of superionic water.  Using a technique involving smashing water molecules between [[diamond]]s and super heating it with [[laser]]s they observed frequency shifts which indicated that a [[phase transition]] had taken place.  The team also created [[computer model]]s which indicated that they had indeed created superionic water.&lt;ref name="nature.com" /&gt;  In 2013 Hugh F. Wilson, Michael L. Wong, and Burkhard Militzer at the University of California, Berkeley published a paper predicting the [[face-centered cubic]] lattice structure that would emerge at higher pressures.&lt;ref name=Phys.org-2013-04-25/&gt;

Additional experimental evidence was found by Marius Millot and colleagues in 2018, in an article in [[Nature Physics]], by inducing high pressure on water between diamonds and then shocking the water using a laser pulse.&lt;ref name="NP-20180205"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Millot, Marius et al. |title=Experimental evidence for superionic water ice using shock compression |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-017-0017-4 |date=5 February 2018 |journal=[[Nature Physics]] |doi=10.1038/s41567-017-0017-4 |accessdate=5 February 2018 |bibcode=2018NatPh..14..297M }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== February 2018 experiment ==
The most recent experiment was conducted at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]] by squeezing water between two pieces of diamond with a pressure of 360,000 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]. The water was squeezed into [[Ice VII|type VII ice]] which is 60 percent denser than normal water.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/science/superionic-water-neptune-uranus.html|title=New Form of Water, Both Liquid and Solid, Is ‘Really Strange’|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|date=2018-02-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The compressed ice was then transported to the [[University of Rochester]] where it was blasted by a pulse of laser light. The reaction created conditions like those inside of [[ice giant]]s such as Uranus and Neptune by heating up the ice thousands of degrees under a pressure a million times greater than the earth's atmosphere in only ten to 20 billionths of a second. 

The experiment concluded that the current in the conductive water was indeed carried by ions rather than electrons and thus pointed to the water being superionic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Existence in ice giants ==
It is theorized that the [[ice giant]] planets [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] hold a layer of superionic water.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Livermore"&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Osolin |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/newsreleases/2005/SF-05-04-01.html |title=Public Affairs Office: Recreating the Bizarre State of Water Found on Giant Planets |publisher=Llnl.gov |accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there are also studies that suggest that other elements present inside the interiors of these planets, particularly [[carbon]], may prevent the formation of superionic water.&lt;ref name="Chau"&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1198 Chemical processes in the deep interior of Uranus], Ricky Chau, Sebastien Hamel &amp; William J.

The tailings heaps stretch across this image.&lt;!--are these overburden or tailings?--&gt;]]

'''Tailings''', also called '''mine dumps''', '''culm dumps''', '''slimes''', '''tails''', '''refuse''', '''leach residue''' or '''slickens''', '''terra-cone (terrikon)''', are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction ([[gangue]]) of an [[ore]]. Tailings are distinct from [[overburden]], which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.

The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: [[placer mining]], which uses water and gravity to concentrate the valuable minerals, or [[hard rock mining]], which pulverizes the rock containing the ore and then relies on chemical reactions to concentrate the sought-after material.  In the latter, the extraction of minerals from ore requires [[comminution]], i.e., grinding the ore into fine particles to facilitate extraction of the target element(s).  Because of this comminution, tailings consist of a slurry of fine particles, ranging from the size of a grain of sand to a few micrometres.&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams/&gt; Mine tailings are usually produced from the [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] in [[slurry]] form, which is a mixture of fine mineral particles and water.

==Examples==

===Sulfide minerals===
The effluent from the tailings from the mining of sulfidic minerals has been described as "the largest environmental liability of the mining industry".&lt;ref&gt;Nehdi, Moncef; Tariq, Amjad "Stabilization of sulphidic mine tailings for prevention of metal release and acid drainage using cementitious materials: a review" Journal of Environmental Engineering and Science (2007), 6(4), 423-436.  {{DOI|10.1139/S06-060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tailings contain large amounts of [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Iron(II) sulfide]] (FeS), which are rejected from the sought-after ores of copper and nickel, as well as coal. Although harmless underground, these minerals are reactive toward air in the presence of microorganisms, leading to [[acid mine drainage]].
[[File:Iron hydroxide precipitate in stream.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yellow boy]] in a stream receiving [[acid mine drainage]] from surface coal mining.]]

===Coal and oil sands===
When applied to [[Coal mining|coal mining tailings ponds]] and [[oil sands tailings ponds]], the term "tailings" refers to fine waste suspended in water.&lt;ref name=disposal&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3869384.html United States Patent 3869384 Tailings disposal system for tar sands plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aluminium mining===
[[File:Luftaufnahmen Nordseekueste 2012-05-by-RaBoe-478.jpg|thumb|Bauxite tailings near [[Stade]] ([[Germany]])]]
[[Bauxite tailings]] is a [[waste]] product generated in the industrial production of [[aluminium]]. Making provision for the approximately 77 million tons that is produced annually is one of the most significant problems for the aluminium [[mining]] industry.&lt;ref name=Ayr&gt;Ayres, R. U., Holmberg, J., Andersson, B., "Materials and the global environment: Waste mining in the 21st century", MRS Bull. 2001, 26, 477.  {{DOI|10.1557/mrs2001.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
Early mining operations often did not take adequate steps to make tailings areas environmentally safe after closure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fse.org.za/downloads/SIDINT%20Mine%20Closure.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epsjournal.org.uk/abs/Vol2/No2/eps_v2n2_Adler_et_al.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226181537/http://www.epsjournal.org.uk/abs/Vol2/No2/eps_v2n2_Adler_et_al.pdf |date=26 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern mines, particularly those in jurisdictions with well-developed mining regulations and those operated by responsible mining companies, often include the rehabilitation and proper closure of tailings areas in their costs and activities. For example, the Province of [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], requires not only the submission of a closure plan before the start of mining activity, but also the deposit of a financial guarantee equal to 100% of the estimated rehabilitation costs.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife, [http://www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/english/mines/quebec-mines/2011-06/bill.asp "Bill 14: creating a foundation for an innovative mining development model"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tailings#Tailings ponds or impoundments|Tailings dams]] are often the most significant environmental liability for a mining project.&lt;ref name=StewardDams&gt;TE Martin, MP Davies. (2000). [http://www.infomine.com/publications/docs/Martin2000.pdf Trends in the stewardship of tailings dams].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental considerations and case studies==
The fraction of tailings to ore can range from 90–98% for some copper ores to 20–50% of the other (less valuable) minerals.&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Nagaraj "Minerals Recovery and Processing" in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Wiley-VCH {{DOI|10.1002/0471238961.1309140514010701.a01.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rejected minerals and rocks liberated through mining and processing have the potential to damage the environment by releasing toxic metals (arsenic and mercury being two major culprits), by acid drainage (usually by microbial action on sulfide ores), or by damaging aquatic wildlife that rely on clear water (vs suspensions).&lt;ref name="Franks"&gt;Franks, DM, Boger, DV, Côte, CM, Mulligan, DR. 2011. Sustainable Development Principles for the Disposal of Mining and Mineral Processing Wastes. Resources Policy. Vol. 36. No. 2. pp 114-122&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest danger of tailings ponds is dam failure, with the most publicized failure in the U.S. being the failure of a coal slurry dam in the [[West Virginia]] [[Buffalo Creek Flood]], which killed 125 people; other collapses include the [[Ok Tedi environmental disaster]] in [[New Guinea]], which destroyed the fishery of the [[Ok Tedi River]]. On average, worldwide, there is one big accident involving a tailings dam each year.&lt;ref name="collapse"&gt;{{cite book|title=Collapse|author=Jared Diamond|year=2005|publisher=Penguin}}, page 452-458&lt;/ref&gt; Tailings ponds can also be a source of [[acid drainage]], leading to the need for permanent monitoring and treatment of water passing through the tailings dam; the cost of mine cleanup has typically been 10 times that of mining industry estimates when acid drainage was involved.&lt;ref name="collapse"/&gt; Other disasters caused by tailings dam failures are, [[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill|the 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill]] and [[Ajka alumina plant accident|the Ajka alumina plant accident]]. (See also [[List of tailings dam failures]].)

== Storage methods ==
Historically, tailings were disposed of in the most convenient manner, such as in downstream running water or down [[Drainage|drains]]. Because of concerns about these sediments in the water and other issues, tailings ponds came into use.  The sustainability challenge in the management of tailings and waste rock is to dispose of material, such that it is inert or, if not, stable and contained, to minimise water and energy inputs and the surface footprint of wastes and to move toward finding alternate uses.&lt;ref name="Franks" /&gt;

===Tailings ponds or impoundments===
:{{see main|Tailings dam}}
Bounded by impoundments (an impoundment is a dam), these dams typically use "local materials" including the tailings themselves, and may be considered [[embankment dam]]s.&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams/&gt; Traditionally, the only option for tailings storage was to deal with a tailings slurry.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} This slurry is a dilute stream of the tailings solids within water that was sent to the tailings storage area. The modern tailings designer has a range of tailings products to choose from depending upon how much water is removed from the slurry prior to discharge.   The removal of water not only can create a better storage system in some cases (e.g. dry stacking, see below) but can also assist in water recovery which is a major issue as many mines are in arid regions. In a 1994 description of tailings impoundments, however, the U.S. EPA stated that dewatering methods may be prohibitively expensive except in special circumstances.&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams/&gt; Subaqueous storage of tailings has also been used.&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams/&gt;
[[File:Gold King Mine Spill Emergency Retaining Ponds.JPG|thumb|Emergency tailing ponds constructed in response to the [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill|2015 Gold King Mine Spill]] in Colorado, pictured on August 7, 2015. The ponds were constructed to contain a spill created by EPA workers, while trying to install a cleanup system on the main tailing pond for the long closed mine.]]
Tailing ponds are areas of refused [[mining]] tailings where the waterborne refuse material is pumped into a [[pond]] to allow the [[sedimentation]] (meaning separation) of solids from the water. The pond is generally impounded with a dam, and known as tailings impoundments or tailings dams.&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams&gt;US EPA. (1994). [http://epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/industrial/special/mining/techdocs/tailings.pdf Technical Report: Design and Evaluation of Tailings Dams] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510155552/http://epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/industrial/special/mining/techdocs/tailings.pdf |date=10 May 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated in 2000 that there were about 3,500 active tailings impoundments in the world.&lt;ref name=StewardDams/&gt; The ponded water is of some benefit as it minimizes fine tailings from being transported by wind into populated areas where the toxic chemicals could be potentially hazardous to human health; however, it is also harmful to the environment. Tailing ponds are often somewhat dangerous because they attract wildlife such as waterfowl or caribou as they appear to be a natural pond, but they can be highly toxic and harmful to the health of these animals. Tailings ponds are used to store the waste made from separating minerals from rocks, or the slurry produced from tar sands mining. Tailings are sometimes mixed with other materials such as [[bentonite]] to form a thicker slurry that slows the release of impacted water to the environment.

There are many different subsets of this method, including valley impoundments, ring dikes, in-pit impoundments, and specially dug pits.&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams/&gt; The most common is the valley pond, which takes advantage of the natural topographical depression in the ground.&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams/&gt; Large earthen dams may be constructed and then filled with the tailings. Exhausted open pit mines may be refilled with tailings. In all instances, due consideration must be made to contamination of the underlying water table, amongst other issues. Dewatering is an important part of pond storage, as the tailings are added to the storage facility the water is removed - usually by draining into decant tower structures. The water removed can thus be reused in the processing cycle. Once a storage facility is filled and completed, the surface can be covered with topsoil and revegetation commenced. However, unless a non-permeable capping method is used, water that infiltrates into the storage facility will have to be continually pumped out into the future.

===Paste tailings===
Paste tailings is a modification to the conventional methods of disposal of tailings (pond storage). Conventional tailings slurries are composed of a low percent of solids and relatively high water content (normally ranging from 20% to 60% solids for most hard rock mining) and when deposited into the tailings pond the solids and liquids separate. In paste tailings the percent of solids in the tailings slurry is increased through the use of paste thickeners to produce a product where the minimal separation of water and solids occurs and the material is deposited into a storage area as a paste (with a consistency somewhat like toothpaste). Paste tailings has the advantage that more water is recycled in the processing plant and therefore the process is more water efficient than conventional tailings and there is a lower potential for seepage. However the cost of the thickening is generally higher than for conventional tailings and the pumping costs for the paste  are also normally higher than for conventional tailings as positive displacement pumps are normally required to transport the tailings from the processing plant to the storage area. Paste tailings are used in several locations around the world including Sunrise Dam in Western Australia and Bulyanhulu Gold Mine in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1 = J. A. | last1 = Theriault | last2= Frostiak |first2=J. |last3=Welch |first3=D. | title = Surface Disposal of Paste Tailings at the Bulyanhulu Gold Mine, Tanzania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry stacking===
Tailings do not have to be stored in ponds or sent as slurries into oceans, rivers or streams. There is a growing use of the practice of dewatering tailings using vacuum or pressure filters so the tailings can then be stacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = M. P. | last = Davies |last2=Rice |first2=S.  | title = An alternative to conventional tailing management - "dry stack" filtered tailings | conference = Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Tailings and Mine Waste | pages = 411–422 | publisher = Balkema | date = 16–19 January 2001 | location = Fort Collins, Colorado, US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This saves water which potentially reduces the impacts on the environment in terms of a reduction in the potential seepage rates, space used, leaves the tailings in a dense and stable arrangement and eliminates the long-term liability that ponds leave after mining is finished. However although there are potential merits to  dry stacked tailings these systems are often cost prohibitive due to increased capital cost to purchase and install the filter systems and the increase in operating costs (generally associated electricity consumption and consumables such as filter cloth) of such systems.

===Storage in underground workings===
While disposal into exhausted open pits is generally a straightforward operation, disposal into underground voids is more complex. A common modern approach is to mix a certain quantity of tailings with waste aggregate and cement, creating a product that can be used to backfill underground voids and [[Stoping (mining method)|stopes]]. A common term for this is HDPF - High Density Paste Fill. HDPF is a more expensive method of tailings disposal than pond storage, however it has many other benefits – not just environmental but it can significantly increase the stability of underground excavations by providing a means for ground stress to be transmitted across voids - rather than having to pass around them – which can cause mining induced seismic events like that suffered previously at the [[Beaconsfield Mine Disaster]].

===Riverine tailings===
Usually called RTD – Riverine Tailings Disposal. In most environments, not a particularly environmentally sound practice, it has seen significant utilisation in the past, leading to such spectacular environmental damage as done by the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]] in [[Tasmania]] to the [[King River (Tasmania)|King River]], or the poisoning from the [[Panguna]] mine on [[Bougainville Island]], which led to large-scale civil unrest on the island, and the eventual permanent closing of the mine.&lt;ref name="collapse" /&gt;

As of 2005, only three mines operated by international companies continued to use river disposal: The [[Ok Tedi mine]], the [[Grasberg mine]]&lt;ref name="collapse" /&gt; and the [[Porgera Gold Mine|Porgera mine]], all on New Guinea. This method is used in these cases due to seismic activity and landslide dangers which make other disposal methods impractical and dangerous.

===Submarine tailings===
Commonly referred to as STD (Submarine Tailings Disposal) or DSTD (Deep Sea Tailings Disposal). Tailings can be conveyed using a pipeline then discharged so as to eventually descend into the depths. Practically, it is not an ideal method, as the close proximity to off-shelf depths is rare. When STD is used, the depth of discharge is often what would be considered{{by whom|date=August 2015}} shallow, and extensive damage to the seafloor can result due to covering by the tailings product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Association|first1=California Mining|title=Mine waste management|date=1991|publisher=Lewis Publishers|location=Chelsea, Mich.|isbn=9780873717465}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also critical{{according to|date=August 2015}} to control the density and temperature of the tailings product, to prevent it from travelling long distances, or even floating to the surface.

This method is used by the gold mine on [[Lihir Island]]; its waste disposal has been viewed by environmentalists as highly damaging, while the owners claim that it is not harmful.&lt;ref name="collapse" /&gt;

=== Phytostabilisation ===
Phytostabilisation is a form of [[phytoremediation]] that uses [[hyperaccumulator|hyperaccumulator plants]] for long-term stabilisation and containment of tailings, by sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots. The plant's presence can reduce wind erosion, or the plant's roots can prevent water erosion, immobilise metals by adsorption or accumulation, and provide a zone around the roots where the metals can precipitate and stabilise. Pollutants become less bioavailable and livestock, wildlife, and human exposure is reduced. This approach can be especially useful in dry environments, which are subject to wind and water dispersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |year=2008 |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=278–83 |title= Phytostabilization of Mine Tailings in Arid and Semiarid Environments—An Emerging Remediation Technology |author=Mendez MO, Maier RM |doi=10.1289/ehp.10608 |pmid= 18335091 |pmc= 2265025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different methods===
Considerable effort and research continues to be made into discovering and refining better methods of tailings disposal. Research at the Porgera Gold Mine is focusing on developing a method of combining tailings products with coarse waste rock and waste muds to create a product that can be stored on the surface in generic-looking waste dumps or stockpiles. This would allow the current use of rivering disposal to cease. Considerable work remains to be done.   However, co-disposal has been successfully implemented by several designers including [[AMEC]] at, for example, the Elkview Mine in British Columbia.

== Reprocessing ==
As mining techniques and the price of minerals improve, it is not unusual for tailings to be reprocessed using new methods, or more thoroughly with old methods, to recover additional minerals. Extensive tailings dumps of [[Kalgoorlie]] / Boulder in Western Australia were re-processed profitably in the 1990s by KalTails Mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tailings.info/kaltails.htm|title=Kaltails project, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|author=J.Engels &amp; D.Dixon-Hardy|accessdate=19 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124082713/http://www.tailings.info/kaltails.htm|archive-date=24 January 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A machine called the PET4K Processing Plant has been used in a variety of countries for the past 20 years to remediate contaminated tailings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/can-african-machine-produce-a-promising-future-in-butte/article_a2d81c9d-38ec-5262-ad36-2b8ac9ed27fa.html#tncms-source=infinity-scroll-summary-siderail-latest|title=Can African machine produce a promising future in Butte?|last=Smith|first=Mike|date=2017-09-25|work=[[Missoulian]]|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pond reclamation by microbiology==
During extraction of the oil from oil sand, tailings consisting of water, silt, clays and other solvents are also created. This solid will become mature fine tailings by gravity. Foght ''et al'' (1985) estimated that there are 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; anaerobic [[heterotrophs]] and 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; sulfate-reducing [[prokaryotes]] per milliliter in the tailings pond, based on conventional most probable number methods. Foght set up an experiment with two tailings ponds and an analysis of the [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and the gas released from tailings ponds showed that those were [[methanogens]]. As the depth increased, the moles of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; released actually decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Foght, J.M., Fedorak, P.M., Westlake, D.W.S., and Boerger, H.J. 1985. '' Microbial content and metabolic activities in the Syncrude tailings pond.'' AOSTRA J. Res. 1: 139–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siddique (2006, 2007) states that methanogens in the tailings pond live and reproduce by anaerobic degradation, which will lower the molecular weight from [[naphtha]] to [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]], aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and methane. Those archaea and bacteria can degrade the naphtha, which was considered as waste during the procedure of refining oil. Both of those degraded products are useful. Aliphatic, aromatic hydrocarbons and methane can be used as fuel in the humans’ daily lives. In other words, these methanogens improve the coefficient of utilization. Moreover, these methanogens change the structure of the tailings pond and help the pore water efflux to be reused for processing oil sands. Because the archaea and bacteria metabolize and release bubbles within the tailings, the pore water can go through the soil easily. Since they accelerate the densification of mature fine tailings, the tailings ponds are enabled to settle the solids more quickly so that the tailings can be reclaimed earlier. Moreover, the water released from the tailings can be used in the procedure of refining oil. Reducing the demand of water can also protect the environment from drought.&lt;ref&gt;See: Holowenko, F.M., MacKinnon, M.D., and Fedorak, P.M. 2000. ''Methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria in oil sands fine tailings waste.'' Can. J. Microbiol. 46(10): 927–937. {{doi|10.1139/cjm-46-10-927}}. {{PMID|11068680}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[radio|radio transmission]], '''transmitter power output''' ('''TPO''') is the actual amount of [[power (physics)|power]] (in [[watt]]s) of [[radio frequency]] (RF) energy that a [[transmitter]] produces at its output.

This is not the amount of power that a [[radio station]] reports as its power, as in "we're 100,000 watts of rock 'n' roll", which is usually the [[effective radiated power]] (ERP). The TPO for VHF-/UHF-transmitters is normally more than the ERP, for LF-/MF-transmitters it has nearly the same value, while for VLF-transmitters it may be less.

The [[radio antenna]]'s design "focuses" the [[signaling (telecommunications)|signal]] toward the [[horizon]], creating [[Antenna gain|gain]] and increasing the ERP. There is also some loss (negative gain) from the [[feedline]], which reduces some of the TPO to the antenna by both [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] and by [[radiant energy|radiating]] a small part of the signal.

The basic [[equation]] relating transmitter to effective power is: 

::&lt;math&gt;TPO\ \times\ loss_{feedline}\ \times\ gain_{antenna}\ =\ ERP&lt;/math&gt;
Note that in this formula the Antenna Gain is expressed with reference to a tuned dipole ([[Antenna gain#Figures used for antenna gain|dBd]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6988">[[File:Biome_map_02.svg|thumb|right|310px|Extent of dry forest regions]]

The '''tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forest''' [[biome]], also known as '''tropical dry forest''', '''monsoon forest''', '''vine thicket''', '''vine scrub''' and '''dry rainforest''' is located at tropical and subtropical latitudes. Though these forests occur in climates that are warm year-round, and may receive several hundred centimeters of rain per year, they have  long [[dry season]]s which last several months and vary with geographic location. These seasonal [[droughts]] have great impact on all living animals and plants in the forest.

[[Deciduous]] trees predominate in most of these forests, and during the drought a leafless period occurs, which varies with species type. Because trees lose moisture through their leaves, the shedding of leaves allows trees such as [[teak]] and [[mountain ebony]] to conserve water during dry periods. The newly bare trees open up the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] layer, enabling [[sunlight]] to reach ground level and facilitate the growth of thick [[underbrush]]. Trees on moister sites and those with access to ground water tend to be [[evergreen]]. Infertile sites also tend to support evergreen trees. Three tropical dry broadleaf forest ecoregions, the [[East Deccan dry evergreen forests]], the [[Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests]], and the [[Southeastern Indochina dry evergreen forests]], are characterized by evergreen trees.

Though less biologically diverse than [[rainforest]]s, tropical dry forests are home to a wide variety of wildlife including [[monkey]]s, [[deer]], large [[cat]]s, [[parrot]]s, various [[rodent]]s, and ground dwelling [[bird]]s. Mammalian [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] tends to be higher in dry forests than in rain forests, especially in Asian and African dry forests. Many of these [[species]] display extraordinary adaptations to the difficult [[climate]].

This biome is alternately known as the '''tropical bane forest''' biome or the '''tropical and subtropical deciduous forest''' biome{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

==Geographical variation==
{{see also|Global_200#Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests}}
[[File:Chacachacare dry forest 3.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Trinidad and Tobago dry forests|Trinidad and Tobago dry forest]] on [[Chacachacare]] showing the dry-season deciduous nature of the vegetation]]
Dry forests tend to exist in the drier areas north and south of the [[tropical rainforest]] belt, south or north of the subtropical deserts, generally in two bands: one between 10° and 20°N [[latitude]] and the other between 10° and 20°S [[latitude]]. The most diverse dry forests in the world occur in southern [[Mexico]] and in the [[Bolivia]]n lowlands. The dry forests of the [[Pacific Coast]] of northwestern [[South America]] support a wealth of unique species due to their dry climate. The [[Maputaland-Pondoland bushland and thickets]] along the east coast of [[South Africa]] are diverse and support many [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species. The dry forests of central [[India]] and [[Indochina]] are notable for their diverse large [[vertebrate]] [[Fauna (animals)|faunas]]. [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] and [[New Caledonia]] dry forests are also highly distinctive (pronounced [[endemic (ecology)|endemism]] and a large number of [[relictual taxa]]) for a wide range of taxa and at higher [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic levels]]. Trees use underground water during the dry seasons.

==Biodiversity patterns and requirements==
[[File:Subtropical semi-evergreen seasonal forest in Northern Thailand.JPG|thumb|200px|Subtropical semi-evergreen seasonal forest in [[Doi Inthanon National Park]], [[Northern Thailand]], at the end of the dry season.]]
Species tend to have wider ranges than [[moist forest]] species, although in some regions many species do display highly restricted ranges; most dry forest species are restricted to tropical dry forests, particularly in plants; [[beta diversity]] and [[alpha diversity]] high but typically lower than adjacent moist forests.

Effective conservation of dry broadleaf forests requires the preservation of large and continuous areas of forest. Large natural areas are required to maintain larger [[predator]]s and other [[vertebrates]], and to buffer sensitive species from [[hunting]] pressure. The persistence of [[riparian forest]]s and water sources is critical for many dry forest species. Large swathes of [[intact forest]] are required to allow species to recover from occasional large events, like forest fires.

Dry forests are highly sensitive to excessive burning and [[deforestation]]; [[overgrazing]] and exotic species can also quickly alter natural communities; restoration is possible but challenging, particularly if degradation has been intense and persistent.

[[File:Bad Schussenried - Museumsdorf Kürnbach Holz Jauchefaß auf Leiterwagen.jpg|thumb|A hay wagon in Germany, of a type common throughout Europe (the ''[[:de:Leiterwagen|leiterwagen]]''). The sides are actually ladders attached to serve as containment of hay or grain, and may be removed, such as for hauling timber.]]
A '''wagon''' (also alternatively and archaically spelt ''waggon'' in British and Commonwealth English) is a heavy four-wheeled [[vehicle]] pulled by draught animals or on occasion by humans (see below), used for [[transport]]ing [[Good (economics)|goods]], commodities, agricultural materials, supplies and sometimes people.

Wagons are immediately distinguished from [[cart]]s (which have two wheels) and from lighter four-wheeled vehicles primarily for carrying people, such as [[carriage]]s. Wagons are usually pulled by animals such as [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s or [[ox]]en. They may be pulled by one animal or by several, often in pairs or teams. However, there are examples of human-propelled wagons, such as [[Corf (mining)|mining corfs]].

A wagon was formerly called a wain and one who builds or repairs wagons is a [[wainwright]]. More specifically, a '''wain''' is a type of horse- or oxen-drawn, load-carrying vehicle, used for agricultural purposes rather than transporting people. A wagon or cart, usually four-wheeled;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. Wain n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, a haywain, normally has four wheels, but the term has now acquired slightly poetical connotations, so is not always used with technical correctness. However, a two-wheeled "haywain" would be a hay cart, as opposed to a carriage. ''Wain'' is also an archaic term for a chariot. ''Wain'' can also be a verb, to carry or deliver, and has other meanings.

A person who [[Driving (horse)|drives]] wagons is called a "wagoner",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wagoner |title=Wagoner |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wagoner |title=Wagoner |publisher=The Free Dictionary |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "[[teamster]]", a "[[bullocky]]", a "[[Muleteer|muleskinner]]", or simply a "driver".

==Terminology and design==
The exact name and terminology used is often dependent on the design or shape of the wagon. If low and sideless may be called a dray, [[trolley (horse-drawn)|trolley]] or [[float (horse-drawn)|float]]. When traveling over long distances and periods, wagons may be covered with cloth to protect their contents from the elements; these are "[[covered wagon]]s". If it has a permanent top enclosing it, it may be called a "[[van]]".

[[Turning radius]] was a longstanding problem with wagons, dictated by the distance between the front wheels and the bed of the wagon—namely, the point where the rotating wheels collide with the side of the wagon when turning.&lt;ref name=ReesWaggon /&gt; Many earlier designs required a very large turning radius; however, shrinking the width of the bed means decreasing the size of the load.&lt;ref name=ReesWaggon /&gt; As this is a problem that [[carts]] (by virtue of their two-wheeled nature) do not face, this factor, combined with their lighter weight, meant that carts were long preferred over wagons for many uses.&lt;ref name=ReesWaggon /&gt;

The general solutions to this problem involved several modifications to the front-axle assembly. The front axle assembly of a wagon consists of an [[axle]], a pair of [[wheel]]s and a round  plate with a pin in its centre that sits halfway between the wheels. A round plate with a hole in its centre is located on the underside of the wagon. The plate on the wagon, in turn, sits on the plate on the axle between the wheels. This arrangement allows the axle and wheels to turn horizontally. The pin and hole arrangement could be reversed. The [[horse harness]] is attached to this assembly. To enable the wagon to turn in as little space as possible, the front pair of wheels are often made smaller than the rear pair to allow them to turn close under the vehicle sides,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Wagon|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to allow them to turn still further, the wagon body may be ''waisted''. This technique eventually led to further designs well-adapted to narrow areas; the front wheels of express wagons, trolleys and floats are small enough to turn under the vehicle's body.
&lt;!--the issue of weight: early wagons being very heavy, versus structural issues, versus carrying capacity, versus teaming requirements
Likewise, the 19th century saw the general decrease of the weight of farm wagons for ordinary use.--&gt;

[[File:Circus parade wagon.jpg|thumb|The "Lion Tableau" circus parade wagon, built in 1904.]]
Wagons have served numerous purposes, with numerous corresponding designs.&lt;ref name = ReesWaggon&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1817–1818 |title = WAGGON|volume=37 |encyclopedia= [[Rees's Cyclopædia]]|publisher= Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown|location= London|id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with motorized vehicles, some are designed to serve as many functions as possible, while others are highly specialized. This section will discuss a broad overview of the general classes of wagons; for details on specific types of wagons, see the individual links.

===Farm wagon===
Farm wagons are built for general multi-purpose usage in an agricultural or rural setting.  These include gathering hay, crops and wood, and delivering them to the farmstead or market.&lt;ref name=ReesWaggon /&gt;

A common form found throughout Europe is the ''leiterwagen'' ("ladder wagon"), a large wagon where the sides often consist of ladders strapped in place to hold in hay or grain, though these could be removed to serve other needs.&lt;ref name=ReesWaggon /&gt; A common type of farm wagon particular to North America is the [[buckboard]].

===Freight wagon===
Freight wagons are wagons used for the overland hauling of freight and bulk commodities.&lt;ref name="Santa Fe Trail"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Mark L.|title=Wagons on the Santa Fe Trail: 1822-1880|url=http://www.nps.gov/safe/historyculture/upload/Wagons-on-the-SFT_combined.pdf|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=5 February 2013|date=September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Canada, the [[Conestoga wagon]] was a predominant form of wagon used for hauling freight in the late 18th and 19th centuries, often used for hauling goods on the [[Great Wagon Road]] in the Appalachian Valley and across the Appalachian Mountains.

Even larger freight wagons existed. For instance, the "[[twenty-mule team]]" wagons, used for hauling borax from [[Death Valley]], could haul {{convert|36|ST|MT}} per pair.&lt;ref name="Twenty Mule NPS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty Mule Teams|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/historyculture/twenty-mule-teams.htm|work=Death Valley National Park|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wagons’ bodies were {{convert|16|ft|m}} long and {{convert|6|ft|m}} deep; the rear wheels were {{convert|7|ft|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Twenty Mule NPS" /&gt;

=== Delivery wagon ===
A '''delivery wagon''' is a wagon used to [[Delivery (commerce)|deliver]] merchandise such as milk, bread, or produce to houses or markets, as well as to [[commerce|commercial]] customers, often in urban settings. The concept of express wagons and of paneled delivery vans developed in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Stratton&gt;{{cite book|last=Stratton|first=Ezra M.|title=The World on Wheels|year=1878|publisher=the author|location=New York|pages=442–444|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924003597071}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, delivery wagons were often finely painted, lettered and varnished, so as to serve as advertisement for the particular business through the quality of the wagon.&lt;ref name=Hillick&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillick|first=M.C.|title=Practical Carriage and Wagon Painting|year=1898|publisher=Press of the Western Painter|location=Chicago|pages=2, 109–116|url=https://archive.org/details/practicalcarriag02hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Walter R.|title=Ice Delivery|year=1922|publisher=Nickerson &amp; Collins Co.|location=Chicago|pages=170–172|url=https://archive.org/details/icedeliveryacom00sandgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special forms of delivery wagon include an [[ice wagon]] and a [[milk wagon]].

===Nomadic wagons===
Some wagons are intended to serve as mobile residences or workshops. These include the [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|Vardo]], a traditional wagon of the 19th-century British [[Romani people]].

===Steam wagons===
The [[steam wagon]], a self-powered development of the horse-drawn wagon, was a surprisingly late innovation, entering service only in the late nineteenth century.

=== Irrigation ===

==Wagon train==
{{main|wagon train}}
In migration and military settings, wagons were often found in large groups called [[wagon train]]s.

In warfare, large groups of [[supply wagon]]s were used to support traveling armies with food and munitions, forming "baggage trains". During the [[American Civil War]], these wagon trains would often be accompanied by the wagons of private merchants, known as [[sutler]]s, who sold goods to soldiers, as well as the wagons of photographers and news reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bealton, VA.|last=O'Sullivan|first=Timothy|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/cwp2003000218/PP/|publisher=Library of Congress Prints &amp; Photographs|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Special purpose-built support wagons existed for [[Traveling forge|blacksmithing]], telegraphy and even observation ballooning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thaddeus Lowe with his Inflation Wagons|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/imageDetail.cfm?imageID=3370|publisher=Smithsonian Institution: National Air and Space Museum|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In migration settings, such as the [[emigrant trail]]s of the American West and the [[Great Trek]] of South Africa, wagons would travel together for support, navigation and protection. A group of wagons may be used to create an improvised fort called a [[laager]], made by circling them to form an enclosure. In these settings, a [[chuckwagon]] is a small wagon used for providing food and cooking, essentially a portable kitchen.

== Wagons in art ==

{{Commons category|Wagons in art}}
As a common, important element in history and life, wagons have been the subjects of artwork. Some examples are the paintings [[The Hay Wain]], [[The Haywain Triptych]] and on the [[Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar]].

==Motorized wagons==
During a transition to mechanized vehicles from animal powered, the term wagon was sometimes used such as with the [[Duryea Motor Wagon]]. In modern times the term [[Station wagon]] survives as a type of automobile.

The '''zinc–zinc oxide cycle''' or Zn–ZnO cycle is a two step [[thermochemical cycle]] based on [[zinc]] and [[zinc oxide]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarpaces.org/Tasks/Task2/SHP.HTM  Solar Hydrogen Production from a ZnO/Zn Thermo-chemical Cycle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724183416/http://www.solarpaces.org/Tasks/Task2/SHP.HTM |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[hydrogen production]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review06/pd_10_weimer.pdf Project PD10]&lt;/ref&gt; with a typical efficiency around 40%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.switt.ch/files/technologien/Solar%20Hydrogen%20Production_04-014.pdf Novel Method for solar hydrogen generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205122515/http://www.switt.ch/files/technologien/Solar%20Hydrogen%20Production_04-014.pdf |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process description==
The thermochemical two-step [[water splitting]] process uses [[redox]] systems:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060505180329/http://solar.web.psi.ch:80/data/research/zno/roca/ Solar thermal ZnO-decomposition]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Dissociation (chemistry)|Dissociation]]: [[Zinc oxide|ZnO]] → [[Zinc|Zn]] + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[Hydrolysis]]: [[Zinc|Zn]] + [[Water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] → [[Zinc oxide|ZnO]] + [[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

For the first [[endothermic]] step [[concentrating solar power]] is used in which zinc oxide is [[Thermal decomposition|thermally dissociated]] at {{convert|1900|°C|°F}} into zinc and oxygen. In the second non-solar [[exothermic]] step zinc reacts at {{convert|427|°C|°F}} with water and produces [[hydrogen]] and zinc oxide. The temperature level is realized by using a [[solar power tower]] and a set of [[heliostat]]s to collect the [[solar thermal energy]].
