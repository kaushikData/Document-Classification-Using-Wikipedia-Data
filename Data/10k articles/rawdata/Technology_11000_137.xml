      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9712">The '''AY-3-8500''' "Ball &amp; Paddle" [[integrated circuit]] was the first in a series of ICs from [[General Instrument]] designed for the consumer [[video game]] market. These chips were designed to output video to an [[RF modulator]], which would then display the game on a domestic [[television set]]. The AY-3-8500 contained six selectable games&amp;nbsp;— [[tennis]] (a.k.a. ''[[Pong]]''), [[association football|soccer]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], practice, and two [[rifle]] shooting games. The AY-3-8500 was the 625-line [[PAL]] version and the AY-3-8500-1 was the 525-line [[NTSC]] version. It was introduced in 1976, Coleco becoming the first customer having been introduced to the IC development by [[Ralph H. Baer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pong-story.com/coleco.htm The Coleco Telstar story&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum number of external components were needed to build a complete system.

[[Image:AY-3-8500.jpg|250px|thumb|AY-3-8500 chip]]
The AY-3-8500 was the first version. It played seven ''Pong'' variations. The video was in black-and-white, although it was possible to colorize the game by using an additional chip, such as the AY-3-8515.

==Games==
Six selectable games for one or two players were included:
{|  class="wikitable"
! Game !! Number of players
|-
| Tennis || 2
|-
| Soccer || 2
|-
| Squash || 2
|-
| Practice || 1
|-
| Rifle game 1 || 1
|-
| Rifle game 2 || 2
|}

In addition, a seventh undocumented game could be played when none of the previous six was selected: Handicap, a soccer variant where the player on the right has a third paddle. This game was implemented on very few systems.

==Usage==
The AY-3-8500 was designed to be powered by six 1.5&amp;nbsp;V cells (9&amp;nbsp;V). Its specified operation is at 6...7&amp;nbsp;V and a maximum of 12&amp;nbsp;V instead of the 5&amp;nbsp;V standard for logic. The nominal clock was 2.0&amp;nbsp;MHz, yielding a 500&amp;nbsp;ns pixel width. One way to generate such a clock is to divide a 14.31818&amp;nbsp;MHz 4×[[colorburst]] clock by 7, producing 2.04545&amp;nbsp;MHz. It featured independent video outputs for left player, right player, ball, and playground+counter, that were summed using resistors, allowing designers to use a different luminance for each one. It was housed in a standard 28-pin [[dual in-line package|DIP]].

==Applications==
Some of the [[dedicated console]]s employing the AY-3-8500 (there are at least two hundred different consoles using this chip&lt;ref name="listCons"&gt;http://www.pong-story.com/mypongs.htm List of first era consoles&lt;/ref&gt;):

* [[Sears Hockey Pong]]
* [[Coleco Telstar]] (Telstar, Classic, Deluxe, Ranger, Alpha, Colormatic, Regent, Sportsman)
* [[Magnavox Odyssey series]] (300, 2000 and 3000)
* [[Tv Scoreboard|Radio Shack TV ScoreBoard]]
* [[Unisonic Products Corporation#Foray into the video game console market|Unisonic Sportsman/Tournament]]
* [[Philips Tele-Spiel line|Philips Tele-Spiel ES2203 and ES2204]]
* Zanussi/Seleco [[Ping-O-Tronic#Play-o-tronic|Play-O-Tronic]]
* Videomaster (Strika, Strika 2,ColourScore 2, SuperScore)
* [[APF TV Fun]] (Model 401)
* Sportsmaster TVG 901
* Ameprod TVG-10 (the only console made in [[Poland]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elektroda.pl/rtvforum/topic1347024.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==AY-3-8550==
The AY-3-8550 was the next chip released by General Instruments. It featured horizontal player motion, and a composite video output. It was pin compatible with the AY-3-8500. It needed an additional AY-3-8515 chip to output video in color.

===Games===
Six selectable games for one or two players were included:
{|  class="wikitable"
! Game !! Number of players
|-
| Tennis || 2
|-
| Soccer || 2
|-
| Squash || 2
|-
| Practice || 1
|-
| Rifle game 1 || 1
|-
| Rifle game 2 || 2
|}

===Usage===
The AY-3-8550 used the No Connect pins from the AY-3-8500, so it was possible to put an AY-3-8550 on an AY-3-8500 (without horizontal movement), and vice versa.

==AY-3-8610==
[[Image:AY-3-8610.jpg|250px|thumb|AY-3-8610 chip from 1980]]
The AY-3-8610 was a major update from General Instruments. It played more games (10),&lt;ref name=Gimini&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pong-story.com/GIMINI1978.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316160455/http://www.pong-story.com/GIMINI1978.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-16 }} Gimini - TV Game Circuits&lt;/ref&gt; like [[basketball]] or [[ice hockey|hockey]], with higher-quality graphics. It was nicknamed "Superstar" by GI. It was in black and white, although it was possible to add color by using an additional AY-3-8615 chip.

Prior to producing the 8610, GI created the AY-3-8600. The pin configuration was the same as the 8610, but it was missing the two rifle/target games, bringing the total number of games down to 8.

===Games===

|}

===Usage===
The AY-3-8610 featured a completely different pinout. It, too, required an external crystal oscillator. It still had separate video output pins, and removed the dedicated sync pin.

* An equivalent to the AY-3-8500 is the [[TMS1965NLA]] manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]].
* The Soviet K145IK17 has a built-in counter, making it possible to use a momentary pushbutton instead of a multi-position switch to select games. The handicap game is not hidden, it can be chosen among others using this button. Since a pushbutton occupies only one pin, this IC has less pins.
* A competitor was the [[National Semiconductor]] MM57105.

'''Automatic Independent Surveillance - Privacy''' ('''AIS-P''') is a [[data packet]] protocol for the TailLight system of [[aircraft]] [[Traffic Collision Avoidance System]] (TCAS), wherein a single Mode S 64 [[microsecond]] message is transmitted by an aircraft ATCRBS or Mode S [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponder]], and received by aircraft and [[Air Traffic Control]] on the ground.  This is an augmentation to aircraft transponders,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collisionavoidance.org/aispkit.jpg &lt;/ref&gt; which report aircraft position and velocity in such a way as to minimize interference with any other avionics system, maximize the possible number of participating aircraft, while not relying on any equipment on the ground, and protecting aircraft from potential attack.  AIS-P and [[Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast|ADS-B]] are competing protocols for aircraft based surveillance of traffic, a replacement technology for Mode S radar and TCAS. 

==AIS-P as an alternative to ADS-B==
TailLight implemented as a free addition inside General Aviation ATCRBS transponders, such as the AT-155, utilizes the AIS-P protocol to achieve all intended ADS-B advertised [[collision avoidance]] benefits in the [[airport terminal]] and en route [[airspace]]. It does not interfere with any other [[avionics| avionic systems]], produces a system capacity  of up to 335,000 aircraft within line-of-sight of each other, and provides interoperability with the other collision avoidance systems{{which|date=September 2014}}, without exposing the aircraft to potential attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airsport-corp.com/adsb2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209222607/http://www.airsport-corp.com/adsb2.htm |archivedate=2007-02-09 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The AIS-P protocol is an alternative to the ADS-B and Mode S based TCAS protocols, and solves the problems of [[frequency]] congestion, by eliminating a requirement for multiple packet messages, or new longer packet definitions for ADS-B not established by international treaty, and by eliminating the 24 bit overhead for named identity in each packet of the message (required to tie multiple packets together into a message).  One packet encodes [[latitude]] and [[longitude]],  [[altitude]], [[Direction (geometry)|direction]], and [[speed]] (full position and [[velocity]]), handles error detection and recovery, along with channel use arbitration, in the AIS-P protocol.  This reduces verbose overhead unnecessary for collision avoidance purposes.

The AIS-P protocol is not meant for purposes of billing and targeting.  Additionally, one of the requirements satisfied by the AIS-P protocol is that a missile with an ADS-B type target homer aimed at the unnamed aircraft alone in the sky would miss.

'''Billon''' is a [[Financial technology|fintech]] company operating in [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Poland]] which developed a technology to store and transfer regulated [[Currency|currencies]] and other data using a proprietary [[blockchain]].

== Overview ==
Billon designed a light-weight permissioned blockchain, with ordinary consumer electronic devices such as [[desktop computer]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[smartphone]]s, and others, acting as nodes after installing a dedicated [[Application software|application]]. In comparison with other blockchains, Billon's technology does not use [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]]., but regulated currencies, such as [[Polish złoty|Polish zloty]] and [[Pound sterling|British pound]], in compliance with [[Digital currency|e-money]] regulations.

Billon's technology can be used for incentives, loyalty programs, market research, [[e-commerce]], or content monetisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://billongroup.com/|title=Billon {{!}} Home page|website=billongroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://billon.live/en/|title=Billon {{!}} Home page|website=billon.live|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billon claims to reach the speed of transactions orders of magnitude faster than other blockchains. According to the company, throughput tests proved the number of 130 million transactions per day, i.e. couple of thousands per second. The resulting speed of transactions is comparable with [[Paypass#PayPass|contactless payment cards]], achieving much lower fraud levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.billongroup.com/23784-billon-sets-industry-standard-benchmark-for-blockchain-scalability|title=Billon sets industry-standard benchmark for blockchain scalability - Billon|website=press.billongroup.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
There is no mining process in Billon architecture. Instead, genesis blocks in Billon's blockchain are created by authorised issuers, primarily licensed [[bank]]s that exchange paper or electronic money into their digital equivalents. Money has a form of a file with Billon specified crypto-protocol standard. This allows interoperability between multiple blockchains storing money issued by different banks. Once a blockchain is created and transferred by the bank to the first user, further circulation is done entirely on [[peer-to-peer]] basis without any further involvement from the issuing bank.

Each entry has a serial number embedded, together with denomination, currency, identifier of the issuing bank as well as layer of digital watermarks and digital signatures. Signatures are both in standard [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] format and on [[Elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curves]] created by bank's [[Hardware security module|HSM]].

In order to access the blockchain, users need a dedicated application that contains public keys of the issuers. The application, just like [[bitcoin]] [[cryptocurrency wallet]], is capable of parsing Billon's digital blockchain format and verifying signatures on incoming and outgoing money. Both the sending and receiving party have to register their public keys at the issuing bank. This is done automatically during registration process.

Merchant or user wishing to convert money from Billon's blockchain to electronic or paper money can do so via bank transfer or a cardless withdrawal at the [[automated teller machine]] (ATM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.billon.info%2Fpartnerzy%2Fekosystem%2F|title=Ecosystem participants.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=an independent source is needed|date=September 2017}}

A '''biosand filter''' (BSF) is a point-of-use water treatment system adapted from traditional [[slow sand filter]]s. Biosand filters remove pathogens and suspended solids from water using biological and physical processes that take place in a sand column covered with a [[biofilm]]. BSFs have been shown to remove heavy metals, turbidity, bacteria, viruses and protozoa.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;Elliott, M., Stauber, C., Koksal, F., DiGiano, F., and M. Sobsey (2008). Reduction of E. coli, echovirus type 12 and bacteriophages in an intermittently operated 2 household-scale slow sand filter.Water Research, Volume 42, Issues 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2008|url=http://itacanet.org/eng/water/Section%206%20Water%20treatment/Biosand_filter_CAWST.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSFs also reduce discoloration, odor and unpleasant taste. Studies have shown a correlation between use of BSFs and a decrease in the occurrence of [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and lack of recurring costs, biosand filters are often considered [[appropriate technology]] in developing countries. It is estimated that over 200,000 BSFs are in use worldwide.&lt;ref name="Elliot" /&gt;

==History==

The household biosand filter was proposed by Dr. David Manz in the late 1980s at the [[University of Calgary]], Canada.&lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST History|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/about-us/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was developed from the [[slow sand filter]], a technology that has been used for drinking water purification since the 1800s.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; Initial lab and field tests were conducted in 1991; the system was patented in 1993 &lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"/&gt; and was implemented in the field in [[Nicaragua]]. The Canadian non-profit company [[Center for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology]] ([[CAWST]]) was co-founded in 2001 by David Manz and [[Camille Dow Baker]] to promote education and training in water purification and sanitation including using this technology, and to continue developing it.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; A privately owned company, Hydraid Biosand Water Filter  produces and distributes plans for filters.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydraid Biosand Technology|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosand filter components==

[[File:Ohorizons Concrete BioSand Filter.png|thumb|Basic Diagram of a Concrete BioSand Filter]]

Biosand filters are typically constructed from concrete or plastic.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; At the top of the filter, a tightly fitted lid prevents contamination and unwanted pests from entering the filter. Below this, the diffuser plate prevents disturbance of the [[biofilm]] when water is poured into the filter. Water then travels through the sand column, which removes pathogens and suspended solids. Below the sand column, a layer of gravel prevents sand from entering the drainage layer and clogging the outlet tube. Below the separating layer is the drainage layer consisting of coarser gravel that prevents clogging near the base of the outlet tube.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt;

== Filtration process ==
Pathogens and suspended solids are removed by biological and physical processes that take place in the biolayer and the sand layer. These processes include:
*'''Mechanical trapping:''' Suspended solids and pathogens are trapped in the spaces between the sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Predation:''' Pathogens are consumed by microorganisms in the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Adsorption:''' Pathogens are absorbed into each other and to suspended solids in the water and sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Natural death:''' Pathogens finish their life cycles or die because there is not enough food or oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===During the run===
The high water level (hydraulic head) in the inlet reservoir zone pushes the water through the diffuser and filter, then decreases as water flows evenly through the sand. The flow rate slows because there is less pressure to force the water through the filter. The inlet water contains dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and contaminants. It provides the oxygen required by the microorganisms in the biofilm. Large suspended particles and pathogens are trapped in the top of the sand and partially plug the pore spaces between the sand grains. This causes the flow rate to decrease.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Pause period (idle time)===

Idle time typically comprises greater than 80% of the daily cycle; during this time, microbial attenuation processes are likely to be significant. Most removal occurs where water is in contact with the biofilm. The processes that occur in the biofilm have not been identified.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; When the standing water layer reaches the level of the outlet tube, the flow stops.  Ideally, this should be high enough to keep the biofilm in the sand layer wet and allow oxygen to diffuse through the standing water to the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; The pause period allows microorganisms in the biolayer to consume the pathogens and nutrients in the water. The rate of flow through the filter is restored as they are consumed. If the pause period is too long, the biolayer will consume all of the pathogens and nutrients and will die, reducing the efficiency of the filter when it is used again. The pause period should be between 1 and 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Pathogens in the non-biological zone die from a lack of nutrients and oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

==Maintenance==
Over time, particles accumulate between the filter's sand grains. As more water is poured, a biofilm forms along the top of the diffuser plate. Both of these occurrences cause a decrease in flow rate (clogging and [[bioclogging]]). Although slower flow rates generally improve water filtration due to idle time [APS1], it may become too slow for the users’ convenience. If flow rates fall below 0.1 litres/minute, it is recommended by CAWST to perform maintenance.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; The "swirl and dump", or wet harrowing cleaning technique, is used to restore flow rate. About {{Convert|1|USgal|l}} is poured into the filter before cleaning (assuming the filter is empty). The upper layer of sand is then swirled in a circular motion. Dirty water from the swirling is dumped out and the sand is smoothed out at the top. This process is repeated until flow rate is restored.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Cleaning the diffuser plate, outlet tube, lid, and outside surfaces of the filters regularly is also recommended.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Long-term sustainability and efficacy of biosand filters depends on education and support from knowledgeable support personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sisson|first=Andrew J.|author2=Wampler, PJ |author3=Rediske RR |author4= Molla AR |title=An assessment of long-term biosand filter use and sustainability in the Artibonite Valley near Deschapelles, Haiti|journal=Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|date=January 2013|volume=3|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.2166/washdev.2013.092|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/washdev/003/washdev0030051.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit in Haiti implements an education and follow-up program post-installation of the biosand filter. The program includes visits to the beneficiary homes after one, three and twelve months and another at 5 years from installation date. During each visit, beneficiaries receive repeated instruction about safe water practices and how to take care of the filter. Based on data collected since 2010, between 94% and 99% of filters are still being used regularly 12 months after installation. &lt;ref&gt;cleanwaterforhaiti.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal of contaminants==

===Turbidity===
Results for turbidity reductions vary depending on the turbidity of the influent water. Turbid water contains sand, silt and clay.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt;  Feed turbidity in one study ranged from 1.86 to 3.9 NTU.  In a study water was obtained from sample taps of water treatment plants from three local reservoirs. It poured through a slow sand filter and results showed that turbidity decreased to a mean of 1.45 NTU.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; In another study using surface water a 93% reduction in turbidity was observed.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; As the biofilm above the sand ripens, turbidity removal increases.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Although biosand filters remove much turbidity, slow sand filters, which have a slower filtration rate, remove more.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Heavy metals===
There is limited research on the removal of heavy metals by biosand filters.  In a study conducted in South Africa, the filter removed about 64% of iron and 5% of magnesium.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"&gt;Mwabi, J.K., F.E. Adeyemo and T.O. Mamba. "Household Water Treatment Systems: A Solution to the Production of Safe Drinking." SAO/NASA ADS: ADS Home Page. Web. 22 Dec. 2011. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PCE....36.1120M&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
In laboratory studies, the biosand filter has been found to remove about 98-99% of bacteria.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; In removal of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' it was found that the biosand filter may increase due to biofilm formation over about two months. The removal after this time ranged from 97-99.99% depending on the daily water volume and percent primary effluent added. The addition of primary effluent or waste water facilitates growth of the biofilm which aids bacterial die-off.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Research shows that biosand filters in use in the field remove fewer bacteria than ones in a controlled environment.  In research conducted in 55 households of [[Bonao]], Dominican Republic, the average E. coli reduction was about 93 percent.&lt;ref name="Stauber"/&gt;

===Viruses===
Lab tests have shown that while the filters reduce significant quantities of  E. coli, they remove significantly fewer viruses because viruses are smaller.  In a study using bacteriophages, virus removal ranged between 85% and 95% after 45 days of usage.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; A recent study has suggested that virus removal increases significantly over time, reaching 99.99% after approximately 150 days.&lt;ref name="Virus Removal"&gt;Bradley, I., Straub, A., Maraccini, P., Markazi, Nguyen, T., (2011).  Iron Oxide Amended Biosand Filters for Virus Removal.  Water Research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protozoa===
In one lab test the biosand filter removed more than 99.9% of [[protozoa]].  In tests for one type of protozoa, ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', the filter removed 100% over 29 days of use. It removed 99.98% of the oocysts of another protozoa, ''Cryptosporidium sp.'', possibly due to their smaller size.  This removal was comparable with that of the slow sand filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/point-use-water-treatment/bio-sand-filtrat|title=Biosand Filter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health benefits ==

Studies in the Dominican Republic and Cambodia conducted by the [[University of North Carolina]] and the University of Nevada show that BSF use the reduced occurrence of diarrheal diseases by 47% in all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stauber|first=Christine|author2=Gloria M. Ortiz |author3=Dana P. Loomis |author4=Mark D. Sobsey |title=A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Concrete Biosand Filter and Its Impact on Diarrheal Disease in Bonai, Dominican Republic|journal=The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2009|volume=80|issue=2|pages=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by CAWST in Haiti, 95% of 187 households believed their water quality had improved since using biosand filters to clean it. 80% of users stated that their families’ health had improved since implementation. Such health perceptions on the use of biosand filter has shown to be more positive in long-term users.&lt;ref name="Stauber"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobsey|first=Mark|author2=Christine Stauber |author3=Lisa Casanova |author4=Joseph Brown |author5=Mark Elliott |title=Point of Use Household Drinking Water Filtration: A Practical, Effective Solution for Providing Sustained Access to Safe Drinking Water in the Developing World|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|year=2008|doi=10.1021/es8026133 |volume=43 |pages=970–971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of biosand filters==

===Concrete===

[[Concrete]] filters, of concrete, are the most widespread type of biosand filter.  Concrete is generally preferable to other materials because of the low cost, wide availability and the ability to be constructed on-site. The plans for the concrete filter are distributed openly by CAWST. Several versions have been developed. The CAWST Version 9 biosand filter is constructed with a higher maximum loading rate. Although the filtered water passes EPA water quality standards, it is not optimal.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2010|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/pubs/file/43-pi-for-bsf-manual-complete-english}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research establishes that contact time between the water and the granular material is the leading determinant in purifying water. The CAWST Version 10 biosand filter takes this into account; the volume of the water reservoir is equal to the pore space volume of the sand layer. The maximum loading rate was decreased by 33% to ensure stagnant water is in constant contact with granular material.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"/&gt;

Concrete BioSand filters are typically manufactured using steel molds. The plans for a steel mold are openly distributed by CAWST.

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit organization based in Camp Marie, Haiti manufactures the biosand filters using an adaptation of the steel mold.  &lt;ref&gt;http://cleanwaterforhaiti.org/programs/how-does-the-filter-work/&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-profit organization OHorizons has designed a Wood Mold, based on CAWST’s Version 10 filter, which can function as low-cost alternative. The plans for a Wood Mold are openly available on the OHorizons website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohorizons.org/resources/ OHorizons Wood Mold Construction Manual and Appendix]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic===

Plastic filters are constructed from plastic barrels, usually formed offsite. Hydraid biosand filters are constructed from medical grade plastic with [[ultraviolet]] resistance.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; TivaWater is the newest version of the plastic biosand filter and has several important improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tivawater.com tivawater.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stainless steel===

A stainless steel biosand filter developed by engineers at [[S M Sehgal Foundation]], an NGO based in Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon), India, has been found to perform better than its concrete counterparts and with a wider opportunity for application and adoption in different geographical conditions. The high cost of plastic prevents its use in rural India. The stainless steel filter, called JalKalp, offers increased filtration rate and better portability (than concrete models) and better production quality control. Concrete filters are prone to breakage and can be difficult to transport due to weight (65&amp;nbsp;kg), make it unsuitable especially in remote rural or hilly locations. Common quality issues are variations in construction material and manufacturing flaws. Further, the efflorescence due to salts in water reduces the life of the concrete filter. The newly developed lightweight (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg) stainless steel biosand filter has an edge over concrete filters, overcoming each of those shortcomings and providing better quality control. Besides improving its appearance, stainless steel adds to the strength, reliability, durability, and portability of the filter. Water quality tests demonstrate JalKalp's effectiveness against E coli, total coliforms, turbidity, and iron contamination. This filter integrates the germicidal properties of copper with the conventional filtration. Introduction of copper foil in the drainage zone of JalKalp filter has increased the removal of total coliform and E coli to 100% from contaminated water. S M Sehgal Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the model, which required no electricity, across India through partnerships with like-minded organizations to benefit as many rural families as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Lalit Mohan Sharma and Saurabh Sood, "Reinventing the Biosand Filter: An Easy Solution for Safe Drinking Water," ''IOSR Journals'', International Organization of Scientific Research, Vol 10. Issue 1, pp43-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Reinventing-the-biosand-filter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/jalkalp-water-sands-impurities /|title=JalKalp: Water sands impurities|last=Bhaduri|first=Amita|publisher= “India Water Portal” 13, November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are challenges to creating biosand water filters in developing countries.  Many lack the professional capability of constructing the metal forms to pour the concrete into. Finding proper mesh sizes to sift the sand layers may also be absent.  In Nicaragua you may find metal workers capable of welding rebar for home construction, however, you will not find sheet metal bending equipment to create the metal molds.  Sand is not sold in hardware stores like in the United States. It is most likely purchased by the pickup load from streambeds or pits and the only mesh available is 1/4 inch which is too large. When traveling to a third world country it might be best to take with you the proper mesh screens.

Another problem facing the use of the filters is adoption. Many projects may provide assistance in building the water filters and some may even distribute them but getting the host country nationals to use the filters requires much more dedication.  People need to be connected to water filter owners to insist they use the devices and get them into the habit of using them.  Otherwise several of the filters are abandoned and left unattended in the roads. Simply handing the filters out is insufficient for adoption.

The first BRT system was the [[Rede Integrada de Transporte]] ('Integrated Transportation Network') in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, which entered service in 1974.

{{As of|2018|03}}, a total of 166 cities in six continents have implemented BRT systems, accounting for {{Convert|4906|km|abbr=on}} of BRT lanes &lt;ref name="BRTdata" /&gt; and about 32.2 million passengers every day, of which about 19.6 million passengers ride daily in [[Latin America]], which has the most cities with BRT systems, with 54, led by Brazil with 21 cities.&lt;ref name="BRTdata"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brtdata.org/|title=Global BRT Data&amp;nbsp;— Worldwide and Key indicators per region|author= [[EMBARQ - The WRI Center for Sustainable Transport]]|publisher=BRTdata.org |date=November 2016|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin American countries with the most daily ridership are Brazil (10.7M), Colombia (3.06M), and Mexico (2.5M). In the other regions, China (4.3M) and Iran (2.1M) also stand out.&lt;ref name="BRTdata" /&gt; Currently, [[TransJakarta]] is considered as the largest BRT network in the world with approximately {{convert|230.9|km}} of corridors connecting the [[Jakarta|Indonesian capital city]].&lt;ref name="TJ-Koridor"&gt;{{cite web | title = Koridor | work = Transjakarta | url = http://transjakarta.co.id/produk-dan-layanan/infrastruktur/koridor/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Bus rapid transit takes its name from rail [[rapid transit]], which describes a high-capacity urban public-transit system with its own [[right-of-way (transportation)|right of way]], multiple-car vehicles at short [[headway]]s, and longer stop spacing than traditional streetcars and buses. BRT uses buses on a wide variety of rights-of-way, including mixed traffic, dedicated lanes on surface streets, and busways separated from traffic.

The expression "BRT" is mainly used in the Americas and China; in India, it is called "BRTS" (BRT System); in Europe and Indonesia, it is often called a "busway"; in Australia it is often called a "T-Way" (short for Transit Way); while in the [[British Isles]], it may be called a "quality bus".

Critics have charged that the term "bus rapid transit" has sometimes been misapplied to systems that lack most or all the essential features which differentiate it from conventional bus services. The term "[[bus rapid transit creep]]" has been used to describe severely degraded levels of bus service which fall far short of the [[BRT Standard]] promoted by the [[Institute for Transportation and Development Policy]] and other organizations.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Growth of BRT Systems World 1970 to 2013.png|thumb|right|Growth of BRT Systems around the world, 1970 to 2013]] --&gt;
The first use of a protected busway was the [[East Side Trolley Tunnel]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]].  It was converted from trolley to bus use in 1948. However, the first BRT system in the world was the [[OC Transpo]] system in Ottawa, Canada. Introduced in 1973, the first element of its BRT system was dedicated bus lanes through the city centre, with platformed stops. The introduction of the first exclusive separate busways (termed 'Transitway') occurred in 1983. By 1996, all of the originally envisioned 31&amp;nbsp;km Transitway system was in operation; further expansions were opened in 2009, 2011, and 2014.  As of 2017, the central part of the Transitway is being converted to a [[Light Rail Transit]], due to the downtown section being operated beyond its designed capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octranspo.com/about-octranspo/history_looking_back}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| quote          = Pittsburgh’s leadership on the urban sustainability front is not a recent phenomenon – in fact, it was the first city in the United States to implement elements of bus rapid transit, and it paved the way for more robust U.S. BRT systems. In 1977, only three years after Curitiba, Brazil implemented the world’s first BRT system, Pittsburgh opened the South Busway, 4.3 miles of exclusive bus lanes, running through previously underserved areas of the city, from the western suburbs to the downtown. The city was concerned about worsening traffic congestion, and, lacking the funds to rehabilitate the city's streetcar lines, took inspiration from Curitiba and created the South Busway. Funding for the system came from the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]], the state of Pennsylvania and Allegheny County. The Port Authority of Allegheny County, a county-owned, state-funded agency, operates the system. The success of the South Busway helped the city leverage funding for the expansion of the network, and in 1983, the Martin Luther King, Jr. East Busway opened. The East Busway began as a 6.8-mile network, with an additional 2.3 miles added in 2003, connecting the eastern suburbs with downtown. Fifteen bus routes run along its corridor. Its current weekday ridership is 25,600, with annual ridership close to 7 million. The East Busway built on the success of its predecessor and offered fundamental BRT features including a dedicated busway, service as frequent as every two minutes during peak period, signal prioritization, and direct service operations (more on that soon). However, there is no off-board fare collection. Instead, passengers pay upon entrance for in-bound trips and upon exit for outbound trips, which helps reduce delays in service because of fare collection.

Its success led to the [[Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway]] in 1983, a fuller BRT deployment including a dedicated busway of {{convert|9.1|mile}}, [[traffic signal preemption]], and peak service headway as low as two minutes. After the opening of the [[West Busway]], {{convert|5.1|mile}} in length in 1990, Pittsburgh’s Busway system is today over 18.5 miles long.

In 1995, [[Quito]], Ecuador, opened [[Quito trolleybus system|trolleybus BRT]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The [[TransMilenio]] in [[Bogotá, Colombia]], opening in 2000, was the first BRT system to combine the best elements of Curitiba's BRT with other BRT advances, and achieved the highest capacity and highest speed BRT system in the world. The success of TransMilenio spurred other cities to develop high quality BRT systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In January 2004 the first BRT in Asia, [[TransJakarta]], opened in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia. {{Asof|2015}}, at {{convert|210|km}}, it is the longest BRT system in the world.&lt;ref name="JP-1"&gt;{{cite news | title = Train service has moved forward, can Transjakarta follow? | author = Bambang Nurbianto | date = 12 September 2015 | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/09/12/train-service-has-moved-forward-can-transjakarta-follow.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features ==
{{Main|BRT Standard}}
BRT systems normally include most of the following features:

===  Dedicated lanes and alignment ===
[[File:Transjakarta Pemuda Pramuka 2.jpg|thumb|[[TransJakarta]] buses use separate lanes to avoid [[traffic congestion|congested roads]].]]
[[File:Xiamen BRT 18m.jpg|right|thumb|Elevated BRT system in [[Xiamen]]]]
[[File:Flagstaff busway.jpg|thumb|Dedicated "bus street" through [[Northern Arizona University]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], U.S., used by university and city buses only]]
Bus-only lanes make for faster travel and ensure that buses are not delayed by mixed [[traffic congestion]]. A median alignment bus-only keeps buses away from busy curb-side side conflicts, where cars and trucks are parking, standing and turning. Separate rights of way may be used such as the completely elevated [[Xiamen BRT]]. [[Transit mall]]s or 'bus streets' may also be created in city centers.

=== Off-board fare collection ===
Fare prepayment at the station, instead of on board the bus, eliminates the delay caused by passengers paying on board.

=== Intersection treatment ===
Prohibiting turns for traffic across the bus lane significantly reduces delays to the buses. [[Bus priority]] will often be provided at signalized intersections to reduce delays by extending the green phase or reducing the red phase in the required direction compared to the normal sequence. Prohibiting turns may be the most important measure for moving buses through intersections.

=== Platform-level boarding ===
[[File:Cultural Centre busway station 07.2013.jpg|thumb|[[Cultural Centre busway station]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]]]
Station platforms should be level with the bus floor for quick and easy boarding, making it fully accessible for wheelchairs, disabled passengers and baby strollers, with minimal delays.

High-level platforms for high-floored buses makes it difficult to have stops outside dedicated platforms, or to have conventional buses stop at high-level platforms, so these BRT stops are distinct from street-level bus stops. Similar to rail vehicles, there is a risk of a [[platform gap|dangerous gap between bus and platform]], and is even greater due to the nature of bus operations. [[Kassel curb]]s or other methods may be used to ease quick and safe alignment of the BRT vehicle with a platform.

A popular compromise is [[low-floor bus]]es with a low step at the door, which can allow easy boarding at low-platform stops compatible with other buses. This intermediate design may be used with some low- or medium-capacity BRT systems.

The MIO system in Cali pioneered in 2009 the use of dual buses, with doors on the left side of the bus that are located at the height of high-level platforms, and doors on the right side that are located at curb height. This buses can use the main line with its exclusive lanes and high level platforms, located on the center of the street and thus, boarding and leaving passengers on the left side. These buses can exit the main line and use normal lanes that share with other vehicles and stop at regular stations located on sidewalks, located to the right side of the street. For the system to work, users have the right to receive "credit" on the electronic cards: in this manner, passengers that have no money left on the cards can take the bus on sidewalk stops where there is no possibility to recharge these cards. This means that the balance in the card can be negative, up to two ticket fares, so passengers can take the bus in the street and recharge the card once they reach a main line station. As the card itself costs more than the maximum negative balance, the passenger has no incentive to default on his negative credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Terminos y condiciones tarjeta MIO|url = http://mio.com.co/index.php/en/noticias/cultura-mio/681-terminos-y-condiciones-tarjeta-mio|website = mio.com.co|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmilenio in Bogotá followed suit in 2014 also creating routes that can use main line stations and regular sidewalk stations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inicia Operación la Carrera 7 con Buses Duales {{!}} Transmilenio|url = http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/es/articulos/inicia-operacion-la-carrera-7-con-buses-duales|website = www.transmilenio.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-08-20|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018092300/http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/es/articulos/inicia-operacion-la-carrera-7-con-buses-duales|archivedate = 18 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead of giving credit to passengers to allow boarding the bus on sidewalks, published a map readable in smart phones giving the location of a dense&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tullave plus|url = http://www.tullaveplus.com/recarga|website = www.tullaveplus.com|accessdate = 2015-08-20|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150810081725/http://www.tullaveplus.com/recarga|archivedate = 10 August 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; network of 4,000 recharging points, located in internet cafes and other business, that use a swipe-card terminal for recharging. This system has the additional benefit of diminishing queues on main line stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tarjetas de TransMilenio ya se pueden recargar en todos los puntos SITP|url = http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/tarjetas-de-transmilenio-ya-se-pueden-recargar-todos-lo-articulo-508953|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2018}}&lt;!-- The article doesn't speak about diminishing queues on main line stations --&gt;

== Additional features ==

=== High capacity vehicles ===
[[File:Metrobús_at_Paseo_de_la_Reforma.jpg|thumb|Double decker bus at Mexico City with capacity for 130 passengers.]]
[[File:Transmilenio vehicle interior.jpg|thumb|TransMilenio vehicles carry up to 270 people.]]
High-capacity vehicles such as [[Articulated bus|articulated]] or even [[bi-articulated bus]]es may be used, typically with multiple doors for fast entry and exit. [[Double-decker bus]]es{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} or [[guided bus]]es may also be used. Advanced [[Powertrain Control Module|powertrain control]] may be used for a smoother ride.

=== Quality stations ===
[[File:TransMilenio Calle 63.jpg|thumb|Ticket barriers at the entrance to a [[TransMilenio]] station in [[Bogotá]]]]
BRT systems typically feature significant investment in enclosed stations which may incorporate attractive sliding glass doors, staffed ticket booths, information booths, and other more standard features listed above. They will often include level boarding, using either [[low-floor bus]]es or higher boarding platforms level, and multiple doors to speed passenger boardings and enhance accessibility to disabled passengers. Fare validation upon entry to the station in a similar manner to that used on entry to a subway system is also common, particularly at busy stations.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} An example of high-quality stations include those used on [[TransMilenio]] in Bogotá since December 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/es/articulos/historia|title=Historia|publisher=Transmilenio|accessdate=20 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919011327/http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/es/articulos/historia|archivedate=19 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2018}}&lt;!-- The article doesn't give any details about the stations --&gt; the [[Masivo Integrado de Occidente|MIO]] in [[Cali]] since November, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historico.elpais.com.co/paisonline/calionline/notas/Noviembre152008/calimio.html|title=Cali inauguró el MÍO|publisher=El País|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metrolinea]] in [[Bucaramanga]] since December, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardia.com/historico/48967|title=Arrancó inauguración de Metrolínea|publisher=Vanguardia Liberal|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Megabús]] in [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] since May, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/articuloimpreso138860-pereira-se-monta-al-megabus|title=Pereira se monta al Megabús|publisher=El Espectador|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design is also used in [[Johannesburg]]'s [[Rea Vaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reavaya.org.za/|title=Home|work=reavaya.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "station" is more flexibly applied in North America and ranges from enclosed waiting areas ([[Ottawa]] and [[Cleveland]]) to large open-sided shelters ([[Los Angeles]] and [[San Bernardino]]).

=== Prominent brand or identity ===
A unique and distinctive identity can contribute to BRT's attractiveness as an alternative to driving cars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbrti.org/docs/pdf/Characteristics_BRT_Decision-Making.pdf Characteristics of BRT for decision making.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415111548/http://www.nbrti.org/docs/pdf/Characteristics_BRT_Decision-Making.pdf |date=15 April 2016 }} page ES-8. Federal Transit Administration (August 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; (such as Viva, Max, TransMilenio, Metropolitano, Metronit, Select) marking stops and stations as well as the buses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.info/mta/planning/sbs/faqs.htm What is Select Bus Service?] NYC Metropolitan Transit Authority. Retrieved 12 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Large cities usually have big bus networks. A map showing all bus lines might be incomprehensible, and cause people to wait for low-frequency buses that may not even be running at the time they are needed. By identifying the main bus lines having high-frequency service, with a special brand and separate maps, it is easier to understand the entire network.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Public transit apps are more convenient than a static map, featuring services like trip planning, live arrival and departure times, up-to-date line schedules, local station maps, service alerts, and advisories that may affect one's current trip. [[Transit (app)|Transit]] and [[Moovit]] are examples of apps that are available in many cities around the world. Some operators of bus rapid transit systems have developed their own apps, like Transmilenio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conozca la 'app' que le brinda información sobre Sitp y TransMilenio (in Spanish)|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-15071135|publisher=El Tiempo|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These apps even include all the schedules and live arrival times and stations for buses that feed the BRT, like the SITP (Sistema Integrado de Transporte Público or Public Transit Integrated System) in Bogotá{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

=== In tunnels or subterranean structures ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
[[File:Seattle Metro Bus Tunnel Pioneer Square Station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel]] in [[Seattle]], Washington]]
A special issue arises in the use of buses in [[rapid transit|metro transit]] structures. Since the areas where the demand for an exclusive bus right-of-way are apt to be in dense downtown areas where an above-ground structure may be unacceptable on historic, logistic, or environmental grounds, use of BRT in tunnels may not be avoidable.

Since buses are usually powered by [[internal combustion engine]]s, bus metros raise ventilation issues similar to those of motor vehicle tunnels. Powerful fans typically exchange air through [[ventilation shaft]]s to the surface; these are usually as remote as possible from occupied areas, to minimize the effects of noise and concentrated pollution.

A straightforward way to reduce air quality problems is to use internal combustion engines with lower emissions. The 2008 Euro V [[European emission standards]] set a limit on [[carbon monoxide]] from heavy-duty [[diesel engine]]s of 1.5 g/kWh, one third of the 1992 Euro I standard. As a result, less forced ventilation will be required in tunnels to achieve the same air quality.

A different alternative is to use electric propulsion, [[Seattle]]'s [[Metro Bus Tunnel (Seattle)|Metro Bus Tunnel]], and [[Boston]]'s [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] Phase II are using this method in their BRTs. In Seattle, [[Dual-mode bus|dual-mode]] (electric/diesel electric) buses manufactured by Breda were used until 2004, with the center axle driven by [[electric motor]]s obtaining power from [[Overhead lines|trolley wires]] through [[trolley pole]]s in the subway, and with the rear axle driven by a conventional diesel [[powertrain]] on freeways and streets. Boston is using a similar approach, after initially using trolleybuses pending delivery of the dual-mode vehicles in 2005. In 2004, Seattle replaced its "Transit Tunnel" fleet with diesel-electric hybrid buses, which operate similarly to [[hybrid car]]s outside the tunnel and in a low-noise, low-emissions "hush mode" (in which the diesel engine operates but does not exceed [[idle speed]]) when underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/vehicles/bustech.html|title=Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and Changing Bus Technology|author=Metro Online|date=14 December 2007|publisher=King County Metro|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/boston/silver.html|title=MBTA Silver Line|author=Duncan Allen|year=2005|publisher=www.nycsubway.org|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to provide electric power in underground environments brings the capital and maintenance costs of such routes closer to those of light rail, and raises the question of building or eventually converting to light rail. In Seattle, the downtown transit tunnel was retrofitted for conversion to a shared hybrid-bus and light-rail facility in preparation for Seattle's Central [[Link Light Rail]] line, which opened in July 2009.

== Performance ==
{{See also|BRT Standard}}
A BRT system can be measured by a number of factors. The [[BRT Standard]] was developed by the [[Institute for Transportation and Development Policy]] (ITDP) to score BRT corridors, producing a [[BRT Standard#Scored BRT Corridors|list of rated BRT corridors]] meeting the minimum definition of BRT. The highest rated systems received a "gold" ranking. The latest edition of the standard was published in 2014.&lt;ref name=BRTstd2014&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Institute for Transportation and Development Policy]] (ITDP)|publisher=ITDP|title=About the Standard: What's New in 2014?
|url=https://go.itdp.org/display/live/About+the+BRT+Standard|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other metrics used to evaluate BRT performance include:
* The vehicle headway is the average time interval between vehicles on the same line. Buses can operate at headways of 10 seconds or less, but average headways on TransMilenio at busy intersections are 13 seconds,&lt;ref name="NBRTI report"&gt;[http://www.nbrti.org/docs/pdf/Bogota%20Report_Final%20Report_May%202006.pdf "Applicability of Bogotá's TransMilenio BRT System to the United States"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726014111/http://www.nbrti.org/docs/pdf/Bogota%20Report_Final%20Report_May%202006.pdf |date=26 July 2011 }} NBRTI (May 2006). Retrieved 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 14 seconds for the busiest section of the [[Metrobus (Istanbul)]].
* Vehicle capacity, which can range from 50 for a conventional bus up to some 200 for an articulated vehicle arranged for [[standing passenger]]s. Merobus Istanbul operates both [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] with a capacity of 150 and [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro|Mercedes CapaCity]] with a capacity of 193.
* The effectiveness of the stations to handle passenger demand. High volumes of passengers on vehicles required large bus stations at busy interchange points.
* The effectiveness of the feeder system&amp;nbsp;— can these deliver people to stations at the required speed.
* Local passenger demand. Without a local demand for travel, the capacity will not be used.

Based on this data, the minimum headway and maximum current vehicle capacities, the theoretical maximum throughput measured in [[passengers per hour per direction]] (PPHPD) for a single traffic lane is some 90,000 passengers per hour (250 passengers per vehicle, one vehicles every 10 seconds). In real world conditions TransMilenio holds the record, with 35,000 – 40,000 PPHPD with most other busy systems operating in the 15,000 to 25,000 range.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Comparison with light rail ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
After the first BRT system opened in 1974, cities were slow to adopt BRT because they believed that the capacity of BRT was limited to about 12,000 passengers per hour traveling in a given direction during peak demand. While this is a capacity rarely needed in the US (12,000 is more typical as a total daily ridership), in the developing world this capacity constraint was a significant argument in favor of heavy rail metro investments in some venues.

When TransMilenio opened in 2000, it changed the paradigm by giving buses a passing lane at each station stop and introducing express services within the BRT infrastructure.  These innovations increased the maximum achieved capacity of a BRT system to 35,000 passengers per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/More-Development-For-Your-Transit-Dollar_ITDP.pdf|title=More Development For Your Transit Dollar. An Analysis of 21 North American Transit Corridors.|page=20|author=W. Hook, S. Lotshaw and A. Weinstock|publisher=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light rail, by comparison, has reported passenger capacities between 3,500pph (mainly street running) to 19,000pph (fully [[Grade-separated]]). "From these findings … there is little evidence to support the view that [light rail] can carry more than busways.".&lt;ref&gt;G. Gardner, J. C. Rutter and F. Kuhn (1994). ''The performance and potential of light rail transit in developing cities.'' Project Report No. PR69. Transport Research Laboratory, Crowthorne, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; There are conditions that favor light over BRT, but they are fairly narrow. To meet these conditions you would need a corridor with only one available lane in each direction, more than 16,000 passengers per direction per hour but less than 20,000, and a long block length, because the train cannot block intersections. These conditions are rare, but in that specific instance, light rail would have a significant operational advantage. However, "... any perceived advantages of [light rail] over BRT are primarily aesthetic and political rather than technical … due to the perceived capacity constraint of BRT there are currently no cases in the US where [light rail] should be favored over BRT."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/More-Development-For-Your-Transit-Dollar_ITDP.pdf|title=More Development For Your Transit Dollar.

=== Comparison with conventional bus services ===
[[File:Chang'an avenue in Beijing.jpg|thumb|Conventional bus services being delayed by [[traffic congestion]] on [[Chang'an Avenue]] in [[Beijing]]]]
Conventional scheduled bus services use general traffic lanes, which can be slow due to [[traffic congestion]], and the speed of bus services is further reduced by long [[Dwell time (transportation)|dwell times]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2013, the New York City authorities noted that buses on [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], which carried 33,000 bus riders a day on local and express routes, traveled at {{convert|4.5|mph|km/h}}, only slightly faster than walking pace. Even despite the implementation of [[Select Bus Service]] (New York City's version of a bus rapid transit system), dedicated bus lanes, and traffic cameras on the 34th Street corridor, buses on the corridor were still found to travel at an average of 4.5&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/brt/html/routes/34th_transit.shtml|title=34th Street Select Bus Service|quote=Bus service along 34th Street is among the slowest in the city.

Despite these slow speeds, 34th Street is a major east-west bus corridor, carrying over 33,000 bus riders a day on local and express routes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, [[Reuben Smeed]] predicted that the average speed of traffic in central London would be {{convert|9|mph}} without other disincentives such as [[road pricing]], based on the theory that this was the minimum speed that people will tolerate. When the [[London congestion charge]] was introduced in 2003, the average traffic speed was indeed {{convert|14|km/h}} which was the highest speed since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/fifth-annual-impacts-monitoring-report-2007-07-07.pdf|title=Impacts monitoring&amp;nbsp;— fifty annual report|work=Transport for London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, typical speeds of BRT systems range from {{convert|17|to|30|mph}}.&lt;ref name="nbrti.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbrti.org/docs/pdf/Characteristics_BRT_Decision-Making.pdf|title=Characteristics of BRT for decision making.|page=ES-5|publisher=Federal Transit Administration|date=1 August 2004|access-date=8 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415111548/http://www.nbrti.org/docs/pdf/Characteristics_BRT_Decision-Making.pdf|archive-date=15 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
[[File:Saichi-stn-BRT03.jpg|thumb|[[Kesennuma Line]] in Japan damaged in 2011 tsunami. JR proposed the line's conversion into a dedicated bus rapid transit (BRT) route, before the railway's full restoration.]]
The capital costs of implementing BRT are lower than for light rail. A study by the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] from 2000 found that the average capital cost per mile for busways was $13.5 million while light rail average costs were $34.8 million.&lt;ref name="GAO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d01984.pdf|title=Bus Rapid Transit Shows Promise|author=GAO|date=September 2001|publisher=GAO|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the total investment varies considerably due to factors such as cost of the roadway, amount of grade separation, station structures, traffic signal systems and vehicles.

Operational costs of running a BRT system are generally lower than light rail, though the exact comparison varies, and labor costs depend heavily on the wages which vary between countries. For the same level of ridership and demand, higher labor costs in the developed world relative to developing countries will tend to encourage developed world transit operators to prefer operate services with larger but less frequent vehicles. This will allow the service to achieve the same capacity while minimizing the number of drivers. This may come as a hidden cost to passengers in lower demand routes who experience a significantly lower frequencies and longer waiting times. In the developing world the operating cost advantages of BRT over light rail or streetcar are much greater due to lower wages.&lt;ref name="lightrailnow.org"&gt;[http://www.lightrailnow.org/facts/fa_brt007.htm Bus Rapid Transit or Quality Bus Reality Check] Light Rail Now! (22 January 2004). Retrieved 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the study done by the GAO, BRT systems usually had lower costs based on "operating cost per vehicle hour", "operating cost per revenue mile", and "operating cost per passenger trip", mainly because of lower vehicle cost and lower infrastructure cost. The initial capital costs of diesel BRT are also much less lower than a [[trolleybus]] system.&lt;ref name="GAO" /&gt;

Proponents of light rail argue that the operating costs of BRT are not necessarily lower than light rail. The typically larger light rail vehicles enjoy reduced labor costs per passenger, and the unit capital cost per passenger can be lower than BRT.&lt;ref name="lightrailnow.org"/&gt; Furthermore, light rail vehicles have proven useful lifespans of forty years or more, as opposed to buses that often have to be replaced after less than twenty years.

An ambitious light rail system runs partly underground, which gives free right-of-way and much faster traffic compared to passing the traffic signals needed in a surface level system. Underground BRT is rare and expensive. As most buses run on diesel, air quality can become a significant concern in tunnels, but the [[Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel]] is an example of using hybrid buses, which switch to overhead electric propulsion while they are underground, eliminating diesel emissions and reducing fuel usage. An alternative is an elevated busway, which is also costly. A desire for grade separation indicates that a rail alternative may be better.[[File:Mettis BRT Metz.jpg|thumb|Prominent articulated "tram-like" [[Van Hool]] vehicles are used in [[Metz]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanhool.be/ENG/highlights/vanhoolpresentst.html|title=Van Hool presents the ExquiCity Design Mettis.|accessdate=5 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605074801/http://www.vanhool.be/ENG/highlights/vanhoolpresentst.html|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Criticism ==
BRT systems have been widely promoted by [[non-governmental organizations]] such as the Shell-funded EMBARQ program, [[Rockefeller Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Benjamin|title=Big Philanthropy Takes the Bus|url=https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/brt-bus-rapid-transit-big-philanthropy-oil-lobby|website=Dissent|publisher=Dissent|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Institute for Transportation and Development Policy]] (ITDP), whose consultant pool includes the former mayor of Bogota ([[Colombia]]), [[Enrique Penalosa]] (former president of ITDP).

Supported by contributions of bus-producing companies such as [[Volvo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Peñalosa y su trancón de intereses | date = 24 January 2016 | work = Al Garete | url = https://algarete.com.co/2016/01/24/penalosa-y-su-trancon-de-intereses/ | language = Spanish | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160501102439/https://algarete.com.co/2016/01/24/penalosa-y-su-trancon-de-intereses/ | archivedate = 1 May 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ITDP not only established a proposed "standard" for BRT system implementation, but developed intensive lobby activities around the world to convince local governments to select BRT systems over rail-based transportation models (subways, light trains, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Si Peñalosa no va a la ciudad, la ciudad va a Peñalosa | date = 7 March 2016 | work = Al Garete | url = http://algarete.com.co/2016/03/07/si-penalosa-no-va-a-la-ciudad-la-ciudad-va-a-penalosa/ | language = Spanish | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160506024550/https://algarete.com.co/2016/03/07/si-penalosa-no-va-a-la-ciudad-la-ciudad-va-a-penalosa/ | archivedate = 6 May 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Environmental issues ===

Unlike [[Electric multiple unit|electric-powered trains]] commonly used in rapid transit and light rail systems, bus rapid transit often uses diesel- or [[gasoline]]-fueled engines. The typical bus diesel engine causes noticeable levels of air pollution, noise and vibration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/otaq/consumer/420f08026.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted however that BRT can still provide significant environmental benefits over private cars. In addition, BRT systems can replace an inefficient conventional bus network for more efficient, faster and less polluting BRT buses. For example, Bogotá previously used 2,700 conventional buses providing transportation to 1.6 million passengers daily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/es/articulos/historia|title=Historia|publisher=Alcaldía de Bogotá – Transmilenio|accessdate=20 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919011327/http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/es/articulos/historia|archivedate=19 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2013 TransMilenio transported 1.9 million passengers using only 630 BRT buses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/sites/default/files/informe_de_gestion_tmsa_2013_vf.pdf|title=Informe de gestión de Transmilenio 2013 – page 18|publisher=Transmilenio, Alcaldía de Bogotá|accessdate=20 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018092300/http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/sites/default/files/informe_de_gestion_tmsa_2013_vf.pdf|archivedate=18 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fleet less than a quarter in size of the old fleet, that circulates at twice the speed, with a huge reduction in air pollution.

To reduce direct emissions some systems use alternative forms of traction such as electric or [[hybrid vehicles|hybrid engines]]. BRT systems can use trolleybuses to lower air pollution and noise emissions such as those in [[Beijing Bus|Beijing]] and [[Trolleybuses in Quito|Quito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trolleycoalition.org/noise.html|title=Edmonton Trolley Coalition|work=trolleycoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price penalty of installing [[overhead lines]] could be offset by the environmental benefits and potential for savings from centrally generated electricity, especially in cities where electricity is less expensive than other fuel sources. Trolleybus electrical systems can be potentially reused for future light rail conversion. TransJakarta buses, uses cleaner [[compressed natural gas]]-fueled engines. While Bogotá started to use hybrid buses in 2012: they use [[regenerative braking]] to charge batteries when the bus stops and then use electric motors to propel the bus up to 40&amp;nbsp;km/h, speed at which the regular diesel engine starts automatically, with considerable savings in fuel consumption and pollutant dispersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/es/articulos/inicio-operacion-de-buses-hibridos|title=Inicio de operación de buses híbridos|publisher=Alcaldía de Bogotá – Transmilenio|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018092300/http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/es/articulos/inicio-operacion-de-buses-hibridos|archivedate=18 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the lifetime of individual buses is generally shorter than their rail-based counterparts, potentially making the BRT system more expensive to operate in the long term.

=== Overcrowding and poor quality service  ===
[[File:TransMilenio-traffic-jam.jpg|thumb|Traffic jam at TransMilenio's dedicated line]]
Many BRT systems suffer from overcrowding in buses and stations as well as long wait times for buses. In [[Santiago de Chile]] the average of the system is six passengers per square meter inside vehicles. Users have reported days where the buses take too long to arrive, and are usually too overcrowded to accept new passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = El pecado original que determinó el fracaso del Transantiago|url =http://radio.uchile.cl/2017/02/10/el-pecado-original-que-determino-el-fracaso-del-transantiago/|website = Diario UChile|date = 2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2017 the system has 15% of approval from the users and has lost 27% of its passengers, who have turned mostly to cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 años de Transantiago: su deterioro y su reemplazo|url =http://www.algarete.com.co/10-anos-de-transantiago-su-deterioro-y-su-reemplazo/|website = Algarete (in spanish)|date = 2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bogotá]] the overcrowding is even worse; the average of [[TransMilenio]] is eight passengers per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ¿Por qué colapsó TransMilenio? |url =http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/transmilenio-colapso/379695-3|website = Revista Semana|date = 2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 29% feel satisfied with the system. The data also show that 23% of the citizens agree with building more TransMilenio lines, in contrast of the 42% who consider that a [[rapid transit]] system should be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = El futuro de Transmilenio|url =http://www.bogotacomovamos.org/blog/el-futuro-de-transmilenio/|website = Bogota como vamos|date = 2014-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Several cases of sexual assault have been reported by female users in TransMilenio. According to a 2012 survey made by the secretary of the woman of Bogota, 64% of women said they had been victims of sexual assault in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Preocupantes cifras de acoso a mujeres en Transmilenio|url =http://www.noticiasrcn.com/nacional-bogota/preocupantes-cifras-acoso-mujeres-transmilenio|website=noticias RCN|date = 2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has even been ranked as the most dangerous transport for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EXCLUSIVE-POLL: Latin American cities have most dangerous transport for women, NYC best |url =http://news.trust.org//item/20141028235939-edprr/|website = Thomas Reuters Foundation News|date = 2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The bad quality of the system has occasioned an increment in the number of cars and motorcycles in the city, the citizens prefer these transport means over TransMilenio. According to official data the number of cars increased from approximately 666.000 in 2005 to 1.586.700 in 2016; the number of motorcycles is also growing, 660.000 were sold in Bogota in 2013, twice the number of cars sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Los 10 problemas más graves de Bogotá |url =http://www.dw.com/es/los-10-problemas-m%C3%A1s-graves-de-bogot%C3%A1/g-36068986|website = Deustche Welle|date = 2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jakarta]] there have been also reports of overcrowding in buses and stations, low frequency of the routes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algarete.com.co/transjakarta-otro-caso-de-exito/|title=Transjakarta : Otro caso de "éxito"|website=algarete (in spanish)|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many reports of sexual harassment cases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/another-alleged-sexual-harassment-at-transjakarta-station/ |title=Another Alleged Sexual Harassment at TransJakarta Station|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|date=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as problems with buses that burn on their own. The quality of the service is so bad that in 2015 the Jakarta governor apologized for the bad service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalindonesianvoices.com/19617/jakarta-governor-apologizes-for-lees-than-optimal-transjakarta-busway-services/|title=Jakarta governor apoligezes for less than optimal Transjakarta busway services|website=Global indonesian voices|date=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failures and reversals ===
[[File:Pt.jpg|thumb|Protests in [[TransMilenio]] at the [[Terreros (TransMilenio)|Terreros]] station, 12 February 2016]]
A principal criticism of BRT systems is that they may not accomplish their promise of an efficient, rapid flow of passengers along their dedicated bus lanes. The remarkable fiasco of [[Delhi]]'s BRT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 18 January 2016 |title= Delhi’s BRT Corridor to be demolished! |work= News Mobile |url= http://www.newsmobile.in/articles/2016/01/18/delhis-brt-corridor-to-be-demolished/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the increasing riots and spontaneous user demonstrations in Bogotá&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Bloqueo TransMilenio | work = El Tiempo |url= http://www.eltiempo.com/noticias/bloqueo-transmilenio |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; raise doubts about the ability of BRTs to tackle issues such as the traffic jams induced by dedicated lanes. Overcrowded stations and BRT vehicles may fail to keep pace with increased ridership, and may eventually need to be replaced with high-capacity rail systems.

The lack of permanence of BRT has also been criticized, with some arguing that BRT systems can be used as an excuse to build roads that others later try to convert for use by non-BRT vehicles. Examples of this can be found in Delhi, where a BRT system was scrapped,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lalchandani |first1=Neha|title=BRT will be scrapped, decides Arvind Kejriwal|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/BRT-will-be-scrapped-decides-Arvind-Kejriwal/articleshow/46708947.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Aspen, Colorado]], where drivers are lobbying the government to allow mixed-use traffic in former BRT lanes as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Rick|title=Aspen candidates mull citizen’s proposal to open bus lanes to all vehicles|url=http://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-candidates-mull-citizens-proposal-to-open-bus-lanes-to-all-vehicles/|website=The Aspen Times|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the [[Belfast]] Chamber of Trade and Commerce has called for bus lanes to be scrapped in certain areas of the city "as an experiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade body in 'scrap bus lanes' call|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38316153|website=BBC News|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangkok was also making plans to scrap a set of bus-only lanes, as of early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PBS|first1=Thai|title=BRT bus service to stop end of April|url=http://www.pattayamail.com/thailandnews/brt-bus-service-stop-end-april-163752|website=Pattaya Mail|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Orleans ran buses on Canal Street in a dedicated right of way beginning in the 1960s. This style of service was maintained until 2004 when streetcar service was restored on this {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} route segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetcarmike.com/nopsi_flxible.html|title=New Orleans Public Service Inc. (NOPSI) Flxible New Look Buses 168-195 &amp; 314-409 @ streetcarmike.com|work=streetcarmike.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perceived lack of permanence has made BRT lines significantly less attractive to real estate developers than rail lines.

Experts also attribute the failure of BRT to land use structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/947211468162273111/pdf/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf|title=Transforming Cities with Transit: Transit and Land-Use Integration for Sustainable Urban Development|last=Suzuki|first=Hiroaki|last2=Cervero|first2=Robert|publisher=The World Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/south-africa-needs-to-revamp-its-new-public-transport-system-84930|title=South Africa needs to revamp its new public transport system|last=Venter|first=Christo|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities that are sprawled and have no mixed use have poor ridership to make BRT economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/transport-and-tourism/2017-07-10-bus-rapid-transit-system-on-road-to-nowhere-in-gauteng/|title=Bus Rapid Transit system on road to nowhere in Gauteng|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, the [https://www.africaurban.org African Urban Institute] criticized the viability of ongoing BRTs across the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.africaurban.org/harare-ready-bus-rapid-transit-system/|title=Is Harare ready for Bus Rapid Transit System?|last=Muzenda|first=Archimedes|date=|website=|publisher=African Urban Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907144741/https://www.africaurban.org/harare-ready-bus-rapid-transit-system/|archive-date=2018-09-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacing BRT with higher capacity modes===
While the Los Angeles Metro [[Orange Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Orange Line]] is sometimes cured as an example of a successful North American BRT line, its very success has led to overcrowding and long term plans to replace it with a rail line. The problem in replacing an existing BRT corridor with a rail line is that service disruptions are unavoidable during construction and this lack of reliability may hurt ridership.

==  Impact ==
A 2018 study found that the introduction of a BRT network in Mexico City reduced air pollution (emissions of CO, NOX, and PM10).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-01|title=Evaluation of the impact of Bus Rapid Transit on air pollution in Mexico City|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X17301592|journal=Transport Policy|language=en|volume=63|pages=209–220|doi=10.1016/j.tranpol.2018.01.001|issn=0967-070X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2075">In [[molecular nanotechnology]], '''chemosynthesis''' is any [[chemical synthesis]] where [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] occur due to random thermal motion, a class which encompasses almost all of modern synthetic chemistry.  The human-authored processes of [[chemical engineering]] are accordingly represented as [[biomimicry]] of the natural phenomena above, and the entire class of non-photosynthetic chains by which complex molecules are constructed is described as '''chemo-'''.

This form of engineering is then contrasted with [[mechanosynthesis]], a hypothetical process where individual [[molecule]]s are mechanically manipulated to control reactions to human specification.  Since [[photosynthesis]] and other natural processes create extremely complex molecules to the specifications contained in [[RNA]] and stored long-term in [[DNA]] form, advocates of [[molecular engineering]] claim that an artificial process can likewise exploit a chain of long-term storage, short-term storage, [[enzyme]]-like copying mechanisms similar to those in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], and ultimately produce complex molecules which need not be [[protein]]s.  For instance, [[sheet diamond]] or [[carbon nanotube]]s could be produced by a chain of non-biological reactions that have been designed using the basic model of biology.

Use of the term ''chemosynthesis'' reinforces the view that this is feasible by pointing out that several alternate means of creating complex proteins, mineral shells of mollusks and crustaceans, etc., evolved naturally, not all of them dependent on photosynthesis and a [[food chain]] from the sun via [[chlorophyll]].  Since more than one such pathway exists to creating complex molecules, even extremely specific ones such as [[protein]]s edible to [[fish]], the likelihood of humans being able to design an entirely new one is considered (by these advocates) to be near certainty in the long run, and possible within a generation.

'''Clesh''' (clip load edit share) is a [[Cloud computing|cloud-based]] [[video editing]] platform designed for the consumers, [[prosumer]]s, and [[online]] communities to integrate user generated content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mrl.nott.ac.uk/~bnk/Teaching/MIA/guestLecture.pdf|title=media trends and directions including process and tooling|accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyu.edu/tisch/preservation/program/student_work/2006spring/06s_thesis_campbell.pdf|title=Thesis on preservation services for audio visual media material|accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core technology is based on [[FORscene]] which is geared towards professionals working for example in [[broadcasting]], [[news media]], [[Post-production|post production]].

Video, audio, and graphical content is uploaded to Clesh via a standard web browser, a mobile device such as a [[Nokia N900|phone]] / [[Samsung Galaxy Tab|tablet]], or [[Desktop computer|desktop]] software for [[DV]] capture over [[Firewire]].  The [[Video hosting|hosted material]] can then be reviewed, searched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyu.edu/tisch/preservation/program/student_work/2005fall/05f_1803_campbell_a3.pdf|title=Paper on the theory and technology of moving image indexing|accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited, and published online by anyone with a standard web browser or compatible mobile device.

Clesh supports storyboard shot selection, frame-accurate editing, transitions and various other functions such as; pan, zoom, colour and light correction, and audio levels.  Content can be published in formats for example; [[Podcast]], [[Mpeg2]], [[HTML5 video]] or in a proprietary [[Java (software platform)|Java format]].

Cloud-based software provides greater scope for sharing information and collaborating compared to [[Local area network|LAN]] or desktop based systems.  Users of cloud-based software rely on the cloud's owner for adequate [[Securely collaborating in clouds|security]], [[Cloud-based networking|performance and resilience]].

Clesh does not assert any rights over uploaded content in contrast to other platforms (such as [[YouTube]]). All rights to any content uploaded to Clesh remain with the Author.

==Features==
Some of the services available to Clesh users:
* Access via [[JRE|Java]] enabled desktops or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[smartphone]]s or [[Tablet computer|tablets]]
* Real-time video rendering including effects and transitions
* Multiple audio tracks
* Secured log-on
* Frame accurate timeline for fine cut editing
* Logging / meta-data annotation assigns text to portions of video (usable by Clesh and [[web search engine]]s)
* Storyboard  assembles rough cuts using drag-and-drop
* Import, host, organise and search for media (DV tape and various video, audio, and still image formats)
* Publish content to in formats such as [[MPEG-4|podcast]], [[MPEG-2]], web ([[Java Applet]]), [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Ogg]], HTML5 and [[JPEG]]
* Chatrooms to talk to other Clesh users

* Moderation for approval of material prior to distribution downstream
* Re-branding and integration support for white-label deployment

==Technology==
Clesh is based on the same technology as FORscene. An array of servers on the [[internet backbone]] provide the cloud computing platform to host Clesh.  As a [[White-label product|white-label]] solution Clesh would be branded and hosted per the client requirement.

==User Interface==
[[End-user]]s access Clesh with a [[Rich UI|rich]] user interface on clients such as standard Java-enabled [[Web browser|Web Browsers]] and / or  Android enabled [[mobile device]]s such as tablets and smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClelland |first=David |url=http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/mobile-phones/how-to-make-hd-movies-on-your-samsung-galaxy-s3-50008764/ |title=How to make HD movies on your Samsung Galaxy S3 - CNET |publisher=Reviews.cnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Clesh was launched January 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Tyerman |url=http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/company/articles/FBT/23341/more-fruits-from-forbidden.thtml |title=More fruits from Forbidden |publisher=Growthcompany.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subject to several upgrades during the year to extend functionality including; storyboard, podcasting, moderation, chat and a showreel. During 2007 consumers are offered Clesh via a subscription model. Upgrades include Web Start and graphics upload. Mr Paparazzi selects Clesh as the platform to host its video offering and TrueTube does the same in 2008 by choosing to use Clesh to manage its video portal. Several further upgrades are applied and include; better audio quality, image enhancement controls, transitions, fades, titles, and additional publishing options such as JPEG.  In 2010 a version of Clesh is demonstrated on an Android OS tablet device (Samsung Galaxy S Tab), and several upgrades are applied including; HTML5 publishing, pan, zoom, and overlays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">A '''constant phase element''' is an [[equivalent electrical circuit]] component that models the behaviour of a [[double layer (electrode)|double layer]], that is an imperfect [[capacitor]].

Constant phase elements are also used in equivalent circuit modelling and data fitting of [[electrochemical impedance spectroscopy]] data.

A constant phase element also appears currently in modeling the behaviour of the imperfect dielectrics. The generalization in the fields of imperfect electrical resistances, capacitances and inductances leads to the general "Phasance" concept: http://fr.scribd.com/doc/71923015/The-Phasance-Concept

== General equation ==

The electrical [[electrical impedance|impedance]] can be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{CPE}=\frac{1}{Y_{CPE}}=\frac{1}{Q_0\omega^n}e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}ni}&lt;/math&gt;
where the CPE [[admittance]] is: &lt;math&gt;Y_{CPE}=Q_0(\omega i)^n&lt;/math&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and n (0&lt;n&lt;1) are frequency independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kochowski|first=S|author2=K. Nitsch|title=Description of the frequency behaviour of metal-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-GaAs structure characteristics by electrical equivalent circuit with constant phase element|journal=Thin Solid Films|date=21 May 2002|volume=415|pages=133–137|url=http://144.206.159.178/ft/1035/72608/14075937.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2012|doi=10.1016/s0040-6090(02)00506-0|bibcode = 2002TSF...415..133K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/|Z| at ω = 1 rad/s

The constant phase is always −(90*n)°, also with n from 0 to 1. The case n = 1 describes an ideal capacitor while the case n = 0 describes a pure [[resistor]].

'''DailyTech''' was an online daily publication of technology news, founded by ex-[[AnandTech]] editor [[Kristopher Kubicki (journalist)|Kristopher Kubicki]] on January 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dailytech#section-overview  DailyTech ]&lt;/ref&gt; The site features a prominent "comments" section that acts as the forums for the publication.  Users are able to moderate or respond to each post, a template the editor admits borrowing from [[Slashdot]].  The operating revenue for DailyTech is primarily dependent on advertising, with syndication of their news feed also providing some revenue. As of early December 2015 the website seems inactive without any notice.  In mid July 2016, the web address quit functioning but has since resumed and new articles are being published regularly again.

The website is split up into two sections: "news" and "[[blog]]s."  Both appear on the front page, though blogs are sectioned off and declared differently in the title.  News content on the site primarily consists of computer-related hardware news, but also includes a variety of science, defense and consumer-tech information.  

The schism between DailyTech and AnandTech occurred in goodwill, with the goal of establishing DailyTech as a news site that would not be bound by the [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDAs]] that AnandTech has signed. Anand Lal Shimpi is frequently quoted and featured on DailyTech; however, the two publications compete against each other for readership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/blogs/bio.aspx?user=14 DailyTech Editor-in-Chief mission statement]&lt;/ref&gt; The DailyTech news feed is also used by other technology and science websites.

==Writing style==
DailyTech combines blog-style news with industry interviews and frequent roadmap leaks.  The DailyTech editor has a frequent history of run-ins with writers from other publications.  He has publicly denounced the writings from competitor [[Tom's Hardware]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sven | last=Olsen | title=Core Duo Battery Drain Bug Demystified|url=http://dailytech.com/Article.aspx?newsid=775}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gizmodo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kristopher | last=Kubicki | title=On Whining and Embargoes | url=http://www.dailytech.com/On+Whining+and+Embargoes+Dont+Put+the+Cat+in+the+Bag/article8649.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HardOCP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kristopher |last=Kubicki |title=To Name or Not to Name? |url=http://kristopher.us/2007/06/to-name-or-not-to-name.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618163850/http://kristopher.us/2007/06/to-name-or-not-to-name.html |archivedate=2007-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Inquirer]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anh T. | last=Huynh | url=http://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=3400 | title="Rydermark" Cheating Allegations Discreted}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DigiTimes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kristopher | last=Kubicki | title=DailyTech Digest: Radeon HD Defect Feedback Demystified|url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=8415}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the site owners do not censor comments.

DailyTech has consistently leaked several generations of [[GPU]]s and [[CPU]]s.  The company attributes this to the standing instruction that DailyTech writers are not allowed to sign disclosure agreements or embargoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Kristopher| last=Kubicki| url=http://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=3400&amp;commentid=47657&amp;threshhold=1&amp;red=3510#comments | title=DailyTech does not sign NDAs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2007, the site published a report on the levels of corruption present at other technology news and review websites.  7 out of 35 site polled accepted some kind of advertising-for-content exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Scott | last=Wasson | url=http://techreport.com/onearticle.x/12605 | title=DailyTech tracks payola in hardware review sites | publisher=TheTechReport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristopher | last=Kubicki | url=http://dailytech.com/Pay+to+Play+Uncovering+Online+Payola/article7510.htm | title=Pay to Play: Uncovering Online Payola}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Aneglina |last=Gunn |url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/techspace/2007/06/reviewing_techj.html?csp=34 |title=DailyTech: Reviewing tech-journalism ethics |publisher=USAToday |date=September 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210064004/http://blogs.usatoday.com/techspace/2007/06/reviewing_techj.html?csp=34 |archivedate=2008-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[software quality]], '''defect criticality''' is a measure of the impact of a software defect. It is defined as the product of severity, likelihood, and class.

Defects are different from [[user story|user stories]], and therefore the priority (severity) should be calculated as follows.

==Severity/Impact==

* 0 - Affects critical data or functionality and leaves users with no workaround
* 1 - Affects critical data or functionality and forces users to employ a workaround
* 2 - Affects non-critical data or functionality and forces users to employ a workaround
* 3 - Affects non-critical data or functionality and does not force users to employ a workaround
* 4 - Affects aesthetics, professional look and feel, “quality” or “usability”

==Likelihood/Visibility==

* 1 - Seen by all or almost all users who use the application (&gt;=95% of users)
* 2 - Seen by more than 2/3 of the users who use the application (&gt;67% and &lt;95%)
* 3 - Seen by about half the users who use the application (&gt;33% and &lt;66%)
* 4 - Seen by about 1/3 or less of the users who use the application (&gt;0% and &lt;32%)

==Class of defect==

===Class 0===
* Stability, Reliability and Availability
* Security
* Legal (Liability, ADA, Copyright)
* Testability
* Storage (data loss/corruption)

===Class 1===
* Performance and Efficiency (use of resources: memory, disk, CPU)
* Scalability

===Class 2===
* Functionality
* Logic or Calculation
* Compatibility
* Interoperability

===Class 3===
* Usability
* Learn ability
* Readability
* Documentation
* Consistency
* Workflow (“feel”)

===Class 4===
* Typographic or grammatical
* Aesthetics
* Appearance or Cosmetic

==Assessing the criticality score==
*0-2 = Critical
*3-9 = Major
*10-20 = Medium
*21-64 = Low

[[File:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical "portable" dehumidifier can be moved about on built-in casters]]
A '''dehumidifier''' is an [[Small appliance|electrical appliance]] which reduces and maintains the level of [[humidity]] in the air, usually for health or comfort reasons, or to eliminate musty [[odor]] and to prevent the growth of [[mildew]] by extracting water from the air. It can be used for household, commercial, or industrial applications. Large dehumidifiers are used in commercial buildings such as indoor [[ice rink]]s and [[swimming pool]]s, as well as manufacturing plants or storage warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Technical Guidelines of an Ice Rink|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|url=http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Sport/Chapter3.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2015|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Dehumidifiers extract water from air that passes through the unit. There are two types of dehumidifiers - condensate dehumidifiers and desiccant dehumidifiers.

Condensate dehumidifiers use a refrigerator to collect water known as [[Condensation reaction|condensate]], which is normally [[greywater]] but may at times be reused for industrial purposes. Some manufacturers offer reverse osmosis filters to turn the condensate into potable water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frigidaire|title=All about the Use &amp; Care of your Dehumidifier|year=2009|publisher=Electrolux Home Products, Inc.|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some designs, such as the ionic membrane dehumidifier, dispose of water as a vapor rather than liquid.

[[Desiccant]] dehumidifiers (known also as absorption dehumidifiers) bond moisture with hydrophilic materials such as [[silica gel]]. Cheap domestic units contain single-use hydrophilic substance cartridges, gel, and powder. Larger commercial units contain hot air recovery systems in order to remove humid air from outside the room.

The [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of dehumidifiers can vary widely.

==Thermal condensation dehumidification==
These methods rely on drawing air across a cold surface. Since the [[saturation vapor pressure]] of water decreases with decreasing temperature, the water in the air [[condensation|condenses]] on the surface, separating the water from the air.

===Refrigeration (electric)===
Electric refrigeration dehumidifiers are the most common type of dehumidifiers. They work by drawing moist air over a [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] evaporator with a fan. There are 3 main types of evaporators. They are coiled tube, fin and tube, and [[Microchannel (microtechnology)|microchannel]] technology.

The cold [[evaporator coil]] of the refrigeration device condenses the water, which is removed, and then the air is reheated by the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser coil]]. The now dehumidified, re-warmed air is released into the room. This process works most effectively at higher ambient temperatures with a high [[dew point]] temperature. In cold climates, the process is less effective. Highest efficiency is reached above {{convert|20|C|F}} and 45% relative humidity. This relative humidity value is higher if the temperature of the air is lower. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

This type of dehumidifier differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.

In addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier will always warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity more directly, by condensing and removing water.

[[File:Heat recovery.gif|thumb|center|Diagram showing airflow through a heat-recovering dehumidifier]]

Warm, moist air is drawn into the unit at A in the diagram above. This air passes into a crossflow plate heat exchanger (B) where a substantial proportion of the sensible heat is transferred to a cool supply air stream. This process brings the extracted air close to saturation. The air then passes to the plenum chamber of the extract fan (C) where a portion of it may be rejected to outside. The amount that is rejected can be varied and is
determined either by legislation on fresh air requirements, or by the requirement to maintain a fresh, odour free environment. The balance of the air then passes into the evaporator coil of the heat pump where it is cooled and the moisture is condensed. This process yields substantial amounts of latent energy to the refrigeration circuit. Fresh air is then introduced to replace the amount that was extracted and the mix is discharged by the supply fan (G) to the crossflow plate exchanger (B) where it is heated by the extract air from the pool. This pre-warmed air then passes through the heat pump condenser (F) where it is heated by the latent energy removed during the condensation process as well as the energy input to the compressor. The warm dry air is then discharged to the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://warmdrypools.co.uk/Casestudies/CarbonGobblers| title=Warm &amp; Dry dehumidifiers heat recovery in dehumidifiers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventional air conditioners===
A conventional [[Air conditioning|air conditioner]] is very similar to an electric dehumidifier and inherently acts as a dehumidifier when chilling the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=How Hot Do You Feel?|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/blog/138-how-hot-do-you-feel|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an air conditioner, however, the air passes over the cold evaporator coils and then directly into the room. It is not re-heated by passing over the condenser, as in a refrigeration dehumidifier. Instead, the refrigerant is pumped by the compressor to a condenser which is located outside the room to be conditioned, and the heat is then released to the outside air. Conventional air conditioners use additional energy exhausting air outside, and new air can have more moisture than the room needs, such as a pool room that already holds a high amount of moisture in the air.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dehumidifiercorp.com/swimming-pool-dehumidifiers Swimming Pool Room Dehumidifiers]", DCA, Retrieved June 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The water that condenses on the evaporator in an air conditioner is usually routed to remove extracted water from the conditioned space. Newer high-efficiency window units use the condensed water to help cool the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser coil]] by evaporating the water into the outdoor air, while older units simply allowed the water to drip outside.

===Spray Dehumidifiers===
When water is chilled below the atmospheric [[dewpoint]], atmospheric water will condense onto it faster than water evaporates from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.airconditioning-systems.com/dehumidifier.html|title=Dehumidifier|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spray dehumidifiers mix sprays of chilled water and air to capture atmospheric moisture.  They also capture pollutants and contaminants like pollen, for which purpose they are sometimes called "air washers".

===Makeshift dehumidifiers===
Because window air conditioner units have condensers and expansion units, some of them can be used as makeshift dehumidifiers by sending their heat exhaust back into the same room as the cooled air, instead of the outside environment. If the condensate from the cooling coils is drained away from the room as it drips off the cooling coils, the result will be room air that is drier but slightly warmer.

However, many window air conditioners are designed to dispose of condensate water by re-evaporating it into the exhaust air stream, which cancels out the air humidity decrease caused by the condensation of moisture on the cooling coils. To be effective as a dehumidifier, an air conditioner must be designed or modified so that most or all of the water that condenses is drained away in liquid form, rather than re-evaporated. Even if condensate is drained, a modified air conditioner is still less efficient than a single-purpose appliance with a design optimized for dehumidification. Dehumidifiers are designed to pass air directly over the cooling coils and then the heating coils in a single efficient pass through the device.

In addition, most air conditioners are controlled by a [[thermostat]] which senses temperature, rather than a [[humidistat]] that senses humidity and is typically used to control a dehumidifier. A thermostat is not designed for the control of humidity, and controls it poorly if at all.

===Ice buildup===
Under certain conditions of temperature and humidity, [[ice]] can form on a refrigeration dehumidifier's [[evaporator coil]]s. The ice buildup can impede airflow and eventually form a solid block encasing the coils. This buildup prevents the dehumidifier from operating effectively, and can cause water damage if condensed water drips off the accumulated ice and not into the collection tray. In extreme cases, the ice can deform or distort mechanical elements, causing permanent damage.

Better-quality dehumidifiers may have a frost or ice sensor. These will turn off the machine and allow the ice-covered coils to warm and defrost. Once defrosted, the machine will automatically restart. Most ice sensors are simple [[thermal switch]]es and do not directly sense the presence or absence of ice buildup. An alternative design senses the impeded airflow and shuts off the cooling coils in a similar manner.

===Thermoelectric dehumidifiers===
Thermoelectric dehumidifiers use a [[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier heat pump]] to cool a surface and condense water vapor from the air. The design is simpler and has the benefit of being quieter compared to a dehumidifier with a mechanical compressor. However, because of its  [[Thermoelectric cooling#Performance|relatively poor]] [[Coefficient of Performance]], this design is mainly used for small dehumidifiers. Ice buildup may be a problem, similar to problems with refrigeration dehumidifiers.

==Absorption/desiccant dehumidification==
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}
[[File:Adsorption - Desiccant dehumidifier TTK 55 S.jpg|thumb|alt=Mobile Adsorption dehumidifier|Portable adsorption dehumidifier]]
This process uses a special humidity-absorbing material called a [[desiccant]], which is exposed to the air to be conditioned. The humidity-saturated material is then moved to a different location, where it is "recharged" to drive off the humidity, typically by heating it. The desiccant can be mounted on a belt or other means of transporting it during a cycle of operation.

Dehumidifiers which work according to the absorption principle are especially suited for high humidity levels at low temperatures. They are often used in various sectors in industry because humidity levels below 35% can be achieved.

Because of the lack of compressor parts desiccant dehumidifiers are often lighter and quieter than compressor dehumidifiers. Desiccant dehumidifiers can also operate at lower temperatures than compressor dehumidifiers as the unit lacks coils which are unable to extract moisture from the air at lower temperatures.

==Ionic membrane dehumidification==
An ionic membrane can be used to move humidity into or out of a sealed enclosure, operating at a molecular level without involving visible liquid water.

The solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) membrane is a low power, steady-state dehumidifier for enclosed areas where maintenance is difficult. The electrolytic process delivers dehumidifying capacities up to 0.2 grams/day from a 0.2m³ (7 cu ft) space to 58 grams/day from an 8m³ (280 cu ft). SPE systems generally do not have high dehydration capacities, but because the water vapor is removed through electrolysis, the process is maintenance free. The process also requires very little electrical energy to operate, using no moving parts, making the ionic membranes silent in operation and very reliable over long periods of time.  SPE dehumidifiers are typically used to protect sensitive electrical components, medical equipment, museum specimens, or scientific apparatus from humid environments.

The SPE consists of a proton-conductive solid polymer electrolyte and porous electrodes with a catalytic layer composed of noble metal particles.&lt;ref name="RosahlWorks"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Rosahl works|url=http://www.rosahl.co.uk/rosahl/how-does-rosahl-work|work=Rosahl (website)|publisher=Ryosai Technica Company (Japan)|accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a voltage is applied to the porous electrode attached to the membrane, the moisture on the [[anode]] side (dehumidifying side) dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and oxygen. The hydrogen ions migrate through membrane to be discharged on the cathode (moisture discharging) side where they react with oxygen in the air, resulting in water molecules (vapor), being discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Journal of Applied Electro chemistry |volume=40 |issue=12 |pages=2153–2160|doi=10.1007/s10800-010-0197-4

==Condensate==
[[File:Mitsubishi Electric Oasis MJ-E16VX dehumidifier partially in parts 20071022.jpg|thumb|upright|Partially disassembled portable dehumidifier, with condensate bucket and white-colored float sensor visible at center]]

===Disposal===
Products using condensation technology has traditionally been using a cold surface where humidity in warm air is condensated. Today the warm condensation technology based on the concept of oversaturated steam inside a closed environment makes it possible to dehumidify air at sub zero temperatures. This is a very energy efficient technology and equally efficient in all temperatures.

Most portable dehumidifiers are equipped with a condensate collection receptacle, typically with a [[Float (liquid level)|float sensor]] that detects when the collection vessel is full, to shut off the dehumidifier and prevent an overflow of collected water. In a warm humid environments, these buckets will generally fill with water in 8–12 hours, and may need to be manually emptied and replaced several times per day to ensure continued operation.

Many portable dehumidifiers can also be adapted to connect the condensate drip output directly to a drain via a hose. Some dehumidifier models can tie into plumbing drains or use a built-in water pump to empty themselves as they collect moisture. Alternatively, a separate [[condensate pump]] may be used to move collected water to a disposal location when gravity drainage is not possible.

[[Air conditioning#Central (ducted) air conditioning|Central air conditioning]] units typically need to be connected to a drain, because the quantity of condensate water generated by such systems can be quite large over time. If the condensate water is directed into the sewer system, it should be suitably [[Trap (plumbing)|trapped]]. Otherwise, back pressure can allow smells or sewer gases to enter the building. The condensate should not be directed into a [[septic system]] of a house, because large central air conditioning systems discharge water that does not need to be treated by septic systems. If the height of the [[air handler]] (containing the evaporator) is above the ground level or in the attic of a house, condensate lines can also often be routed into rain gutters. Air handlers located in the basement of a house require [[condensate pump]]s to pump the water up to ground level.

===Potability===
Generally, dehumidifier water is considered a rather clean kind of [[greywater]]: not suitable for drinking, but acceptable for watering plants, though not garden vegetables.&lt;ref name="treehugger"&gt;{{cite web| first=John |last=Laumer|date=July 29, 2005|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/07/can_i_water_my.php |title=Can I Water My Plants With It?|publisher=TreeHugger.com|accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The health concerns are:&lt;ref name="treehugger"/&gt;{{refimprove inline|date=December 2017}}
* The water may contain trace metals from solder and other metallic parts, most significantly [[lead]] (which is quite dangerous), but also [[copper]], [[aluminum]], or [[zinc]]. The trace metals may pose a danger if used on edible plants, as they can [[bioaccumulate]]. However, the water is usable for [[irrigation]] of non-edible plants.
* Various [[pathogen]]s, including fungal spores, may accumulate in the water, particularly due to its stagnancy. Unlike in [[distilled water]] production, the water is not boiled, which would kill pathogens (including bacteria).
* As with distilled water, beneficial minerals are largely absent.

Food-grade dehumidifiers, also called [[atmospheric water generator]]s, are designed to avoid toxic metal contamination and to keep all water contact surfaces clean. The devices are primarily intended to produce pure water, and the dehumidifying effect is viewed as secondary to their operation.

==Maintenance==
If condensate water is handled automatically, most dehumidifiers require very little maintenance. Because of the volume of airflow through the appliance, dust buildup needs to be removed so it does not impede airflow; many designs feature removable and washable air filters. Condensate collection trays and containers may need occasional cleaning to remove debris buildup and prevent clogging of drainage passages, which can cause water leakage and overflow.

==Applications==

'''Dell''' is an [[United States|American]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] computer technology company based in [[Round Rock, Texas]], United States, that develops, sells, repairs, and supports computers and related products and services. Named after its founder, [[Michael Dell]], the company is one of the largest technological corporations in the world, employing more than 103,300 people in the U.S. and around the world.

Dell sells [[personal computer]]s (PCs), [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[data storage device]]s, [[network switch]]es, [[computer software|software]], computer [[peripheral]]s, [[HDTV]]s, cameras, printers, MP3 players, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is well known for its innovations in [[supply chain management]] and [[electronic commerce]], particularly its direct-sales model and its "build-to-order" or "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.&lt;ref name="bw1103"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-11-02/what-you-dont-know-about-dell|title=What you don't know about Dell|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|date=November 2, 2003|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statesman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/business/dell-selling-former-site-of-north-carolina-manufac/nTbTJ/|title=Dell selling former site of North Carolina manufacturing plant|publisher=statesman.com|accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, but with the acquisition in 2009 of [[Perot Systems]], Dell entered the market for IT services. The company has since made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim of expanding their portfolio from offering computers only to delivering complete solutions for enterprise customers.&lt;ref name="reut"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters Financial|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?rpc=66&amp;symbol=DELL.O|title=Dell company profile|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey|first=David|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-13/silver-lake-investors-said-to-see-dell-as-mixed-blessing.html|title=Silver Lake Investors Said to See Dell as Mixed Blessing|publisher=Bloomberg|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell was listed at number 51 in the ''[[Fortune 500]]'' list, until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dell – Fortune 500 2013 – Fortune |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2013/snapshots/1053.html |work=Fortune |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615044518/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2013/snapshots/1053.html |archivedate=June 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune.

In 2016, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm [[EMC Corporation]]; following the completion of the purchase, Dell and EMC became divisions of [[Dell Technologies]].

Dell traces its origins to 1984, when Michael Dell created Dell Computer Corporation, which at the time did business as ''PC's Limited'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/michael-dell-9542199 |title=Michael Dell Biography – Facts, Birthday, Life Story |publisher=Biography.com |date=February 23, 1965 |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Michael Dell with an early model of a PC’s Limited computer| url = http://pinterest.com/pin/208643395206891882/| accessdate = September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a student of the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. The dorm-room headquartered company sold [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC-compatible]] computers built from stock components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/about-dell-our-story.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp&amp;~ck=ln&amp;lnki=0&amp;redirect=1 |title=About Dell&amp;#124;History &amp;#124; Dell Österreich |publisher=Euro.dell.com |accessdate=September 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503071901/http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/about-dell-our-story.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp&amp;~ck=ln&amp;lnki=0&amp;redirect=1 |archivedate=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell dropped out of school to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family.
In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the ''Turbo PC'', which sold for $795.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Koehn |first=Nancy Fowler |title=Brand New: How Entrepreneurs Earned Consumers' Trust from Wedgwood to Dell |publisher=[[Harvard Business Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-57851-221-8 |page=287 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7j8VefeqUk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; PC's Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. The company [[gross profit|grossed]] more than $73&amp;nbsp;million in its first year of operation.

In 1986, Michael Dell brought in Lee Walker, a 51-year-old venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as Dell's mentor and implement Dell's ideas for growing the company. Walker was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988. Walker retired in 1990 due to health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of [[Electronic Data Systems]] to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/updates/thompson12e/case/dell4.html |title=Dell Computer Corporation Online Case |publisher=Mhhe.com |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company dropped the PC's Limited name in 1987 to become Dell Computer Corporation and began expanding globally. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30&amp;nbsp;million to $80&amp;nbsp;million from its June 22 [[initial public offering]] of 3.5&amp;nbsp;million shares at $8.50 a share.&lt;ref&gt;Website 1000ventures.com: Case study on:[http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/cs_im_dell.html Dell Inc.], visited: October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's [[Fortune Global 500|500]] largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.&lt;ref name=NatPressClub&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/npc/2000/000608.mdell.html|title=Michael Dell|work=National Press Club Summary|publisher=NPR|accessdate=May 28, 2012|date=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million in annual revenue. Bain consultant [[Kevin Rollins]] persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rivlin |first=Gary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/technology/11dell.html |title=He Naps. He Sings. And He Isn't Michael Dell. |work=The New York Times |date=September 11, 2005 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.&lt;ref name="mhhe.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/updates/thompson12e/case/dell3.html |title=Dell Computer Corporation Online Case |publisher=Mhhe.com |date=January 30, 1994 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins would soon join Dell full-time and eventually become the company President and CEO.

===Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s===
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low-profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company's Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997. While the industry's average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.&lt;ref name="mhhe.com"/&gt;

From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as [[Compaq]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[IBM Aptiva|IBM]], [[Packard Bell]], and [[AST Research]] struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out.&lt;ref name="ZDA"&gt;ZDNET Asia: [http://www.zdnetasia.com/michael-dell-back-as-ceo-rollins-resigns-61986298.htm Michael Dell back as CEO] February 1, 2007. Visited: April 10, 2012 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611213001/http://www.zdnetasia.com/michael-dell-back-as-ceo-rollins-resigns-61986298.htm|date=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones |first=Kathryn |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/02/01/335960/ |title=The Dell Way Michael Dell's famous business model made his company the world's premier computer maker. Now he's branching into new fields and taking on virtually every other hardware manufacturer. Can "the Model" stand the strain? – February 1, 2003 |publisher=CNN |date=February 1, 2003 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, when Compaq merged with [[Hewlett Packard]] (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="bw1103"/&gt;

Dell attained and maintained the top rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to ''Consumer Reports'', year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001 right before [[Windows XP]] was released.

In 1996, Dell began selling computers through its website.

In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran [[Microsoft Windows NT]] on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/updates/thompson12e/case/dell8.html |title=Dell Computer Corporation Online Case |publisher=Mhhe.com |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first [[business acquisition|acquisition]] occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, [[handhelds]], digital audio players, and [[Printer (computing)|printers]]. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO [[Kevin Rollins]]'s attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/06/13/michael-dells-dilemma/ |title=Michael Dell's dilemma – Fortune Tech |work=Fortune |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the company was rebranded as simply "Dell Inc." to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.&lt;ref name="Dell-Inc-May-2003-PRE-14A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1992/95013403007092/filing-main.htm |title=Dell Inc, Form PRE 14A, Filing Date May 5, 2003 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman,&lt;ref name="Dell-Inc-May-2004-DEF-14A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1422/95013404008188/filing-main.htm |title=Dell Inc, Form DEF 14A, Filing Date May 27, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001. Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

Under Rollins, Dell acquired [[Alienware]], a manufacturer of high-end PCs targeted mainly towards the [[PC game|gaming]] market.&lt;ref name="Dell-Inc-Mar-2006-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2598/115752306002942/filing-main.htm |title=Dell Inc, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 23, 2006 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappointments===
In 2005, while earnings and sales continued to rise, sales growth slowed considerably, and the company stock lost 25% of its value that year.&lt;ref name="BW0206"&gt;Bloomberg-Businessweek [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search Its Dell vs the Dell way], February 2006. Visited: April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2006, the stock traded around $25 USD which was 40% down from July 2005—the high-water mark of the company in the post-dotcom era.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Darlin |first=Damon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/15/technology/15dell.html |title=Falling Short of A+ |work=The New York Times |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Dell-revamps-product-group%2C-adds-executives/2100-11746_3-6143163.html |title=Dell revamps product group, adds executives – CNET News |publisher=CNET |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services, and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1014_3-6155185.html |title=Michael Dell back as CEO; Rollins resigns – CNET News |publisher=CNET |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.&lt;ref name="news.cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Haff |first=Gordon |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13556_3-10471396-61.html |title=The real Dell 2.0 &amp;#124; The Pervasive Data Center – CNET News |publisher=CNET |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers (a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory). As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins.&lt;ref name="ZDA"/&gt; The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores.[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-9829431-17.html]&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt; ''CNET'' has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Despite plans of expanding into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, as desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32 percent of its revenue, 85 percent of its revenue comes from businesses, and Sixty-four percent of its revenue comes from North and South America, according to its 2006 third-quarter results. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market which purchases PCs in upgrade cycles had largely decided to take a break from buying new systems. The last cycle started around 2002, three or so years after companies started buying PCs ahead of the perceived Y2K problems, and corporate clients were not expected to upgrade again until extensive testing of Microsoft's [[Windows Vista]] (expected in early 2007), putting the next upgrade cycle around 2008.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Dell-revamps-product-group%2C-adds-executives/2100-11746_3-6143163.html |title=Dell revamps product group, adds executives – CNET News |publisher=CNET |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Dells-dog-days-of-summer/2100-1014_3-6097185.html |title=Dell's dog days of summer – CNET News |publisher=CNET |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model. Consumers had become the main drivers of PC sales in recent years,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; yet there had a decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone, as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first. Dell's rivals in the PC industry, HP, Gateway and Acer, had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer shift.&lt;ref name="director1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://director.co.uk/MAGAZINE/2009/4%20April/Michael_Dell_62_9.html |title=Michael Dell &amp;#124; Dell |publisher=Director.co.uk |author=Woodward, David |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815101949/http://director.co.uk/MAGAZINE/2009/4%20April/Michael_Dell_62_9.html |archivedate=August 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel TVs and MP3 players.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Dell responded by experimenting with mall kiosks, plus quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an innovator.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="director1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dell had a risk-averse management style and he openly mocked rivals that spent on R&amp;D (research and development) and acquisitions, though by the late 2000s this may have contributed to Dell missing market shifts like mobile phones and tablet computers.[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-24/boeings-787-dreamliner-and-the-decline-of-innovation#p2]&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's low spending on R&amp;D relative to its revenue (compared to [[IBM]], [[Hewlett Packard]], and [[Apple Inc.]])—which worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and later mobile devices.&lt;ref name="BW0206"/&gt; Increasing spending on R&amp;D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.&lt;ref name="bw1103"/&gt; Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s, but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete IT solutions and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett Packard and Oracle.&lt;ref name="news.cnet.com"/&gt;

Dell's reputation for poor customer service, since 2002, which was exacerbated as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under increasing scrutiny on the Web. The original Dell model was known for high customer satisfaction when PCs sold for thousands but by the 2000s, the company could not justify that level of service when computers in the same lineup sold for hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverman |first=Dwight |url=http://blog.chron.com//techblog/2005/07/hey-dell-are-you-listening/ |title=Hey, Dell: Are you listening? – TechBlog |work=Houston Chronicle |date=July 3, 2005 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from the head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve on this and rolled out ''DellConnect'' to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/294370-dell-learns-to-listen?type=old_article |title=Dell Learns to Listen |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=October 17, 2007 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also criticism that Dell used faulty components for its PCs, particularly the 11.8 million OptiPlex desktop computers sold to businesses and governments from May 2003 to July 2005, that suffered from bad capacitors made by a company called Nichicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/technology/29dell.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ashlee | last=Vance | title=In Suit Over Faulty Computers, Window to Dell's Fall | date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A battery recall in August 2006, as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company though later, [[Sony]] was found responsible for the faulty batteries.&lt;ref name="ZDA"/&gt;

2006 marked the first year that Dell's growth was slower than the PC industry as a whole. By the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell lost its title of the largest PC manufacturer to rival Hewlett Packard whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated thanks to a restructuring initiated by their CEO [[Mark Hurd]].&lt;ref name="BW0206"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CRN.COM: [http://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/197002312/rollins-dells-outstanding-executive-is-now-out-of-a-job.htm;jsessionid=DKITbSt2WFcQT1hL4UqHMg**.ecappj02 Rollins now out of job]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/10/markets/spotlight/spotlight_dell/index.htm | publisher=CNN | first1=Amanda | last1=Cantrell | title=All's not well with Dell | date=February 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After four out of five quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as President and CEO on January 31, 2007, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.&lt;ref name="Dell-Inc-Feb-2007-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2259/0000950134-07-002027.pdf |title=Dell Inc, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Feb 5, 2007 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dell 2.0 and downsizing===
Dell announced a change campaign called "Dell 2.0," reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.&lt;ref name="director1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1014_3-6155185.html |title=Michael Dell back as CEO; Rollins resigns – CNET News |publisher=CNET |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Michael Dell announced a number of initiatives and plans (part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative) to improve the company's financial performance. These include elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "[[bureaucracy]]". Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by [[Donald Carty]], as the company came under an SEC probe for its accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Dell-CFO-stepping-down-in-January/2100-1003_3-6144950.html |title=Dell CFO stepping down in January – CNET News |publisher=CNET |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2008, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in [[Kanata, Ontario]], terminating approximately 1100 employees, with 500 of those redundancies effective on the spot, and with the official closure of the center scheduled for the summer. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the city of [[Ottawa]] won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high [[Canadian dollar]] that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Seggewiss, Krista  |author2=Hill, Bert| title = The Dell dream dies

The company had also announced the shutdown of its [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] office, losing 900 jobs.

By the late 2000s, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.&lt;ref name="statesman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statesman1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/technology/2009/10/08/1008Dell.html |title=Dell closing its last large U.S. plant |publisher=Austin American-Statesman |date=October 8, 2009 |author=Kirk Ladendorf |accessdate=November 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011102118/http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/technology/2009/10/08/1008Dell.html |archivedate=October 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell closed plants that produced desktop computers for the North American market, including the Mort Topfer Manufacturing Center in [[Austin, Texas]] (original location)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=95gt-95gt-95gt (1 comment ) |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1003_3-5428990.html |title=Inside Dell's manufacturing mecca – CNET News |publisher=CNET |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverman |first=Dwight |url=http://blog.chron.com/techblog/2008/04/one-time-showcase-for-dell-closing-in-austin/ |title=One-time showcase for Dell closing in Austin – TechBlog |work=Houston Chronicle |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009, respectively.

In the shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world. Dell and fellow American contemporary Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins.

Typical leveraged buyouts have been viewed as tools of [[vulture capitalist|vulture capitalists]]. Ordinarily, the buyer seeks to break up the firm and layoff workers or bring greater efficiency and new management to a troubled firm. The Dell leveraged buyout is unusual because the driving force behind the deal was not a vulture capitalist, but rather, Michael Dell, who was already the Chairman and CEO, founder, and largest shareholder of the firm. Unlike most leveraged buyouts that aim to wrest management control away from incumbents, the Dell deal intends to keep the same leadership team in place. The main aim of Dell's leveraged buyout is to rejigger the company’s financial structure.&lt;ref name=dodge/&gt;&lt;ref name=dodge&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/02/dell_goes_private_leveraged_buyout_will_help_dell_pay_investors_while_minimizing.html "Dell’s Gigantic Tax Dodge"] ''Slate'', February 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dodge/&gt;&lt;ref name=10k12&gt;[http://i.dell.com/sites/content/corporate/secure/en/Documents/FY12_Form10K.pdf "Dell, Inc.

''Associated Press'' via ''ABC News''.&lt;/ref&gt; The following August he reached a deal with the special committee on the board for $13.88 (a raised price of $13.75 plus a special dividend of 13 cents per share), as well as a change to the voting rules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/02/us-dell-buyout-vote-idUSBRE97106220130802 "Michael Dell closes in on prize with sweeter $25 billion deal"].

''WIRED''. September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and closed on October 30, 2013, ending Dell's 25-year run as a publicly traded company.

After the buyout, the newly private Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Programme that they expected to reduce their workforce by up to seven percent. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that Dell may be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2014/02/12/dell_vsp/ |title=Dell staffers head for exit armed with redundo cheques |last1=Kunert |first1=Paul |date=February 12, 2014 |work=channelregister.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Dell announced intentions to become a publicly-traded company again by paying $21.7 billion in both cash and stock to buy back shares from its stake in [[VMware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dell-vmware/dell-moves-to-go-public-spurns-ipo-idUSKBN1JS11X|title=Dell moves to go public, spurns IPO|last=Donnell|first=Carl|date=|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of EMC===
On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".&lt;ref name=bbc-dellemc&gt;{{cite news|title=Dell agrees $67bn EMC takeover|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-34505553|accessdate=12 October 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dell to Buy EMC in Deal Worth About $67 Billion|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-12/dell-to-acquire-emc-for-67-billion-to-add-data-storage-devices|website = Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 2015-10-12|first = Brian|last = Womack|first2 = Dina|last2 = Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement came two years after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business.&lt;ref name=WSJ-20130329&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | title = Dell Makes Case to Go Private in Grim Filing | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323501004578390692268605644 | date = March 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It's thought that the company's value has roughly doubled since then.&lt;ref name=WSJ-2015-10-12&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | author = David Benoit| title = Dell’s Value and the ‘Falling Knife’ | url = http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/10/12/dells-value-and-the-falling-knife/ | date = October 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EMC was being pressured by [[Elliott Management Corporation|Elliott Management]], a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize their unusual "Federation" structure, in which EMC's divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued&lt;ref name=BusinessWire-2014-10-08&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141008005668/en/Elliott-Management-Sends-Letter-Board-Directors-EMC# | title = Elliott Management Sends Letter to Board of Directors of EMC Corporation | publisher = [[Business Wire|BusinessWire]] | date = October 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core "EMC II" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3{{nbsp}}billion from personal computers and $8.9bn from servers, while EMC had $16.5bn from EMC II, $1bn from [[RSA Security]], $6bn from [[VMware]], and $230{{nbsp}}million from [[Pivotal Software]].&lt;ref name=WSJ-2015-10-13&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | title = EMC Takeover Marks Return of Michael Dell | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/dell-to-buy-emc-for-67-billion-1444649012 | date = October 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EMC owns around 80 percent of the stock of VMware.&lt;ref name=FT-Lex-2015-10-12&gt;{{cite news | title = Dell-EMC: The empty shop | newspaper = [[Financial Times]] | date = October 12, 2015 | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3/abfd601e-7102-11e5-ad6d-f4ed76f0900a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed acquisition will maintain VMware as a separate company, held via a new [[tracking stock]], while the other parts of EMC will be rolled into Dell.&lt;ref name=FT-2015-10-12&gt;{{cite news | title = Dell agrees $63bn acquisition of EMC | newspaper = [[Financial Times]] | date = October 12, 2015 | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/170fa5f2-708a-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the acquisition closes Dell will again publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-NWLBRI6K50YD01-7BPSHOJ09P7U1SQJVJQUC9CNAI | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | author = Brian Womack | date = October 21, 2015 | title = Dell CFO Reluctantly Accepts Public Disclosures With EMC Deal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
From its early beginnings, Dell operated as a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications. In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.&lt;ref&gt;Dedrick, J. and Kraemer, K. L. (March 2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120427221617/http://pcic.merage.uci.edu/papers/2007/MarketMaking.pdf "Market Making in the PC Industry"], Chapter 10, in Hamilton, Senauer and Petrovic (eds) ''The Market Makers: How Retailers are Reshaping the Global Economy''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0199655871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To minimize the delay between purchase and delivery, Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers. This also allows for implementing a [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] (JIT) manufacturing approach, which minimizes [[inventory]] costs. Low inventory is another signature of the Dell business model—a critical consideration in an industry where components depreciate very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, K. L. and Dedrick, J. (2002) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120427221617/http://crito.uci.edu/papers/2002/dell.pdf "Dell Computer: Organization of a Global Production Network"], Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell's manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, functional testing (including "burn-in"), and quality control. Throughout most of the company's history, Dell manufactured desktop machines in-house and contracted out manufacturing of base notebooks for configuration in-house.&lt;ref&gt;Company Annual Reports, various years.&lt;/ref&gt; The company's approach has changed, as cited in the 2006 Annual Report, which states, "We are continuing to expand our use of original design manufacturing partnerships and manufacturing outsourcing relationships." ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported in September 2008 that "Dell has approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell" their plants.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, J: "Dell Plans to Sell Factories in Effort to Cut Costs", ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 2000s, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.&lt;ref name="statesman1"/&gt;

Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell plants in [[Austin, Texas]] (original location) and [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] (opened in 1999), which have been closed in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The plant in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] received $280 million USD in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010, and Dell's contract with the state requires them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions.&lt;ref name="theregister.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bizjournals.com"/&gt;  Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The [[Miami, Florida]] facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref name="statesman1"/&gt;

Dell assembled computers for the [[Europe, the Middle East, and Africa|EMEA]] market at the [[Limerick]] facility in the Republic of Ireland, and once employed about 4,500 people in that country. Dell began manufacturing in Limerick in 1991 and went on to become Ireland's largest exporter of goods and its second-largest company and foreign investor. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to Dell's new plant in the Polish city of [[Łódź]] by January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116235908/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0108/Dell.html 1,900 jobs lost at Dell in Limerick].

==Security==

===Self-signed root certificate===
In November 2015 it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed [[root certificate]] known as "eDellRoot".&lt;ref name=ars-selfsigned&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell does a Superfish, ships PCs with easily cloneable root certificates|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/11/dell-does-superfish-ships-pcs-with-self-signed-root-certificates/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating [[HTTPS]]-protected websites such as [[Google]] and [[Bank of America]] and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.&lt;ref name=ars-selfsigned /&gt; Dell apologised and offered a removal tool.&lt;ref name=ars-removal&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell apologizes for HTTPS certificate fiasco, provides removal tool|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/11/dell-apologizes-for-https-certificate-fiasco-provides-removal-tool/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dell Foundation Services===
Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program.&lt;ref name=ars-dfs&gt;{{cite web|title=PCs running Dell support app can be uniquely ID’d by snoops and scammers|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/11/pcs-running-dell-support-app-can-be-uniquely-idd-by-snoops-and-scammers/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was possible even if a customer enabled [[private browsing]] and deleted their [[browser cookie]]s.&lt;ref name=ars-dfs /&gt; ''[[Ars Technica]]'' recommended that Dell customers uninstall the program until the issue was addressed.&lt;ref name=ars-dfs /&gt;

==Commercial aspects==

===Organization===
The board consists of nine directors. Michael Dell, the founder of the company, serves as chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Other board members include [[Donald J. Carty|Don Carty]], [[Judy Lewent]], [[Klaus Luft]], [[Alex J. Mandl|Alex Mandl]], and [[Sam Nunn]]. [[Shareholder]]s elect the nine board members at meetings, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a resignation to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees having oversight over specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles financial matters such as proposed mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters (including nomination of the board); and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating [[antitrust]] laws. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Day-to-day operations of the company are run by the Global Executive Management Committee, which sets [[Strategic management|strategic direction]]. Dell has regional senior vice-presidents for countries other than the United States, including David Marmonti for [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] and Stephen J. Felice for Asia/Japan. {{As of|2007}}, other officers included Martin Garvin (senior vice president for worldwide procurement) and [[Susan Sheskey]] (vice president and [[Chief Information Officer]]). {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Marketing===
Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, [[Mail-order catalog|catalogs]] and newspapers. Some of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell cut its prices in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. This also cut profit margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the Internet and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to India and [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105132801/http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_20_ndi_000?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp Michael Dell Sees India Playing a Key Role in the Online World]. Dell, New Dehli, India, March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor [[Ben Curtis (actor)|Ben Curtis]] playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!"&lt;ref name=SlateDell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Rob|title=The Mystery of the Dell Dude|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/ad_report_card/2002/06/the_mystery_of_the_dell_dude.html|website=slate.com|publisher=Slate Magazine|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent advertising campaign featured [[intern]]s at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).

In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from [[BBDO]] to [[Working Mother]] Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from the [[The Flaming Lips|Flaming Lips]] and [[Devo]] who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan "Yours is here" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.&lt;ref name="engadget"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/11/21/dell-launches-star-studded-yours-is-here-ad-campaign/|title=Dell launches star-studded "Yours Is Here" ad campaign|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled "Dell World".  The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners.  In 2011, the event was held October 12–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell World 2011 |publisher=Dell |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |url=http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/corp-comm/pk-dellworld-2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124094728/http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/corp-comm/pk-dellworld-2011 |archivedate=November 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the event was held December 11–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell World 2012 Press Kit |publisher=Dell |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |url=http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/secure/2012-dell-world-press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517115347/http://www.dell.com/Learn/us/en/uscorp1/secure/2012-dell-world-press |archivedate=May 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the event was held December 11–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell World 2013 |publisher=Dell |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |url=https://dellworld2013.activeevents.com/portal/newreg.ww |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217050630/https://dellworld2013.activeevents.com/portal/newreg.ww |archivedate=December 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the event was held November 4–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/blog/techflash/2014/09/dell-world-speaker-schedule-without-star-keynote.html|title=Dell World speaker schedule without star keynote; panel to open show |website=bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the event was held October 20–23.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/event/dell-world-2015-20151020|title=Dell World 2015 - 2015-10-20 {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dell partner program====
In late 2007, Dell Inc. announced that it planned to expand its program to [[value-added reseller]]s (VARs), giving it the official name of "Dell Partner Direct" and a new Website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Partner Direct | publisher=Dell  | accessdate =June 13, 2011 | url = http://partner.Dell.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell India has started Online Ecommerce website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-03/news/39714982_1_dell-india-consumer-products-vostro | work=The Times of India | title=Dell enables online purchases through DESA platform | date=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its Dell Partner www.compuindia.com GNG Electronics Pvt Ltd&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/info-tech/dell-launches-online-estore-dell-express-ship-affiliate/article4777976.ece "Dell launches online e-store Dell Express Ship Affiliate"]. ''The Hindu''. June 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; termed as Dell Express Ship Affiliate(DESA).
The main objective was to reduce the delivery time. Customers who visit Dell India official site are given the option to buy online which then will be redirected to Dell affiliate website compuindia.com.&lt;ref name="tech.fortune.cnn.com"/&gt;

====Global analytics====
Dell also operates a captive analytics division which supports pricing, web analytics, and supply chain operations. DGA operates as a single, centralized entity with a global view of Dell's business activities. The firm supports over 500 internal customers worldwide and has created a quantified impact of over $500 million.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

====Criticisms of marketing of laptop security====
In 2008, Dell received press coverage over its claim of having the world's most secure laptops, specifically, its Latitude D630 and Latitude D830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2220173/dell-scolded-laptop-ads |title=Dell Scolded for Laptop Ads |publisher=Vnunet.com |author=Nichols, Shaun |date=June 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023034729/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2220173/dell-scolded-laptop-ads |archivedate=October 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Lenovo's request, the (U.S.) National Advertising Division (NAD) evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20080623/dont-worry-Dell-your-laptops-are-still-the-worlds-ugliest/ |title=Dell's Claim as World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops? |publisher=Digitaldaily.allthingsd.com |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail===
Dell first opened their retail stores in India.&lt;ref name="tech.fortune.cnn.com"/&gt;

====United States====
In the early 1990s, Dell sold its products through [[Best Buy]], [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]] stores in the United States. Dell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit margins on the business, exclusively distributing through a direct-sales model for the next decade. In 2003, Dell briefly sold products in [[Sears]] stores in the U.S. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the U.S. once again, starting with [[Sam's Club]] and [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]. [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], the largest office-supply retailer in the U.S., and [[Best Buy]], the largest electronics retailer in the U.S., became Dell retail partners later that same year.

=====Kiosks=====
Starting in 2002, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company. Starting in 2005, Dell expanded [[kiosk]] locations to include shopping malls across Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong. On January 30, 2008, Dell announced it would shut down all 140 kiosks in the U.S. due to expansion into retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/press-releases/2008-01-30-00-direct-retail.aspx |title=Dell Focuses on Direct and Retail Business, Closes Kiosks in U.S |publisher=Content.dell.com |date=January 30, 2008 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113024054/http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/press-releases/2008-01-30-00-direct-retail.aspx |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 3, 2010, Dell had also shut down all of its mall kiosks in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/04/dell-closing-down-their-retail-kiosks-across-the-country/|title=Dell Closing Down Their Retail Kiosks Across The Country  |publisher=gizmodo.com |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====NorthPark Service Center=====
In 2006, Dell Inc. opened one full store, {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} in area, at [[NorthPark Center]] in [[Dallas]], Texas. It operates the retail outlet seven days a week to display about 36 models, including PCs and televisions. As at the kiosks, customers can only see demonstration-computers and place orders through agents. Dell then delivers purchased items just as if the customer had placed the order by phone or over the Internet.

In addition to showcasing products, the stores also support on-site warranties and non-warranty service ("Dell Solution Station"). Services offered include repairing computer video-cards and removing spyware from hard drives.

On February 14, 2008, Dell closed the Service Center in its Dallas NorthPark store and laid off all the technical staff there.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Retail stores====
{{As of|2008|2|alt=As of the end of February 2008}}, Dell products shipped to one of the largest office-supply retailers in Canada, [[Staples Business Depot]]. In April 2008, [[Future Shop]] and [[Best Buy]] began carrying a subset of Dell products, such as certain desktops, laptops, printers, and monitors.

Since some shoppers in certain markets show reluctance to purchase technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some countries in Central Europe and Russia. In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in [[Budapest]]. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.

In the UK, [[HMV]]'s flagship [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero]] store has sold Dell XPS PCs since December 2007. From January 2008 the UK stores of [[DSG International (retailer)|DSGi]] have sold Dell products (in particular, through [[Currys]] and [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]] stores). As of 2008, the large supermarket-chain [[Tesco]] has sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.

In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, [[Officeworks]] (part of [[Coles Group]]), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range. These models have slightly different model numbers, but almost replicate the ones available from the Dell Store. Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with [[Harris Technology]] (another part of Coles Group) in November of the same year. In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with the discount electrical retailer, [[The Good Guys (Australasia)|The Good Guys]], known for "Slashing Prices". Dell agreed to distribute a variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including [[Studio]] and [[Dell XPS|XPS]] systems in late 2008. Dell and [[Dick Smith Electronics]] (owned by [[Woolworths Limited]]) reached an agreement to expand within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand in May 2009 (1 year since Officeworks&amp;nbsp;— owned by Coles Group&amp;nbsp;— reached a deal). The retailer has agreed to distribute a variety of [[Inspiron]] and [[Studio]] notebooks, with minimal Studio desktops from the Dell range. {{As of|2009}}, Dell continues to run and operate its various kiosks in 18 shopping centres throughout Australia. On March 31, 2010, Dell announced to Australian Kiosk employees that they were shutting down the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.

In Germany, Dell is selling selected smartphones and notebooks via [[Media Markt]] and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87864-discounter-check-dell-venue-pro-media-markt.html |title=Dell Venue Pro offered by Media Markt |publisher=Netzwelt.de |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
Dell's major competitors include [[Hewlett-Packard Company|Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), [[Hasee]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Toshiba]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Sony]], [[Asus]], [[Lenovo Group|Lenovo]], IBM, [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Panasonic]] with its [[Toughbook]] series, [[Samsung]] and Apple. Dell and its subsidiary, Alienware, compete in the enthusiast market against [[AVADirect]], [[Falcon Northwest]], [[VoodooPC]] (a subsidiary of HP), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006, Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal computer market, compared to HP with roughly 15%.

{{As of|2006|alt=In late 2006}}, Dell lost its lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard. Both [[Gartner]] and [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped more units&lt;ref&gt;Kirdahy, Matthew (October 19, 2006)  [https://www.forbes.com/2006/10/19/dell-computer-earnings-markets-equity-cx_mk_1019markets07.html]. Forbes.&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide than Dell did. Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period. The problem got worse in the fourth quarter, when Gartner estimated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070117006106&amp;newsLang=en |title=Gartner Says Hewlett-Packard Takes Clear Lead in Fourth Quarter Worldwide PC Shipments and Creates a Virtual Tie with Dell for 2006 Year-End Results |publisher=Business Wire |date=January 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721195555/http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070117006106&amp;newsLang=en |archive-date=July 21, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP's 23.9% growth). As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%).

IDC reported that Dell lost more server market share than any of the top four competitors in that arena. IDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year. This represents an 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors [[EMC Corporation|EMC]] and IBM.

===Partnership with EMC===
In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as [[fibre channel]] and [[iSCSI]] [[storage area network]]s. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.emc.com/about/news/press/us/2001/20011022-1125.htm | title=Dell, EMC Sign Multi-Billion-Dollar Enterprise Storage Agreement | publisher=[[Dell EMC]] | date=October 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product lineup by adding the EMC [[Celerra]] NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of [[data deduplication]] products as part of its TierDisk family of [[data storage device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.emc.com/about/news/press/2008/20081209-01.htm |title=Dell, EMC Extend and Expand Strategic Alliance | publisher=[[Dell EMC]] | date=December 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Dell, EMC End Storage Reseller Partnership Two Years Early | url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Data-Storage/Dell-EMC-End-Storage-Reseller-Partnership-Two-Years-Early-705362/ | work=EWeek | date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Dell ends 10-year reseller relationship with EMC | url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2499048/data-center/dell-ends-10-year-reseller-relationship-with-emc.html | first=Lucas | last=Mearian | work=[[ComputerWorld]] | date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental record==
Dell committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its global activities by 40% by 2015, with the 2008 fiscal year as the baseline year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/corp-comm/cr-earth-emissions.aspx |title=Walking the Walk on Greenhouse Gas Reduction |publisher=Dell|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is listed in [[Greenpeace]]’s Guide to Greener Electronics that scores leading electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, [[climate and energy]] and how green their products are. In November 2011, Dell ranked 2nd out of 15 listed electronics makers (increasing its score to 5.1 from 4.9, which it gained in the previous ranking from October 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112022636/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |archivedate=November 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell was the first company to publicly state a timeline for the elimination of toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which it planned to phase out by the end of 2009. It revised this commitment and now aims to remove toxics by the end of 2011 but only in its computing products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/toxics/2010/version16/Ranking%20tables%20Oct%202010-Dell.pdf|title=Ranking tables – October 2010|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell's aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_06_05_lon_000?c=us&amp;l=en |title=Dell Sets Goal Of Becoming Greenest Technology Company|publisher=Dell|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was ‘hypocritical’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/dell-breaking-promise-290310/ |title=Dell targeted for breaking promise on toxic chemicals|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dell has launched its first products completely free of PVC and BFRs with the G-Series monitors (G2210 and G2410) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/corp-comm/earth-greener-products-materials.aspx |title=Materials Use: What's Inside Our Products – And What's Not|publisher=Dell|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2012 report on progress relating to [[conflict minerals]], the [[Enough Project]] rated Dell the eighth highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.&lt;ref name='EnoughProject2012'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.enoughproject.org/files/CorporateRankings2012.pdf | title = Taking Conflict Out of Consumer Gadgets: Company Rankings on Conflict Minerals 2012 | accessdate = August 17, 2012 | last = Lezhnev | first = Sasha |author2=Alex Hellmuth | date = Aug 2012 | format = PDF | publisher = [[Enough Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green initiatives===
Dell became the first company in the [[information technology industry]] to establish a product-[[recycling]] goal (in 2004) and completed the implementation of its global consumer recycling-program in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1421.html|title=Dell First US Computer Company to Commit to a Global Recycling Goal|author=William Baue|publisher=SocialFunds}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.&lt;ref name="National Recycling Coalition"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100308223409/http://www.nrc-recycle.org/recyclingworkswinners.aspx Winners of NRC's "Recycling Works" Award]. National Recycling Coalition&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.&lt;ref name="Dell Inc."&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116172136/http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/press-releases/2007-07-19-01-recycle.aspx Dell Ahead of Schedule to Achieve Multi-Year Product Recycling Goal]. Dell. July 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company on Earth for the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070605005323/en/Dell-Sets-Goal-Greenest-Technology-Company|title=Dell Sets Goal of Becoming Greenest Technology Company|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company launched a [[zero-carbon]] initiative that includes:
# reducing Dell's [[carbon intensity]] by 15 percent by 2012
# requiring primary suppliers to report carbon emissions data during quarterly business reviews
# partnering with customers to build the "greenest PC on the planet"
# expanding the company's carbon-offsetting program, "Plant a Tree for Me"

The company introduced the term "[[The Re-Generation]]" during a [[round table]] in London commemorating 2007 [[World Environment Day]]. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also talked about plans to take the lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry and maintaining that leadership in the future.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR) Report that follows the [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI) protocol. Dell's 2008 CSR report ranked as "Application Level B" as "checked by GRI".&lt;ref&gt;Dell 2008 Corporate Social Responsibility Report: [http://i.Dell.com/sites/content/corporate/environment/en/Documents/Dell%20Corporate%20Responsibility%20Report%202008.pdf Section "GRI Performance Indicators Index"], Dell Inc, 2008. Retrieved October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The company aims to reduce its external environmental impact through an energy-efficient evolution of products, and also reduce its direct operational impact through energy-efficiency programs. Internal energy-efficiency programs reportedly save the company more than $3&amp;nbsp;million annually in energy-cost savings. The largest component of the company's internal energy-efficiency savings comes through [[PC power management]]: the company expects to save $1.8&amp;nbsp;million in energy costs through using specialized energy-management software on a network of 50,000 PCs.

In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily [[ATX]] [[motherboard]]s and [[Computer power supply|PSU]] to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=339053 |title=Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design &gt; Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design |publisher=InformIT |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Scott (2002).

In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honour a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than the usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honour the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) a customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1&amp;nbsp;million (US$31250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2010/06/07/2003474881 Dell loses Taiwan consumer lawsuit: report], June 7, 2010.

'''Differential Global Positioning Systems''' ('''DGPS''') are enhancements to the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) which provide improved location accuracy, in the range of operations of each system, from the 15-meter nominal GPS accuracy to about 10 cm in case of the best implementations.

Each DGPS uses a network of fixed ground-based reference stations to broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the [[GPS satellite]] system and known fixed positions. These stations broadcast the difference between the measured satellite [[pseudorange]]s and actual (internally computed) pseudoranges, and receiver stations may correct their pseudoranges by the same amount. The digital correction signal is typically broadcast locally over ground-based transmitters of shorter range.

The [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG) and the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] (CCG) each run DGPS systems in the United States and Canada on [[longwave]] radio frequencies between 285&amp;nbsp;kHz and 325&amp;nbsp;kHz near major waterways and harbors. The USCG's DGPS system was named NDGPS (Nationwide DGPS) and was jointly administered by the Coast Guard and the U.S. Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). It consisted of broadcast sites located throughout the inland and coastal portions of the United States including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/augmentations/ |title=US Government page on GPS augmentation systems |publisher=Gps.gov |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries have their own DGPS system.

A similar system which transmits corrections from orbiting satellites instead of ground-based transmitters is called a Wide-Area DGPS (WADGPS)&lt;ref&gt; Kee, C., Parkinson, B. W., and Axelrad, P. (1991), "Wide area differential GPS", Navigation, Journal of the Institute of Navigation, 38, 2 (Summer, 1991), &lt;https://www.ion.org/publications/abstract.cfm?articleID=100207&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Satellite Based Augmentation System]].

==History==
When GPS was first being put into service, the US military was concerned about the possibility of enemy forces using the globally available GPS signals to guide their own weapon systems. Originally, the government thought the "coarse acquisition" (C/A) signal would give only about 100-meter accuracy, but with improved receiver designs, the actual accuracy was 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=McNamara |first=Joel |title=GPS for Dummies |edition=2nd |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9hTSVscLI7QC&amp;pg=PT60&amp;lpg=PT60&amp;dq=gulf+war+commercial+GPS+%22selective+availability%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=htk9aPKTnS&amp;sig=cwS6-iprwWYs-nNYCYrsxIfRzls&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-tJDT_rpOKfXiQKGk-z0Cg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=gulf%20war%20commercial%20GPS%20%22selective%20availability%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-470-15623-0 }}&lt;!-- no page number --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in March 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Ho |first1=Angela |last2=Mozdzanowski |first2=Alex |last3=Ng |first3=Christine |title=GPS Case |year=2005 |url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/institute-for-data-systems-and-society/ids-900-integrating-doctoral-seminar-on-emerging-technologies-fall-2005/lecture-notes/lec6_gps.pdf |publisher=MIT |series=Open Courseware }}, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid providing such unexpected accuracy, the C/A signal transmitted on the L1 frequency (1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz) was deliberately degraded by offsetting its clock signal by a random amount, equivalent to about 100 meters of distance. This technique, known as "[[Selective Availability]]", or SA for short, seriously degraded the usefulness of the GPS signal for non-military users. More accurate guidance was possible for users of dual-frequency GPS receivers which also received the L2 frequency (1227.6&amp;nbsp;MHz), but the L2 transmission, intended for military use, was encrypted and was available only to authorized users with the decryption keys.

This presented a problem for civilian users who relied upon ground-based [[radio navigation]] systems such as [[LORAN]], [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] and [[non-directional beacon|NDB]] systems costing millions of dollars each year to maintain. The advent of a [[global navigation satellite system]] (GNSS) could provide greatly improved accuracy and performance at a fraction of the cost. The accuracy inherent in the S/A signal was however too poor to make this realistic. The military received multiple requests from the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]], [[United States Coast Guard|United States Coast Guard (USCG)]] and [[United States Department of Transportation|United States Department of Transportation (DOT)]] to set S/A aside to enable civilian use of GNSS, but remained steadfast in its objection on grounds of security.

Through the early to mid 1980s, a number of agencies developed a solution to the SA "problem".{{dubious|date=February 2012}}&lt;!-- if SA turned on in 1990, why was there DGPS development in early 1980s? Surveying was suggested. Coast Guard lead agency for civilian use in 1989. --&gt; Since the SA signal was changed slowly, the effect of its offset on positioning was relatively fixed – that is, if the offset was "100 meters to the east", that offset would be true over a relatively wide area. This suggested that broadcasting this offset to local GPS receivers could eliminate the effects of SA, resulting in measurements closer to GPS's theoretical performance, around 15 meters. Additionally, another major source of errors in a GPS fix is due to transmission delays in the [[ionosphere]], which could also be measured and corrected for in the broadcast. This offered an improvement to about 5 meters accuracy, more than enough for most civilian needs.{{ref|FAA_FS}}

The US Coast Guard was one of the more aggressive proponents of the DGPS system, experimenting with the system on an ever-wider basis through the late 1980s and early 1990s. These signals are broadcast on marine [[longwave]] frequencies, which could be received on existing [[radiotelephone]]s and fed into suitably equipped GPS receivers. Almost all major GPS vendors offered units with DGPS inputs, not only for the USCG signals, but also aviation units on either [[VHF]] or commercial [[AM radio]] bands.

They started sending out "production quality" DGPS signals on a limited basis in 1996, and rapidly expanded the network to cover most US ports of call, as well as the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in partnership with the [[Canadian Coast Guard]]. Plans were put into place to expand the system across the US, but this would not be easy. The quality of the DGPS corrections generally fell with distance, and large transmitters capable of covering large areas tend to cluster near cities. This meant that lower-population areas, notably in the midwest and Alaska, would have little coverage by ground-based GPS. As of November 2013 the USCG's national DGPS system consisted of 85 broadcast sites which provide dual coverage to almost the entire US coastline and inland navigable waterways including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. In addition the system provided single or dual coverage to a majority of the inland portion of United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/images/Plots/web_coverage.jpg |title=USCG DGPS coverage plot via USCG Navigation Center |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the FAA (and others) started studying broadcasting the signals across the entire hemisphere from communications satellites in geostationary orbit. This led to the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) and similar systems, although these are generally not referred to as DGPS, or alternatively, "wide-area DGPS". WAAS offers accuracy similar to the USCG's ground-based DGPS networks, and there has been some argument that the latter will be turned off as WAAS becomes fully operational.

By the mid-1990s it was clear that the SA system was no longer useful in its intended role. DGPS would render it ineffective over the US, precisely where it was considered most needed. Additionally, experience during the [[Gulf War]] demonstrated that the widespread use of civilian receivers by U.S. forces meant that leaving SA turned on was thought to harm the U.S. more than if it were turned off.&lt;ref&gt;GPS for Dummies, stating that there weren't enough military GPS receivers, so "Selective Availability was temporarily turned off in 1990 during the Persian Gulf War" so that Coalition troops could use civilian GPS receivers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} After many years of pressure, it took an [[executive order (United States)|executive order]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] to get SA turned off permanently in 2000.&lt;ref name="OSTP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/statement.html|publisher=[[Office of Science and Technology Policy]]|title=Statement by the President regarding the United States' Decision to Stop Degrading Global Positioning System Accuracy|date=May 1, 2000|accessdate=2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, by this point DGPS had evolved into a system for providing more accuracy than even a non-SA GPS signal could provide on its own. There are several other sources of error which share the same characteristics as SA in that they are the same over large areas and for "reasonable" amounts of time. These include the ionospheric effects mentioned earlier, as well as errors in the satellite position ephemeris data and [[clock drift]] on the satellites. Depending on the amount of data being sent in the DGPS correction signal, correcting for these effects can reduce the error significantly, the best implementations offering accuracies of under 10&amp;nbsp;cm.

In addition to continued deployments of the USCG and FAA sponsored systems, a number of vendors have created commercial DGPS services, selling their signal (or receivers for it) to users who require better accuracy than the nominal 15 meters GPS offers. Almost all commercial GPS units, even hand-held units, now offer DGPS data inputs, and many also support WAAS directly. To some degree, a form of DGPS is now a natural part of most GPS operations.

==Operation==
[[File:DGPS Reference Station.jpg|thumb|upright|DGPS Reference Station ([[choke ring antenna]])]]
A reference station calculates differential corrections for its own location and time. Users may be up to 200 nautical miles (370&amp;nbsp;km) from the station, however, and some of the compensated errors vary with space: specifically, satellite [[ephemeris]] errors and those introduced by [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] and [[troposphere|tropospheric]] distortions. For this reason, the accuracy of DGPS decreases with distance from the reference station. The problem can be aggravated if the user and the station lack "inter visibility"—when they are unable to see the same satellites.

==Accuracy==
The United States ''Federal Radionavigation Plan'' and the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities|IALA]] ''Recommendation on the Performance and Monitoring of DGNSS Services in the Band 283.5–325&amp;nbsp;kHz'' cite the [[United States Department of Transportation]]'s 1993 estimated error growth of 0.67&amp;nbsp;m per 100&amp;nbsp;km from the broadcast site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Variations==
DGPS can refer to any type of Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS). There are many operational systems in use throughout the world, according to the US Coast Guard, 47 countries operate systems similar to the US NDGPS (Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System).

===European DGPS Network===
European DGPS network has been developed mainly by the Finnish and Swedish maritime administrations in order to improve safety in the archipelago between the two countries.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In the UK and Ireland, the system was implemented as a maritime navigation aid to fill the gap left by the demise of the [[Decca Navigator System]] in 2000. With a network of 12 transmitters sited around the coastline and three control stations, it was set up in 1998 by the countries' respective General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA)&amp;nbsp;— [[Trinity House]] covering [[England]], [[Wales]] and the [[Channel Islands]], the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] covering [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]], covering the whole of [[Ireland]]. Transmitting on the 300-kHz band, the system underwent testing and two additional transmitters were added before the system was declared operational in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;

===United States NDGPS===
The [[United States Department of Transportation]], in conjunction with the [[Federal Highway Administration]], the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] and the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|National Geodetic Survey]] appointed the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] as the maintaining agency for the U.S. Nationwide DGPS network (NDGPS). The system is an expansion of the previous Maritime Differential GPS (MDGPS), which the Coast Guard began in the late 1980s and completed in March 1999. MDGPS covered only coastal waters, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi River inland waterways, while NDGPS expands this to include complete coverage of the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/frp/frp2005/2005%20FRP%20WEB.pdf |title=2005 FEDERAL RADIONAVIGATION PLAN|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centralized Command and Control unit is the [http://www.navcen.uscg.gov USCG Navigation Center], based in Alexandria, VA.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 85 NDGPS sites in the US network, administered by the [http://navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=dgpsMain U.S. Department of Homeland Security Navigation Center].

In 2015, the USCG  and USACE sought comments on a planned phasing-out of the U.S. DGPS system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/08/18/2015-20401/nationwide-differential-global-positioning-system-ndgps|title=Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS)|date=2015-08-18|work=Federal Register|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In response to the comments received, a subsequent 2016 Federal Register notice announced that 46 stations would remain in service and "available to users in the maritime and coastal regions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/05/2016-15886/nationwide-differential-global-positioning-system-ndgps|title=Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS)|date=2016-07-05|work=Federal Register|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In spite of this decision, USACE decommissioned its remaining 7 sites and, in March 2018, the USCG announced that it would decommission its remaining stations by 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/21/2018-05684/discontinuance-of-the-nationwide-differential-global-positioning-system-ndgps|title=Discontinuance of the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS)|date=2018-03-21|work=Federal Register|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Canadian DGPS===
The Canadian system is similar to the US system and is primarily for maritime usage covering the Atlantic and Pacific coast as well as the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].
&lt;!--==Future== (Needs to be cleaned up and uncommented)
The NDGPS system is currently being expanded to cover the entire United States. DGPS and other systems worldwide will probably remain in operation as long as the GPS system requires ground-based augmentation.
--&gt;

===Australia===
Australia runs three DGPS systems: one is mainly for marine navigation, broadcasting its signal on the long-wave band;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.amsa.gov.au/navigation/services/dgps/ |title=AMSA's DGPS Service - Status |publisher=Australian Maritime Safety Authority|date= |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; another is used for land surveys and land navigation, and has corrections broadcast on the Commercial FM radio band. The third at Sydney airport is currently undergoing testing for precision landing of aircraft (2011), as a backup to the [[Instrument Landing System]] at least until 2015. It is called the [[Ground Based Augmentation System]]. Corrections to aircraft position are broadcast via the aviation VHF band.

==Post processing==

Post-processing is used in Differential GPS to obtain precise positions of unknown points by relating them to known points such as [[survey marker]]s.

The [[GPS]] measurements are usually stored in [[computer memory]] in the GPS receivers, and are subsequently transferred to a computer running the GPS post-processing software. The software computes [[baseline (surveying)|baseline]]s using simultaneous measurement data from two or more GPS receivers.

The baselines represent a three-dimensional line drawn between the two points occupied by each pair of GPS antennas. The post-processed measurements allow more precise positioning, because most GPS errors affect each receiver nearly equally, and therefore can be cancelled out in the calculations.

Differential GPS measurements can also be computed in real time by some GPS receivers if they receive a correction signal using a separate radio receiver, for example in [[Real Time Kinematic]] (RTK) [[surveying]] or [[navigation]].

The improvement of GPS positioning doesn't require simultaneous measurements of two or more receivers in any case, but can also be done by special use of a ''single'' device. In the 1990s when even handheld receivers were quite expensive, some methods of '''quasi-differential''' GPS were developed, using the receiver by quick turns of positions or loops of 3-10 [[Benchmark (surveying)|survey points]].

'''Ericus Gerhardus Verkade''' (20 November 1835 – 8 February 1907) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[businessman]] and the founder of the [[Verkade]] manufacturing company in 1886. 

== Biography ==
Ericus Gerhardus Verkade was born on 20 November 1835 in [[Vlaardingen]] in the [[Netherlands]]. He was named after his father, the [[Civil law notary|notary]] Ericus Gerhardus Verkade Sr (1801-1835), who died one month before he was born. Verkade's mother, Geertruida van Gelder, was from [[Wormerveer]] and moved her family back to her birthplace shortly after Ericus Jr's birth.&lt;ref name="gen"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://koning.mijnthuis.net/verkade.htm Verkade genealogy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after school, Verkade started a vegetable oil factory, which burned out in 1875. The next eight years he and his brother-in-law traded in grains. On May 2, 1886, he started a steam-powered bakery, which company he first named "De Ruyter" for the first mill in [[Zaandam]] that milled [[flour]]--the original "ruiter" ("chevalier") was on the company logo until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/1994/02/22/2633623/_Paplepeligheid__Verkade_geen_probleem.html|title='Paplepeligheid' Verkade geen probleem|last=Lakerveld|first=Peter van|date=22 February 1994|work=[[Trouw]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verkade originally baked [[bread]] and [[rusk]], but soon expanded to make cookies, chocolate, and snacks.&lt;ref name="trouw"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2008/07/02/2098128/Co_Verkade_1906-2008.html|title=Co Verkade 1906-2008|last=Hageman|first=Esther|date=2 July 2008|work=[[Trouw]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verkade became a household name in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrc.nl/necrologieen/2008/article1933665.ece/Jacobus_Verkade_1906-2008|title= Jacobus Verkade (1906-2008): Pionier in marketing koekjes en chocola |last=Voormolen|first=Sander|date=27 June 2008|work=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evmi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.evmi.nl/nieuws/mensen-bedrijven/5748/%27co%27-verkade-102-overleden.html|title='Co' Verkade (102) overleden|last=Meer|first=Tom van der|date=27 June 2008|publisher=EVMI|language=Dutch|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 in Zaandam, Verkade married Trijntje Smit (1835-1863) in 1857, with whom he had a daughter. In 1865 he married Eduarda Thalia Koning (1841-1917), with whom he had 7 children. His son [[Jan Verkade]] (1868-1948) became a well-known Post-Impressionist artist. Jan was the twin brother of Ericus Gerhardus (1868-1927) who would take over his father's business.&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt;

Verkade died on 8 February 1907 in [[Hilversum]] in the Netherlands.

{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}
'''Ground truth''' is a term used in various fields to refer to information provided by direct observation (i.e. [[empirical evidence]]) as opposed to information provided by [[inference]]. 

== Statistics and machine learning ==
In [[machine learning]], the term "ground truth" refers to the accuracy of the [[training set]]'s classification for [[supervised learning]] techniques.  This is used in [[statistical model]]s to prove or disprove [[research]] [[hypothesis|hypotheses]].  The term "ground truthing" refers to the process of gathering the proper [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] (provable) data for this test.  Compare with [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]].

[[Bayesian spam filtering]] is a common example of supervised learning.  In this system, the algorithm is manually taught the differences between spam and non-spam.  This depends on the ''ground truth'' of the messages used to train the algorithm &amp;ndash; inaccuracies in the ground truth will correlate to inaccuracies in the resulting spam/non-spam verdicts.

== Remote sensing ==
In [[remote sensing]], "ground truth" refers to information collected on location. Ground truth allows image data to be related to real features and materials on the ground. The collection of ground-truth data enables calibration of remote-sensing data, and aids in the interpretation and analysis of what is being sensed.  Examples include [[cartography]], [[meteorology]], analysis of [[aerial photography|aerial photographs]], [[satellite imagery]] and other techniques in which data are gathered at a distance.

More specifically, ground truth may refer to a process in which a "[[pixel]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=P|title=The Pixel: A Snare and a Delusion|journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing|date=1997|volume=18|issue=15|pages=679-685|doi=10.1080/014311697219015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[satellite]] image is compared to what is there in reality (at the present time) in order to verify the contents of the "pixel" on the image (noting that the concept of a "pixel" is somewhat ill-defined). In the case of a classified image, it allows supervised classification to help determine the accuracy of the classification performed by the remote sensing software and therefore minimize errors in the classification such as errors of commission and errors of omission.

Ground truth is usually done on site, performing surface observations and measurements of various properties of the features of the ground resolution cells that are being studied on the remotely sensed digital image. It also involves taking geographic coordinates of the ground resolution cell with GPS technology and comparing those with the coordinates of the "pixel" being studied provided by the remote sensing software to understand and analyze the location errors and how it may affect a particular study.

Ground truth is important in the initial supervised classification of an image. When the identity and location of land cover types are known through a combination of field work, maps, and personal experience these areas are known as training sites. The spectral characteristics of these areas are used to train the remote sensing software using decision rules for classifying the rest of the image. These decision rules such as Maximum Likelihood Classification, Parallelepiped Classification, and Minimum Distance Classification offer different techniques to classify an image. Additional ground truth sites allow the remote sensor to establish an error matrix which validates the accuracy of the classification method used. Different classification methods may have different percentages of error for a given classification project. It is important that the remote sensor chooses a classification method that works best with the number of classifications used while  providing the least amount of error.

Ground truth also helps with [[atmospheric correction]]. Since images from satellites obviously have to pass through the atmosphere, they can get distorted because of absorption in the atmosphere. So ground truth can help fully identify objects in satellite photos.

===Errors of commission===
An example of an error of commission is when a pixel reports the presence of a feature (such as trees) that, in reality, is absent (no trees are actually present). Ground truthing ensures that the error matrices have a higher accuracy percentage than would be the case if no pixels were ground truthed. This value is the inverse of the user's accuracy, i.e. Commission Error = 1 - user's accuracy.

===Errors of omission===
An example of an error of omission is when pixels of a certain thing, for example maple trees, are not classified as maple trees.  The process of ground truthing helps to ensure that the pixel is classified correctly and the error matrices are more accurate. This value is the inverse of the producer's accuracy, i.e. Omission Error = 1 - producer's accuracy

== Geographical information systems ==
[[Geographic information system]]s such as GIS, GPS, and GNSS, have become so widespread that the term "ground truth" has taken on special meaning in that context. If the location coordinates returned by a location method such as GPS are an estimate of a location, then the "ground truth" is the actual location on earth. A smart phone might return a set of estimated location coordinates such as 43.87870,-103.45901. The ground truth being estimated by those coordinates is the tip of George Washington's nose on Mt. Rushmore. The accuracy of the estimate is the maximum distance between the location coordinates and the ground truth. We could say in this case that the estimate accuracy is 10 meters, meaning that the point on earth represented by the location coordinates is thought to be within 10 meters of George's nose—the ground truth. In slang, the coordinates indicate where we think George Washington's nose is located, and the ground truth is where it's really at. In practice a smart phone or hand-held GPS unit is routinely able to estimate the ground truth within 6–10 meters. Specialized instruments can reduce GPS measurement error to under a centimeter.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military usage==
US [[military slang]] uses "ground truth" to describe the reality of a tactical situation - as opposed to  intelligence reports and mission plans. The term appears in the title of the [[Iraq War]] documentary film ''[[The Ground Truth]]'' (2006), and also in military publications, for example ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' saying: "Stripes decided to figure out what the ground truth was in Iraq."{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Etymology==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (s.v. "ground truth") records the use of the word "Groundtruth" in the sense of a "fundamental truth" from Henry Ellison's poem "The Siberian Exile's Tale", published in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

In [[computing]], '''hand coding''' means editing the underlying representation of a [[document]] or a [[computer program]], when tools that allow working on a  higher level representation also exist. Typically this means editing the [[source code]], or the textual representation of a document or program, instead of using a [[WYSIWYG]] editor that always displays an approximation of the final product. It may also mean translating the whole or parts of the source code into [[machine language]] manually instead of using a [[compiler]] or an automatic translator.

Most commonly, it refers to directly writing [[HTML]] documents for the web (rather than in a specialized editor), or to writing a program or portion of a program in [[assembly language]] (more rarely raw machine code) rather than in a higher level language. It can also include other [[markup language]]s, such as [[wikitext]].

== Purpose ==
The reasons to use hand coding include the ability to:
* Use features or refinements not supported by the graphical editor or compiler
* Control the [[semantics]] of a document beyond that allowed by the graphical editor&lt;ref&gt;Digital Research (1981): ''XLT86 - 8080 to 8086 Assembly Language Translator - User's Guide''. Digital Research Inc, Pacific Grove ([http://www.s100computers.com/Software%20Folder/Assembler%20Collection/Digital%20Research%20XLT86%20Manual.pdf]).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Produce more elegant source code to help maintenance and integration
* Produce better performing machine code than that produced by the compiler (see [[optimization (computer science)|optimization]])
* Avoid having to pay for expensive WYSIWYG Editors. Note that there are some open-source editors available on the web, however.
* Develop an understanding of the methods underlying a common level of abstraction. For example, although it has become rare in real-life scenarios, computer science students may be required to write a program in an [[assembly language]] to get a notion of [[processor register]]s and other basal elements of [[computer architecture]].
* Escape abstractions and templated code. Hand coding allows more refined control of code, which may improve efficiency, or add functionality that is otherwise unavailable.

Hand coding may require more expertise and time than using automatic tools.

== Hand Code ==
Hand code is [[source code]] which does not have tools that can edit it at a more abstract level.  Hand code must, by definition, be edited and maintained entirely by hand.  Some code can be edited either using an editor/[[Integrated development environment|IDE]] or by hand, but hand code is differentiated from derived code in that it requires human involvement to create and maintain it over time.  Projects may include both hand code and [[derivative code]].

The [[Source-to-source compiler|automatic tools]] responsible for creating derivative code are themselves usually made up entirely, or at least in part, of hand code.

The '''[[IEEE Standards Association|IEEE]] P1906.1''' - Recommended Practice for Nanoscale and Molecular Communication Framework&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-01|title=IEEE Recommended Practice for Nanoscale and Molecular Communication Framework|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7378262|journal=IEEE Std 1906.1-2015|pages=1–64|doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2016.7378262}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standards working group sponsored by the [[IEEE Communications Society]] Standards Development Board whose goal is to develop a common framework for [[nanoscale networking|nanoscale]] and [[molecular communication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/1906.1.html IEEE P1906.1 - Recommended Practice for Nanoscale and Molecular Communication Framework]&lt;/ref&gt; Because this is an [[emerging technology]], the standard is designed to encourage innovation by reaching consensus on a common definition, terminology, framework, goals, metrics, and use-cases that encourage innovation and enable the technology to advance at a faster rate. The draft passed an initial sponsor balloting with comments on January 2, 2015. The comments were addressed by the working group and the resulting draft ballot passed again on August 17, 2015. Finally, additional material regarding [[SBML]] was contributed and the final draft passed again on October 15, 2015. The draft standard was approved by IEEE RevCom in the final quarter of 2015.

== Membership ==

[[Working group]] membership includes experts in industry and academia with strong backgrounds in [[mathematical modeling]], [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[economics]] and [[biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mentor.ieee.org/1906.1/bp/StartPage IEEE COM/Nanoscale and Molecular Communications Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

Electronic components such as [[transistors]], or [[electrical]]/[[Radio propagation|electromagnetic]] message carriers whose operation is similar at the [[Macroscopic scale|macroscale]] and [[nanoscale]] are excluded from the definition. A human-engineered, [[Artificiality|synthetic]] component must form part of the system because it is important to avoid standardizing nature or physical processes. The definition of [[communication]], particularly in the area of [[cell-surface]] interactions as viewed by [[biologist]]s versus non-biologists has been a topic of debate. The interface is viewed as a [[communication channel]], whereas the '[[Cell signaling|receptor-signaling]]-[[gene expression]]' events are the network.
 
The draft currently comprises: definition, terminology, framework, metrics, use-cases, and reference code ([[Ns (simulator)|ns-3]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bush, S.; Paluh, J.; Piro, G.; Rao, V.; Prasad, V.; Eckford, A., [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2465513 "Defining Communication at the Bottom,"] in Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications, IEEE Transactions on, vol.PP, no.99, pp.1-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard provides a very broad foundation and encompasses all approaches to nanoscale communication. While there have been many superficial academic attempts to classify nanoscale communication approaches, the standard considers two fundamental approaches: [[Wave–particle duality|waves and particles]]. This includes any hybrid of the two as well as [[quasiparticle]]s.

A unique contribution of the standard is an [[ns-3]] reference model that enables users to build upon the standard components.

=== Definition ===
*	A precise definition of [[nanoscale networking]] 
**	[[Academic]] and [[Industry|industrial]] researchers have been playing with the concept of nanoscale communication networks, but without a common, well-defined, and precise definition. The IEEE P1906.1 working group has adopted the definitive specification for a nanoscale communication network. The draft standard sets the context of communication within [[length scale]]s by defining communication length scales  ranging from the [[Planck length]] scale to [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] length scales. A focus is upon the progression of physical changes that impact communication as [[length scale]] is reduced.

=== Terminology ===
*	Common terminology for nanoscale networking
**	Nanoscale communication networking is a highly [[interdisciplinary]] endeavor. A clear, common language is required so that interdisciplinary researchers can work smoothly together and minimize cross-discipline misunderstanding due to the common definitions that are defined differently in different fields. The P1906.1 working group has reached consensus on common definitions unique to nanoscale communication networks.

=== Framework ===
*	A framework for ad hoc nanoscale networking
**	There is a pressing need for a [[conceptual model]] of nanoscale networks. A standardized platform for nanoscale communication [[network simulation]] is needed. Researchers are developing simulation models and packages for components related to nanoscale communication networks; however the simulation components are not interoperable, even at a conceptual level. The IEEE P1906.1 working group has adopted a nanoscale communication framework that addresses this need. The result of the framework is known as the ''standard model.''

=== Metrics ===
*	Metrics and analytical model are in development
**	The working group is currently in the process of developing [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]s to uniquely characterize nanoscale communication networks.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, S.F.; Goel, S., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6708562&amp;isnumber=6704980 "Persistence Length as a Metric for Modeling and Simulation of Nanoscale Communication Networks,"] Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on, vol.31, no.12, pp.815-824, December 2013 doi: 10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.12130014.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty metrics have been defined:
*** Message Deliverability 
*** Message Lifetime 
*** Information Density 
*** [[Bandwidth delay product|Bandwidth-Delay Product]]
*** Information and Communication Energy
*** [[Coefficient of restitution|Collision Behavior]]
*** Mass Displacement 
*** Positioning Accuracy of Message Carriers 
*** [[Persistence length|Persistence Length]]
*** [[Diffusion#Diffusion flux|Diffusive Flux]]
*** [[Langevin equation|Langevin Noise]]
*** [[Sensitivity and specificity|Specificity]]
*** [[Relative binding affinity|Affinity]]
*** [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]]
*** [[Angle of arrival|Angular (Angle-of-Arrival) Spectrum]]
*** [[Time of arrival|Delay (Time-of-Arrival) Spectrum]]
*** [[Active networking|Active Network Programmability]]
*** Perturbation Rate 
*** Supersystem Degradation 
*** Bandwidth-Volume Ratio

=== Use-Cases ===
* Specific example applications of the standard
** Specific [[Use case|use-case]]s of nanoscale communication implemented using the P1906.1 definition and framework are provided. A standard mapping between a use-case, or implementation, and the standard model of the framework allows a brief summary of the information required about a use-case to understand its relevance to a nanoscale communication network.

=== Reference model ===
*	Reference code to model the recommended practice is in development
**	[[Ns-3]] reference code is currently in development that implements the developing IEEE P1906.1 recommended practice. The communication framework conceived by the P1906.1 working group has been implemented. A simple example highlighting the interaction and the role of each component in [[electromagnetic]]-based,&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/ieee-p1906-1-reference-code/p1906-dev/tree/master/p1906/model-em 1906 NS-3 Electromagnetic Model]&lt;/ref&gt; [[diffusion]]-based,&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/ieee-p1906-1-reference-code/p1906-dev/tree/master/p1906/model-mol 1906 NS-3 Diffusion Model]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[molecular motor]]-based communication&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/ieee-p1906-1-reference-code/p1906-dev/tree/motor-model 1906 NS-3 Molecular Motor Model]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[nanoscale]] has been developed.

== Applications ==
Applications are numerous, however, there appears to be strong emphasis on medical and biological use-cases in [[nanomedicine]].

== Simulation software ==
The IEEE P1906.1 working group is developing [[ns-3]] nanoscale simulation software that implements the IEEE 1906.1 standard and serves as a reference model and base for development of a wide-variety of interoperable small-scale communication physical layer models.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/ieee-p1906-1-reference-code 1906 NS-3 Electromagnetic Model]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature review ==
The Best Readings on nanoscale communication networks provides good background information related to the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comsoc.org/blog/discover-best-readings-nanoscale-communication-networks DISCOVER THE BEST READINGS IN NANOSCALE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Topics section breaks down the information using the standard approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comsoc.org/best-readings/topics/nanoscale-communication-networks#topics BEST READINGS TOPICS ON NANOSCALE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building on IEEE 1906.1 ==
IEEE 1906.1 is the foundation for nanoscale communication. Additional standards are expected to build upon it. 

'''IEEE 1906.1.1 Standard Data Model for Nanoscale Communication Systems '''
The Standard Data Model for Nanoscale Communication Systems defines a [[network management]] and configuration [[data model]] for nanoscale communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/1906.1.1.html IEEE 1906.1.1 - Standard Data Model for Nanoscale Communication Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
This data model has several goals:
* Ensure compliance with IEEE 1906.1-2015
* Describe the essence of nanoscale communication
* Capture fundamental physics of IEEE 1906.1-2015
* Define configuration and management of simulation and experimental systems
* Provide a self-describing data structure for experimental data.

The data model is written in [[YANG]] and will enable remote remote configuration and operation of nanoscale communication over the Internet using [[NETCONF]].

The '''Instant Pot''' is a brand of [[kitchen appliance]]s. The brand's original and primary products are electronically controlled, combined [[pressure cooker]]s and [[slow cooker]]s. The original cookers are marketed as 7-in-1 appliances designed to consolidate the cooking and preparing of food to one device ([[multicooker]]). The brand has since expanded to include non-pressure slow cookers, [[sous-vide]] immersion circulators, and blenders.

==History==
The concept of a multi-purpose cooker has been around since 2006 with the patent from the [[Midea Group]], which would go on to manufacture the Instant Pot,&lt;ref name="cagc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2015/54204r-eng.php|title=Double Insight Inc. recalls Instant Pot Smart Pressure Cooker|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the function and simple structure of what would become the Instant Pot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Electric pressure cooker patent|date=2007-06-30|url=http://www.google.com/patents/CN2904886Y|accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Robert Wang, Yi Quin, and one other friend, all former employees of [[Nortel]] in Ottawa, Canada, started working on designs for the Instant Pot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/ottawa-entrepreneurs-instant-pot-has-attracted-a-devoted-following-of-home-cooks/article33804422/|title=Ottawa entrepreneur’s Instant Pot has attracted a devoted following of home cooks|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wang is credited as the inventor of the Instant Pot. This beginning model operated as a [[pressure cooker]], [[slow cooker]], rice / [[porridge]] cooker, yogurt maker, [[sauté]] / [[searing]] pan, [[food steamer|steamer]], and food warmer.&lt;ref name="margaretinc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201706/margaret-rhodes/double-insight-instant-cooking-pot-design-awards-2017.html|title=Fired From His Own Startup, This Founder Invented Amazon's Hit Product of 2016|date=2017-05-15|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was under development for 18 months.

==Double Insight==
Double Insight Inc was founded by Robert Wang, Yi Quin, and three other partners in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39058736|title=How a cooker developed a cult following|last=Murphy|first=Jessica|date=2017-03-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the distributor and designers of the Instant Pot. &lt;ref name="cagc"/&gt; Wang has a PhD in [[computer science]] with a specialty in [[artificial intelligence]].

The company became profitable in 2012, with the Instant Pot as their main product. In 2016, Double Insight sold more than 215,000 Instant Pots on Amazon's [[Prime Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2185161|title=Amazon&amp;nbsp;— Press Room&amp;nbsp;— Press Release|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/instant-pot-electric-pressure-cooker-recipes.html|title=Why Do Cooks Love the Instant Pot?

===Recalls===
In July 2015 the Instant Pot Smart-60 cooker was recalled, affecting about 1140 units in the United States and Canada. The defect caused electric current to leak, which could potentially shock the product's user. There were four reported instances of this shock before it was recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2015/instant-pot-pressure-cookers-recalled-by-double-insight|title=Instant Pot Pressure Cookers Recalled by Double Insight {{!}} CPSC.gov|website=www.cpsc.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, five production runs of Instant Pot Gem 65 8-in-1 Multicookers were recalled because they were overheating and subsequently melting due to a manufacturing issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/an-instant-pot-multicooker-is-melting-but-not-the-one-you-think/#ftag=CAD590a51e|title=An Instant Pot multicooker is melting -- but not the one you think|last=Bennett|first=Brian|date=2018-02-23|work=[[CNET]]|access-date=2018-02-23|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Manufacturing==
Instant Pots are manufactured by the Midea Group in GuangDong, China. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2015/54204r-eng.php|title=Double Insight Inc. recalls Instant Pot Smart Pressure Cooker|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9728">The '''Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy''' ('''IATP''') is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] research and [[advocacy organization]] that promotes [[sustainability|sustainable]] food, farm, and trade systems. IATP has offices in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], and operates both locally and internationally.

==Areas of work==

IATP works to integrate sustainability throughout the food and farm system, from supporting [[farmers]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]] to securing universal access to healthy food. IATP identifies the impact [[trade pact|trade agreements]] have on farmers, consumers and the environment, while promoting a [[fair trade]] system that supports locally based development, [[labor rights|labor]] and [[human rights]], and democratic institutions. IATP develops alternative economic models that integrate environmental sustainability into rural development.

==History==

Minnesota Secretary of State [[Mark Ritchie]] returned to the United States from a 1986 Geneva meeting and incorporated the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Ariel Aaronson]], Taking Trade to the Streets: The Lost History of Public Efforts to Shape Globalization (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2001) 142-173.&lt;/ref&gt; as a nonprofit, [[tax-exempt organization]], with the mission of fostering sustainable rural communities. In 1987, IATP began to organize and report on the newly launched round of international trade negotiations being conducted by the GATT, which eventually became the WTO. The rules of agricultural trade set in the GATT&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Brecher and Tim Costello, Global Village or Global Pillage: Economic Reconstruction From the Bottom Up (Boston: [[South End Press]], 1994) 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented at the WTO have deeply influenced national and local farm policies around the globe over the last two decades.

In the 1990s, IATP expanded beyond its initial focus on international policymaking institutions like the WTO, and regional free trade agreements like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], to include the promotion of positive alternatives to economically, socially and environmentally destructive agricultural and trade practices. For example, with the Center for Agriculture and the Environment in the Netherlands, IATP developed tools to help U.S. farmers increase their income by reducing on-farm fertilizer use.

Jim Harkness became IATP’s new president in 2006, after spending the previous 16 years in China, most recently as the Executive Director for the [[World Wildlife Fund]] in China. In 2014, Juliette Majot became the organization's third President, changing the title to Executive Director.

'''J. Lyons &amp; Co.''' was a British restaurant chain, food manufacturing, and hotel conglomerate founded in 1884.

==Origins and early history==
[[File:Sir Joseph Lyons.png|thumb|right|Sir Joseph Lyons DL, in a photograph published in 1914, wearing the uniform of [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of the [[County of London]]]]

The company began as collaboration between the professional artist [[Joseph Lyons (caterer)|Joseph Lyons]] and his brothers in law, [[Isidore Gluckstein|Isidore]] and [[Montague Gluckstein]], as a spin off from the [[Salmon &amp; Gluckstein]] tobacco company.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Comay, ''Who's who in Jewish History: After the Period of the Old Testament' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 the company started a teashop in Piccadilly, London, and from 1909 developed this into a chain of teashops known as Lyons' Corner Houses. The company also ran high class restaurants, founding the Trocadero in 1895, and hotels including the Strand Palace, opened in 1909, the Regent Palace, opened in 1915, and the Cumberland Hotel, opened in 1933, all in London. From the 1930s Lyons began to develop a pioneering range of teas, biscuits and cakes that were sold in grocery stores across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Poter, ''London: A Social History'' (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyons was appointed to run the company, and it was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Comay, ''Who's who in Jewish History: After the Period of the Old Testament' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995) p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Lyons &amp; Co. was a pioneer in introducing computers to business. Between 1951 and 1963, the company manufactured and sold a range of [[LEO (computer)|LEO (Lyons Electronic Office)]] computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leo-computers.org.uk/|title=Leo Computers Society|website=www.leo-computers.org.uk|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products and image==

The company was a substantial food manufacturer, with factories at [[Cadby Hall]] in [[Hammersmith]], and from 1921 at [[J. Lyons and Co., Greenford|Greenford]], producing bread, cakes, pies, tea, coffee and ice cream.

To the public, J. Lyons &amp; Co. were best known for their chain of [[tea shop]]s which opened from 1894&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Harlan Walker|title=[[Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery]] 1991: Public Eating; Proceedings |year=1992 |publisher=Prospect Books |isbn=978-0-907325-47-5 |chapter= English Tearoom |author=Brigid Keane, Olive Portnoy |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=FrWgDRkS90EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally closed in 1981, and for the Lyons Corner Houses in the [[West End of London]]. The tea shops were slightly more up market than their ABC ([[Aerated Bread Company]]) counterparts. They were notable for their [[interior design]], from the 1920s [[Oliver P. Bernard]] being consultant artistic director. Until the 1940s they had a certain [[working-class]] chic, but by the 1950s and '60s they were quick stops for busy shoppers where one could drink a cup of tea and eat a snack or an inexpensive meal. The tea shops always had a bakery counter at the front, and their signs, [[art nouveau]] gold lettering on white, were a familiar landmark. Before the [[Second World War]] service was to the table by uniformed waitresses, known as '[[Nippy|Nippies]]', after the War the tea shops converted to cafeteria service.

===Corner Houses===
[[Image:Customers enjoying afternoon tea at Lyon's Corner House on Coventry Street, London, 1942. D6573.jpg|thumb|Customers enjoying afternoon tea at Lyons' Corner House on Coventry Street, London, 1942]]

Lyons' Corner Houses, which first appeared in 1909 and remained until 1977, were noted for their [[art deco]] style. Situated on or near the corners of [[Coventry Street]], [[Strand, London|Strand]] and [[Tottenham Court Road]], they and the Maison Lyonses at [[Marble Arch]] and in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] were large buildings on four or five floors, the ground floor of which was a food hall with counters for delicatessen, sweets and chocolates, cakes, fruit, flowers and other products. In addition, they possessed hairdressing salons, telephone booths, theatre booking agencies and at one period a twice-a-day food delivery service. On the other floors were several restaurants, each with a different theme and all with their own musicians. For a time the Corner Houses were open 24 hours a day, and at their peak each branch employed around 400 staff. They featured window displays, and, in the [[post-war]] period, the Corner Houses were smarter and grander than the local tea shops. Between 1896 and 1965 Lyons owned the [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero]], which was similar in size and style to the Corner Houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kzwp.com/lyons/cornerhouses.htm |title=J. Lyons &amp; Co catering outlets|accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restaurants===

[[Image:A busy scene at Lyons Corner House Brasserie, Coventry Street, London, 1942. D6570.jpg|thumb|Lyons' Corner House Brasserie with band, Coventry Street, London, 1942]]
As well as the tea shops and Corner Houses, Lyons ran other large restaurants such as the [[Angel Cafe Restaurant]] in Islington and the Throgmorton in Throgmorton Street. Its chains have included Steak Houses (1961–1988), [[Wimpy (brand)|Wimpy Bars]] (1953–1976), [[Baskin-Robbins]] (1974-) and [[Dunkin' Donuts]] (1989-). The artist Kay Lipton designed all the windows for the Corner Houses under the jurisdiction of Norman Joseph, the director post-war.

===Hotels===
The [[Regent Palace Hotel]], Glasshouse Street, [[London]] was operated by Strand Hotels Limited, a subsidiary of J. Lyons and Company and opened on 16 May 1915. Strand Hotels also operated the Cumberland Hotel (Marble Arch, London), Kingsley Hotel, Park Court Hotel, Windsor Hotel, White's Hotel and the [[Strand Palace Hotel]] after the inception of Strand Hotels Limited. The last London hotel that they operated until the demise of the group in the mid-70s was the [[Tower Hotel, London|Tower Hotel]] situated by Tower Bridge in London.

===Biscuits company===
In 1938, Lyons purchased the Bee Bee Biscuit Company, which manufactured [[biscuits]] from its factories in [[Blackpool]]. Six years later, Lyons changed the company's name to Symbol Biscuits Ltd. and began selling biscuits under the Symbol and Lyons brand names: one of their innovations was [[Maryland Cookies]] in 1956. In 1990, Lyons changed the Symbol Biscuits name to Lyons Biscuits Ltd.&lt;ref name='Symbol Biscuits'&gt;{{Cite web |last= Bird |first= Peter |title= Symbol Biscuits Ltd (Lyons Biscuits Ltd) |year= 2002 |url= http://www.kzwp.com/lyons/symbol.htm |accessdate= 5 November 2007 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
===Supporting the war effort===
The [[British re-armament|rearmament]] period just before [[World War II]] saw a big expansion in the number of [[Royal Ordnance Factory|Royal Ordnance Factories]] (ROFs), which were [[United Kingdom|British]] government-owned. However, due to shortages of [[management]] resources some ROFs were run as agency factories; and J. Lyons and Co. ran at least one, [[ROF Elstow]].&lt;ref&gt;Bates, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;  The management and stock control systems needed in the ROFs, in respect of control of raw materials and "perishable" finished products, were somewhat similar to those used in the catering business; and J. Lyons was ideally suited to this task. They do not appear to have any involvement in managing these after 1945, when the ROFs started to run down.

===Contribution to computing in business===
The top management of Lyons, with its background in the use of mechanical adding machines, saw the necessity of new electrical computers for organising the distribution of cakes and other highly perishable goods. They, therefore, substantially financed the University of Cambridge's [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] (EDSAC) which was the second electronic digital stored-program computer to go into regular service, and built their own programmable [[digital computer]]s and became the first user of these in businesses, with the [[LEO (computer)|LEO I]] digital computer: the ''Lyons Electronic Office I'', designed and built by Dr John Pinkerton under the able leadership of John Simmons. It handled the company's accounts and logistics. Lyons also included the weather forecast to ensure goods carried by their "fresh produce" delivery vans were not wasted in large quantities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://is2.lse.ac.uk/leo/About_LEO.htm |title=About L E O |author=London School of Economics|accessdate=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google]] chairman [[Eric Schmidt]] called this "the world's first office computer", built in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14683133 |title=Google's Eric Schmidt criticises education in the UK |publisher=BBC News |date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsidiary LEO Computers Ltd was formed in 1954 and went on to build 11 Leo II and 94 Leo III computers that were sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leo-computers.org.uk/|title=Leo Computers Society|website=www.leo-computers.org.uk|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
[[File:Lyons Corner House recreation, Museum of London.JPG|thumb|Lyons Corner House recreated in the [[Museum of London]]]]
The company was losing money in the 1960s but remained under the control of the Salmon family, descended from a founding partner. Lyons began to close some of its London tea shops and hotels; in 1963 it also merged its LEO Computers business with [[English Electric]]'s computer interests to form the jointly owned English Electric LEO.

In 1964, Lyons sold their half-stake; and English Electric merged the company with [[Marconi Company|Marconi]]'s computer interests to form English Electric LEO Marconi Computers. A continuing problem in the British computer industry was both lack of investment capital and competition with the much larger U.S. computer companies, such as [[IBM]]. English Electric LEO Marconi Computers merged with other companies to form [[International Computers Limited]] (ICL) which was bought by [[Fujitsu]] in 1990.

In 1978, Lyons was acquired by [[Allied Breweries]] and became part of the resulting [[Allied Domecq|Allied Lyons]].  It fell on hard economic times in the late 1980s; and was sold, eventually being broken up with its [[ice cream]] and [[ice lolly]] products, which were branded as [[Lyons Maid]], being sold to [[Nestlé]].  Other parts that were sold off included Lyons Cakes (sold to [[RHM]] and ending up as part of their Manor Bakeries subsidiary which also makes [[Mr Kipling|Mr Kipling's Cakes]]) and [[Ready Brek]] cereal (ending up being owned by [[Weetabix Limited]]). At the end of 1994, Lyons sold Lyons Biscuits to Hillsdown Holdings, which later sold it to a U.S. investment firm which subsequently sold it to large biscuit manufacturer [[Burton's Foods]].&lt;ref name='Symbol Biscuits' /&gt;

The J. Lyons &amp; Co. papers are now stored in the [[London Metropolitan Archives]].

The niece and nephew of the Gluckstein brothers were [[Gluck (Hannah Gluckstein)|Hannah Gluckstein]], a painter; and [[Louis Gluckstein]], a Conservative politician. A descendant of the Salmon side of the original partnership is [[Nigella Lawson]].

==Notable employees==

==History==

===Founding and rise as a textile center===
[[Image:1912 Lawrence Textile Strike 1.jpg|thumb|[[1912 Lawrence textile strike]], Massachusetts National Guardsmen with fixed bayonets surround a parade of strikers.]]

Native Americans, namely the [[Pennacook]] or Pentucket tribe, had a presence in this area. Evidence of farming at Den Rock Park and arrowhead manufacturing on the site of where the Wood Mill now sits have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice B. Dorgan, ''Indian History and Traditions'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeans first settled the Haverhill area in 1640, colonists from Newbury following the [[Merrimack River]] in from the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Sidney Howe, ''Historical sketch of the town of Methuen: from its settlement to the year 1876'' (1876), p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The area that would become Lawrence was then part of Methuen and Andover. The first settlement came in 1655 with the establishment of a [[blockhouse]] in Shawsheen Fields, now South Lawrence.

The future site of the city (formerly parts of [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]] and [[Methuen, Massachusetts|Methuen]]), was purchased by a consortium of local industrialists. The Water Power Association members: [[Abbott Lawrence]], [[Edmund Bartlett]], [[Thomas Hopkinson]] of [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[John Nesmith]] and [[Saunders family#Daniel Saunders, Sr.|Daniel Saunders]], had purchased control of Peter's Falls on the Merrimack River and hence controlled Bodwell's Falls the site of the present [[Great Stone Dam]]. The group allotted fifty thousand dollars to buy land along the river to develop.&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;Jonathan Franklin Chesley Hayes, ''History of the City of Lawrence'' (1868)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} In 1844, the group petitioned the legislature to act as a corporation, known as the [[Essex Company]], which incorporated on April 16, 1845. The first excavations for the Great Stone Dam to harness the Merrimack River's water power were done on August 1, 1845.&lt;ref name=Hayes/&gt;{{rp|17}} The Essex Company would sell the water power to corporations such as the [[Arlington Mills]], as well as organize construction of mills and build to suit. Until 1847, when the state legislature recognized the community as a town, it was called interchangeably the "New City", "Essex" or "Merrimac".&lt;ref name=Hayes/&gt;{{rp|23}} The post office, built in 1846, used the designation "Merrimac". Incorporation as a city would come in 1853, and the name "Lawrence", merely chosen as a token of respect to Abbott Lawrence, who it cannot be verified ever saw the city named after him.

Canals were dug on both the north and the south banks to provide power to the factories that would soon be built on its banks as both mill owners and workers from across the city and the world flocked to the city in droves; many were Irish laborers who had experience with similar building work. The work was dangerous: injuries and even death were not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Skulski, Ken. ''The History of Lawrence Massachusetts, Volume 2'', page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Bread and Roses Strike of 1912====
{{Main|1912 Lawrence textile strike}}
Working conditions in the mills were unsafe and in 1860 the [[Pemberton Mill]] collapsed, killing 145 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9902E6DC1638E533A2575BC1A9629C94679FD7CF |title=The Fall of the Pemberton Mill |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=April 18, 1886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As immigrants flooded into the United States in the mid to late 19th century, the population of Lawrence abounded with skilled and unskilled workers from several countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Lawrence was the scene of the infamous [[Bread and Roses|Bread and Roses Strike]], also known as the [[Lawrence Textile Strike]], one of the more important labor actions in American history.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Post-War history===
Lawrence was a great wool-processing center until that industry declined in the 1950s. The decline left Lawrence a struggling city.  The population of Lawrence declined from over 80,000 residents in 1950 (and a high of 94,270 in 1920) to approximately 64,000 residents in 1980, the low point of Lawrence's population.

====Urban redevelopment and renewal====
[[Image:Lawrence Riverfront.jpg|thumb|left|Merrimack River at Lawrence]]
Like other northeastern cities suffering from the effects of post-[[World War II]] [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]], Lawrence has often made efforts at revitalization, some of them controversial. For example, half of the enormous [[American Woolen Company|Wood Mill]], powered by the [[Great Stone Dam]] and once the largest mills in the world, was knocked down in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Lawrence Redevelopment Authority and city officials utilized eminent domain for a perceived public benefit, via a top down approach, to revitalize the city throughout the 1960s. Known first as urban redevelopment, and then urban renewal, Lawrence's local government's actions towards vulnerable immigrant and poor communities, contained an undercurrent of gentrification which lies beneath the goals to revitalize Lawrence. There was a clash of differing ideals and perceptions of blight, growth, and what constituted a desirable community. Ultimately the discussion left out those members of the community who would be directly impacted by urban redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://gradworks.umi.com/15/07/1507806.html| title=ProQuest Document View - Urban redevelopment of Lawrence, MA: A retrospective case study of the Plains Neighborhood| work=umi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the guise of [[urban renewal]], large tracts of downtown Lawrence were razed in the 1970s, and replaced with parking lots and a three-story parking garage connected to a new Intown Mall intended to compete with newly constructed suburban malls. The historic Theater Row along Broadway was also razed, destroying ornate movie palaces of the 1920s and 1930s that entertained mill workers through the [[Great Depression]] and the Second World War. The city's main post office, an ornate federalist style building at the corner of Broadway and Essex Street, was razed. Most of the structures were replaced with one-story, steel-frame structures with large parking lots, housing such establishments as fast food restaurants and chain drug stores, fundamentally changing the character of the center of Lawrence.{{Citation needed|reason=Original ref dead and removed|date=November 2009}}

Lawrence also attempted to increase its employment base by attracting industries unwanted in other communities, such as waste treatment facilities and incinerators.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} From 1980 until 1998, private corporations operated two trash incinerators in Lawrence.  Activist residents successfully blocked the approval of a waste treatment center on the banks of the Merrimack River near the current site of Salvatore's Pizza on Merrimack Street.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Recently the focus of Lawrence's urban renewal has shifted to preservation rather than sprawl.

====Events of the 1980s and 1990s====
Immigrants from the [[Dominican Republic]] and migrants from [[Puerto Rico]] began arriving in Lawrence in significant numbers in the late 1960s, attracted by cheap housing and a history of tolerance toward immigrants.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In 1984, tensions between remaining working class whites and increasing numbers of Hispanic youth flared into a riot, centered at the intersection of Haverhill Street and Oxford Street, where a number of buildings were destroyed by [[Molotov cocktail]]s and over 300 people were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Crackdown by police cools Lawrence riots| newspaper = [[Spokane Chronicle]] | location = Spokane, Washington| page = 4| date = August 11, 1984| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M8USAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qPkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5550,2277710&amp;dq=lawrence+riots+1984&amp;hl=en| accessdate = 4 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Two Nights of Rioting Bring a Curfew to Lawrence Mass.| newspaper = [[New York Times]] | location = New York City| page = 4| date = August 10, 1984| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/11/us/two-nights-of-rioting-bring-a-curfew-to-lawrence-mass.html| accessdate = 23 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence saw further setbacks during the recession of the early 1990s as a wave of arson plagued the city. Over 200 buildings were set alight in an eighteen-month period in 1991–92, many of them abandoned residences and industrial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = McGhee| first = Neil| title = Arson epidemic continues in Massachusetts town| newspaper = National Underwriter Property &amp; Casualty-Risk &amp; Benefits Management| publisher = The National Underwriter Company| date = August 24, 1992| url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-12533408.html| accessdate = 4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Malden Mills]] factory burned down on December 11, 1995. CEO Aaron Feuerstein decided to continue paying the salaries of all the now-unemployed workers while the factory was being rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;60 Minutes: The Mensch Of Malden Mills&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent trends====
A sharp reduction in violent crime starting in 2004&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2011/10/17/41306/Lawrence-Massachusetts-mayor-faces-the-wrath-of-residents&lt;/ref&gt; and massive private investment in former mill buildings along the Merrimack River, including the remaining section of the historic [[American Woolen Company|Wood Mill]] – to be converted into commercial, residential and education uses – have lent encouragement to boosters of the city.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} One of the final remaining mills in the city is [[Malden Mills]]. Lawrence's downtown has seen a resurgence of business activity as Hispanic-owned businesses have opened along Essex Street, the historic shopping street of Lawrence that remained largely shuttered since the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In June 2007, the city approved the sale of the Intown Mall, largely abandoned since the early 1990s recession, to [[Northern Essex Community College]] for the development of a medical sciences center, the construction of which commenced in 2012 when the InTown Mall was finally removed.&lt;ref&gt;InTown Mall demolition begins today, making way for college health technologies building, by Keith Eddings, Eagle-Tribune, 3 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= | url=http://departments.necc.mass.edu/newsroom/2012/01/04/intown-mall-comes-tumbling-down/| title=InTown Mall Comes Tumbling Down| work=Newsroom - Northern Essex Community College}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large multi-structure fire in January 2008 destroyed many wooden structures just south of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Allen| first1 = Scott | last2 = Ryan| first2=Andrew | title = 150 left homeless from Lawrence fire| newspaper = [[The Boston Globe]] | location = Boston, Massachusetts| date = January 21, 2008| url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/01/fire_engulfs_do.html| accessdate = 4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poor financial situation that has worsened with the recent global recession and has led to multiple municipal layoffs had Lawrence contemplating [[receivership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eagletribune.com/local/x1412996113/Lawrence-fiscal-crisis-prompts-talk-of-bankruptcy-receivership |last= Kirk| first= Bill |title=Lawrence fiscal crisis prompts talk of bankruptcy, receivership| location=  North Andover, MA  |work= [[The Eagle-Tribune]] |date= 14 February 2010| accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Massachusetts gas explosions}}
On September 13, 2018, a series of gas explosions and fires broke out in as many as 40 homes in Lawrence, [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], and [[North Andover, Massachusetts|North Andover]].

==History of Lawrence immigrant communities==
Lawrence has been aptly nicknamed the "Immigrant City".&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cole |first=Donald B. |title=Immigrant City: Lawrence, Massachusetts, 1845–1921 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]] |location=|year=1963 |pages= |isbn=0-8078-0876-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been home to numerous different immigrant communities, most of whom arrived during the great wave of European immigration to America that ended in the 1920s.

===Immigrant communities, 1845–1920===
Lawrence became home to large groups of immigrants from Europe, beginning with the Irish in 1845, Germans after the social upheaval in Germany in 1848, Swedes fleeing an overcrowded Sweden, and French Canadians seeking to escape hard northern farm life from the 1850s onward. A second wave began arriving after 1900, as part of the great mass of Italian and Eastern European immigrants, including Jews from Russia, Poland, Lithuania and neighboring regions. Immigration to the United States was severely curtailed in the 1920s with the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], when foreign born immigration to Lawrence virtually ceased for over 40 years.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt;

In 1890, the foreign-born population of 28,577 was divided as follows, with the significant remainder of the population being children of foreign born residents: 7,058 Irish; 6,999 French Canadians; 5,131 English; 2,465 German; 1,683 English Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lawrence (Massachusetts) |display=Lawrence |volume=16 |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, toward the end of the first wave of immigration, most ethnic groups had numerous social clubs in the city.  The Portuguese had 2; the English had 2; the Jews had 3; the Armenians, 5; the Lebanese and Syrians, 6; the Irish, 8; the Polish, 9; the French Canadians and Belgian-French, 14; the Lithuanians, 18; the Italians, 32; and the Germans, 47.&lt;ref name="Skulski"/&gt;  However, the center of social life, even more than clubs or fraternal organizations, was churches.  Lawrence is dotted with churches, many now closed, torn down or converted into other uses. These churches signify, more than any other artifacts, the immigrant communities that once lived within walking distance of each church.&lt;ref name="Skulski"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skulski| first1=Ken| last2=Dengler |first2=Eartha |last3=Khalife |first3=Katherine |title=Lawrence, Massachusetts |publisher=Arcadia Pub |location=[[Dover, NH]] |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-7524-0229-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://lucieslegacy.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/history-of-lawrence-ma-immigrant.html| title=Lucie's Legacy: History of Lawrence, MA - Immigrant Communities| work=lucieslegacy.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish====
Irish immigrants arrived in Lawrence at its birth, which nearly coincided with the Great Potato Famine of the 1840s, the event that drove great numbers of Irish out of Ireland. The Great Stone Dam, constructed in 1845–1848 to power the nascent textile mills, was largely built by Irish laborers. The first Irish immigrants settled in the area south of the Merrimack River near the intersection of Kingston Street and South Broadway. Their shantytown settlement put them close to the dam being constructed, but away from the Essex Corporation row houses built north of the river to attract New England farm girls as millworkers. The religious needs of the Irish were initially met by the Immaculate Conception church, originally erected near the corner of Chestnut and White Street in 1846, the first Roman Catholic church in Lawrence. In December, 1848, the Reverend James O'Donnell erected "old" St. Mary's Church. By 1847, observers counted over ninety shanties in the Irish shantytown. In 1869, the Irish were able to collect sufficient funds form their own church, St. Patrick's, on South Broadway.

====Germans====
The first sizable German community arrived following the revolutions of 1848.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; However, a larger German community was formed after 1871, when industrial workers from [[Saxony]] were displaced by economic competition from new industrial areas like the [[Ruhr]].&lt;ref name="McCaffery"&gt;McCaffery, Robert Paul, "Islands of Deutschtum: German-Americans in Manchester, New Hampshire and Lawrence, Massachusetts, 1870–1942". ''New German–American Studies, Vol 11''. Peter Lang, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The German community was characterized by numerous school clubs, shooting clubs, national and regional clubs, as well as men's choirs and mutual aid societies,&lt;ref name="McCaffery"/&gt; many of which were clustered around the Turn Verein, a major social club on Park Street.&lt;ref name="Skulski"/&gt;  Germans had a considerable number of churches in Lawrence, including Church of the Assumption of Mary (German Catholic) parish formed in 1887 on Lawrence Street,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Municipal History of Essex County in Massachusetts, Tercentenary Edition, Benj. F. Arrington, Editor-in-chief, Volume II 1922 Lewis Historical Publishing Company New York&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of Protestant churches including The German Methodist Episcopal Church, Vine street, organized in 1878; and the German Presbyterian, East Haverhill street, organized 1872 from which the Methodist church split in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italians====
Some Italian immigrants celebrated Mass in the basement chapel of the largely Irish St. Laurence O'Toole Church, at the intersection of East Haverhill Street and Newbury Street, until they had collected sufficient funds to erect the Holy Rosary Church in 1909 nearby at the intersection of Union Street and Essex Street.&lt;ref name="Skulski"/&gt; Immigrants from [[Lentini]] (a ''comune'' in the Sicilian province of [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]]) and from the Sicilian province of [[Catania]] maintained a particular devotion to three Catholic martyrs, Saint Alfio, Saint Filadelfo and Saint Cirino, and in 1923 began celebrating a procession on their feast day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centamore.it/TreSanti/WithTrueFaith_Testo.asp Festa of Saints Alfio, Filadelfo, and Cirino&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the participants live in neighboring towns, the Feast of Three Saints festival continues in Lawrence today.  Many of the Italians who lived in the Newbury Street area had immigrated from [[Trecastagni]], [[Viagrande]], [[Acireale]], and [[Nicolosi]], Italy.

====French Canadians====
French Canadians were the second major immigrant group to settle in Lawrence. In 1872, they erected their first church, St. Anne's, at the corner of Haverhill and Franklin streets. Within decades, St. Anne's established a "missionary church", Sacred Heart on South Broadway, to serve the burgeoning [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] community in South Lawrence. Later it would also establish the "missionary" parishes in Methuen: Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St. Theresa's (Notre-Dame du Mont Carmel et St-Thérèse). The French-Canadians arrived from various farming areas of Quebec where the old parishes were overpopulated: some people moved up north ([[Abitibi-Temiscamingue|Abitibi]] and [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]]), while others moved to industrial towns to find work ([[Montreal]], Quebec; but also in the United States). Others who integrated themselves into these French-Canadian communities were actually [[Acadians]] who had left the Canadian Maritimes of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] also in search of work.

====Lebanese====
Lawrence residents frequently referred to their Arabic-speaking Middle Eastern community as "[[Syrian]]". In fact, most so-called Syrians in Lawrence were from present-day [[Lebanon]] and were largely [[Maronite Christian]].&lt;ref name="Skulski"/&gt; [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] immigrants organized [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]]'s [[Maronite Church]] in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanthonylawrence.org/history1.htm St. Anthony's Marionite Church website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705144205/http://www.stanthonylawrence.org/history1.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and St. Joseph's Melkite Greek-Catholic Church, as well as [[St. George]]'s [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antiochian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="Skulski"/&gt;

====Jews====
Jewish merchants became increasingly numerous in Lawrence and specialized in dry goods and retail shops. The fanciest men's clothing store in Lawrence, Kap's, established in 1902 and closed in the early 1990s, was founded by Elias Kapelson, born in [[Lithuania]]. Jacob Sandler and two brothers also immigrated from Lithuania in approximately 1900 and established Sandlers Department Store, which continued in business until 1978. In the 1880s, the first Jewish arrivals established a community around Common, Valley, Concord and Lowell streets. As of 1922, there were at least two noteworthy congregations, both on Concord Street: Congregation of Sons of Israel (Jewish), organized October 3, 1894. Synagogue on Concord street built in 1913; and Congregation of Anshea Sfard (Jewish), organized April 6, 1900. Synagogue on Concord street built in the autumn of 1907.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In the 1920s, the Jews of Lawrence began congregating further up Tower Hill, where they erected two [[synagogue]]s on Lowell Street above Milton Street, as well as a Jewish Community Center on nearby Haverhill Street. All three institutions had closed their doors by 1990 as the remaining elderly members of the community died out or moved away.&lt;ref name="Skulski"/&gt;

====Polish====
The Polish community of Lawrence was estimated to be only 600–800 persons in 1900. However, by 1905, the community had expanded sufficiently to fund the construction of the Holy Trinity Church at the corner of Avon and Trinity streets.&lt;ref name="Skulski"/&gt; Their numbers grew to 2,100 Poles in 1910. Like many of their immigrant brethren from other nations, most of the Poles were employed in woolen and worsted goods manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polishroots.org/paha/polish_farmers_workers.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316165002/http://www.polishroots.org/paha/polish_farmers_workers.htm |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lithuanians====
Lawrence had a sizable enough Lithuanian community to warrant the formation of both Lithuanian Catholic and [[Lithuanian National Catholic Church|Lithuanian National Catholic]] churches. St. Francis (Lithuanian Catholic Church) on Bradford Street was formed in 1903 by Rev. James T. O'Reilly of St. Mary's, in a building previously occupied by St. John's Episcopal Church.&lt;ref&gt;Municipal History of Essex County in Massachusetts, Tercentenary Edition, Benj. F. Arrington, Editor-in-chief, Volume II 1922 Lewis Historical Publishing Company New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  The church closed in 2002, merging with Holy Trinity (Polish) and SS. Peter and Paul (Portuguese). Sacred Heart Lithuanian National Catholic Church was established about 1917 and located on Garden Street until its closure and sale in 2001.

====English====
A sizable English community, composed mainly of unskilled laborers who arrived after 1880, sought work in the textile mills where they were given choice jobs by the Yankee overseers on account of their shared linguistic heritage and close cultural links.

====Yankee farmers====
[[File:Lawrence Street Congregational Church - Lawrence, MA - DSC03581.JPG|thumb|left|Lawrence Street Congregational Church]]

Not all immigrants to Lawrence were foreign-born or their children. Yankee farmers, unable to compete against the cheaper farmlands of the [[Midwest]] that had been linked to the East coast by rail, settled in corners of Lawrence. [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]] were the second Protestant denomination to begin worship in Lawrence after the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], with the formation of the [[Lawrence Street Congregational Church]] in 1847,&lt;ref name=Quartercentennial&gt;''Quarter-centennial history of Lawrence, Massachusetts: With portraits and biographical sketches of ex-mayors, the board of may...''

Office, 1878&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} and the first in South Lawrence, with the erection in 1852 of the first South Congregational Church on South Broadway, near the corner of Andover Street.&lt;ref name="Skulski"/&gt;  Baptist churches included The First Baptist Church, one of the first churches in Lawrence, which was organized in the spring of 1947 and was known as Amesbury Street Baptist Church.  Second Baptist was organized September 6, 1860; its building dedicated in 1874.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===New immigrants, 1970 to present===
Immigration of foreign born workers to Lawrence largely ceased in 1921 with the passage of strict quotas against immigrants from the countries that had supplied the cheap, unskilled workers. Although many quotas were lifted after the Second World War, foreign immigration to Lawrence only picked up again in the early 1960s with Hispanic immigrants from [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and other Latin American countries. Immigrants from [[Southeast Asia]], particularly [[Vietnam]], have also settled in Lawrence.

Indicative of immigration trends, several Catholic churches now conduct masses in two or more languages. St. Patrick's Church, a Catholic church in Lawrence and once an Irish bastion, has celebrated Spanish masses on Sundays since 1999. A mass in Vietnamese is also offered every other week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfh.org/newsandevents/newsletter/MassHumanities/Spring2005/parrish.html "Scenes from a Parish" Mass Humanities, Spring 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620015510/http://www.mfh.org/newsandevents/newsletter/MassHumanities/Spring2005/parrish.html |date=2008-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Mary's of the Assumption Parish is the largest Catholic parish in Lawrence by Mass attendance and number of registered parishioners. It has the largest multi-lingual congregation in the city and has been offering Spanish masses since the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Since the 1990s, increasing numbers of former Catholic churches, closed since the 1980s when their Irish or Italian congregations died out, have been bought by Hispanic [[evangelical]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Betances| first=Yadira| url=http://www.eagletribune.com/homepage/local_story_360094509?keyword=leadpicturestory+page=0| title=Protestant congregations eyeing vacant Catholic church properties| newspaper=Eagle-Tribune| date=December 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000 Census revealed the following population breakdown, illustrating the shift toward newer immigrant groups:

Dominican Republic, 22%; Puerto Rican, 22%; other Hispanic or Latino, 12%; Irish, 7%; Italian, 7%, French (except Basque), 5%; Black or African American, 5%; French Canadian, 5%; English, 3%; Arab, 2%; German, 2%;  Lebanese, 2%; Central American, 1%; Polish, 1%; Portuguese, 1%; Guatemalan, 1%;  Vietnamese, 1%; South American, 1%; Spanish, 1%; Cambodian, 1%; Scottish, 1%; Cuban, 1%; Scotch-Irish, 1%; Ecuadoran, 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genealogyInfo.php?locIndex=2999|title=Lawrence - Lawrence - Ancestry &amp; family history - ePodunk|work=epodunk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:High Service Water Tower (1895), Lawrence, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|[[High Service Water Tower and Reservoir|High Service Water Tower]] (1895), also called Tower Hill Water Tower, a notable [[eyecatchers|eyecatcher]] or [[folly]], named an [[American Water Landmark]] in 1979 by the [[American Water Works Association]].]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|7.0|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}} (6.07%) is water. Lawrence is on both sides of the Merrimack River, approximately {{convert|26|mi}} upstream from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. On the north side of the river, it is surrounded by [[Methuen, Massachusetts|Methuen]]. On the south side of the river, the town is bordered by [[North Andover, Massachusetts|North Andover]] to the east, and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]] to the south and southwest. Lawrence is approximately {{convert|30|mi}} north-northwest of [[Boston]] and {{convert|27|mi}} southeast of [[Manchester, New Hampshire]].

Aside from the [[Merrimack River]], other water features include the [[Spicket River]], which flows into the Merrimack from Methuen, and the [[Shawsheen River]], which forms the southeastern border of the city. Lawrence has two power canals that were formerly used to provide [[hydropower]] to the mills - one on the north bank of the river, the other on the south. Channeling water into these canals is the [[Great Stone Dam]], which lies across the entire Merrimack and was, at the time of its construction in the 1840s, the largest dam in the world. The highest point in Lawrence is the top of Tower Hill in the northwest corner of the city, rising approximately {{convert|240|ft|m}} above sea level. Other prominent hills include Prospect Hill, in the northeast corner of the city, and Mount Vernon, along the southern edge of the city. Most industrial activity was concentrated in the flatlands along the rivers. Den Rock Park, a wooded conservation district on the southern edge of Lawrence that spans the Lawrence-Andover town line, provides recreation for nature lovers and rock-climbers alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groundworklawrence.org/events/Den_Rock_Park_Guide.pdf Den Rock Park Trail Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127035915/http://www.groundworklawrence.org/events/Den_Rock_Park_Guide.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several small parks throughout town.

==Transportation==

Lawrence lies along [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]], which passes through the eastern portion of the city. There are three exits entirely within the city, though two more provide access from just outside the city limits. The town is also served by [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]] passing from south to north through the city, and [[Massachusetts Route 110|Route 110]], which passes from east to west through the northern half of the city. [[Massachusetts Route 114|Route 114]] also has its western terminus at Route 28 at the Merrimack River. Lawrence is the site of four road crossings and a railroad crossing over the Merrimack, including the O'Leary Bridge (Route 28), a railroad bridge, the Casey Bridge (bringing Parker Street and access to Route 114 and the Lawrence MBTA station to the north shore), the Duck Bridge (which brings Union Street across the river), and the double-decked O'Reilly Bridge, bringing I-495 across the river.

Lawrence is the western hub of the [[Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority]]'s bus service. It is also home to the Senator Patricia McGovern Transportation Center, home to regional bus service and the [[Lawrence (MBTA station)|Lawrence stop]] along the [[Haverhill/Reading Line]] of the [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] system, providing service from Haverhill to Boston's [[North Station]].  [[Lawrence Municipal Airport (Massachusetts)|Lawrence Municipal Airport]] provides small plane service, though it is actually in neighboring North Andover. Lawrence is approximately equidistant from [[Manchester-Boston Regional Airport]] and [[Logan International Airport]]. Future plans to revitalize the Manchester and Lawrence branch&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nh.gov/dot/org/aerorailtransit/railandtransit/documents/nhstaterailplan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to the north, leading to Manchester, New Hampshire, will allow the MBTA to operate rail service up to Manchester from Lawrence, in conjunction with Pan Am Freights.

==Climate==
Lawrence has a [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen climate classification Dfa), which is typical for the southern [[Merrimack valley]] region in [[eastern Massachusetts]].

Lawrence is one of Essex County's two county seats, along with Salem. As such, it is home to a juvenile, district and superior court, as well as a regional office of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. It is also home to the Lawrence Correctional Alternative Center, a regional alternative jail for low-risk offenders. It is not home to the county's sheriff or district attorney; they are in [[Middleton, Massachusetts|Middleton]] (home to the county's correctional facility) and Salem, respectively. The city is also covered by the Andover barracks of Troop A of the [[Massachusetts State Police]], which serves much of the western Merrimack Valley and several towns just south of Andover.

===Healthcare===
[[Lawrence General Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrencegeneral.org/|title=Welcome|work=lawrencegeneral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the city's main hospital, providing service to much of the area south of the city. Other nearby hospitals are in Methuen, Haverhill and [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]]. The city also is served by the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glfhc.org&lt;/ref&gt;
Guardian Ambulance was established in 1990 and incorporated in 1991 by local EMTs to serve the city during a downturn in the economy at that time. The station moved from the Tower Hill section to its current location on Marston Street in 1993.

==Library==

The [[Lawrence Public Library (Massachusetts)|Lawrence public library]] was established in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;C.B. Tillinghast. ''The free public libraries of Massachusetts. 1st Report of the Free Public Library Commission of Massachusetts''. Boston: Wright &amp; Potter, 1891. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LusKAAAAYAAJ Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawrencefreelibrary.org/about_us.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402173107/http://www.lawrencefreelibrary.org/about_us.htm |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fiscal year 2008, the city of Lawrence spent 0.55% ($1,155,597) of its budget on its public library—some $16 per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mblc.state.ma.us/advisory/statistics/public/repmunicpie/index.php |title=Advisory Services For Libraries - Library Statistics - Public Library Data - |work=state.ma.us |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123010127/http://mblc.state.ma.us/advisory/statistics/public/repmunicpie/index.php |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media and communications ==

Lawrence's main newspaper is ''[[The Eagle-Tribune]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eagletribune.com| title=Eagle-Tribune| work=Eagle-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the major newspapers for the Merrimack Valley that was founded in Lawrence in 1890 but later moved its facilities to the town of North Andover on [[Massachusetts Route 114|Route 114]]. Lawrence is home to [[Rumbo (newspaper)|''Rumbo'']] (a bilingual English/Spanish paper) and ''Siglo 21''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siglo21.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611233631/http://www.siglo21.com/ |date=2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a Spanish paper). Another newspaper closely covering Lawrence news is ''The Valley Patriot'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://valleypatriot.com/| title=The Valley Patriot| work=The Valley Patriot}}&lt;/ref&gt; a monthly paper published in North Andover. The city has three AM stations, [[WNNW]]/800, [[WCAP (AM)|WCAP]]/980, and [[WLLH]]/1400 (which is also dually licensed to Lowell, Massachusetts with a synchronous transmitter in that city); along with one FM station: [[WEEI-FM]]/93.7. [[WMFP]] is the only television station operating out of the city, and the city is considered part of the Boston television market.

Lawrence is served by [[Area codes 978 and 351]]. Originally a part of area code [[Area codes 617 and 857|617]], it became part of area code [[Area codes 508 and 774|508]] in 1988 before that, too, was split, with 978 covering the northern half of the old area code. Area code 351 is considered an [[overlay plan|overlay]] code.

==Economy==
[[New Balance]] has a shoe manufacturing plant in Lawrence, one of five plants operating in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newbalance.com/usa/#/factories| title=New Balance USA Collection - New Balance USA| work=newbalance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charm Sciences, which manufactures test kits and systems for antibiotic, veterinary drugs, mycotoxins, pesticides, alkaline phosphatase, pathogens, end-product microbial assessment, allergen control, and ATP hygiene, has a laboratory in Lawrence.

[[Lawrence General Hospital]], founded in 1875, is located near downtown.

[[File:Bushcraft speervissen.jpg|thumb|A leister used for spearfishing]]
A '''leister''' is a type of [[spear]] used for [[fishing]].

Leisters have been used by [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures throughout the world since the [[Stone Age]] and are still used for fishing by indigenous tribes and cultures today.

'''Life Sciences Foundation (LSF)''' was a San Francisco-based [[nonprofit organization]] that was established in 2011 to collect, preserve, interpret, and promote the history of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phrma_2013"&gt;{{citation |title=Life Sciences Foundation Tells the Story of Biotechnology |date=March 6, 2013|author=Stephanie Fischer |url=http://www.phrma.org/life-sciences-foundation-tells-the-story-of-biotechnology#sthash.1cg0P5hW.dpuf |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |publisher=[[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; LSF conducted historical research,  maintained archives and published  historically relevant materials and information.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012"&gt;{{citation |date=May 1, 2012 |volume=32 |number=9 |title=Telling the Story of Biotechnology: Life Sciences Foundation Formed to Help People Understand Why Biotech History Matters |author=Donna Loc |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/telling-the-story-of-biotechnology/4087/ |publisher=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their public support of climate-science denier Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in 2018 caused a backlash against the foundation and eroded their scientific credibility.

On December 1, 2015, the LSF and the '''Chemical Heritage Foundation''' finalized a merger, creating one organization that covers "the history of the life sciences and biotechnology together with the history of the chemical sciences and engineering."&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/history|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merger"&gt;{{cite news|title=CHF and LSF Announce Merger|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chf-and-lsf-announce-merger-300159747.html|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=PR Newswire|date=Oct 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the '''[[Science History Institute]]''', to reflect its wider range of historical interests, from chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salisbury|first1=Stephan|title=Chemical Heritage Foundation is morphing into the Science History Institute|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/chemical-heritage-foundation-science-history-institute-philadelphia-20180103.html|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization is headquartered in [[Philadelphia]] but retains offices in the San Francisco Bay area.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==Mandate==

The LSF mandate was to collect and promote the history of biotechnology. This includes telling the stories of "scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, managers, executives, and financiers" in order to "humanize" biotechnology to a lay audience.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phrma_2013" /&gt; The history of the biotechnology industry includes examining the complex relationships and socio-political dynamics that occur when science and entrepreneurship come together.&lt;ref name="BIO"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bio.org/node/3423 |publisher= [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]] (BIO) |date=nd |title=Related Organizations &amp; State Affiliates |accessdate=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea for a foundation that would collect and share the history of biotechnology came about at a meeting in early January 2009 in San Francisco attended by G. Steven Burrill of Burrill &amp; Company, [[Dennis Gillings]] of [[Quintiles]] in Durham, NC,, John Lechleiter of [[Eli Lilly &amp; Co.]], [[Henri Termeer]], then CEO of [[Genzyme]] and Arnold Thackray, founding President and CEO of the [[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] (CHF)&lt;ref name="LSF_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LSF_about"&gt;{{citation |url=http://biotechhistory.org/about/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021014715/http://biotechhistory.org/about/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-21 |date=nd |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |title=About |work=Life Sciences Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Five years ago, G. Steven Burrill was part of a small group of biotech leaders who came together to discuss the importance of capturing the great stories and lessons of the biotech pioneers for future generations. From this meeting, the Life Sciences Foundation was formed in 2010.|Life Sciences Foundation 2014}}

Thackray had shaped Chemical Heritage Foundation—"the premier institution preserving the history of chemistry, chemical engineering, and related sciences and technologies." Oral history was one component of the CHF mandate of preserving interpreting, and promoting the history of science.&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COH"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/center-for-oral-history |title=Center for Oral History |work= [[Science History Institute]] |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[American Chemical Society]] had launched the Center for the History of Chemistry which was renamed the Chemical Heritage Foundation (CHF) in 1992.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Thackray, a Fellow of [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Royal Historical Society]] and the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]],&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceHistory_2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/profile/arnold-thackray |title=Arnold Thackray |website= Science History Institute |date=February 16, 2012 |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thackray received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in the history of science from Cambridge University.&lt;ref name="ScienceHistory_2012" /&gt;

Thackray argued that before LSF was founded, the recorded history of biotechnology was "fragmented, uneven, and rather paltry." He observed that, "If you don't write your own history, somebody else will do it for you, and they may be hostile."&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;

{{quote|There is a valuable heritage here. The life sciences will shape the course of the 21st century. We need to preserve their history. We need to teach young people about the world in which they live ... Records are being scattered, memories are fading, stories are disappearing. Once lost, they're gone forever.|Arnold Thackray}}

By the end of 2011, LSF's steering committee of industry leaders— [[Joshua Boger]], Robert Carpenter, Bob Coughlin, [[Henri Termeer]] and Peter Wirth— were promoting the foundation's work by encouraging scientists and industrialists who were members of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, to contribute potential stories and materials to the archival record of the history of biotechnology in Boston and the surrounding region.&lt;ref name="MassBio_2012" /&gt;

== Oral History Program ==

The Life Sciences Foundation conducted [[oral history]] interviews with scientists, entrepreneurs, executives, policy makers, and leaders of thought in the biotechnology industry.&lt;ref name="Phrma_2013" /&gt; LSF's hosts timelines, transcripts and audio recordings and provides links to existing oral histories housed at institutions across the globe.&lt;ref name="MassBio_2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massbio.org/news/248-q_a_with_arnold_thackray_president_ceo_of_the/news_detail |title=Q&amp;A with Arnold Thackray, President &amp; CEO of the Life Sciences Foundation - News - |work=[[Massachusetts Biotechnology Council]] MassBio (MBC) |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111073955/http://www.massbio.org/news/248-q_a_with_arnold_thackray_president_ceo_of_the/news_detail |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archives ==

Original documentary materials pertinent to the history of biotechnology and the life sciences are being collected. The materials include personal papers and correspondence, donated company records, laboratory notebooks, photographs, video and audio recordings. Collected materials will be guided to permanent repositories in appropriate institutional settings.  Electronic reproductions will be made available to scholars, journalists, educators, and the general public in a digital archive.&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/life-sciences-foundation-looks-capture-history-biotech |work=Bioworld |date=February 2, 2012 |author=Morrison, Trista |accessdate= July 19, 2015 |title=Life Sciences Foundation Looks to Capture History of Biotech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

LSF historians work on a range of publications including a quarterly magazine, scholarly articles, white papers, and books. These works are intended for multiple audiences and focused on the emergence and evolution of biotechnologies in pharmaceutical discovery and development, agriculture, energy production, and [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt; In October 2011, the [[University of Chicago Press]] released ''Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech'' by Life Sciences Foundation historian Sally Smith Hughes.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes_2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech |author=Sally Smith Hughes |pages=232 |date=2011 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==

Founding partners of the Life Sciences Foundation include Burrill, [[Celgene]], John Lechleiter, [[Genentech]], Henri Termeer, [[Merck &amp; Co.]], Millennium, [[Pfizer]], [[Quintiles]], and [[Thermo Fisher Scientific|Thermo Fisher]].&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt; [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] professor, [[Phillip Allen Sharp|Phillip Sharp]], serves as LSF's academic advisor.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt; Its executive and advisory board members are leaders from biotech, venture capital, academic institutions and trade associations.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;

When Thackray retired in 2012, Heather R. Erickson, 34, was appointed as LSF President and CEO and member of the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="CEO_2012"&gt;{{citation |title=Life Sciences Foundation Names Heather R.

[[File:Magnetic Drilling Machine from BDS Machinen GmbH, Germany.jpg|alt=Magnetic Core Drilling Machine|thumb|A lightweight magnetic drilling machine using a high-speed steel (HSS) [[annular cutter]] to drill holes in an I-beam]]

A '''magnetic drilling machine''' is a portable drilling machine with a magnetic base (either electromagnetic or permanent magnet). It can use [[twist drill]] bits, [[annular cutter]]s, milling cutters, and other rotary cutters. With suitable bits it can also tap threads, ream, and countersink. Its combination of a stable magnetic base and low RPMs help resist or reduce torque forces created by large diameter bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://magneticdrillingmachines.com/2015/03/13/what-is-a-magnetic-drilling-machine/|title=What is a Magnetic Drilling Machine?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
A portable magnetic drilling machine is faster and more portable alternative to hole making machines such as the drill press, and is more accurate than a hand drill. 

A portable magnetic drilling machine is used on steel or other magnetic materials.  It gives an accuracy of 0.01 mm to 0.05mm in steel or other magnetic materiel. The drill bits used for this machines are generally made from high-speed steel(HSS) or are tungsten carbide tipped(TCT).

=== Base ===
The base of a magnetic drill is equipped with a powerful electromagnet to easily clamp the machine on the work piece to be drilled. When energized this magnet is held on the metal work piece locking the machine base to the surface. The electromagnet plays a very important role in a portable magnetic drill, as it helps the machine to be steady, does not let the machine dismount during drilling, can work with the machine overhead, horizontal or vertical. Generally, a magnetic core drilling machine is used on a ferrous material directly, but it can also be used on no ferrous material like stainless steel with the help of clamping devices.

=== Stand ===
A drill stand is the main body of the magnetic drill where the electric switches for motor and magnet are mounted, magnet indicator is mounted and also the clock-anticlockwise direction switches are mounted. The body of the magnetic drill holds together the motor and the magnet base. The feed handle is also attached to the body. The body of the magnetic drill helps the motor slide on it to get an upward and downward feed. The body of the magnetic drill also plays the role of a handle to lift and move the machine from one place to other. The material used for the body is generally cast iron.

=== Arbor ===
An arbor or chuck on a magnetic drill is attached to the motor. it is a type of clamp used to attach the core drills. There are mainly two types of chuck available for the magnetic drill, industrial arbor (manual tightening) and quick change drill chucks. The quick change drill chucks are easy and fast option to attach the core drills. They do not need to tighten the screws/jaws manually. The arbor or chucks have different types of spindle holder (machine taper) like Morse taper MT 2, MT 3, and MT 4.The BDS MAB 1300 core drilling machine is the only machine in the world with MT 4 tool holder. The chuck allows different types of core drill shafts (shanks) to fit in it.

== Types ==

Popular forms of magnetic drilling machine include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bds-machines.com/Magnetic-Drilling-Machines/en_US|title=Magnetic Drilling Machines|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogen.bds-machines.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=628&amp;action=edit&amp;lang=en|title=Types Of Magnetic Drilling Machines|last=BDS Maschinen GmbH|first=|date=|website=www.bds-machines.com|publisher=BDS Maschinen GmbH|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light weight ===
Very light weight types magnetic drills are very popular to perform several operations where the weight of a machine to carry is a great concern like working on an electric pole, mobile tower, TV tower, Bridges, etc.
=== Automatic and semi-automatic feed ===
Magnetic core drilling machines with fully and semi-automatic drill feed are very popular these days. These machines help in saving time and energy and resulting in more production.

=== Pneumatic ===
Pneumatic core drilling machines are specially used where there is a danger of fire due to electricity. This model used for the more secure purpose. The motor is driven by pneumatic medium and the magnetic is a permanent magnet instead of an electromagnet.

=== Cordless ===
Battery operated magnetic core drilling machines are used for a work place where there is no electricity. The motor is driven by a rechargeable battery. The magnet for these machines is either electromagnet of the permanent magnet. 
=== Horizontal ===
Horizontal magnetic core drilling machines with angular gears are made for confined drilling situations.

== Bits ==
The magnetic core drilling machine utilizes [[core drill]] bits or [[annular cutter]]s. 

With a cutter wall thickness of approximately 5 mm only a small amount of material around the edge of a hole is removed by an annular cutter.&lt;ref name="csunitec"/&gt;  Numerous teeth remain sharper longer than the single pointed tip of a spiral drill. Holes produced are smooth and burr-free - no reaming is required. 

==Operation==
Drilling holes with a magnetic drilling machine is a three-step process:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magneticdrill.org/drilling-deep-holes-annular-cutters/|title=Drilling deep holes with annular cutters|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. The pilot pin accurately centers the cutter over the area to be drilled.

2. During drilling, the pilot pin retracts and allows the internal lubrication to reach the cutting teeth.

3. When the hole is complete, the slug/core is automatically ejected from the cutter, leaving an accurate, finished hole.

High-quality precision-engineered cutters may have tapered inner walls. These hellp offset the effect of frictional heat build-up that causes expansion of both the cutter and waste slug being produced by the cutting action, allowing ready ejection of the slug upon completion.

The '''Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology''' or better known as '''MIGHT''' is an independent non-profit technology think tank under the purview of the [[Prime Minister's Department (Malaysia)|Prime Minister's Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MIGHT presents draft for aerospace industry blueprint |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2014/11/04/might-presents-draft-for-aerosapce-industry-blueprint/|accessdate=23 September 2016|issue=Business News|publisher=The Star|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1993 to support the Science Advisor to the Prime Minister and leverage on the multi-disciplinary and inter-ministerial synergies from both the industry and Government.

MIGHT was tasked to be forward looking, utilizing foresight &amp; futures (then known as prospecting) to help drive the advancement of high technology competency and capacity in Malaysia. A public-private partnership organization in nature, it provides a consensus building platform for collaboration in developing policies and strategic advice to the government.

Through its platform and works, MIGHT gave birth to notable and strategic national initiatives such Malaysia's Formula 1, Kulim High-Tech Park, Malaysian Automotive Institute, Technology Depository Agency and many others. Remaining in the background, MIGHT is known in certain circles to be a "surrogate mother" or the "nation's kitchen crew".

== History ==
Malaysia's emphasis on development of [[Science and technology in Malaysia|science and technology]] (S&amp;T) is nothing new. The government has long initiated active measures to promote and develop techno-business opportunities by harnessing science and technology (S&amp;T). In 1984, under then Prime Minister Dr. [[Mahathir Mohamad]], a Science Advisor’s post was created in the Prime Minister’s Department to create a conducive ecosystem where S&amp;T  and its uptake could flourish. The move is seen as complementary as well as to provide a second opinion to those of the relevant Ministries. Dr. [[Omar Abdul Rahman (academic)|Omar Abdul Rahman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaafar|first1=Johan|title=A giant among men|url=http://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/09/giant-among-men|accessdate=27 September 2016|publisher=New Straits Time|date=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to the post of Science Advisor to the Prime Minister and held the post until he retired in 2001.&lt;br /&gt;
The seed of MIGHT was sown when a Unit under the Office of Science Advisor was created aptly named 'High Technology Special Unit' ''(Unit Khas Teknologi Tinggi)'' . This unit then grew to become what MIGHT is today.&lt;br /&gt;
MIGHT's focus and emphasis has been very dynamic throughout the years but has always been in the areas of high technology and heavy engineering. The focus emphasis was dependent on the maturity of the industry as well as timing of the intervention. Throughout the years, MIGHT focus areas includes but not limited to the following:-

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7554">[[Image:Dioscorea mexicana.jpg|right|200px|thumb| Root of barbasco ''[[Dioscorea mexicana]]'']]
The '''Mexican barbasco trade''' was the trade of the [[diosgenin]]-rich [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] species ''[[Dioscorea mexicana]]'', ''[[Dioscorea floribunda]]'' and ''[[Dioscorea composita]]'' which emerged in Mexico in the 1950s as part of the [[Marker degradation#Mexican steroid industry|Mexican steroid industry]]. The trade consisted in Mexican [[Peasant|campesinos]] harvesting the root in the jungle, selling it to middlemen who brought it to processing plants where the root was fermented and the diosgenin extracted and sold to pharmaceutical companies such as [[Syntex]] who used it to produce [[synthetic hormones]].

==History==

===Scientific discovery of medicinal properties===
The trade started when [[Russell Earl Marker|Russell Marker]], a chemist looking for a plant source from which to extract [[diosgenin]] and [[saponin]], traveled to [[Veracruz]] looking for the yam ''Dioscorea mexicana'' which he suspected might be suitable. He hired two Mexican campesinos to bring him exemplars of the [[tuber]]. When he discovered that the root was indeed a significant source of diosgenin he established Syntex, the first Mexican fine chemical company dedicated to producing [[semisynthetic]] hormones from Barbasco. Before this development, natural hormones were extracted from animal sources, such as urine from pregnant mares or women, or from bull testes; prices were consequently very high. With the development of the process of [[Marker degradation]] which allowed the production of hormones from vegetable [[saponin]] sources, Marker began a search for a plant [[steroid]] of the sapogenin class with a ring structure more like [[progesterone]]. With the discovery of the chemical properties of the barbasco root, world market prices for steroids and other synthetic hormones plummeted – making them feasible for large scale production of medicines for common ailments such as [[arthritis]] or [[Addison's disease]], and eventually as the basis for the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga, "Uncommon trajectories: steroid hormones, Mexican peasants, and the search for a wild yam" ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'' Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences volume 36 (4) 2005 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Hinke. 2008. EL BARBASCO. Ciencias, enero-marzo, número 089. Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Distrito Federal, México. [http://www.journals.unam.mx/index.php/cns/article/download/12134/11456] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The development of the industry===
This development sparked a barbasco extraction industry centered on the barbasco-rich areas of southeastern Mexico, in Northern [[Oaxaca]], Southern [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]] states. Especially the area called [[Chinantla]] in Northern Oaxaca, around the cities of [[Tuxtepec]] and [[San Juan Bautista Valle Nacional|Valle Nacional]]. The root was extracted in the wild by ''barbasqueros'', often poor [[Indigenous people of Mexico|Indigenous]] [[Chinantecs]], who ventured into the jungle to dig out the tuber with digging sticks or with their bare hands. Before becoming used industrially, the tuber was used by [[Chinantec]] healers in northern [[Oaxaca]] as an [[abortifacient]] and in cures for aching joints. It was also used by Chinantecs as a poison for fishing in the [[Papaloapan river]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Soto Laveaga, Gabriela|year=2009|title=Jungle Laboratories: Mexican peasants, National Projects and the Making of the Pill|publisher=Duke University|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1970s 125,000 Mexican peasants depended on the barbasco trade for their livelihood, and ten tons of Barbasco per week were extracted from the wild.&lt;ref name="Soto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Soto Laveaga, Gabriela|year=2009|title=Jungle Laboratories: Mexican peasants, National Projects and the Making of the Pill |publisher=Duke University |pages=37|isbn=9780822346050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRvzw39OccwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quickly a system of middlemen appeared, as those who had enough means to pay ''barbasqueros'', started buying large quantities, often using a system of [[debt peonage]]. They would start by giving the ''barbasquero'' a loan which he or she would then have to pay off with barbasco. These middlemen would eventually establish ''acopios'', recollection and distribution centrals where large quantities of barbasco are gathered and shipped on to the ''beneficios'', the processing plants.&lt;ref name="Sotowholebook"/&gt;

===The production process===
At the processing plants the tuber is inspected, washed and chopped up, and mixed with water to produce a thick paste. The paste is then put into fermentation vats where it remains several days, after which it is taken out and sun dried on a concrete floor where it is turned by workers using rakes. In the process of drying the paste crystallizes into diosgenin granules, also called flour. The flour is then bagged and sent to laboratories where the diosgenin content is measured and the price is calculated based on the diosgenin percentage, which varies from 4–6%.&lt;ref name="Sotowholebook"/&gt;

Knowledge of the uses and purposes of the barbasco tuber was highly stratified and barbasqueros often did not know the true purpose of the root they were gathering: they were frequently told that it was used for soap.&lt;ref name="Sotowholebook"&gt;{{cite book|author=Soto Laveaga, Gabriela|year=2009|title=Jungle Laboratories: Mexican peasants, National Projects and the Making of the Pill |publisher=Duke University |pages=|isbn=9780822346050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRvzw39OccwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acopio owners knew more about the process and eventually invented ways of improving the diosgenin concentration in roots collected by adding different solvents to the tubers before shipping them to the beneficios.

===End of the ''barbasco'' era===
In the late 1970s, populist President [[Luis Echeverría]] sought to organize and nationalize the barbasco trade in order to derive more benefit to the barbasqueros and to the Mexican state. He established the organization PROQUIVEMEX (Productos Químicos Vegetales de México). However, at this point Mexico had lost its status as a world leader of the synthetic hormone market and the barbasco trade was declining, just as the root was becoming depleted in the wild.&lt;ref name="Sotowholebook"/&gt;

Also during the 1970s it became possible to produce steroids from soy [[phytosterols]], including [[Progesterone#Laboratory|progesterone]]. This meant that barbasco was no longer necessary as a base product, and international reliance on Mexican yam stopped. Today only a few communities in Northern Oaxaca continue to produce barbasco, and the few existing beneficios process only a few tons per year. In 1999  65% of families in the municipio of [[Santiago Jocotepec]] depended on barbasco production, whereas in the municipios of [[San Juan Lalana]] it was 29.2%, in [[San Felipe Usila]] 28.3 and in [[San Lucas Ojitlan]] 24.4%.&lt;ref&gt;De Teresa, Ana Paula. 1999.

Due to perceived [[conflict of interest]] and poor regulatory oversight following the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] and [[Office of the Inspector General|Inspector General]] investigations, Secretary of the Interior [[Ken Salazar]] issued a secretarial order on May 19, 2010 splitting MMS into three new federal agencies: the [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management]], the [[Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement]], and the [[Office of Natural Resources Revenue]].&lt;ref name="SO3299"&gt;

==History==
{{further|#Criticism and controversies}}
The Minerals Management Service was created on January 19, 1982.&lt;ref name=mmsoverview/&gt;  In January 1983, Congress passed the [[Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act]] with the stated purpose:&lt;ref name=royaltymngtact1982&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrm.mms.gov/Laws_R_D/PubLaws/PDFDocs/97-451.pdf |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |title=Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 |author=97th United States Congress |authorlink=97th United States Congress |date=January 12, 1983 |work=96 STAT. 2447 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527175653/http://www.mrm.mms.gov/Laws_R_D/PubLaws/PDFDocs/97-451.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=To ensure that all oil and gas originated on the public lands and on the Outer Continental Shelf are properly accounted for under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and for other purposes.}}

The Secretary of the Interior at the time, [[James G. Watt]], designated MMS as the administrative agency responsible for execution of activities under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OCS Lands Act History |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |url=http://www.boemre.gov/aboutBOEMRE/OCSLA/ocslahistory.htm |work=Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420185419/http://www.boemre.gov/aboutBOEMRE/OCSLA/ocslahistory.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passage of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], MMS was given authority to develop renewable energy projects such as wave, wind and current energy on the Outer Continental Shelf.&lt;ref name=mmsoverview/&gt;  As of 2010, the Agency was composed of two operating units, the MRM and OEMM.&lt;ref name=2010budgjust/&gt;
* Offshore Energy and Minerals Management (OEMM) – Under the guidance of the 1953 [[Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act]], the OEMM managed energy and mineral development in over 1.71 billion offshore acres of the [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) and annually disburses to the [[U.S. Treasury]] expected of $5 billion in minerals revenue in 2010.&lt;ref name=2010budgjust/&gt;
* Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) – Through the MRM program, the Agency collected, accounted for, and disbursed mineral revenues from Federal and American Indian leases.
The Agency's offshore renewable energy program included development of renewable energy such as wind, wave, and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since its inception in 1982 through [[Fiscal year#United States|FY]]2008, the Agency had disbursed approximately $200 million to Federal, state, and American Indian accounts.&lt;ref name=2010budgjust/&gt;

On June 21, 2010, the Minerals Management Service was renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement and reorganized.&lt;ref name=BOEMRE/&gt;

==Operations==
As of 2009, the Agency employed about 1,600 people, which was proposed to grow by less than one hundred in 2010.&lt;ref name=2010budgjust/&gt;

===Organization===
The BOEMRE was reorganized in May 2010 under the direction of Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar following the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The bureau is organized into these three newly created agencies:&lt;ref name=BOEMRE/&gt;&lt;ref name=SO3299/&gt;

* [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management]] – Responsible for leasing areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for conventional and renewable energy resources.
* [[Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement]] – Responsible for ensuring comprehensive oversight, safety, and environmental protection in all offshore energy activities.
* [[Office of Natural Resources Revenue]] – Responsible for royalty and revenue management, including collection and distribution of revenue, auditing and compliance, and asset management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-oil-spill-20100520,0,710625.story Interior secretary orders division of federal oil regulator ([[Los Angeles Times]], May 19, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to at least 2002, drilling for oil and gas on federal lands and waters produced the second largest source of revenue for the federal government other than taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=July 2004 |format=PDF |publisher=United States Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, Gulf of Mexico OCS Region |location=[[New Orleans]] |title=Interim Report on the History of the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry in Southern Louisiana |url=http://www.gomr.boemre.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/studies/2004/2004-049.pdf |page=30 |author=Diane Austin |author2=Bob Carriker |author3=Tom McGuire |author4=Joseph Pratt |author5=Tyler Priest |author6=Allan G.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other contributing factors to the placing the accuracy of revenue streams at risk were insufficiently trained personnel and insufficient numbers of personnel working in the RIK program and a lack of standard reporting method by industry members, leading to manual rather than computer-based processing of more than half of the data required for RIK data inputs.&lt;ref name=GAO09744/&gt;

Citing its scandals and the persistent incapacity of the RIK program to fulfill its statutory obligations, Interior Secretary Salazar announced in September 2009 that the RIK program would be shut down.  Due to existing lease contracts with RIK provisions, the program as of 2010 is still winding down.&lt;ref name=bloom2009-09-16/&gt;  On October 7, 2009, the U.S. House Oversight Committee reported the loss of billions in revenue resulting from MMS mismanagement and cozy relationships with industry officials.&lt;ref name=wapo529/&gt; According to [[Darrell Issa]], the top Republican on the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]], there may be a conflict of interest for the Minerals Management Service to collect revenue and also oversee safety.

=== Gifts, gratuities and the revolving door ===
In September 2008, reports by the Inspector General of the Interior Department, [[Earl E. Devaney]], were released that implicated over a dozen officials of the MMS of unethical and criminal conduct in the performance of their duties. The investigation found MMS employees had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sex with energy company representatives. MMS staff had also accepted gifts and free holidays amid "a culture of ethical failure", according to the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/10/AR2008091001829.html |title=Report Says Oil Agency Ran Amok: Interior Dept.

A May 2010 inspector general investigation revealed that MMS regulators in the Gulf region had allowed industry officials to fill in their own inspection reports in pencil and then turned them over to the regulators, who traced over them in pen before submitting the reports to the agency.

The [[Project On Government Oversight]] (POGO) alleges that MMS has suffered from a systemic [[revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] problem between the Department of Interior and the oil and gas industries.  For example, thirteen months after departing as MMS director, Bush appointee [[Randall Luthi]] became president of the [[National Oceans Industries Association]] (NOIA) whose mission is "to secure reliable access and a favorable regulatory and economic environment for the companies that develop the nation's valuable offshore energy resources in an environmentally responsible manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.noia.org/website/article.asp?id=7|title=NOIA home page|publisher=National Oceans Industries Association|accessdate=2010-05-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511205832/http://www.noia.org/website/article.asp?id=7|archivedate=May 11, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Luthi succeeded Tom Fry, who was MMS director under the Clinton administration.

On May 11, 2010, in response to the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]],  Secretary of the Interior [[Ken Salazar]] announced that MMS would be restructured so that the safety and environmental functions are carried out by a unit with full independence from MMS in order to ensure that federal inspectors will have more tools, resources, and greater authority to enforce laws and regulations that apply to oil and gas companies operating on the Outer Continental Shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Salazar Launches Safety and Environmental Protection Reforms to Toughen Oversight of Offshore Oil and Gas Operations|publisher=Department of the Interior|date=May 11, 2010|url=http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Salazar-Launches-Safety-and-Environmental-Protection-Reforms-to-Toughen-Oversight-of-Offshore-Oil-and-Gas-Operations.cfm|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another outcome of the spill was the retirement of the associate director for offshore energy and minerals management at the time of the spill, [[Chris Oynes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/17/AR2010051702123.html?hpid=topnews Independent probe of BP oil spill in works]&lt;/ref&gt;

MMS's regulatory decisions contributing to the 2010 oil spill included, in negligence, the decision that an acoustically controlled shut-off valve ([[Blowout preventer|BOP]]) would not be required as a last resort against underwater spills at the site,&lt;ref name="hous1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/deepwaterhorizon/6996736.html|title= Critics blame energy lobby for lax safety rules|author=Richard S.

On May 19, 2010 Salazar announced that MMS will be broken up into three separate divisions, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which will separately oversee energy leasing, safety enforcement, and revenue collection.&lt;ref name="SO3299"/&gt;

'''Nariman Point''' is a business district in [[Downtown]] [[Mumbai]]. Formerly the [[Central business district|prominent business district]] on India's west coast, Nariman Point yielded that status to Mumbai's [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{citation|author={{null|&lt;!--not given--&gt;}}|title=Why Nariman Point is running on empty|periodical=Mumbai Mirror (online edition)|date=17 December 2012|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/articleshow/17863545.cms?pageno=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Nariman Point's development, Mumbai's business centre was at [[Ballard Estate]],&lt;ref name="MM" /&gt; which {{ndash}} like Nariman Point also {{ndash}} was built on land reclaimed from the sea.

Located on the southern tip of the Mumbai peninsula, at the end of the Mumbai's [[Marine Drive, Mumbai|Marine Drive]], Nariman Point is named after [[Khurshed Nariman|Khursheed Framji Nariman]], a municipal corporator who had initiated the area's development as an extension to the [[Back Bay (Mumbai)|Back Bay]] reclamation. Nariman Point houses some of [[India]]'s prestigious business headquarters, and despite its decline (see [[#History|below]]), it remains one of the more expensive business districts in India, exceeded only by [[Delhi]]'s [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]] and {{ndash}} since April 2012 {{ndash}} by Mumbai's own [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]].&lt;ref name="Chadha"&gt;{{citation|last=Chadha|first=Sunainaa|date=21 December 2012|title=The slow but steady death of Nariman Point|periodical=First Post|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/economy/the-slow-but-steady-death-of-nariman-point-562877.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1940, the area was part of the Arabian sea. A popular leader of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], [[Khurshed Nariman]] (affectionately called ''Veer'' Nariman), a [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation|Bombay Municipal Corporation]] corporator, proposed to reclaim the area from the sea near [[Churchgate]]. To accomplish this task, the shallow seafront was filled with debris from various parts of the city. Reinforced concrete cement was also used, the steel for which had to be purchased on the black market at higher prices due to [[World War II]].The entire cost was estimated to be  {{abbr|{{INR}}300,000|equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{#expr:((300000 / 13.33)+50) round trunc-2}}}} or ${{formatnum:{{#expr:((300000*4.03 / 13.33)+50) round trunc-2}}}} in 1940}} (equivalent to about {{abbr|
{{INR}}{{format price|{{#expr:{{inflation|US|{{#expr:(300000*4.03 / 13.33)}}|1940}}/{{INRConvert/CurrentRate|USD}}}} }}|around £{{format price|{{inflation|UK|{{#expr:(300000 / 13.33)}}|1940}}}} or ${{format price|{{inflation|US|{{#expr:(300000*4.03 / 13.33)}}|1940}}}} or {{Euro}}{{format price|{{#expr:{{inflation|UK|{{#expr:(300000 / 13.33)}}|1940}}/{{INRConvert/CurrentRate|GBP}}*{{INRConvert/CurrentRate|EUR}}}}}} |}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). Additional reclamations were carried out in the 1970s. A construction boom in that decade also led to the development of commercial high-rises in the area.

In 2006, prior to the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], Nariman point was the 7th most expensive location in the world for office space.&lt;ref name="Chadha"/&gt; However, by December 2012 Nariman Point had fallen to 25th place while Delhi's [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]] remained the 5th most expensive location despite many offices moving to [[Gurgaon]] and [[Noida]].&lt;ref name="Chadha" /&gt; During the same period, Nariman Point also dropped from 7th to 15th most expensive location for office rentals.&lt;ref name="TNN"&gt;{{citation|title=Nariman Point drops 7 places to 15th spot in global office rentals|date=22 February 2012|periodical=Times News Network|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-22/mumbai/31086386_1_expensive-office-location-mumbai-s-cbd-rentals}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the decline were the high prices, lower quality and age of construction, and increasing distances from residential hubs which have now moved northwards and to the suburbs.&lt;ref name="TNN" /&gt; In the first three quarters of 2012, Nariman Point had a vacancy rate of almost 25%, compared with 18% in the rest of the Mumbai city.&lt;ref name="MM" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4245">'''Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology''' (ORSORT) was the successor of the school known locally as the Clinch College of Nuclear Knowledge, later shorten to Clinch College. ORSORT was authorized and financed by the U.S. government and founded in 1950 by Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]] and [[Alvin Weinberg]]. During its existence, the school was the only educational venue in the U.S. from where a comprehensive twelve-month education and training in either "Reactor Hazards Analysis" or "Reactor Operations" could be obtained, with accompanying certificates. Funding ended and the school was closed in 1965, shortly after authorization was extended to select U.S. universities to develop their own Nuclear Engineering curricula. Housed at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], this unique venue and its renowned instructors offered its students the highest level of education of practical applications of atomic energy available at the time, and first-hand exposure to a variety of nuclear reactor designs including the legendary first graphite reactor, pool reactor, high temperature gas reactor, molten salt reactor, fast reactor and high flux reactor.  

The school was made known first nationally and eventually worldwide to U.S. enterprises and to U.S. allies involved in the development of peaceful uses of atomic energy, and who were interested in educating and training designated scientific and engineering personnel at its unique venue.  In 1959, ORSORT accepted its first international enrollments.  Applications to enroll required strict clearance from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]. Tuition fees partially offset school operating costs.  Courses listed in their 1965 curricula included Analysis, Chemical Technology, Economics of Nuclear Power, Engineering Science, Experimental Physics, Nuclear Systems Laboratory, Hazards Study, Health Physics, Instrumentation and Controls, Materials, Mathematics, Meteorology, Physics, Reactor Operating Experience and Shielding. Scientific and engineering graduates of the one-year program earned certificates of completion and were awarded the degree of Doctor of Pile Engineering (D.O.P.E.). ORSORT turned out up to 100 graduates a year, many of whom became leaders in the nuclear industry, such as a former [[Secretary of Energy]], [[James D. Watkins]].  The total number of ORSORT graduates was 976. In addition to 19 US students from the Atomic Energy Commission, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and US utilities, the last graduating class of 1965 included engineering and scientific personnel sponsored by their governments in Australia, India, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology: Model for university nuclear engineering courses |date= 2016-10-04 |url= http://www.oakridger.com/news/20161004/oak-ridge-school-of-reactor-technology-model-for-university-nuclear-engineering-courses }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research''' (PCSIR) is a government-owned science and industrialisation research organisation which mainly focuses on the development of industrial research. Initially established as Pakistan Department of Research in 1951, it was reformulated in its current state in 1953.&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1050186|title=Salimuzzaman Siddiqui &amp;ndash; A visionary of science|publisher=Dawn (newspaper)|author=Suhail Yusuf|date=18 October 2013|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCSIR was established by [[Salimuzzaman Siddiqui|Prof. Dr. Salimuzzaman Siddiqui]] in 1953 for the development of scientific and technical Research and Development and to provide infrastructure for industrial development in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; The organisation was founded under the Societies Act to promote the cause of Science and Technology in the country. Since 1973, it has functioned under the Act of Parliament. The organisation was under control of Pakistan's [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|Ministry of Science and Technology]], and was given autonomous control in 1984.

As of today,{{when|date=April 2018}} the PCSIR has several geographically dispersed research centres. including four regional offices in each of the provincial capitals, with the head office in [[Islamabad]]. There are eleven laboratories and units and five HRD{{clarify|what is HRD?|date=April 2018}} centres established throughout the country, headed by [[director general]]s or directors who directly report to the [[chairman]]. The chairman of PCSIR is appointed by the [[Government of Pakistan]]. There are 150 officers and technical staff in the head office, including seven directors working in different divisions and departments. There are 681 scientists, engineers, and technologists working in different laboratories, of whom eighty have Ph.D. degrees and others have M.Sc./MS/M.Phil./B.E. degrees in multidisciplinary fields. They are supported by 1,656 technical and skilled staff and 178 administrative staff.

==Testing for consumer safety==
In January 2017, the council conducted tests on 16 brands of [[Packaged|packaged]] [[Milk|milk]] in the interest of public safety and found that only 6 of 16 brands were safe for public consumption. This report was presented to the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1311792 Only six milk brands fit for consumption in Pakistan] Dawn (newspaper), Updated 31 January 2017, Retrieved 13 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PLATH GmbH''' is a German company specialising in [[military]] radio monitoring and [[radiolocation]], active internationally and with headquarters in [[Hamburg]].

==Overview==
The company specialises in [[communication intelligence]] for tactical (COMMS ESM) and strategic applications ([[COMINT]]) on the one hand, as well as applications for maritime routing and [[search and rescue]] support on the other. With its products and systems, and in association with various subsidiaries, PLATH GmbH covers the entire process chain for [[communication intelligence]], from sensor systems to analysis and the evaluation of mass data. PLATH GmbH has ca. 180 employees and achieved revenues of €45 million in the 2016 business year. In 2009 PLATH GmbH was both ranked 49th.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/unternehmen_00000052/weltmeister/seite.aspx ''100 Wachstums-Champions im Mittelstand.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826080010/http://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/unternehmen_00000052/weltmeister/seite.aspx |date=2010-08-26 }} on vdi-nachrichten.com, retrieved 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst the hundred global market leaders, as well as being named ‘Hidden Champion’ by VDI Nachrichten.

==History==
In 1837 David Filby, an instrument-maker from Husum, founded a trading house for nautical instruments and maps, which was acquired in 1862 by Hamburg citizen Carl Christian Plath. Further reorganisations and investment followed, for example in the company Cassens &amp; Bennecke, which, operating from 1909 under the name Cassens &amp; Plath, was engaged in the sale of navigation devices in Bremerhaven, or Weems und Plath in Annapolis, USA, until C. Plath KG was founded in 1939. In 1950 C. Plath KG set up a department for the development of [[radio navigation]] in its so-called Compass House,&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/entry/propaganda_schlachtschiff/33349/maritimes_hamburg.html?o=position-ASCENDING&amp;s=0&amp;r=24&amp;a=4662&amp;of=2&amp;c=1 Photo of Compass House] on einestages.spiegel.de&lt;/ref&gt; a symbol of the port of Hamburg for decades. This department was headed by Maximilian Wächtler, regarded as a pioneer in radiolocation and radio and remote intelligence (recipient of the [[Rudolf-Diesel-Medaille]]), holding more than sixty patents in this field.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Horstmann (Hrsg.): ''Funkpeilen gestern, heute, morgen.'' Maximilian Wächtler 80 Jahre, 2nd edition, Hamburg 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the incorporation of parts of the signalling company founded in Kiel in 1911, this department eventually became C. Plath GmbH – what is now PLATH GmbH. The PLATH group now encompasses PLATH and its subsidiaries innoSysTec, PROCITEC, PLATH EFT and PLATH AG. The group is now majority-owned by the Handelsgesellschaft Scharfe mbH &amp; Co. KG family business.

C. Plath KG, on the other hand, became part of LITEF GmbH, now known as Northrop Grumman LITEF. Due to its origins and the many similar-sounding names, PLATH GmbH is often wrongly regarded as the successor of C. Plath KG and associated with compasses and other navigation devices. Previous managing directors of C. Plath GmbH included Mr. Pfaff, who was CEO from 1989 to 1997 and who, together with Oberst and D. Grabau, wrote some of the basic literature on communication intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Grabau, Klaus Pfaff (Hrsg.): ''Funkpeiltechnik.'' Franckh’sche Verlagshandlung, Stuttgart 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and which is still used today in the training of the German Bundeswehr’s [[electronic warfare]] section and are standard intelligence literature.

==Product lines==
PLATH GmbH is renowned primarily for the production of visual direction finders for navigation and the location of ships in maritime emergencies. In the days before GPS was invented, these devices were vital for finding one’s position in maritime navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seefunknetz.de/peilen.htm ''Funknavigation: Peilen.''] on seefunknetz.de&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Telefunken/DEBEG, who utilised components manufactured by PLATH, PLATH GmbH dominated direction-finding technology field in the 1950s and ‘60s.&lt;ref name="Beckh"&gt;Joachim Beckh: ''Blitz und Anker.'' Band 2: ''Informationstechnik, Geschichte &amp; Hintergründe.'' Norderstedt 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This dominance in the market was so great that radio direction-finding was explained in terms of the SFP7000 in the standard manual for maritime officers&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Krauß: ''Handbuch für die Schiffsführung.'' Band 1, Teil C – ''Navigation.'' 8th edition, Berlin 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''psychology of programming''' ('''PoP''') is the field of research that deals with the [[psychological]] aspects of writing [[Computer program|program]]s (often [[computer]] programs). The field has also been called the '''''empirical studies of programming''''' ('''ESP'''). It covers research into computer programmers' cognition; tools and methods for programming-related activities; and programming education.

Psychologically, computer programming is a human activity which involves [[cognition]]s such as [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]] [[computer language]], [[learning]], [[problem solving]], and [[reasoning]].

==History==
The history of psychology of programming dates back to late 1970s and early 1980s, when researchers realized that computational power should not be the only thing to be evaluated in programming tools and technologies, but also the usability from the users.&lt;ref&gt;Jorma Sajaniemi. Psychology of Programming: Looking into Programmers’ Heads. Human Technology [Internet]. 2008 May 4–8 [cited 2012 Oct 4]; 4(1): Available from: http://www.humantechnology.jyu.fi/articles/volume4/2008/ge-sajaniemi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the first Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers, [[Ben Shneiderman]] listed several important destinations for researchers. These destinations include refining the use of current languages, improving present and future languages, developing special purpose languages, and improving tools and methods. Two important workshop series have been devoted to psychology of programming in the last two decades: the Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers (ESP), based primarily in the US, and the Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop (PPIG), having a European character. ESP has a broader scope than pure psychology in programming, and on the other hand, PPIG is more focused in the field of PoP. However, PPIG workshops and the organization PPIG itself is informal in nature, It is group of people who are interested in PoP that comes together and publish their discussions.

==Goals and purposes==
It is desirable to achieve a programming performance such that creating a program meets its specifications, is on schedule, is adaptable for the future and runs efficiently.&lt;ref name="weinberg"&gt;{{Citation |last=Weinberg |first=Gerald M. |authorlink=Gerald Weinberg |title=The Psychology of Computer Programming |place=New York |publisher=Dorset House |year=1998 |edition=Silver |url=https://leanpub.com/thepsychologyofcomputerprogramming |isbn=0-932633-42-0 |format=&lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:Weinberg+intitle:The+Psychology+of+Computer+Programming]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to satisfy all these goals at a low cost is a difficult and common problem in software engineering and project management. By understanding the psychological aspects of computer programming, we can better understand how to achieve a higher programming performance, and to assist programmers to produce better software with less error.

==Research methods==
Some methods which one can use to study the psychological aspects of computer programming include [[introspection]], [[observation]], [[experiment]], and [[qualitative research]].&lt;ref name="weinberg"/&gt;

A '''stamp mill''' (or '''stamp battery''' or '''stamping mill''') is a type of mill machine that crushes material by pounding rather than grinding, either for further processing or for extraction of metallic ores. Breaking material down is a type of [[unit operation]].

==Description==
[[Image:StampMillDetail5730.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of Californian stamp showing offset cam and rotating lifter]]
[[File:Grabill - Clean Up day at the Deadwood Terra Gold Stamp Mill.jpg|220px|thumb|Interior of the Deadwood Terra Gold Stamp Mill]]

A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy [[steel]] ([[iron]]-shod [[wood]] in some cases) stamps, loosely held vertically in a frame, in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by [[cam]]s on a horizontal rotating [[camshaft|shaft]].  As the cam moves from under the stamp, the stamp falls onto the ore below, crushing the rock, and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

Each one frame and stamp set is sometimes called a "battery" or, confusingly, a "stamp" and mills are sometimes categorised by how many stamps they have, i.e. a "10 stamp mill" has 10 sets. They usually are arranged linearly, but when a mill is enlarged, a new line of them may be constructed rather than extending the line. Abandoned mill sites (as documented by [[Industrial archaeology|industrial archaeologists]]) will usually have linear rows of foundation sets as their most prominent visible feature as the overall apparatus can exceed 20 feet in height, requiring large foundations. Stamps are usually arranged in sets of five.

Some ore processing applications used large quantities of water so some stamp mills are located near natural or artificial bodies of water. For example, the [[Redridge Steel Dam]] was built to supply stamp mills with process water.

==History==
The main components for water-powered stamp mills&amp;nbsp;– [[water wheel]]s, [[cam]]s, and hammers&amp;nbsp;– were known in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic era]] [[Eastern Mediterranean]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ancient history|Ancient]] cams are in evidence in early water-powered [[Automaton|automata]] from the third century BC.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p.16"/&gt; A passage in the ''[[Natural History]]'' of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] scholar [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (NH 18.23) indicates that water-driven pestles had become fairly widespread in Italy by the first century AD: "The greater part of Italy uses an unshod pestle and also wheels which water turns as it flows past, and a trip-hammer [mola]".&lt;ref name="Wilson, p.16"&gt;Wilson, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; These trip-hammers were used for the pounding and hulling of [[grain]].&lt;ref name="Wilson, p.16"/&gt; Grain-pounders with pestles, as well as ordinary [[watermill]]s, are also attested as late as the middle of the fifth century in a [[monastery]] founded by [[Romanus of Condat]] in the remote [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] region, indicating that the knowledge of trip hammers continued into the early [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Wilson, p.16"/&gt; Apart from agricultural processing, archaeological evidence also strongly suggests the existence of trip hammers in Roman metal working. In [[Ickham]] in [[Kent]], a large metal hammer-head with mechanical deformations was excavated in an area where several Roman water-mills and metal waste dumps have also been traced.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p.16"/&gt;

The widest application of stamp mills, however, seems to have occurred in Roman mining, where [[ore]] from deep veins was first crushed into small pieces for further processing.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p.21f."/&gt; Here, the regularity and spacing of large indentations on stone [[anvil]]s indicate the use of cam-operated ore stamps, much like the devices of later [[Middle Ages|medieval]] mining.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p.21f."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry C. Burnham, p.333-335"&gt;Barry C.

Stamp mills were used by [[Mining|miners]] in [[Samarkand]] as early as 973. They were used in [[medieval]] [[Persia]] to crush mineral [[ore]]s. By the 11th century, stamp mills were in widespread use throughout the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], from [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and North Africa in the west to [[Central Asia]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Robert Lucas (2005), "Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe", ''Technology and Culture'' '''46''' (1): 1-30 [10-1 &amp; 27]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gal gromadzenie urobku.jpg|thumb|right|Ore stamp mill in [[Georg Agricola]]'s [[De re metallica]] (1556)]]
Water-powered and mechanised trip hammers reappeared in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] by the 12th century. Their use was described in medieval written sources of [[Styria]] (in modern-day Austria), written in 1135 and another in 1175 AD. Both texts mentioned the use of vertical stamp mills for ore-crushing. Medieval French sources of the years 1116 and 1249 both record the use of mechanised trip hammers used in the forging of [[wrought iron]].&lt;ref name=n379&gt;Needham, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval European trip hammers by the 15th century were most often in the shape of the vertical pestle stamp-mill.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, p.394&lt;/ref&gt; The well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]] often sketched trip hammers for use in forges and even file-cutting machinery, those of the vertical pestle stamp-mill type. The oldest depicted European illustration of a ''martinet'' forge-hammer is perhaps the [[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]] of [[Olaus Magnus]], dated to 1565 AD. In this woodcut image, there is the scene of three martinets and a waterwheel working wood and leather bellows of an osmund ([[:sv:Osmund|sv]]) [[bloomery]] furnace. The recumbent [[trip hammer]] was first depicted in European artwork in an illustration by [[Joachim von Sandrart|Sandrart]] and [[Vittorio Zonca|Zonca]] (dated 1621 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Needham, p.395&lt;/ref&gt;

Water-powered stamp mills are illustrated in book 8 of [[Georg Agricola]]'s [[De Re Metallica]], published in 1556.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Agricola]], ''[[De Re Metallica]]'', 1556, pages [http://nausikaa2.rz-berlin.mpg.de/digitallibrary/digilib.jsp?/permanent/archimedes_repository/large/agric_remet_001_la_1556/001-01-pageimg+230 220], [http://nausikaa2.rz-berlin.mpg.de/digitallibrary/digilib.jsp?/permanent/archimedes_repository/large/agric_remet_001_la_1556/001-01-pageimg+231 221], [http://nausikaa2.rz-berlin.mpg.de/digitallibrary/digilib.jsp?/permanent/archimedes_repository/large/agric_remet_001_la_1556/001-01-pageimg+232 222], [http://nausikaa2.rz-berlin.mpg.de/digitallibrary/digilib.jsp?/permanent/archimedes_repository/large/agric_remet_001_la_1556/001-01-pageimg+233 223], [http://nausikaa2.rz-berlin.mpg.de/digitallibrary/digilib.jsp?/permanent/archimedes_repository/large/agric_remet_001_la_1556/001-01-pageimg+257 247], [http://nausikaa2.rz-berlin.mpg.de/digitallibrary/digilib.jsp?/permanent/archimedes_repository/large/agric_remet_001_la_1556/001-01-pageimg+258 248], [http://nausikaa2.rz-berlin.mpg.de/digitallibrary/digilib.jsp?/permanent/archimedes_repository/large/agric_remet_001_la_1556/001-01-pageimg+264 254], [http://nausikaa2.rz-berlin.mpg.de/digitallibrary/digilib.jsp?/permanent/archimedes_repository/large/agric_remet_001_la_1556/001-01-pageimg+265 255]&lt;/ref&gt;  The mills Agricola shows were largely wooden construction, excepting the use of [[iron]] shoes on the end of each stamp.  The [[camshaft]] was set directly on the [[axle]] of the [[waterwheel]], and stamps were typically arranged in gangs of three, with each wheel driving one or two gangs.

===19th century===
The first stamp mill in the U.S. was built in 1829 at the Capps mine near [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.priweb.org/ed/TFGuide/SE/se_minerals/se_minerals_pdfs/semin_brpied.pdf Mineral Resources of the Blue Ridge and Piedmont] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311172511/http://www.priweb.org/ed/TFGuide/SE/se_minerals/se_minerals_pdfs/semin_brpied.pdf |date=2005-03-11 }}, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; They were common in [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[copper]] mining regions of the US in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries, in operations where the ore was crushed as a prelude to extracting the metals.  They were superseded in the second half of the 19th century in many applications by more efficient methods. However their simplicity meant that they were used in remote areas for ore processing well into the 20th century (19th century advertisements for some mills highlighted that they could be broken down, packed in by mule in pieces, and assembled on site with only simple tools).  Stamp mills are still in use in Colombia by artisanal miners, powered by electric motors.

'''Cornish stamps''' are stamp mills that were developed in [[Cornwall]] for use in [[tin]] mining in around 1850. Cornish stamps were used to crush small lumps of [[ore]] into sand-like material. Constructed from heavy timber or iron lifters with iron "heads" at the bottom were raised by [[cam]]s on a rotating axle, and fell on the ore and water mixture, fed into a box beneath.  The heads normally weighed between 4 and 8 [[Hundredweight|cwt]] &lt;!-- of 112 lb: vagueness of size is intentional. --&gt; (about 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;kg) each, and were usually arranged in sets of four, in timber frames.  Small stamps were commonly powered by [[water wheel]]s and larger ones by steam engines.

'''Californian stamps''' were based on Cornish stamps and were used in the [[California]]n gold mines. In these stamps the cam is arranged to lift the stamp from the side, so that it causes the stamp to rotate. This evens the wear on the shoe at the foot of the stamp. They were more rapid in action and a single head could crush 1.5 tons of ore as opposed to the Cornish stamps which could only crush 1 ton.{{clarify|reason=How often? - per minute/hour/day/week...?|date=October 2015}}

Stamp mills were used in early [[Paper|paper making]] for preparing the paper-stuff ([[Pulp (paper)|pulp]]), before the invention of the [[Hollander beater]], and might have derived from those used in [[fulling]] wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11118">'''Treethanol''' is an [[ethanol fuel]] (more precisely [[cellulosic ethanol]]) made from trees.&lt;ref name="Bacon"/&gt;

== Summary ==
The biofuel is a contender in the race to find an energy alternative to fossil fuels.  Proponents of Treethanol claim that its energy yield is higher compared to the energy required for production when compared with more common sources of ethanol i.e. sugar cane and corn.&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoover |first=F |last2=Abraham |first2=J |title=A comparison of corn-based ethanol with cellulosic ethanol as replacements for petroleum-based fuels: a review |journal=International Journal of Sustainable Energy |year=2009 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=171–182 |doi=10.1080/14786450903056370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Cellulosic ethanol is produced using the [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulose biomass]] that comprises much of the mass of plants.&lt;ref name=Biello&gt;{{cite journal |last=Biello |first=D |title=The False Promise of Biofuels |journal=Scientific American |year=2011 |volume=305 |issue=2 |pages=58–65 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0811-58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially at the core of the plant material is cellulose, which can be broken down into simple carbohydrate sugars.  After these sugars have been extracted, they can be then be fermented into an alcohol, which is known as [[ethanol]].&lt;ref name="Biello"/&gt; The most widely used and promising means of creating cellulosic ethanol is called the [[Cellulolysis|cellulolysis process]]. The process consists of hydrolysis on pretreated lignocellulosic materials.  Then enzymes are used to break down cellulose into glucose. This glucose is then fermented and distilled.&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt; The pretreatment step mentioned above is necessary when processing cellulosic ethanol because the glucose (sugars) are not readily accessible as they are with other ethanol sources such as corn or sugar cane.  Rather, the cellulose in wood must be separated from the encapsulating [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]].

There are three types of pretreatment: physical, chemical, and biological.  Physical treatment involves physically reducing wood particle size. This can be accomplished through chipping, grinding, etc.  Biological treatments involve the use of microorganisms to break down the wood. This type is considered favorable to physical pretreatments because it consumes far less energy in comparison, but the biological method has not proven to be scalable to an industrial level. The chemical method utilizes an alkaline or otherwise acidic medium to make the cellulose within wood fibers more accessible. This has shown to be the most efficient and has the lowest energy cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gonzales |first=R |last2=Treasure |first2=T |title=Economics of Cellulosic Ethanol Production: Green Liquor Pretreatment for Softwood and Hardwood, Greenfield and Repurpose Scenarios |journal=Bioresources |year=2011 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=2551–2567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest trees make up more than 90% of the total terrestrial [[biomass]] while performing functions such as [[carbon sequestration]], producing oxygen, and promoting biodiversity. Trees are a promising source of ethanol because they grow all year round, require significantly less [[fertilizer]] and water and contain far more [[carbohydrates]] (the chemical precursors of ethanol) than [[food crop]]s (like corn) do.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== Sources ==
Poplar, Willow, and Eucalyptus tree are emerging as favorites in the process of creating Treethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Demonstration for Integrated Production of Bioethanol |journal=Chemical Engineering |year=2012 |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to their ability to grow at a fast rate in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Papini"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papini |first=A. |last2=Simeone |first2=M |title=Forest resources for second-generation biofuel production |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research |year=2010 |volume=25 |pages=126–133 |doi=10.1080/02827581.2010.485827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Treethanol is not an energy source that promises to power houses in the future, but rather it can be taken advantage of in applications where combustion engines are used. Approximately 85% of US energy consumption is produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal, and oil. With China, India, and other rapidly developing nations increasing their demand for fossil fuels, the world’s total energy use is expected to grow by 57% over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt; It is estimated that the U.S. alone uses 140 billion gallons of fuel per year for transportation alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weeks |first=Jennifer |title=Not quite, but cellulosic ethanol may be coming sooner than you think |url=http://grist.org/article/weeks1/ |work=[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]] |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only can Treethanol be mixed with ordinary fuels, it can also be burned directly in modified engines to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt;

== Advantages == 
Cellulosic ethanol is an environmentally friendly and renewable transportation fuel that can be produced from forest biomass. Trees are a particularly promising feedstock because they grow all year round, require vastly less fertiliser and water and contain far more carbohydrates (the chemical precursors of ethanol) than food crops do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bacon|first=Derek|title=Woodstock revisited: Could new techniques for producing ethanol make old-fashioned trees the biofuel of the future?|url=http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:g81oTQmfoS8J:scholar.google.com/+treethanol&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,24|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, compared to corn ethanol, cellulosic biofuel does not require the same quantity of fertilizers, pesticides, energy, or water to grow.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.seco.cpa.state.tx.us/energy-sources/biomass/ethanol.php
|title=Ethanol
|publisher=Texas State Energy Conservation Office
|accessdate=2013-01-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important attribute of this type of ethanol is, like all types of ethanol, it is renewable. If you want or need to make more of it, you just grow more trees.&lt;ref name="Bacon"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bacon |first=Derek |title=Woodstock Revisited |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8766061 |work=[[The Economist]] |accessdate=2013-01-29 |date=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of all types of biofuel, including Treethanol can be of importance for countries looking to decrease their dependence on petroleum, especially those countries that import most of their petroleum and also have plenty of crop/forest land such as New Zealand and Sweden.&lt;ref name="Bacon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Sachs |first=Ignacy |title=The Biofuels Controversy |url=http://www.globalbioenergy.org/uploads/media/0711_UNCTAD_-_The_biofuels_controversy.pdf |format=pdf |conference=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development November 2007 |year=2007 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important issue is whether Treethanol is a superior alternative to more common forms of ethanol like corn based.  The general consensus in an article by Hoover, F., &amp; Abraham, J. (2009), is that most forms of cellulosic ethanol have the potential to yield higher energy outputs and be more sustainable than corn ethanol.  They also note that while cellulosic ethanol does not necessarily yield more energy than say, corn based ethanol per unit of measurement, it requires far less energy inputs to produce which could give it a far higher net energy yield at the end of processing. The findings that lignocellulosic biomass has a far greater productivity yield than traditional biofuel sources is supported by Papini, A., &amp; Simeone, M. (2010).

Responsible [[forestry]] practices do not contribute to greenhouse gases because the forest is allowed to regenerate following [[fiber]] harvesting.  For this reason wood can be considered to be an essentially carbon-neutral source of energy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== Drawbacks ==
While it seems reasonable that Treethanol could be an alternative to current ethanol types, it has one flaw, which is the extra processing needed to break down the tough cellulose and hemicellulose within the walls of the cell to isolate the sugars.&lt;ref name="Bacon"/&gt;  As discussed above in the production section, creating ethanol from the lignocellulose found in tree biomass requires the extra step of “pre-treatment”. It is this pre-treatment that still requires too much energy to make the Treethanol worth the effort.

That being said, many believe that the potential pros far out-weigh the short-term cons.&lt;ref name="Bacon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt; The process of growing the tree biomass is energy efficient compared with growing corn or sugar cane for ethanol. However, it also takes longer to grow trees than to grow corn, and so any accurate research on sustainability and crop rotation (even for fast growing trees) requires a long time commitment, which up to now has been hard to find.  It has been estimated that this process, including the building of processing plants and then refining of the growing and processing stage could take at least a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lave |first=LB |last2=Griffin |first2=W |title=Import Ethanol, Not Oil |journal=Issues In Science &amp; Technology |year=2006 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another drawback to the processing of cellulosic ethanol is that there is little known about the waste/by products from the processing. Of particular concern to some is the biological method of pre-treatment. It is estimated that there is the possibility of producing almost as much (if not more) waste than usable ethanol, with waste products including mold, bacteria, yeast, biological toxins and allergens produced by these microorganisms, enzymes, and other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Menetrez |first=MY |title=The Potential Environmental Impact of Waste from Cellulosic Ethanol Production |journal=Journal of the Air &amp; Waste Management Association |year=2010 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=171–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==

===Trillium===

Trillium was founded in February 1988 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The co-founders were [[Jeff Lawrence (entrepreneur)|Jeff Lawrence]] and Larisa Chistyakov. Giorgio Propersi joined in September 1989. The initial capitalization of Trillium when it was incorporated was $1,000. The name Trillium came about because of a mistake. Jeff and Larisa asked for company name suggestions from family and friends. Someone suggested a character named [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]] from the book ''[[Hitchhikers guide|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' by [[Douglas Adams]]. They thought the suggestion was supposed to be [[trillium]], a flower in the [[lily]] family. They liked the sound and symbolism of the name Trillium so they used it.

Trillium was started as a consulting company. Its first consulting jobs were to develop communications software for [[bisynchronous]], [[Asynchronous serial communication|asynchronous]] and multiprotocol [[Packet Assembler/Disassembler|PAD]] products. Consulting continued through the end of 1990. While consulting, the co-founders decided there was an opportunity to develop and [[software license|license]] [[portable software|portable]] [[source code]] [[software]] for [[communications protocols]]. Towards the end of 1990 Trillium became focused on developing its own products.

[[Source code]] is a symbolic language (e.g., the [[C programming language]]) which is run through a [[compiler]] to generate [[executable|binary]] code which can run on a particular [[microprocessor]]. Communications systems have a variety of [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[computer software|software]] architectures, use a variety of microprocessors and use a variety of [[software development environment]]s. It wasn’t technically possible to develop a single piece of binary code that could run on many different systems. Source code, if properly designed and supported, can provide a highly leveragable solution that can be integrated and used in many different systems. The proper way to test source code is to compile it for all possible environments it might run in and then run and test it in those environments. There were as many environments as there were pieces of communications equipment. That testing approach was difficult. To overcome this difficulty Trillium developed an [[operating system]] called the Multiprocessor Operating System (MOS) that could run under commercially available operating systems such as [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Linux]] and provide a simulation and testing environment for its software products.

Trillium's first software product supported the [[X.25]] communications protocol. Subsequent products were developed for a number of [[data communications]] and [[telephony|voice communications]] protocols. Trillium's primary focus in its early years was on [[control plane]] and [[Signalling (telecommunications)|signalling plane]] protocols. In later years Trillium also developed some [[forwarding plane|data plane]] protocols. A more comprehensive list of the software products developed by Trillium is listed in the [[Trillium digital systems#Product History|Product History]] section. Trillium is currently developing software products to support the [[Femtocell]] communications protocols. Throughout its history Trillium was also very active in standards setting bodies including the [[ITU-T|CCITT/ITU]], [[IETF]], [[ATM Forum]], Frame Relay Forum and others.

Trillium software products were used in communications and networking products designed for the [[Public data network|PDN]], [[PSTN]], [[Internet]], enterprise networks and [[home network]]s.
Trillium's evolution and development, paralleled the evolution and development of the communications industry. In 1988 there were less than 1/2 million Internet users, about 4 million cell phone users and no broadband (DSL, cable) users. The industry went through significant transitions from the mid-1980s through the early 2000s, as described in the [[Trillium digital systems#Market History|market history]] section. By 2008 there were over 1.4 billion [[Internet]] users,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Internet Users Statistics and 2014 World Population Stats|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost 3.3 billion [[mobile phone]] users&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type%3Dmedia%26storyID%3DnL29172095  |accessdate=2010-11-19 |df= }}{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 1 billion [[broadband]] users.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS201314+28&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, communications equipment manufacturers licensed source code software to reduce their time to market, decrease their development risk and reduce their costs. By 1999 many companies offered source code software products. Some of these included:

Trillium was funded entirely by its cash flow from its founding through 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1139182|title=Trillium to Offer Services via Design Centers - April 13, 1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1998, Trillium decided that to provide [[liquidity]] for its shareholders and accelerate its growth it should raise money through an [[initial public offering]]. After discussions with investment bankers, it was decided that to improve its initial public offering [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]], it would be necessary to first raise some [[private equity]] money to fund organizational expansion, revenue growth and revenue rebalancing. In early 1999, Trillium entered discussions with various [[venture capital]] and private equity firms. It closed two private equity deals, one with Rader Reinfrank &amp; Co. in July 1999 for $10 million and the other with Intel Capital and its Intel Communications Fund in September 1999 for $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;"Venture Capital Investment is Made in Trillium Digital". Wall Street Journal, September 17, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Rader Reinfrank &amp; Co. was the lead investor and Intel Capital was a co-investor. Trillium used the funds to accelerate the growth of its organization and product line in preparation for a planned initial public offering in either 2000 or 2001. Trillium received [[ISO 9001]] certification in February 2000 and [[Software Engineering Institute|SEI]] -[[Capability Maturity Model|CMM]] Level 2 certification in December 2001.

===Trillium, an Intel Company===

During 1999 and 2000, a number of Trillium's competitors either went public, or were acquired.

In March 2000, following inquiries from potential acquirers, Trillium decided to explore its sale. Trillium created a list of potential acquirers that included communications equipment manufacturers, communications semiconductor companies and a few other companies. [[Intel| Intel Corporation]] was part of this list since they were already an investor in Trillium. [[Craig Barrett (businessman)|Craig Barrett]], the CEO of Intel, felt it was important for Intel to be involved in the communications and networking business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/12/18/293148/index.htm|title=Craig Barrett Inside Can this nature-loving onetime professor lead Intel out of the woods? One thing's for sure: He's got awfully big hiking boots to fill. - December 18, 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1997, and over a 5-year period, Intel spent over $10 billion acquiring communications chip, hardware and software companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.reed-electronics.com/eb-mag/article/CA6355853?pubdate=8%2F1%2F2006 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831154511/http://www.reed-electronics.com/eb-mag/article/CA6355853?pubdate=8%2F1%2F2006 |archive-date=2006-08-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel acquired Trillium in a deal for $300 million that closed on August 24, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/intel/annual02/ar02.pdf |format=PDF |title=Intel Annual Report 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7D81E3DF931A3575BC0A9669C8B63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1142135|title=Intel's Trillium Buy Completes Consolidation - August 3, 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel’s objectives in acquiring Trillium were to expand the networking software available to its [[network processor]], establish a viable entry into the networking software business to complement the network processor business as they moved to sell platform level solutions, and validate and optimize software designs to address high growth communications market segments including [[voice over IP]] and [[wireless]].

As part of the closing, Intel certified there were no material adverse effects; any changes reasonably likely in the future to be materially adverse on the operations, assets, liabilities or earnings of Intel. On August 28, 2000 Intel stopped selling and recalled its [[Pentium III]] due to design defects and performance problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-245029.html|title=Glitch prompts Intel to recall 1.13-GHz Pentiums|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 21, 2000 it issued an earnings warning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartmoney.com/breaking-news/index.cfm?story=20000921043242|title=MarketWatch - Stock Market Quotes, Business News, Financial News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on September 28 it cancelled its Timna chip&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/18726/intel_kills_timna.html|title=Intel Kills Timna|date=29 September 2000|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; and delayed its [[Pentium 4]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-246376.html|title=PC makers report Pentium 4 delay|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Itanium chips due to design defects and performance problems. In just a little over a month (from August 24, 2000 to September 29, 2000) Intel stock plummeted from over $70 per share to $40 per share.

Trillium became a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel. It was renamed for external purposes as “Trillium, an Intel Company” and for internal purposes as the "Networking Software Division (NSD)". In 2002, NSD was renamed as the “[[Control Plane]] Processing Division (CPPD)”. The division was initially part of Intel's Network Communications Group, which later became the Intel Communications Group. One of the co-founders moved into Intel when the deal closed, and the other stayed with Trillium. The functional integration of Trillium into Intel was considered successful, but the strategic and value integration was considered less successful. After the deal closed Trillium continued to focus on offering its communications software products and professional services to external customers and also started to develop cross divisional and business group customers within Intel. Trillium focused significant resources on integrating its software products into Intel network processors and related products.

The co-founders of Trillium left Intel in March and September 2002. Larisa died on December 22, 2008.

===Continuous Computing, Trillium Software===

As the [[Internet bubble|dot-com bubble]] burst in 2000 and 2001, Intel started selling many of its communications businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=188701421|title=Updated: Intel puts comms-chip businesses up for sale, says report|work=EETimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continuous Computing]], based in [[San Diego]], [[California]], acquired Trillium's [[intellectual property]], customers and also hired some Trillium engineering, sales and marketing staff from Intel in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Intel-to-sell-communications-unit/2100-1001_3-980625.html|title=Intel to sell communications unit|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/1571801|title=Intel Sells Trillium to CCPU|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuous Computing continued to license Trillium software, develop additional software Trillium software products and also bundle the software with its products. Trillium software products celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=156856&amp;site=nxtcomm|title=Trillium Turns 20|work=Light Reading}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RadiSys, Trillium Software===

[[RadiSys]] which provides hardware and software for Internet-based telecommunications, announced on May 3, 2011 that it was going to acquire Continuous Computing and its Trillium software products in a deal valued at $120 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110503007452/en/RadiSys-Reports-Higher-Expected-Q1-2011-Revenue|title=RadiSys Reports Higher Than Expected Q1 2011 Revenue and Announces Definitive Agreement to Acquire Continuous Computing - Business Wire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; RadiSys and Continuous Computing are focused on complementary areas of networking technology.

==Market history==

There were a number of regulatory, financial and technology events that drove the telecommunications industry, and subsequently drove Trillium's growth and development.

* General network infrastructure moved from [[Time-division multiplexing|time division multiplexing]] to [[statistical multiplexing]] and from character based communications to [[packet switching|packet based]] communications.
*Work on the [[OSI reference model]] was initiated in 1977. The OSI reference model is an abstract description for layered communications and computer network protocol design.
* Telephone network infrastructure moved from [[In-band signalling]] to [[out-of-band signalling]].
* Computing and communications moved from closed and proprietary [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] based systems to [[Open system (computing)|open systems]].
* Equipment manufacturers moved from in-house technology development to buying or licensing hardware and [[software license|software technology]] from other technology providers.
* Different voice, data and video networking technologies [[Convergence (telecommunications)|converged]].
* Equipment manufacturers moved from using [[proprietary software]] solutions to [[open source| open source software]] solutions.
*[[Breakup of the Bell System|The breakup of AT&amp;T]] was initiated in 1974 by the U.S. Department of Justice [[antitrust]] suit against the telephone company's [[monopoly]]. In 1982, AT&amp;T agreed to break itself up into several firms in 1984. The breakup of the AT&amp;T's monopoly led to a surge of competition in the long distance telecommunications market as new carriers came into existence. It also improved the ability of other companies to sell their equipment to the [[RBOC|regional Bell operating companies]].
*The first [[TCP/IP]] based wide area network became operational in 1983. The Internet was opened to commercial interests in 1988 and was initially used for e-mail, file transfer and other applications.
*The first release of the Mosaic [[Web browser]] was in late 1994.
*The [[Stock market crash#The Crash of 1987|stock market crashed in 1987]]. A [[recession]] followed, starting in [[List of recessions in the United States|mid-1990 and ending in 1991]].
*[[Software bug]]s in the switching systems of the core network caused massive failures in the telephone networks of [[AT&amp;T]] in 1990&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D9163DF934A25752C0A966958260&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bell Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Bell]] in 1991. These network crashes shutdown telephone service for large portions of the United States and prompted Congressional investigations into the reliability of the telephone network.
*The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) started competitive wireless [[spectrum auction]]s in 1994.
*The [[Telecommunications act of 1996|Telecommunications Act of 1996]] was signed into law in early 1996. It [[deregulated]] portions of the telecommunications industry and led to a surge of competition in the local access, wireless and other markets. Other countries also started deregulating their telecommunications industries.
*The [[Asian financial crisis]] erupted in mid-1997 as poor fundamentals, structural weaknesses and a shift in investor sentiments caused liquidity problems in the financial systems of a number of Asian countries. The crisis stabilized by the beginning of 1999.
*The [[Dot-com bubble|dot com bubble]] started growing in the mid to late 1990s and burst in 2000. The bubble was driven by a large increase in Internet access, large increase in wireless handset availability, and a belief that data intensive applications were going to drive the next generation network. The network was moving from being voice centric to data centric, from narrowband technologies to broadband technologies and from 2nd generation wireless to 3rd generation wireless technologies to accommodate real and perceived demand. Data bandwidth needs were doubling every 3 – 4 months. As the bubble burst, network operators, service providers, equipment manufacturers and others suffered huge losses. Over $2 trillion in market capitalization evaporated in less than 12 months and over 500,000 jobs were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MnoiYEko0JwC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=jobs+lost+in+telecommunications+meltdown&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Y4s5_ss_Bf&amp;sig=bEAG2_TnoQvJSFMHQIkOgpx5YHs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=Shaping American Telecommunications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 60 telecommunications carriers in the U.S. filed for bankruptcy between 2000 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Telecom-headed-for-bankruptcy-reruns/2100-1037_3-5185087.html|title=Telecom headed for bankruptcy reruns?|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2000, it was difficult for companies to raise money through private equity funding or initial public offerings.

==Product technology==

All Trillium products are based on the Trillium Advanced Portability Architecture (TAPA), a set of architectural and coding standards designed to ensure that the individual source code software products are [[Portability (software)|portable]] and independent of the target system's [[compiler]], [[Microprocessor|processor]], [[operating system]] and architecture. Each software product is provided as [[C programming language|C]] source code and has four [[API|programming interfaces]]: the system services interface, the layer management interface, the upper interface and the lower interface. TAPA describes the parameters and expected behavior across each interface.

Individual Trillium software products consist of 10,000’s to 100,000’s lines of source code. Each Trillium software product could be used separately, or in conjunction with other software products to build complete protocol stacks. Trillium software products were also able to support different national and industry variants of specific protocols. In later years, as the different network infrastructure technologies converged, Trillium software products were able to support interworking and translation between the different network infrastructure technologies (e.g. telephony to Internet Protocols). They were used in a wide range of network equipment, products and devices.

==Product history==

During its history, Trillium has developed over 150 software products, which parallel the evolution and development of the network infrastructure. These software products support [[communications protocols]] specified in international (e.g. [[ITU]]), national (e.g. [[ANSI]]) and industry (e.g. [[IETF]]) standards. These products are licensed primarily to telecommunications equipment manufacturers and include:

==Trillium poster==

Trillium conceived of and published a poster that provided detailed technical information about the network infrastructure and protocols in an attractive format that was easy to understand. It became an indispensable tool for the communications industry, and was displayed on the office walls and conference rooms of tens of thousands of engineers, venture capitalists and financial analysts around the world. The poster is periodically updated to reflect changes in the network infrastructure and protocols. The 1st generation poster was published in 1997 and was inspired by the "ISO and CCITT Data Communication Standards" poster published by Retix. The 5th generation of the poster was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpu.com/poster/tour.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123035/http://www.ccpu.com/poster/tour.html |archivedate=2008-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UK Academy for Information Systems''' ('''UKAIS''') is an active combination of a traditional [[learned society]], [[communications channel]] and [[pressure group]]. It is a conduit for communication between industry and academia to ensure that relevant courses can be designed and research initiatives established throughout the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

By continually improving the quality and relevance of teaching through innovative and rigorous research the society contributes to both academic development and excellence in IS practice throughout the UK. Part of their role has been to establish links between commercial, government and academic organisations. Teaching, research and practice in the field are supported by UKAIS through its annual conference, PhD consortia, workshops, regional groups and quarterly newsletter.

==History==
The society arose from a meeting in 1993 of leading UK academics in information systems. Concerns were expressed at the meeting about the way [[information systems|IS]] teaching and research were funded which stemmed from a lack of recognition of IS as a growing and important academic discipline. The UKAIS was established in 1994 to remedy this situation as a charity, whose aims are to provide a better knowledge of IS within the UK and to provide a forum for discussing issues in IS teaching and research. It also aims to be influential in obtaining better understanding of the uniqueness of the subject by [[HEFCE]], the [[UK Research Councils]], professional bodies, UK business and Government. They have successfully achieved recognition that IS is not being dealt with sufficiently by such bodies and have suggested ways of improving the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About UKAIS|url=https://www.ukais.org/About|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The UKAIS has attempted to create a 'uniform' definition of Information Systems.

{{quote|text=Information systems are the means by which people and organisations, utilising technologies, gather, process, store, use and disseminate information.}}

Beyond this the work of the society is within the domain involving the study of theories and practices related to the social and technological phenomena, which determine the development, use and effects of information systems in organisations and society.

'''Walter Percy Day''' [[Order of the British Empire|O.B.E.]] (1878–1965) was a British painter best remembered for his work as a [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] artist and special effects technician in the film industry.
Professional names include '''W. Percy Day'''; '''Percy Day'''; “'''Pop'''” or “'''Poppa'''” Day, owing to his collaboration with sons Arthur George Day (1909–1952) draughtsman, Thomas Sydney Day (1912–1985), stills photographer and cameraman, and stepson, [[Peter Ellenshaw]], who also worked in this field.

==Early life==
Walter Percy Day was born in [[Luton]] ([[Bedfordshire]]) to Eli Day and Lucy Day, née Crawley, the second of three children. From 1908 to 1912, he resided in Tunisia, at Sidi Bou Saïd and Tunis, where he pursued a career as a painter of portraits and Orientalist scenes. The dramatic consequences of the “[[Jellaz Cemetery|affaire du Jellaz]]” uprising obliged the family to return to Britain early in 1912.

==The silent film era==
In 1919, at Ideal Films Studios in [[Borehamwood]], near [[Elstree]] Day mastered the art of illusionist techniques. Special effects such as those produced by Day enabled directors to enlarge their repertoire and to tackle subjects which might otherwise have been too costly to produce. In 1922, he relocated to France to its more vibrant cinema. There he introduced the use of the glass shot into French cinema. Used for the first time in [[Henry Roussel]]'s ''Les Opprimés'', released in 1923, the process was hailed by a critic as a revolution in cinematography.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Baye, ''A propos du film Les Opprimés. Une Révolution dans le décor cinématographique''. Ciné Miroir, 15 March 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the directors with whom Day collaborated during the twenties were [[Jean Renoir]], [[Raymond Bernard]], [[Julien Duvivier]], and [[Abel Gance]]. In addition to creating visual effects for ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'' (1927), Day also played the role of the British Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Hood]] in the film. From 1928, Day's studio became a team, when sons Arthur George Day (1909–1912) and Thomas Sydney Day (1912–1985) began to work for their father, the former as draughtsman and the latter as cameraman and stills photographer, starting with [[Léon Poirier]]'s ''[[Verdun: Visions of History]]'' (1928).

In the late 1920s, he learned a new technique while working at the Elstree studio on [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Ring (1927 film)|The Ring]]'', that used mirrors and angling to superimpose a miniature over a scene. The inventor, [[Eugen Schüfftan]], whose office was opposite the studios, taught him the process directly.

When shooting the façade of the department store in Julien Duvivier's film ''Au Bonheur des Dames'' (1929) proved to be an insurmountable difficulty, Day utilised the stationary matte, a process similar to that patented by Norman Dawn on 11 June 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Cotta Vaz, Mark |author1link=Mark Cotta Vaz|author2=Barron, Craig |author2link=Craig Barron|year=2002|title=The Invisible Art: The Legends of Movie Matte Painting|location=San Francisco California|publisher=Chronicle Books|pages=54–57 |isbn=978-0-8118-4515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the British film industry==
A meeting with [[Alexander Korda]] opened up new perspectives for the Day studio. Day worked with Korda on ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'' (1933) a film starring [[Charles Laughton]]. Day accordingly established a studio in Iver ([[Buckinghamshire]]) and from 1936, directed the matte department at [[Denham Studios]]. The artist painted mattes and created trick shots for numerous films by Korda and his stable of directors, who included his brother [[Zoltan Korda]], [[Anthony Asquith]], [[William Cameron Menzies]] (''[[Things to Come]]'', 1936), [[Michael Powell]], [[Lothar Mendes]] and [[David Lean]]. In 1946 Day joined the Korda group as Director of Special Effects at Korda's new premises at [[Shepperton Studios]] where he remained until his retirement in 1954.

Poppa Day's team disbanded once World War II began as all three sons enlisted. Pop Day trained some promising young matte painters, including Wally Veevers, who took over the matte department at [[Shepperton Studios]] when Pop Day retired in 1952.

During the war, the film studios made a series of heroic war films, aimed at boosting the morale of the beleaguered British, including Powell and Pressburger's ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (US: ''The Invaders'', 1941), [[Noël Coward]] and [[David Lean]]'s ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' (1942) and [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]]'s ''[[The First of the Few]]'' (US: ''Spitfire'', also 1942]. In addition to designing special effects for these films, Day created trick photography for many other British classics released during the forties, including ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' [US: Stairway to Heaven, 1946], ''[[Anna Karenina (1948 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1948), and ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949). In [[Laurence Olivier]]'s production of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' (1944), many of the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] battle scenes were painted on glass by Day, who contrived to make the horses' heads move, the pennants flutter and whirring motion of a flight of arrows in the completed shots. The Powell and Pressburger production of ''[[I Know Where I'm Going!]]'' (1945) contains a sequence in which the hero and heroine's boat gets sucked into the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan|Corryvreckan whirlpool]]. ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947) was shot entirely on the [[Pinewood Studios]] back lot with matte of the Himalayan mountain range painted by Day and his assistants.

In 1948, Day was awarded the [[O.B.E.]] for his services to British cinema. Cameraman [[Christopher Challis]], has rendered homage to Percy Day's achievements: "Being able to marry painted backgrounds on glass to real action foregrounds opened up a new world to film makers… To appreciate the magnitude of his achievement, one has to understand the complexity of the work. Hours of painstaking labour with many retakes to obtain perfection. Now it is all too easy with computers and electronics and few people remain who can understand just how complicated it was. [Day’s] name should certainly be numbered among the great film pioneers, alongside [[Léon Gaumont|Gaumont]], [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière]], etc".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from a letter to Susan Day dated 14 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Powell, for his part, hailed Percy Day as "the greatest trick-man and film wizard that I have ever known…"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Powell, ''A Life in Movies: an autobiography''. London: Mandarin (pbk), 1986, p. 311, 239&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Day’s legacy was ranked by the British daily ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2008 as on a par with the great French special effects pioneer [[Georges Méliès]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey MacNab, "He Made Monsters", ''The Independent'', 20 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Day died in [[Los Angeles]].
