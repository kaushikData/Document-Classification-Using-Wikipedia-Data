      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18536">'''Arnold Paole''' (''Arnont Paule'' in the original documents; an early [[German language|German]] rendition of a [[Serbian language|Serbian]] name or nickname, perhaps Арнаут Павле, ''[[Arnaut]] Pavle''; died c. 1726) was a [[Serbia]]n [[hajduk]] who was believed to have become a [[vampire]] after his death, initiating an epidemic of supposed vampirism that killed at least 16 people in his native village of Meduegna (also rendered as Metwett; likely a German rendition of Serbian "[[Medveđa (Trstenik)|Medveđa]])", located at the [[West Morava|West Morava river]] in [[Trstenik, Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Vampir i druga bica u nasem narodnom verovanju i predanju | publisher=SAN | author=Djordjevic, Tihomir | year=1953 | location=Belgrade | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dragoljub Pavlovic, Austrijska vladavina u severnoj Srbiji (1718-1739), Drzavna stamparija Kraljevine Srbije, Beograd 1901, pages 162-164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Austrijska vladavina u severnoj Srbiji (1718-1739) | publisher=Drzavna stamparija Kraljevine Srbije | author=Pavlovic, Dragoljub | year=1901 | location=Beograd | pages=162–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Pod nebom Krusevca | publisher=Prosveta | author=Adam, Stosic | year=1996 | location=Beograd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paole's case, similar to that of [[Petar Blagojevich]], became famous because of the direct involvement of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] authorities and the documentation by Austrian physicians and officers, who confirmed the reality of vampires. Their report of the case was distributed in [[Western Europe]] and contributed to the spread of vampire belief among educated Europeans. The report and its significance for the subsequent [[Vampire folklore by region#Medieval and early modern Europe|eighteenth century vampire controversy]] are nowadays explained with the poor understanding of the process of [[corpse]] [[decomposition]] at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Knowledge of the case is based mostly on the reports of two Austrian military doctors, Glaser and Flückinger, who were successively sent to investigate the case.&lt;ref name=gb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paranormal.de/vampir/quelleb.html|title=Glaser's report in the original German|accessdate=2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VeRengl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vampgirl.com/visum.html |title=A translation of Flückinger's report |accessdate=2006-07-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315125133/http://www.vampgirl.com/visum.html |archivedate=2006-03-15 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VeRgerm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paranormal.de/vampir/quellec.html|title= Flückinger's report in the original  German|accessdate=2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have suggested that Paole's case has influenced the depiction of vampires in popular culture texts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283318599_Vampire_Evolution|title = Vampire Evolution|last = Jøn|first = A.

==Background==
With the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (''[[Požarevac]]'', 1718), the [[Habsburg]] [[Monarchy]] annexed most of [[Serbia]] and the northern part of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], territories which had been part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. These remained in Austrian control until the [[Treaty of Belgrade]] (1739), when the Austrians were forced to cede them back to the Turks. During this 20-year period, these newly conquered boundary districts were subject to direct military rule from [[Vienna]] for strategic, [[finance|fiscal]] and other reasons. As a result of the devastation brought about by previous Austrian-Ottoman wars, these areas were in poor condition, with a scarce and partly [[nomadism|nomadic]] population, little [[agriculture]] and an emphasis on cattle-breeding. The Austrian authorities sought to further economic development and to attract German-speaking Serbian settlers to the new territories. Many of the Serbs, especially those who had immigrated from Ottoman-held areas, were recruited as [[militia]]men ([[hajduk]]s) for the peacetime protection of the borders and for regular military service at war, in exchange for unalienable lots of land. It was in these communities that the earliest well-documented alleged vampire attacks were attested.

==The first outbreak==
This outbreak is only known from Flückinger's report about the second epidemic and its prehistory. According to the account of the Medveđa locals as retold there, Arnold Paole was a hajduk who had moved to the village from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]]-controlled part of Serbia. He reportedly often mentioned that he had been plagued by a vampire at a location named Gossowa (perhaps [[Kosovo]]), but that he had cured himself by eating soil from the vampire's grave and smearing himself with his blood. About 1725, he broke his neck in a fall from a haywagon. Within 20 or 30 days after Paole's death, four people complained that they had been plagued by him. These people all died shortly thereafter. It was then remembered that Arnold had often related in the environs of Cassanovia, and on the Turkish Servia, he had often been tormented by a Turkish vampire. He also relayed that he attempted to cure himself by eating earth of the grave of the vampire, and smearing himself with his blood.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 333-334.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten days later, and forty days after Arnold's death, the villagers, advised by their ''hadnack'' (a military/administrative title) who had witnessed such events before, opened his grave. They saw that the corpse was undecomposed with all the indications of an arch-vampire. His veins were replete with fluid-blood "and that fresh blood had flowed from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears; that the shirt, the covering, and the coffin were completely bloody; that the old nails on his hands and feet, along with the skin, had fallen off, and that new ones had grown". Further, "his body was red, his hair, nails and beard had all grown again. Concluding that Paole was indeed a vampire, they drove a stake through his heart, to which he reacted by frightful shriek as if he were alive, groaning and bleeding, and burned the body. That done, they cut off his head and burnt the whole body. They then disinterred Paole's four supposed victims and performed the same procedure, to prevent them from becoming vampires as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The second outbreak==
About five years later, in the winter of 1731, a new epidemic occurred, with more than ten people dying within several weeks, some of them in just two or three days without any previous illness and others after 3 days of languishing. The numbers and the age of the deceased vary somewhat between the two main sources.

Glaser's report on the case states that by 12 December, 13 people had died in the course of six weeks. Glaser names the following victims (here rearranged chronologically): Miliza (Serbian ''Milica'', a 50-year-old woman); Milloi (Serbian ''Miloje'', a 14-year-old boy); Joachim (a 15-year-old boy); Peter (Serbian ''Petar'', a 15-day-old boy); Stanno (Serbian ''Stana'', a 20-year-old woman) as well as her newborn child, which Glaser notes was buried "behind a fence, where the mother had lived" due to not having lived long enough to be baptized; Wutschiza (Serbian ''Vučica'', a nine-year-old boy), Milosova (Serbian ''Milosava'', a 30-year-old wife of a [[hajduk]]), Radi (Serbian ''Rade'', a 24-year-old man), and Ruschiza (Serbian ''Ružica'', a 40-year-old woman). The sick had complained of stabs in the sides and pain in the chest, prolonged fever and jerks of the limbs. Glaser reports that the locals considered Milica and Stana to have started the vampirism epidemic. According to his retelling, Milica had come to the village from Ottoman-controlled territories six years before. The locals' testimony indicated that she had always been a good neighbour and that, to the best of their knowledge, she had never "believed or practiced something diabolic". However, she had once mentioned to them that, while still in Ottoman lands, she had eaten two sheep that had been killed by vampires. Stana, on the other hand, had admitted that when she was in Ottoman-controlled lands, she had smeared herself with vampire blood as a protection against vampires (as these had been very active there). According to local belief, both things would cause the women to become vampires after death.

According to Flückinger's report, by the 7th of January, 17 people had died within a period of three months (the last two of these apparently after Glaser's visit). He mentions Miliza (''Milica'', a 69-year-old woman, died after a three-month illness); an unnamed 8 year-old child; Milloe (''Miloje'', a 16-year-old boy, died after a three-day illness); Stana (a 20-year-old woman, died in childbirth after a three-day illness, reportedly said that she had smeared herself with vampire blood) as well as her stillborn child (as Flückinger observes, "half-eaten by the dogs due to a slovenly burial"); an unnamed 10-year-old girl; Joachim (a 17-year-old, died after a three-day illness); the ''hadnack''&amp;apos;s unnamed wife; Ruscha (''Ruža'' &amp;ndash; variant of ''Ružica'' &amp;ndash; a woman, died after a ten-day illness); Staniko (''Stanjko'', a 60-year-old man); Miloe (''Miloje'', the second victim of that name; a 25-year-old man); Ruža's child (18 days old); Rhade (''Rade'', a 21-year-old servant of the local hajduk [[corporal]], died after a three-month-long illness); the local standard-bearer's (''barjaktar''&amp;apos;s) unnamed wife, apparently identical to Milosava in the other report along with her child; the eight-week-old child of the ''hadnack''; Stanoicka (''Stanojka'', a 20-year-old woman, the wife of a hajduk, died after a three-day illness). According to her father-in-law Joviza (''Jovica''), Stanojka had gone to bed healthy 15 days previous, but had woken up at midnight in terrible fear and cried that she had been throttled by the late Miloje. Flückinger states that the locals explain the new epidemic with the fact that Milica, the first to die, had eaten the meat of sheep that the "previous vampires" (i.e. Paole and his victims from five years prior) had killed. He also mentions, in passing, the claims that Stana, before her death, had admitted having smeared herself with blood to protect herself from vampires and would therefore become a vampire herself, as would her child.

According to [[Augustin Calmet]]'s analysis of the case, "a girl named Stanoska, daughter of the Heyducq Jotiutzo, who went to bed in perfect health, awoke in the middle of the night in a tremble, uttering terrible shrieks, and saying that the son of Heyducq Millo who had been dead nine weeks, had nearly strangled her in her sleep. She fell into a languid state from that moment, and at the end of three days she died. What this girl had said of Millo's son made him known at once to be a vampire: he was exhumed and found to be such. The principle people of the place, with the doctors and surgeons, examined how vampirism could have sprung up again after the precautions they had taken years before."&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The investigation==
The villagers complained of the new deaths to [[oberstleutnant]] Schnezzer, the Austrian military commander in charge of the administration. The latter, fearing an [[epidemic]] of [[infectious disease|pestilence]], sent for Imperial Contagions-Medicus (roughly, [[Infectious Disease]] Specialist) Glaser stationed in the nearby town of [[Paraćin]]. On 12 December 1731, Glaser examined the villagers and their houses. He failed to find any signs of a contagious malady and blamed the deaths on the [[malnutrition]] common in the region as well as the unhealthy effects of the severe [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[fasting]]. However, the villagers insisted that the illnesses were caused by vampires. At the moment, two or three households were gathering together at night, with some asleep and others on the watch. They were convinced that the deaths wouldn't stop unless the vampires were executed by the authorities, and threatened to abandon the village in order to save their lives if that wasn't done. Failing Glaser consented to the exhumation of some of the deceased. To his surprise, he found that most of them were not decomposed and many were swollen and had blood in their mouths, while several others who had died ''more'' recently (namely Vučica, Milosava, and Rade) were rather decomposed. Glaser outlined his findings in a report to the [[Jagodina]] commandant's office, recommending that the authorities should pacify the population by fulfilling its request to "execute" the vampires. Schnezzer furthered Glaser's report to the Supreme Command in [[Belgrade]] (the city was then held by Austrian forces). The vice-commandant, Botta d'Adorno, sent a second commission to investigate the case.

The new commission included a military surgeon, Johann Flückinger, two officers, lieutenant colonel Büttner and J. H. von Lindenfels, along with two other military surgeons, Siegele and Johann Friedrich Baumgarten. On the 7th of January, together with the village [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s and some local [[Romani people|Gypsies]], they opened the graves of the deceased. Their findings were similar to Glaser's, although their report contains much more anatomical detail. The commission established that, while five of the corpses (the ''hadnack'' 's wife and child, Rade, and the standard-bearer's wife and child) were decomposed, the remaining twelve were "quite complete and undecayed" and exhibited the traits that were commonly associated with vampirism. Their chests and in some cases other organs were filled with fresh (rather than [[coagulate]]d) blood; the viscera were estimated to be "in good condition"; various corpses looked plump and their skin had a "red and vivid" (rather than pale) colour; and in several cases, "the skin on ... hands and feet, along with the old nails, fell away on their own, but on the other hand completely new nails were evident, along with a fresh and vivid skin". In the case of Milica, the hajduks who witnessed the dissection were very surprised at her plumpness, stating that they had known her well, from her youth, and that she had always been very "lean and dried-up"; it was only in the grave she had attained this plumpness. The surgeons summarized all these phenomena by stating that the bodies were in "vampiric condition" (''Vampyrenstand'').
After the examination had been completed, the Gypsies cut off the heads of the supposed vampires and burned both their heads and their bodies, the ashes being thrown in the [[Great Morava|Morava river]]. The decomposed bodies were laid back into their graves. The report is dated 26 January 1732, Belgrade, and bears the signatures of the five officers involved.

On the 13th of February, Glaser's father, [[Vienna|Viennese]] doctor Johann Friedrich Glaser, who was also a correspondent of the [[Nuremberg]] journal ''Commercium Litterarium'', sent its editors a letter describing the entire case as his son had written to him about it already on the 18th of January. The story aroused great interest. After that, both reports (especially Flückinger's more detailed version) and the letter were reprinted in a number of articles and treatises.

Calmet notes: "They discovered at last, after much search, that the defunct Arnold Paul had killed not only the four persons of whom we have spoken, but also several oxen, of which the new vampires had eaten, and amongst others the son of Millo. Upon these indications they resolved to disinter all those who had died within a certain time, etc. Amongst forty, seventeen were found with all the most evident signs of vampirism; so they transfixed their hearts and cut off their heads also, then cast their ashes into the river. All the information and executions we have just mentioned were made judicial, in proper form, and attested by several officers who were garrisoned in the country, by the chief surgeons of the regiments, and by the principal inhabitants of the place. The verbal process of it was sent towards the end of last January to the Imperial Counsel of War at Vienna, which had established a military commission to examine into the truth of all these circumstances. Such was the declaration of the Hadnagi Barriarar and the ancient Heyducqs; and it was signed by Battuer, first lieutenant of the regiment of [[Charles Alexander, Duke of Württemberg|Alexander of Wurtemburg]], Clickstenger, surgeon-in-chief of the regiment of Frustemburch, three other surgeons of the company and Guoichitz, captain at Stallach."&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 334-335.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Astronomical Almanac'''''&lt;ref name=AsA&gt;The ''Astronomical Almanac'' for the Year 2015, (United States Naval Observatory/Nautical Almanac Office, 2014) {{ISBN|9780707741499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[almanac]] published by the [[United States Naval Observatory]] (USNO) and [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]] (HMNAO); it also includes data supplied by many scientists from around the world. It is considered a worldwide resource for fundamental astronomical data, often being the first publication to incorporate new [[International Astronomical Union]] resolutions. The almanac largely contains [[solar system]] [[ephemeris]] and [[astronomical catalog|catalogs]] of selected stellar and extragalactic objects.  The material appears in sections, each section addressing a specific astronomical category. The book also includes references to the material, explanations, and examples. It is available one year in advance of its date.

[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/ The ''Astronomical Almanac'' Online] is a companion to the printed volume.  It is designed to broaden the scope of the publication, not duplicate the data.  In addition to ancillary information, the ''Astronomical Almanac'' Online extends the printed version by providing data best presented in machine-readable form.

The '''''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac''''', currently in its third edition (2013), provides detailed discussion of usage and data reduction methods used by the ''Almanac''.&lt;ref name=ESAA2013&gt;S.E. Urban and P. Kenneth Seidelmann (eds), ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac: Third Edition'' (Mill Valley [CA]: University Science Books, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-891389-85-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It covers its history, significance, sources, methods of computation, and use of the data. Because the ''Astronomical Almanac'' prints primarily positional data, this book goes into great detail on techniques to get astronomical positions. Earlier editions of the supplement were published in 1961&lt;ref name=ESAE1961&gt;[https://archive.org/details/astronomicalalmanac1961 ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac''] (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1992.&lt;ref name=ESAA1992&gt;P. Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), [https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac ''Explanatory Supplement to the ''Astronomical Almanac'': A Revision to the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac''] (Sausalito [CA]: University Science Books, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication contents ==

'''Section A: PHENOMENA''' includes information on the seasons, phases of the Moon, configurations of the planets, eclipses, transits of Mercury or Venus, sunrise/set, moonrise/set times, and times for twilight. Preprints of many of these data appear in Astronomical Phenomena,&lt;ref name="APh"&gt;Astronomical Phenomena for the Year 2016 (United States Naval Observatory/Nautical Almanac Office and Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; another joint publication by USNO and HMNAO.

'''Section B: TIME-SCALES AND COORDINATE SYSTEMS''' contains calendar information, relationships between time scales, universal and sidereal times, Earth rotation angle, definitions of the various celestial coordinate systems, frame bias, precession, nutation, obliquity, intermediate system, the position and velocity of the Earth, and coordinates of Polaris. Preprints of many of these data also appear in Astronomical Phenomena.&lt;ref name="APh" /&gt;

'''Section C: SUN''' covers detailed positional information on the Sun, including the ecliptic and equatorial coordinates, physical ephemerides, geocentric rectangular coordinates, times of transit, and the equation of time.

'''Section D: MOON''' contains detailed positional information on the Moon including phases, mean elements of the orbit and rotation, lengths of mean months, ecliptic and equatorial coordinates, librations, and physical ephemerides.

'''Section L: NOTES AND REFERENCES''' gives notes on the data and references for source material found in the almanac.

'''Section M: GLOSSARY''' contains terms and definitions for many of the words and phrases, with emphasis on positional astronomy.

==Publication history==
The ''Astronomical Almanac'' is the direct descendant of the British and American [[Nautical almanac|navigational almanacs]]. The British ''Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris'' had been published since 1766, and was renamed ''The Astronomical Ephemeris'' in 1960. ''The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' had been published since 1852. In 1981 the British and American publications were combined under the title ''The Astronomical Almanac''."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/asa_history.php History of the Astronomical Almanac]." United States Naval Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Karem''' is an American [[journalist]] and [[White House press corps|White House correspondent]] for ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/06/28/i-dont-like-bullies-reporter-explains-why-he-confronted-sarah-huckabee-sanders/|title=‘I don’t like bullies’: Reporter explains why he confronted Sarah Huckabee Sanders|last=Phillips|first=Kristine|date=2017-06-28|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-06-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=|first2=|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Karem is the Executive Editor of [[The Montgomery County Sentinel]]. 

He was the 1991 recipient of the [[National Press Club]] Freedom of the Press award for refusing to reveal his sources in a story related to the killing of a police officer in [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/brian-j-karem-who-defended-media-at-white-house-press-briefing-once-went-to-jail-to-protect-a-source/|title=Before Sarah Huckabee Fight, Brian J. Karem Went to Jail for Sources|date=2017-06-27|work=TheWrap|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.press.org/news-multimedia/news/us-journalists-jailed-reporting-gather-national-press-club-6-pm-june-1|title=U.S. journalists jailed for reporting to gather at National Press Club, 6 pm June 1|date=2015-05-14|website=National Press Club|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He gained notoriety on June 27, 2017, when he confronted deputy [[White House Press Secretary|White House press secretary]] [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] on "inflammatory" comments about the performance of the press while covering President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tension-white-house-media/|title=Tension continues to flare between White House and media|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This wasn't the first time Karem went head to head with an Administration.  In 1992 he was covering an international drug summit in San Antonio, Texas.  He asked President Bush to comment on claims the summit was a "joke." President Bush countered that the press should ask questions of the other presidents and not him. Karem persisted until Bush allowed Karem to ask his question to Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=2153|title=American Journalism Review|website=ajrarchive.org|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karem lost his job at KMOL over his aggressive style of questioning.  This act gained him an interview with Sam Donaldson on ABC and a mention from Late Night Host, Jay Leno.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/article/Reporter-who-confronted-White-House-once-made-11253397.php|title=Reporter who confronted White House once made waves in San Antonio|work=San Antonio Express-News|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14, 2018, Karem once again called out Sarah Huckabee Sanders at a White House Press briefing on the Administration's policy of seizing children from their parents at US border crossings:  "Come on, Sarah, you’re a parent! Don’t you have any empathy for what these people are going through?” “They have less than you do. Sarah, come on, seriously."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/06/14/youre-a-parent-reporter-presses-sarah-huckabee-sanders-on-immigration/?noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse''' is a website that posts information and documents relating to civil rights litigation.  The Clearinghouse was founded by law professor [[Margo Schlanger]] in 2005, at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and moved in 2009 to the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"&gt;http://www.clearinghouse.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Record"&gt;Cynthia Georges, Civil rights legal papers compiled on law site, Washington University Record (Nov. 2, 2006), http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/8087.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clearinghouse makes its information and documents available at no cost to policy-makers, researchers, advocates, teachers, students, and the general public.&lt;ref name="Post-Dispatch"&gt;Preserving History (Editorial), St. Louis Post Dispatch (Dec. 5, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UMKC"&gt;Margo Schlanger &amp; Denise Lieberman, "Using Court Records for Research, Teaching, and Policymaking: The Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse", 75 U.M.K.C. L. Rev. 153 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; It is the leading internet source for the thousands of cases it covers, allowing the public unprecedented access to case documents, including court complaints and settlements.  It posts both historical documents, like the original court complaint and the trial transcript in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (at http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/SD-KS-0001-0008.pdf and http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/SD-KS-0001-0002.pdf), and more modern ones, like the settlement agreement in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank, a fair lending case President [[Barack Obama]] litigated in the 1990s (at http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FH-IL-0011-0008.pdf). It has received funding from the [[National Science Foundation]]&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt; and acknowledgement in newspaper editorial pages.&lt;ref name="Post-Dispatch"/&gt; 

The Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse is one of three law-school-based case Clearinghouses.  The others, both at [[Stanford Law School]], deal with [[intellectual property]] (the Stanford Intellectual Property Clearinghouse, at http://www.lexmachina.org/), and securities class action litigation (the Stanford Securities Class Action Clearinghouse, at http://securities.stanford.edu/, co-sponsored by [[Cornerstone Research]]).  

==Mission==
The goal of the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse is to solve the informational scarcity that undermines understanding of large-scale civil rights cases. &lt;ref name="Post-Dispatch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UMKC"/&gt;

It describes the problem on its website:
: ''Civil rights litigation has been of tremendous import in this country, especially since the 1950s. The injunctions entered in civil rights cases have transformed a huge number of governmental institutions--schools, prisons, mental health facilities, housing authorities, police departments, child welfare agencies, etc. Injunctive cases have closed some institutions and opened others, dominated budget politics, become models for statutory interventions, and generally regulated practices. Thousands of such cases have been filed over the past fifty years and new cases are filed all the time; hundreds, old and new, are ongoing and remain influential. But information about the cases has always been exceedingly hard to come by.''&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt; 

==Scope of Collection==
According to its website:
: ''The Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse is a collection of documents and information about civil rights cases in selected case categories across the United States. Currently, the categories include: Child Welfare, Criminal Justice, Disability Rights-Public Accommodations, Education, Election/Voting Rights, Equal Employment, Fair Housing/Lending/Insurance, Immigration, Indigent Defense, Intellectual Disability (Facility), Jail Conditions, Juvenile Institution, Mental Health (Facility), Nursing Home Conditions, Policing, Prison Conditions, Public Accommodations, Public Benefits &amp; Services, Public Housing, School Desegregation, Speech and Religious Freedom.''&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;

==Functionality==
Users can search for cases by case-type, facility, court, location, court, issue, lawyer, or judge, or any combination.  Case documents are posted in [[pdf]].  In addition, civil rights biographies and case-studies are cross-indexed.&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;

Prior to this, ICANN performed management responsibility under oversight of the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA), an agency of the United States [[Department of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/03/05/icann-vs-the-world/ |title=ICANN vs. the World |date=2011-03-05 |accessdate=2011-12-17 |author=Jerry Brito |publisher=TIME |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230085401/http://icannatlarge.com/ |archivedate=December 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of limits in the DNS definition and in certain protocols, namely the practical size of unfragmented [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) packets, resulted in a practical maximum of 13 [[root name server]] addresses that can be accommodated in DNS name query responses. However the root zone is serviced by several hundred servers at over 130 locations in many countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/news/blog/there-are-not-13-root-servers|title=There are not 13 root servers|website=www.icann.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stupid.domain.name/node/407|title=DNS root servers in the world « stupid.domain.name|website=stupid.domain.name|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Initialization of DNS service==
The DNS root zone is served by thirteen root server clusters which are authoritative for queries to the [[top-level domain]]s of the Internet.&lt;ref name=Ars /&gt;&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web|title=Root Servers|url=http://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers|accessdate=March 16, 2014|publisher=IANA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, every name resolution either starts with a query to a root server or uses information that was once obtained from a root server.

The root servers clusters have the official names ''a.root-servers.net'' to ''m.root-servers.net''.&lt;ref name=RS /&gt; To resolve these names into addresses, a DNS resolver must first find an authoritative server for the ''net'' zone. To avoid this [[circular dependency]], the address of at least one root server must be known for [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrapping]] access to the DNS.  For this purpose operating systems or DNS server or resolver software packages typically include a file with all addresses of the DNS root servers. Even if the IP addresses of some root servers change, at least one is needed to retrieve the current list of all name servers. This address file is called ''named.cache'' in the [[BIND]] name server reference implementation. The current official version is distributed by [[ICANN]]'s [[InterNIC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.internic.net/zones/named.cache|title=named.cache|publisher=InterNIC|date=2015-11-17|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the address of a single functioning root server, all other DNS information may be discovered recursively, and information about any domain name may be found.

==Redundancy and diversity==
The root DNS servers are essential to the function of the Internet, as most Internet services, such as the [[World Wide Web]] and electronic-mail, are based on domain names. The DNS servers are potential points of failure for the entire Internet. For this reason, multiple root servers are distributed worldwide.&lt;ref name=SANS&gt;{{cite web|title=SANS Institute InfoSec Reading Room|publisher=SANS|url=http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/dns/secure-root-dns-servers-991|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNS packet size of 512 octets limits a DNS response to thirteen addresses, until protocol extensions ([[EDNS]]) lifted this restriction.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=Why There Are Only 13 DNS Root Name Servers|author=Bradley Mitchell|date=November 19, 2008|publisher=About.com|url=http://compnetworking.about.com/b/2008/11/19/why-there-are-only-13-dns-root-name-servers.htm|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible to fit more entries into a packet of this size when using label compression, thirteen was chosen as a reliable limit. Since the introduction of [[IPv6]], the successor [[Internet Protocol]] to [[IPv4]], previous practices are being modified and extra space is filled with IPv6 name servers.

The [[root name server]]s are hosted in multiple secure sites with high-bandwidth access to accommodate the traffic load. At first, all of these installations were located in the United States; however, the distribution has shifted and this is no longer the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNS Root Servers: The most critical infrastructure on the internet|date=November 15, 2013|publisher=Slash Root|url=http://www.slashroot.in/dns-root-servers-most-critical-infrastructure-internet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually each DNS server installation at a given site is a cluster of computers with load-balancing routers.&lt;ref name=about /&gt; A comprehensive list of servers, their locations and properties is available at http://root-servers.org. As of January 2016, there were 517 root servers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Root Servers Technical Operations Assn|url=http://root-servers.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern trend is to use [[anycast]] addressing and routing to provide resilience and load balancing across a wide geographic area. For example, the ''j.root-servers.net'' server, maintained by [[Verisign]], is represented by 104 ({{as of|2016|1|lc=on}}) individual server systems located around the world, which can be queried using anycast addressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Root Server Technical Operations Assn|url=http://www.root-servers.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The content of the Internet root zone file is coordinated by a subsidiary of ICANN which performs the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) functions. [[Verisign]] generates and distributes the zone file to the various root server operators.

In 1997, when the Internet was transferred from U.S. government control to private hands, NTIA has exercised stewardship over the root zone. A 1998 Commerce Department document stated the agency was "committed to a transition that will allow the private sector to take leadership for DNS management" by the year 2000, however, no steps to make the transition happen were taken. In March 2014, NTIA announced it will transition its stewardship to a "global stakeholder community".&lt;ref name=Ars /&gt; 

According to Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, Lawrence E. Strickling, March 2014 was the right time to start a transition of the role to the global Internet community. The move came after pressure in the fallout of [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|revelations]] that the United States and its allies had engaged in surveillance. The chairman of the board of ICANN denied the two were connected, however, and said the transition process had been ongoing for a long time. ICANN president Fadi Chehadé called the move historic and said that ICANN will move toward multi-stakesholder control. Various prominent figures in Internet history, not affiliated with ICANN, also applauded the move.&lt;ref name=Ars /&gt;

NTIA's announcement did not immediately affect how ICANN performs its role.&lt;ref name=Ars&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/03/in-sudden-announcement-us-to-give-up-control-of-dns-root-zone/|title=In sudden announcement, US to give up control of DNS root zone|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|publisher=Ars Technica|date=14 March 2014|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2015/update-iana-transition|title=An Update on the IANA Transition|publisher=National Telecommunications and Information Administration|date=2015-08-17|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2016 NTIA announced that it had received a proposed plan to transition its stewardship role over the root zone, and would review it in the next 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strickling|first1=Lawrence|title=Reviewing the IANA Transition Proposal|url=https://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2016/reviewing-iana-transition-proposal|website=National Telecommunications and Information Administration|publisher=United States Department of Congress|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The proposal was adopted, and ICANN's renewed contract to perform the IANA function lapsed on September 30, 2016, resulting in the transition of oversight responsibility to the global stakeholder community represented within ICANN's governance structures. As a component of the transition plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-10mar16-en.pdf|title=Proposal to Transition the Stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Functions from the U.S. Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the Global Multistakeholder Community|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it created a new subsidiary called Public Technical Identifiers (PTI) to perform the IANA functions which include managing the DNS root zone.

==Signing of the root zone==
Since July 2010, the root zone has been signed with a [[DNSSEC]] signature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.root-dnssec.org/|title=Root DNSSEC: Information about DNSSEC for the Root Zone|publisher=Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers|accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing a single [[trust anchor]] for the Domain Name System that can in turn be used to provide a trust anchor for other [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI). The root zone is re-signed periodically with the root zone [[key signing key]] performed in a verifiable manner in front of witnesses in a [[Key ceremony|key signing ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2010-06-07-en |title=First KSK Ceremony |publisher=Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers |date=2010-04-18 |accessdate=2014-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414231507/https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2010-06-07-en |archivedate=2015-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iana.org/dnssec/ceremonies|title=Root KSK Ceremonies|publisher=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|date=2015-11-12|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Die Littauischen Wegeberichte''''' (German for ''Lithuanian route report'') is a compilation of 100 routes into the western [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] prepared by the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1384–1402.&lt;ref name=llt/&gt; The Knights waged the [[Lithuanian Crusade]] to convert [[Lithuanian mythology|pagan Lithuanians]] into Christianity since the 1280s. The crusade was characterized with frequent raids into the enemy territory to loot and pillage. Since Lithuania lacked a developed road network, local Lithuanian and Prussian scouts would describe and document the best and most effective routes for the military raids into Lithuania.

The reports contained brief directions using both natural (rivers, lakes, swamps, forests) and man-made (villages, nobility estates, roads, formerly inhabited places) landmarks for navigation.&lt;ref name=guda&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Edvardas |last=Gudavičius |encyclopedia=[[Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija]] |volume=XIII |location=Vilnius |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas |year=2008 |isbn=978-5-420-01641-1 |page=476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also described obstacles and provided locations of good places for rest camps, where to obtain drinking water or fodder for horses.&lt;ref name=mle/&gt; The place names were recorded in [[old German]], therefore some of them are quite distorted from their original Lithuanian form.&lt;ref name=jurg/&gt; Also, some places or place names did not survive to the present day. Therefore, there are many issues in trying to identify and locate the named places. However, the reports are still an important source for the study of Lithuanian local history, [[toponymy]], geographic, social, and economic aspects of the 14th-century Lithuanian society.&lt;ref name=guda/&gt; For example, ''Wegeberichte'' mentioned several ''alka'', i.e. sacred grooves or pagan shrines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-Central Europe, 1295-1345 | first=S.

The scout reports were archived in the [[Prussian State Archive Königsberg]].&lt;ref name=mle&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title=Wegeberichte |encyclopedia=Mažosios Lietuvos enciklopedija | publisher=[[Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas]] |location=Vilnius |year=2009 |volume=4 |pages=803–804 |isbn=5-420-01470-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were collected, organized, and first published in ''[[Scriptores Rerum Prussicarum]]'' as ''Die Littauischen Wegeberichte'' in 1863. The publisher, [[Theodor Hirsch]], was the first to try and match place names in ''Wegeberichte'' with present-day locations. He also numbered and named the routes for easier referencing.&lt;ref name=jurg&gt;{{cite book |title=Kraštas ir žmonės: Lietuvos geografiniai ir etnografiniai aprašymai (XIV– XIX a.) |edition=2nd |year=1988 | first=Juozas |last=Jurginis |author2=Algirdas Šidlauskas |location=Vilnius |publisher=Mokslas |url=http://forum.istorija.net/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=2214&amp;posts=1&amp;start=1 |isbn=5-420-00168-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Lithuanian translation was prepared by [[Jurgis Jurginis]] in 1983, but it contains many inaccuracies.

The '''El Mozote Massacre''' took place in and around the village of [[El Mozote]], in [[Morazán department]], [[El Salvador]], on December 11, 1981, when the [[Salvadoran Army]] killed more than 800 civilians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/08/international/americas/08salvador.html?_r=0 |title=O.A.S. to Reopen Inquiry Into Massacre in El Salvador in 1981 |author=[[Ian Urbina]] |date=March 8, 2005 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvPLtE7n?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/08/international/americas/08salvador.html?_r=1&amp; |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].

In December 2011, the [[Government of El Salvador|Salvadoran government]] apologized for the massacre.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16129116 |title=El Salvador sorry for El Mozote massacre in 1981 |date=December 10, 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvPQYEDT?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16129116 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1981, various left-wing guerrilla groups coalesced into the [[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]] to battle El Salvador's right-wing government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html |title=Enemies of War: El Salvador Civil War |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvTijgOC?url=http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the massacre, unlike many villages in the area, El Mozote had a reputation for neutrality. While many of its neighbors were largely [[Roman Catholic]], and therefore often influenced by [[liberation theology]] and sympathetic to the guerrillas, El Mozote was largely [[Evangelical Protestant]]. The village had sold guerrillas some supplies but was also "a place where the guerrillas had learned not to look for recruits."&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.markdanner.com/articles/the-truth-of-el-mozote |title=The Truth of El Mozote |author=Mark Danner |date=December 6, 1993 |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvSC8Irn?url=http://www.markdanner.com/articles/show/the_truth_of_el_mozote |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the massacre, the town's wealthiest man, Marcos Díaz, had gathered the citizens to warn them that the army would soon pass through the area in a counterinsurgency operation, but he had been assured that the town's residents would not be harmed if they remained in place. Concerned that fleeing the town would cause them to be mistaken for guerrillas, the townspeople chose to stay and extended an offer of protection to peasants from the surrounding area, who soon flooded the town.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

==Massacre==
In his 1994 book, ''The Massacre at El Mozote'', US journalist [[Mark Danner]] compiled various reports to reconstruct an account of the massacre:

===December 10===
On the afternoon of December 10, 1981, units of the Salvadoran army's [[Atlacatl Battalion]]  arrived at the remote village of El Mozote after a clash with guerrillas in the vicinity.&lt;ref name=CTES /&gt; The Atlacatl was a "Rapid Deployment Infantry Battalion" specially trained for [[counter-insurgency]] warfare. It was the first unit of its kind in the Salvadoran armed forces and was trained by United States military advisors.&lt;ref name=NYT38 /&gt; Its mission, ''Operación Rescate'' ("Operation Rescue"), was to eliminate the rebel presence in a small region of northern Morazán where the FMLN had two camps and a training center.

El Mozote consisted of about 20 houses on open ground around a square. Facing onto the square was a church and, behind it, a small building known as "the convent," used by the priest to change into his vestments when he came to the village to celebrate Mass. Near the village was a small schoolhouse.

Upon arrival, the soldiers found not only the residents of the village but also [[peasant|campesinos]] who had sought refuge from the surrounding area. The soldiers ordered everyone out of their houses and into the square. They made people lie face down and searched them and questioned them about the guerrillas. They then ordered the villagers to lock themselves in their houses until the next day and warned that anyone coming out would be shot.&lt;ref name=CTES /&gt; The soldiers remained in the village during the night.

[[Image:Victims_Of_The_Mozote_Massacre,_Morazán,_El_Salvador,_January_1982.jpg|thumb|Victims Of The Mozote Massacre, Morazán, El Salvador, January 1982]]

===December 11 and 12===
Early the next morning, the soldiers reassembled the entire village in the square. They separated the men from the women and children and locked them in separate groups in the church, the convent, and various houses.{{sfn|Danner|2005|p=67}}

During the morning, they proceeded to interrogate, torture, and execute the men in several locations.{{sfn|Danner|2005|p=69&amp;ndash;81}} Around noon, they began taking the women and older girls in groups, separating them from their children and machinegunning them after raping them.{{sfn|Danner|2005|p=78}} Girls as young as 10 were raped, with soldiers reportedly heard bragging how they especially liked the 12-year-old girls.{{sfn|Danner|2005|p=71}} Finally, they killed the children at first by slitting their throats, then by hanging them from trees, with one child as young as two years old.{{sfn|Danner|2005|p=77}} After killing the entire population, the soldiers set fire to the buildings.

The soldiers remained in El Mozote that night but, the next day, went to the village of Los Toriles and carried out a further massacre. Men, women, and children were taken from their homes, lined up, robbed, and shot, and their homes then set ablaze.{{sfn|Danner|2005|p=81}}

== Initial reports and controversy==
News of the massacre first appeared in the world media on January 27, 1982, in reports published by ''The New York Times''&lt;ref name="ny-1982"&gt;{{cite news|author=Raymond Bonner|title=Massacre of Hundreds Reported In Salvador Village|

[[Raymond Bonner]] wrote in the ''Times'' of seeing "the charred skulls and bones of dozens of bodies buried under burned-out roofs, beams, and shattered tiles."&lt;ref name="ny-1982"/&gt; The villagers gave Bonner a list of 733 names, mostly children, women, and old people, all of whom, they claimed, had been murdered by government soldiers.&lt;ref name="ny-1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap-12feb82"&gt;Richard Boudreaux.

Retrieved 2008-05-04.{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alma Guillermoprieto]] of the ''Post'', who visited the village separately a few days later, wrote of "dozens of decomposing bodies still seen beneath the rubble and lying in nearby fields, despite the month that has passed since the incident... countless bits of bones—skulls, rib cages, femurs, a spinal column—poked out of the rubble."&lt;ref name=CJR/&gt;

Both reporters cited [[Rufina Amaya]], a witness who had escaped into a tree during the attack. She told the reporters that the army had killed her husband and her four children, the youngest of whom was eight months old, and it lit the bodies on fire.&lt;ref name="ny-1982"/&gt;
[[Image:Emruins800.jpg|thumb|Ruins of a burned building.]]

Salvadoran army and government leaders denied the reports and officials of the Reagan administration called them "gross exaggerations."&lt;ref name=CJR/&gt; The Associated Press reported that "the U.S. Embassy disputed the reports, saying its own investigation had found... that no more than 300 people had lived in El Mozote."&lt;ref name="ap-12feb82"/&gt;

The conservative organization [[Accuracy in Media]] accused the ''Times'' and ''Post'' of timing their stories to release them just before the congressional debate. Five months later, Accuracy in Media devoted an entire edition of its ''AIM Report'' to Bonner in which its editor [[Reed Irvine]] declared, "Mr. Bonner had been worth a division to the communists in Central America."&lt;ref name=CJR /&gt; Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs [[Thomas Enders]] attacked Bonner and Guillermoprieto before a Senate committee, stating that there had been a battle between guerrillas and the army, but "no evidence could be found to confirm that government forces systematically massacred civilians." Enders also repeated the claim that only 300 people had lived in Mozote, and it was impossible for the death toll to have reached that reported in the ''Times'' and ''Post'' stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/journalism/j6075/edit/readings/mozote.html |title=El Mozote Case Study |author=Stanley Meisler |publisher=Columbia School of Journalism |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvcnrozR?url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/journalism/j6075/edit/readings/mozote.html |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, [[Elliott Abrams]], Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, told the committee that "it appears to be an incident that is at least being significantly misused, at the very best, by the guerrillas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Media, a Century of War |author=Robin Andersen |year=2006 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=9780820478937 |page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jviaAmJL_a8C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=%22it+appears+to+be+an+incident+that+is+at+least+being+significantly+misused,+at+the+very+best,+by+the+guerrillas%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kVpZirJpam&amp;sig=BjXAQaSes2gKeWF6cZUUI-aixmg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hq-WUM6UFobtrQHRlYDYDA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22it%20appears%20to%20be%20an%20incident%20that%20is%20at%20least%20being%20significantly%20misused%2C%20at%20the%20very%20best%2C%20by%20the%20guerrillas%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, in an editorial, "The Media's War", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' criticized Bonner's reporting as "overly credulous" and "out on a limb." In ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, [[William A. Henry III]] wrote a month later, "An even more crucial if common oversight is the fact that women and children, generally presumed to be civilians, can be active participants in guerrilla war. ''New York Times'' correspondent Raymond Bonner underplayed that possibility, for example, in a much-protested January 27 report of a massacre by the army in and around the village of Mozote."&lt;ref name=CJR /&gt; U.S. Ambassador [[Deane Hinton]] called Bonner an "advocate journalist".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Weinraub, "Envoy Says Salvadoran Plan Is Intact," The New York Times, June 12, 1982, 3 (cited in John F. Kirch, "[https://ls2.cmich.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A3=ind0411&amp;L=AEJMC&amp;E=8bit&amp;P=3141815&amp;B=--&amp;T=text%2Fplain;%20charset=iso-8859-1 Raymond Bonner and the Salvadoran Civil War - 1980 to 1983]" presented at the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication in Toronto, Canada, August 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Bonner was recalled to New York in August and later left the paper.&lt;ref name=CJR/&gt;

Although attacked less vigorously than Bonner, Alma Guillermoprieto was also a target of criticism. A Reagan official wrote a letter to the ''Post'' stating that she had once worked for a communist newspaper in Mexico, which Guillermoprieto denied.&lt;ref name=CJR&gt;{{cite web | url=http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/93/1/mozote.asp |title=The Mozote massacre |author=Mike Hoyt |date=Jan–Feb 1993 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071116142355/http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/93/1/mozote.asp |archivedate = November 16, 2007|work=Columbia Journalism Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later investigation ==
On October 26, 1990, a criminal complaint was filed against the Atlacatl Battalion for the massacre by Pedro Chicas Romero of [[La Joya, El Salvador|La Joya]]. Romero had survived the massacre himself by hiding in a cave above the town.&lt;ref name=NYT39&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/world/americas/09amaya.html |title=Rufina Amaya, 64, Dies; Salvador Survivor |author=Douglas Martin |date=March 9, 2007 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvzqCv5P?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/world/americas/09amaya.html |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, as part of the peace settlement established by the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]] signed in Mexico City on January 16 of that year, the [[United Nations]]-sanctioned [[Commission on the Truth for El Salvador]] investigating human rights abuses committed during the war supervised the exhumations of the El Mozote remains by an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] team of [[forensic science|forensic]] specialists beginning November 17. The excavation confirmed the previous reports of Bonner and Guillermoprieto that hundreds of civilians had been killed on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/22/world/salvador-skeletons-confirm-reports-of-massacre-in-1981.html |title=Salvador Skeletons Confirm Reports of Massacre in 1981 |author=Tim Golden |date=October 22, 1992 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvzuNZuT?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/22/world/salvador-skeletons-confirm-reports-of-massacre-in-1981.html |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salvadoran Minister of Defense and the Chief of the Armed Forces Joint Staff informed the Truth Commission that they had no information that would make it possible to identify the units and officers who participated in ''Operación Rescate''. They claimed that there were no records for the period. The Truth Commission stated in its final report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is full proof that on December 11, 1981, in the village of El Mozote, units of the Atlacatl Battalion deliberately and systematically killed a group of more than 200 men, women and children, constituting the entire civilian population that they had found there the previous day and had since been holding prisoner... there is [also] sufficient evidence that in the days preceding and following the El Mozote massacre, troops participating in "Operation Rescue" massacred the non-combatant civilian population in La Joya canton, in the villages of La Rancheria, Jocote Amatillo y Los Toriles, and in Cerro Pando canton.&lt;ref name=CTES&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usip.org/files/file/ElSalvador-Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=From Madness to Hope: the 12-year war in El Salvador: Report of the Commission on the Truth for El Salvador |date=March 15, 1993 |publisher=Commission on the Truth for El Salvador |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Emnewchurch600.jpg|thumb|The newly rebuilt church in El Mozote]]

In 1993, El Salvador passed an amnesty law for all individuals implicated by UN investigations, which effectively exempted the army from prosecution.&lt;ref name=NYT39 /&gt; That year, Danner published an article in the December 6 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''. His article, "The Truth of El Mozote", caused widespread consternation, as it rekindled the debate regarding the United States' role in Central America during the violence-torn 1970s and 1980s. He subsequently expanded the article into a book, ''The Massacre at El Mozote'' (1994). In a prefatory remark, Danner wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That in the United States it came to be known, that it was exposed to the light and then allowed to fall back into the dark, makes the story of El Mozote—how it came to happen and how it came to be denied—a central parable of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1993, a special State Department panel that examined the actions of U.S. diplomats vis-a-vis human rights in El Salvador concluded that "mistakes were certainly made... particularly in the failure to get the truth about the December 1981 massacre at El Mozote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/slatta/hi216/documents/elsal.htm |title=Report of the US Secretary of State's Panel on El Salvador |author=George S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What made the Morazan massacre stories so threatening was that they repudiated the fundamental moral claim that undergirded US policy. They suggested that what the United States was supporting in Central America was not democracy but repression. They therefore threatened to shift the political debate from means to ends, from how best to combat the supposed Communist threat—send US troops or merely US aid?—to why the United States was backing [[state terrorism]] in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On bended knee: the press and the Reagan presidency |author=Mark Hertsgaard |year=1989 |publisher=Schocken Books |isbn=9780805209600 |page=190 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 4, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A later court decision overturned the amnesty for defendants suspected of "egregious human rights violations" but attempts by Salvadoran lawyers to reopen the case repeatedly failed.&lt;ref name=NYT38/&gt;

==Legacy==
On March 7, 2005, the [[Organization of American States]]'s [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] reopened an investigation into the El Mozote massacre based on the evidence found by the Argentine forensic anthropologists.&lt;ref name=NYT38&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/08/international/americas/08salvador.html |title=O.A.S. to Reopen Inquiry Into Massacre in El Salvador in 1981 |author=[[Ian Urbina]] |date=March 8, 2005 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bvzdy0mZ?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/08/international/americas/08salvador.html?_r=0 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2011, activists continued to lobby the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] to hear the case.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

In a January 2007 report in ''The Washington Post'', a former Salvadoran soldier, José Wilfredo Salgado, told of returning to El Mozote several months after the massacre and collecting the skulls of the youngest victims, whose remains were exposed by recent rains, for "candleholders and good-luck charms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/28/AR2007012801353_pf.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Former Salvadoran Foes Share Doubts on War |author=Manuel Roig-Franzia |date=January 29, 2007 |accessdate=May 1, 2010 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvzisZwF?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/28/AR2007012801353_pf.html |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the Salvadoran government formally apologized for the massacre, in a ceremony in the town. Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez, speaking on the government's behalf, called the massacre the "blindness of state violence" and asked for forgiveness.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

In October 2012, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] ordered El Salvador to investigate the El Mozote massacre and bring those responsible to justice. The court ruled that an amnesty law did not cover the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20675619 | work=BBC News | title=El Salvador told to investigate 1981 El Mozote massacre | date=December 11, 2012 | accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ethnic majority''' refers to an [[ethnic group]] that comprises the majority of a particular population. [[Ethnicity]] refers to the mother's tongue and identification with a historical nation or other cultural heritage, as well as with religious traditions and behavioral practices inherited from relatives. A person that was adopted as child from another culture but raised in a domestic family may identify with the ethnic majority of the country. 

An ethnic majority contrasts with those who mainly identify them selves with [[etchnic minority|ethnic minorities]] (official minority languages) of the population, for example [[indigenous people]], or with immigrant ethnicities. A [[national state]] is a state or country that originated from its ethnic majority or [[nation]] ([[nationality]]). Note that a person may identify with several etchnic groups, or with a multi-etchnic culture. 

In anglo-saxic countries, ethnicity as well as race are registered in official statistics, based on self-reported identification by the individual, for example in view to discover discrimination. In for example Scandinavian countries, no official statistics is kept on ethnicity or race. According to the European [[GDPR]] law, it is typically not allowed to register ethnicity or race.

In the context of [[genealogy]], for example [[medical genetics]] or [[genealogical DNA tests]], ethnicity is defined based on biological rather than cultural heritage. However, various genealogical DNA tests result in contradictory and insecure estimates of the ethnic mix of a person, since the result of each test depends on the reference group and how it is divided into ethnic groups. Thus, it is typically not possible to securely determine if a person belongs to the ethnic majority or not using genetic tests. 

Ethnicity is sometimes confused with [[Race (human categorization)|race]], which however is defined based on heritage from a certain continent. The zoological meaning of race cannot be applied to humans since race can not be identified unambiguously from biological features such as skin color. It is disputed to what extent race can be identified using genetics.

'''The Franklin Institute''' is a science museum and the center of science education and research in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. It is named after the American scientist and [[wikt:statesman|statesman]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and houses the [[Benjamin Franklin National Memorial]]. Founded in 1824, the Franklin Institute is one of the oldest centers of science education and development in the United States.

==History==
On February 5, 1824, [[Samuel Vaughan Merrick]] and [[William H. Keating]] founded the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania for the Promotion of the [[Artes Mechanicae|Mechanic Arts]].

:''"…With a view further to develop the resources of the union, increase the national independence, call forth the ingenuity and industry of the people, and thereby increase the comforts of the community at large.    ''' Franklin Institute, opening day 1924, (The Literary chronicle for the Year 1824, p 524)'''''

Begun in 1825, the Institute was an important force in the professionalization of American science and technology through the nineteenth century, beginning with early investigations into steam engines and water power. In addition to conducting scientific inquiry it fostered research and education by running schools, publishing the influential ''Journal of The Franklin Institute'', sponsoring exhibitions, and recognizing scientific advancement and invention with medals and awards.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Stephanie A. "The Dynamics of Change: The Franklin Institute and the Making of Industrial America." ''[http://cisupa.proquest.com/ksc_assets/catalog/3504_FranklinInstituteIndAm.pdf The Franklin Institute and the Making of Industrial America. Guide to the Microfiche Collection]''. Bethesda, MD: CIS Academic Editions, 1987, pp. 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late twentieth century the Institute's research roles gave way to educating the general public through its museum. The Bartol Research Foundation of the Franklin Institute, founded in 1924 to conduct research in the physical sciences, is now part of the University of Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland-Perry, Sherry L. "The Bartol Research Institute: A Brief History." http://www.bartol.udel.edu/wwwroot/history.html Retrieved Jan 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Franklin Institute Laboratories for Research and Development operated from the Second World War into the 1980s.

Many scientists have demonstrated groundbreaking new technology at the Franklin Institute. From September 2 to October 11, 1884, it hosted the [[International Electrical Exhibition of 1884]], the first great electrical exposition in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Jane Mork|date=August 1980 |title=The International Electrical Exhibition of 1884: A Landmark for the Electrical Engineer |journal=IEEE Transactions on Education|volume=23|issue=3|pages=169–176 |issn=0018-9359|bibcode = 1980ITEdu..23..169G |doi = 10.1109/TE.1980.4321403 }}. DOI 10.1109/TE.1980.4321403&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system was later given by [[Philo Taylor Farnsworth]] on August 25, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abramson|first1=Albert|title=The History of Television, 1880 to 1941|date=1987|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=0-89950-284-9|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first female member, Elizabeth Skinner, was elected to membership in 1833. The Franklin Institute was [[Racial integration|integrated]] in 1870, when Philadelphia teacher and activist [[Octavius Catto]] was admitted as a member.

The Institute's original building at 15 South 7th Street, now the home of the [[Philadelphia History Museum|Atwater Kent Museum]], eventually proved too small for the Institute's research, educational programs, and library. The Institute moved into its current home on the [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]], near the intersection with 20th Street, in 1934. The new facility was intended from the start to educate visitors through hand-on interactions with exhibits: "Visitors to this museum would be encouraged to touch, handle, and operate the exhibits in order to
learn how things work."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Funds to build the new Institute and Franklin Memorial came from the Poor Richard Club, the City Board of Trust, the Benjamin Franklin Memorial, Inc., and the Franklin Institute. John T. Windrim's original design was a completely square building surrounding the Benjamin Franklin Statue, which had yet to be built. Despite the effects of the [[Great Depression]], the Benjamin Franklin Memorial, Inc. raised $5 million between December 1929 and June 1930. Only two of the four wings envisioned by Windrim were built; these face the Parkway and share design elements with other cultural and civic structures around [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Circle]].

On March 31, 1940, press agent William Castellini issued a press release stating that the world would end the next day. The story was picked up by [[KYW (AM)|KYW]], which reported, "Your worst fears that the world will end are confirmed by astronomers of Franklin Institute, Philadelphia. Scientists predict that the world will end at 3 p.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] tomorrow. This is no [[April Fool's Day|April Fool joke]]. Confirmation can be obtained from Wagner Schlesinger, director of the Fels Planetarium of this city." This caused a panic in the city which only subsided when the Franklin Institute assured people it had made no such prediction. Castellini was dismissed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/aprilfool/P70 |title=Top 100 April Fool's Day Hoaxes Of All Time |publisher=Museumofhoaxes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2017, during a party hosted by the museum, a partygoer with his companions slipped into a closed-off exhibit of ten [[terracotta army|terracotta warriors]] on loan from China. After his companions left, the partygoer broke off and stole a thumb from one of the warriors. Law enforcement agents later recovered the stolen thumb. The vandalized cavalryman is valued at 4.5 million USD, and is considered a "priceless part of China's cultural heritage". The vandalism stoked outrage in Chinese media such as [[Xinhua]]. The Franklin Institute blamed its external security contractor, and stated it has reviewed its security measures and procedures to prevent such situations from recurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese anger after terracotta warrior's thumb stolen in US|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/19/us/terracotta-warrior-thumb/index.html|accessdate=23 February 2018|work=CNN|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramzy|first1=Austin|title=American Is Charged With Stealing Terra-Cotta Warrior’s Thumb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/world/asia/terra-cotta-warrior.html|accessdate=23 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital Campaign===
[[File:Wright 1911 Model B Flyer - Franklin Institute - DSC06579.JPG|thumb|A 1911 [[Wright Brothers]] Model B flyer.]]
In 2006, the Franklin Institute began fundraising activities for the Inspire Science! capital campaign, a $64.7 million campaign intended to fund the construction of a 53,000 square foot building addition, new exhibits, and upgrades and renovations to the existing Institute building and exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fi.edu/inspire/history.php |title=The Franklin Institute - Inspire Science! - History |publisher=Fi.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Franklin Institute received a $10 million gift from Athena and Nicholas Karabots towards the Inspire Science! capital campaign. This gift is the largest gift in the Institute's history, and put the Franklin Institute within $6 million of the $64.7 million capital campaign goal. The Nicholas and Athena Karabots Pavilion will house not only a $10 million multiroom exhibit on neuroscience, but also a conference center, classroom space, and additional room for traveling exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobrin |first=Peter |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/peter_dobrin/20111002_A__10_million_gift_for_Franklin_Institute__from_a_onetime__bad_kid_.html?ref=facebook.com |title=A $10 million gift for Franklin Institute, from a onetime 'bad kid' |publisher=Philly.com |date=2011-10-02 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Science Center==
The most recognizable part of the Franklin Institute's Science Center is the '''Franklin Institute Science Museum'''. In the spirit of inquiry and discovery embodied by Benjamin Franklin, the mission of the Franklin Institute Science Museum serves to inspire an understanding of and passion for science and technology learning.  Among other exhibits, the Science Museum holds the largest collection of artifacts from the [[Wright brothers]]' workshop.

===Other attractions===
[[File:2008 09 07 - Philadelphia - Budd BB-1 Pioneer 06.JPG|thumb|[[Budd BB-1 Pioneer|Budd BB-1 ''Pioneer'']] in front of museum]]
The Science Center includes many pertinent attractions that are not museum exhibits. The [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer|Budd BB-1 ''Pioneer'']] flying boat, in front of the museum, was the first stainless steel airplane built by the [[Budd Company|Edward F. Budd Manufacturing Corporation]] and has been on display since 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfields-freeman.com/PA/Airfields_PA_Philly_NE.htm] [[Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields]]: Pennsylvania – Northeastern Philadelphia area&lt;/ref&gt;

A mock-up which would eventually become the Lunar Module in the Apollo space program, first shown on display in the 1966–67 World's Fair, held in the New York Hall of Science, is also located on the grounds.  (See [[:File:Apollo lander, Franklin Institute - DSC06612.JPG|photo]].)

====Theaters====
In 1933, [[Samuel Simeon Fels]] contributed funds to build '''The Fels Planetarium''', only the second built in the United States after [[Chicago]]'s [[Adler Planetarium]]. Fully reconstructed in 2002, the Planetarium's new design includes replacement of the original 40,000-pound stainless steel dome, originally built in 1933. The new premium dome is lighter and is {{convert|60|ft|m}} in diameter. It is the first of its kind in the United States. The planetarium is also outfitted for visitors who are hearing impaired.

''The Tuttleman [[IMAX]] Theater'' is an IMAX dome theater that is 180° encompassing and tilted at 30 degrees. The seating places the audience up in the dome which is over {{convert|70|ft|m}} across and 4.5 stories tall. In addition, the theater has 20,000 watts of amplifier power and over 50 speakers.

Early in 2008, extensive renovation of the museum's auditorium was completed. Previously a lecture hall, the space was renamed Franklin Theater, and features 3-D and hi-def [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] digital projection capabilities. The Franklin Theater shows educational films during daytime hours while also including mass release feature-length films.

===Traveling exhibits===
[[Image:Tut steps busy.jpg|thumb|left|During the King Tut Exhibit, the front steps were decorated with an image of [[King Tut]]'s face.]]
In the past, the Science Center has hosted many traveling exhibits including ''Storms'', ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', ''[[Grossology (books)|Grossology]]'', ''[[Body Worlds]]'', ''[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'', and ''Robots''.  In the summer of 2007, the Franklin Institute hosted ''Tutankhamun and The Golden Age of The Pharaohs,'' in the Mandell Center of the Franklin Institute Science Museum.  The exhibit began its United States Tour in [[Los Angeles]], [[California|CA]], and went to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]], and [[Chicago]], [[Illinois|IL]], before coming to [[Philadelphia]] for its final American appearance.  When the exhibit left Philadelphia on September 30, 2007, it traveled to [[London]], England.

This exhibit was nearly twice the size of the original [[King Tut|Tutankhamun]] exhibit of the 1970s, and contained 50 objects directly from Tut's tomb, as well as nearly 70 object from the tombs of his ancestors in The [[Valley of the Kings]]. The show also featured a [[CT Scan|CAT Scan]] that revealed what the Boy King may have looked like.

The Franklin Institute is a member of the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astc.org |title=Association of Science - Technology Centers |publisher=Astc.org |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Alliance of Museums]] (AAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aam-us.org |title=The American Alliance of Museums |publisher=Aam-us.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benjamin Franklin National Memorial===
[[File:Benjamin Franklin National Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|Fraser's]] statue of [[Benjamin Franklin]]]]
{{Main|Benjamin Franklin National Memorial}}

The Benjamin Franklin National Memorial features a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} high marble statue, sculpted by James Earle Fraser.  Originally opened in 1938, the Memorial was designed by architect John Windrim and modeled after the Pantheon in [[Rome]].  The Hall is {{convert|82|ft|m}} in length, width, and height.  The domed ceiling is self-supporting and weighs 1600 tons.  The floors, walls, columns, pilasters, and cornices are made of marbles imported from Portugal, Italy, and France.
The [[United States Congress]] designated the Hall and statue as the official Benjamin Franklin National Memorial on October 25, 1972. The Memorial was dedicated by Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in 1976.

The Benjamin Franklin National Memorial is the only privately owned National Memorial in the country, and it is maintained by the museum.

On December 30, 2005, Congress authorized the Institute to receive up to $10,000,000 in matching grants for the rehabilitation of the memorial and for the development of related exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Parks: Index 2001–2003''. Washington: [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2008, the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial was re-opened after a summer-long restoration that included multimedia enhancements. Philadelphia's most famous citizen is now featured in ''Benjamin Franklin Forever'' - an hourly 3.5-minute multimedia presentation utilizing the entire rotunda.

Also noteworthy is the Franklin Institute's Frankliniana Collection, some of which is on rotating display in the Pendulum Staircase. Highlights include Franklin's 1777 Nini Medallion, the [[maquette|scale model]] of the bust from the statue in the Memorial, the figurehead of Franklin's bust from the ''USS Franklin'', his ceremonial sword used in the court of King Louis XVI, and the odometer that Franklin used to measure the postal routes in Philadelphia. Additionally, the Institute's ''Electricity'' exhibition highlights one of Franklin's lightning rods, his electricity tube, a Franklin Electrostatic Generator, the 1751 publication of Franklin's ''[[Experiments and Observations on Electricity]]'', and [[Thornton Oakley]]'s two 1940 historical murals of Franklin and the "Kite and Key" experiment.

===''The Journal of The Franklin Institute''===
In 1826, ''The Journal of The Franklin Institute'' was established to publish US Patent information and to document scientific and technological achievements throughout the nation.  It is the second oldest continuously published [[scientific journal]] in the country, and is now primarily devoted to [[applied mathematics]].

In 1998 all of the endowed medals were reorganized as the ''[[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]]s''. Multiple medals are given every year, for different fields of science and engineering. The fields awarded today are "[[Chemistry]]", "[[Computer science|Computer]] and [[Cognitive Science]]", "[[Earth Science|Earth]] and [[Environmental Science]]", "[[Electrical Engineering]]", "[[Life Science]]", "[[Mechanical Engineering]]" and "[[Physics]]". In the past also the fields "[[Earth Science]]", "[[Engineering]]" and "[[Materials Science]]" were rewarded.&lt;ref name="About_Awards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Awards_Laureates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fi.edu/winners/sample.faw |title=Franklin Laureate Database |publisher=Franklin Institute |accessdate={{Format date|2011|1|20}}}} Note: Parameter subject is the above described rewarded field.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally since 1990, the ''Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science'' (shortly the ''Bower Science Award'') and the ''Bower Award for Business Leadership'' have been awarded annually. They are funded by a $7.5 million [[bequest]] in 1988 from [[Henry Bower (chemist)|Henry Bower]], who was a chemical manufacturer in [[Philadelphia]]. The Bower Science Award contains $250,000 of cash, one of the largest amounts for a science award in the U.S.&lt;ref name="About_Awards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bower_Awards_Laureates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fi.edu/franklinawards/bower-laureates.html |title=Bower Award Laureates |publisher=Franklin Institute |accessdate={{Format date|2011|1|20}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12595">'''Ghost detainee''' is a term used in the executive branch of the United States government to designate a person held in a detention center, whose identity has been hidden by keeping them unregistered and therefore anonymous.&lt;ref name="Taguba"&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/iraq/tagubarpt.html The "Taguba Report" On Treatment Of Abu Ghraib Prisoners In Iraq: ARTICLE 15-6 INVESTIGATION OF THE 800th MILITARY POLICE BRIGADE], May 2004, ''[[Findlaw]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Such uses arose as the Bush administration initiated the war on terror following the [[9/11 attacks]] of 2001 in the United States. As documented in the 2004 ''[[Taguba Report]]'', it was used in the same manner by United States (US) officials and contractors of the Joint Interrogation and Debriefing Center at the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in [[Iraq]] in 2003-2004.&lt;ref name="Taguba"/&gt;

According to the [[Government of Switzerland|Swiss]] senator [[Dick Marty]]'s memorandum on "alleged detention in Council of Europe states", the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has captured about one hundred persons on European territory and subsequently [[extraordinary rendition|rendered]] them to countries where they may have been [[torture]]d. This number of one hundred [[extraordinary rendition|extraordinarily rendered]] persons is in addition to the estimated hundred U.S. ghost detainees.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_01_06_detention.pdf "Information memorandum II on the alleged secret detentions in Council of Europe states, reported by Dick Marty"], ''BBC'', January 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret CIA prisons (a.k.a. Black Sites)==
{{further|Black site}}
According to then-[[CIA chief]] [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] in 2007, the [[CIA]] had detained up to 100 people at secret facilities abroad (known as [[black sites]]) since the 2002 capture of the suspected [[Al Qaeda]] operative [[Abu Zubaydah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/62199 "CIA Chief Defends Detention of Suspects"], Associated Press, ''New York Sun'', September 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One example is [[Khalid El-Masri]], a [[Politics of Germany|German]] citizen abducted by the [[CIA]] in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] in January 2004. He was taken to a CIA black site in [[Afghanistan]], known as the [[Salt Pit]], for questioning under '[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]' before he was determined to be innocent in March and eventually released in May 2004 after some additional delays. His abduction was said to be a case of mistaken identity. [[Germany]] initially claimed that it did not know of el-Masri's abduction until his return to the country in May 2004. But, on June 1, 2006, the [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] (German intelligence agency) declared that it had known of El-Masri's seizure 16 months before Germany was officially informed of his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/world/europe/02masri.html "German Spy Agency Admits Mishandling Abduction Case"], ''The New York Times'', June 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 report, [[Human Rights Watch]] related the claims of an alleged ghost detainee, [[Marwan Jabour]], a Palestinian who was arrested in [[Lahore, Pakistan]], in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2007/us0207/ [[Human Rights Watch]], ''Ghost Prisoner: Two Years in Secret CIA Detention''], February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have been held for more than a month in a secret detention facility operated by Pakistanis and Americans in [[Islamabad]]. He was flown to a CIA prison in Afghanistan, where he was held in secret, incommunicado detention for more than two years. During his ordeal, he was tortured, beaten, forced to stay awake for days, and kept naked and chained to a wall for more than a month.

At least 39 detainees who were once held by the CIA in secret detention remain "disappeared," according to ''Off the Record,'' a report jointly published June 7, 2007 by six leading human rights groups, including [[Amnesty International]], the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, and [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrgj.org/docs/OffRecord/Off_the_Record_List.pdf "''Off the Record'' List"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614103802/http://www.chrgj.org/docs/OffRecord/Off_the_Record_List.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/06/us-holding-at-least-39-detainees-in.php "US holding at least 39 detainees in secret prisons"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609212620/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/06/us-holding-at-least-39-detainees-in.php |date=2007-06-09 }}, ''Jurist,'' June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Spokesmen say that their report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... reveals the extent to which the United States has illegally used "proxy detention" to empty its secret sites and demonstrates that far from targeting the "worst of the worst," the system sweeps up low-level detainees and even involves the detention of the wives and children of the "disappeared," in violation of their human rights. 'Off the Record' also documents allegations concerning the treatment of detainees while in secret detention, including torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Abu Ghraib's "ghost detainees"==
The practice of ''ghosting'' first achieved widespread attention in 2005 when the ''[[Washington Post]]'' broke a story suggesting that the [[U.S. Army]] and the CIA were detaining "[[unlawful enemy combatants]]" at the Abu Ghraib prison in [[Iraq]] with little or no [[due process]].&lt;ref name="ghost"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25239-2005Mar10.html Josh White, "Army, CIA Agreed on 'Ghost' Prisoners"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article, the CIA asked military intelligence officials to let them house ghost detainees at Abu Ghraib by September 2003 and proposed a Memorandum of Understanding between the agencies on the topic that November. The Army and the [[U.S. Defense Department|Defense Department]] have acknowledged that the United States has used ghosting in the past, but have said it was limited to isolated incidents. According to documents obtained by the ''Post'', "unregistered CIA detainees were brought to Abu Ghraib several times a week in late 2003."&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt;

The Post cited as evidence the 2004 [[Taguba report|report]] by [[Major General]] [[Antonio Taguba]]:&lt;ref name="Taguba"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...  in a report describing abuses of detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, [he] blamed the 800th Military Police Brigade, which guarded the prison, for allowing 'other government agencies' &amp;mdash; a euphemism that includes the CIA &amp;mdash; to hide 'ghost' detainees at Abu Ghraib. The practice, he wrote, 'was deceptive, contrary to Army doctrine, and in violation of international law'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When news of a detainee known only as [[Hiwa Abdul Rahman Rashul|Triple X]] became known to the public in late 2003, [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] was questioned about him.&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Edward T. [https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/040621/21abughraib.htm "Hiding a Bad Guy Named Triple X"], ''[[US News and World Report]]'', June 21, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumsfeld was evasive, and speculated about why someone would want to keep a prisoner hidden from the [[Red Cross]]. This is considered a [[war crime]] under [[jus in bello|international law]].

On September 9, 2004, General [[Paul J. Kern]] testified before the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], stating that an inquiry he led found that the Army had cooperated with the CIA in hiding dozens of ghost detainees from the Red Cross.&lt;ref name=TheJurist040904&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kern told the Committee there may have been as many as 100 ghost detainees.&lt;ref name=TheJurist040904/&gt;

In addition to allegations and reports about ghost detainees in Iraq or East Asian countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, there have been reports that the US had held prisoners in detention centers in some European states. In 2006 the [[Government of Switzerland|Swiss]] senator, [[Dick Marty]] wrote a memorandum on "alleged detention in Council of Europe states." He said the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had captured about 100 persons on European territory and subsequently [[extraordinary rendition|rendered]] them to countries where they may have been [[torture]]d. The BBC reported that this number of 100 [[extraordinary rendition|extraordinarily rendered]] persons is in addition to the estimated 100 U.S. ghost detainees.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The practice has been criticized by [[Amnesty International]] and other [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) as improper and illegal; it prevents these prisoners from having contact with inspectors and [[human rights]] advocates, and the families of the prisoners have to deal with a "[[forced disappearance]]". One 2005 report by Amnesty International indicates that more than 100 ghost detainees may currently be being held in U.S.-operated [[black site]]s.&lt;ref name="2005reprt"/&gt;

In May 2005, Irene Khan of Amnesty International addressed the issue in a speech:   

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to U.S. official sources there could be over one hundred ghost detainees held by the U.S. In 2004, thousands of people were held by the U.S. in Iraq, hundreds in Afghanistan, and undisclosed numbers in undisclosed locations. AI (Amnesty International) is calling on the U.S. government to "close [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] and disclose the rest." What we mean by this is: either release the prisoners or charge and prosecute them with due process."&lt;ref name="2005reprt"&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGPOL100142005 ''Amnesty International Report 2005''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050531222218/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGPOL100142005 |date=2005-05-31 }}, Irene Khan, Speech at Foreign Press Association, ''[[Amnesty International]]'', 25 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Guayaquil Municipal Museum''' ({{lang-es|Museo Municipal de Guayaquil}}) is a museum in [[Guayaquil]], Ecuador. It contains artifacts, objects and historical items relating to the history Guayaquil. It is considered the most important of the city and one of the best in the country. It is located in the center of the city of Guayaquil, in the same building as the Municipal Library.
The museum has its origins in 1863 when an industrial museum was started, making it the oldest in Ecuador, but it wasn't officially until 1908 that the museum was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2008/12/16/1/1380/962A484F5E6B40718D1067992D0882FF.html|title=El Museo dejó su claustro para llegar a la comunidad|publisher=''El Universo''|accessdate=7 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I Am Curious (Blue)''''', whose original [[Swedish language|Swedish]] title, '''''Jag är nyfiken – en film i blått''''', translates as "I Am Curious – A Film in Blue," is a 1968 Swedish film directed by [[Vilgot Sjöman]] and starring [[Lena Nyman]] as a character named after herself. It is a companion film to 1967's ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]''; the two were initially intended to be one 3½ hour film.&lt;ref&gt;Vilgot Sjöman, ''I Was Curious: Diary of the Making of a Film'' ([[Grove Press]], 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; The films are named after the colours of the [[Swedish flag]].

''Blue'' is a second version of ''Yellow,'' taking place before and after the first film. It has a more somber and bitterly [[Satire|satiric]] style, and a further explication of the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] narrative. Questions of [[lesbianism]], [[religion in Sweden|religion]] and critiques of [[meritocracy]] are discussed. 

[[Lena Nyman]] won the award for [[Guldbagge Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress]] at the [[5th Guldbagge Awards]] for her role in this film and ''I Am Curious (Yellow)''.&lt;ref name="5thGuldbagge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?type=PERSON&amp;itemid=65011&amp;iv=AWARDS |title= Lena Nyman |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
After the actress Lena had a sexual relationship with Börje, whose affairs with other women caused her to hate him and question her commitment to [[Martin Luther King]]'s philosophy of [[nonviolence]], she continues to explore her sexuality and politics. She befriends a woman named Sonja, and they travel to [[Ströms vattudal|Ströms Vattudal]] where they enjoy [[nude swimming]] and other excursions. While hiking, Lena also looks into a cabin and sees two women having lesbian sex. Lena returns to [[Stockholm]], where she stays with the couple Hans and Bim. Bim notices Lena scratching herself, which Lena attributes to allergies. After Hans and Bim have an argument, Hans visits Lena in her bedroom. Bim enters with a magnifying glass and insists at looking at Lena's hand. She discovers Lena has [[scabies]], disproving Lena's belief her constant itching owed to allergies and mosquito bites.

Lena approaches Börje in the [[car dealership]] where he now works, to inform him about the possibility that he also has scabies. He confirms he has been itching and accuses her of giving him the disease, citing her [[sexual promiscuity]]. She argues back he is just as promiscuous, resulting in a highly public heated argument. After he loses his job, they both head to the clinic for treatment.

'''''{{lang|es|Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666}}''''' (English: ''The Proceedings of 1666'') is a Spanish document that helped support the [[Marian apparitions|apparition]] of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe|Virgin Mary]] to [[Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin]] at the hill of [[Tepeyac]] in 1531. The apparition is also known today as the iconic [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]. The Proceedings of 1666 consist of a series of investigations, record examinations, testimonies from artists, physicians, and Aztec historians, and oral accounts from elderly men and women who had knowledge and experience with Juan Diego and his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lambretón |first1=A.M. Sada |title=Las Informaciones jurídicas de 1666 y el beato indio Juan Diego. Mexico D.F.: Hijas de María Inmaculada de Guadalupe |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As soon as Bishop Zumárraga and his subordinates viewed Juan Diego’s miraculous [[Tilmàtli|tilma]] painting on December 12, 1531, devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe began. News about the apparition became widespread and many people came to visit the cathedral that would temporarily house the painting. According to Miguel Sánchez’s account of the apparition, when the painting was placed in the cathedral church, “all the city learned of it; and everyone was moved to such a degree that all wanted to see face to face this Miracle so new; and devotion hurried everyone to come together in Christian gatherings.” It would become so popular in the surrounding areas that a hermitage was quickly held on December 26, 1531. This special devotion became such an important part of Mexican life that the local priests began to think about how to ask permission from the Pope for a special Mass and proper office for celebrating the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Unfortunately, little was done about this until Francisco Siles proposed a new plan to the Viceroy of New Spain in 1663.

==Testimony of the painters==
This group of painters consisted of Juan Salguero, Tomás Conrado, Sebastián López de Avalos, Nicolás de Angulo, Juan Sánchez and Alonso se Zarate. These men were well-known, acclaimed artists, and were considered to be masters of painting. After examining the tilma painting, they all came to the conclusion that it was “impossible that any human artist could have painted or created a work so smooth and outstanding and beautifully formed on a fabric so coarse and rough as the tilma.” In addition, these men found that the tilma was painted from the reverse side of the fabric and could not determine whether the painting was done with oil or tempera paints and declared that only the “Lord [their] God alone knows the secret of this work.”

==Testimony of the physicians==
The three physicians called in to examine the image were Don Luis de Cádenas Soto, Don Jerónimo Ortiz, and Don Juan de Malgarejo who were all Physicians-Royal of Mexico. They were brought in to observe how the colors on the tilma could still be so bright after 135 years. They declared that the damp and salty air from Lake Texcoco in conjunction with the hot and humid climate should have caused de-lustering of the image and caused it to dull. On March 28, 1666, the three men declared that the brightness of the image colors could not be explained by natural means.

==Mexican-Indian notable testimonies==
# Marcos Pacheco- An 80-year-old man who was the mayor of [[Cuautitlán]] (Juan Diego’s birthplace) two times. He learned of the apparition from many especially his aunt María Pacheco. His age indicates that he was born fifty-five years after the apparitions.
# Gabriel Suárez- A man who claimed to be more than 110-years-old and was aided by the help of four interpreters. In Suarez’s account, he claimed that he was born in Tequixquinahua and heard all about the account of the apparition from his father Mateo who personally knew Juan Diego. He also heard it from many of the townspeople “who were alive at the time of the Apparitions and attended the ceremonies of the First Procession [and] knew many who had gone to the Hermitage to ask Juan Diego to pray for them.”
# Andrés Juan- A native of Cuautitlán who was believed to be even older than Gabriel Suarez. In his testimony, he claimed that “his family took him to the Hermitage over a hundred years ago, and that the Painting is the one that is now in the new church.” He also claimed that his life was prolonged because the Virgin wanted him to validate her apparition.
# Doña Juana de la Concepción- The 85-year-old daughter of governor Don Lorenzo de San Francisco Haxtlatzontli. In her testimony, Juana claimed that her father made picture chronicles known as mapas and that he carefully compiled all that happened in his section of Mexico. This included the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe because he had known both Juan Diego and his uncle Juan Bernardino. Unfortunately, some thieves broke into his ranch and stole these mapas along with most of his possessions. According to Juana everything that her father put down about the apparition was “heard [by her father] when he was fifteen years old from the mouth of Juan Diego himself, and he portrayed it exactly as Juan Diego had told him.” 
# Don Pablo Xuárez- The 78-year-old governor of Cuautitlán. Testified that his grandmother Justina Cananea personally knew Juan Diego, his wife Maria Lucía, and his uncle Juan Bernardino and that she told him everything about the apparition. He also claimed the miracle “was so public and well-known, how it all happened, that even the children sang all about it in their games.”

==Spanish priest testimonies==
# Fray Antonio de Mendoza- A 77-year-old Augustinian priest of Spanish descent. Heard about the apparition from his parents and grandparents who all lived to be old. His grandfather Alonso de Mendoza was the Spanish captain of the guard around 1580 and knew many people who lived in Mexico at the time when the miracle occurred. 
# Diego de Monroy- A 75-year-old Spanish Jesuit priest. Claimed that after 40 years in Mexico “he had never heard from anyone any variation or doubt expressed.”

==Significance==
According to A.M. Sada Lambretón, the ''Proceedings of 1666'' are very important as proof of the Guadalupe tradition and as support to the life, virtues, reputation and holiness and cult of Blessed Juan Diego. This collection of documents was reviewed during Juan Diego’s canonization in 2002. After a revival of the proceedings in 1723 by Bishop José Pérez de Lanciego Aguilar, the Office of Our Lady of Guadalupe was formally approved in 1894.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3726">'''JavaPOS''' (short for '''Java for Point of Sale Devices'''), is a standard for interfacing [[point of sale]] (POS) software, written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], with the specialized hardware peripherals typically used to create a point-of-sale system. The advantages are reduced POS terminal costs, platform independence, and reduced administrative costs. JavaPOS was based on a Windows POS device driver standard known as [[OPOS]].&lt;ref name=JavaPOS&gt;{{cite web|title=JavaPOS White Paper|url=http://www.javapos.com/downloads/jpos.whitepaper.pdf|publisher=JavaPOS|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; JavaPOS and OPOS have since been folded into a common [[UnifiedPOS]] standard.

==Types of hardware==
JavaPOS can be used to access various types of POS hardware. A few of the hardware types that can be controlled using JavaPOS are
* POS printers (for receipts, check printing, and document [[franking]])
* [[Magnetic stripe card|Magnetic stripe readers]] (MSRs)
* [[Magnetic ink character recognition|Magnetic ink character recognition readers]] (MICRs)
* [[Barcode reader|Barcode scanners/readers]]
* [[Cash drawer]]s
* [[Coin dispenser]]s
* [[Pole display]]s
* [[PINpad]]s
* Electronic scales

==Parts==
In addition to referring to the standard, the term JavaPOS is used to refer to the [[application programming interface]] (API).

The JavaPOS standard includes definitions for "Control Objects" and "Service Objects". The POS software communicates with the Control Objects. The Control Objects load and communicate with appropriate Service Objects. The Service Objects are sometimes referred to as the "JavaPOS drivers."

===Control objects===
The POS software interacts with the control object to control the hardware device. A common JavaPOS library is published by the standards organization with an implementation of the Control Objects of the JavaPOS standard.&lt;ref name=JavaPOS /&gt;

===Service objects===
Each hardware vendor is responsible for providing Service Objects, or "JavaPOS drivers" for the hardware they sell. Depending on the vendor, drivers may be available that can communicate over [[USB]], [[RS232]], [[RS485]], or even an [[Ethernet]] connection. The hardware vendors will typically create JavaPOS drivers that will work with Windows. The majority of vendors will also create drivers for at least one flavor of Linux, but not as many. Since there is not nearly as much marketshare to capture for Apple computers used as POS systems, only a few JavaPOS drivers would be expected to work with Mac OS X. (And those would be more likely due to happy circumstance rather than careful design.)

==Historical background==
The committee that initiated JavaPOS development consisted of [[Sun Microsystems]], [[IBM]], and [[NCR Corporation|NCR]].&lt;ref name=javapos&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History|url=http://www.javapos.com/history.html|publisher=javaPOS|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting occurred in April, 1997 and the first release, JavaPOS 1.2, occurred in March 28, 1998.&lt;ref name=javapos /&gt;&lt;ref name=monroecs&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://www.monroecs.com/javapos.htm|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final release as a separate standard was version 1.6 in July 2001. Beginning with release 1.7, a single standards document was released by a [[UnifiedPOS]] committee. That standards document is then used to create the common JavaPOS libraries for the release.&lt;ref name=monroecs /&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Duggan grew up in [[Glens Falls, New York]], where he became a star [[athlete]] in [[Secondary school|high school]]. Duggan is of [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry. He was raised [[Presbyterian]]. His father was the [[Chief of police]] for the City of Glens Falls.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0240913/bio |title=Jim Duggan (II)|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan was a [[Letterman (sports)|letterman]] in [[American football|football]], [[track and field athletics|track]], [[wrestling]], and [[basketball]].&lt;ref name="Cage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.de/?id=2&amp;nr=1107|title=Cagematch profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; In wrestling, Duggan won the New York State High School wrestling championship, unlimited weight class division – the first wrestler from Glens Falls to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://armdrag.com/matburn?event=8066&amp;instance=9194|title=11th Annual NYSPHSAA Intersectional Wrestling Championships|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduating from high school, he was recruited by [[Ohio State University]], but would instead choose to play [[College football|football]] at [[Southern Methodist University]] (SMU), where he was eventually voted team captain.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt; Duggan earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in applied [[plant]] [[biology]]. After [[college]], Duggan was signed by the [[Atlanta Falcons]] of the [[National Football League]], but was released after being plagued by knee injuries.&lt;ref name="Cage"/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1979-1982) ===
Duggan broke into the professional wrestling business thanks in large part to wrestler [[Fritz Von Erich]]. The two met while Duggan was on a recruiting trip to SMU. Duggan's first professional match was in 1979 against [[Gino Hernandez]]. Duggan began his career as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]]. Training at the Sportatorium in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] as well as with [[Samoa]]n wrestling promoter [[Peter Maivia]], Duggan gained the attention of [[Vincent J. McMahon|Vince McMahon, Sr.]] and the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).&lt;ref name="oww"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/hacksaw.html|title=Accelerator profile|publisher=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief stint with the WWF, Duggan began to work regularly for [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]]. During this time, Duggan was known by two in-ring aliases: in the [[United States]] as '''"Big" Jim Duggan''' and in [[Hawaii]] as '''The Convict''', a masked wrestler. After wrestling for a [[Birmingham, Alabama]]-based promotion, Duggan began wrestling in a promotion based in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] where he adopted his well-known '''"Hacksaw"''' [[nickname]].&lt;ref name="oww"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt;

=== Mid-South Wrestling/Universal Wrestling Federation (1982–1986) ===
[[Image:Jim Duggan 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Duggan at a fan signing for wounded soldiers]]
In 1982, Duggan made his debut in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]]. Upon debuting as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], and [[bounty hunter]] for [[Skandor Akbar]], Duggan soon became a member of the Rat Pack [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|faction]], alongside [[Ted DiBiase]], [[Matt Osborne|Matt Bourne]], and [[Jerry Stubbs|Mr. Olympia]].&lt;ref name=Bodyslamming&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bodyslamming.com/other/hacksaw.html|title=Bodyslamming profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; After newcomer [[Butch Reed|"Hacksaw" Butch Reed]] debuted within the promotion, Duggan and Reed had a [[Kayfabe|personal]] feud for a time over who would be the true "Hacksaw". The Rats also feuded with stars such as Reed, [[Magnum T.A.]] and the [[Junkyard Dog]]. During this time, Duggan interfered in a DiBiase/JYD match while wearing a gorilla suit during the Louisiana State Fair, causing JYD to lose a "[[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|Loser Leaves Town]]" match in [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]]. After DiBiase aligned himself with [[Skandor Akbar]], Duggan refused to go along with him and became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] for the first time in his career. At this time, Duggan began carrying his iconic 2x4.&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt;

As a fan favorite, he won the [[UWF World Tag Team Championship|Mid-South Tag Team Championship]] with Magnum T.A. and later won the [[Mid-South North American Heavyweight Championship|North American Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name="midsouthtag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/midsouth/mswa/mswa-t.html|title=Mid-South Tag Team Championship history|publisher=The Great Hisa's Puroresu Dojo|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="midsouthna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/midsouth/mids-na-h.html|title=Mid-South North American Heavyweight Championship history|publisher=The Great Hisa's Puroresu Dojo|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Mid-South North American title was retired when Mid-South became the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF) in 1986, Duggan lost to [[Terry Gordy]] in a tournament final to determine the first [[UWF World Heavyweight Championship (Bill Watts)|UWF World Heavyweight Champion]]. Duggan then teamed up with [[Terry Taylor]] and won the [[UWF World Tag Team Championship]] for the second time.&lt;ref name="uwftag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/midsouth/uwf/uwf-t.html|title=UWF World Tag Team Championship history|publisher=The Great Hisa's Puroresu Dojo|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After losing a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|Loser Leaves Town match]] to the [[One Man Gang]], Duggan left the UWF for the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).&lt;ref name="oww"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt;

=== World Wrestling Federation (1987 - 1993)===
==== Early feuds (1987) ====
Duggan was signed to the WWF in January 1987, making his first major appearance with the WWF at [[WrestleMania III]], where he also made his [[pay-per-view]] debut. In the weeks preceding WrestleMania, Duggan began his first WWF [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Nikolai Volkoff]]. At the event, he ran to ringside prior to a match between [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]] and [[The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff]] and interrupted Volkoff's pre-match singing of the Russian national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndg.lv/lapa/wrestling/WWF%2085-1999/m87.htm|title=Wrestlemania III Results|accessdate=2008-03-22|quote="The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff vs. the Killer Bees".

On May 26, 1987 Duggan and the Iron Sheik were arrested for DUI in New Jersey. Duggan was on the verge of release from the company, but was ultimately brought back in a lower spot on roster. Although he did not win any major titles in the promotion, for seven years he was a consistent fan favorite with his patriotic gimmick. His character was mainly comical, as he rarely was in major contention for titles. His first major WWF match was at the first-ever [[Survivor Series]] pay-per-view in [[Survivor Series (1987)|1987]], when he participated in the first [[Survivor Series#Survivor Series matches|Survivor Series match]] and was a member of the winning team.&lt;ref name="oww"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1987/results/ |title=Survivor Series 1987 results |publisher=WWE |accessdate=2008-03-22 |quote=Hacksaw Jim Duggan, "Macho Man" Randy Savage, Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat, Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake &amp; Jake "The Snake" Roberts def.

==== First Royal Rumble winner (1988–1989) ====
[[File:Hacksaw Jim Duggan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Duggan in a WWF event]]
By the late fall of 1987, Duggan received his first major [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] since his return, being placed in a feud opposite [[Harley Race|"King" Harley Race]], who was using a monarch gimmick who sneered at wrestlers he thought were below him. Duggan vowed he would never give in to Race's demands to bow to him, and during a televised confrontation, took Race's crown and cape, though Race would later get them back.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} At the [[Slammy Award#1987 Slammy Awards|1987 Slammy Awards]], where Duggan presented the nominees for "Best Ring Apparel," an on-stage shoving match between him and the winner (Race), a wild brawl broke out between the two, going backstage and eventually reaching back to the main stage before interrupting another award presentation and [[Gorilla Monsoon]] stepping in to separate the two. Duggan eventually defeated Race several times in both televised and non-televised shows.&lt;ref name="1988results"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm|title=WWF results, 1988|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duggan participated in the first-ever [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] in [[Royal Rumble (1988)|1988]], where he was the 13th of twenty entrants. He won the match after he last eliminated the One Man Gang.&lt;ref name="oww"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Rumble 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/1988114/results/|title=Royal Rumble 1988 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-22|quote="Hacksaw" Jim Duggan last eliminates One Man Gang to win the Royal Rumble Match (20-man version)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[WrestleMania IV]], he participated in a 14-man tournament for the vacant [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight  Championship]], where he lost to [[Ted DiBiase]] in the first round after interference from [[André the Giant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm4/results/ |title=WrestleMania IV official results |publisher=WWE |accessdate=2008-03-24 |quote=WWE Championship Tournament: Round One Match - "Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase w/Virgil and André the Giant def.

André generally came out the winner in their matches, usually by interference from André's manager [[Bobby Heenan]]. André also interfered in several of Duggan's matches against other wrestlers, including [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]] on the April 30 [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XVI|edition]] of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/1985to1992/april301988|title=Saturday Night's Main Event results - April 30, 1988|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-24|quote=Hacksaw Jim Duggan def. Hercules}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duggan earned a shot at the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] against [[The Honky Tonk Man]] in July 1988, but Honky Tonk got himself disqualified, thus retaining the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlefest88.html|title=Wrestlefest results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-24|quote=IC TITLE MATCH: "Hacksaw" Jim Duggan defeated Honky Tonk Man (Champion) by DQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duggan then began displaying traits of an American patriot by feuding with several [[heel (professional wrestling)|foreign villains]] in the fall of 1988. He got involved in a feud with [[Dino Bravo]],&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt; and the two were on opposing sides as [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]]' team fought André the Giant's at the [[Survivor Series (1988)|1988 Survivor Series]].

==== American patriot (1989–1993) ====
In mid-1989, he started a feud with [[Tonga Fifita|King Haku]], who was awarded the crown on the July 9, 1988 edition of ''Superstars'' when Harley Race was forced to vacate the crown due to injuries sustained in a match against Hulk Hogan on the March 12, 1988 edition of ''Saturday Night's Main Event''.

He eventually lost his crown to [[Randy Savage|"Macho Man" Randy Savage]], who began calling himself "Macho King", and started a feud with Savage. At [[Survivor Series (1989)|Survivor Series]], he captained a team dubbed "The 4x4's" against Savage's team, "The King's Court".

In mid-1992, Duggan was moved to undercard status.&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt; In early 1993, he was involved in a feud with the then near 600 pound [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]], who was the number one contender to the WWF Championship. [[Manager (professional wrestling)|Manager]] [[Mr. Fuji]] was bad mouthing America and Duggan challenged his protégé to a match. The match was promoted by claiming that no one had knocked Yokozuna off his feet, even though Yokozuna had fallen off his feet shortly before, during the 1993 Royal Rumble match. The stipulations to the match were if Duggan knocked Yokozuna off his feet, Duggan would win. On the February 6 edition of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', Duggan won the match after knocking Yokozuna down completely, but then was manhandled by the much bigger Yokozuna after the match and fell victim to four [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Seated senton|Banzai Drops]], sidelining Duggan for about four months.&lt;ref name="oww"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt;

=== World Championship Wrestling (1994 - 2001) ===

====United States Heavyweight Champion (1994)====
After spending a year wrestling independents throughout the Northeast and a tour of Austria for [[Catch Wrestling Association]], Duggan signed a contract with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in the summer of 1994.

==== World Television Champion, Team Canada and departure (2000–2001) ====
{{main|Team Canada (WCW)|l1=Team Canada}}
During this period, he found the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]] in a [[Waste container|trash can]], which had been thrown away by the previous champion [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] earlier and claimed it for himself. He would make title defenses exclusively on ''Saturday Night'', and remained champion until the title was deactivated.&lt;ref name="oww"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wcwtv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="titlehistory"/&gt; After WCW was [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] and the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo storyline]] ended, it was replaced by two new factions in WCW called [[The Millionaire's Club]] and [[the New Blood]], which began feuding with one another.&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt; The Millionaire's Club consisted of veterans and the New Blood consisted of young wrestlers of the 1990s. Duggan joined the Millionaire's Club and helped them in their war against the New Blood.

Near the end of his career in WCW, he became involved in more major storylines, including one that involved him becoming a villain by abandoning the patriotic gimmick for a short time to join [[Lance Storm]] and his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|faction]] [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]].&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt; This angle began when Duggan started working with the [[Misfits In Action]] (MIA) but at [[Fall Brawl (2000)|Fall Brawl]], he turned on MIA's leader U.S. Champion [[Bill DeMott|General Rection]] during Rection's title defense against Team Canada's Lance Storm. Duggan was the [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)#R|special guest enforcer]] for the match, and helped Storm in winning the match.  During this time Duggan shaved his trademark beard, didn't bring his trademark 2x4 to the ring, and sang "O Canada". At [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]], Duggan and Storm teamed up against General Rection in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] for Storm's U.S. Title.

=== Independent circuit and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2005) ===

In the summer of 2008, Duggan started a short feud with [[Cody Rhodes]] and [[Ted DiBiase, Jr.|Ted DiBiase]] after Rhodes and DiBiase tried to convince Duggan to retire and let the young talent run the show. Soon after, Duggan would come out and announce that he would take Rhodes and DiBiase's advice and retire, but [[Jerry Lawler]] stopped him by convincing Duggan to stay. Duggan and Lawler then wrestled Rhodes and DiBiase on the August 25, 2008 edition of ''Raw'', but lost the match. On the October 20 edition of ''Raw'', Duggan confronted [[Santino Marella]] and [[Beth Phoenix]] during one of Marella's tirades against his three possible opponents at [[Cyber Sunday (2008)|Cyber Sunday]] ([[Roddy Piper]], [[Goldust]], and The Honky Tonk Man). Upset at being interrupted, Marella took off his clothes, getting ready to fight Duggan. Yet before a fight could begin, Marella instructed Phoenix to throw the clothes in Duggan's face, a move that temporarily distracted Duggan. Marella then [[Professional wrestling attacks#El Kabong|smashed a guitar]] over Duggan's head, ending the segment. Duggan would appear on ''Raw'''s 800th episode during [[Shoichi Funaki|Kung Fu Naki]]'s in-ring dance segment, which also involved various other members of the WWE roster.

In 2009, Duggan appeared in the [[Royal Rumble (2009)|2009 Royal Rumble match]], entering at #29 and setting a record for the most years between Royal Rumble appearances. He was eliminated from the match by [[Big Show]]. On the August 10 episode of ''Raw'', Duggan made his final televised appearance as [[Sgt.

On November 30, 2013, at WrestleCade 2013, Duggan defeated Daivari.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=101808|title=WrestleCade 2013 « Events Database « CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|last=Kreikenbohm|first=Philip|website=www.cagematch.net|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duggan appears as himself in the film ''[[Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies]],'' in which he battles the undead with his 2x4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Knotts|first=Cody|title=Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies|date=2014-03-28|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2240046/|others=Roddy Piper, Jim Duggan, Matt Hardy|accessdate=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Duggan appeared in the ''[[Harry and the Hendersons (TV series)|Harry and the Henderson]]''{{'}}s TV series' 16th episode.

Duggan appears in the sixth episode of the second season of ''[[GamesMaster]]'' in the UK, where he played WWF on the [[Super Nintendo]] against a boy he picked from the crowd, Hacksaw played as Macho Man Randy Savage and was beaten.

Duggan also appeared in the season five finale of ''[[Duck Dynasty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aetv.com/shows/duck-dynasty/pictures/stand-by-mia/willie-introduces-hacksaw-jim-duggan|title=Stand By Mia - Duck Dynasty {{!}} A&amp;E|work=A&amp;E|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duggan and former WWF announcer [[Sean Mooney]] began recording a weekly podcast on the MLW Radio Network called ''Primetime with Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Sean Mooney''. Duggan left the podcast after 18 episodes leaving Mooney to host the show solo under the new title of ''Primetime with Sean Mooney''.

In 2017, Duggan released the first issue of a biographical comic book miniseries through Squared Circle Comics, titled ''Hacksaw Jim Duggan''.

In 2018, Duggan's trademark "Hooooo!" shout was used in Tuxedo and Zapp's song "Shy" in live performances and on TV appearances.

== Personal life ==
[[File:Hacksaw Jim Duggan 2013.jpg|thumb|Duggan in 2013]]
Duggan and his wife Debra have two daughters, Celia and Rebecca. He is a close friend of [[Willie Robertson]] who owns the Duck Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldnews.com/entertainment/x1465803280/Sullivan-Column|title=Hacksaw Duggan talks about his career, life Wrestling legend thrilled to perform at PAL Hall in Fall River|accessdate=2011-05-01|publisher=Heraldnews.com|date=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Duggan and the Iron Sheik (Khosrow Vaziri) were pulled over by [[New Jersey]] [[police]] before a WWF event, suspecting Duggan of [[driving under the influence]]. After a search of the vehicle and the persons, police discovered that Duggan was under the influence of [[marijuana]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], while Vaziri was high on [[cocaine]]. Small amounts of cocaine were also found in the vehicle. Duggan received a conditional release while Vaziri was placed on probation for a year. The scandal that erupted after two in-ring enemies were found drinking and doing drugs together led to the end of the angle, the Sheik's release, and Duggan's temporary departure from WWF. Duggan soon returned to wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestleview.com/info/faq/duggan.shtml WrestleView.com - Jim Duggan FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/i/iron-sheik.html Online World of Wrestling&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4w-wrestling.com/info/arrestfiles.shtml 4w-Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928181616/http://www.4w-wrestling.com/info/arrestfiles.shtml |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestleinfo.com/IronSheik.html Iron Sheik Wrestleinfo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202011754/http://www.wrestleinfo.com/IronSheik.html |date=2015-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/07/05/1669066.html CANOE - SLAM!

On September 7, 1998, Duggan announced live on [[WCW Monday Nitro]] that he was diagnosed with [[kidney cancer]]. He underwent successful surgery, and because of the cancer was detected very early, no chemotherapy was needed. He wouldn't wrestle again until April 1999.

In November 2013 Duggan started an IndieGoGo campaign to cover the cost repairing his torn rotator cuff. Funding closed December 2013 and raised $10,396; well over the goal of $6,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hoooooo-support-an-american-hero#/|title=Hoooooo!!

'''''Lacrimae rerum''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈlakrimai ˈreːrum|lang}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/rerum
|title=lacrimae rerum
|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary
|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]
|accessdate=2007-12-20
}} The words themselves are from ''lacrima, -ae'', a first declension noun meaning "tear" (appearing here in the nominative plural) and from ''res, rei'' a fifth declension noun meaning "thing" (appearing here in the genitive plural).
&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[Latin]] phrase for "tears of things."  It derives from Book I, line 462 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (c. 29–19 BC), by Roman poet [[Virgil]] (Publius Vergilius Maro) (70–19 BC).  Some recent quotations have included ''rerum lacrimae sunt'' or ''sunt lacrimae rerum'' meaning "there are tears of (or for) things."  

==Background==
In this passage, [[Aeneas]] gazes at a mural found in a [[Religion in Carthage|Carthaginian temple]] dedicated to [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] that depicts battles of the [[Trojan War]] and the deaths of his friends and countrymen. Aeneas is moved to tears and says "sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt" ("There are tears for [or 'of'] things and mortal things touch the mind.")

==Two interpretations==
The [[Genitive case|genitive]] "rerum" can be construed as "objective" or "subjective." The scholar David Wharton observes that the "semantic and referential indeterminacy is both intentional and poetically productive, lending it an implicational richness most readers find attractive." {{sfnb|Wharton|2008|p=259}} In English, however, a translator must choose either one or the other, and interpretation has varied. Those who take the genitive as ''subjective'' translate the phrase as meaning that things feel sorrow for the sufferings of humanity: the universe feels our pain. Others translate the passage to show that the burden human beings have to bear, ever present frailty and suffering, is what defines the essence of human experience. Yet in the next line, Aeneas says: "Release (your) fear; this fame will bring you some deliverance." Those who take the genitive as ''objective'' understand the phrase as meaning that there are tears ''for'' things (in particular, the things Aeneas has endured) evinced in the mural: i.e., the paintings show Aeneas that he finds himself in a place where he can expect compassion and safety.

==Context and translations==
The context of the passage is as follows:
Aeneas sees on the temple mural depictions of key figures in the Trojan War – the war from which he had been driven to the alien shores of Carthage as a refugee: the sons of Atreus (Agamemnon and Menelaus), Priam, and Achilles, who was savage to both sides in the war. He then cries out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"Sunt hic etiam sua praemia laudi;
sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt.
Solve metus; feret haec aliquam tibi fama salutem."

"Here, too, the praiseworthy has its rewards;
there are tears for things and mortal things touch the mind.
Release your fear; this fame will bring you some safety."
Virgil, ''Aeneid'', 1.461 ff.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A translation by [[Robert Fagles]] renders the quote as: "The world is a world of tears, and the burdens of mortality touch the heart."&lt;ref&gt;Willard Spiegelman, ''Imaginative transcripts: selected literary essays'', Oxford Univ. Press, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fitzgerald]], meanwhile, translates it as: "They weep here / For how the world goes, and our life that passes \ Touches their hearts."&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Babuts, ''Memory, metaphors, and meaning: reading literary texts'', Transaction Publishers, 2009, p.173 &lt;/ref&gt;

In his television series [[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]], episode 1, [[Kenneth Clark]] translated this line as "These men know the pathos of life, and mortal things touch their hearts."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNGzoJFj9g8&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Seamus Heaney]] rendered the first three words, "There are tears at the heart of things."&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Heaney, ''Virgil's Poetic Influence'', an essay broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] as part of the Greek and Latin Voices series, 15 July, 2008 (23:00).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The phrase is sometimes taken out of context, on war memorials for example, as a sad sentiment about life's inescapable sorrows. In the poem the phrase appears as Aeneas realises that he need not fear for his safety, because he is among people who have compassion and an understanding of human sorrow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2330">The '''law of contagion''' is a magical law that suggests that once two people or objects have been in contact a magical link persists between them unless or until a formal [[Ritual purification|cleansing]], [[consecration]], [[exorcism]], or other act of [[banishing]] breaks the non-material bond. The first description of the law of contagion appeared in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by [[James George Frazer]]. [[Isaac Bonewits|Bonewits and Bonewits]] have noted parallels in quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonewits|first1=Phaedra|last2=Bonewits|first2=Isaac|title=Real Energy: Systems, Spirits, and Substances to Heal, Change, and Grow|date=2007|publisher=New Page Books|location=[[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]]|isbn=1564149048|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and dangers==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
According to this law, contagion has both dangers and benefits. Benefits, for example, include that the holiness of a [[saint]], [[god]] or other venerated figure confers benefits to [[relic]]s, as do [[temple]]s and [[church (building)|churches]], by virtue of their having [[religious]] [[ritual]]s conducted within them. [[Psychics]] and [[mediumship|mediums]] commonly utilize an object once owned by a missing or deceased subject as their "focus" for [[psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] or [[clairvoyance]] or during [[séance]]s.

Dangers include, for example, a [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] or [[witch]] might acquire a lock of hair, [[nail clipping]] or scrap of clothing in order to facilitate a [[curse]]. [[Voodoo doll]]s resemble the victim and often incorporate hair or clothing from them. In cultures that practice sorcery individuals often exercise care that their hair or nails do not end up in the hands of sorcerers.

==Unconscious belief in the law of contagion==
Even among people who do not profess a belief in magic, [[psychological experiment]]s have shown a reluctance on the part of the public to, say, try on a sweater worn by a [[serial murderer]].{{citation required|date=July 2017}}

The '''NSW Law Reports''' are the [[Law report|official reports]] of the courts of [[New South Wales, Australia]].  The reports are published by The [[Council of Law Reporting for New South Wales]] and cover selected cases heard in the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]].

Each state in Australia has an official body which is responsible for the reporting of cases.&lt;ref name="clr"&gt;{{cite book |title=Concise Legal Research
 |last=Watt |first=Robert |author2=Francis Johns  |edition=6 |year=2009 |publisher=Federation Press |isbn=1862877238 |pages=82–83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EqpxHgFtrt4C |accessdate=27 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the Commonwealth level the responsibility rests with judges.  The [[Commonwealth Law Reports]] are the authorised reports of the [[High Court of Australia]].

Judgements which are included in the reports are selected on the basis their significance in relation to the interpretation, development or application of the law in New South Wales.&lt;ref name="aure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nswlr.com.au/nsw-law-reports-overview/authorised-reports/ |title=Authorised reports |publisher=New South Wales Law Reports |accessdate=27 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 10% of all judgements are eventually selected for publishing.&lt;ref name="pupr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nswlr.com.au/nsw-law-reports-overview/publishing-process/ |title=Publishing process |publisher=New South Wales Law Reports |accessdate=27 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current editor is [[Bret Walker]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|SC}} who has held the position since 2006.

From 1900 to 1950 the reports were known as the State Reports (New South Wales).&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web |url=https://nswlr.com.au/sr-nsw |title=State Reports (NSW)  |date=1900–1950 |via=nswlr.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/ |title=State Reports (New South Wales) |date=1900–1950 |via=Austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSW Law Reports currently holds a monopoly on certain reported cases; these cases are not available to the public (unlike High Court cases, which are freely available to the public). Instead, these cases are licensed out to providers such as Thomson's Reuters, who sell subscriptions to the cases; or they are sold individually on the NSW Law Reports website (for $18 + GST per case).

The '''National Technical Reports Library''' (NTRL) was created by the [[National Technical Information Service]] (NTIS), an agency of the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]], as a means of disseminating scientific and technical information produced by federal and international sources.

The NTRL is an IP-authenticated subscription-based platform which allows subscribers to search the extensive NTIS collection using bibliographic parameters. The NTRL is a useful tool for members of the business, library, government, and academic communities as it provides a solution to locating the results of billions of dollars of federal research on a wide variety of topics, including Aeronautics, Chemistry, Energy, Environment, [[Health care|Health Care]], Library &amp; [[Information science|Information Sciences]], Mathematics, Medicine &amp; Biology, Physics, and Transportation. These are only some of the numerous subjects covered by the NTRL.

The NTRL is an overarching means of accessing over 3 million bibliographic records and over 800K full-text reports.  Searching of documents is available on the Internet for free.  Some documents can be downloaded from the website, but the vast majority of the holdings are only available by subscription.

{{Party politics}}
'''New Right''' is a descriptive term for various [[Right-wing politics|right-wing political]] groups or policies in different countries. It has also been used to describe the emergence of Eastern European parties after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and Soviet-style communism.&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Sean (2007). ''The New Right in the New Europe: Czech Transformation and Right-wing Politics, 1989-2006''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Right by country ==

===Australia===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
In [[Australia]], "the New Right" refers to a late 1970s/1980s onward movement both within and outside of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] which advocates [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and increased [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies (as opposed to the "old right" which advocated [[Economic conservatism|economically conservative]] policies and [[small-l liberal]]s with more [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] views). Unlike the United Kingdom and United States, but like neighbouring New Zealand, the 1980s saw the [[Australian Labor Party]] initiate [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] economic reforms, which bear some familiarity to "New Right" ideology. After the [[John Howard]] Coalition ended the 13-year rule of the [[Hawke–Keating Government|Hawke-Keating]] Labor government at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 federal election]], economic reforms were taken further, some examples being wholesale labor market deregulation (e.g. [[WorkChoices]]), the introduction of a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), the privatisation of the telecommunications monopoly [[Telstra]], and sweeping [[welfare reform]] including "[[work for the dole]]".  The [[H. R. Nicholls Society]], a think tank which advocates full workplace deregulation, contains some Liberal MPs as members and is seen to be of the New Right.

[[Economic liberalism]], also called [[economic rationalism]] in Australia, was first used by Labor's [[Gough Whitlam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/johnquiggin/JournalArticles97/Econrat97.html|title=John Quiggin - Journal Articles 1997 - Economic rationalism|website=www.uq.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a philosophy which tends to advocate a [[free market economy]], increased [[deregulation]], [[privatisation]], lower [[direct taxation]] and higher [[indirect taxation]], and a reduction of the size of the [[welfare state]]. The politicians favouring New Right ideology were referred to as "dries", while those advocating continuation of the economic policies of the [[post-war consensus]], typically [[Keynesian]] economics, or were more socially liberal, were called "wets" (the term "wets" was similarly used in Britain to refer to those [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] who opposed [[Thatcherite]] economic policies, but "dries" in this context was much rarer in British usage).

===Brazil===
The new right in [[Brazil]] has grown sharply in recent years within population, intelligentsia and academia. That is mainly due to a generalized discontent with the {{as of|2018|alt=current}} left-wing government and its policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saad-Filho|first1=Alfredo|last2=Boito|first2=Armando|editor1-last=Panitch|editor1-first=Leo|editor2-last=Albo|editor2-first=Greg|title=Brazil: The Failure of the PT and the Rise of the ‘New Right|journal=Socialist Register|date=2016|pages=213–30|url=https://www.academia.edu/20310392/Brazil_The_Failure_of_the_PT_and_the_Rise_of_the_New_Right_|accessdate=31 August 2016|publisher=London: Merlin Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new movement distinguishes itself from what is known in Brazil as "old right", which was ideologically associated to the [[Brazilian military government]], [[União Democrática Nacional]] (National Democratic Union) and [[Integralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manifesto de 7 de Outubro de 1932
|url=http://www.integralismo.org.br/?cont=825&amp;ox=2|accessdate=23 October 2016|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is identified by positive views regarding democracy, personal freedom, free-market capitalism, reduction of bureaucracy, privatization of state-run companies, tax cuts, [[parliamentary]], political reform. It rejects "[[cultural Marxism]]", [[Socialism of the 21st century]] and [[Populism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberais, Libertários e conservadores, uni-vos|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2014/10/1526258-liberais-libertarios-e-conservadores-uni-vos.shtml|accessdate=23 October 2016|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two major phenomena relating to the rise of the new Brazilian right: the [[Free Brazil Movement]], which has managed to bring together millions of people on demonstrations against the government in March 2015;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saad-Filho|first1=Alfredo|last2=Boito|first2=Armando|editor1-last=Panitch|editor1-first=Leo|editor2-last=Albo|editor2-first=Greg|title=Brazil: The Failure of the PT and the Rise of the ‘New Right|journal=Socialist Register|date=2016|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rfMWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA225|quote=The upper middle class provides the mass base of the new right, for example, through the Free Brazil Movement (Movimento Brasil Livre), MBL, one of the groups leading the demonstrations.|accessdate=31 August 2016|publisher=London: Merlin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of the [[New Party (Brazil)|New Party]] (Partido Novo) and [[Libertários]], the first liberal party since the [[First Brazilian Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interlibertarian.altervista.org/INTERLIBERTARIANS/Brazil.html|title=INTERLIBERTARIANS Members|website=interlibertarian.altervista.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Brazilian new-right thinkers are: [[Kim Kataguiri]], and his movement [[Movimento Brasil Livre]] (Free Brazil Moviment), [[Roberto Campos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biografia
|url=http://www.academia.org.br/academicos/roberto-campos/biografia|accessdate=23 October 2016|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilson Martins (literary critic)|Wilson Martins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1996/12/08/mais!/14.html|title=A certeza da influência|accessdate=7 January 2017|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,morre-o-critico-literario-wilson-martins,504535|title=Morre o crítico literário Wilson Martins|accessdate=7 January 2017|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olavo de Carvalho]],&lt;ref name="filosofiauol"/&gt; [[Luiz Felipe Pondé]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contra os comissionarios da ignorância

As a result of this movement, in the 2018's brazilian election, [[Jair Messias Bolsonaro]] was elected President of Brazil with 55% of the votes, his right hand in economic subjects, [[Paulo Guedes]], graduated from the [[University of Chicago]], will be his Economy Minister.

===Chile===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The term New Right (Spanish: ''Nueva derecha'') has come into mainstream political discourse since the election of [[Sebastián Piñera]] in 2010, when interior minister [[Rodrigo Hinzpeter]] used it to describe his government. Hinzpeter's introduction of the term caused a buzz among newspapers, politicians and analysts. According to a column published in ''[[The Clinic (newspaper)|The Clinic]]'', the New Right is different from the old [[military dictatorship|dictatorial]] right of [[Augusto Pinochet]], in the sense that it embraces democracy. It is also different from the religiously conservative [[Unión Demócrata Independiente]] party, in that it is more open to discussing issues like [[divorce]]. According to the same analysis, the New Right is becoming increasingly pragmatic, as shown by their decision to increase taxes following the [[2010 Chilean earthquake]].

===France===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
In [[France]], the New Right (or ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'') has been used as a term to describe a modern think-tank of French political philosophers and intellectuals led by [[Alain de Benoist]]. Another noted intellectual, who was once part of Alain de Benoist's GRECE, is [[Guillaume Faye]]. Although accused by some critics as being "[[far-right]]" in their beliefs, they themselves claim that their ideas transcend the traditional [[left–right politics|left–right divide]] and actively encourages free debate. France also has one Identitarian New Right group (which is connected with Thule Seminar in Germany); that is Terre et Peuple of Pierre Vial, who was once an integral part and founding member of Alain de Benoist's GRECE.

===Germany===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
In Germany, the ''[[Neue Rechte]]'' (literally, new right) consists of two parts: the ''Jungkonservative'' (literally, young conservatives), who search for followers in the civic part of the population; and, secondly, the "Nationalrevolutionäre" (national revolutionists), who are looking for followers in the ultra-right part of the German population, and use the rhetoric of right-wing politicians such as [[Strasserism#Strasser brothers|Gregor and Otto Strasser]]. Another noted New Right group in Germany is Thule Seminar of Pierre Krebs.

===Greece===
[[Failos Kranidiotis]], a [[Greeks|Greek]] politician who had been expelled by [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] chairman [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] for expressing views more similar to political rival [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] than those of former [[Prime Minister of Greece]] [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] whose legacy expressed the most important principle of its recently elected leadership, including [[Adonis Georgiadis]] who had been a member only since leaving [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] in 2012, instead of those expressed by the previous heads of the party who had close friendships with him, specifically [[Kostas Karamanlis]], [[Antonis Samaras]] and [[Vangelis Meimarakis]], founded the [[New Right (Greece)|New Right]] party based on [[National liberalism|national liberalism]] in May 2016.

===Netherlands===
The [[New Right (Netherlands)|New Right]] (NR) was the name of a far-right/nationalist political party in the Netherlands from 2003 to 2007.  The [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV), founded in 2005 and led by [[Geert Wilders]], also is a New Right movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard Delanty|title=Identity, Belonging and Migration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rMgCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=262|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2017 [[Forum voor Democratie]] is another new right party in the Dutch parliament.

===New Zealand===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
In [[New Zealand]], as in Australia, it was the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] that initially adopted "New Right" economic policies. "[[Rogernomics]]" involved [[monetarism|monetarist]] approaches to controlling inflation, corporatisation of government departments, and the removal of [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]], while the party also pursued social liberal stances such as decriminalisation of male homosexuality, pay equity for women and adopting a nuclear-free policy. This meant temporary realignment within New Zealand politics, as "New Right" middle-class voters voted Labour at the [[New Zealand general election, 1987]] in approval of its economic policies. At first, Labour corporatised many former government departments and state assets, then emulated the Conservative [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] administration and privatised them altogether during Labour's second term of office. However, recession and privatisation together led to increasing strains within the Labour Party, which led to schism, and the exit of [[Jim Anderton]] and his [[NewLabour Party (New Zealand)|NewLabour Party]], which later formed part of the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance Party]] with the Greens and other opponents of New Right economics.

However, dissent and schism were not to be limited to the Labour Party and Alliance Party alone. During the Labour Party's second term in office, the Opposition [[New Zealand National Party]] (popularly known as 'National') selected [[Ruth Richardson]] as Opposition finance spokesperson, and when National won the [[New Zealand general election, 1990|1990 general election]], Richardson became Minister of Finance, while [[Jenny Shipley]] became Minister of Social Welfare. Richardson introduced deunionisation legislation, known as the Employment Contracts Act, in 1991, while Shipley presided over social welfare benefit cuts, designed to reduce "[[welfare dependency]]" – both core New Right policy initiatives.

In the early nineties, maverick National Party MP [[Winston Peters]] also came to oppose New Right economic policies, and led his elderly voting bloc out of the National Party. As a result, his [[New Zealand First]] anti-monetarist party has been a partner in coalition governments led by both National (1996–98) and Labour (2005–08 and 2017-ongoing). Due to the introduction of the [[Electoral system of New Zealand|MMP]] electoral system, a New Right "Association of Consumers and Taxpayers" party, known as [[ACT New Zealand]], was formed by ex-Labour New Right-aligned Cabinet Ministers like [[Richard Prebble]] and others, and maintaining existing New Right policy initiatives such as the Employment Contracts Act, while also introducing US-style "[[welfare reform]]." ACT New Zealand aspired to become National's centre-right coalition partner, but has been hampered by lack of party unity and populist leadership that often lacked strategic direction.

As for Labour and National themselves, their fortunes have been mixed. Labour was out of office for most of the nineties, only regaining power when [[Helen Clark]] led it to victory and a Labour/Alliance coalition and centre-left government (1999–2002). However, the Alliance disintegrated in 2002.

National was defeated in 1999 due to the absence of a suitable stable coalition partner, given New Zealand First's partial disintegration after Winston Peters abandoned the prior National-led coalition. When [[Bill English]] became leader of National in 2001, it was thought that he might lead the party away from its prior hardline New Right economic and social policies, but his indecisiveness and lack of firm policy direction led to ACT New Zealand gaining the New Right middle-class voting basis in 2002. When [[Don Brash]] became leader, New Right middle-class voters returned to National's fold, causing National's revival in fortunes at the [[New Zealand general election, 2005]]. However, at the same time, ACT New Zealand strongly criticised it for deviating from its former New Right economic policy perspectives, and at the same election, National did little to enable ACT's survival. Don Brash resigned as National party leader, being replaced by [[John Key]], who was a more moderate National MP.

As for the centre-left, Helen Clark and her Labour-led coalition were criticised by ex-Alliance members and non-government organisations for their alleged lack of attention to centre-left social policies, while trade union membership recovered due to Labour's repeal of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 and [[Labour market flexibility|labour market deregulation]] and the deunionisation that had accompanied it in the nineties. It is plausible that Clark and her Cabinet were influenced by [[Tony Blair]] and his British Labour Government, which pursued a similar balancing act between social and fiscal responsibility while in government.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== South Korea ===
In [[South Korea]], the [[New Right (South Korea)|South Korean New Right]] movement is a Korean attempt at [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] politics. The [[Lee Myung-bak government]] led by President [[Lee Myung-bak]] and the conservative [[Grand National Party]] is noted for being a benefactor of the domestic New Right movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yin-wah Chu|author2=Siu-lun Wong|title=East Asia’s New Democracies: Deepening, Reversal, Non-liberal Alternatives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyXGBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT199|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|page=199|isbn=9781136991097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Thatcherism}}
In the United Kingdom, the term New Right more specifically refers to a strand of Conservatism that the likes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan influenced. Thatcher's style of New Right ideology, known as [[Thatcherism]], was heavily influenced by the work of [[Friedrich Hayek]] (in particular the book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]''). They were ideologically committed to [[economic liberalism]] as well as being [[social conservatism|socially conservative]]. Key policies included deregulation of business, a dismantling of the welfare state, privatization of nationalized industries and restructuring of the national workforce in order to increase industrial and economic flexibility in an increasingly global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.

===United States===

{{Libertarianism in the United States sidebar}}
{{main article|Conservatism in the United States}}
{{seealso|Neoconservatism}}
In the United States, New Right refers to three historically distinct [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political movements.&lt;ref name=Frohnen&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia''. ISI Books: Wilmington, DE.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|624–25}} These American New Rights are distinct from and opposed to the more moderate tradition of the so-called [[Rockefeller Republican]]s. The New Right also differs from the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] (1933–55) on issues concerning foreign policy with [[neoconservatives]] being opposed to the [[United States non-interventionism|non-interventionism]] of the Old Right.&lt;ref name= Frohnen/&gt;{{rp|625}}

==== First New Right ====
The first New Right (1955–64) was centered around the [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]], [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|traditionalists]], and [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] at William F. Buckley's ''[[National Review]]''.&lt;ref name=Frohnen/&gt;{{rp|624}} Sociologists and journalists had used ''new right'' since the 1950s; it was first used as self-identification in 1962 by the student activist group [[Young Americans for Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Viguerie, Richard]]. ''The New Right: We're Ready to Lead''. 1981, Caroline House, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The first New Right embraced "[[fusionism]]" ([[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] economics, traditional social values, and an ardent anti-communism)&lt;ref name=Frohnen/&gt;{{rp|338–41}} and coalesced through [[grassroots]] organizing in the years preceding the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential campaign]] of [[Barry Goldwater]]. The Goldwater campaign, though failing to unseat incumbent President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], galvanized the formation of a new political movement.

'''First New Right figures''':
* [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] – editor of ''National Review''
* [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]] – anti-communist libertarian and creator of the "fusionist" political theory
* [[James Burnham]] – anti-communist political theorist
* [[M. Stanton Evans]] – journalist and writer of Young Americans for Freedom's [[Sharon Statement]]
* [[Barry Goldwater]] – U.S. Senator from Arizona and Republican U.S. presidential candidate

==== Second New Right ====
The second New Right (1964–2014) was formed in the wake of the Goldwater campaign and had a more [[Right-wing populism|populist]] tone than the first New Right. The second New Right tended to focus on emotional, wedge issues (such as abortion) and was often linked with the [[Christian right|Religious Right]].&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried, Paul and Thomas Fleming (1988) ''The Conservative Movement''. Twayne Publishers: Boston, pp. 77–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The second New Right formed a policy approach and electoral apparatus that brought [[Ronald Reagan]] into the [[White House]] in the 1980 presidential election. The New Right was organized in the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and [[The Heritage Foundation]] to counter the so-called "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] establishment". In elite think tanks and local community organizations alike, new policies, marketing strategies, and electoral strategies were crafted over the succeeding decades to promote strongly conservative policies.&lt;ref&gt;Arin, Kubilay Yado: ''Think Tanks, the Brain Trusts of US Foreign Policy''. Wiesbaden: VS Springer 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Second New Right figures''':

* [[Paul Weyrich]] – founder of the [[Heritage Foundation]] and the Free Congress Foundation
* [[Ronald Reagan]] – President of the United States

==== Third New Right ====
Since 2014, the term 'New Right' has been used to describe the sudden wave of [[Conservatism in the United States|young conservative]], [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]], [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[alt-lite]], and supporters of President [[Donald Trump]]. This emergence came in reaction to a perceived rise in social [[Progressivism in the United States#Progressivism in the 21st century|progressivism]], the [[big government]] policies of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama presidency]], [[Social justice warrior|PC culture]] in places of [[higher education]], [[Frankfurt School#Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory|cultural marxism]] in [[popular culture]], liberal bias in the [[Media bias|mainstream media]], and the rise of [[American Left#Social democratic and democratic socialist|democratic socialism]] and [[globalism]]. This third wave of the new right share a number of the views of the [[alt-right]], but reject its [[racialism]], [[Antisemitism in the United States|antisemitism]] and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/alt-right-and-alt-lite-conservatives-plan-dueling-conservative-rallies-sunday-in-dc/2017/06/22/242d8de2-56bd-11e7-9fb4-fa6b3df7bb8a_story.html|title=‘Alt-right’ and ‘alt-lite’?

The '''Olympic Sculpture Park''', created and operated by the [[Seattle Art Museum]], is a park, free and open to the public, in [[Seattle, Washington]] that opened on January 20, 2007. The park consists of a {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} outdoor [[sculpture]] museum and beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/parks/parkspaces/OlympicSculpturePark.htm|title=Seattle Parks Department official site|publisher=City of Seattle|year=2013|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park's lead designer was [[Weiss/Manfredi]] Architects,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/arts/design/14shee.html?pagewanted=1&amp;n=Top/News/Business/Companies/Washington%20Mutual%20Inc.&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; who collaborated with [[Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture]], [[Magnusson Klemencic Associates]] and other consultants.  It is situated at the northern end of the Seattle seawall and the southern end of [[Myrtle Edwards Park]]. The former industrial site was occupied by the oil and gas corporation [[Unocal]] until the 1970s and subsequently became a contaminated [[brownfield]] before the Seattle Art Museum proposed to transform the area into one of the only green spaces in [[Downtown Seattle]].

As a free-admission outdoor [[sculpture park]] with both permanent and visiting installations, it is a unique institution in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=serra25&amp;date=20060725|title="There's nothing else like this in the country" for outdoor art, says artist|publisher=''Seattle Times''|date=July 25, 2006|accessdate=2007-01-22|author=Sheila Farr, Seattle Times art critic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of green space for large, monumental sculpture in Seattle was first discussed between Virginia and [[Bagley Wright]], Mary and [[Jon Shirley]] (former president of [[Microsoft]] and Chairman of the Seattle Art Museum Board of Directors), and Seattle Art Museum director (and wife of [[William H. Gates, Sr.|William Gates Sr.]]) [[Mimi Gardner Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Olympic Sculpture Park|last=Corrin|first=Lisa Graziose|last2=Gates|first2=Mimi Gardner|publisher=Seattle Art Museum|year=2007|isbn=0932216579|location=Seattle|pages=10–12|via=Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea grew further during a discussion in 1996 between Robert Measures and [[Martha Wyckoff]] while stranded on a fly fishing trip in [[Mongolia]] due to a helicopter crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/visualart/217823_mimigates.htmldate=20050329|title=Mimi Gates, Seattle Art Museum's director, doesn't shy away from a challenge|publisher=''Seattle Post Intelligencer''|date=March 29, 2005|accessdate=2007-11-01|author=Regina Hackett}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GatesCatalog"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner Gates | first = Mimi | authorlink = Mimi Gardner Gates | title = Olympic Sculpture Park | publisher = [[Seattle Art Museum]] | date = 207 | pages = 10–12, 63 | isbn = 3-540-63293-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wyckoff, being a trustee of the [[Trust for Public Land]], soon after began an effort to identify possible locations for the park.&lt;ref name="GatesCatalog" /&gt;

A $30 million gift from Mary and Jon Shirley established them as foundational donors.&lt;ref name="GatesCatalog" /&gt; As part of constructing the sculpture park, 5.7 million dollars were spent transforming {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of the [[seawall]] and underwater shoreline inside Myrtle Edwards park. A three level underwater slope was built with 50,000 tonnes of [[riprap]].  The first level of the slope is large rocks to break up waves. The second is a flat "bench" level to recreate an [[intertidal zone]]. The lower level is covered with smaller rocks designed to attract sealife and large [[kelp]]. It is hoped that this recreated strand will help revitalise juvenile salmon from the [[Duwamish River]] and serve as a test for future efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seattle Times Research with the Seattle Art Museum|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/news/local/sculpturepark/seawall.html|title=The seawall&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Changing the landscape under water|publisher=''Seattle Times''|date=15 January 2007|accessdate=2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintenance of the sculptures has been an ongoing issue. The environment near a large [[seawater|salt water]] body has been corrosive to pieces like ''Bunyon's Chess'', made primarily of exposed wood and metal. Tall painted pieces such as ''[[Eagle (Calder)|Eagle]]'' need to be watched for damage from birds and their waste. Maintenance of these large structures is expensive, requiring [[scaffolding]] or [[boom lift]]s. The paint on ''Eagle'' is also easily damaged by the mechanical clipping of grass near the base of its installation, requiring the gardeners to use scissors instead of a lawn mower near the sculpture.&lt;ref name="MaintenanceTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2004116768_sculpture10.html|title=Art at Sculpture Park is a touchy subject|publisher=''Seattle Times''|date=January 10, 2008|accessdate=2008-03-04|author=Stuart Eskenazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reception==
Prior to and during the park’s opening in 2007, the project received positive reviews from many regional and national press sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sculpturepark/?spotlightname=sculpturepark_st&amp;spotlightquery=%22olympic+sculpture+park%22|title=Olympic Sculpture Park Guide|work=Seattle Times|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Take+back+the+site%3a+Valerie+Smith+on+the+Olympic+Sculpture+Park.-a0152514797|title=Take Back The Site: Valerie Smith on the Olympic Sculpture Park|work=ArtForum|first=Valerie|last=Smith|date=September 2006|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sculpturepark/2003524511_sculpturepark140.html|title=Stunning sculpture park could redefine waterfront|work=Seattle Times|date=2007-01-14|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/arts/design/14shee.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Where%20Money%E2%80%99s%20No%20Object,%20Space%20is%20no%20Problem&amp;st=cse|title=Where money's no object, space is no problem|first=Hilarie|last=Sheets|work=The New York Times|date=2007-01-14|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/15/nation/na-sculpture15|title=Transformed by a creative use of space|first=Sam|last=Verhovek|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-01-15|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/15/news/sculpt.php|title=On the waterfront: Money and vision give Seattle a bold new vista|work=International Herald Tribune|date=2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sculpturepark/2003528358_waterfront17m.html|title=Seattle trying to woo salmon back downtown|work=Seattle Times|date=2007-01-16|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580397,00.html|title=Walk on the Wild Side|first=Richard|last=Lacayo|work=Time|date=2007-01-18|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117020910866193144?mod=weekend_leisure_banner_left|title=From toxic wasteland to public garden with view|first=Douglas|last=Gantebein|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2007-01-31|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Olympic Sculpture Park has now become an icon for Seattle.

==Criticism==
Before the construction of the Olympic Sculpture Park began, there was substantial criticism in the community that the new park would result in the complete shutdown of the [[Waterfront Streetcar]], a fixture of the Seattle waterfront since 1982, because of the park's needed demolition of the streetcar's maintenance and storage facility. The storage and maintenance building was located on a portion of the park's proposed site, and the new park was not designed to either incorporate the existing building or construct a replacement facility. As a result, the streetcar "carbarn" was demolished and the line shut down in November 2005, despite an offer by the staff of the [[Waterfront Streetcar]] to modify the carbarn into a sculpture to fit into the park, the route being named, by National Geographic Society, as one of the 10 Great Streetcar routes,&lt;ref&gt;http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/trolley-rides/&lt;/ref&gt; and its great popularity with tourists and locals. A new facility has been proposed to be built in [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]] to allow the route to reopen in the future. As of 2013, King County Metro, and City of Seattle fail to implement a plan for said new carbarn.

As soon as the park opened it was also criticized by the public for two policies that seemed to conflict with the easy public accessibility of an open-air museum: "Don't Touch" and "Limited Photography". The park hired [[security guard|security officers]] to enforce these rules.

On its weekend opening, both major local papers, the [[Seattle Times]] and the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] ran articles about the museum's "Don't Touch" policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danny Westneat, Seattle Times|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003548807_danny31.html|title=Getting touchy about art|publisher=''Seattle Times''|date=31 January 2007|accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Regina Hackett, Seattle PI Art Critic|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/visualart/301331_park27.html|title=Olympic Sculpture Park: It's not a hands-on experience|publisher=''Seattle Post-Intelligencer''|date=27 January 2007|accessdate=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The policy was instituted by Chief Conservator Nicholas Dorman to protect the pieces from damage, not just from scratching and vandalism, but long-term changes caused by oils left by human contact.  The largest and one of the most accessible pieces, ''Wake'' by Richard Serra, has a delicate patina of rust that could be protected by a coating but has not because it conflicts with the museum's ideal to present and preserve the piece in its purest form.

One of the park's prominent pieces, ''Typewriter Eraser, Scale X'' by [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Coosje van Bruggen]], is on three-year loan from its owner, [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Percy Allen|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=allen06&amp;date=20060706|title=Allen loans massive "Eraser"|publisher=''Seattle Times''|date=6 July 2006|accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other sculptures in the park, there was initially a posted sign indicating that the public does not have [[Freedom of panorama|permission to photograph this sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jen Graves|url=http://www.thestranger.com/blog/2007/01/the_stranger_arrested|title=''The Stranger'' Arrested|publisher=''Slog'' (''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'s'' blog)|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of its current position alongside Elliott Avenue, a major street running through the park.  After some criticism, the prohibition was lifted, with a Seattle Art Museum spokesperson claiming it was "a misinterpretation of the loan agreement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jen Graves|url=http://www.thestranger.com/blog/2007/01/sculpture_park_hangover|title=Sculpture Park Hangover|publisher=''Slog'' (''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'s'' blog)|date=22 January 2007|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The text prohibiting photography was subsequently covered up with masking tape.

Much of the sculpture comes from local collections or were specifically commissioned for the park. Some of the donated pieces have been referred to as the "equivalent of an unwanted birthday present left on the curb for charity."  By commissioning sculptures, the park has been criticized for placing art that does not have "staying power" by artists who have not proven their worth. The piece ''Stinger'', ostensibly by artist [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], has caused debate among artists and critics because it was created twenty years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sheila Farr, Seattle Times art critic|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sculpturepark/2003529633_sculpturereview18.html|title=A critic's-eye view of the new Olympic Sculpture Park|publisher=''Seattle Times''|date=24 January 2007|accessdate=2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a few undisclosed owners of a select sculptures have stated that they, in fact, had no desire to keep their sculptures, and use the park simply as a tax write-off.

'''Papa Legba''' is a [[loa]] in [[Haitian Vodou]], who serves as the intermediary between the loa and humanity. He stands at a spiritual crossroads and gives (or denies) permission to speak with the spirits of [[Guinee]], and is believed to speak all human languages. In Haiti, he is the great elocutioner. Legba facilitates communication, speech, and understanding.

==Appearance==
He usually appears as an old man on a crutch or with a cane, wearing a broad brimmed straw hat and smoking a pipe, or sparkling water. The [[dog]] is sacred to him. Legba is syncretized with [[Saint Peter]], [[Rich man and Lazarus|Saint Lazarus]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=legba+st.+lazarus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=utaNTsGVM-PY0QH6uIUQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=legba%20st.%20lazarus&amp;f=false Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction by Brian Morris, pg. 196.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/aa.1937.39.4.02a00080 | volume=39 | issue=4 | title=African Gods and Catholic Saints in New World Negro Belief | journal=American Anthropologist | pages=635–643| year=1937 | last1=Herskovits | first1=Melville J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative views==
In [[Benin]],  [[Nigeria]] and [[Togo]], Legba is viewed as young and virile, is often horned and phallic, and his shrine is usually located at the gate of the village in the countryside. Alternatively, he is addressed as Legba Atibon, Atibon Legba, or Ati-Gbon Legba.

==In popular culture==
In the 1949 novel [[The Kingdom of This World]], by [[Alejo Carpentier]], Solimán gives Pauline Bonaparte a Papa Legba mascot for a safe journey back to Europe because of the Yellow Fever outbreak. Later, when in Rome, the ill Solimán tries to reach for the god Legba. Also in this novel, Papa Legba is referred to as "the Lord of the Roads," in the scene where Ti Noel discovers a large gnarled tree that is comparable to Legba's crutches after freeing himself from slavery. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carpentier|first1=Alejo|title=The Kingdom of This World|date=2017|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=9780374537388|page=103|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1972 novel, ''[[Mumbo Jumbo (novel)|Mumbo Jumbo]]'', by [[Ishmael Reed]], the main character is a Voodoo priest named Papa Labas after Papa Legba.

In his study of the [[Delta blues]], [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] discusses the appearance of Legba in blues lyrics and lore. Palmer notes that Legba can be referred to/identified as "the Devil", "Papa Legba", and "The Black Man" throughout the history of the blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Palmer|date=1981|title=Deep Blues: A Musical and Cultural History of the Mississippi Delta|location=New York|publisher=Penguin|pages=60, 126|isbn=978-0-1400-6223-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is also made clear in ethnomusicologist [[Bruno Blum]]'s text for the CD box set ''Voodoo in America'' (scroll for English version) &lt;ref&gt;https://www.fremeaux.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.livrets&amp;content_id=7008&amp;product_id=1380&amp;category_id=34&lt;/ref&gt;, where reference to Papa Legba, deity of roads and crossroads, in [[Robert Johnson]]'s iconic song "Crossroads" is explained.

In the 1983 novel [[Praisesong for the Widow|''Praisesong for the Widow'' by Paule Marshall]], Part III ("Lavé Tête"), Papa Legba appears in disguise to guide the heroine Avey Johnson when she has arrived at a crucial crossroad in her life.

In 1982, [[Elton John]] released a UK [[B-side]] titled "Hey, Papa Legba," with lyrics by longtime collaborator [[Bernie Taupin]]. The musical groups [[Talking Heads]], [[The Smalls]], [[Angel (band)|Angel]], [[Sun City Girls]], and [[Rodney Orpheus|Sun God]] have also made songs named after him.  The Talking Heads song can be found on their 1986 album (and soundtrack to the [[David Byrne]] [[True Stories (film)|film of the same name]]), ''[[True Stories (Talking Heads album)|True Stories]]''; the Talking Heads song has been covered regularly by [[Widespread Panic]], whose performance of the song can be heard on their live album, [[Light Fuse, Get Away]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widespreadpanic.com/album.php?id=35 Widespread Panic official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1985 episode of the TV series ''Miami Vice'' (Season 2, Episode 8, "Tale of the Goat") centers around a malign Vodou priest by the name of Papa Legba (played by [[Clarence Williams III]]). In keeping with the image of Legba often conceptualised in Haitian Vodou subculture, Papa Legba is depicted as "controlling" the gateway to the spiritual world (through the use of drugs), walking with the aid of crutches,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IIB0Yu_sL4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=legba+crutches&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GtSNTuSeCMre0QHGoqlJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cruches&amp;f=false The Haitian Vodou Handbook: Protocols for Riding with the Lwa By Kenaz Filan]&lt;/ref&gt; and smoking a pipe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nYwhMipCK9EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=legba&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gtONTqPeGKPv0gGG67Eu&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=crutches&amp;f=false/ ''Looking for Mr. Legba'' By Richard Laister, pg. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is extensive referencing to Voodoo in the [[Sprawl trilogy]] by [[William Gibson]]. In the second book, ''[[Count Zero]]'', Papa Legba stands at the gateway to cyberspace as the "master of roads and pathways," with other loa appearing throughout the book. Papa Legba and Voodoo appear again in ''[[Spook Country]]'', a book from one of Gibson's other trilogies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/19/qa_with_william_gibson/ ''The Boston Globe'': Q&amp;A with William Gibson]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chapter XXII of [[James Branch Cabell]]'s ''[[Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice]]'', Jurgen and Queen Anaitis (lady of the lake) pass a statue of Legba in the courtyard. Jurgen remarks "Now certainly, Queen Anaitis, you have unusual taste in sculpture".

In the 1986 film ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]'', blues musicians [[Robert Johnson]] and Willie Brown sell their souls to a "Mr. Legba" at a Mississippi crossroads. Later in the film Legba takes the name "[[Old Scratch|Scratch]]".{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In this movie, however, Legba is mistaken for the Christian devil (or the popular notion of the devil), who takes the main character's soul in exchange for a successful musical career in blues.

There is a brief reference to Papa Legba in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[American Gods]]''.

There is a single reference to Atibon Legba in the song ''Black Cat Bone'' on the [[The Mission (band)|Mission]] album ''The Brightest Light''.

[[Erzulie]], [[Damballa]], [[Baron Samedi]] and Papa Legba, all appear in the [[Wildcats (comics)|WildCats]] original comic series, assisting [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] against [[Mait' Carrefour]].

They also appear (or are referenced to) in Terry Pratchett's book ''Witches Abroad'' (1991).{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The character Galeb from ''[[Tales of Monkey Island]]'' was based on Papa Legba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talesofmi.net/?p=820 ''The Tales of Monkey Island Blog'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Papa Legba is invoked by the Marvel Comics character [[Brother Voodoo]] for support.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In 2013 [[Lance Reddick]] portrayed Papa Legba in ''[[American Horror Story: Coven]]'', where the character is depicted wearing a top hat and black tuxedo jacket, more in keeping with one of the Barons (e.g. [[Baron Samedi]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/12/04/american-horror-story-coven-lance-reddick/ 'American Horror Story': 'Fringe' star Lance Reddick joining 'Coven' | Inside TV | EW.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This depiction is of a [[Deal with the Devil|crossroads demon]] rather than the loa of communication.

The 2014 "Danse Vaudou" episode of ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' has Papa Legba summoned by the character Papa Midnight to open a channel allowing the living to speak and attain closure with the dead.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Papa Legba is mentioned in the 2014 horror film, ''[[Jessabelle]]'', where he is called upon to open the door for a dead spirit to return to the living.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The 2014 album ''[[Memoirs of a Murderer (album)|Memoirs of a Murderer]]'' by heavy metal band [[King810]], includes an introduction for the track "Take It" with vocals by singer David Gunn: "Papa, Papa Legba, open up the gate for me."{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In the 2017 novel ''The People's Police'' by [[Norman Spinrad]], three people from New Orleans appear on TV hoping for publicity and support from the people against the banks, corporate fat cats, and corrupt politicians. Papa Legba responds by asking "What do you offer?"{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In 2017, [[Bruno Blum]] released a song named "Papa Legba&lt;ref&gt;https://brunoblum.bandcamp.com/track/papa-legba&lt;/ref&gt;" on his ''Culte'' album, in which he depicts Papa Legba as an alien, using the 'Papa Legba' voodoo drum pattern. A subsequent animation video directed by Pascal Le Gras was also issued&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1pTPfYCDBI&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the 2017 novel ''American Street'' by [http://ibizoboi.net/ Ibi Zoboi], PaPa Legba appears in Detroit, Michigan, often near the corner of American Street and Joy Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ibizoboi.net/american-street|title=AMERICAN STREET|date=2016-05-28|work=Ibi Zoboi|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Papa Legba ([[Lance Reddick]]) briefly returns in the ''[[American Horror Story: Apocalypse]]'', the eighth season of ''[[American Horror Story]]''

'''PhotoDisc, Inc.''' based in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], was a publisher of digital [[stock photography]] free of [[royalties]].

[[Image:GotlibRAB.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first tome, published by Dargaud and drawn by Gotlib]]'''''Rubrique-à-Brac''''' is a humorous [[comic strip]] series created in 1968 by [[Gotlib]]. The title is a [[portmanteau]] of the [[French language|French]] words ''rubrique'' (section) and [[bric-a-brac|''bric-à-brac'']]. Initially published in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine, the series was republished as five hardbound books between 1970 and 1974 by [[Dargaud]], and again in 2002 as one volume, which also included previously unpublished content. It is widely regarded as one of the cornerstones of today's humorous ''[[bande dessinée]]''.&lt;ref name="diplo"&gt;{{cite web| last = Garcia | first = Laure | title =Laughter in balloons | publisher = Le Nouvel Observateur | url =http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/label_france/56/gb/07.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coolfrenchcomics"&gt;{{cite web|last=CoolFrenchComics|title=Top 10|url=http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/top10.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Gotlib telescopages1985.jpg|right]] --&gt;
''Rubrique-à-Brac'' is an assortment of short (two to three pages) unrelated strips, drawn in black and white (although the 2002 re-publication was colorized). Its fairly realistic graphics contrast with the [[Surreal humour|surreal]], sometimes [[satire|satirical]] humour of its textual content. The result is comparable to a graphical form of [[deadpan]] humour. 
The backgrounds are almost non-existent, and a large portion of the panels is occupied by elaborate dialogues.

''Rubrique-à-Brac'' revisits an extremely wide range of subjects, such as historical figures, classic [[fairy tale]]s, [[folklore]], foreign countries and cultures, sport, the making of comics (in strips in which the author is often involved), movie and television [[cliché]]s, music, youth and infancy (often in strips implicitly telling the author's life), science, or the various uses of everyday items and everyday life. One of the most recurrent subjects is [[broccoli]]: this vegetable recurs as a [[running gag]] in many conversations, always unjustifiably mentioned by characters.

==Recurring characters==
* [[Isaac Newton]] often appears in otherwise unrelated strips to be hit on the head by an unlikely object (among other things a seagull, a piano, a sloth, a button... not to mention his [[Isaac Newton#Newton's apple|famous apple]]). This, of course, causes him to discover the [[law of universal gravitation]].
* The unnamed [[ladybug]] owes its existence to Gotlib's dislike of drawing backgrounds. He created this character as a way to fill up the blank space, and it is often seen in the bottom corner of panels, usually commenting on their content.
* Professeur Burp is a [[zoologist]] who occasionally presents absurd [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] expositions on various animals and animal life (giraffe, hippopotamus, stag, pig, chameleon, kangaroo,  hyena among the most outstanding and eccentric interpretations).
* Charolles, a [[caricature]] of Gotlib himself, and Bougret (a caricature of [[Gébé]]) are two criminal bureau [[detective]]s. The suspects in their various investigations are always the same two men: Blondeau Georges Jacques Babylas, a caricature of [[Goscinny]], and Aristidès Othon Frédéric Wilfrid, a caricature of French cartoonist [[Fred Aristidès|Fred]]. Although all evidence points to Aristidès, Blondeau is invariably found to be the culprit by Bougret, while Charolles is dumbfounded.
* Gotlib himself appears in a number of his own strips, whether as the artist (thus breaking the [[fourth wall]]), or as an actual character. Various other French comic artists also make appearances at one point or another.

'''Skansen''' (the [[Sconce (fortification)|Sconce]]) is the first [[open-air museum]] and [[zoo]] in Sweden and is located on the island [[Djurgården]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. It was opened on 11 October 1891 by [[Artur Hazelius]] (1833–1901) to show the way of life in the [[Provinces of Sweden|different parts of Sweden]] before the industrial era.

The name "Skansen" has also been used as a noun to refer to other open-air museums and collections of historic structures, particularly in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], but also in the [[United States]], e.g. [[Old World Wisconsin]] and [[Fairplay, Colorado]].

== History ==
[[File:Folkvisedanslaget, den första ringen, vid Skansens vårfest 1904, på sommarteatern å nedre Solliden - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0052947.jpg|thumb|Folk dance at Skansen in 1904.]]

The 19th century was a period of great change throughout [[Europe]], and Sweden was no exception. Its rural way of life was rapidly giving way to an industrialised society and many feared that the country's many traditional customs and occupations might be lost to history. Artur Hazelius, who had previously founded the [[Nordic Museum]] on the island of Djurgården near the centre of Stockholm, was inspired by the [[Norsk Folkemuseum|open-air museum]], founded by King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] in 1881, when he created his open-air museum on the hill that dominates the island. Skansen became the model for other early open-air museums in [[Scandinavia]] and later ones elsewhere.

Skansen was originally a part of the Nordic Museum, but became an independent organisation in 1963. The objects within the Skansen buildings are still the property of the Nordic Museum.

After extensive travelling, Hazelius bought around 150 houses from all over the country (as well as one structure from [[Telemark]] in [[Norway]]) and had them shipped piece by piece to the museum, where they were rebuilt to provide a unique picture of traditional Sweden. Only three of the buildings in the museum are not original, and were painstakingly copied from examples he had found. All of the buildings are open to visitors and show the full range of Swedish life from the Skogaholm Manor house built in 1680, to the 16th century Älvros farmhouses.

== The open-air museum ==
Skansen attracts more than 1.3 million visitors each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skansen.se |title=Skansen |publisher=Official site |accessdate=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many exhibits over the 75 [[acre]] (300,000 m²) site include a full replica of an average 19th-century town, in which craftsmen in traditional dress such as tanners, shoemakers, silversmiths, bakers and glass-blowers demonstrate their skills in period surroundings. There is even a small patch growing [[tobacco]] used for the making of [[cigarette]]s. There is also an open-air [[zoo]] containing a wide range of [[Scandinavia]]n animals including the [[wisent|bison]], [[brown bear]], [[moose]], [[grey seal]], [[lynx]], [[otter]], [[red fox]], [[reindeer]], [[gray wolf|wolf]], and [[wolverine]] (as well as some non-Scandinavian animals because of their popularity). There are also farmsteads where rare breeds of [[farm animals]] can be seen.

In early December the site's central Bollnäs square is host to a popular Christmas market that has been held since 1903, attracting around 25,000 visitors each weekend. In the summer there are displays of [[folk dancing]] and concerts.

== Funicular railway ==
Since 1897, Skansen has been served by the [[Skansens Bergbana]], a [[funicular|funicular railway]] on the northwest side of the Skansen hill. The funicular is 196.4 meters long, with a total rise of 34.57 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funiculars.net/articles.php?art=skansen_se |title=Skansens Bergbana |publisher=Funiculars.net|accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Foreign Exchange}}
The '''''Smithsonian Agreement''''', announced in December 1971, created a new dollar standard, whereby the currencies of a number of industrialized nations were pegged to the [[United States dollar|US dollar]]. These currencies were allowed to fluctuate by 2.25% against the dollar. The Smithsonian Agreement was created by the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]] (G-10) nations (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) raised the price of [[gold]] to 38 dollars, a 8.5% increase over the previous price at which was the US government had promised to redeem dollars for gold. In effect, the changing gold price devalued the dollar by 7.9%.

== Background ==
The [[Bretton Woods Conference]] of 1944 established an international [[fixed exchange rate]] system based on the [[Gold standard|gold exchange standard]], in which currencies were pegged to the [[United States dollar]], itself convertible into gold at $35/ounce.

A negative [[balance of payments]], growing [[public debt]] incurred by the [[Vietnam War]] and [[Great Society]] programs, and [[monetary inflation]] by the Federal Reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard (2000), op. cit., Ch. 9, pp. 172–173, and Ch. 23, pp. 447–450.&lt;/ref&gt; The drain on US gold reserves culminated with the [[London Gold Pool]] collapse in March 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcmod19680314.pdf|publisher=[[Federal Reserve]]|title=Memorandum of discussion, Federal Open Market Committee|date=1968-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] unilaterally [[Nixon shock|suspended]] the [[convertibility]] of US dollars into gold. The United States had deliberately offered this convertibility in 1944; it was put into practice by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]. The suspension made the dollar effectively a [[fiat currency]].

Nixon's administration subsequently entered negotiations with industrialized allies to reassess exchange rates following this development.

Meeting in December 1971 at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington D.C.]], the [[Group of Ten (economic)|Group of Ten]] signed the Smithsonian Agreement. The US pledged to peg the dollar at $38/ounce (instead of $35/ounce; in other words: the USD rate lost 7.9 %) with 2.25% trading bands, and other countries agreed to [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciate]] their currencies versus the dollar: Yen +16.9 %; [[Deutsche Mark]] +13.6 %, [[French Franc]] +8.6 %, [[British pound]] the same, [[Italian lira]] +7.5 %.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otmar Emminger]]: ''DM, Dollar, Währungskrisen – Erinnerungen eines ehemaligen Bundesbankpräsidenten'', 1986, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; The group also planned to balance the world financial system using [[special drawing rights]] alone.

== Development ==
Although the Smithsonian Agreement was hailed by President Nixon as a fundamental reorganization of international monetary affairs, it failed to encourage discipline by the Federal Reserve or the United States government.  The dollar price in the gold [[free market]] continued to cause pressure on its official rate; soon after a 10% devaluation was announced on 14 February 1973, [[Japan]] and the [[Organization for European Economic Cooperation |OEEC]] countries decided to let their currencies float. A decade later, all industrialized nations had done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mastanduno | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1017/S0043887109000057 | title = System Maker and Privilege Taker | journal = World Politics | volume = 61 | pages = 121 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eichengreen |first1=Barry |title=Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System |year=2011 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199753789 |page= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Exchange Rate Regime of Asian Countries |work=International Economics |first1=Prof. Wong Ka |last1=Fu |publisher=The [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], Department of Economics|url=http://intl.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/exchange_rate_regime/index.php?cid=9|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer networking]], '''split-horizon DNS''', '''split-view DNS''', '''split-brain DNS''', or '''split DNS''' is the facility of a [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) implementation to provide different sets of DNS information, usually selected by the source address of the DNS request.

This facility can provide a mechanism for security and privacy management by logical or physical separation of DNS information for network-internal access (within an [[administrative domain]], e.g., company) and access from an unsecure, public network (e.g. the [[Internet]]).

Implementation of split-horizon DNS can be accomplished with hardware-based separation or by software solutions.  Hardware-based implementations run distinct DNS server devices for the desired access granularity within the networks involved. Software solutions use either multiple DNS server processes on the same hardware or special server software with the built-in capability of discriminating access to [[DNS zone]] records. The latter is a common feature of many server software implementations of the DNS protocol (cf. [[Comparison of DNS server software]]) and is sometimes the implied meaning of the term ''split-horizon DNS'', since all other forms of implementation can be achieved with any DNS server software.

==Split-Horizon DNS and DNSSEC==
Split-horizon DNS is designed to provide different authoritative answers to an identical query and [[DNSSEC]] is used to ensure veracity of data returned by the Domain Name System.  These apparently conflicting goals create the potential for confusion or false security alerts in poorly constructed networks. Research has produced recommendations to properly combine these two DNS features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-krishnaswamy-dnsop-dnssec-split-view Split-View DNSSEC Operational Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use Case==
One common use case for split-horizon DNS is when a server, ''host1'' in the example below, has both a private IP address on a local area network (not reachable from most of the Internet) and a public address, i.e. an address reachable across the Internet in general. By using split-horizon DNS the same name can lead to either the private IP address or the public one, depending on which client sends the query. This allows for critical local client machines to access a server directly through the local network, without the need to pass through a router. Passing through fewer network devices improves the network latency.

Internal DNS view, the server is named host1.example.net:

'''Susan Bassnett''' (born 1945) is a [[translation theorist]] and scholar of [[comparative literature]]. She served as pro-vice-chancellor at the [[University of Warwick]] for ten years and taught in its Centre for Translation and Comparative Cultural Studies, which closed in 2009. As of 2016, she is a professor of comparative literature at the [[University of Glasgow|Universities of Glasgow]] and Warwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Panda|first=Aditya Kumar|url=https://www.academia.edu/33497817/An_Interview_with_Susan_Bassnett|title=An Interview with Susan Bassnett|work=Translation Today|volume=10|issue=II|year=2016|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educated around Europe, she began her career in Italy and has lectured at universities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/modernlanguages/people/academic/sbassnett Susan Bassnett faculty page at the University of Warwick]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she was elected a Fellow at the [[Royal Society of Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rslit.org/content/fellows/B Bassnett at RSL] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927083522/http://www.rslit.org/content/fellows/B |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==
Among her more than twenty books, several have become mainstays in the field of literary criticism, especially ''Translation Studies'' (1980) and ''Comparative Literature'' (1993). A book on [[Ted Hughes]] was published in 2009. Another book edited by Bassnett is ''Knives and Angels: Women Writers in Latin America''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GwujbDcmcvMC Knives and  Angels: Women Writers in Latin America. Ed. Susan Bassnett. London: Zed Books, 1990.]&lt;/ref&gt; Bassnett's collaboration with several intellectuals in a series of book projects has been received well. In 2006, she co-edited with [[Peter Bush (translator)|Peter Bush]] the book ''The Translator as Writer''. In addition to her scholarly works, Bassnett writes poetry which was published as ''Exchanging Lives: Poems and Translations'' (2002).

== Critical ideas ==

===Foregrounding translation===
In her 1998 work ''Constructing Cultures: Essays on Literary Translation'' (written with [[André Lefevere]]), Bassnett states that "the shift of emphasis from original to translation is reflected in discussions on the visibility of the translator. [[Lawrence Venuti]] calls for a translator-centered translation, insisting that the translator should inscribe him/herself visibly into the text".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.uy/books?id=9v_uEf9k280C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=%22susan+bassnett%22+venuti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fLPdmP8Wvp&amp;sig=v1whCmbRcb6VDzOw_pIboy_QNXU&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=DUTsTLmVBIm4sAP1tPm1Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22susan%20bassnett%22%20venuti&amp;f=false ''Constructing Cultures: Essays on Literary Translation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative literature as a literary strategy===
In a 2006 essay titled ''Reflections on Comparative Literature in the Twenty-First Century'', she engaged with [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] who argues in ''Death of a Discipline'' (2003) that the field of comparative literature must move beyond its eurocentrism if it is to stay relevant. While she agrees with Spivak that eurocentrism has marginalised literatures from the non-West, she also argues that Spivak's argument puts comparatists from Europe, who are familiar with its literatures, in a precarious position. To Bassnett, the way out for European comparatists is to critically investigate their past. Bassnett also recanted her previous stance that comparative literature is a dying subject that will slowly be replaced by translation studies. Rather, she argues that comparative literature and translation theory continue to be relevant today if taken as modes of reading that literary critics can use to approach texts.

==Personal life==
Clive Barker, Bassnett's long-term partner and a theatre studies academic at Warwick, died in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Baz Kershaw [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/19/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries Obituary: Clive Barker], ''The Guardian'', 19 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Frank Morrison Pixley.jpg|thumb|Frank M. Pixley, founder &amp; editor of ''The Argonaut'']]

'''''The Argonaut''''' was a [[literary journal]] based in [[San Francisco, California]], that ran from 1877 to 1956, founded and published originally by [[Frank M. Pixley]]. The name comes from the local term for gold prospectors, argonaut.&lt;ref&gt;Ar"go*naut\, n. One of those who went to California in search of gold shortly after it was discovered there in 1848. [U. S.] --Bret Harte. The "Argonauts of '49" were a strong, self-reliant, generous body of men. --D. S. Jordan.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was known for containing strong political Americanism combined with art and literature. Many 19th-century writers such as [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Yda Addis]], and [[Gertrude Atherton]] appeared regularly in its pages. It was considered one of the most important publications in California, and it had a great deal of political influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.argonaut360.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/96644495/|title=The Argonaut.|publisher=|via=chroniclingamerica.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a staunch Republican, Pixley used ''The Argonaut'' to support [[Leland Stanford]] and other owners of the Central Pacific Railroad. Pixley, who served as ''The Argonaut's'' editor and publisher, had been California's 8th attorney general when Stanford was governor. The journal was founded as a counterweight to Denis Kearney, an Irish-born labor leader who represented many of the Irish immigrants who worked for the railroad. Pixley, who wanted someday to become governor of California himself, was said to have handed out gold coins to sway voters.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, Daniel. (1999) ''Ambrose Bierce Takes On the Railroad: The Journalist as Muckraker and Cynic.'' Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerome Hart]] became the magazine's editor in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist2/kalloch.html|title=The Kearney-Kalloch Epoch|website=www.sfmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern rebirth==
The magazine was revived in 1991, by [[Warren Hinckle]], and continues in both print and online formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argonaut360.com/|title=Argonaut360.com|website=www.argonaut360.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Big Book Of''''' is a series of [[graphic novel]] [[comics anthology|anthologies]] published by American company [[DC Comics]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[Paradox Press]].

==Publication history==
The ''Big Books'' were published between 1994 and 2000. Just over half of them (ten out of seventeen) were written by a single author (including [[Doug Moench]] and [[John Wagner]]), with [[Jonathan Vankin]] taking over the writing of the later volumes.

A wide range of artists worked on the stories. Notably it was the first American work for [[Frank Quitely]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Khoury (author)|Khoury, George]]. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=15874&amp;page=article MEET FRANK QUITELY], ''Pop!'', [[Comic Book Resources]], April 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rick Geary]] reckons he is the only artist to contribute to all seventeen volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, Terry. [http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/115479220239661.htm "Rick Geary&amp;nbsp;— The Man Who Draws Gumby!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807160431/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/115479220239661.htm |date=2008-08-07 }}, [[Comics Bulletin]] (Aug. 5, 2006). Accessed Oct. 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  E.C. alums [[Joe Orlando]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]] and [[Marie Severin]] are present as are [[Russ Heath]] and [[Gray Morrow]]. The Big Books were the last stands of masters of horror [[Tom Sutton]] and [[Pat Boyette]]. Other artists who were regular contributors to the series as a whole include [[Bob Fingerman]], [[Eric Shanower]], [[Lennie Mace]], [[Randy DuBurke]], [[James Romberger]], [[Salgood Sam]], [[Steve Leialoha]], [[Joe Sacco]], [[Roger Langridge]], and [[Alec Stevens]].

===Wild Women===
Slated for a 2001 release, Paradox had planned to publish the 18th book in the series, ''The Big Book of Wild Women''. The book is narrated by "Susie the Floozie," and was to profile notable women throughout history who had made an impact on American culture while pushing the envelope of unconventional behavior. Among the women to be profiled were risqué [[nightclub singer]]-comic [[Rusty Warren]], [[B-movie]] goddess [[Tura Satana]], presidential candidate [[Victoria Woodhull]], 19th century sex star [[Lola Montez|Lola Montes]], legendary seductress [[Cleopatra]], scandalous writer [[Anaïs Nin]], and kinky pin-up icon [[Bettie Page]]. According to DC, however, the book is in a perpetual "pre-production"&amp;nbsp;— even though much of the work on the book was completed by the contributing artists.&lt;ref name="comicsjournal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rev. Susie the Floozie|url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=246&amp;Itemid=48|accessdate=2007-02-27|author=Fleener, Mary|publisher=''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 1997 and written by [[Paul Kirchner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id=23006|title=''The Big Book of Losers''}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Big Book of Losers'' proves that the misfortunes of others (such as [[Elisha Gray]], who invented a telephone prototype before [[Alexander Graham Bell]]) really can be funny.

The thirteenth ''Big Book'' examines evil, like [[Heinrich Himmler]], the architect of the Nazis' "Final Solution;" the depraved emperors of ancient Rome; and various [[serial killer]]s. Then there are proponents of the banal, like poet [[Rod McKuen]] and real estate developer [[William Levitt]]. Finally, there are fictional villains like [[Professor Moriarty]], [[Lady Macbeth]], and [[Dracula]].

===The Weird Wild West===
Published in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id=23012|title=''The Big Book of the Weird Wild West''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and written by [[John Whalen]], the ''Big Book of the Weird Wild West'' offers up over sixty stories of the unusual, the bizarre, and the downright creepy stuff that happened on the American frontier.

'''''The Player''''' is a 1992 American [[Satire|satirical]] [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Robert Altman]] and written by [[Michael Tolkin]], based on his own 1988 novel of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkin, Michael, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSCdACRt0qkC&amp;printsec=frontcover "The Player"], 1st ed., New York : Atlantic Monthly Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-87113-228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Tim Robbins]], [[Greta Scacchi]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Peter Gallagher]], [[Brion James]], [[Cynthia Stevenson]] and is the story of a [[Hollywood]] [[film studio]] executive who murders an aspiring screenwriter he believes is sending him death threats.

''The Player'' has many film references and Hollywood in-jokes, with 65 celebrities making [[cameo appearance]]s in the film. Altman once stated that the film "is a very mild satire," offending no one.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;DVD commentary on ''The Player''.&lt;/ref&gt; The film received three nominations at the [[65th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]]. The film also won two [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor – Comedy or Musical]] for Robbins.

==Plot==
Griffin Mill ([[Tim Robbins]]) is a [[Hollywood]] studio executive dating story editor Bonnie Sherow ([[Cynthia Stevenson]]). He hears story pitches from [[screenwriter]]s and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy ([[Peter Gallagher]]) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.

Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir ([[Greta Scacchi]]) that Kahane is at a theater in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery.

The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel ([[Fred Ward]]) confronts him about the murder and says that the police know that he was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) and DeLongpre ([[Lyle Lovett]]) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the writer suggesting that they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley ([[Richard E. Grant]]) and Andy Sivella ([[Dean Stockwell]]), who pitch ''Habeas Corpus'', a legal drama featuring no major stars and with a depressing ending. Because Mill is not alone, his stalker does not appear. After leaving the club, Mill receives a fax in his car, advising him to look under his raincoat. He discovers a live rattlesnake in a box and, terrified, bludgeons it with his umbrella.

Mill tells June that his near-death experience made him realize he has feelings for her. Apprehensive that Larry Levy continues encroaching on his job, Mill invites the two writers to pitch ''Habeas Corpus'' to him, convincing Levy that the movie will be an [[Oscar bait|Oscar contender]]. Mill's plan is to let Levy shepherd the film through production and have it flop. Mill will step in at the last moment, suggesting some changes to salvage the film's box office, letting him reclaim his position at the studio. Having persuaded Bonnie to leave for New York on studio business, Mill takes June to a Hollywood awards banquet and their relationship blossoms.

After Bonnie confronts Mill about his relationship with June, Mill coldly severs their relationship in front of two writers. Mill takes June to an isolated [[Desert Hot Springs, California|Desert Hot Springs]] resort and spa. In the middle of Mill and June making love, Mill confesses his role in Kahane's murder, and June responds by saying she loves him. Mill's attorney ([[Sydney Pollack]]) informs him that studio head Joel Levison ([[Brion James]]) has been fired, and that the Pasadena police want Mill to participate in a [[police lineup|lineup]]. An eyewitness has come forward, but she fails to identify Mill.

One year later, studio power players are watching the end of ''Habeas Corpus'' with a new, tacked-on, upbeat Hollywood ending and famous actors in the lead roles. Mill's plan to save the movie has worked and he is head of the studio. June is now Mill's wife and pregnant with his child. Bonnie objects to the film's new ending and is fired by Levy. Mill rebuffs her when she appeals her termination to him. Mill receives a pitch over the phone from Levy and a man who reveals himself as the postcard writer. The man pitches an idea about a studio executive who kills a writer and gets away with murder. Mill gives the writer a deal, if he can guarantee the executive a happy ending. The writer's title for the film is ''The Player''.

==Production==
Altman had troubles with the Hollywood studio system in the 1970s after a number of studio films (''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'', ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'') lost money or had trouble finding audiences despite the critical praise and cult adulation they received. Altman continued to work outside the studios in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, often doing small budget projects or filmed plays to keep his career alive. Although it was distributed by [[Fine Line Features]] rather than a major studio (FLF was a division of [[New Line Cinema]]), ''The Player'' was a comeback to making films in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Noel |title=Vincent &amp; Theo |date=March 30, 2015 |work=[[The Dissolve]] |url=http://thedissolve.com/reviews/1475-vincent-theo/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407084439/http://thedissolve.com/reviews/1475-vincent-theo/ |archivedate=2016-04-07 |dead-url=no |quote=When ''The Player'' came out in 1992, it was greeted as a welcome comeback for director Robert Altman, who spent much of the previous decade working small—making filmed plays instead of the ambitious, character-heavy genre reinventions he’d been known for in the 1970s. But Altman actually reclaimed his critics’ darling status two years earlier with ''Vincent &amp; Theo'', a luminous biopic about painter Vincent Van Gogh (played by Tim Roth) and his art-dealer brother (Paul Rhys).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ushered in a new period of filmmaking for Altman, who continued on to an adaptation of [[Raymond Carver]]'s short stories, ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993).

===Opening sequence shot===
The opening [[Long take|sequence shot]] lasts 7 minutes and 47 seconds without an edit. Fifteen takes were required to shoot this scene,&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/164409-the-pragmatic-anarchy-of-the-long-take/|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2012-11-09|title=The Pragmatic Anarchy of the Long Take|author=J.C. Maçek III}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to the slate at the beginning of the shot, the tenth take was used in the final edit.

===Intimate scene===
Altman was praised for the sex scene in which Robbins and Scacchi were filmed from the neck up. Scacchi later claimed that Altman had wanted a [[nude scene]], but that it was her refusal which led to the final form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greta Scacchi: 'I'm done with taking off my clothes on screen'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3557111/Greta-Scacchi-Im-done-with-taking-off-my-clothes-on-screen.html|accessdate=14 October 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editing===
The editing of ''The Player'' by Geraldine Peroni was honored by a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing]]. In 2004, [[Anthony Sloman|Tony Sloman]] wrote an appreciation of the film's editing:&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sloman |first=Tony |title=Geraldine Peroni Obituary: Oscar-nominated film editor on 'The Player' |work=[[The Independent]] |date=August 31, 2004 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/geraldine-peroni-550379.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5aQLxEi3O?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/geraldine-peroni-550379.html# |archivedate=August 29, 2008 |access-date=September 16, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|''The Player'' is a marvellous example of collaborative editing, Peroni matching Altman's tone with exactitude. Early on, a cut from a zoom-in to the gun in Humphrey Bogart's hand on a postcard sent to Tim Robbins is perfectly successively matched with what appears to be a black frame, in which a reveal shows that it's an open drawer in which the postcard has been placed. Another felicitous sequence is the one in the Pasadena police station, where the Robbins character is arraigned as Lyle Lovett swats a fly and Whoopi Goldberg and her associates ridicule Robbins with laughter. This is beautifully edited; well-shot, too, but the rhythm is built in the cutting.}}

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Bitingly cynical without succumbing to bitterness, ''The Player'' is one of the all-time great Hollywood satires -- and an ensemble-driven highlight of the Altman oeuvre."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten tomatoes|player}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 86 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating "universal acclaim."&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|id=the-player}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altman won a number of European best-director awards (the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]], [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]])&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/15/year/1992.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Player |accessdate=2009-08-15|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Director (the film won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical]]). Tolkin was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]], and he received an [[Edgar Award]] for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. [[Geraldine Peroni]]'s editing was nominated for both the [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Academy Award]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|BAFTA Award]]. Tim Robbins also won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor – Comedy or Musical]] and [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com" /&gt;

In 2015, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s 25th anniversary year, it named ''The Player'' in its list of the 25 best movies since the magazine's beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EW's 25 Best Movies in 25 Years|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/25-best-movies-25-years/2330836_player-1992|website=ew.com|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Redwall Cookbook''''' is a [[cookbook]] based on food from the [[Redwall]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/redwall-cookbook-brian-jacques/1102486967#/|title=The Redwall Cookbook|last=Noble|first=Barnes &amp;|website=Barnes &amp; Noble|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contains recipes mentioned in the books, from Deeper'n'Ever Pie and Summer Strawberry Fizz to Abbey Trifle and Great Hall Gooseberry Fool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7989.The_Redwall_Cookbook|title=The Redwall Cookbook|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
This book features numerous recipes for dishes mentioned in the [[Redwall]] series, and features illustrations by [[Christopher Denise]].  The plot follows Sister Pansy through one cycle of the seasons in Redwall Abbey, as she becomes the Head Cook.

The cookbook is divided into the four seasons:  Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.  As befits the cooking of gentle woodland creatures, all of the recipes (with the exception of the obvious crustacean ingredient in Shrimp'n'Hotroot Soup) are completely vegetarian. Each recipe is preceded by a description of who is making the dish and how it is being prepared. There are also short warnings and anecdotes by the characters sprinkled throughout the text.

'''''This Is Not a Movie''''' is a 2010 Mexican experimental [[science fiction film]] written and directed by [[Olallo Rubio]].  It stars [[Edward Furlong]] in three roles, playing different personalities of the same character, who prepares for the end of the world by sequestering himself in a [[Las Vegas]] hotel while he grapples with existential questions.  The score was composed by musician [[Slash (musician)|Slash]].  It premiered at the [[Morelia International Film Festival]] in 2010 and was released in Mexico on January 28, 2011.

== Plot ==
Concerned that he cannot remember his past, Pete Nelson prepares for the end of the world by going to Las Vegas.  In his hotel room, three distinct personalities emerge and argue with each other over the nature of reality and how to best spend the remaining time.  The first personality, a bitter man who blames his failed life on "the system", wants to explore his forgotten past.  The second personality, a drunken hedonist, wants to leave the hotel and take advantage of the prostitution and gambling in Las Vegas.  A third personality, which emerges after debates between the first two, questions the nature of reality and states that they are all fictional characters in the screenplay of a [[hack writer]].

Eventually, a ghost appears, whom Pete identifies as Jimmy, a friend who died years ago.  Jimmy points out plot holes in the film, including the fact that he can perceive each of the three personalities.  With this evidence, Pete's personalities become more convinced that they are in a film, though they also debate the idea that he whole situation is a dream, which the third personality decries as further evidence that the writer is a hack.  Nelson experiences a series of hallucinations or dreams in the form of parodic short films and trailers laced with conspiracy theories.  One lampoons the Apple "[[think different]]" ad campaign and states that anyone who actually thinks differently is assassinated.  Another posits a cabal of world leaders and businessmen who control the world through a company called Propaganda. Films like ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|Empire Strikes Back]]'', ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', ''[[The Delta Force]]'', ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'', and ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'' are spoofed, mentioned or referenced. There is a scene where Pete confronts the audience (and himself) by [[Fourth wall#Breaking the fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and threatening to kill the camera.

The first personality tires of the other two personalities and shoots both.  Jimmy's ghost then shoots him, but Pete does not die.  Instead, the CEO of Propaganda reappears as a disembodied voice and guides Pete to place where they can talk face-to-face.  There, the man reveals himself as a former CIA agent and the screenwriter who created Pete.  Depressed about his lack of success in finishing the screenplay, the writer explains that he has become suicidal and threatens to kill himself, which was the source of the apocalypse in Pete's world.  The writer berates Pete for derailing the writing process and taking over the character.  Pete is unable to talk the writer out his course of action, and the film ends as the writer shoots himself in the head.

== Reception ==
Howard Feinstein of ''[[Screen Daily]]'' wrote that the themes are "all wrong for a film" and "go nowhere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/latest-reviews/this-is-not-a-movie/5019732.article|title=This Is Not A Movie|last=Feinstein|first=Howard|work=[[Screen Daily]]|date=2010-10-23|accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harry H. Long of the ''[[Lebanon Daily News]]'' said the film's themes are unclear and scattershot, but the film is "masterfully done" and features a "tour-de-force performance" from Furlong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ldnews.com/ci_20390988/this-is-not-movie-you-decide|title=This is not a movie?

== History ==
TripAdvisor was founded by Stephen Kaufer, Langley Steinert, Nick Shanny, and Thomas Palka in February 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morris |first1=Cheryl |title=Boston Tech-Mafia Mondays: TripAdvisor – Pioneers in Online Travel |url=https://www.americaninno.com/boston/boston-tech-mafia-mondays-tripadvisor-pioneers-in-online-travel/ |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=BostInno |date=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaufer has stated that the original idea wasn't a user generated social media site to swap reviews, "We started as a site where we were focused more on those official words from guidebooks or newspapers or magazines. We also had a button in the very beginning that said, "Visitors add your own review", and boy, did that just take off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04l3cmq|title=Interview with Stephen Kaufer|last=|first=|date=October 16, 2014|work=BBC Radio 4: The Bottom Line|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original financing was obtained from Flagship Ventures, the Bollard Group, and private investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flagshipventures.com/about/news/iac-acquires-tripadvisor-inc |title=IAC Acquires TripAdvisor, Inc |publisher=Flagship Ventures |date=2004-03-16 |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105020/http://www.flagshipventures.com/about/news/iac-acquires-tripadvisor-inc |archivedate=2011-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the company was purchased by [[IAC/InterActiveCorp]].&lt;ref name="skift"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://skift.com/history-of-online-travel/|title=The Definitive oral  history of online travel|last=Schaal|first=Dennis|year=2016|publisher=[[Skift]]|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, IAC spun off its travel group of businesses under the [[Expedia, Inc.]] name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.expediainc.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=22 |title=IAC Completes Spin-Off of Expedia, Inc |publisher=[[Expedia, Inc.]] |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415221751/http://press.expediainc.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=22 |archivedate=2010-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, TripAdvisor launched its official site in China, since then it has indexed more than 20,000 hotels and restaurants information and customer reviews, and made top lists, becoming one of the biggest travel websites as of July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daodao.com/pages/about_us.html |title=about daodao.com |publisher=daodao.com |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2011-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121055623/http://www.daodao.com/pages/about_us.html |archive-date=2011-11-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, SmarterTravel, part of TripAdvisor Media Group, launched SniqueAway (now Jetsetter), the first members-only site where each travel deal is endorsed by the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Places to go in Milan| url=http://milan.citylisting.org/| accessdate=13 March 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102008/http://milan.citylisting.org/| archivedate=2 April 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, TripAdvisor informed all registered TripAdvisor members that an unauthorized third party had stolen some of TripAdvisor's email list and might use it to create spam messages. No passwords or other information was stolen. This happened shortly before many other companies reported similar thefts of the addresses on their email lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/03/24/tripadvisor-hacked-member-emails-stolen/ |title=TripAdvisor hacked, member emails stolen |publisher=Financial Post|date=2011-03-24 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, it was announced that Expedia would split into two publicly traded companies by spinning off the TripAdvisor brand of travel sites. According to Expedia CEO [[Dara Khosrowshahi]], the move "allows the two businesses to be pure plays and to operate with the proper amount of focus to grow respectively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/uk-expedia-idUSLNE73700O20110408 |title=Expedia plans to split into two companies |publisher=Reuters|date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a July 2011 PhoCusWright survey of 3,641 respondents, solicited at random through a pop-up invitation link on TripAdvisor.com and commissioned by Trip Advisor, “98% of participants found that TripAdvisor’s hotel reviews … accurately reflect the experience.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, TripAdvisor was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Expedia in a public offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/22/weak-wall-street-welcome-for-newton-based-tripadvisor/8hzGHDB5yWPmsge8fp6StI/story.html |title=A weak Wall Street welcome for Newton-based TripAdvisor - Business |work= The Boston Globe|date=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TripAdvisor becomes the world’s largest travel site, with nearly 280 million unique monthly visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traveltradejournal.com/newsdetails.php?nid=353 |title=TripAdvisor is now the world's largest social travel website |publisher=Traveltradejournal.com |date=2012-03-17 |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120065922/http://www.traveltradejournal.com/newsdetails.php?nid=353 |archivedate=2013-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the company launched a connection to [[Facebook]] that lets users select reviews from people in their social graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnooz.com/2012/04/11/news/tripadvisor-unveils-next-phase-of-facebook-tie-in-friends-of-friends-included-in-reviews/ |title=TripAdvisor unveils next phase of Facebook tie-in, friends of friends included in reviews |publisher=Tnooz |date=2012-04-11 |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Trip Advisor released a new feature, "Just for you", offering tailored hotel recommendations based on the user's preferences and search history on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sawers, Paul |date=October 27, 2014|work= TheNextWeb|title=TripAdvisor introduces 'Just for You,’ hotel recommendations based on search history and feedback]|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/10/28/tripadvisor-introduces-just-hotel-recommendations-based-search-history-feedback/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This feature mirrored the "Tribes" feature launched on competitor site [[Gogobot]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tnooz.com/article/gogobot-goes-niche-offering-users-contextual-search-aligned-specific-interests/|title=Gogobot goes niche, offering users contextual search aligned to specific interests called Tribes|newspaper=Tnooz|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revenue model==
As per its annual shareholder report, Trip advisor earns 43% of its revenues through its two most significant advertising partners, [[Expedia]] and [[Priceline.com|Priceline]] (and their subsidiaries).
It derives a substantial portion of its revenue from advertising and redirections. These include revenues from the sale of advertising, mostly through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based and subscription-based advertising. The company also has master advertising contracts with its advertising partners.&lt;ref name="sr2017" /&gt;
 
Its advertisers usually depend on this advertising to generate sales leads, customers, bookings, or revenue and profit on a cost-effective basis. Click-based advertising revenue accounts for the majority of its advertising revenue. Its CPC pricing for click-based advertising depends, in part, on competition between advertisers. Its advertisers currently focus more on traffic volume rather than per-click profit. Hence they do not reduce the CPC. As of 2017, Trip advisor employed 3,217 part time and full time employees, of whom 51% were located in USA.&lt;ref name="sr2017" /&gt;

==Acquisitions==
In May 2007, TripAdvisor acquired Smarter Travel Media operator of SmarterTravel.com and BookingBuddy.com; [[SeatGuru]].com; [[TravelPod]].com; and Travel-Library.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelmarketing.com/index.php/article/070509_tripadvisor_acquires_five_travel_communitites/ |title=TripAdvisor acquires five travel communities |publisher=HotelMarketing.com|date=2007-05-09 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in May 2007, TripAdvisor acquired The Independent Traveler, Inc., publisher of [[Cruise Critic]].com and IndependentTraveler.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-163789809.html |title=TripAdvisor Acquires Cruise Critic, Leading Cruise Community |publisher=PR Wire|date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and fraudulent reviews ==
TripAdvisor has been the subject of controversy for allowing unsubstantiated anonymous reviews to be posted about any hotel, [[Bed and breakfast|B&amp;B]], inn, or restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dodson, Sean |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jul/21/saturday.travelwebsites |title=Best of the net: Tripadvisor - the great divide |publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-07-21 |accessdate=2008-09-22 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 30 hotels have been blacklisted{{vague|date=October 2017}} by TripAdvisor for suspicious reviews, including a [[Cornwall]] hotel that bribed guests to leave positive reviews of the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/cornwall-hotel-bribes-guests-to-write-140593 |title=Cornwall hotel bribes guests to write good reviews on TripAdvisor.com |work=Mirror Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TripAdvisor has stated that reviews are not posted to the website instantly, but are subject to a verification process which considers the [[IP address]] and email address of the author, and tries to detect any suspicious patterns or obscene or abusive language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/10/11/2011/341016/caterer-and-hotelkeeper-interview-christine-petersen-tripadvisor.htm |title=Caterer and Hotelkeeper interview - TripAdvisor|author=Petersen, Christine |work= Caterersearch.com|date= November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also allows the community of users to report suspicious content, which is then assessed by Tripadvisor staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/tripadvisor-removes-its-reviews-you-trust-slogan-2353669.html | title = TripAdvisor removes its 'reviews you can trust' slogan | website = [[The Independent]] | last = Hall | first = Richard | date = September 12, 2011 | accessdate = July 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) launched a formal investigation into TripAdvisor after receiving a complaint submitted by online investigations company KwikChex that its claims to provide trustworthy and honest reviews from travelers are false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/02/tripadvisor-asa-investigation-reviews |title=ASA to Investigate TripAdvisor |publisher=Guardian.co.uk | date=2011-09-02 |location=London |first=Mark |last=Sweney}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ASA found that TripAdvisor "should not claim or imply that all its reviews were from real travellers, or were honest, real or trusted",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16823012 | work=BBC News | title=TripAdvisor rebuked over 'trust' claims on review site | date=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result of the investigation, TripAdvisor was ordered to remove the slogan "reviews you can trust" from its UK web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16823012 | title=Trip Advisor rebuked over 'trust' claims by ASA | publisher=BBC and ASA |date=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It changed its hotel review section slogan to 'reviews from our community.'

TripAdvisor stated that the branding change had been planned for some time and that changes began in June 2011, before the ASA investigation.&lt;ref name="slogan removed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2036846/TripAdvisor-removes-reviews-trust-slogan-website.html |title=TripAdvisor removes 'reviews you can trust' slogan from its website |publisher=Daily Mail.co.uk | date=2011-09-13 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASA commented that "it was concerned that consumers might be fooled by fraudulent posts since the entries could be made without any form of verification," but recognised that TripAdvisor used "advanced and highly effective fraud systems" in an attempt to identify and remove fake content.

In 2012, an action was brought in a [[Sheriff Court]] in Scotland, by a guesthouse owner who claimed damages for malicious statements.  TripAdvisor asserted that the Scottish courts lacked jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/highlands-islands/113661-guesthouse-owner-sues-travel-website-tripadvisor-over-negative-review/|title=Guesthouse owner sues travel website Tripadvisor over negative review|website=STV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this case was called a "landmark victory", as the pursuer (plaintiff) secured two points of law in the UK:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2216502/Tiny-B-amp-B-deals-blow-Tripadvisor-wins-landmark-victory-visitors-posted-bad-reviews.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Tiny B&amp;B deals blow for TripAdvisor as it wins landmark victory after visitors posted bad reviews | date=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*TripAdvisor conceded that it could be sued in the UK's jurisdictions (having previously claimed to be outside the remit of the [[Scots law|Scottish legal system]] because it is based in Massachusetts); 
*TripAdvisor's terms of use constituted a contract, which was actionable/enforceable by the business being reviewed.    
The case was found to involve issues relating to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Act, 1977: these issues were referred to a higher court in [[Stornoway]].

In 2012, TripAdvisor was fined $80,000 by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] for violating new fair trading regulations requiring taxes and fees to be shown for prices quoted for airfares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/13/business/la-fi-mo-tripadvisor-fined-20120713 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Hugo | last=Martin | title=TripAdvisor fined for violating airfare advertising rule | date=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, a fake restaurant was set up by a disgruntled businessman and reportedly had diners looking for the eatery in an alley filled with garbage cans. The fake listing went undetected on TripAdvisor for over 2 months until it was exposed by KwikChex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2013/07/29/fake-restaurant-on-tripadvisor-sends-diners-to-alley-filled-with-garbage-cans.html#ixzz2aXnTLPFv|title=Fake restaurant on TripAdvisor sends diners to alley filled with garbage cans|date=2013-07-29|newspaper=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, TripAdvisor's Chinese site came under scrutiny because KwikChex uncovered that a reviewer had reviewed 51 Parisian restaurants in one month, while also reviewing 50 Hotels in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Attwool|first1=Jolyon|title=TripAdvisor’s China website comes under fire|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/10698798/TripAdvisors-China-website-comes-under-fire.html|accessdate=13 January 2015|date=14 March 2014|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the Italian Antitrust Authority fined TripAdvisor €500,000 for improper commercial practices on the TripAdvisor website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30583483|title=Tripadvisor fined by Italian competition regulator|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agcm.it/stampa/comunicati/7365-ps9345-mezzo-milione-di-multa-a-tripadvisor.html|title=PS9345 - Mezzo milione di multa a Tripadvisor|author=Francesca Melchiorri|website=agcm.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.finnbay.com/italian-authorities-look-into-tripadvisor-for-improper-commercial-practices/ | work=Finnbay | title=Italian Authorities Look Into Tripadvisor For Improper Commercial Practices | date=2014-05-20 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Authority stated that Tripadvisor and its Italian arm should stop publishing misleading information about the sources of the reviews.  In June 2015, a fake restaurant created by a newspaper rose to the top of the site's rankings in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/tripadvisor-denies-rating-system-is-flawed-after-fake-restaurant-tops-rankings-in-italy-10354818.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Siobhan | last=Fenton | title=TripAdvisor denies rating system is flawed, after fake restaurant tops rankings in Italy | date=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ex-hotel manager at [[Meriton]] says that guests were offered inducements to change ratings they left on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-21/meriton-apartments-allegedly-cheating-tripadvisor-system/6870256|title=Meriton allegedly prevents guests from giving negative reviews, bribes them to improve ratings on TripAdvisor|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dietmar Doering, a German hotelier based in [[Sri Lanka]] accused TripAdvisor of hosting malicious reviews of his resort ''The Cosy Beach'' in [[Marawila]]. He claimed he was compelled to take legal action for the estimated damages of US$500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=TripAdvisor’s misleading reviews damage Sri Lankan resort’s global image|url=http://www.ft.lk/2015/03/27/tripadvisors-misleading-reviews-damage-sri-lankan-resorts-global-image|work=[[Daily FT]]|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=27 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402190159/http://www.ft.lk/2015/03/27/tripadvisors-misleading-reviews-damage-sri-lankan-resorts-global-image/|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, TripAdvisor was cited in two reports from the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=TripAdvisor removed warnings about rapes and injuries at Mexico resorts, tourists say|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/2017/11/01/tripadvisor-removed-warnings-rapes-and-injuries-mexico-resorts-tourists-say/817172001/|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CBS News]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=TripAdvisor accused of deleting reviews that raised red flags|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tripadvisor-accused-of-deleting-reviews-that-raised-red-flags/|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was responsible for deleting numerous reviews that raised red flags of complaisant criminal responsibility by resorts in [[Playa del Carmen]], a popular tourist resort in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]]. The reports cited that the company deleted reviews from two women who were raped at the Iberostar Paraiso Maya in separate incidents 2010 and 2015 respectively, one of which involved a hotel security guard. After assurances from hotel staff they would help out and contact the authorities but failed to take any follow-up action, the women took their advisories and warnings to TripAdvisor, which deleted their reviews. The first victim, Kristie Love, had her review eventually put back up on TripAdvisor's site successfully, while in the case of the second victim, Jamie Valeri, the company refused to budge after citing her report as "hearsay." The reports also highlighted at least a dozen other incidents at hotels and resorts across Mexico, including that of a 29-year-old man who was raped by a massage therapist at a resort in the same area, where reviewers had attempted to warn people through reviews on the company's site about criminal incidents that the resorts and local authorities had failed to pursue any criminal or legal action for, only to have those reviews either taken down or declined for posting by TripAdvisor.

In November 2017, Oobah Butler, a journalist for [[Vice Media]], used fake reviews to boost a nonexistent restaurant named [[The Shed at Dulwich]] to the top of Tripadvisor rankings for restaurants in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/dulwich-shed-becomes-tripadvisors-number-one-ranked-restaurant-in-london-after-fake-reviews-a3712606.html|title=Writer 'tricks' TripAdvisor into making his shed top London restaurant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prankster-oobah-butler-cooks-up-top-restaurant-the-shed-at-dulwich-fx6hfwj89|title=Prankster Oobah Butler tricks TripAdvisor into thinking his shed is London’s best restaurant|first=Valentine|last=Low|date=7 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/topic/the-shed-at-dulwich|title=The Shed At Dulwich|website=Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When questioned about its fraud-prevention systems, TripAdvisor responded that this type of fraud was not generally seen, because unlike artificially good reviews for a real restaurant, creating good reviews for a non-existent restaurant is not profitable.

The '''Virtual Centre for Knowledge on Europe''' (abbreviated '''CVCE''' from French: ''Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance de l'Europe'') is an interdisciplinary research and documentation centre dedicated to [[European integration]] studies. It develops a digital library of multimedia resources related to European unification efforts since World War II, including the defelopment of related international bodies such as the [[European Union]]. The library is available in English and French, though some documents are available in other languages.

The CVCE is based in [[Sanem Castle]] in [[Luxembourg]], and is supported by the Ministry of Culture, Higher Education and Research. It is a public corporation founded by law on 7 August 2002, and forms part of the [[University of Luxembourg]].

The digital library was formerly named the '''European NAvigator''' ('''ENA''').

The large multimedia knowledge base includes original texts (treaties, etc.), video and audio clips, press articles, photos, interactive maps, cartoons and tables.

==Parts==
* 'Historical Events' contains material on all the events that have contributed to the European integration process;
* 'European Organizations' looks at the operation of all the institutions of the [[European Union]] (e.g. [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]]) and the various other European institutions;
* 'Special Files' are devoted to specific subjects;
* 'Interviews' contains exclusive interviews with people who have played a part in the European integration process ([[Jacques Santer]], Otto von Habsburg, etc.);
* 'Research&amp; Teaching' provides resources for teachers to enable their pupils to learn about [[European integration]].

The '''Wittmoor bog trackway''' is the name given to each of two historic [[corduroy road]]s, trackway No. I being discovered in 1898 and trackway No. II in 1904&lt;ref&gt;The numbering of the trackways No. I for the younger northern one and No. II for the older southern one follows the local archive file of Archaeological Museum of Hamburg corresponding to early publications, in contrast to that Schindler uses a different numbering in his publication.&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Wittmoor'' [[bog]] in northern [[Hamburg]], Germany. The trackways date to the 4th and 7th century AD, both linked the eastern and western shores of the formerly inaccessible, swampy bog. A part of the older trackway No. II dating to the period of the [[Roman Empire]] is on display at the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic Mobility, Show case no. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Articus"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Articus | first1 =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication - Helms-Museum  | volume =103 | edition = | date =2013 | location = Hamburg | pages =108 | isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

[[File:Wittmoor west Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|View over the western part of the Wittmoor near the former western beginning of bog trackway No. II on the left side.]]

Both bog trackways are located in the Wittmoor bog in the Hamburg districts of [[Duvenstedt]], [[Lemsahl-Mellingstedt]] and the [[Norderstedt]] district of [[Glashütte]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Both trackways have been disturbed by historical [[peat]] cutters. In 1898 Ludwig Frahm, a local school teacher and historian followed a hint from Hinrich Mohr, a carpenter from [[Poppenbüttel]], showing him the location of what he called a [[Russia]]n [[causeway]] which is actually trackway No. I.&lt;ref name="Frahm_1930"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Frahm | first = Ludwig | title = Wie wir den ersten Bohlenweg auf dem Wittmoor fanden | journal = Jahrbuch des Alstervereins: 30 Jahre Alster-Verein | volume = 18 | publisher = Christiansen | location = Hamburg-Wandsbek | year = 1930 | pages = 26–29 | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ziesche"&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Ziesche | first = Ferdinand | title = Der Forscherdrang des Ludwig Frahm - Entdeckung im Wittmoor | journal = Alstertal-Magazin |date=November 2006 | pages = 118–119 |url=http://www.alster-net.de/alsternet/pdf/am-11-06/118-119.pdf|format=pdf| accessdate = 2012-09-19 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 Frahm excavated a few planks of the trackway, publishing his findings in 1901 and 1913. The two bog trackways found in Wittmoor were excellently preserved due to the moist, peaty soil.&lt;ref name="Schindler"&gt;{{ citation | last = Schindler | first= Reinhard | title = Die Bodenaltertümer der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg | publisher = Hans Christians | location = Hamburg | year = 1960 | pages = 119–121, Annex 1 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bog trackway No. I ==

[[File:Bohlenweg Wittmoor nord.png|thumb|Schematic drawing of a part of the trackway No. I planks in cross-section, plan view and longitudinal section]]

Bog trackway I (location: {{coord|53.702829|10.0717169|dim:500_type:landmark_region:DE-HH}}&lt;ref name="Schindler"/&gt;) was discovered in 1898, in 1900 and 1901 Frahm [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] a part of the trackway together with Prof. Wilms&lt;ref name="Frahm_1930"/&gt; and it was re-examined by the [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] Prejawa and Kolumbe in the 1930s. The trackway ran in southeasterly direction through the Wittmoor and had a length of about {{convert|500|m|ft}}. Even during [[World War II]] most of the western part of the pead bog were cut for fuel production which destroyed large sections of the trackway. This bog trackway was built up in a much easier technique than the older bog trackway II The path consisted of clean-hewn [[oak]] planks ranging from {{convert|180|cm|in}} to {{convert|200|cm|in}} in length and {{convert|20|cm|in}} to {{convert|30|cm|in}} width laid directly on the surface of the bog. The trackway was embedded in the peat in a depth of only {{convert|1|m|ft}} from below the surface. Also in this part of the bog peat was regularly taken for fuel production, which gradually destroyed the trackway. The well-preserved wooden planks of the way were taken by the peat cutters and used as [[firewood]].&lt;ref name="Schindler"/&gt;

== Bog trackway No. II ==

[[File:Bohlenweg Wittmoor süd.png|thumb|300px|Schematic drawing of a part of trackway No. II cross section, plan view and longitudinal section]]

Bog trackway No. II (location: {{coord|53.699984|10.069399|dim:690_type:landmark_region:DE-HH}}&lt;ref name="Schindler"/&gt;) was discovered in 1904 by Hamburg state [[geologist]] Dr. Wolff. It too runs in a southeasterly direction through the Wittmoor, and had a length of about {{convert|600|m|ft}} and was located parallel to and {{circa}} {{convert|500|m|ft}} south-southwest of trackway No. I. This path was gradually destroyed through regular peat cutting. In 1947 approximately {{convert|2|m|ft}} of the central part was excavated by Kellermann in 1947 which is now on displayed in the permanent collection of the Archaeological Museum in Hamburg. The substructure of the road consisted of two split oak planks that were placed parallel to each other on a sand or gravel foundation on the formerly swampy terrain. The thresholds were piles of split oak boards ranging from about {{convert|130|cm|in}} to {{convert|160|cm|in}} in length,  widths between {{convert|25|cm|in}} and {{convert|45|cm|in}} and thickness of {{convert|2|cm|in}} to {{convert|6|cm|in}} laid transverse to the direction of the path. The thresholds were notched so as to prevent slipping on the boards. Every second threshold was cut diagonally at the ends. Through the gaps [[birch]] poles were driven into the ground to prevent slipping of the thresholds. A large part of the excavated path resembled a building site, the woods were torn out of the path way and thrown together in one place. Beside it newly trimmed timbers were found which were designed to be built in the new way, as well as items interpreted as tools, like a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] and [[mallet]]. Charred small pieces of wood indicating a fireplace.&lt;ref name="Schindler"/&gt; In 1938 the bog trackway was initially [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dated]] by [[pollen analysis]] to the 6th century BC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Preiawa | first = H. | title = Die Bohlenwege im Wittmoor | journal = Mitteilungen des Anthropologischen Vereins in Schleswig-Holstein | publisher = Lipsius &amp; Tische | location = Kiel | volume = 19 | year = 1901 | issn = 0179-9703 | pages = 57–67 | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, a [[radiocarbon dating]] performed in 1957 yielded an age nearer the beginning of the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Averdieck | first1 = R. |last2 = Münnich | first2 = | title = Palynologische Betrachtungen zur Siedlungsgeschichte im Norden Hamburgs unter Zuhilfenahme neuerer Datierungsmethoden | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 9 | publisher = | location = | year = 1957 | language = German | issn = 0173-0886}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] dating performed in 1996 yielded a felling date of the trees around the 330 AD&lt;ref name="Articus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thieme | first = Wulf | title = Alte Wege über das Moor | editor = H.

== Interpretation ==

The discovery of the two bog trackways disproved the old doctrine that such bog trackways only occurred south of the river [[Elbe]].&lt;ref name="Ziesche"/&gt; They show that in earlier times, a lively exchange between the western and eastern shores of the marshland occurred, and that the routes were considered so important that a significant logistical and substantive effort was expended to build paths through the marsh rather than circumvent the area. No archaeological evidence for settlements have been detected belonging to the bog trackways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thieme | first = Wulf | title = 9.
