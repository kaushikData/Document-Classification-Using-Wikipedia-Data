The '''Abertay Historical Society''' ('''AHS''')  is a [[historical society]] based in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]]. It aims to promote interest in history, with a special focus on the history of [[Perthshire]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] and [[Fife]]. The AHS runs a regular programme of public lectures on historical topics and also organises special events. The Society also publishes books, usually producing at least one publication per year.&lt;ref name="Abertay home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abertay Historical Society|url=http://www.abertay.org.uk/|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Society was founded at a meeting held at [[University of Dundee|University College, Dundee]] on 29 May 1947. The founders were the Principal of University College, Major-General [[Douglas Wimberley]], and the College's history lecturer, Dr Frederick T Wainwright. &lt;ref name="About us"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.abertay.org.uk/about-us.html|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|accessdate=10 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303141343/http://www.abertay.org.uk/about-us.html|archive-date=3 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the Society was promoted as part of a process of developing 'town and gown links' in Dundee by Wimberley.&lt;ref name="University"&gt;{{cite news|title=University Established|url=http://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-courier-advertiser-perth-and-perthshire-edition/20170202/282179355813920|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=The Courier &amp; Advertiser (Perth &amp; Perthshire Edition)|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AHS was set up with the goal of encouraging the study of local history in the [[River Tay|Abertay area]] (Perthshire, Angus and northern Fife).&lt;ref name="About us"/&gt;The Society pursued this aim by organising regular talks and lectures as well as other events such as excursions.&lt;ref name="About us"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SLH&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Kenneth|title=Abertay Historical Society: 65th Birthday|journal=Scottish Local History|date=Autumn 2012|issue=84|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society formerly had an [[Archaeological]] Section which organised excavations in the local area and its own series of meetings. However, in 1993 the activities of this section came under the control of the Society’s Council.&lt;ref name=Archives&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 21 Abertay Historical Society|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%2021%27%29|work=Archives Services Online Catalogue|publisher=[[University of Dundee]]|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time in the 1970s the AHS also had an Industrial Archaeology Section, which mainly sought to record the region's industrial heritage.&lt;ref name=Archives/&gt; In 2015 the archaeological activities of the Society were taken over by a newly established fieldwork division, which has undertaken projects including the recording of stones that survive from the demolished [[Royal Arch (structure)|Dundee Royal Arch]].&lt;ref name=Archives/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fieldwork"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fieldwork Division|url=https://abertay.org.uk/fieldwork-division/|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1953 the Society has published books on local history, the first of which was ''Dundee and the [[American Civil War]]'' by David Carrie. A number of notable historians and authors have written volumes published by the Society including Bruce Lenman, [[Andrew Murray Scott]] and [[Christopher Whatley]].&lt;ref name=Courier&gt;{{cite news|title=Rare Publications Will Be Available Online|newspaper=The Courier|date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 51st AHS publication ''Ten Taysiders: Forgotten Figures from Dundee, Angus and Perthshire'' was published in 2011 and was edited by members of the Society's Council.&lt;ref name="Ten Taysiders"&gt;{{cite news|title=New book tells the stories of 10 'forgotten' Taysiders|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/Community/Heritage-and-History/article/12686/new-book-tells-the-stories-of-10-forgotten-taysiders.html|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=The Courier|date=9 April 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the AHS began to make copies of out-of-print titles available for free download from their website.&lt;ref name=Courier/&gt; The Society's publications are regularly cited in academic literature.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;

As well as running events, the AHS has undertaken various heritage activities. The Society has lobbied for the preservation of local buildings and historic sites, and played a key role in the creation of [[Dundee Civic Trust]] and [[Dundee Heritage Trust]].&lt;ref name="About us"/&gt; The Abertay Historical Society was also a benefactor of [[McManus Galleries|The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery and Museum]] Fundraising Appeal which allowed the restoration and refurbishment of Dundee's main museum and galleries between 2006 and 2009.&lt;ref name=McManus&gt;{{cite web|title=Donations/Supporters. The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery and Museum Fundraising Appeal|url=http://www.mcmanus.co.uk/content/home/donationssupporters|publisher=The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery and Museum|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of notable individuals have been associated with the Abertay Historical Society. These include Sir [[Francis Mudie]] who was President of the Society from 1963 to 1965 and also contributed to its publications.&lt;ref name="Broughty Castle"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mudie|first=Sir Francis, Walker, David. M., and MacIvor, Iain|title=Broughty Castle and the Defence of the Tay|year=2010|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|location=Dundee|isbn=978-0-900019-47-0|pages=iv &amp; 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another key figure in the society's history was  S. G. Edgar Lythe, a founder member who went on to be Vice Principal of the [[University of Strathclyde]]. Lythe, who edited and wrote several of the Society's publications, was credited with moving the AHS away from simply organising events and towards actively encouraging research into local history.&lt;ref name="SGE Lythe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ogilvy|first=Graham|title=Prof Edgar Lythe|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/prof-edgar-lythe-1.412865|accessdate=14 February 2012|newspaper=The Herald|date=13 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dundee bibliophile and antiquarian Catherine Kinnear was a founder member of the Society and later went on to be its president.&lt;ref name=Kinnear&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 103 Kinnear Collection|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%20103%27%29)|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The AHS has been described as "one of Scotland's most successful local history organisations".&lt;ref name="SGE Lythe"/&gt; It organises a regular programme of evening lectures, which are usually held in Discovery Point, Dundee, although other venues are also used from time to time. These lectures cover a wide range of topics relating to the local area.&lt;ref name="Abertay home"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About us"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Contact us"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact Us|url=http://www.abertay.org.uk/contact-us.html|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|accessdate=10 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303141350/http://www.abertay.org.uk/contact-us.html|archive-date=3 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society also works with other Dundee-based groups to run the Dundee Afternoon Lectures series. The AHS is a registered charity.&lt;ref name="About us"/&gt;

Some events are held jointly with other local groups. For example, in 2010 the AHS joined with the Perth Strathspey and Reel Society to have an event at the A. K. Bell Library, [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] entitled "The Fiddle Music of Perth" as part of the Perth 800 celebrations.&lt;ref name="Fiddle Music"&gt;{{cite news|title=Perth800 takes a bow|url=http://www.perthshireadvertiser.co.uk/perthshire-news/local-news-perthshire/2010/04/16/perth800-takes-a-bow-73103-26250688/|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=Perthshire Advertiser|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the AHS contributed to the Dundee Science Festival by organising a public lecture on the design and construction of the [[Bell Rock Lighthouse]].&lt;ref name="Science Festival"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dundee Science Festival 2011|url=http://www.dundeesciencefestival.org/holding/DundeeScienceFestival.pdf|accessdate=14 February 2012|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society is a partner in Great War Dundee, a project commemorating the [[First World War]], and its impact on [[Dundee]] set up to mark the centenary of the conflict.&lt;ref name=GWDabout&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.greatwardundee.com/about/|website=Great War Dundee|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GWDpart&gt;{{cite web|title=Partner Information|url=http://www.greatwardundee.com/about/partner-information/|website=Great War Dundee|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Office Bearers==

The Society is run by a council whose membership includes the President, General Secretary, other office bearers and various ordinary members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Session LXV  2011-2012 Syllabus of Meetings|year=2011|publisher=Abertay Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taysiders&gt;{{cite book|last=Various|title=Ten Taysiders:Forgotten Figures from Dundee, Angus and Perthshire|year=2011|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|location=Dundee|isbn=978-0-900019-48-7|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the [[Lord Provost of Dundee]], the Provost of [[Perth and Kinross]], the Provost of [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], the Principal of the [[University of Dundee]] and the Principal of the [[University of St Andrews]] all serve as Honorary Presidents of the Society.&lt;ref name=Taysiders/&gt;

==Relationship with the University of Dundee==

As noted above the Abertay Historical Society was founded at what was then University College, Dundee by my members of that institution's staff. Since that time the AHS has maintained close links with the institution, which has since 1967 been known as the [[University of Dundee]]. The Principal of the University of Dundee is one five Honorary Presidents of the Society, and many of the Society's members and office-holders, including past presidents, have been University staff and students. Equally many of its publications have been authored by figures connected with the University and the AHS' lecture programme has offers University staff and students the chance to present their research to the local community.&lt;ref name="About us"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archives/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taysiders/&gt;&lt;ref name=E-ARMMS2&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Taysiders book launch

An annual prize is awarded by the AHS to the undergraduate at the University of Dundee who produces the dissertation which makes the most significant contribution to local history.&lt;ref name="About us"/&gt; Some of these dissertations have been expanded and published by the AHS. For example, the AHS publication No. 44 ''Scottish Cowboys and the Dundee Investors'' by Claire E. Swan evolved from a dissertation which won the Abertay History Prize in 2003.&lt;ref name=cowboys&gt;{{cite book|last=Swan|first=Claire E.|title=Scottish Cowboys and the Dundee Investors|year=2004|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|location=Dundee|isbn=0-900019-40-9|page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Julie Danskin, author of the Society's 54th publication is also a past winner of the Abertay History Prize.&lt;ref name="Dundee's Own"&gt;{{cite book|last=Danskin|first=Julie|title=A City At War The 4th Black Watch - Dundee's Own|year=2013|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|location=Dundee|isbn=978-0-900019-51-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archives of the AHS are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee.&lt;ref name=Archives/&gt;&lt;ref name=E-ARMMS7/&gt;

Currently most of the Society's lectures are held at the University, usually in the Dalhousie Building.&lt;ref name="Abertay home"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abertay Historical Society delve into textile history|url=http://www.forfardispatch.co.uk/news/local-news/the-abertay-historical-society-delve-into-textile-history-1-2673956|accessdate=5 December 2015|work=Forfar Dispatch|date=2 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208062341/http://www.forfardispatch.co.uk/news/local-news/the-abertay-historical-society-delve-into-textile-history-1-2673956|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The first publication by the society was ''Dundee and the American Civil War'' which was published in 1953. An editorial note in the publication announced that it was hoped it was to 'be followed by others of similar
character, produced to a uniform size to simplify binding into convenient volumes'.&lt;ref name=Carrie&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrie|first1=David C.|title=Dundee and the American Civil War|date=1953|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|location=Dundee|page=3|url=http://abertay.org.uk/images/docs/DundeeAmericanCivilWar.pdf|accessdate=24 December 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also stated that while its publications would 'always have a strong local flavour the Society aims to
avoid undue parochialism and seeks to set its studies against the wide backcloth of general historical development'.&lt;ref name=Carrie/&gt;  As of December 2015 the Society has published a further 55 books relating to the history of Tayside and Fife.&lt;ref name=Publications&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications|url=http://www.abertay.org.uk/publications.html|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|accessdate=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918232448/http://www.abertay.org.uk/publications.html|archive-date=18 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rice&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Catherine|title="All their Good Friends and Neighbours" The story of a vanished hamlet in Angus|date=2014|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|location=Dundee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Society are sent a free copy of each new publication, while other copies are made available for sale either from the Society or via booksellers.&lt;ref name="Abertay home"/&gt; The publications have covered a wide number of topics and have varied in style. While most are monographs some titles have been collections of essays written by various authors. An example of the latter is the 2011 publication ''Ten Taysiders'' which featured biographical essays on ten historic figures from Dundee, Pethshire and Angus, such as [[Mary Ann Baxter]], [[Arthur Kinmond Bell|A.K. Bell]] and [[William Sharpey]] and which was written by various authors including Steve Connelly, Fiona Scharlau, Charles Waterston, Graham Lowe, John MacEwen, John Kerr, William Kenefick and Kenneth Baxter.&lt;ref name="Ten Taysiders"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Contact/&gt;

In 1996, San Jose Mercury News, owned by media conglomerate [[Knight Ridder|Knight Ridder,]] established ''Nuevo Mundo'' and its Spanish language weekly subsidiary to compete directly with the three local Hispanic-owned papers: ''La Ofreta'', ''El Observador'', and ''Alianza''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/05.29.97/spanish-press-9722.html|title=Metroactive News &amp; Issues {{!}} Hispanic Newspapers|website=www.metroactive.com|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within months of its launch, Nuevo Mundo began drawing readership and advertising away from the three papers, causing financial troubles for the local papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/05.29.97/spanish-press-9722.html|title=Metroactive News &amp; Issues {{!}} Hispanic Newspapers|website=www.metroactive.com|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 Mercury News shut down its foreign language subsidiaries including ''Nuevo Mundo.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://juantornoe.blogs.com/hispanictrending/2005/10/san_jose_mercur.html|title=HispanicTrending: San Jose Mercury News unloads foreign language newspapers|website=juantornoe.blogs.com|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12115">In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] surveyed 1,000 people from the world of British film and television to produce the BFI 100 list of the greatest [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British films]] of the 20th century. Voters were asked to choose up to 100 films that were 'culturally British'.&lt;ref name="BFI (1999)" /&gt; The list also includes two non-British films, namely ''[[My Left Foot]]'' and ''[[The Commitments (film)|The Commitments]]''.

==List breakdown==
* The 1960s led the pack with 26 films of merit for the decade.  Four films made the list from each of the years 1949, 1963, and 1971.  The earliest film selected was ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935). Only two other 1930s films made the list, and after 1935, the only years not represented are 1936–1937, 1940–1941, 1950, 1956, 1958, 1972 and 1974–78.
* [[David Lean]], with seven films, is the most-represented director in the list, followed by [[Michael Powell]] (five films, of which four were collaborations with [[Emeric Pressburger]]). [[Powell and Pressburger]] ("The Archers") and [[John Schlesinger]] had four films each, while [[Alexander Mackendrick]] and [[Tony Richardson]] each had three. Seven of the films were produced by [[Ealing Studios]] during the years 1949–55.
* The most-represented actor is [[Alec Guinness]] with nine films of merit, although three appearances were in supporting roles. [[Michael Caine]] is the most represented living actor, starring in seven films.
* [[Julie Christie]] is the most represented actress, with six films on the list.
* All of the directors in the list are male.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4391">{{About|the printed books based on blogs|the card game|Bluke|internet books, also sometimes called blooks|Online book}}

A '''blook''' is a printed book that contains or is based on content from a [[blog]].

The first printed blook was User Interface Design for Programmers, by [[Joel Spolsky]], published by Apress on June 26, 2001, based on his blog [[Joel on Software]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} An early blook was written by Tony Pierce in 2002 when he compiled selected posts from his one-year-old blog and turned the collection into a book called "Blook".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonypierce.com/blog/2002_11_03_blogarc.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517182557/http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2002_11_03_blogarc.htm |archivedate=17 May 2008 |title=tonypierce.com + bushblog |website=tony pierce dot com |accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name came about when Pierce held a contest, asking his readers to suggest a title for the book. [[Jeff Jarvis]] of BuzzMachine won the contest and subsequently invented the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2002_12_21.html#002759 |title=Posts from December 21, 2002 |date=21 December 2002 |website=BuzzMachine |accessdate=18 January 2014 |first=Jeff |last=Jarvis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce went on to publish two other blooks, How To Blog and Stiff.

[[Print-on-demand]] publisher [[Lulu (publisher)|Lulu]] inaugurated the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]] for blooks, which was first awarded in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/apr/03/news.newmedia1|title=From blog to book: first awards for online writers who became mainstream successes|last=Gibson|first=Owen|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 April 2006|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The printed blook phenomenon is not limited to self-publishing. Several popular bloggers have signed book deals with major publishers to write books based on their blogs. However, some publishers are starting to realize that blog popularity does not translate to sales. Blog to book conversions via traditional publishing houses still happen, but the focus has shifted from blog popularity to content quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amny.com/entertainment/am-blogbook1211,0,5596105,full.story |title=The sharp rise (and quick fall) of the bloggers' books |date=11 December 2007 |first=Kara |last=Warner |website=am New York |archivedate=11 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511213548/http://www.amny.com/entertainment/am-blogbook1211%2C0%2C5596105%2Cfull.story |accessdate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Blook" was short-listed in 2006 for inclusion in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and was a runner-up for Word of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/10/12/bovvered_wins_word_of_the_year_award.html/ |title='Bovvered' wins Word of the Year award |website=The Guardian |first=Sarah |last=Phillips |date=12 October 2006 |archivedate=10 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610210543/http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2006/oct/12/bovveredwinsw1 |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|2}}

==History==
The [[Brooklyn Museum]] evolved from the Brooklyn Apprentices' Library Association, founded in 1823, and the first free and circulating library in Brooklyn. In 1831, the library acquired its first painting, joining a developing book collection. According to the Minutes of the Apprentices' Library from January 31, 1835: "[[Walter Whitman]] acting librarian presented a Report this evening, in which it is stated that there are now about 1200 volumes in the library in a proper 
state for being drawn out; and that the number of Readers is 172."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Minutes of the Brooklyn Apprentices' Library Association, 1:84.|journal=Brooklyn Museum Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1840s, the public demand for educational programs resulted in the reorganization of the library with the adoption by the association of a revised charter under the name of the Brooklyn Institute and the library was housed in a new building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Deirdre|title=The Evolution of a Library: The Brooklyn Museum of Art Libraries and Archives|journal=Art Documentation|date=1999|volume=18|issue=1|pages=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evening classes were offered, the first exhibition of paintings was held and library acquisition funds became available. The library accession records document early institutional interest in the world at large. An early acquisition is currently in the museum's long term installation, ''Connecting Cultures''.

Over the next forty years, the Brooklyn Institute grew and was reorganized into the Brooklyn Institute of Arts &amp; Sciences, which eventually became the parent organization of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]], the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM) and the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]]. During the late 1880s, plans were established to revitalize the institute in order ″to make the property of the Institute the nucleus of a broad and comprehensive institution for the advancement of science and art...″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. Third Yearbook of the Brooklyn Institute|date=1891|publisher=Brooklyn: Press of Eagle Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an architectural competition held in 1893, the firm of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] was chosen to design a building to house the Brooklyn Museum and its library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Deirdre|title=The Evolution of a Library: The Brooklyn Museum of Art Libraries and Archives|journal=Art Documentation|date=1999|volume=18|issue=1|pages=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 1900s saw reorganization of the original Apprentices' Library by the museum librarians who kept portions of the collection that supported research on the museum's object collections and transferred the rest to other libraries in Brooklyn and other institutions.

[[William Henry Goodyear]], the museum's first Curator of Fine Arts (1890-1923), founding museum librarian Susan A. Hutchinson (1900–35) and [[Stewart Culin]], the museum's first Curator of Ethnology (1903–29), laid the foundation of the research and object collections. Some of the rarest material in the library collection today, such as a set of documentary photographs of Mexico and Central America taken by [[Alfred P. Maudslay]] in the 1880s, was acquired under their direction. After Stewart Culin died, the trustees acquired his archives and personal library of nearly 7,000 titles, focused primarily on the arts and culture of the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Deirdre|title=The Evolution of a Library: The Brooklyn Museum of Art Libraries and Archives|journal=Art Documentation|date=1999|volume=18|issue=1|pages=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Libraries==

Today the Brooklyn Museum has two research libraries—the Art Reference Library and the Wilbour Library of Egyptology—in addition to the museum archives which support research on the museum, its history and collections as well as the broader areas of art and cultural history.

===Wilbour Library of Egyptology===
The Wilbour Library is named after [[Charles Edwin Wilbour]], 1833–96, one of America's first Egyptologists. During his travels to Egypt, Wilbour visited temples and tombs and copied inscriptions found on monuments in the field. He built an important resource on Ancient Egypt by collecting books from fellow Egyptologists abroad, as well as from dealers and scholarly publishers, developing his personal library as a resource to educate himself. Wilbour's personal library was enriched with scholarly annotations containing corrections and additions to the published text which are of value today as they offer unique information. In 1916, Wilbour's children offered his antiquities and library collection to the Brooklyn Museum as a memorial to their father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Compiled by|last2=Cook, Jr.|first2=William Burt|title=Catalogue of the Egyptological and Other Books From the Collection of the Late Edwin Wilbour|date=1924|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this initial donation, Wilbour's heirs continued to donate objects to the museum. In 1932, the Charles Edwin Wilbour Fund was set up by Victor Wilbour to support both the library and the Egyptian collection at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Mark|title=Wilbour's Legacy|journal=Archaeology|date=August 18, 2005|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/reviews/wilbour/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fazzini|first1=Richard A.|last2=Romano|first2=James F.|last3=Cody|first3=Madeleine E.|title=Art for eternity : masterworks from ancient Egypt|date=1999|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art, in association with Scala Publishers|location=Brooklyn, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Archives===
In 1985, the Brooklyn Museum established the archives as part of the library. Textual and visual materials are available to support users in understanding the museum's object collections as well as its history and programs. Exchanges between curators and artists, collectors and donors, as well as exhibition files containing information on specific artists or works of art that have been exhibited at the museum, and object documentation tracing how an object was acquired, and more can all be found in the archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Deirdre|title=The Evolution of a Library: The Brooklyn Museum of Art Libraries and Archives|journal=Art Documentation|date=1999|volume=18|issue=1|pages=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection highlights===
Today the Brooklyn Museum Library collections are encyclopedic in scope and parallel the strength of the museum's collections. In addition to being a research center, the library collections are frequently exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum and elsewhere. Collection highlights include special collections of fashion sketches, documentary photographs, artists’ books, trade catalogs and other rare books.

====Costume and Fashion Sketch Collection====
Highlights of the fashion sketch collection include sketches by [[Elizabeth Hawes]], [[Bonnie Cashin]], [[Walter Plunkett]] and a full visual record of every design imported or created by [[Henri Bendel]] from 1912 to 1950. The museum's website has images of such collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libraries and Archives: Fashion and Costume Sketch Collection, 1912-1950|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/archives/set/198/fashion_and_costume_sketch_collection_1912-1950|website=Brooklyn Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Henri Bendel Collection=====
In the spring of 1942, the Brooklyn Museum Libraries sent a questionnaire to seventy-five designers requesting biographical information along with sketches of their work. The questionnaire was announced in [[Women's Wear Daily]].  [[Henri Bendel]] sent a large collection of sketches rendered by design artists employed by the retailer. The artists attended Parisian shows to record the work of more than 170 designers including [[Balenciaga]], [[Chanel]], [[Dior]], [[Jeanne Lanvin|Lanvin]], [[Poiret]], [[Elsa Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli]], [[Vionnet]], and [[Charles Frederick Worth|Worth]]. In 1944, sketches from the collection were featured in an exhibition at the museum, [https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/1776/French_Fashion_Sketches_from_the_Henri_Bendel_Collection French Fashion Sketches from the Henri Bendel Collection].

Today, the Henri Bendel Collection represents the largest and one of the first sketch collections received, with more than 11,000 sketches of French couture imported by the company in addition to its own house designs from 1912 through 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Nancy E. Friedland|title=Documenting: Costume Design|url=http://arcade.nyarc.org/search~S2?/XDocumenting%3A+Costume+Design&amp;searchscope=2&amp;SORT=D/XDocumenting%3A+Costume+Design&amp;searchscope=2&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=Documenting%3A+Costume+Design/1%2C5%2C5%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=XDocumenting%3A+Costume+Design&amp;searchscope=2&amp;SORT=D&amp;1%2C1%2C|accessdate=20 August 2015|date=2010|publisher=The Theatre Library Association|pages=94–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Artists Books====
[[Artists books]] are a special feature of the library collection with a focus on Brooklyn-based artists; artists who are exhibited by the museum or who have work in the museum’s object collection; artists who create work that relates to the objects or cultures that are represented in the museum’s object collections; artists who are considered to be innovators or masters in the artists books world. Recent donations include artists books from the library of [http://arcade.nyarc.org/search~S4/?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=From+the+Library+of+Arnold+Smoller.&amp;searchscope=4&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xsmoller%26SORT%3DDZ Arnold Smoller] and the library of [http://arcade.nyarc.org/search~S2/?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=From+the+Library+of+Thea+Westreich%2FEthan+Wagner.westreich&amp;searchscope=2&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xwestreich%26SORT%3DDZ Thea Westreich and Ethan Wagner].

The exhibition entitled ''Artist Books'', held in 2000, featured 50 books ranging from multiples to limited edition to unique works from the library collection. From 2003 to 2006, the museum featured key works from the Wilbour Library of Egyptology in a two part exhibition entitled ''Egypt Through Other Eyes: Early Travel and Exploration and the Popularization of Ancient Egypt'', that examined how Western writers and artists saw and recorded Egypt from early works on hieroglyphs to the discovery of [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Mark|title=Wilbour's Legacy|journal=Archaeology|date=August 18, 2005|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/reviews/wilbour/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital collections===
In an effort to provide greater access to the collections, the Brooklyn Museum Libraries have been digitizing parts of its collections. Some digital projects include the Gilded Age Project, the Bendel Fashion sketches, and Brooklyn Visual Heritage. A multi-year collaboration with [[Pratt Institute]]'s School of Information and Library Science is underway to provide a training ground for librarians and archivists and to make the library and archive collections more accessible via digital means.

==New York Art Resources Consortium==
{{Main article|New York Art Resources Consortium}}
In 2006, The Libraries of the Brooklyn Museum, The Frick, and The Museum of Modern Art joined forces to form the [[New York Art Resources Consortium]] (NYARC). In addition to other projects, they have collaborated to build an integrated library system, known as Arcade.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=Groundbreaking Partnership Unites Decades of Research|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/arts/artsspecial/18LIBRARY.html|publisher=New York Times|date=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide better access to their respective collections.

==Visiting==
During the renovation on the 2nd floor of the Brooklyn Museum, the libraries are open with limited access to researchers. The libraries and archives are scheduled to reopen to the public in the fall of 2016. When the floor is reopened it will feature a new Gallery of Libraries and Archives as well as newly reinstalled Asian and Islamic art galleries.

[[File:StammtafelOttonen0002.jpg|thumb|upright|Family tree of the [[Ottonians]], from the Wolfenbüttel manuscript (Cod. Guelf. 74.3 Aug., p. 226)]]
The '''''Chronica sancti Pantaleonis''''', also called the '''''Annales sancti Panthaleonis Coloniensis maximi''''', is a [[medieval Latin]] [[universal history]] written at the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery of [[St. Pantaleon's Church, Cologne|Saint Pantaleon in Cologne]]. It was written in 1237 and covers the history of the world in a series of annals from [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] down to the year of composition. A continuation down to 1249 was added later. Up to the year 1199 it relies heavily on other sources; from 1200 it is an independent source.

The ''Chronica'' emphasises the [[Four kingdoms of Daniel|four "great kingdoms" of ''Daniel'']] (the ''regna maxima''). For ancient history, it relies on [[Flavius Josephus]], [[Paulus Orosius]], [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]], the Venerable [[Bede]], [[Regino of Prüm]] and [[Petrus Comestor]]. For more recent events in Germany the annalist used the ''Chronicon universale'' of [[Frutolf von Michelsberg]], the chronicle of [[Ekkehard von Aura]] and the ''[[Chronica regia Coloniensis]]''.

The manuscripts from [[Brussels]] and [[Wolfenbüttel]] are richly illustrated with images of rulers and genealogical trees. The ''Chronica'' does not seem to have circulated widely outside of the region around Cologne.

The '''''Collins-Robert French Dictionary''''' (marketed as '''''Le Robert et Collins Dictionnaire Français-Anglais''''' in [[France]]) is a bilingual dictionary of English and French derived from the Collins Word Web, an analytical linguistics database.  As well as its primary function as a bilingual dictionary, it also contains usage guides for English and French (known as ''Grammaire Active'' and ''Language in Use'' respectively), English and French verb tables, and maps of English and French speaking areas.

Its two main competitors are ''[[Harrap's Shorter French Dictionary]]'' published by [[Chambers Harrap|Chambers Harrap Publishers]] and the ''[[Oxford-Hachette French Dictionary: French-English English-French|Oxford-Hachette French Dictionary]]'' published by [[Oxford University Press]] in conjunction with [[Louis Christophe François Hachette|Hachette]].

'''Synchronous''' and '''asynchronous transmissions''' are two different methods of [[data transmission|transmission]] [[Synchronization#Communication|synchronization]]. Synchronous transmissions are synchronized by an external clock, while asynchronous transmissions are synchronized by special signals along the transmission medium.

==The need for synchronization==
Whenever an [[electronic device]] transmits digital (and sometimes analog) data to another, there must be a certain rhythm established between the two devices, i.e., the receiving device must  have some way of, within the context of the fluctuating signal that it's receiving, determining where each unit of data begins and where it ends.

==Methods of synchronization==
There are two ways to synchronize the two ends of the communication.

The synchronous signalling methods use two different signals.
A pulse on one signal indicates when another bit of information is ready on the other signal.

The asynchronous signalling methods use only one signal.
The receiver uses transitions on that signal to figure out the transmitter bit rate ("[[autobaud]]") and timing, and set a local clock to the proper timing, typically using a [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL) to synchronize with the transmission rate.
A pulse from the local clock indicates when another bit is ready.

===Synchronous transmission===
In synchronous communications, the stream of data to be transferred is encoded as fluctuating voltage levels in one wire (the 'DATA'), and a periodic pulse of voltage on a separate wire (called the "CLOCK" or "STROBE") which tells the receiver "the current DATA bit is 'valid' at this moment in time".

Practically all [[parallel communications]] protocols use synchronous transmission. For example, in a computer, address information is transmitted synchronously—the address bits over the [[address bus]], and the read or write 'strobe's of the [[control bus]].

[[Image:EmbeddedSynchronousSignalling.png|thumb|350px|Single-wire synchronous signalling]]

A logical one is indicated when there are two transitions in the same time frame as a zero. In the Manchester coding a transition from low to high indicates a one and a transition from high to low indicates a zero. When there are successive ones or zeros, an opposite transition is required on the edge of the time frame to prepare for the next transition and signal.

===Asynchronous transmission===
The most common asynchronous signalling, [[asynchronous start-stop]] signalling, uses a near-constant 'bit' timing (+/- 5% local oscillator required at both end of the connection). Using this method, the receiver detects the 'first' edge transition... (the START BIT), waits 'half a bit duration' and then reads the value of the signal. A further delay of one 'whole bit duration' is executed before the next data bit is 'read' - repeating for length of the whole serial word (typically 7/8-data bits).
Finally an optional STOP bit is appended to identify the end of the data word.

The word structure used in typical asynchronous serial communications is START-DATA[0:7]-STOP[0:1] (followed by an optional PARITY bit).  These formatting variables are specified when configuring the transmit and receive nodes before communications take place.
The bit duration is determined from the nominated 'bit rate' in bps... 300, 1200, 9600, 19200, 115200 etc.  The use of the word BAUD is not strictly correct in the modern application of serial channels.

Special level &amp; timing conditions are detected to identify an open-circuit condition (BREAK)

The sync token might be a single pulse (a "start bit" as noted above), or it may be a more complicated [[syncword]] or [[self-synchronizing code]] such as [[HDLC]] or [[8B/10B encoding]].

==Advantages and disadvantages==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!

! ''Advantages''
! Disadvantages
|-
| Asynchronous transmission
|
* Simple, doesn't require synchronization of both communication sides
* Cheap, because asynchronous transmission requires less hardware
* Setup is faster than other transmissions, so well suited for applications where messages are generated at irregular intervals, for example data entry from the keyboard, and the speed depends on different applications.
| 
* Large relative overhead, a high proportion of the transmitted bits are uniquely for control purposes and thus carry no useful information
|-
| Synchronous transmission
|
* Lower overhead and thus, greater throughput
|
* Slightly more complex
* Hardware is more expensive

==History==
The work was begun in 1925 by [[William A. Craigie]]. The first volume appeared in 1936 under the editorship of Craigie and James R. Hulbert,&lt;ref&gt;University of Chicago Library, Special Collections Research Center, Guide to the James R. Hulbert Papers,1912–1936 [http://ead.lib.uchicago.edu/view.xqy?id=ICU.SPCL.HULBERTJ&amp;c=h]&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of English at the University of Chicago. The four volume edition was completed with the help of George Watson and [[Allen Walker Read]].

The work was one of the sources for the ''[[Dictionary of Americanisms]]'', c. 1952, prepared under the direction of Mitford Mathews.  A similar, but unrelated modern work, the ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]],'' has been compiled to show dialect variation.

== History ==

The EECTF has been established on June 30, 2009 by an agreement between [[United States Secret Service]], [[Ministry of Interior (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] and [[Poste Italiane]], on the basis of the successful experiences of analogous ECTFs founded in USA by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]].
&lt;br /&gt;
[[United States Secret Service]] participates through the [[Rome]] Office, the [[Ministry of Interior (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Interior]] participates through the Service of Postal and Telecommunications Police and Poste Italiane participates through the [[Information Security]] [[Departmentalization|Department]]. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Initially restricted to the only Founder Members, the EECTF has been opened thereafter to the main stakeholders in [[cybercrime]], who expressed the will to contribute to a [[proactive]] sharing of relevant information and a Permanent Members Group has been started, who gather to analyze emerging trends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camera: commissione Trasporti, oggi dalle 14 audizioni su sicurezza reti|url=http://www.asca.it/newsregioni-Camera__commissione_Trasporti__oggi_dalle_14_audizioni_su_sicurezza_reti-1230646-.html|date=December 2012|agency=ASCA|language=Italian|format=Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Hearing of the EECTF Chairman at the Chamber of Deputies of Italian Parliament on EECTF activities and trends of cyber security in Italy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuR21y2rrgI|work=YouTube|date=December 2012|language=Italian|format=Video Stream}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Hearing of the EECTF Chairman at the Chamber of Deputies of Italian Parliament on EECTF activities and trends of cyber security in Italy|url=http://documenti.camera.it/_dati/leg16/lavori/stencomm/09/indag/informatica/2012/1217/s000r.htm|work=Italian Chamber of Deputies website|date=December 2012|language=Italian|format=Stenographic Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Hearing of the EECTF Chairman at the Chamber of Deputies of Italian Parliament on EECTF activities and trends of cyber security in Italy|url=http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-5033ff3f-f355-482b-a7f5-0172e05e02a2-grp.html|work=Italian Parliament Web Radio|date=December 2012|language=Italian|format=Audio Streaming and Podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt; in cyber-crime and discuss methodologies and techniques to combat them.

== [[Governance]] ==

EECTF is not a legal entity, it’s a working group, created on a voluntary basis, which has been governed since its creation by the EECTF Board, made up of the three Founder Members: [[United States Secret Service]], represented by the [[Special Agent]] in Charge of the [[Rome]] Office, Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni, represented by the Head of Service and [[Poste Italiane]], represented by the CEO. &lt;br /&gt;
Poste Italiane has been chairing the EECTF Board since its birth. Chairman of the EECTF is Mr. Vanes Montanari, VP Security and Safety at [[Poste Italiane]].&lt;br /&gt;
Administrative and operational activities are accomplished by the EECTF Technical [[Secretariat (administrative office)|Secretariat]], held by [[Poste Italiane]].

== [[Modus Operandi]] ==

The EECTF is run via monthly meetings of a selected group of Permanent Members, quarterly open events extended to a wide Community of selected experts and continuous sharing of information relevant to the [[cybercrime]] scenario, also through dedicated specific tools. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Permanent Members are internationally acknowledged organizations, both [[Privately held company|private]] and [[Government-owned corporation|public]], with a broad view on prevention, analysis and contrast of electronic crimes at European level, whose competencies might represent instances coming from whole domains of interest.
&lt;br /&gt;
Permanent Members formally commit to [[proactive]]ly share information with other Members of the Group in a [[Competition (economics)|non-competitive]] environment, according to a [[non-disclosure agreement]], and to actively contribute to the EECTF life, taking part to meetings and supporting the EECTF development.
&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, in order to make the most out of the competencies of the whole community of the EECTF, an Expert Group has been started, which gather on a periodic basis and is restricted to only Permanent Members, focusing on technical information sharing about new [[Threat (computer)|threats]] and possible [[Countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]].

'''Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald''' (September 24, 1896&amp;nbsp;– December 21, 1940) was an American [[author of novels]] and [[short story writer|short stories]], whose works are the paradigmatic writings of the [[Jazz Age]]. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest [[American literature|American writer]]s of the 20th century. Fitzgerald is considered a member of the "[[Lost Generation]]" of the 1920s. He finished four novels: ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'', ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'', ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (his most famous), and ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'', was published posthumously. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that treat themes of youth and promise along with age and despair.

'''''For Boys Only: The Biggest, Baddest Book Ever''''' is a non-fiction book by Marc Aronson and [[HP Newquist]].

==Summary==
The book has 100 short articles on subjects that appeal to boys, such as biting spiders, [[Easter Island]], invisibility cloaks, and fake blood. It also includes a set of 39 codes for the reader to solve, which vary in difficulty.

==Reception==
A ''[[Booklist]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-33902645_ITM Booklist]&lt;/ref&gt; review stated that “In a tone both light and humorous, Newquist and Aronson aim to please by assembling a tantalizing assortment of codes, puzzles, best lists, brief history and science facts, instructions for fake blood and the ultimate Frisbee, and even advice about facing up to a shark (“try not to bleed too much”) . . . this offers lots of good fun, and with so much chick lit available, it’s nice to see special attention being paid to boys. In fact, there’s nothing here to keep girls away but the title.” 

A ''[[New York Times]]'' review says, "The overall problem with all this mountainous stuff, thunked helter-skelter into these boy books, whether Roarke’s Drift, Andrewsarchus Mongoliensis (a giant wolf-like animal that may have eaten beached whales), the invention of the juice-box (1980) or strategies for winning at rock-paper-scissors: It all cooks up into a saltless stew that won't offend the palates of kids or chickens".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/books/review/Rubin-t.html?ref=review The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also reviewed in ''[[School Library Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-34207637_ITM School Library Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frigg by Doepler.jpg|thumb|Frigg sits enthroned and facing the spear-wielding goddess [[Gná]], flanked by two goddesses, one of whom ([[Fulla]]) carries her ''eski'', a wooden box. Illustrated (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]].]]
In [[Germanic mythology]], '''Frigg''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|ɪ|g}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/frigg "Frigg"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Norse]]), '''Frija''' ([[Old High German]]), '''Frea''' ([[Langobardic language|Langobardic]]), and '''Frige''' ([[Old English]]) is a goddess. In nearly all sources, she is described as the wife of the god [[Odin]]. In Old High German and [[Old Norse]] sources, she is also connected with the goddess [[Fulla]]. The English weekday name [[Friday]] ([[etymology|etymologically]] Old English "Frīge's day") bears her name.

Frigg is described as a goddess associated with foresight and wisdom in [[Norse mythology]], the northernmost branch of Germanic mythology and most extensively attested. Frigg is the wife of the major god [[Odin]] and dwells in the wetland halls of [[Fensalir]], is famous for her [[Precognition|foreknowledge]], is associated with the goddesses Fulla, [[Lofn]], [[Hlín]], and [[Gná and Hófvarpnir|Gná]], and is ambiguously associated with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity [[Jörð]] (Old Norse "Earth"). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god [[Baldr]]. Due to the significant thematic overlap, scholars have proposed a particular connection to the goddess [[Freyja]].

After [[Christianization]], the mention of Frigg continued to occur in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. In modern times, Frigg has appeared in modern popular culture, has been the subject of art and receives modern veneration in [[Germanic Neopaganism]].

==Etymology, ''Friday'', and toponymy==
The [[theonym]]s ''Frigg'' (Old Norse) and ''Frija'' (Old High German) are [[cognate]] forms—linguistic siblings of the same origin—that descend from a substantivized feminine of [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''frijaz'' (via [[Holtzmann's law]]). *''frijaz'' descends from the same source ([[Proto-Indo-European]]) as the feminine [[Sanskrit]] noun ''priyā'' and the feminine [[Avestan]] noun ''fryā'' (both meaning "own, dear, beloved").{{sfnp|Orel|2003|p=114}} In the modern period, an [[Latin declension#First declension (a)|-a suffix]] is sometimes applied to denote femininity, resulting in the form ''Frigga''.&lt;ref name=ASUFFIX&gt;See for example {{harvp|Bulfinch|1913|p=344}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word ''[[Frig (interjection)|frig]]''.{{sfn|Sheard|2011|p=238}}

The connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess [[Freyja]] with Frigg in the [[Common Germanic deities|Proto-Germanic]] period ([[Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis]]) is a matter of scholarly debate.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56–66}} The name ''Freyja'' is not attested outside of [[Scandinavia]], like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the [[Vanir]]. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess ''Frigg'', who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] *''[[Frijjō]]''. Evidence does not exist for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse ''Freyja'' descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56–66}}

Regarding a Freyja–Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar [[Stephan Grundy]] comments that "the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-[[Viking Age]] references to [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddesses]], and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported."{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|p=57}}

The English [[weekday]] name ''[[Friday]]'' comes from Old English ''Frīġedæġ'', meaning 'day of Frige'. It is cognate with [[Old High German]] ''frîatac''.{{sfnp|Simek|2007|pp=93–94}} Several [[toponymy|place names]] refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.{{sfnp|Pulsiano|Wolf|1993|p=503}}

===''Origi Gentis Langobardorum'' and ''Historia Langobardorum''===
[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Godan and Frea look down from their window in the heavens to the Winnili women in an illustration by [[Emil Doepler]], 1905]]
[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster II by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Winnili women with their hair tied as beards look up at Godan and Frea in an illustration by Emil Doepler, 1905]]
The 7th-century ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'', and [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'' derived from it, recount a founding myth of the [[Langobards]], a Germanic people who ruled a region of what is now Italy (see [[Lombardy]]). According to this legend, a "small people" known as the ''[[Winnili]]'' were ruled by a woman named [[Gambara]] who had two sons, [[Ybor and Agio]]. The [[Vandals]], ruled by [[Ambri and Assi]], came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Agio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute. Ambra and Assi then asked the god Godan for victory over the Winnili, to which Godan responded (in the longer version in the ''Origo''): "Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory."{{sfnp|Foulke|2003|pp=315–16}}

Meanwhile, Ybor and Agio called upon Frea, Godan's wife. Frea counseled them that "at sunrise the Winnil[i] should come, and that their women, with their hair let down around the face in the likeness of a beard should also come with their husbands". At sunrise, Frea turned Godan's bed around to face east and woke him. Godan saw the Winnili, including their whiskered women, and asked "who are those Long-beards?" Frea responded to Godan, "As you have given them a name, give them also the victory". Godan did so, "so that they should defend themselves according to his counsel and obtain the victory". Thenceforth the Winnili were known as the ''Langobards'' ([[Lombardic language|Langobardic]] "long-beards").{{sfnp|Foulke|2003|pp=316–17}}

===Second Merseburg Incantation===
[[File:Wodan Heilt Balders Pferd by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|"Wodan Heals Balder's Horse" by Emil Doepler, 1905]]
A 10th-century manuscript found in what is now [[Merseburg]], Germany, features an invocation known as the [[Merseburg Incantations|Second Merseburg Incantation]]. The incantation calls upon various continental Germanic gods, including Old High German Frija and a goddess associated with her—[[Fulla|Volla]], to assist in healing a horse:

===''Poetic Edda''===
In the ''Poetic Edda'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, Frigg is mentioned in the poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Vafþrúðnismál]]'', the prose of ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Lokasenna]]'', and ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]''.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=305}}

Frigg receives three mentions in the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''Völuspá''. In the first mention, the poem recounts that Frigg wept for the death of her son [[Baldr]] in [[Fensalir]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=8}} Later in the poem, when the future death of Odin is foretold, Odin himself is referred to as the "beloved of Frigg" and his future death is referred to as the "second grief of Frigg".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=11}} Like  the reference to Frigg weeping in Fensalir earlier in the poem, the implied "first grief" is a reference to the grief she felt upon the death of her son, [[Baldr]].&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON-266"&gt;See, for example, {{harvp|Larrington|1999|p=266}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frigg and Odin in Grímnismál by Frølich.jpg|thumb|The goddess Frigg and her husband, the god Odin, sit in Hliðskjálf and gaze into "all worlds" and make a wager as described in ''Grímnismál'' in an illustration by [[Lorenz Frølich]], 1895]]
In the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', Frigg plays a prominent role. The prose introduction recounts that two sons of king [[Hrauðungr]], Agnar (age 10) and Geirröðr (age 8), once sailed out with a trailing line to catch small fish. However, wind drove them out into the ocean and, during the darkness of night, their boat wrecked. The brothers went ashore and there they met a [[Croft (land)|crofter]]. They stayed on the croft for one winter. During that winter, the couple separately fostered the two children: the old woman fostered Agnar and the old man fostered Geirröðr. Upon the arrival of spring, the old man brought them a ship. The old couple took the boys to the shore, and the old man took Geirröðr aside and spoke to him. The boys entered the boat and a breeze came.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}}

The boat returned to the harbor of their father. Geirröðr, forward in the ship, jumped to shore and pushed the boat, containing his brother, out and said "go where an evil spirit may get thee."{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=18}} Away went the ship and Geirröðr walked to a house, where he was greeted with joy; while the boys were gone, their father had died, and now Geirröðr was king. He "became a splendid man".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}} The scene switches to Odin and Frigg sitting in [[Hliðskjálf]], "look[ing] into [[Norse cosmology|all the worlds]]".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}} Odin says: "'Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is getting children a giantess [Old Norse ''[[gȳgi]]''] in a cave? while Geirröd, my foster son, is a king residing in his country.' Frigg answered, 'He is so inhospitable that he tortures his guests, if he thinks that too many come.'"{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=19}}

Odin replied that this was a great untruth and so the two made a wager. Frigg sent her "waiting-maid" [[Fulla]] to warn Geirröðr to be wary, lest a wizard who seeks him should harm him, and that he would know this wizard by the refusal of dogs, no matter how ferocious, to attack the stranger. While it was not true that Geirröðr was inhospitable with his guests, Geirröðr did as instructed and had the wizard arrested. Upon being questioned, the wizard, wearing a blue cloak, said no more than that his name is ''[[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]]''. Geirröðr has Grímnir tortured and sits him between two fires for 8 nights. Upon the 9th night, Grímnir is brought a full [[drinking horn]] by Geirröðr's son, Agnar (so named after Geirröðr's brother), and the poem continues without further mention or involvement of Frigg.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=19}}

In the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', where [[Loki]] accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity and/or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between the god Loki and the goddess Frigg (and thereafter between Loki and the goddess Freyja about Frigg). A prose introduction to the poem describes that numerous gods and goddesses attended a banquet held by [[Ægir]]. These gods and goddesses include Odin and, "his wife", Frigg.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=84}}

===''Prose Edda''===
Frigg is mentioned throughout the ''Poetic Edda'', compiled in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. Frigg is first mentioned in the ''Prose Edda'' [[Prologue (Prose Edda)]], wherein a [[Euhemerus|euhemerized]] account of the Norse gods is provided. The author describes Frigg as the wife of Odin, and, in a case of [[folk etymology]], the author attempts to associate the name ''Frigg'' with the Latin-influenced form ''Frigida''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=3}} The Prologue adds that both Frigg and Odin "had the gift of prophecy".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=3}}

In the next section of the ''Prose Edda'', ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] tells [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (the king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) that Frigg, daughter of [[Fjörgynn]] (Old Norse ''Fjörgynsdóttir'') is married to Odin and that the [[Æsir]] are descended from the couple, and adds that "the earth [''[[Jörð]]in''] was [Odin's] daughter and his wife".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=13}} According to High, the two had many sons, the first of which was the mighty god [[Thor]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=13}}

[[File:Frigg and Fulla 1874.jpg|thumb|Frigg reaches into a box presented to her by a handmaid, [[Ludwig Pietsch]], 1865]]
Later in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Gangleri asks about the ''[[ásynjur]]'', a term for Norse goddesses. High says that "highest" among them is Frigg and that only [[Freyja]] "is highest in rank next to her". Frigg dwells in [[Fensalir]] "and it is very splendid".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}} In this section of ''Gylfaginning'', Frigg is also mentioned in connection to other ''ásynjur'': [[Fulla]] carries Frigg's ashen box, "looks after her footwear and shares her secrets"; [[Lofn]] is given special permission by Frigg and Odin to "arrange unions" among men and women; [[Hlín]] is charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deems worthy of keeping from danger; and [[Gná and Hófvarpnir|Gná]] is sent by Frigg "into various worlds to carry out her business".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=29–30}}

In section 49 of ''Gylfaginning'', a narrative about the fate of Frigg's son Baldr is told. According to High, Baldr once started to have dreams indicating that his life was in danger. When Baldr told his fellow Æsir about his dreams, the gods met together for a [[thing (assembly)|thing]] and decided that they should "request immunity for Baldr from all kinds of danger". Frigg subsequently receives promises from the elements, the environment, diseases, animals, and stones, amongst other things. The request successful, the Æsir make sport of Baldr's newfound invincibility; shot or struck, Baldr remained unharmed. However, [[Loki]] discovers this and is not pleased by this turn of events, so, in the form of a woman, he goes to Frigg in Fensalir.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}}

There, Frigg asks this female visitor what the Æsir are up to assembled at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]]. The woman says that all of the Æsir are shooting at Baldr and yet he remains unharmed. Frigg explains that "Weapons and wood will not hurt Baldr. I have received oaths from them all."{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}} The woman asks Frigg if all things have sworn not to hurt Baldr, to which Frigg notes one exception; "there grows a shoot of a tree to the west of [[Valhalla|Val-hall]]. It is called [[mistletoe]]. It seemed young to me to demand the oath from."{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}} Loki immediately disappears.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}}

[[File:Baldr's Death by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Frigg grips her dead son, Baldr, in an illustration by Lorenz Frølich, 1895]]
Now armed with mistletoe, Loki arrives at the thing where the Æsir are assembled and tricks the blind [[Höðr]], Baldr's brother, into shooting Baldr with a mistletoe projectile. To the horror of the assembled gods, the mistletoe goes directly through Baldr, killing him. Standing in horror and shock, the gods are initially only able to weep due to their grief. Frigg speaks up and asks "who there was among the Æsir who wished to earn all her love and favour and was willing to ride the road to [[Hel (location)|Hel]] and try if he could find Baldr, and offer [[Hel (being)|Hel]] a ransom if she would let Baldr go back to Asgard".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=49}}

[[Hermóðr]], Baldr's brother, accepts Freyja's request and rides to Hel. Meanwhile, Baldr is given a grand funeral attended by many beings&amp;mdash;foremost mentioned of which are his mother and father, Frigg and Odin. During the funeral, [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] dies of grief and is placed in the funeral pyre with Baldr, her dead husband.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=49–50}} Hermóðr locates Baldr and Nanna in Hel. Hermodr secures an agreement for the return of Baldr and with Hermóðr Nanna sends gifts to Frigg (a linen robe) and Fulla (a finger-ring). Hermóðr rides back to the Æsir and tells them what has happened. However, the agreement fails due to the sabotage of a jötunn in a cave named [[Þökk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'), described perhaps Loki in disguise.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=50–51}}

Frigg is mentioned several times in the ''Prose Edda'' section ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]''. The first mention occurs at the beginning of the section, where the [[Æsir]] and Ásynjur are said to have once held a banquet in a hall in a land of gods, [[Asgard]]. Frigg is one of the twelve ásynjur in attendance.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=59}}

===''Heimskringla'' and sagas===
In ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', the first book of ''[[Heimskringla]]'', an [[Euhemerized]] account of the origin of the gods is provided. Frigg is mentioned once. According to the saga, while Odin was away, Odin's brothers [[Vili and Vé]] oversaw Odin's holdings. Once, while Odin was gone for an extended period, the Æsir concluded that he was not coming back. His brothers started to divvy up Odin's inheritance, "but his wife Frigg they shared between them. However, a short while afterwards, [Odin] returned and took possession of his wife again.{{sfnp|Hollander|2007|p=7}}

In ''[[Völsunga saga]]'', the great king [[Rerir]] and his wife (unnamed) are unable to conceive a child; "that lack displeased them both, and they fervently implored the gods that they might have a child. It is said that Frigg heard their prayers and told Odin what they asked".{{sfnp|Byock|1990|p=36}}

==Archaeological record==
A 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the [[Schleswig Cathedral]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Northern Germany]]. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a [[distaff]]. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.{{sfnp|Jones|Pennick|1995|pp=144–45}}

==Scholarly reception and interpretation==
{{main|Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis}}
Due to numerous similarities, some scholars have proposed that the Old Norse goddesses Frigg and [[Freyja]] descend from a common entity from the [[Proto-Germanic]] period.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}} Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar [[Stephan Grundy]] comments that "the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-[[Viking Age]] references to [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddesses]], and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported."{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|p=57}}

Unlike Frigg but like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the [[Vanir]], the name ''Freyja'' is not attested outside of [[Scandinavia]], as opposed to the name of the goddess ''Frigg'', who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''[[Frijjō]]''. Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which ''Freyja'' descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of evidence outside of the North Germanic record.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}}

==Modern influence==
Frigg is referenced in art and literature into the modern period. In the 18th century, [[Gustav III of Sweden]], king of Sweden, composed ''Friggja'', a play, so named after the goddess, and H. F. Block and [[Hans Friedrich Blunck]]'s ''Frau Frigg und Doktor Faust'' in 1937. Other examples include fine art works by K. Ehrenberg (''Frigg, Freyja'', drawing, 1883), [[John Charles Dollman]] (''Frigga Spinning the Clouds'', painting, c. 1900),  [[Emil Doepler]] (''Wodan und Frea am Himmelsfenster'', painting, 1901), and H. Thoma (''Fricka'', drawing, date not provided).{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=94}}

[[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] appears in [[Marvel Comics]] and in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as the queen of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wife of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], mother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and the adoptive mother of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. 

The Finnish folk band [[Frigg (band)|Frigg]] takes its name from the deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2012/09/finlands-frigg-uk-debut-tour/|title=Finland's 'Frigg' – UK Debut Tour – Folk Radio UK|date=27 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frigg.fi |title=Hot Fiddles from Cool Scandinavia |date= |accessdate=20 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412082933/http://www.frigg.fi/ |archivedate=12 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, on the initiative of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, the Archeological and Ethnographic Museum Complex under the open sky was established. Archaeological architectural monuments discovered on the Absheron Peninsula were collected and restored here. The mounds, settlements and other architectural monuments of the 3rd-2nd millennium BC were built in the same way as before the era.

Ancient mounds, grave stones, dwellings, quarries, places of worship and some other material cultural remains found in the territory of [[Absheron Peninsula]] reflect the mood of the previous millennia. One of the mound is called "Dubendi". The basis of this mound is the rug-shaped stone masonry.

Tools made from sheep bones and stone were found in the Reserve area. The "Turkan" mound also consists of a ring-shaped stonework. There is also a quadrilateral hole in this mound.

There are residues of water and food wells, coffee houses, ancient houses in the territory of the reserve. Archaeological excavations have been proven to be the Bronze Age settlement 5,000 years ago in the village of Gala.

'''Gordon Solie'''&lt;ref name="03article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news/1067284022.shtml|title=AS I SEE IT 10/28: Wrestling loses two of its best|first=Bob|last=Magee|date=October 27, 2003|publisher=WrestleView.com|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born '''Francis Jonard Labiak''',&lt;ref name=03article/&gt; later '''Jonard Pierre Sjoblom''',&lt;ref name=03article/&gt; January 26, 1929{{spaced ndash}}July 27, 2000), was an American [[Florida]]-based [[professional wrestling]] play-by-play announcer working for [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], USA Championship Wrestling, [[Continental Championship Wrestling]], and [[World Championship Wrestling]].

He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential wrestling announcers. [[Jim Ross]] cites him as the most significant influence on his career as an announcer.

==Professional wrestling career==
Originally from Minnesota, Solie moved to Tampa, Florida, in the 1950s after completing military service in the [[United States Air Force]]. Solie began his pro wrestling career as a ring announcer, making $5 a night emceeing weekly shows in the Tampa Bay area. He soon began working for Championship Wrestling from Florida, and in 1960, he moved into the broadcast booth to become the lead announcer for CWF's Saturday morning television shows, a spot he would occupy for the next quarter-century. During that time, he commentated on matches featuring some of pro wrestling's biggest legends, including WWE Hall of Famer [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], The Brisco Brothers and [[Dory Funk Jr]]., among numerous others. Solie rose to national prominence when [[Superstation WTBS]] began broadcasting pro wrestling, and the exposure helped him branch out, leading to Solie working for promotions in Georgia, Alabama and Puerto Rico.

Much of his fame stems from the gravelly sound of his voice calling the in-ring action and his unique lingo. He sometimes is incorrectly credited for originating the term "Pier-Six Brawl"&lt;ref&gt;However, the term appears in print as early as 1933: {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Risko is Victor over Levinsky in Ten Rounds |url= |work=Chicago Tribune |location= |date=25 February 1933 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a wild brawl, and was also notorious for noting when a bloodied superstar was "wearing the crimson mask." His oft-imitated signature call of a suplex as a "su-play." His signature sign-off was: "So long from the Sunshine State," followed by a wink.

In 1987, a board game, Gordon Solie's Championship Wrestling Trivia Game, was released by Sports Entertainment International, Inc.&lt;ref name="Board Game Geek"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135853/gordon-solies-championship-wrestling-trivia-game | title= Gordon Solie's Championship Wrestling Trivia Game| publisher=Board Game Geek| accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When CWF finally folded in 1987, Solie returned to Georgia and became one of the lead announcers for the NWA ([[National Wrestling Alliance]]) later [[WCW]] television programs. Solie also worked for the Continental Wrestling Federation and USA Championship Wrestling based out of Knoxville.  It was a natural transition for "The Dean," who had also been [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]]'s lead announcer before it became a subsidiary of NWA/WCW. He remained there until his eventual retirement in 1995. He was diagnosed with cancer soon after his retirement. In the late-1990s, his vocal chords were removed due to throat cancer. In July 2000, he died due to throat cancer at the age of 71, leaving behind five children.

In 2005, his posthumously released memoir ''Gordon Solie ... Something Left Behind'' became a best-seller. In 2008, he was inducted, by Jim Ross, into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], appearing on Solie's behalf were his five children; Pam, Danise, Jonard, Eric and Greg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/gordonsolie|title=Gordon Solie|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
On March 29, 2008, [[Jim Ross]] posthumously inducted Solie into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in the Class of 2008. Later the same year WWE's [[WWE Classics on Demand]] video service began offering ''The Film Room with Gordon Solie'', hosted by Ross, focusing on Solie's announcing and interviewing of a specific wrestler or group of wrestlers involved in a feud. On August 11, 2009 Solie's biography, '' The Solie Chronicles'' was released by Crowbar Press.

==Personal life==

===Death===
Solie's last announcing job was to be the [[Heroes of Wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] in 1999, but he could not attend due to failing health. He died of [[throat cancer]] on July 27, 2000. In 2005, Florida Media, Inc. published a collection of Solie's short stories and poetry in ''Gordon Solie ... Something Left Behind''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gordonsolie.com/2.html Profile], gordonsolie.com; accessed March 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert James Marella''' (June 4, 1937 – October 6, 1999), better known by his [[ring name]] of '''Gorilla Monsoon''', was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], [[Sports commentator|play-by-play commentator]], and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]].

Monsoon is famous for his run as a super-heavyweight main eventer, and later as the voice of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], as commentator and backstage manager during the 1980s and 1990s. He also portrayed the on-screen role of WWF President from 1995 to 1997.

In professional wrestling, the staging area just behind the entrance curtain at an event, a position which Marella established and where he could often be found during WWF shows late in his career, is named the "Gorilla Position" in his honor. Although remembered fondly by many viewers, Monsoon was voted [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Worst Television Announcer|Worst Television Announcer]] a record six times by readers of the ''[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' in the publication's annual awards poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/wrestling/blog/2007/11/more_of_the_best_and_worst_wrestling_announcers.html|title=More of the best and worst wrestling announcers|last=Eck|first=Kevin|date=November 29, 2007|website=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|access-date=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Amateur career===
Marella attended [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Rochester, New York)|Jefferson High School]] in [[Rochester, New York]], becoming a standout athlete in [[American football|football]], [[Scholastic wrestling|amateur wrestling]], and [[track and field]]. At the time, he weighed over 300 pounds (136&amp;nbsp;kg), and was affectionately called "Tiny" by his teammates.

Marella was also a standout athlete after [[high school]] at [[Ithaca College]] in [[Ithaca, New York]]. He continued to wrestle, now weighing over 350 pounds, and took second in the 1959 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Wrestling Championships. He also held several school athletic records, including an 18-second wrestling pin, and several track-and-field distinctions. He was inducted into the Ithaca College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1973.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Legends|last=Solomon|first=Brian|pages=57–61|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7434-9033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summers he was at Ithaca College, he was a construction worker in Rochester. One of the buildings he helped construct was the [[Rochester War Memorial Arena]]. He was inducted into the Section V Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2010 along with longtime childhood friend Frank Marotta who gave a speech on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://armdrag.com/hof/ |title=Section V Wrestling Hall of Fame |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marella's size and athletic ability attracted the attention of New York promoter Pedro Martinez, and he went to wrestle for Martinez after graduating from Ithaca in 1959. Gorilla was 6'2" and weighed around 330 pounds when he first started wrestling professionally. By the end of his career he was up around 375 pounds, although he had weighed as much as 440 pounds at points.

===Early career===
Marella originally billed himself as Gino Marella,&lt;ref name=wwebio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/gorillamonsoon |title=Gorilla Monsoon's Hall of Fame profile |publisher=[[WWE]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a proud [[Italian American]] [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] who would sing in Italian prior to his matches. Even after changing his [[ring name]], "Gino" stuck as Marella's nickname among friends and colleagues, including [[Jesse Ventura]], who would call Marella "Gino" on the air. Marella garnered moderate popularity, but soon realized that fans paid more attention to outlandish monster [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmicks]], and they therefore made more money. Marella totally revamped his image, growing a long beard and billing himself as Gorilla Monsoon, a terrifying giant from [[Manchuria]]. Supposedly born on an isolated farm, "Monsoon" traveled across the countryside with a gypsy caravan wrestling bears, spoke no English, ate raw meat, and drank his victims' blood. The story given on WWWF television was a bit different: his first manager, Bobby Davis, claimed to have discovered Monsoon in Manchuria wading nude in a mountain stream. The Monsoon character was far more successful, and fans were genuinely afraid of him, sparking a huge financial windfall for Marella. In the ring, Monsoon dominated opponents with vicious chops, the dreaded Manchurian Splash, and his signature move, the Airplane Spin.

Marella first wrestled [[Bruno Sammartino]] for the WWWF World Championship on October 4, 1963, at Roosevelt Stadium, in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] Monsoon qualified by winning a partially televised Ring Wrestling Magazine tournament, where he pinned Killer Buddy Austin in about a minute.
Monsoon's disqualification win over Sammartino in NJ triggered a series of rematches at [[Madison Square Garden]], and they would renew the feud again there in 1967. At the end of the Jersey City match as Monsoon was sitting on the mat a fan (not part of the show) jumped into the ring and broke the back of a wooden chair over Monsoon's head.

===WWWF/WWF career===
In 1963, [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vincent J. McMahon]] reformed the Capitol Wrestling Corporation into the ''World Wide Wrestling Federation'' (WWWF) (currently known as [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]), breaking his territory away from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in an attempt to create a new national powerhouse. At the time, the WWWF was the dominant wrestling promotion in the Northeast U.S. Marella formed a friendship with McMahon, and became a 1/6 shareholder in the WWWF, controlling bookings in several WWWF territories. He also became one of the promotion's top heels, feuding with popular babyface champion [[Bruno Sammartino]] in sellout arenas across the country. Despite his huge size, then in excess of 400 pounds, Monsoon had great agility and stamina, often wrestling Sammartino to one-hour time-limit draws.

Monsoon teamed up with [[Killer Kowalski]] with success. In November 1963, they defeated [[Skull Murphy]] and [[Brute Bernard]] to win the [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship|U.S. Tag Team Championship]]. The following month, the duo lost the belts to the Tolos Brothers (Chris and John) in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; Monsoon and Kowalski reunited in the late 1960s to defeat champion Bruno Sammartino and [[Víctor Rivera (professional wrestler)|Victor Rivera]] 2 falls to 1 in Madison Square Garden in a main event, marking the first, and possibly only time, that Sammartino &amp; Rivera lost as a tag team.

Monsoon also teamed with [[Professor Tanaka|Professor Toru Tanaka]], and they had a number of tag matches in Madison Square Garden.
They won a main event on disqualification over Sammartino and [[Spiros Arion]] and later lost a Texas Death rematch to the same team.
A year later, after defeating teams such as [[Al Costello]] &amp; [[Dr. Bill Miller]] and [[Bobo Brazil]] and [[Earl Maynard]], they went on
to lose a main event to Sammartino and Victor Rivera. Monsoon had semi main event matches with Spyros Arion as well as Bobo Brazil in his key heel years.

In 1969, Monsoon became a babyface, befriending his former arch-rival when Sammartino rescued him from an attack by "Crazy" [[Luke Graham (wrestler)|Luke Graham]]. The stage was set for Monsoon to become a fan favorite of the 1970s and feud with top heels of the decade, including champion [[Superstar Billy Graham]]. He turned heel for a short time in 1977 and feuded with [[André the Giant]], and the two engaged in a special [[boxing]] match in [[Puerto Rico]] (where Monsoon owned stock in the territory), with André winning the match.

As a face, he had major wins in Madison Square Garden, including over Killer Kowalski as well as [[Ernie Ladd|"Big Cat" Ernie Ladd]].

On June 2, 1976, a very famous incident occurred in [[Philadelphia]] involving boxing great [[Muhammad Ali]]. Ali, preparing for his upcoming crossover bout with [[Antonio Inoki]] in Japan later that month, jumped into the ring as Monsoon was concluding a short match against Baron [[Mikel Scicluna]] that was being taped for the syndicated WWWF TV show. Ali removed his shirt and started dancing around Monsoon while gesturing and throwing jabs at him, to which Monsoon responded by grabbing Ali in his Airplane Spin and slamming him to the mat. Marella would never reveal whether the incident was preplanned. In an interview, he commented, "I never saw him before and haven't seen him since."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ithaca.edu/icq/1999v4/ssgoril.htm |title=Farewell to Wrestler Gorilla Monsoon |publisher=Ithaca College Quarterly 1999/No. 4 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A kind of torch bearer of the Vincent J. McMahon-era WWWF, Gorilla Monsoon was rabidly supported by New York audiences. On June 16, 1980, a young and up-and-coming [[Hulk Hogan]] was booked to face him at [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Hogan was a widely followed heel character, while Monsoon was still a babyface. However, in order to push the new talent, McMahon told Hulk Hogan to beat Monsoon in under a minute. Upon that outcome, the crowd became livid and chased Hogan when he was leaving the arena, turning over his car. Policemen on horses had to be summoned to quiet the mob.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

As the 1980s began, Marella's in-ring career wound down. On August 23, Monsoon put his career on the line in a match against [[Ken Patera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: Vol. 1: WWF 1963–1989|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=310|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsoon lost the match and stayed true to his word, retiring several weeks later and returning just four times: wrestling a match in 1982 as a substitute for André the Giant, taking part in [[Big John Studd]]'s "Body Slam Challenge" in 1983, a six-man tag team match at Madison Square Garden, and participating in a special "old timers" [[Professional wrestling battle royal|battle royal]] in 1987 which was won by [[Lou Thesz]]. The next phase of his career began, as the voice and backstage manager of WWF.

====After in-ring retirement====
In the early 1980s, Vincent J. McMahon's son, [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]], began assuming the reins of the promotion from his father. The elder McMahon asked his son to take care of long-time employees that had been loyal to him. The younger McMahon agreed, and in 1982, Vince bought Marella's shares in the company in exchange for a guarantee of lifetime employment. As he had been to his father, Marella became a close confidant of the younger McMahon, and assumed a prominent backstage role within the then WWF. Marella would then become an announcer for the WWF starting in 1982. In addition, McMahon needed a new commentary team to head up his television programming, and installed Marella with the recently retired [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]] in 1985.

Marella and Ventura had great chemistry, with Ventura as the pro-heel color commentator and Marella as the pro-face "voice of reason". Marella and Ventura called five of the first six [[WrestleMania]]s together (the notable exception was [[WrestleMania 2]], where Marella commentated on the [[Allstate Arena|Chicago]] portion of the event with [[Gene Okerlund]], [[Cathy Lee Crosby]] and [[Ernie Ladd|Ernie "The Cat" Ladd]] while Ventura commentated on the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Los Angeles]] portion with [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]] and [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira, Mistress of the Dark]]).

The Ventura/Monsoon duo of heel and babyface were the original broadcast duo, setting the standard which all who followed would attempt to emulate, especially Ventura's charismatic pro-heel character which was a first of its kind as previous wrestling commentators had almost always been in favor of the fan favorites. The pair commentated on all the [[WWF pay-per-view]]s together with the exception of the first two [[SummerSlam]]s and the [[Royal Rumble (1990)|1990 Royal Rumble]] (at [[SummerSlam (1988)|SummerSlam 1988]] Ventura was the guest referee for the main event so Monsoon commentated with "Superstar" Billy Graham, while Ventura was paired with [[Tony Schiavone]] at both [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam 1989]] and the Royal Rumble). When Ventura left the WWF in mid-1990, he was replaced in commentary by Monsoon's ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]]'' co-host, heel manager [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]], another duo that subsequent wrestling commentary teams have often tried to emulate. The two also formed a close real-life friendship which Heenan often recalled fondly. In his [[WWE Hall of Fame]] induction speech at the [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|2004 ceremony]], Heenan finished by saying that only one thing was missing – that he wished Monsoon was there. Other people who were often paired with Monsoon in the broadcast booth included Lord Alfred Hayes, [[Johnny Polo]], [[Billy Graham (wrestler)|"Superstar" Billy Graham]], [[Hillbilly Jim]], [[Tony Schiavone]], [[Jim Neidhart]], [[Randy Savage]] and [[Jim Ross]].

Monsoon called the first eight WrestleManias from 1985 to 1992. Monsoon was the lead commentator on the syndicated show, ''[[List of former WWE programming#All-Star Wrestling (1970–1986)|WWF All Star Wrestling]]'', its successor ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'', and the [[USA Network]] weekend show, ''[[List of former WWE programming#All American Wrestling (1983–1994)|WWF All American Wrestling]]'', as well as hosting the WWF weeknight show, ''Prime Time Wrestling''. Monsoon also served as co-host of ''[[Georgia Championship Wrestling]]'' on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|WTBS]] during McMahon's short-lived ownership of the promotion.

====Commentating style====
As a [[Sports commentator|play-by-play]] commentator, Monsoon's colorful announcing style proved a perfect fit for the character-based WWF while, at the same time, maintaining the sporting aspect of pro wrestling. Not only would Monsoon call holds but he consistently brought up the athletic competition frequently mentioning his and Jesse's wrestling backgrounds and drawing on that, saying on occasion that he was "glad [he] had retired" (after a particularly devastating move during a match he was commentating). Gorilla would also mention the "winners and losers purse" when it came to match decisions. Monsoon accentuated the storylines surrounding the bouts while relying on [[hyperbole]], deadpan humor and unique catchphrases. One such phrase was his ironic use of the word "literally", such as "the [[Madison Square Garden|Garden]] just literally exploded!" Nearly every venue was described, at the start of the broadcast, as "Jam packed to the rafters", even events in a roofless location. Another popular catchphrase was, "...and a beauty!", which would usually follow a well-executed wrestling move (such as "[A] clothesline, and a beauty!"). On the other hand if Monsoon would see a poorly executed move he would quip "not but behind it".

Another of Monsoon's phrases was "Will you stop?" This was usually directed, in frustration, at co-commentator Bobby Heenan after he went off on one of his many heel-backing tangents or other rants. Monsoon also used "will you stop" when either Ventura, Heenan or any other heels he was commentating with would mention what a bad job referee Joey Marella was doing, the joke being that Marella was Monsoon's real life adopted son, a fact not well known among wrestling fans at the time.

Another classic Monsoon comment regularly heard just after he would sign on for an important event was, "Pandemonium is running wild! The electricity in here is so thick that you can cut it with a knife!" Another was "This place has gone bananas!", which was preceded by an event in which the audience had erupted in cheers or jeers, such as the entrance of a wrestler or the finish of a match. Many times, Monsoon would also substitute simple words with needlessly complex and obscure equivalents – for example, he memorably used "[[external occipital protuberance]]" as an alternative to "back of the head." Or when a wrestler suffered a knee injury, he would state, "He may have temporarily dislocated the patella!" Heenan mocked this, once sarcastically calling a move to the "cervial dervial part of the back." However, Monsoon also employed several homegrown substitutes for body part terminology – for example, describing the mouth as a "kisser" and the abdomen as "the bread basket." When a wrestler put his finishing hold/maneuver on a jobber, he would say "Get the (hot) shower ready, this one is history!" or "Stick the fork in (losing wrestler), he's done!". While commentating a match where a title changes hands, Monsoon might declare "History has been made!" When discussing something he didn't believe would happen, he would say "highly unlikely." If a babyface wrestler was attacked from behind or by surprise, he would refer to it as a "[[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] Job." When a babyface wrestler used an illegal tactic on a heel wrestler that was used on the babyface earlier in the match, Monsoon would state "What's good for the goose is good for the gander." Also, when a wrestler or tag team (usually the face) lost a match through illegal tactics (such as being hit with [[Jimmy Hart|"The Mouth of the South" Jimmy Hart]]'s megaphone), Monsoon would often proclaim that there had been a "miscarriage of justice". Monsoon generally put more emphasis on this when the heel(s) won a championship match, or retained their title(s). When referring to the heel managers/on screen personalities ([[Bobby Heenan]], [[Johnny Valiant|Luscious Johnny V]], [[Jimmy Hart]], [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]], etc.), he would refer to them as "That fountain of misinformation" "a walking advertisement for birth control" or "That piece of garbage".

When speaking to and/or about someone's lack of presence at some event, he would often remark that they were "conspicuous by their absence." Other common phrases used were "listen to the ovation for (name of wrestler)" as a fan-favorite made his way to the ring and "take a look at (name of wrestler)" to highlight the impressiveness of a wrestler. Finally, during encounters between two super-heavyweights, Monsoon sometimes described the match as "the irresistible force meeting the immovable object." This phrase became most well-known after being used to promote the match between [[André the Giant]] and [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[WrestleMania III]]. During matches which involved heavyweight wrestlers such as André the Giant, [[King Kong Bundy]] or the [[One Man Gang]], Jesse Ventura would often reference Marella's own wrestling weight by asking him what he weighed at his heaviest, with Marella often replying "440" ({{convert|440|lb|kg|abbr=on}}), and that he could easily wrestle for an hour at that weight. Ventura would then usually ask where he got weighed to which the reply was usually that he would go to the truck weighbridges located on the interstate.

====Later career====
Marella stepped down as the WWF's lead commentator at [[WrestleMania IX]] (where he was Master of Ceremonies) to make way for [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] recruit [[Jim Ross]]. He was phased out of ''Wrestling Challenge'' with Bobby Heenan and was moved to ''All-American Wrestling'' with [[Lord Alfred Hayes]] on April 11, 1993. He commentated with Jim Ross on WWF Radio for the broadcasts of [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam 1993]], [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series 1993]] and [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble 1994]]. He returned to the television broadcast team to call the [[King of the Ring (1994)|King of the Ring 1994]] with [[Randy Savage]] as well as covering a few episodes of ''[[Monday Night RAW]]'' in 1993 and 1994 whenever Vince McMahon was unavailable. He was also called upon sporadically to return to ''Challenge'' from 1993 to 1995, calling action with [[Stan Lane]], [[Ted DiBiase]], and Ross again. Monsoon also did various work for [[Coliseum Video]]. Marella's last pay-per-view commentary was for the [[Survivor Series (1994)|1994 Survivor Series]], with Vince McMahon on play-by-play. Marella remained in his backstage role and appeared on-air frequently, becoming the storyline WWF President in the summer of 1995 (replacing [[Jack Tunney]]). The WWF President's role was to arbitrate disputes between wrestlers and make matches, similar to the current WWE general managers. It was during this time that, after he was attacked and ([[kayfabe]]) severely injured by [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], that [[Roddy Piper]] became interim WWF President until [[WrestleMania XII]], when Marella assumed the position again. Health concerns forced him to relinquish this role during the summer of 1997. Instead of naming a replacement, the WWF decided to retire the role of "President" and introduced [[Sgt. Slaughter]] as the new WWF Commissioner in August 1997. Marella's health deteriorated from there. In late 1998, Marella returned briefly to call the international version of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''. In 1999, Marella appeared in a WWF Attitude commercial featuring [[Freddie Blassie]], [[Ernie Ladd]], [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] and [[Killer Kowalski]]. His final appearance on WWF television before his death was as one of the three judges for a ''[[WWF Brawl for All|Brawl for All]]'' contest between [[Mike Plotcheck|Bart Gunn]] and [[Eric Esch|Butterbean]] at [[WrestleMania XV]]. Because of his frail appearance and rapidly declining health, the camera only focused on Monsoon during his introduction as a judge, for which he received a standing ovation.

==Personal life==
Marella was married to his wife, Maureen, for more than 40 years and had three children: Sharon (born 1960), [[Joey Marella|Joey]] (adopted, 1963–1994), and Valerie (born 1966).[[Victor Quinones]] (1959-2006) was listed in Gorilla's obituary as his son as well. This was never confirmed officially by Gorilla but the Marella family has acknowledged this after Gorilla's death.&lt;ref&gt;http://wrestlingclassics.com/cgi-bin/.ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=1&amp;t=157123#000011&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Linda McMahon]], Marella was considered as a possible replacement for [[Vince McMahon]] as the owner of the WWF if McMahon had been found guilty during his 1994 legal trial for illegal steroid use in the company.

On July 4, 1994, his adopted son, Joey Marella, fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], while returning from refereeing a WWF event in [[Ocean City, Maryland]]. He was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.

For years, Marella had a custom New Jersey license plate which read "[[kayfabe]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Death and legacy==
Marella died on October 6, 1999, of [[heart failure]] brought on by complications of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], at his home in [[Willingboro Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/1999-10-07/news/25507679_1_killer-kowalski-santa-claus-ithaca-college |title=Robert Marella, 62, Wrestler Known As 'Gorilla Monsoon' |author=S. Joseph Hagenmayer |publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=October 7, 1999 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 November 2013 |quote=Robert "Gorilla Monsoon" Marella, 62, a professional wrestler whose demeanor in the ring resembled Atilla the Hun's but whose deeds and personality were more akin to those of Santa Claus, died yesterday at his Willingboro home after being ill for the last month.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 62 years old. In a tribute that aired on October 11, 1999, on an episode of ''[[Raw Is War]]'' from the [[Georgia Dome]], McMahon described Marella as "one of the greatest men I have ever known."

He is interred next to his son, Joey Marella, at Lakeview Memorial Park in [[Cinnaminson, New Jersey]].

WCW commentator [[Tony Schiavone]] acknowledged Marella's death on the October 11, 1999, episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''. Bobby Heenan insisted on doing a tribute to Marella, even though Marella never worked for WCW. Heenan said on-air: "Gorilla will be sadly missed. Now he was one big tough man. He was a decent honest man. And we're all gonna miss him very much. And you know the pearly gates in heaven? It's now gonna be called 'the Gorilla position.' Goodbye, my friend."

Robert Marella was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]], [[WWE Hall of Fame (1994)|class of 1994]], on June 9.

When Heenan was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2004, he ended his acceptance speech with a very emotional, "There's only one thing missing, I wish Monsoon was here."

In 2007, when [[Santino Marella|Anthony Carelli]] made his debut with WWE, as a tribute to Marella, he was given the ring name "Santino Marella".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5111">The '''Grojanowski Report''' is an eye-witness account about atrocities in the German [[Chełmno extermination camp]], written in 1942 by [[Polish-Jewish]] escapee from the camp, [[Szlama Ber Winer]] (also known incorrectly as Szlawek Bajler), under the pseudonym of Yakov (or Jacob) Grojanowski.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathcamps.org/occupation/bajler.html |title=Szlamek Bajler |publisher=DeathCamps.org |year=2014 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szlama Ber Winer managed to make his way from Chelmno to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and gave detailed information about his week-long experience with the ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' at that [[death camp]] to the Ghetto's [[Oyneg Shabbos (group)|Oneg Shabbat]] group, headed by historian [[Emanuel Ringelblum]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Heberer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VDjBDgUBWYgC&amp;pg=PA183 Children During the Holocaust] (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon E. Lewis, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3MpKC9mANP8C&amp;pg=PT101 Voices from the Holocaust]'' page 248, [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report contents==
Winer described the entire extermination procedure at the camp, how people were murdered in [[gas vans]], how their corpses were removed by the forest commando, how the inside of the vans was cleaned between loads, and how the bodies were buried in large mass graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNHxkOF5u4A |first=Alan |last=Heath |title=Chelmno Waldlager |publisher=Youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winer wrote:

{{quote|We didn’t have to wait long before the next lorry arrived with fresh victims. It was specially constructed. It looked like a normal large lorry, in grey paint, with two hermetically closed rear doors. The inner walls were of steel metal. There weren’t any seats. The floor was covered by a wooden grating, as in public baths, with straw mats on top. Between the driver’s cab and the rear part were two peepholes. With a flashlight one could observe through these peepholes if the victims were already dead. Under the wooden grating were two tubes about {{convert|15|cm}} thick which came out of the cab. The tubes had small openings from which gas poured out. The gas generator was in the cab, where the same driver sat all the time. He wore a uniform of the [[SS death’s head]] units and was about forty years old. There were two such vans.&lt;br&gt;{{space|5}}When the lorries approached we had to stand at a distance of 5 m from the ditch.

Winer also described the brutal treatment of '' Sonderkommando'' prisoners, left alive to dispose of the corpses, and his escape from the camp.&lt;ref&gt;Łucja Pawlicka-Nowak, ''Chelmno Witnesses Speak'', Koło.&lt;/ref&gt; Oneg Shabbat group and Winer then copied the report in both Polish and German; they sent the Polish version to the [[Polish Underground State]], while the German copy was meant for the German people, in the hope it would evoke their compassion for the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motlc.learningcenter.wiesenthal.org/text/x06/xm0619.html Wiesenthal Center]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206317.pdf |title=Grojanowski Report, Yad Vashem |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org.il/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205915.pdf |title=Chelmno, Yad Vashem |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear what was done with the reports at that point.

Winer subsequently escaped to [[Zamość]] where he wrote to the Warsaw Ghetto of the existence of a death camp in [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringelblum archive, Warsaw&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days after writing this letter, towards the end of April 1942, he was rounded up, deported and gassed at Bełżec.&lt;ref name=gil&gt;Gilbert, Martin.

'''Jenkins v NZI Finance Ltd''' (1991) 3 NZBLC 102,198 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding that the common law remedy of [[non est factum]] for a contract is not available simply because a party was careless in signing a contract without first properly reading it.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Mr Jenkins was a director of several companies company, mainly involved in the electrical fields, with the biggest contract involving the expansion of the [[Glenbrook Steel Mill|Glenbrook steel mill]].

As a result of a dispute over $3.86 million of the Glenbrook contract, these companies experienced cashflow difficulties, and to resolve this, Jenkins started discussions with NZI to increase its revolving credit facility from $500,000 to $800,000.

However, due to the financial position of the companies, NZI required additional security for the increase in the credit facility, namely a mortgage over their jointly owned Hamilton matrimonial home.

Mrs Jenkins had an appointment at 2.30pm with her husband's solicitor, although the lawyer was at least 25 minutes late. She also had a later appointment to see her son at 3.30 - 3.45.

As she was short in time, and in a hurry to make the later appointment, she signed the mortgage documents, without first referring them to her solicitor for legal advice.

Later, the companies were placed into receivership, and the bank sought to enforce the mortgage security over her home.

Mrs Jenkins claimed the mortgage was unenforceable, pleading [[non est factum]] as she did not take legal advice before signing the mortgage documents, and did not realize the nature of the mortgage.

==Held==
The court dismissed the non est factum plea, as she was not misled into signing the mortgage documents, but instead she was careless in signing them.

'''Kyöpelinvuori''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]  from kyöpeli = obsolete word for ghost and vuori = mountain), in [[Finnish mythology]], is the place which dead women [[haunting|haunt]]. It is rumoured that [[virgin]]s who die young gather there after their [[death]] at the start of their [[afterlife]]. It corresponds to [[Blockula]] (in modern Swedish ''Blåkulla'') of Swedish mythology. 

Kyöpelinvuori is also well known in Finland due to [[Easter]]: it is said to be the ancient home of mountain [[witch]]es who fly on [[broom]]s with [[black cat]]s. The witches leave the area only during Easter in order to spook children. These witches have also been humorously referred to be spinsters who will end up there in order to escape from the "old maid" tax.

According to the [[National Land Survey of Finland]], there is a total number of 32 Kyöpelinvuori hills in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kansalaisen.karttapaikka.fi/kartanhaku/paikannimihaku.html?query=hae&amp;hakutapa=paikannimihaku&amp;nimi=Ky%C3%B6pelinvuori&amp;kunta=&amp;e=406643&amp;n=7195132&amp;scale=8000000&amp;tool=siirra&amp;styles=normal&amp;lang=fi Kyöpelinvuori] Kansalaisen karttapaikka.

The prefix 'U' is used for [[Russia]] and all the former Soviet republics except [[Moldova]] (LU), [[Estonia]] (EE), [[Latvia]] (EV), and [[Lithuania]] (EY). Each former Soviet republic or group of them is assigned a 2-character (Ux) prefix, and Russia has 10 prefixes. The only exception is the prefix UM, which, while used for Belarus airports, is also used for a single airport (UMKK) in Russia (in the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] [[exclave]]). For this reason, there is a [[#UM|UM second-level section]] under Russia as well as the first level section [[#UM – Belarus|UM&amp;nbsp;– Belarus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37958">[[Image:McMillan Plan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[National Mall]] was the centerpiece of the McMillan Plan.]]
The '''McMillan Plan''' (formally titled '''The Report of the Senate Park Commission. The Improvement of the Park System of the District of Columbia''') is a [[comprehensive planning]] document for the development of the monumental core and the park system of [[Washington, D.C.]], the capital of the United States. It was written in 1902 by the [[Senate Park Commission]]. The commission is popularly known as the McMillan Commission after its chairman, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]] of [[Michigan]].{{sfn|Tompkins|1993|page=xvii}}

The McMillan Plan proposed eliminating the Victorian landscaping of the [[National Mall]] and replacing it with a simple expanse of grass, narrowing the Mall, and permitting the construction of low, [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] museums and cultural centers along the Mall's east–west axis. The plan proposed constructing major memorials on the western and southern anchors of the Mall's two axes, reflecting pools on the southern and western ends, and massive granite and marble terraces and arcades around the base of the [[Washington Monument]]. The plan also proposed tearing down the existing railroad passenger station on the National Mall and constructing a large new station north of the [[United States Capitol]] building.

Additionally, the McMillan Plan contemplated the construction of clusters of tall, Neoclassical office buildings around [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] and the Capitol building, as well as an extensive system of neighborhood parks and recreational facilities throughout the city. Major new [[parkways]] would connect these parks as well as link the city to nearby attractions.

Never formally adopted by the United States government, the McMillan Plan was implemented piecemeal in the decades after its release. The location of the [[Lincoln Memorial]], [[Ulysses S. Grant Memorial]], [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]], and [[Jamie L. Whitten Building|U.S. Department of Agriculture Building]] are due to the McMillan Plan. Proposals to construct [[Arlington Memorial Bridge]] received a major boost from the plan as well. The McMillan Plan continues to guide urban planning in and around Washington, D.C., into the 21st century, and has become a part of the federal government's official planning policy for the national capital.

==Senate Park Commission==
[[File:James McMillan.jpg|thumb|left|Senator James McMillan, sponsor of legislation that created the Senate Park Commission.]]
Beginning around 1880, a series of articles appeared in the local D.C. and national press which were highly critical of the mediocre architecture and poor-quality public spaces and accommodations in the District of Columbia. In addition, a highly influential meeting of the [[American Institute of Architects]] was held in Washington in December 1900, during which not only were the city's shortcomings extensively discussed but plans proposed for rectifying them.{{sfn|Kohler|2006|page=xi}} The plan presented at that meeting by Washington-based architect [[Paul J. Pelz]] anticipates several decisions in the eventual McMillan Plan, including the grouping of [[Congressional office buildings]] around the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], the development of [[Federal Triangle]], and the location of the [[National Archives Building]].{{sfn|Wrenn|1996|pages=60-65}}

The Senate Park Commission was formed by the [[United States Senate]] on March 8, 1901, to reconcile competing visions for the development of Washington, D.C., and especially the National Mall and nearby areas.{{sfn|Peterson|2003|pages=78-91}} McMillan Commission members included architect [[Daniel Burnham]], [[landscape architect]] [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]], and architect [[Charles F. McKim]].{{sfn|Thomas|2002|page=16}} [[Charles Moore (businessman)|Charles Moore]], Senator McMillan's chief aide, became secretary of the commission. Sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] joined the commission as its last member in August 1901 at the suggestion of McKim.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|pages=15-16}}

The commission members (excluding Saint-Gaudens, who was ill with cancer){{sfn|Rybczynski|2008|page=61}} and Moore departed for Europe on June 13, 1901, to tour the continent's great manor homes, gardens, and urban landscapes. By the time the commission returned to the United States on August 1, Moore had become a ''de facto'' member of the commission.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|pages=20-21}}

==Description of the plan==
The commission sponsored a major exhibit about their proposals at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] on January 15, 1902, the same day the report was released to the public.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|page=27}} President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] attended the exhibit's opening. The exhibit was dominated by two vast models of the District of Columbia, one showing it as it existed in 1901 and the other showing the changes proposed by the Senate Park Commission.
{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|page=132}}

Seventy-one of the report's pages discussed proposals for the National Mall, while the remaining 100 pages discussed improvements for the park system in and around the city.{{sfn|Kohler|2006|page=xii}} The proposals for the National Mall received the greatest attention from the commission, and were the most detailed.{{sfn|Gillette|1995|page=100}} The proposals for the city's parks, beaches, and recreational facilities (ostensibly the reason for its existence) were treated in more general ways.{{sfn|Davis|2008|page=176, fn. 2}} Scattered throughout the plan were references to streets, boulevards, parkways, and various other connections between District and regional parks and the District and the surrounding cities and undeveloped areas.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|page=133}}

===The National Mall and the "monumental core"===
[[File:National Mall circa 1900 - Washington DC.jpg|thumb|350px|The McMillan Plan successfully proposed eliminating National Mall's Victorian-era landscape design (shown here circa 1900).]]
The report proposed turning the National Mall into the core of the growing city. A cruciform design for the Mall was proposed.  The [[United States Capitol]] building anchored the east end of the east–west axis, and the [[White House]] the north end of the north–south axis. In the center was the Washington Monument. The recently completed [[West Potomac Park]] would be the anchor for the west end of the east–west axis. The commission suggested the recently authorized Lincoln Memorial be sited in the park, while proposing that the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial be moved to a new plaza to be constructed directly west of the Capitol. The recently created [[East Potomac Park]] would anchor the southern end of the north–south axis, and be occupied by a vast complex of recreational facilities ("Washington Commons") as well as a possible new memorial (to the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] or great inventors, the report suggested). [[Andrew Jackson Downing]]'s winding Victorian landscape design on the National Mall would be replaced with an open vista of grass flanked by formal rows of trees similar to the landscape design at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] and the [[Palace of Versailles]] in France. The width of the Mall, determined after extensive on-site measurements, would be narrowed to just {{convert|300|ft|m}}. The north and south sides of the National Mall were to be lined with low public office buildings, museums, and cultural attractions (such as theaters).  The plan also suggested constructing a low, [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] bridge linking West Potomac Park with [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Around the base of the Washington Monument, new formal gardens and terraces would help to frame the base of the monument. The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station|Baltimore &amp; Potomac (B&amp;P) Railroad Passenger Terminal]], located on the National Mall at what is today New Jersey Avenue NW and [[Constitution Avenue]] NW, would be torn down and a new, modern train station with a grand court and massive passenger waiting and service areas would be constructed north of the Capitol.  Two new reflecting pools (or "canals") would be constructed on the National Mall.  One (cruciform in shape) would extend from West Potomac Park to the Washington Monument.  The other would extend from East Potomac Park north to the Washington Monument. [[The Ellipse]] would remain open space in order to preserve the vista from the White House south to the Washington Monument and the [[Potomac River]].{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|pages=129-138}}

The L'Enfant Plan's diagonal streets formed the great boundaries of the city's new "monumental core".  [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] NW, already an important thoroughfare, formed the northeast boundary linking the Capitol with the White House.  The report asked the federal government to tear down the vast slum [[Murder Bay]] and replace it with a group of monumental federal office buildings similar to [[Westminster]] in London or the [[Louvre Palace]] in Paris.  Lafayette Square north of the White House would also be razed, and new federal office buildings in the Neoclassical style built there.  [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue NW]] would be extended in a southwesterly direction past the White House to link with the new memorial in West Potomac Park. Maryland Avenue SW, extending from the Capitol to East Potomac Park, would form the southeastern boundary of this new monumental core, while the Potomac River formed the southwestern boundary.  The commission suggested that taller federal buildings and museums be constructed in areas not immediately adjacent to the National Mall.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|page=138}}

===The city park system and parkways===
[[File:Proposed additions to Washington DC park system - Senate Park Commission - 1902.jpg|thumb|left|Additions to the D.C. park system (dark green) proposed by the McMillan Plan.]]
The park system proposed by the McMillan Plan drew heavily on the [[Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston]] (also designed by Olmsted).  The commission proposed establishing large numbers of neighborhood parks throughout the city, especially in those areas outside the old "Federal City" boundaries.{{Efn|Originally, government officials did not foresee that the city of Washington would expand to fill the boundaries of the entire District of Columbia.  The "Federal City", or City of Washington, originally lay within an area bounded by [[Florida Avenue|Boundary Street]] (northwest and northeast), 15th Street (east), [[East Capitol Street]], the [[Anacostia River]], the [[Potomac River]], and [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]].{{sfn|Hagner|1904|page=257}}{{sfn|Hawkins|1991|page=16}}{{sfn|Bednar|2006|page=15}}}} Public bathing and swimming facilities, gymnasiums, and playgrounds were an integral part of each proposed park, and the commission's report provided extensive drawings of "model parks".  The commission's goal was to transform parks from places where the wealthy promenaded for purposes of social mobility into places where the average citizen could reap the advantages of physical exercise while enjoying the moral uplift provided by a natural setting within an urban area. Of critical importance to the commission was the development of the Anacostia Flats along the [[Anacostia River]]. The flats (like West and East Potomac Parks) had recently been reclaimed by dumping dredged material along the riverbank to eliminate marshes. The commission suggested building roads to provide access to the Anacostia River, and constructing a large water park for boating, bathing, swimming, and other uses to draw development to the area.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|page=138}}

Linking the more important parks would be a series of [[parkway]]s, designed to allow citizens in carriages (the automobile not having come into widespread use) to become emotionally refreshed by viewing nature.  Parkways were envisioned along the south side of the Potomac River from Arlington National Cemetery down to [[Mount Vernon]], and from West Potomac Park through [[Rock Creek Park]] to the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]]. Another parkway (known as "Fort Drive"), nearly circumferential around the city, would link newly created parks designed to preserve the historic [[Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War|Civil War forts]] which circled the District of Columbia.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|page=138}}
{{clear}}

==Implementation of the plan==
Implementation of the McMillan Plan was opposed by the powerful [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]]. Cannon was angry that the Senate had bypassed the House in creating the commission, and he was strongly opposed to spending the enormous sums that it would take to complete the plan. Although Moore had implemented a carefully planned public relations campaign to win congressional and public support for the McMillan Plan, it was clear that seeking formal approval of the plan from Congress was out of the question due to Cannon's opposition.  Instead, members of the commission worked strenuously to ensure that the plan was not encroached upon, while waiting for a more opportune time to seek its implementation. Backers of the plan in Congress regularly called upon commission members to testify before Congress and in public hearings to defend the plan.

One of the most important goals of the McMillan Plan was to demolish the B&amp;P Railroad Passenger Terminal. This proposal had generated widespread support in Congress for years, and on May 15, 1902, legislation was passed authorizing construction of a new Union Station. Although extensive disagreement broke out in the House over reimbursing the Pennsylvania Railroad for the cost of moving its tracks, legislation providing this reimbursement passed in 1903. The terminal was demolished in 1908.

[[File:National Mall circa 1908 - Washington DC.jpg|thumb|350px|Construction of the two wings of the Department of Agriculture building (shown nearing completion in 1908, lower right) was a major test of the McMillan Plan.]]
The first major threat to implementing the McMillan Plan came in 1904.  A new [[United States Department of Agriculture]] building had long been proposed for the south side of the National Mall between 7th and 14th Streets SW. The Department of Agriculture wanted to use all the space allotted to it, but McMillan Plan advocates argued that agriculture headquarters should be set back from the center of the National Mall by {{convert|300|ft|m}}. Department of Agriculture officials, however, pointed out that the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} setback from the mall's center-line was already violated on the south side of the mall by the [[Smithsonian Institution Building]]. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] gave his approval for construction of a new agriculture building in line with the Smithsonian headquarters, only to later learn that his decision violated the McMillan Plan (which he also supported). Agriculture officials then argued that, if they had to accept a smaller plot of land, they should be permitted to construct a taller building to compensate for the loss of space. Extensive disagreement broke out between Agriculture officials, members of Congress intent on keeping costs low, McMillan Plan advocates, and others not only about where the building should be placed but also how tall it should be. The new Agriculture Building was eventually built according to the McMillan Plan's {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} setback line, and slightly lowered into the ground to accommodate the building's taller height.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|pages=138-139}}

The next major test of the McMillan Plan came with the siting of the Lincoln Memorial.  A Lincoln Memorial Commission was authorized by Congress in 1910, and the commission immediately began wrestling with the many competing proposals for the memorial's location. Concurrently, members of the disbanded McMillan Commission were tiring of the constant demands on their time and the unpaid nature of their role. President Roosevelt agreed that a permanent commission on the arts should be created to help guide decisions regarding art and architecture in accordance with the McMillan Plan. Roosevelt established a commission by executive order shortly before he left office, but President [[William Howard Taft]] dissolved it and won congressional approval for a statutory [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA) in 1910. Several members of the McMillan Commission were appointed to the CFA, as were many McMillan Plan supporters. When the Lincoln Memorial Commission found itself riven by disagreement over the new memorial's site, it sought out the advice of the CFA. Together, the Lincoln Memorial Commission and CFA worked together to approval West Potomac Park as the site for the new monument. The site for the Lincoln Memorial was approved in June 1911.{{sfn|Thomas|2002|pages=37-43}}

Over the years, other decisions were made which helped reinforce the status of the McMillan plan as the "official" development plan for the District of Columbia.  These included the siting of the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in 1923, the creation of the [[National Capital Planning Commission|National Capital Park and Planning Commission]] in 1926 (which was formally charged with implementing the McMillan Plan), enactment of legislation authorizing the enlargement of the Capitol grounds in 1929 (in accordance with the McMillan Plan), and passage of the Capper-Cramton city park act (which sought to implement the McMillan Plan's park program).{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|pages=138-139}} Arlington Memorial Bridge was authorized in 1925 after President [[Warren G. Harding]] got caught in a three-hour traffic jam during the dedication of the [[Tomb of the Unknowns|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]]. A lengthy fight over the location of the bridge occurred, but the CFA won the battle and the bridge's construction (in the low, classical style advocated by the McMillan Plan) was authorized by Congress on February 24, 1925. The [[Public Buildings Act]] of 1926 authorized the razing of the Murder Bay slum and the construction of [[Federal Triangle]] in 1926, and the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway|Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway]] was authorized in 1928. Although construction of a massive terrace around the base of the Washington Monument proven unfeasable (it would have destabilized the monument's foundations), the [[National World War II Memorial]] was constructed at the eastern end of the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool in 2004.

===Recent implementation efforts===
[[File:Aerial view of the Lincoln Memorial.jpg|thumb|Siting the Lincoln Memorial in West Potomac Park was a major goal of the McMillan Plan.]]
The McMillan Plan continues to provide the underpinning for planning in the national capital in the 21st century.  In 1997, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) issued a report entitled ''Extending the Legacy: Planning America's Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpc.gov/ncpc/Main%28T2%29/Planning%28Tr2%29/ExtendingtheLegacy.html|title=Extending the Legacy|website=National Capital Planning Commission|date=1997|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planning document was an attempt to update the McMillan Plan for the 21st century. It redefined the monumental core, and established new guidelines for locating museums, memorials, and federal buildings throughout the city. A second major report, ''Monumental Core Framework Plan: Connecting New Destinations with the National Mall'', was issued in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpc.gov/ncpc/Main%28T2%29/Planning%28Tr2%29/FrameworkPlan.html|title=Monumental Core Framework Plan|author1=National Capital Planning Commission|author2=United States Commission of Fine Arts|website=National Capital Planning Commission|date=2009|accessdate=January 27, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015000645/http://ncpc.gov/ncpc/Main(T2)/Planning(Tr2)/FrameworkPlan.html|archivedate=October 15, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written jointly by the NCPC and CFA, the planning document extends the McMillan Plan's values and planning concepts through the city. It proposed the creation of new "federal centers" through the city (away from the monumental core) and proposed redevelopment of the [[Washington Channel]] and Anacostia River waterfronts. A second planning effort, CapitalSpace, was also launched in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpc.gov/capitalspace/|title=CapitalSpace: A Park System for the Nation's Capital|author1=National Capitol Planning Commission|author2=National Park Service|author3=Government of the District of Columbia|website=National Capital Planning Commission|date=2009|accessdate=January 27, 2013|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2013/03/dc-plans-transformation-of-franklin.html|last=Neibauer|first=Michael|title=D.C. Plans Transformation of Franklin Park|work=Washington Business Journal|date=March 14, 2013|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint initiative of the NCPC, the [[National Park Service]], and the government of the District of Columbia, CapitalSpace is designed to implement six of the major unfinished proposals of the McMillan Plan. These include linking the Fort Circle Parks with trails and parkways, improving recreational facilities, enhancing and maintaining neighborhood parks, establishing new and repairing existing playgrounds and school play yards, ensuring the protection and restoration of natural areas within and near the city, and transforming small and underutilized parks into vibrant new neighborhood centers.

In late 2012, work began on two billion-dollar projects to implement ''Extending the Legacy: Planning America's Capital'' were announced. The first project, named "The Wharf", is a $1.45 billion redevelopment of the waterfront roughly between 9th and 7th Streets SW along the [[Washington Channel]].  The project will build 10 [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] buildings each {{convert|130|ft|m}} high. A privately owned cultural center and new public park will be included in The Wharf. A total of {{convert|3200000|sqft|m2}} will be built, with about two-thirds of that built in the first phase. [[Maine Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Maine Avenue SW]] will be remodeled, Water Street SW will be decommissioned and demolished, a pedestrian promenade built where Water Street was, and two new piers (for both private and commercial use) will be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/southwest-waterfronts-long-overdue-makeover/2012/12/20/bc162f84-48a2-11e2-820e-17eefac2f939_story.html|last=Lewis|first=Roger K.|title=Southwest Waterfront Gets Its Long-Overdue Makeover|work=The Washington Post|date=December 21, 2012|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second project announced is a $906 million project to replace and realign the aging [[Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge]] and build new interchanges between the bridge and [[Suitland Parkway]], the bridge and Potomac Avenue SW, Suitland Parkway and [[Interstate 295 (Maryland–District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]], and Suitland Parkway and [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue]]. The current four-lane bridge will be replaced with a six-lane bridge and brought into a more north–south alignment from its current northwest–southeast alignment. The cost of the bridge replacement is estimated at $573.8 million. A [[Roundabout|traffic circle]] with a large field (to be used for public gatherings, and suitable for several new memorials) will connect the north end of the bridge with Potomac Avenue SW.  A second massive traffic oval on the south end of the bridge will help connect it to Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, and help expand the city's "monumental core" into Anacostia. Reconstruction of the two interchanges is estimated to cost $209.2 million.  The remainder of the budgeted funds will help remodel South Capitol Street into an urban boulevard from an industrial corridor, and renovate New Jersey Avenue SE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/2012/12/30/22fc8f18-454c-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html|last=Halsey|first=Ashley III|title=Decaying D.C.

==Unbuilt portions of the McMillan Plan==
Several elements of the McMillan Plan remained unbuilt.

One major element was the large system of granite and marble terraces, steps, and arcades ("Washington Monument Gardens") proposed for the grounds around the base of the Washington Monument. It was later determined that construction of these features would require the removal of large quantities of earth.  This would have destabilized the monument's foundations, however, and none of the proposed elements were built.  The [[Trust for the National Mall]] and the National Park Service sponsored a design competition in 2011 to revitalize the Mall as part of a $700 million plan to transform it into a world-class park. The design partnership of [[Weiss/Manfredi]]  + [[Laurie Olin|OLIN]] won a portion of the competition to redesign the Washington Monument grounds and the nearby [[National Sylvan Theater|Sylvan Theater]]. If implemented, the plan would lightly terrace the grounds of the Washington Monument, while creating deep terraces at the Sylvan Theater to create seating.

Another unbuilt major element was a collection of tall, Neoclassical office buildings around Lafayette Square. This proposal went unbuilt as the federal government struggled to complete the Federal Triangle complex. The cost of constructing the office complex during the mid to late 1930s, and the lack of materials and manpower during World War II and the Korean War, kept the complex from being built. Although a major effort was made in 1960 to begin razing the historic homes around Lafayette Square, [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] opposed their destruction and successfully lobbied Congress and the [[General Services Administration]] to retain the structures.  Mrs. Kennedy persuaded President John F. Kennedy to allow architect [[John Carl Warnecke]] to design a plan to allow the construction of two federal office buildings behind the smaller, historic structures.  Warnecke's plan led to the construction of the [[New Executive Office Building]] in 1965 and the [[Howard T. Markey National Courts Building]] in 1967.  They were the only two large office buildings constructed near Lafayette Square, and neither was Neoclassical in design.

[[File:Washington Gardens proposed - Senate Park Commission - 1902.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The proposed "Washington Monument Gardens", a part of the McMillan Plan that was never built.]]
A third major unbuilt recommendation of the McMillan Plan involved the extensive "Washington Commons" recreational area on East and West Potomac Parks along the southern side of the [[Tidal Basin]]. The McMillan Plan evisioned extensive public bathing and swimming facilities along the Potomac River's edge here, as well as a number of athletic fields, several gymnasiums, and a stadium. Additionally, a major new Neoclassical or Beaux-Arts memorial would be constructed along the White House-Washington Monument axis to serve as the southern anchor of the cruciform National Mall plan.  The Washington Commons was to have been built after the Washington Monument terraces and arcades.  After it was determined that the Washington Monument grounds project could not be built, attention turned to Washington Commons. But by then the Great Depression was under way, and funds to complete the Tidal Basin in the form envisioned by the McMillan Plan no longer were available. In 1938, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed construction of a memorial to [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the south side of the Tidal Basin.  Although the memorial was opposed by the CFA, President Roosevelt ordered its construction and the [[Jefferson Memorial]] was completed in 1943.

The proposed "Fort Circle Drive" is another unbuilt part of the plan. In 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]] began pushing Congress to build Fort Circle Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strayer|first=Martha|title=JFK Settles Battle Over Ft. Drive|work=Washington Daily News|date=May 28, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; But civic leaders and the National Park Service openly questioned whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|1965|pages=3–9}} They argued that the city had grown past the ring of forts that protected it a century earlier, and city roads already connected the parks (albeit not in the linear route envisioned by the McMillan Plan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fort Sites Eyed for Future Use|work=The Washington Post|date=October 2, 1964|page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan to link the city's Civil War fort-parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped in the years that followed.

A final unbuilt recommendation of the McMillan Plan was the concept of grouping a large number of executive branch office buildings around the United States Congress.  The concept was two-fold: To complement the existing [[United States Botanic Garden]] (built in 1867), [[Thomas Jefferson Building|Library of Congress Building]] (built in 1897), [[Cannon House Office Building]] (built in 1908), and [[Russell Senate Office Building]] (built in 1909) to create a symmetrical look to the Capitol environs; and to reduce the time and trouble it took for executive branch workers to serve the needs of Congress. No executive branch office buildings were ever constructed. A number of buildings were constructed nearby, but they were not in the symmetrical siting or design advocated by the McMillan Plan. These structures included the [[Longworth House Office Building]] (finished in 1933), the [[United States Supreme Court Building]] (finished in 1935), and the [[John Adams Building|John Adams Library of Congress Building]] (finished in 1939). The Longworth and Adams buildings were both on the House side, and no attempt was made to purchase the land bounded by Maryland Avenue NE, 1st Street NE, and Constitution Avenue NE.  This property was quickly developed with private office buildings without reference to the McMillan Plan.  Yet another building, the [[Rayburn House Office Building]], was built on the House side in 1965. This left the [[United States Capitol Complex]] unbalanced.  Only in 1972 was the relatively small [[Dirksen Senate Office Building]] completed on the Senate side.  Thus far, all the buildings constructed were within the Beaux-Arts or "stripped Neoclassical" style.  But in 1976, construction on the [[James Madison Memorial Building|James Madison Library of Congress Building]] was completed in the southeast corner of the Capitol Complex. Not only was this building on the House side (again), but it was [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] in style and did not fit well architecturally with the other structures.  This was followed in 1982 with the Modernist [[Hart Senate Office Building]], whose primary concession to the Beaux-Arts style was a marble exterior.

Although many neighborhood parks were created in the District of Columbia pursuant to the McMillan Plan, the scope of expansion contemplated by the plan was not achieved. Implementation of the neighborhood park, playground, and recreational facilities program was left to the D.C. government, which lacked the extensive resources of the federal government to implement the McMillan Plan. Few areas beyond the old "Federal City" boundary were purchased for park or recreational land. As the city rapidly expanded, this land dramatically increased in price and the city found itself unable to obtain as much land as it wished. The inability of the city government to implement the scope of the McMillan Plan's park proposals is considered the largest failure the plan faced.

'''Missing Maps''' is a humanitarian project that preemptively maps parts of the world that are vulnerable to natural disasters, conflicts, and disease epidemics.&lt;ref name=dirmag&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing Maps Project: Volunteers Map the Way to Disaster Response|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/pressreleases/missing-maps-project-volunteers-map-the-way-to-disaster-response/423997|website=Directions Magazine|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in November 2014 by the [[American Red Cross]], [[British Red Cross]], [[Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team]], and [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders]] and has so far mapped large towns and cities in countries such as [[South Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and the [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing Maps: Filling in the Blanks|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/pressreleases/missing-maps-project-volunteers-map-the-way-to-disaster-response/423997|website=Philanthrophy Age|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The idea to create the Missing Maps project was born out of a realisation by the American Red Cross, British Red Cross, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and Médecins Sans Frontières that maps are pivotal to delivering humanitarian aid.&lt;ref name=fast&gt;{{cite web|title=Hundreds of uncharted cities will get maps thanks to crowdsourcing|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3037423/how-the-missing-maps-project-is-crowdsourcing-data-on-hundreds-of-uncharted-cities|website=Fast Company Design|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In civil wars, for example, maps can help individuals and organisations track the movement of internally displaced populations and determine where best to conduct food and non-food item distributions.&lt;ref name=dirmag /&gt; Or in the case of disease outbreaks, emergency responders can use maps to identify the source of the outbreak and identify the most effective infection control methods.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing Maps: nothing less than a human genome project for cities|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/oct/06/missing-maps-human-genome-project-unmapped-cities|website=The Guardian|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baraka, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baraka]] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the end of 2014 became one of the pilot projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/06/-sp-missing-maps-baraka-democratic-republic-congo-drc|title=Missing Maps: what is Baraka ... and how can you help map it?|last=Michael|first=Chris|date=6 November 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is aimed at preemptively mapping vulnerable parts of the world to create highly detailed maps that will be ready for first-responders to use in the event of a disaster, conflict, or disease epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing maps and ebola|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/11/daily-chart-8|website=The Economist|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on a large volunteer community to map these areas through online, remote mapping in the initial phases. Once these digital maps are validated by experienced mappers, they are then sent to field teams to be updated and revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of the crowd: how people power is reshaping aid|url=http://www.philanthropyage.org/2015/06/02/call-crowd-people-power-changing-aid/|website=Philanthropy Age|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectives ===

# To map the most vulnerable places in the developing world, in order that international and local NGOs, and individuals can use the maps and data to better respond to crises affecting the areas.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing Maps|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02b0dx8|website=BBC World Service: Click|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To support OpenStreetMap, and specifically the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), in developing technologies, skills, workflows and communities in order to achieve this.

=== Ethics ===
* '''Openness:''' Using OpenStreetMap ensures that all data gathered under the project banner will be free, open and available for use under OpenStreetMap's open license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethics|url=http://www.missingmaps.org/|website=Missing Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Collaboration:''' All local mapping and data collection is to be done in collaboration with local people and in a respectful manner at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using tech to chart the 'unmapped world'|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/06/16/using-tech-to-chart-the-unmapped-world|website=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sustainability:''' When mapping a city, there needs to be a plan in place to ensure that access to technology and training for those living in that community will continue to be available for mapping afterwards. Missing Maps projects emphasize building, and leaving behind, local capacity and access. Rapid data collection without significant local participation is to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICS volunteers help launch Missing Maps pilot|url=http://www.ycareinternational.org/2015/07/07/ics-volunteers-help-launch-missing-maps-pilot/|website=Y Care International|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Involvement:''' Members of the Missing Maps project actively contribute to the Missing Maps project objectives, the OpenStreetMap repository and benefitting communities, both local and international.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing Maps: Where Google doesn't go|url=http://www.science151.co.uk/missing-maps-google-doesnt-go/|website=Science 151|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Participation:''' Missing Maps activities are designed to be accessible and open for participation for individuals who want to contribute towards the project objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing Maps|url=http://trajectorymagazine.com/2015-issue-1/item/1912-missing-maps.html|website=Trajectory Magazine|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mapping process ==
The mapping process is largely driven by demands in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Missing Maps project is mapping developing cities to curb the spread of ebola|url=http://www.citymetric.com/horizons/missing-maps-project-mapping-developing-cities-curb-spread-ebola-383|website=City Metric|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanitarian organisations identify areas of vulnerability that are then set as tasks on the HOT tasking manager for remote mapping. Once an area has been mapped and validated, the maps are sent to field staff who work with local people to travel to the mapped areas and input names of streets and key buildings and check for errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing Maps: Putting the World's Vulnerable People on the Map|url=http://en.reset.org/blog/missing-maps-putting-world%E2%80%99s-vulnerable-people-map-11062014|website=Reset|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this step, the maps are deemed ready for use and made available online for free.

=== Identifying areas of vulnerability ===
As the mapping is done preemptively, the first step largely involves field staff from MSF, the British Red Cross, and the American Red Cross engaging in dialogue together to identify key areas of vulnerability.&lt;ref name=dirmag /&gt; They understand the challenges of implementing field projects and are often engaged in delivering frontline humanitarian assistance. Sometimes these challenges are about understanding the locations of malnourished children or the direction that a disease is spreading.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; When head offices are notified of such challenges, the Missing Maps project activates an online task for remote mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meyerfeld, Bruno |title=L’Afrique, une "terre inconnue" pour Google Maps |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2015/07/03/l-afrique-une-terre-inconnue-pour-google-maps_4669129_3212.html|website=Le Monde Afrique |date=3 July 2015|accessdate=5 August 2015 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remote mapping ===
Once the task is online on the HOT tasking manager, the three humanitarian organisations and HOT alert their supporters through social media, e-mail, and communities to the mapping need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How 'Crisis Mapping' Is Shaping Disaster Relief in Nepal|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150501-nepal-crisis-mapping-disaster-relief-earthquake/?sf8933117=1|website=National Geographic|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers trace buildings, streets, swamps, rivers, and all other landmarks onto satellite imagery using the tasking manager.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; Then volunteer validators check the map that has been created and determine whether it is ready for field mapping or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it a building?

After the maps have been declared ready for field mapping, they are printed out by humanitarian volunteers on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Missing Maps Project wants to map the world suing a global network of volunteers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/the-missing-maps-project-wants-to-map-the-world-using-a-global-network-of-volunteers/2014/11/24/8582e042-6b79-11e4-9fb4-a622dae742a2_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They work in collaboration with locals from the community to collect local data about road names, settlements, the natural landscape, and the exact locations of the people they are trying to help. This information is then put into the online map and declared ready for use.

=== Data entry ===
With detailed maps validated in the field by locals themselves, humanitarian organisations can use the mapped information to plan risk reduction and disaster response activities that save lives.&lt;ref name=fast/&gt;

[[File:Museum of Liverpool Life - DSC06866.JPG|thumb|Museum of Liverpool Life]]
The '''Museum of Liverpool Life''' was a [[Museum]] in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], part of [[National Museums Liverpool]], that focused on the contribution that the people of Liverpool made to national life.  It closed in 2006 and was replaced by the [[Museum of Liverpool]], which opened on 19 July 2011 and houses most of the original museum's exhibits.

==Exhibitions==
At the time of its closure on 4 June 2006, the museum had three galleries: ''City Lives'' explored [[Liverpool]]'s cultural diversity, ''The River Room'' described life alongside the [[River Mersey]] and ''City Soldiers'' was an exhibition about the [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's Regiment]].  

Previous exhibitions had been ''Mersey Culture, from [[Brookside]] to the [[Grand National]]'', ''Making a Living'' and ''Demanding a Voice''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9075">'''Network performance''' refers to measures of [[service quality]] of a network as seen by the customer.

There are many different ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modeled and simulated instead of measured; one example of this is using state transition diagrams to model queuing performance or to use a Network Simulator.

==Performance measures==
The following measures are often considered important:

* '''Bandwidth''' commonly measured in bits/second is the maximum rate that information can be transferred
* '''Throughput''' is the actual rate that information is transferred
* '''Latency''' the delay between the sender and the receiver decoding it, this is mainly a function of the signals travel time, and processing time at any nodes the information traverses
* '''Jitter''' variation in packet delay at the receiver of the information
* '''Error rate''' the number of corrupted bits expressed as a percentage or fraction of the total sent

===Bandwidth===
{{main|Bandwidth (computing)}}
The available channel bandwidth and achievable signal-to-noise ratio determine the maximum possible throughput. It is not generally possible to send more data than dictated by the [[Shannon-Hartley Theorem]].

===Throughput===
{{main|Throughput}}
''Throughput'' is the number of messages successfully delivered per unit time. Throughput is controlled by available bandwidth, as well as the available signal-to-noise ratio and hardware limitations. Throughput for the purpose of this article will be understood to be measured from the arrival of the first bit of data at the receiver, to decouple the concept of throughput from the concept of latency. For discussions of this type the terms 'throughput' and 'bandwidth' are often used interchangeably.

The ''Time Window'' is the period over which the throughput is measured. Choice of an appropriate time window will often dominate calculations of throughput, and whether latency is taken into account or not will determine whether the latency affects the throughput or not.

===Latency===
{{main|Latency (engineering)}}
The [[speed of light]] imposes a minimum propagation time on all electromagnetic signals. It is not possible to reduce the latency below

:&lt;math&gt;t=s/c_m&lt;/math&gt;

where s is the distance and c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the speed of light in the medium. This approximately means 1 extra millisecond roundtrip time (RTT) for 100&amp;nbsp;km/62miles of distance between hosts.&lt;!-- The value of 1 ms seems quite high for a 62 mile trip since the time in a vacuum would be 0.333 ms. This needs to be expanded some or corrected. --&gt;

Other delays also occur in intermediate nodes. In packet switched networks delays can occur due to queueing.

===Jitter===
{{main|Jitter}}
'''Jitter''' is the undesired deviation from true periodicity of an assumed periodic [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] in [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], often in relation to a reference [[clock signal|clock source]]. Jitter may be observed in characteristics such as the [[frequency]] of successive pulses, the signal [[amplitude]], or [[phase (waves)|phase]] of periodic signals. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links (e.g., [[USB]], [[PCI-e]], [[SATA]], [[OC-48]]). In [[clock recovery]] applications it is called ''timing jitter''.&lt;ref name=wol91p211&gt;[[#Wol1991|Wolaver, 1991, p.211]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Error rate===
{{main|Bit error rate}}
In [[digital transmission]], the number of '''bit errors''' is the number of received [[bit]]s of a [[data stream]] over a [[communication channel]] that have been altered due to [[noise (telecommunications)|noise]], [[interference (communication)|interference]], [[distortion]] or [[bit synchronization]] errors.

The '''bit error rate''' or '''bit error ratio''' ('''BER''') is the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transferred bits during a studied time interval. BER is a unitless performance measure, often expressed as a [[percentage]].

The '''bit error probability''' ''p&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[expectation value]] of the BER. The BER can be considered as an approximate estimate of the bit error probability. This estimate is accurate for a long time interval and a high number of bit errors.

===Interplay of factors===

All of the factors above, coupled with user requirements and user perceptions, play a role in determining the perceived 'fastness' or utility, of a network connection. The relationship between throughput, latency, and user experience is most aptly understood in the context of a shared network medium, and as a scheduling problem.

==Algorithms and protocols==

For some systems, latency and throughput are coupled entities. In TCP/IP, latency can also directly affect throughput. In [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connections, the large [[bandwidth-delay product]] of high latency connections, combined with relatively small TCP window sizes on many devices, effectively causes the throughput of a high latency connection to drop sharply with latency. This can be remedied with various techniques, such as increasing the TCP congestion window size, or more drastic solutions, such as packet coalescing, [[TCP acceleration]], and [[forward error correction]], all of which are commonly used for high latency satellite links.

TCP acceleration converts the TCP packets into a stream that is similar to [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]. Because of this, the TCP acceleration software must provide its own mechanisms to ensure the reliability of the link, taking the latency and bandwidth of the link into account, and both ends of the high latency link must support the method used.

In the Media Access Control (MAC) layer, performance issues such as throughput and end-to-end delay are also addressed.

==Examples of latency or throughput dominated systems==

Many systems can be characterized as dominated either by throughput limitations or by latency limitations in terms of end-user utility or experience. In some cases, hard limits such as the speed of light present unique problems to such systems and nothing can be done to correct this. Other systems allow for significant balancing and optimization for best user experience.

===Satellite telephony===

A telecom satellite in geosynchronous orbit imposes a path length of at least 71000&amp;nbsp;km between transmitter and receiver.&lt;ref&gt;Roddy, 2001, 67 - 90&lt;/ref&gt; which means a minimum delay between message request and message receipt, or latency of 473 ms. This delay can be very noticeable and affects satellite phone service regardless of available throughput capacity.

===Deep space communication===

These long path length considerations are exacerbated when communicating with space probes and other long-range targets beyond Earth's atmosphere. The [[Deep Space Network]] implemented by NASA is one such system that must cope with these problems. Largely latency driven, the GAO has criticized the current architecture.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Accounting Office (GAO), 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Several different methods have been proposed to handle the intermittent connectivity and long delays between packets, such as [[delay-tolerant networking]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Fall, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Even deeper space communication===

At interstellar distances, the difficulties in designing radio systems that can achieve any throughput at all are massive. In these cases, maintaining communication is a bigger issue than how long that communication takes.

===Offline data transport===

Transportation is concerned almost entirely with throughput, which is why physical deliveries of backup tape archives are still largely done by vehicle.

The '''Northern Ireland Music Archive''' is a digital [[archive]] of materials related to music from [[Northern Ireland]]. It is based on a publicly accessible computer system situated in the Music Library at [[Belfast Central Library]], [[Belfast]], [[County Antrim]]. The archive has been funded and developed by the [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Music archive launched for Northern Ireland| newspaper=[[Andersonstown News]]| date=3 April 2006| page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first materials for the archive were provided by [[BBC Northern Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Let's face the music| newspaper=[[Irish News]]| date=31 March 2006| page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were collated and [[digitisation|digitised]] from 2003 onwards, with input and assistance provided by the [[Sonic Arts Research Centre]] and Belfast Central Library.

The archive was officially launched on 30 March 2006,&lt;ref name=ACNI2006&gt;{{cite press release |title=Launch of Northern Irish Music Archive and Website |publisher=[[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]] |date=3 April 2006 |url=http://www.artscouncil-ni.org/news/2006/new03042006.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926223008/http://www.artscouncil-ni.org/news/2006/new03042006.htm |archivedate=26 September 2011 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a day of music from numerous contemporary performers including the [[Brian Irvine Ensemble]]. At its launch, it contained approximately 400 recordings and a number of scanned [[sheet music]] of pieces by [[20th century classical music|20th century]] and [[Contemporary classical music|contemporary/classical]] [[composer]]s born or settled in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Classical| author=[[Rathcol]]| newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]]| date=24 March 2006| section=TwentyFourSeven| page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts Council planned to enlarge this collection in the future, with the hope of expanding into other genres of music such as folk, rock and pop.&lt;ref name=ACNI2006 /&gt;

In 2007, a selection of [[Folk music|folk and traditional]] materials were incorporated from a sizeable collection of tapes bequeathed by local folk promoter and journalist, [[Geoff Harden]].&lt;ref name=ACNI2007&gt;{{cite press release |title=Geoff Harden music collection added to Music Archive |publisher=[[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]] |date=1 June 2007 |url=http://www.artscouncil-ni.org/news/2007/new01062007.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926223030/http://www.artscouncil-ni.org/news/2007/new01062007.htm |archivedate=26 September 2011 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of materials was digitised with additional assistance from the [[City of Belfast School of Music]]. The new additions were profiled at an official event at the library, which featured live music from local traditional musicians and a speech and song from veteran folk/traditional singer, [[Len Graham (singer)|Len Graham]].&lt;ref name=ACNI2007 /&gt;

== Materials ==
The Northern Ireland Music Archive features digitised materials of numerous formats:

[[File:Ford manual 1919.djvu|thumb|262x262px]]

An '''owner's manual''' (also called an '''instruction manual''' or a '''user guide''') is an instructional [[book]] or [[book]]let that is supplied with almost all technologically advanced consumer products such as [[vehicles]], [[home appliances]] and [[computer peripheral]]s.
Information contained in the owner's manual typically includes:
* [[Safety]] instructions; for [[Legal liability|liability]] reasons these can be extensive, often including warnings against performing operations that are ill-advised for product longevity or overall user safety reasons.
* Assembly instructions; for products that arrive in pieces for easier shipping.
* Installation instructions; for products that need to be installed in a home or workplace.
* Setup instructions; for devices that keep track of time or which maintain user accessible state.
* Instructions for normal or intended operations.
* [[Computer programming|Programming]] instructions; for [[microprocessor]] controlled products such as [[VCR]]s, [[programmable calculator]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s.
* [[Preventive maintenance|Maintenance]] instructions.
* [[Troubleshooting]] instructions; for when the product does not work as expected.
* Service locations; for when the product requires [[repair]] by a factory authorized [[technician]].
* [[Regulation|Regulatory code]] compliance information; for example with respect to safety or [[electromagnetic interference]].
* Product [[technical specifications]].
* [[Warranty]] information; sometimes provided as a separate sheet.

Until the last decade or two of the twentieth century it was common for an owner's manual to include detailed [[repair]] information, such as a [[circuit diagram]]; however as products became more complex this information was gradually relegated to specialized [[service manual]]s, or dispensed with entirely, as devices became too inexpensive to be economically repaired.

Owner's manuals for simpler devices are often [[multilingual]] so that the same boxed product can be sold in many different markets. Sometimes the same manual is shipped with a range of related products so the manual will contain a number of sections that apply only to some particular model in the product range.

With the increasing complexity of modern devices, many owner's manuals have become so large that a separate [[quickstart guide]] is provided. Some owner's manuals for computer equipment are supplied on [[CD-ROM]] to cut down on manufacturing costs, since the owner is assumed to have a computer able to read the CD-ROM. Another trend is to supply instructional video material with the product, such as a [[videotape]] or [[DVD]], along with the owner's manual.

Many businesses offer [[PDF]] copies of manuals that can be accessed or downloaded free of charge from their websites.

== Installation manual ==
An installation manual or installation guide is a [[Technical communication|technical communication]] [[Document|document]] intended to instruct people how to install a particular product. An installation manual is usually written by a [[Technical writer|technical writer]] or other technical staff. 

Installation is the act of putting something in place so that it is ready for use.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of “installation” from the Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; An installation manual most commonly describes the safe and correct installation of a product. The term product here relates to any consumer, non-consumer, hardware, software, electrical, electronic or mechanical product that requires installation. The installation of a computer program is also known as the [[Installation (computer programs)|setup]].
[[Image:Installatiehandleiding rollend hekwerk installatie.jpg|thumb|link=https://www.manualise.com/en/installation-manual/|250px|A sample of an installation manual]]
In case of an installation manual, the installation instruction is a separate document that focuses solely on the person(s) that will perform the installation. However, the installation instruction can also be an integrated part of the overall owner's manual.

The size, structure and content of an installation manual depend heavily on the nature of the product and the needs and capabilities of the intended target group. Furthermore, various standards and directives are available that provide guidance and requirements for the design of instructions.

The international standard IEC 82079&lt;ref&gt;IEC 82079-1:2012, p. 31, 5 Content of instructions for use&lt;/ref&gt; prescribes the required installation topics for an installation instruction. Among these topics, are procedures, diagrams and conditions for installation activities, such as unpacking, mounting and connecting.

For machines the European Machinery Directive prescribes that an instruction manual must contain assembly, installation and connecting instructions, including drawings, diagrams and the means of attachment and the designation of the chassis or installation on which the machinery is to be mounted.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC , p. 25-26, 1.7.4.2 Contents of the instructions.&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Car owner's manuals ==
All new cars come with an owner's manual from the manufacturer. Most owners leave them in the [[glove compartment]] for easy reference. This can make their frequent absence in [[rental car]]s frustrating because it violates the driver's [[user expectations]], as well as makes it difficult to use controls that aren't understood, which is not good because understanding control operation of an unfamiliar car is one of the first steps recommended in [[defensive driving]]. Owner's manuals usually cover three main areas: a description of the location and operation of all controls; a schedule and descriptions of maintenance required, both by the owner and by a mechanic; and specifications such as oil and fuel capacity and part numbers of light bulbs used. Current car owner's manuals have become much bigger in part due to many safety warnings most likely designed to avoid [[product liability]] lawsuits, as well as from ever more complicated audio and navigational systems, which often have their own manual.

If owners lose their car manual, they can either order a replacement from a dealer, pick up a used one secondhand, or download a PDF version of the manual online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.edmunds.com/how-to/how-to-find-your-car-owners-manual-online.html |title = How to Find Your Car Owner's Manual Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the next generation of digitized car manuals came online, which use [[Watson_(computer)|IBM Watson]] Artificial Intelligence to understand and answer questions in natural driver language&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2017/11/end-of-the-car-manual/&lt;/ref&gt;. "Ask Mercedes" was the first in a wave of these vehicle assistants which can support both speech and text-based input.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.diplomaticsales.mercedes-benz.com/passengercars/being-an-owner/ask-mercedes-campaign/stage.module.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The [[noun phrase]] ''owner's manual'' has been used by [[analogy]] in the title of numerous instructional books about entities that are not manufactured products, such as [[pet]]s, body parts and [[business]]es.

== User guides ==
The equivalent document for [[computer software]] is called a [[user guide]] since [[User (computing)|users]] are typically [[license]]es rather than [[owner]]s of the software.

== Unicode ==
The OPEN BOOK ([[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs|📖]]) Unicode symbol equals ''read operator's manual''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; OPEN BOOK has Unicode code point U+1F4D6.

'''''Paris Passion''''', also known as ''Passion'', was an English-language city magazine in France that existed from 1981 to 1991. Its main editorial focus was on life in [[Paris]] for both residents and visitors. Launched on a shoestring budget as a 24-page black-and-white tabloid, ''Passion'' eventually evolved into a glossy 140-page magazine.

''Passion'' was conceived as a forum for the written word and to showcase the visual side of Paris. It regularly published excellent photography and benefited from the pool of creative illustrators in Paris. The magazine’s use of strong eye-catching visuals on its large format covers was an influential part of its identity.

==History==
Launched in November 1981, Paris Passion was an English-language [[magazine]] in France that existed until early 1991. Its main [[editorial]] focus was on life in Paris for both residents and visitors. Also known as ''Passion'', it featured an eclectic mix of feature [[journalism]], interviews with leading figures in Paris, city consumer advice, coverage of French [[arts]], [[culture]], [[politics]], [[design]], [[architecture]], [[food]] and [[fashion]] and was also a regular showcase for excellent [[photography]].  For many years, ''Passion'' also had a detachable events-listings section, published short fiction by Paris-based writers, a French-language section, and a separate fashion supplement called ''Accent''.

Despite good distribution and a relatively high profile in Paris, ''Passion'' was more a critical success than a financial one. Its financial struggle undermined the magazine's full editorial potential. ''Passion'' began on a shoestring budget as a 24-page black-and-white tabloid and eventually evolved into a full-fledged glossy 140-page magazine. Over its nine-plus years, ''Passion'' published 78 issues.

At its peak, the circulation reached 50,000 copies, with almost a quarter of that distributed outside France. It was sold and displayed prominently in news kiosks and bookstores in Paris and even had street hawkers selling it in certain parts of the city. It was available in international newsstands in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[London]], and [[Amsterdam]] and had subscribers in many countries.

In addition to its practical information and extensive arts and [[entertainment]] coverage, ''Passion'' became popular also for its often irreverent and humorous (but not mocking) take on the [[French people|French]] and the challenges and idiosyncrasies of Paris life.

It did not shy away from serious issues. It tackled everything from the political intrigues at Paris City Hall to [[urban planning]] fiascoes to [[anti-Semitism]] in France to drug-related social problems in Paris to the plight of North African immigrants in France and a variety of environmental concerns.

''Passion'' can be seen as part of the time-honored tradition of expatriate English-language publishing in Paris that dates back to the early 20th century. Over the years, there have been numerous, mostly literary, publications published in English in the French capital, most of them short-lived.

''Passion'' was founded by expatriate Canadian journalist Robert Sarner. He moved to Paris in 1979 from [[Toronto]] where he had begun his career in journalism a few years earlier. Before starting ''Passion'', Sarner took part in the Paris-based 'Journalists In Europe' fellowship program. His partners in the magazine were Michael Budman and Don Green, both originally from [[Detroit]] and the co-founders of Roots Canada Ltd. (a successful apparel company and lifestyle brand). Sarner was the Editor-in-Chief and Publisher, while Budman and Green were the Executive Publishers. Sarner had first met Budman and Green in Canada a few years earlier when he approached them for investment in a city magazine that he had hoped to launch in Toronto.

In 1988, the London-based city magazine ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' purchased the majority of ''Paris Passion''. ''Time Out'''s owner Tony Elliott became the co-publisher with Robert Sarner who also remained the Editor-in-Chief.

Under the new ownership, ''Passion'' adopted a more conventional physical format, expanded its staff and moved into new, better-equipped headquarters. Two and a half years later, following a difference of opinion over the direction of the magazine, Elliott squeezed out Sarner in mid-1990. Elliott then brought in staff from London, redesigned the magazine, and changed the editorial style from American to British. But the business faltered further and ''Time Out'' ended up closing the magazine in 1991.

In the 1990s, ''Time Out'' used the ''Paris Passion'' name in conjunction with some of the annual Paris guides it published during that period.

==Editorial content==
''Paris Passion'' was conceived as both a forum for the written word and a showcase of the visual side of the [[city]]. One of its main objectives was to engage both the minds and the eyes of readers. To that end, the magazine drew on a wealth of freelance talent based in Paris that shared the editorial aims of its editors. Despite limited financial means, ''Passion'' featured well-established [[journalists]], [[photographers]] and [[illustrators]] while also developing many younger writers who had rarely been published before.

===Writers===
As a magazine based in, and focused on, Paris, ''Passion'' attracted a wide range of talented expatriate writers and journalists eager to have their work published in English in a creative magazine circulated both in France and abroad.  Some were longtime Paris residents, others were more recent arrivals. Most of the writers came from English-speaking counties, including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India; others were French, (especially during the period when each issue of ''Passion'' published several pages in French). Collectively, they wrote many [[Article (publishing)|articles]], [[columns]], reviews and short stories that in one way or another related to Paris.

The following are some of the writers who contributed to ''Passion'' (listed in alphabetical order): [[Kathy Acker]], [[John Baxter (author)|John Baxter]], Chris Boicos, Clement Barclay. Philip Brooks, Charla Carter, Ramesh Chandran, Tony Crawley, Claire Downey, [[David Downie]], Fiona Dunlop, Jonathan Ferziger, [[Richard Foltz]], Sarah Gaddis, [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], [[Brion Gysin]], Linda Healey, Susan Herman-Loomis, Edward Hernstadt, Amy Hollowell, Mark Honigsbaun, Mark Hunter, [[Doug Ireland]], [[Nick Kent]], Jack Kevorkian, Tanis Kmetyk, Dawn Kolokithas, Randy Koral, Corrine LaBalme, William Leone, [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]], Barbara Lippert, J.B. Miller, Carol Mongo, Lisa Nesselson, Robert Noah, Stephen O'Shea, Barbara Oudiz, Bart Plantenga, Carol Pratl, Jean Rafferty, Paul Rambali, Allen Robertson, Louis-Bernard Robitaille, Robert Rotenberg, Mark Schapiro, Peter de Selding, Antoine Silber, Claude Solnik, Jean-Sebastien Stehli, John Strand, [[William Styron]], Stephanie Theobald, Alexandra Tuttle, Rebecca Voight, Maia Wechsler, Maclin Williams, David Wray, Michael Zwerin.

==The visual side==
''Paris Passion'' was a visually striking magazine, thanks both to its large format and the quality of its [[photography]], [[illustration]] and art direction. Its visual presentation, most of which focused on Paris, was an important part of its appeal.

===Photography===
Starting with its first issue, ''Paris Passion'' always showed an appreciation for good photography, devoting generous space to photo essays, portfolios and [[portraits]] of Parisians. Photography was an intrinsic part of the magazine and helped shaped its identity. It was a natural development given the large number of talented photographers and leading photo agencies and galleries in Paris.

On a regular basis, ''Passion'' showcased the work of some of the world's leading photographers working in Paris. In the process, the magazine earned an enviable reputation for the quality of images featured in its pages.

The following are some of the photographers who worked with ''Passion'' and/or whose work was featured prominently in the magazine (listed in alphabetical order): Jim Allen, Arnaud Bauman, [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], Clement Barclay, Chalkie Davies, Francois Dischinger, Barry Dunne, Christophe Galatry, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], Frank Horvat, Benjamin Kanarek, [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], Xavier Lambours, Antoine LeGrand, Elizabeth Lennard, Erica Lennard, Jonathan Lennard, Berangere Lomont, Wily Maywald, Doug Metzler, Jacques Mitelman, [[Jean-Baptiste Mondino]], [[Helmut Newton]], Scott Osman, Andre Ostier, Ian Patrick, Alain Potignon, Ray Reynolds, [[Bettina Rheims]], David Rochline, [[David Seidner]], Jean-Loup Sieff, Alice Springs, Lawrence Sudre, Keichi Tahara, Patrick Trautwein, [[Peter Turnley]], [[Ellen von Unwerth]], Javier Vallhonrat, Claus Wickrath, Patrick Wilen, Michael Williams, Rafael Winer.

===Illustration===
As part of its design, ''Paris Passion'' also benefited from the enormous pool of gifted illustrators in Paris. It commissioned many French and expatriate illustrators to create images to enhance editorial content in the magazine.

The following are some of the illustrators who worked with ''Passion'' and/or whose work was featured prominently in the magazine (listed in alphabetical order): [[:fr:François Avril (illustrateur)|François Avril]], Jean-Paul Buquet, Helene Cote, Milo Daax, Jean-Philippe Delhomme, Bil Donovan, Blair Drawson, David Dudu Geva, Diana Huff, Myles Hyman, [[Antonio Lopez (illustrator)|Antonio Lopez]], [[Patricia Marx]], Tina Mercier, Philippe Petit-Roulet, Patricia Reznikav, Michael Roberts, Hippolyte Romain, Laurie Rosenwald, Tignous, Solweig Vonkleist.

===Art direction===
Among the graphic artists and art directors who worked with ''Passion'' and contributed to the look of the magazine were Layne Jackson, Nancy Dorking, Judith Christ, Scott Minick and Rémy Magron.

Like the rest of the magazine, ''Paris Passion'''s front covers evolved considerably from the time of its first issue in 1981 until the last in 1991. The changes included going from black-and-white images to those in full color; from newsprint to glossy stock; from celebrity portraits to more conceptual illustrations; and different logos and varying approaches to the use of text.

During the life of ''Passion'', its use of strong, eye-catching visuals on its large format covers was an influential part of its identity. ''Passion'' favored simple, clean, bold, colorful images to grab the attention of readers. It stemmed, in part, from the fact that as a magazine relying mainly on newsstands for its distribution, it had to stand out from other publications in order to establish and promote itself, especially in the absence of any marketing budget.

In Paris, in addition to its presence on newsstands and in kiosks, ''Passion'' also had a network of "street hawkers" who sold the magazine. They circulated in places where potential readers would congregate, from hip cafes and restaurants to major cultural events, fashion shows and tourist attractions where hawkers would hold up the latest issue for all to see, and hopefully buy. The cover played a critical role in determining the perception and sales of the magazine.

In the pursuit of effective images for its covers, ''Passion'' drew from the presence of many excellent photographers and illustrators in Paris (see text above). They liked seeing their work showcased on the covers of ''Passion'', thanks to its large size, its relatively unobtrusive cover text and good visibility in Paris kiosks and in international bookstores and newsstands in major cities outside France.

The website '''PriceRunner''' is a [[price comparison service]] launched in [[Sweden]] in 1999. It allows users to compare prices on a range of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pricerunner seeks advertising agency|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1082341/|website=Campaign|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial headquarters are in [[London]], England, and it also has offices in [[Stockholm]], Sweden; [[Nykøbing Falster]], Denmark; [[Munich]], Germany; [[Paris]], France;  [[California]], United States and [[Shanghai]], China.

==History==
PriceRunner was launched in 1999 as a [[price comparison service]] based in [[Sweden]] and originally financed by a venture capitalist group called Cell Ventures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pricerunner.com/about.html |title=Compare Prices - Find Best UK Deals when shopping Online - PriceRunner UK |publisher=Pricerunner.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were later acquired by NewMedia Spark. It launched the service in the UK and Denmark in 2000. Initially, they had planned to become a pan-European service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/10528/pricerunner-offers-europe--wide-price-comparison.html |title=Digital Marketing Blog |publisher=Econsultancy |date= |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some of these services were closed down in 2002 after poor financial performance.

In August 2004, it was acquired by [[ValueClick]], an online media company, for £16 million ($29 million)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/157038/valueclick-acquires-pricerunner.html |title=Digital Marketing Blog |publisher=Econsultancy |date= |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; after NewMedia Spark sold its share in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Lydia|title=NewMedia sells Pricerunner stake|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a2407ec-e67c-11d8-9bd8-00000e2511c8.html#axzz3XIDaDkZh|accessdate=14 April 2015|work=Financial Times|date=August 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further expansion saw PriceRunner reopen the [[France|French]] office in August 2004, go into Germany in October of the same year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netimperative.com/2004/10/12/Pricerunner_Germany ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125193152/http://www.netimperative.com/2004/10/12/Pricerunner_Germany |date=25 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comparisonengines.com/2005/07/26/pricerunner-announces-launch-in-the-us/ |title=PriceRunner Announces Launch in the US |publisher=ComparisonEngines |date=2005-07-26 |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also launched awards for retailers of the year based on its customer reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whipp|first1=Matt|title=Pricerunner announces its retailers of the year|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/hardware/85307/pricerunner-announces-its-retailers-of-the-year|website=PC Pro|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=23 Mar 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, it announced that it would launch a partnership service with [[118 118 (UK)|118 118]], a UK phone based service, to provide prices to people by SMS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.netimperative.com/2006/07/03/PriceRunner ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706135127/https://www.netimperative.com/2006/07/03/PriceRunner |date=6 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed an earlier failure to enter the mobile market in 2002 by providing price tracking through the site. In October, MSN announced that their [http://shopping.msn.co.uk/ Shopping sites] in France and the UK would be powered by PriceRunner and Shopping.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Crum |url=http://www.webpronews.com/financial/news/wpn-64-20061002EuropePriceRunnerMakesDealWithMSN.html |title=Yahoo Unloads Kelkoo |publisher=WebProNews |date=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had previously been powered by [[Kelkoo]].

In 2007-8 PriceRunner also set up partnerships with Ask, the [[Energy Saving Trust]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crawley-Boevey|first1=Sarah|title=PriceRunner strikes energy deal|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/article/767758/pricerunner-strikes-energy-deal|website=MediaWeek|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=19 Nov 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSN]] and [[Which?]] providing them with shopping engines for their websites. It also partnered with [[Nectar]] to offer Nectar Points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kemp|first1=Ed|title=Nectar partners with PriceRunner|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/784362/nectar-partners-pricerunner|website=Marketing Magazine|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=15 Feb 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it introduced new branding produced by agency Firedog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New branding for PriceRunner|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2011/11/21/new-branding-pricerunner|website=The Drum|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, ValueClick sold its global media properties (including [[Investopedia]], Coupon Mountain and PriceRunner) to [[IAC/InterActiveCorp|IAC]] for a reported $80 million. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iac.com/media-room/press-releases/valueclick-inc-signs-definitive-agreement-sell-owned-operated-websites-segment|title=ValueClick, Inc. Signs Definitive Agreement to Sell Owned &amp; Operated Websites Segment - IAC|work=iac.com|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, PriceRunner was sold to Swedish firm NS Intressenter. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mannheimerswartling.se/en/news/news/iacinteractivecorp-avyttrar-pricerunner-till-ns-intressenter/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Diller]] of IAC had initially been looking for "roughly $100 million" &lt;ref&gt;http://news.sky.com/story/swedes-click-with-comparison-site-pricerunner-10207745&lt;/ref&gt;, although the actual sale figure was not disclosed publicly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://us.tiendas.com|title= Price comparison }} Sunday, 28 October 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Technology==
PriceRunner uses a combination of [[screen scraping]] retailers' websites and files supplied by the retailers themselves. These prices are matched against a backend database. This is done both by using a [[fuzzy logic]] automatching system and manually by admin staff.

==Business model==
PriceRunner is similar to other price comparison services in that it is financed by advertisers, who pay on a [[pay per click]] model. It also uses [[web banners]] provided by sister company, advertising network [[ValueClick Media.]]

[[File:Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis.png|thumb|right|Half-title of Volume 1]]
'''''Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis''''' (1824–1873),{{sfn|de Candolle|1824–1873}} also known by its standard botanical abbreviation '''''Prodr. (DC.)''''', is a 17-volume treatise on botany initiated by [[A. P. de Candolle]]. De Candolle intended it as a summary of all known seed plants, encompassing [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ecology]], [[evolution]] and [[biogeography]]. He authored seven volumes between 1824 and 1839, but died in 1841. His son, [[Alphonse de Candolle]], then took up the work, editing a further ten volumes, with contributions from a range of authors. Volume 17 was published in October 1873.{{sfn|IPNI|2005}} The fourth and final part of the index came out in 1874.{{sfn|Buek|1840–1874}} The ''Prodromus'' remained incomplete, dealing only with [[dicotyledons]].

In the ''Prodromus'', De Candolle further developed his concept of [[family (botany)|families]]. Note that this system was published well before there were internationally accepted rules for [[botanical nomenclature]]. Here, a [[family (biology)|family]] is indicated as "ordo". Terminations for families were not what they are now. Neither of these phenomena is a problem from a nomenclatural perspective, the present day [[ICBN]] provides for this. Within the [[dicotyledon]]s ("classis prima DICOTYLEDONEÆ") the De Candolle system recognises (Pagination from ''Prodromus'', 17 Parts) the list:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5283">'''Schools Catalogue Information Service''' (SCIS) creates and distributes metadata for English-language resources used in [[K-12]] schools, primarily for integration with [[Integrated library system|integrated library systems]].
As of 2016, over 94% of Australian K-12 schools subscribed to SCIS, over 55% of New Zealand schools, and schools from 25 other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Education Services Australia|title=Annual Report 2015-16|date=2016|publisher=Education Services Australia, Ltd|location=Melbourne|page=27|url=https://www.esa.edu.au/docs/default-source/default-document-library/esa_annual_report_2015-16_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Data and Standards ==
As well as doing original cataloguing, SCIS maintains the SCIS Subject Headings List (SCISSHL), an alternative to the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] suited to use in K-12 education contexts, and the SCIS Standards for Cataloguing And Data Entry (SSCDE). SSCDE reflects international standards including [[Resource Description and Access]] and [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] with adaptations to suit the K-12 education sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Connell|first1=Judy|title=RDA for school libraries: The next generation in cataloguing|journal=Access|date=2013|volume=27|issue=4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hider|first1=Philip|title=Contemporary Cataloguing Policy and Practice in Australian Libraries|journal=Australian Academic &amp; Research Libraries|date=2014|volume=45|issue=3|pages=193-204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCIS catalogues bibliographic and audio-visual resources, both physical and digital, including trade fiction and non-fiction and educational materials. SCIS metadata includes full and abridged [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], subject headings from SCISSHL and the linked-data Schools Online Thesaurus, and name and series authorities maintained by SCIS. SCIS data supports [[Machine Readable Cataloging|MAchine-Readable Cataloguing]] and [[Metadata Object Description Schema]] formats and is made available to subscribing schools via the [[z39.50]] protocol and via the online portal [https://scisdata.com scisdata.com].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chadwick|first1=Benjamin|title=SCIS is more|journal=Connections|date=2017|volume=102|page=14|url=https://www.scisdata.com/connections/issue-102/scis-is-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hider|first1=Philip|last2=Freeman|first2=Ashley|title=A Comparison of ScOT and SCISSH as Subject Retrieval Aids in School Library Catalogues|journal=Access|date=2009|volume=23|issue=4|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=M|title=Library Technician Courses-Recognition|journal=Incite|date=2007|volume=28|issue=7|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chadwick|first1=Benjamin|title=When MARC consumed ScOT: a tale of linked educational metadata|journal=VALA2016 - Proceedings|date=2016|url=https://www.vala.org.au/direct-download/vala2016-proceedings/vala2016-papers/727-vala2016-session-2-chadwick-paper/file}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Background ==
SCIS is a business unit of Education Services Australia (ESA). ESA is a not-for-profit [[government business enterprise]] established from a 2009 merger of Curriculum Corporation and [[Education.au]], with the purpose of delivering educational technology solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Standing Committee on Education and Employment|title=Inquiry into school libraries and teacher librarians in Australian schools|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/%20House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=ee/schoollibraries/report/chapter5.htm|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Australian Schools Catalogue Information Service (ASCIS) was created in 1984 with funding from Australia’s Commonwealth Schools Commission, with the purpose of reducing the cost and duplication of effort of cataloguing resources in schools. This closely followed the 1981 creation of the [[Australian Bibliographic Network]] (later to become Libraries Australia), set up to support shared bibliographic data for university, state, public and special libraries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Library Of Australia|title=Our History|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/librariesaustralia/about/history/#abn|website=Libraries Australia|publisher=National Library Of Australia|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed Curriculum Corporation subsumed ASCIS in 1989. The name SCIS was adopted when the New Zealand government joined the board of Curriculum Corporation in 1992. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deveson|first1=Lance|title=Looking back: school library catalogues and the online revolution|journal=Connections|date=2017|volume=100|pages=1-3|url=https://www.scisdata.com/connections/issue-100/looking-back-school-library-catalogues-and-the-online-revolution/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spence-Richards|first1=Pamela|last2=Wiegand|first2=Wayne|last3=Dalbello|first3=Marija|title=A History of Modern Librarianship: Constructing the Heritage of Western Cultures|date=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9781440834738|pages=191-193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1361">The '''Severe Letter''' or '''Letter of Tears''' was a letter written to the [[Corinth]]ians by the [[Apostle Paul]]. It is mentioned in [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians 2:4]]: "''For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.''" This description does not match [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First Corinthians]], so there are two main theories on the Severe Letter:

#The first theory is that the Severe Letter is lost.
#The second theory is that the "Severe Letter" is preserved in 2 Corinthians 10–13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/goodspeed/ch05.html THE SECOND LETTER TO THE CORINTHIANS], from "An Introduction to the New Testament", By Edgar J.

The '''Smithsonian Institution Shelter''', also known as the '''Mount Whitney Summit Shelter''', was built in 1909 on the summit plateau of [[Mount Whitney]], in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] within [[Sequoia National Park]], in [[California]].

==History==
The shelter at the summit was proposed after Byrd Surby, a U.S. Fisheries employee, was struck and killed by lightning on the summit in 1904.
The shelter was built to house scientists who used the 14,505-foot summit to study high-altitude phenomena in the time before sustained high-altitude flight was possible.

In 1909 the site was used by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory director [[Charles Greeley Abbot]] to conduct spectroscopic observations of [[Mars]] to investigate the existence of water on the planet. Other studies included observations of [[cosmic rays]] and [[Radiative cooling#Nocturnal surface cooling|nocturnal radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-sihistory.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!11842!0|date=2008-12-09|work=|title=SAO Mount Whitney Shelter Erected|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Research Information System}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonepinechamber.org/history/whitneyhist2.html|date=2008-12-09|work=Mount Whitney History|title=Mt.

Although the structure was built in part as a shelter from storms, hikers are now warned against seeking shelter there during lightning storms.

==Landmark==
Gustave F. Marsh, the builder of the summit trail, built the shelter with funding from the [[Smithsonian Institution]], with assistance from the [[Lick Observatory]]. The mortared [[granite]] shelter comprises three rooms in a line with windows in each and doors in the north and south rooms. The roof is corrugated metal on a steel truss frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hscl.cr.nps.gov/insidenps/report.asp?STATE=CA&amp;PARK=SEKI&amp;STRUCTURE=&amp;SORT=&amp;RECORDNO=60|date=2008-12-09|work=List of Classified Structures|title=Smithsonian Institution Shelter|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shelter has a log book for all hikers to sign when they make it to the summit of Mt. Whitney.
The site has been considered for [[National Historic Landmark]] status, but has not been recommended for submission yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/butowsky5/astro5a.htm|date=2008-12-09|work=National Historic Landmarks: Astronomy and Astrophysics, Other Sites|title=National Register Sites considered but not recommended for designation as National Historic Landmarks|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 1977 the Smithsonian Institution Shelter was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

On [[Microsoft Windows]], a '''special folder''' is a [[Folder (computing)|folder]] which is presented to the user through an interface as an abstract concept instead of an absolute folder path. (The synonymous term '''shell folder''' is sometimes used instead.) Special folders make it possible for any application to ask the operating system where an appropriate location for certain kinds of files can be found; independently of which version or user language of Windows is being used.

In [[Windows Server 2003]] and earlier, a folder like the "Start Menu" had a different name on non-English versions of Windows. For example, on German versions of [[Windows XP]] it is "Startmenü". However, starting with Windows Vista, all versions of Windows use the same English named folders and only display different names in the Windows Explorer. In [[Windows 10]] the user can switch to another display language and the names of the special folders will change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Change the Display Language in Windows 10|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/232659/how-to-change-the-display-language-in-windows-10/|website=How-To Geek|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106005440/http://www.howtogeek.com/232659/how-to-change-the-display-language-in-windows-10/|archivedate=Nov 6, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Image:Windows XP Shell Namespace.png|right|frame|'''Figure 1''': [[Windows Explorer]]'s folder view in Windows XP uses virtual folders as the root.]]

Windows uses the concept of special folders to present the contents of the storage devices connected to the computer in a fairly consistent way that frees the user from having to deal with absolute file paths, which can (and often do) change between operating system versions, and even individual installations. The idea has evolved over time, with new special folders being added in every version of Windows post their introduction in [[Windows 95]].

[[Microsoft]]'s "Compatible with Windows" software logo&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dd203105.aspx Windows Software Logo Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{failed verification|date=February 2010}}--&gt; requires that an application make use of special folders locations to locate the appropriate folders in which documents and application settings should be stored.

A special folder can either be a reference to a physical file system directory, or a reference to a "virtual" folder. In the former case, they are analogous to [[environment variables]] &amp;mdash; in fact, many of the environment variables that are set in a user's session are defined by where the special folders are set to point to.

Virtual folders do not actually exist on the file system; they are instead presented through [[Windows Explorer]] as a tree of folders that the user can navigate. This is known as the [[Windows Shell namespace|Shell namespace]]. On Windows XP systems, the root of this namespace is the ''Desktop'' virtual folder, which contains the ''[[My Documents]]'', ''My Computer'', ''[[My Network Places]]'' (''Network Neighborhood'' in Windows 95 and 98) and ''[[Recycle bin (computing)|Recycle Bin]]'' virtual folders. Some virtual folders (like Desktop) have an accompanying special folder that is a reference to a directory on the physical file system. Windows Explorer displays the combined contents of a virtual folder and its associated file system folder to the user. This can be seen in '''Figure 1''', which shows the Folder view in Windows XP's Explorer; in the Desktop virtual folder, the four standard virtual folders can be seen, as well as an additional folder, "a folder on the desktop", which is a real folder located in the Desktop directory in the user's profile.

Some third-party programs add their own virtual folders to Windows Explorer.

== List of special folders ==
The following tables list most of the file system and virtual folders that are available as of [[Windows Vista]]. The OS version in which each special folder was introduced is given as well. Items like %USERPROFILE% and %windir% are Windows [[Environment variables#Examples from Microsoft Windows|environment variables]].

'''Tamilization''' is the cultural expansion of the [[Tamil people]] native to the southern part of [[India]] and the northern and easthern part of [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cscsarchive.org/MediaArchive/audience.nsf/(docid)/7D62AD0BFC4DC729E5256BEA00285DC8 | publisher=cscsarchive.org | title=Dharna against ‘Tamilisation’of KGF - Deccan Herald | quote=Tamilisation of bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paths2people.com/2011/07/04/sri-lanka-sinhalisation-of-the-north-and-tamilisation-of-the-south/ | publisher=Paths2People | title=Sri Lanka: Sinhalisation of the North and Tamilisation of the South : paths2people | quote=Tamilisation of southern sri lanka | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201191212/http://www.paths2people.com/2011/07/04/sri-lanka-sinhalisation-of-the-north-and-tamilisation-of-the-south/ | archivedate=2015-02-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamils traditional homeland according to [[Sangam period]] sources covered the modern states [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]], [[Puducherry]], [[Lakshadweep]] and southern parts of [[Karnataka]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]], although ancient Tamil settlement were also found in [[Sri Lanka]] ([[Sri Lankan Tamils]]) and [[Maldives]] ([[Giraavaru people|Giravarus]]). However, between the 2nd century BC and the 14th century AD, Tamil trader colonies were established in many parts of [[West Asia]], [[South-East Asia]] and [[Egypt]] apart from the islands of the Indian Ocean.

During British rule, large numbers of Tamils from the [[Madras Presidency]] were transported to [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Mauritius]], [[Seychelles]], [[South Africa]], Central Sri Lanka, Reunion, [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Fiji]] and [[Guyana]] to work as indentured labourers in sugar plantations. There was also a large mercantile class in [[Burma]], Sri Lanka, [[South-East Asia]] and the Persian Gulf countries.

== Sri Lanka ==

The first colonies of Tamil-speaking people outside the Indian mainland were founded in Sri Lanka. While there has been evidence of pre-historic Tamil settlements in Sri Lanka, the earliest records of a Tamil presence in the island date from about 185 BC, when the legendary Chola
king [[Ellalan]] invaded and conquered Sri Lanka. Migration accelerated between the 5th and 14th centuries AD, when the [[Pallava]], Chola and [[Pandya]] kings mounted large-scale expeditions to conquer the island. The presence of a large number of Tamil mercenaries in the island by the 11th century CE is indicated by the [[Velakkara Revolt]]. The migrations rapidly decreased after the attack of the Pandya kingdom by the Delhi Sultanate's Muslim general [[Malik Kafur]] in about 1317, though cultural and commercial contact between the southern Tamil Nadu and northern Sri Lanka continued. The [[Nayaks of Kandy]] had matrimonial alliances with the [[Thanjavur Nayak kingdom]]. Following the conquest of the Kandy kingdom by the [[East India Company]] in 1795, the British ruled the island as a part of Madras Presidency till 1803, when a separate administration was set up. Starting from the middle of the 19th century, the British transported large numbers of Tamils to work as indentured labourers in the hills of central Sri Lanka.

As of 2012, Tamil speakers constituted 25 percent of the total population of Sri Lankan population with large concentrations in the northern, north-eastern and central parts of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/CPH2011/Pages/Activities/Reports/FinalReport/Population/Table%20A3.pdf|title=Census of Population and Housing of Sri Lanka, 2012|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Census of Population and Housing of Sri Lanka, 2012|publisher=Department of census and statistics - sri lanka|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been uninhibited exchange of vocabulary between Tamil and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]. Tamil is one of the official languages of Sri Lanka.

== De-Tamilization ==

De-Tamilization refers to disappearance of Tamil culture and language. By the end of 13th century, the power of Tamil dynasties like [[Pandyan]]s, [[Chera]]s and [[Chola]]s slowly declined in [[Tamilakam]]. The [[Tamil language]] disappeared in western [[Tamilakam]] ([[Kerala]]), which led to the rise of [[Malayalam]], the people's language.&lt;ref&gt;"The earliest Malayalam inscription found is the Edakkal-5 inscription of 4th century CE." {{Cite web|url= https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/the-earliest-inscription-in-malayalam/article3501408.ece/amp/| title= Oldest Malayalam inscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state backed De-Tamilization or [[Sinhalisation]] of [[Sri Lanka]] was a major factor in contributing to the ethnic polarization towards the outbreak of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethnocracy: Land and Identity Politics in Israel/Palestine, University of Pennsylvania Press, 27.06.2006, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armada Service''' (''alias'' '''Tudor Service''') is a set of more than 31 gilded silver dishes, dated between 1581 and 1601, formerly owned by Sir [[Christopher Harris (died 1625)| Christopher Harris]] (c. 1553–1625), MP, of [[Radford, Plymstock|Radford House]] in the parish of [[Plymstock]] in [[Devon]], [[England]].  Twenty-six of these dishes are now in the collection of the [[British Museum]] in London.

==Description==
The dishes are [[Gilding|parcel gilt]] with reeded rims and are engraved with the arms of Sir Christopher Harris of Radford.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=1140979001&amp;objectid=70665#more-views&lt;/ref&gt; The Sherborne Mercury newspaper of Dorset reported on 28 January 1828, that following an "inspection the Herald's office, London, the arms, which are very perfect all the pieces, were those of Sir Christopher Harris, an ancestor of the Harris family of Radford, near Plymouth, quartered with those of his wives,and who lived in the year 1600".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genesreunited.co.uk/searchbna/results?memberlastsubclass=none&amp;searchhistorykey=0&amp;keywords=christopher%20harris&amp;county=dorset,%20england&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of Sydenham are also said to be present, supposedly of one of Harris's wives "Mary Sydenham", who is not however listed in authoritative biographies.&lt;ref&gt;Harris married twice (per his authoritative [[History of Parliament]] biography[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/harris-christopher-1553-1625]), but not to a "Mary Sydenham" as is stated in many sources&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Francis Drake did however have a connection with the Sydenham family of [[Combe Sydenham]] in Somerset. They bear prominent and large [[Hallmark|London hallmarks]] on the upper rims for the years 1581, 1599, 1600 and 1601.&lt;ref name="Caygill1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caygill|first=Marjorie|title=The British Museum: A-Z companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0hGAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1999|publisher=[[British Museum Press]]|isbn=978-0-7141-2157-4|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such collections served two distinct purposes: to increase family prestige and to act as a store of value or investment.

==Discovery==
During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] (1642–1651) huge amounts of silver were melted down to pay for military supplies and wages, and the silver dishes were buried by the Harris family on the wild moorland of [[Dartmoor]], near to Radford, to avoid being looted by [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] troops. The silver was never subsequently recovered by the Harris family, who remained at Radford until after 1810,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tristram Risdon|Risdon, Tristram]] (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, 1810 Additions, p.396&lt;/ref&gt; but was at last discovered in 1827, when three farm labourers employed by the Splat company of [[Brixham]], discovered it in a cave they were excavating to increase the storage capacity for the company's potatoes. The local newspaper reported that "upwards of 30 dishes" had been found.&lt;ref name=Roadshow/&gt; In June 1911 the Splat family sold the dishes at [[Christie's]] auctioneers in London for £11,500 .&lt;ref name="Hersey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goarticles.com/article/The-Silver-Armada-Dish-and-Their-History/1579896/ |title=The Silver Armada Dish and Their History |first1=Stewart |last1=Hersey |date=1 May 2009 |publisher=GoArticles.com |accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
The service has been described as "one of the most important groups of English silver to have been found in England."&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=63AE671F8C90528BD19D11130A9BFD77.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7869294 |title=The ‘Armada Service’: a Set of Late Tudor Dining Silver |first1=Dora |last1=Thornton |first2=Michael |last2=Cowell |journal=The Antiquaries Journal |volume=76 |date=March 1996 |pages=153–180 |publisher=The Society of Antiquaries of London/Cambridge Journals On Line |doi=10.1017/S0003581500047454 |accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As a set of relatively plain objects, of which the [[bullion]] value may have exceeded the artistic worth, this service represents "the unique survival of a type of utilitarian plate which is listed in the inventories of the gentry and aristocracy of the late [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and early [[Stuart period|Stuart]] periods."&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hersey"/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
The [[nomenclature]] of the hoard's name is subject to speculation by scholars. It was named by modern scholars the ''Armada Service'' in allusion to the [[Spanish Armada]] of 1588, a failed attempt by Spain to invade England, as it is believed to have a connection to [[New World]] silver captured and pilfered from the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] operating at about that time. 31 pieces were "commissioned to mark the conquering of the Spanish naval fleet and used at a dinner thrown" at Harris's seat at Radford.&lt;ref name="Alastair"/&gt; Some modern scholars have suggested a connection to the ''[[Madre de Deus]]'' (''Mother of God''), a Portuguese ship captured by the English in about 1590.&lt;ref name="Hersey"/&gt; However, Sir Christopher Harris worked for [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] in the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]] during the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)]]. His acquisition of these dishes at about the same time may suggest that they "represent the profits of his office".&lt;ref name="BM"/&gt;

==Subsequent history==
26 dishes were acquired in July 1992 by the [[British Museum]], when valued at [[Pound sign|£]]900,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Susan M|title=On Collecting: An Investigation Into Collecting In The European Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4b_8yeeZ2NcC&amp;pg=PA296|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1995 |location=London, New York |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-07561-9|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013 an additional silver spice dish from the  service was valued at "about £100,000" on the [[BBC One]] television show ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', by [[Alastair Dickenson]], the programme’s silver expert.&lt;ref name=Roadshow&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0159j80/Antiques_Roadshow_Series_35_Cheltenham_Town_Hall_1/ |title=Antiques Roadshow – Series 35 – 18.

'''''The Yale Book of Quotations''''' is a [[quotation]]s collection that focuses on modern and American quotations and claims a high level of scholarship and reliability. Edited by [[Fred R. Shapiro]], it was published by [[Yale University Press]] in 2006 with a foreword by [[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]], {{ISBN|978-0-300-10798-2}}. Prior to publication it was referred to by its working title, ''The Yale Dictionary of Quotations''. The book presents over 12,000 quotations on 1067 pages. It is arranged alphabetically by author (or, for some quotations, by quotation type), with some information as to the source of each quotation and, where the editor deems this relevant, cross-references to other quotations. A [[Index term|keyword]] index allows the reader to generally find quotations by significant words in the quotations.

== Different focus ==
As described in its introduction, ''The Yale Book of Quotations'' is characterized by its greater focus, relative to its nearest competitors, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'' and ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', on modern American quotations, including those that do not have conventional literary sources. These include quotations from politicians, judges, journalists, [[sportscaster]]s, athletes, screenwriters, songwriters, and anonymous sources. There are special sections for some kinds of quotations, including [[advertising slogan]]s, [[film]] lines, [[folk music|folk]] and anonymous songs, political slogans, [[proverb]]s, and television [[catchphrase]]s. There is also coverage of traditional literary sources. There are, for example, 400 quotations from the [[Bible]], 106 quotations from [[Charles Dickens]], 127 quotations from [[T. S. Eliot]], 153 quotations from [[Mark Twain]], and 455 quotations from [[William Shakespeare]].  This coverage is less extensive than that offered by ''Bartlett's'', which provides 1,642 quotations from the Bible and 1,906 from Shakespeare.

== Research into origins ==
''The Yale Book of Quotations''' introduction also exhaustively describes the editor's attempts at research to identify many famous quotations, trace them to their original sources as far as possible, and record those sources as precisely and accurately as he could. In compiling the book, Shapiro made extensive use of online databases to find earlier or more precise information about famous quotations. He also used the [[Stumpers-L|Stumpers]] network of reference librarians and other research professionals; and the [[American Dialect Society]] electronic mailing list, as well as traditional library research. Shapiro claims that, to ensure that famous quotations were included, he reviewed more than a thousand previous quotations collections and other types of anthologies, read the alt.quotations newsgroup and other Internet and online resources for a while, and consulted experts on famous authors and types of literature.

== Correcting misattributions  ==
Shapiro's research resulted in some interesting findings, on occasion correcting misattributions elsewhere. The following are representative:
*It was the [[Earl of Sandwich]] and the English actor and playwright [[Samuel Foote]] who had the exchange  "I think, that you must either die of the p-x, or the halter."  "My lord, that will depend upon one of two contingencies;--whether I embrace your lordship's mistress, or your lordship's principles."  ''The Yale Book of Quotations'' traces this to an 1809 source.  ''Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'' attributed the exchange to Sandwich and [[John Wilkes]], based upon a 1935 book.
*"Go West, young man" was indeed by [[Horace Greeley]]. As ''The Yale Book of Quotations'' describes in a detailed note, many reference works, including ''Bartlett's'' and ''The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations'', wrongly attribute it to [[John B. L. Soule|John Soule]].
*"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch" is traced to the ''[[Reno Evening Gazette]]'' on January 22, 1942, in the form "such a thing as a 'free' lunch never existed." Such a finding would have been unlikely without the use of electronic databases.&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/magazine/27wwwl-guestsafire-t.html?_r=0 "On Language - Quote ... Misquote"], NYTimes.com, July 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;dq= ''The Yale Book of Quotations''], Yale University Press, 2006, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt; (Subsequent to the publication of the book, Shapiro reported the discovery of a 1938 use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/quotes-uncovered-the-punchline-please/ Shapiro, Fred (). "Quotes Uncovered: The Punchline, Please". ''[[New York Times]]'' – [[Freakonomics]] blog, July 16, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;)
*The remark that [[Fred Astaire]] "was great, but don't forget that [[Ginger Rogers]] did everything ''he'' did, . . . backwards and in high heels" has been attributed to [[Ann Richards]], [[Linda Ellerbee]], or [[Faith Whittlesey]]. Shapiro found that the earliest reference was in the ''[[Frank and Ernest (comic strip)|Frank and Ernest]]'' comic strip on [http://www.frankandernest.com/cgi/view/display.pl?82-05-03 May 3, 1982], and he contacted the strip's creator, [[Bob Thaves]], to confirm that Thaves was the originator.

[[File:Terezin CZ Magdeburg Barracks Ater91.jpg|thumb|The "Magdeburg Barracks" was the seat of the Council of Elders and the Jewish self-government of the ghetto.]]

The '''Theresienstadt Papers''' (in German original '''Theresienstadt-Konvolut''') are a collection of historical documents of the Jewish self-government of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]. These papers include an "A list" of so-called "prominents" interned in the camp and a "B-list" created by the Jewish Elders themselves. The Theresienstadt papers include two albums with biographies and many photographs, 64 watercolors and drawings from prisoners in Theresiendstadt, and the annual report of the Theresienstadt Central Library.&lt;ref name="Thersienstadt-Konvolut"&gt;[http://www.ghetto-theresienstadt.de/pages/k/konvolut.htm Das Theresienstadt-Konvolut] auf www.ghetto-theresienstadt.info&lt;/ref&gt; The papers were preserved at the liberation of the camp in May 1945 by Theresienstadt librarian [[Käthe Starke-Goldschmidt]] and later loaned to the [[Altona Museum for Art and Cultural History]] in Hamburg by her son Pit Goldschmidt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ebTAAAAQBAJ|title=A Fatal Balancing Act: The Dilemma of the Reich Association of Jews in Germany, 1939–1945|last=Meyer|first=Beate|date=30 September 2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=|isbn=9781782380283|location=|pages=319|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feuß5f"&gt;Axel Feuß: ''Das Theresienstadt-Konvolut.''

Februar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== The prominents of Theresienstadt==
Theresienstadt, also called Terezin, was a hybrid of [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|ghetto]] and concentration camp. Although in practice the ghetto, run by the SS, served as a transit camp for Jews en route to [[extermination camps]], it was also presented as a "model Jewish settlement" for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

From 1942, the Nazis interned the Jews of Bohemia and Moravia, elderly Jews and persons of "special merit" in the Reich, and several thousand Jews from the Netherlands and Denmark. The camp became known as the destination for the ''Altentransporte'' ("elderly transports") of German Jews, older than 65. Many prominent artists from Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Germany were imprisoned at Theresienstadt, along with writers, scientists, jurists, diplomats, musicians, and scholars.

Among the western European Jews deported to the camp were 456 Jews from Denmark, sent to Theresienstadt in 1943, and a number of European Jewish children whom Danish organizations had tried to conceal in foster homes. The arrival of the Danes was significant, as their government requested access to the camp for the [[International Red Cross]], so that they could view and evaluate conditions there. Historians believe the Nazis complied with the request to keep the Danes satisfied, as they were impressed by the production of Danish workers in factories. In addition, the tide of war was changing.

As part of the general preparations for the Red Cross visit, in the spring of 1944, the Gestapo screened the Jews of Theresienstadt, classifying them according to social prominence. The prominents of Theresienstadt were catalogued in two almost identical portfolios in blue cardboard cover and fasteners.&lt;ref name="Thersienstadt-Konvolut"/&gt; Begun on 1 January 1944, these binders include not only resumes and many photographs, but identified the individual according to which category of prominence they fit, "A" or "B". The so-called prominents included cultural professionals, high-ranking military officers, politicians, scientists, aristocrats, bankers and industrialists and also, in some cases, their families.

Those with prominent status drew generally favorable treatment from the camp commandant, including homes with better living conditions, greater food rations, no obligation to work, and, for the "prominent category A", first transport protection.&lt;ref name="Feuß13f"&gt;Axel Feuß: ''Das Theresienstadt-Konvolut.'', Hamburg/München 2002, S. 13f.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Red Cross visit, some 150 to 200 prominent individuals were assigned to single rooms that would be shared by only two people, so that a husband and wife could live by themselves. Several members of the Cultural Council – the "Jewish self-government of Theresienstadt" selected on demand of the Nazis – were included on the prominent list, due to the influence of [[Benjamin Murmelstein]], then an Elder of Theresienstadt. Former prisoners suggested in statements that those who held positions of authority practiced [[nepotism]], trying to protect individuals close to them, while struggling to avoid deportation and death in the closing days of the war.&lt;ref name="Broder" &gt;{{cite web

== Watercolors and drawings ==
[[File:Pamětní deska na rodném domě Petra Kiena.JPG|thumb|Peter Kien (1919–1944)]]

The 64 watercolors and drawings from the Theresienstadt camp were rescued by chief librarian [[Hugo Friedmann]] who had been gathering them secretly with the knowledge of library director [[Emil Utitz]]. He passed these works to Starke-Goldschmidt in September 1944, just before his deportation through [[Auschwitz]] to [[Dachau]].&lt;ref&gt;Käthe Starke: ''Der Führer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt.'', Berlin 1975, S.144&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes only a small part of the drawings and watercolors produced by artists within Theresienstadt to document daily life. (Many visual artists in Theresienstadt were employed in the design office of its Technical Department.) According to Starke-Goldschmidt, the artists lacked drawing paper, so she provided them with blank pages from the volumes within the library itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/bilder-einer-namenlosen/370694.html|title=Bilder einer Namenlosen|last=Müller-Frank|first=Stephanie|date=7 July 2002|website=Der Tagesspiegel|access-date=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes a self-portrait by [[Julie Wofthorn]] as well as images by [[Felix Bloch]], [[Bedřich (Friedrich) Fritta]], [[Leo Haas]], [[Peter Kien]] and [[Otto Ungar]]. Some of these artists were eventually deported, with their families, to Auschwitz because the camp commandant became aware that they were smuggling images of "atrocity propaganda," as the Nazis termed it, to Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Feuß: ''Das Theresienstadt-Konvolut.'' Hamburg/München 2002, S. 14f., S. 79ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Central Library==
The Theresienstadt Central Library was one of several libraries in the combined ghetto and camp. The Central Library had been opened on the order of the camp commandant in November 1942 and remained active until the camp was dissolved, although the bulk of library staff was deported to Auschwitz in autumn of 1944 after the library had been beautified and shown to the Red Cross. During its years in operation, the library grew from a collection of 4,000 volumes to, at the end of the war, 180,000. Books included Hebraica, Judaica, fiction and classics alongside volumes of philosophy, history, and linguistic and scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Feuß117f"&gt;Axel Feuß: ''Das Theresienstadt-Konvolut.'' Hamburg/München 2002, S. 117f.&lt;/ref&gt; The books had been confiscated from private individuals as well as from libraries, with 75% originating in Czechoslovakia and the rest coming from the German Reich. After the war, the holdings of the library were largely transferred to the [[Jewish Museum in Prague]] and, secondarily, to the Jerusalem National Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghetto-theresienstadt.info/pages/g/ghettobuecherei.htm ''Ghettozentralbücherei''] auf www.ghetto-theresienstadt.info&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tigerfibel cover.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Cover of the ''Tigerfibel'' tank manual published during WWII in Germany]]
The '''''Tigerfibel''''' and '''''Pantherfibel''''' were crew instruction manuals for the German tanks of [[World War II]], the [[Tiger I|Panzer VI Tiger]] [[heavy tank]] and the [[Panther tank|Panzer V Panther]] medium tank.

Like other manuals designated as ''Fibel'' (basic primer), they were apparently intended to summarise what the crew needed to know for day-to-day use of the tank, and to capture their interest. It is well illustrated in comic-style and much of the text is written as [[poetry]] in a humorous manner. The Fibel is remarkably different from the typical tedious style of a German tank manual of that period.

The manuals were approved by [[Heinz Guderian]], the Inspector-General of [[Panzer]] troops.  In the case of the Panther manual, he issued his approval in the manual's rhyming style, ending with the words, ''Die Pantherfibel ist genehmigt; wer sie nicht kennt, der wird erledigt''  (roughly "The Panther fible is approved; who knows it not will be removed." &lt;!-- though that rhymes more purely than the original !--&gt;)

The '''''Tulane Journal of International and Comparative Law''''' was founded at [[Tulane University Law School]], in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], as an outgrowth of that institution's historical tradition as a signpost in the academic world for international and [[comparative law]]. The ''Journal'' is dedicated to discussing and debating all facets of [[international law]], from human rights to transnational commerce to the historical evolution of current global law. The ''Journal'' is one of the leading law reviews in international and comparative law and, in terms of citation, is in the top quarter of all journals in the nation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4867">The '''Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence''' was issued by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] on 28 February 1922. Through this declaration, the British government unilaterally ended its [[protectorate]] over [[Egypt]] and granted it nominal independence with the exception of four "reserved" areas: foreign relations, communications, the military and the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Joan Wucher |title=Historical Dictionary of Egypt |series=Books of Lasting Value |year=1989 |origyear=First published 1984 |publisher=[[AUC Press|American University in Cairo Press]] |isbn=978-977-424-213-7 |pages=259–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The declaration was preceded by a period of inconclusive negotiations between the Egyptian and British governments. Areas of disagreement included Egypt's position on the issues of the protectorate and of its future role in Sudan. Egyptian prime minister [[Adli Yakan Pasha]] and moderate Egyptian nationalists managed to obtain the agreement of British High Commissioner [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]] to secure the more general issue of Egypt's independence. The government of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] British prime minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] wanted to maintain the protectorate over Egypt. However, Allenby threatened to resign. His actions brought the issue of Egyptian independence to public discussion and led to a quick official response: two weeks later the declaration was issued.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;

Although it met the Egyptian nationalists' immediate demands for an end to the protectorate, the declaration was globally unsatisfactory since it did not grant Egypt full independence. Egyptian sovereignty was greatly restricted by the "reserved points" clause. This led to sustained pressure on the United Kingdom from Egyptian nationalists to renegotiate the relationship between the two countries, which finally occurred with the signing of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]].&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;
