The '''3rd century BC''' started the first day of [[300 BC]] and ended the last day of [[201 BC]]. It is considered part of the Classical [[era]], [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], or [[historical period]].

[[File:WarElephants.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Hannibal]] Crosses the Alps during the [[Second Punic War]]]]

In the [[Mediterranean]] the first few decades of this century were characterized by a balance of power between the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Hellenistic]] kingdoms in the east, and the great mercantile power of [[Carthage]] in the west. This balance was shattered when conflict arose between [[Carthage]] and the [[Roman Republic]]. In the following decades, the [[Carthaginian Republic]] was first humbled and then destroyed by the Romans in the first and second [[Punic]] wars. Following the [[Second Punic War]], Rome became the most important power in the western Mediterranean.

[[File:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Maurya Empire]] at the age of Ashoka. The empire stretched from [[Iran]] to [[Bangladesh]]/[[Assam]] and from [[Afghanistan]] to [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[South India]].]]

In [[India]], [[Ashoka]] ruled the [[Maurya Empire]]. The [[Early Pandyan Kingdom|Pandya]], [[early Cholas|Chola]] and [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]] dynasties of the classical age flourished in the [[ancient Tamil country]].

The [[Warring States]] period in [[China]] drew to a close, with [[Qin Shi Huang]] conquering other nation-states and establishing the short-lived [[Qin dynasty]], the first empire of China, which was followed in the same century by the long-lasting [[Han dynasty]]. The [[Proto–Three Kingdoms Period|Protohistoric Period]] began in the [[Korean peninsula]]. The [[Xiongnu]] was at the height of their power in [[Mongolia]].

The '''Acámbaro figures''' are about 33,000 small ceramic figurines allegedly found by Waldemar Julsrud in July 1944, in the Mexican city of [[Acámbaro]], [[Guanajuato]]. The figurines are said by some to resemble [[dinosaur]]s and are sometimes cited as [[anachronism]]s. Some [[Young-Earth creationism|young-Earth creationists]] have adduced the existence of figurines as credible evidence for the coexistence of dinosaurs and humans, in an attempt to cast doubt on scientific dating methods and potentially offer support for a literal interpretation of the [[Genesis creation narrative]].&lt;ref name="wtf"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Dinosaur Figurines Of Acambaro, Mexico | work = | publisher = The Interactive Bible | date = 2003-07-27 | url = http://www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks-acambaro.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2007-12-19 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071214113715/http://www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks-acambaro.htm| archivedate= 14 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is no known reliable evidence for the validity of the Acámbaro figures as actual ancient [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]; and many have questioned the motives of those who argue for their validity.&lt;ref name="Isaak2007b"&gt;Isaak, M. (2007). ''The Counter-Creationism Handbook.'' University of California Press, Berkeley, California. p. 362. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24926-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage= [[File:Muzeo Julsrud 13.JPG|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj1w9_U3Hi4 What in the World - The Disputed Pottery Collection of Waldemar Julsrud], 10:53, [[Penn Museum]]&lt;ref name="pennmuseum"&gt;{{cite web | title =WHAT IN THE WORLD - THE DISPUTED POTTERY COLLECTION OF WALDEMAR JULSRUD | work = | publisher =[[Penn Museum]] | date = 2010| url =https://www.penn.museum/collections/videos/video/1077 | accessdate =September 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The Acámbaro figures were uncovered by a German immigrant and hardware merchant named Waldemar Julsrud. According to Dennis Swift, a [[Young Earth creationism|young-Earth creationist]] and major proponent of the figures, Julsrud stumbled upon the figures while riding his horse and hired a local farmer to dig up the remaining figures, paying him for each figure he brought back. Eventually, the farmer and his assistants brought him over 32,000 figures which included representations of everything from the supposed dinosaurs to peoples from all over the world including [[Egyptians]], [[Sumer]]ians, and "bearded [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]".&lt;ref name="wtf"/&gt;
 
Archaeologist [[Charles C. Di Peso]] was working for the [[Amerind Foundation]], an anthropological organization dedicated to preserving [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture. Di Peso examined the figures and determined that they were not authentic, and had instead been produced by local modern-day farmers.&lt;ref name="DiPeso(1953a)"&gt;DiPeso, C.C. (1953). "The Clay Figurines of Acambaro, Guanajuato, Mexico". ''American Antiquity''. 18(4):388-389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiPeso(1953b)"&gt;DiPeso, C.C. (1953). "The Clay Monsters of Acambaro". ''Archaeology''. 6(2):111-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He concluded that the figurines were indeed fakes: their surfaces displayed no signs of age; no dirt was packed into their crevices; and though some figurines were broken, no pieces were missing and no broken surfaces were worn. Furthermore, the excavation’s stratigraphy clearly showed that the artifacts were placed in a recently dug hole filled with a mixture of the surrounding archaeological layers. DiPeso also learned that a local family had been making and selling these figurines to Julsrud for a peso apiece since 1944, presumably inspired by films shown at Acámbaro’s cinema, locally available comic books and newspapers, and accessible day trips to Mexico City’s Museo Nacional.&lt;ref name=pezatti&gt;Pezatti, Alex (2005). "[http://penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/47-3/Pezzati.pdf Mystery at Acámbaro, Mexico"]. ''Expedition Magazine''. 47(3):7-8. University of Pennsylvania Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Charles Hapgood]], pioneer of [[pole shift theory]], became one of the figures' most high profile and devout supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hapgood  | first = Charles  | authorlink = Charles Hapgood  | title = Mystery in Acambaro: Did Dinosaurs Survive Until Recently?  | publisher = Adventures Unlimited Press  | year = 2000  | pages = | isbn = 0-932813-76-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures continue to draw attention in the present day. They have been cited in some [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] books such as ''Atlantis Rising'' by David Lewis. Another young-Earth creationist, Don Patton, has emerged as one of their staunchest supporters. He has proposed some new lines of evidence, including the figure’s resemblance to the dinosaurs depicted in [[Robert T. Bakker|Robert Bakker]]’s book, ''Dinosaur Heresies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Blanton | first = John  | authorlink = | title = The Acambaro dinosaurs  | work = Newsletter of The North Texas Skeptics |volume = 13| issue= 10  | date = October 1999  | url = http://www.ntskeptics.org/1999/1999october/october1999.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-19 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071227132322/http://www.ntskeptics.org/1999/1999october/october1999.htm| archivedate= 27 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==

Attempts have been made to date the figures using [[thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence (TL) dating]]. The earliest results, from tests done when TL dating was in its infancy, suggested a date around 2500 BC.&lt;ref name=pezatti/&gt; However, later tests contradicted these findings. In 1976, Gary W. Carriveau and Mark C. Han attempted to date twenty Acámbaro figures using TL dating. They found that the figures had been fired at temperatures between 450&amp;nbsp;°C and 650&amp;nbsp;°C, which contradicted claims that these figures had been fired at temperatures too low for them to be accurately dated. However, all of the samples failed the "plateau test", which indicated that dates obtained for the Acámbaro figures using standard high-temperature TL dating techniques were unreliable and lacked any chronological significance. Based on the degree of signal regeneration found in remeasured samples, they estimated that the figures tested had been fired approximately 30 years prior to 1969.&lt;ref name="Carriveau and Han(1976)"&gt;Carriveau, G. W.; Han, M. C. (1976). "Thermoluminescent Dating and the Monsters of Acambaro". ''American Antiquity''. 41(4):497-500.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aimoin of Fleury''' ({{lang-la|Aimoinus (Annonius; Aemonius) Floriacensis}}; {{circa|960|1010}}), [[France|French]] chronicler, was born at [[Villefranche-de-Longchat]] about 960, and in early life entered the [[monastery]] of [[Fleury Abbey|Fleury]], where he became a monk and passed the greater part of his life. Between c. 980 and 985 Aimoin wrote about St. Benedict in Abbey of Fleury-sur-Loire. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aimoin&lt;/ref&gt;  His chief work is a ''Historia Francorum'', or ''Libri V. de Gestis Francorum'', which deals with the history of the [[Franks]] from the earliest times to 653, and was continued by other writers until the middle of the twelfth century. It was much in vogue during the [[Middle Ages]], but its historical value is now regarded as slight. It was edited by [[Georg Waitz|G. Waitz]] and published in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Scriptores'', Band xxvi (Hanover and Berlin, 1826–1892).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aimoin|volume=1|page=439}} Endote: See ''Histoire littéraire de la France'', tome vii. (Paris, 1865–1869).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1004 he also wrote a ''Vita Abbonis, abbatis Floriacensis'', the last of a series of lives of the [[abbot]]s of Fleury, all of which, except the life of [[Abbo of Fleury|Abbo]], have been lost.  This was published by [[Jean Mabillon|J. Mabillon]] in the ''[[Acta Sanctorum|Acta sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti]]'' (Paris, 1668–1701).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Aimoin's third work was the composition of books ii and iii of the ''Miracula sancti Benedicti'', the first book of which was written by another monk of Fleury named '''Adrevald'''. This also appears in the ''Acta sanctorum''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Bertha Haven Putnam''' (1872 &amp;ndash; February 26, 1960) was an American historian, specialising on the [[Judiciary|judicial]] and administrative history of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] England.

Putnam grew up in Philadelphia, the daughter of [[George Haven Putnam]], author and publisher, and son of the publisher [[George Palmer Putnam]]. She attended [[Bryn Mawr College]], and got her bachelor's degree in 1893. She later taught at the [[Brearley School]] in New York City, before getting her doctorate from [[Columbia University]] in 1908. She started teaching at [[Mount Holyoke College]] in 1908, and was made professor in 1924. Here she remained until her retirement in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings and Kimball, pp. 144-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Her career, from Bryn Mawr to Holyoke, ran parallel to that of [[Nellie Neilson]], a fellow medievalist.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings and Kimball.&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked closely with [[Eileen Power]] and [[Helen Cam]].&lt;ref&gt;Hastings and Kimball, pp. 157-8.&lt;/ref&gt; An attack of [[shingles]] left her partially blind in the late 1940s. Putnam died of [[arteriosclerosis]] in [[South Hadley]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her main focus was the office of the [[Justice of the Peace]], and how it developed from the [[Conservator of the Peace]] in the early- to mid-14th century. In particular she proved the importance of the [[Statute of Labourers]] in giving these officers the right to decide cases, and thereby establishing them as justices. The change was sanctioned by the Statute of Westminster of 1361.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings and Kimball, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of her main contentions, particularly that this process represented a radical devolution of judicial authority to the localities, have since been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Musson and Ormrod, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wessex 1982.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Westland Wessex]] helicopter delivers supplies at [[Ascension Island]] in May 1982|alt=A helicopter flies over the water with a load slung below. In the background is an island with a series of pyramid-shaped peaks.]]
The 1982 [[Falklands War|British military campaign to recapture]] the [[Falkland Islands]] depended on complex logistical arrangements. The logistical difficulties of operating {{convert|7000|nmi|mi km}} from home were formidable. The Argentine [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invasion of the Falkland Islands]] came at a time when the [[Royal Navy]]'s amphibious capability was being run down; but it still possessed two [[aircraft carrier]]s, {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|2}}, two  [[landing platform dock]] (LPD) ships, {{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}} and {{HMS|Intrepid|L11|2}}, and six  [[landing ship logistics]] (LSL) ships. To provide the necessary logistic support, the Royal Navy's ships were augmented by ships taken up from trade ([[STUFT]]).

The [[British Army]] and Royal Navy developed a base at [[Ascension Island]], a British territory in the mid-Atlantic {{convert|3700|nmi|mi km}} from the UK and {{convert|3300|nmi|mi km}} from the Falkland Islands. Although it had an airfield with an excellent runway, there was only a small [[hardstand]] area for parking aircraft and no parallel taxiways. There was an [[anchorage (maritime)|anchorage]], but no port facilities—just a lone [[jetty]]. Ascension was used as a convenient place for the amphibious ships to re-stow their equipment, and as a base for [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Hercules]] transport aircraft, which were modified by the addition of  auxiliary fuel tanks and [[aerial refuelling]] probes. With the support of [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]] tankers, these modifications allowed the transports to deliver priority supplies to the South Atlantic.

The [[3rd Commando Brigade]] [[Operation Sutton|landed]] at [[Ajax Bay]], [[Port San Carlos]] and [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] on [[East Falkland]], but struggled to build up its supplies as the Argentine air forces made [[Battle of San Carlos (1982)|repeated attacks on ships]] in Falkland Sound. {{SS|Atlantic Conveyor||6}} was struck by a missile, and sank with three [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] and six [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] helicopters still on board, along with their tools and spare parts, and other vital stores including tent accommodation. The loss of the helicopters on ''Atlantic Conveyor'' was a serious blow; it forced the 3rd Commando Brigade to make a [[loaded march]] across East Falkland. The Brigade Maintenance Area (BMA) was struck by an Argentine air attack on 27 May that destroyed hundreds of rounds of mortar and artillery ammunition. Forward Brigade Maintenance Areas (FBMAs) were established at [[Teal Inlet]] for the 3rd Commando Brigade and [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]] for the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]]. Some 500 rounds per gun were delivered to gun positions by helicopters to enable the [[artillery]] to support the attacks on the mountains ringing [[Port Stanley]]. The successful conclusion of these battles resulted in the surrender of the Argentine forces in the Falklands on 14 June.

==Background==
[[File:Falklands, Campaign, (Distances to bases) 1982.jpg|thumb|Key locations and the route taken by British forces during the Falklands War|alt=A map of the north and South Atlantic Ocians. Ascension Island is in the mid-Atlantic; the Falkland Islands are in the South Atlantic, near Argentina.]]
Tensions between Britain and Argentina over the disputed [[Falkland Islands]] (Malvinas) rose swiftly after Argentine scrap metal merchants and [[Argentina Marines]] raised the Argentine flag over [[South Georgia Island]] on 19 March 1982,{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=50–52}} and on 2 April, Argentine forces [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|occupied the Falkland Islands]].{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=4–11}} The British government had already taken some action on 29 March, ordering the submarines {{HMS|Spartan|S105|6}} and {{HMS|Splendid|S106|6}} to sail for the South Atlantic.{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=53}} ''Spartan'' left [[Gibraltar]] on 1 April, and ''Splendid''  sailed from [[Faslane]] the same day. A third submarine, {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} followed on 4 April.{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=67–68}}

The [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] (RFA) [[stores ship]] {{RFAux|Fort Austin|A386|6}} was despatched from the Western Mediterranean to replenish  the only British warship in the South Atlantic, the patrol vessel {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}}, which was down to its last three weeks' supplies. The [[replenishment oiler|tanker]] {{RFAux|Appleleaf|A79|6}}, which had left [[Curaçao]] bound for the United Kingdom with a full load of fuel, received orders on 27 March to divert to Gibraltar, embark stores there, and join ''Endurance'' and ''Fort Austin'' in the South Atlantic.{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=53}}

When intelligence was received in London on 31 March that the Falklands would be invaded on 2 April, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the [[Secretary of State for Defence]], [[John Nott]], instructed the [[First Sea Lord]], [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] Sir [[Henry Leach]], to ready a force to recapture the islands.{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=53}} The [[Commander-in-Chief Fleet]], [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] Sir [[John Fieldhouse]], who was based at [[Northwood Headquarters]], was placed in command of Task Force 317, with overall responsibility for this operation, codenamed Operation Corporate.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=29–30}} [[Air Marshal]] Sir [[John Curtiss]] was appointed air component commander,{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=64}} and Major General [[Jeremy Moore]], land component commander.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=207}}

[[Rear Admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear Admiral]] [[Sandy Woodward]] commanded the [[aircraft carrier]]  battle group (TG 317.8); [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Michael Clapp]],  the [[Commodore, Amphibious Warfare]], commanded the amphibious force (TG 317.0); and [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]], the landing force (TG 317.1).{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=29–30}} Thompson's force was built around his [[3rd Commando Brigade]], which had three battalions of the [[Royal Marines]] ([[40 Commando]], [[42 Commando]] and [[45 Commando]]),{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=32–35}} and supporting units including its own logistic support unit, the [[Commando Logistic Regiment]]. About 80 per cent of the Commando Logistic Regiment's men were Royal Marines; the rest came from the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]].{{sfn|Hellberg|2005|p=111}}

==Shipping==
===Amphibious===
On 2 April, orders went out to make the Royal Navy's two aircraft carriers, {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|2}}, ready to sail.{{sfn|Woodward|1992|p=73}} Both had been involved in exercises in February and March, and were at [[HMNB Portsmouth]] for six weeks' maintenance. Many of ''Hermes''{{'}} major systems had been dismantled for the maintenance work. ''Invincible'' was in a better state of readiness, but her crew were on leave. The Royal Navy's two [[landing platform dock]] (LPD) ships, {{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}} and {{HMS|Intrepid|L11|6}} were also at Portsmouth, where the former was acting as an officer training ship and the latter was being mothballed, having been [[paid off]]. She was hastily recommissioned, and her crew reassembled from their new postings.{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=65–68}} Each LPD carried four [[Landing Craft Utility]] (LCU) in its dock, and four of the smaller [[LCVP (United Kingdom)|Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel]] (LCVP) on [[davit]]s.{{sfn|Clapp|Southby-Tailyour|1997|p=21}}

The rest of the Royal Navy's amphibious capability consisted of six [[Round Table class landing ship logistics ship|Round Table class]] [[landing ship logistics]] (LSL) ships. Four were immediately available: {{RFAux|Sir Galahad|1966|6}} and {{RFAux|Sir Geraint|L3027|2}} were at [[HMNB Devonport]], while {{RFAux|Sir Lancelot|L3029|6}} and {{RFAux|Sir Percivale|L3036|2}} were at the [[Marchwood Military Port]]. The other two were further away: {{RFAux|Sir Tristram|L3505|6}} was in Belize, and could meet up with the fleet on its way south; but {{RFAux|Sir Bedivere|L3004|6}} was in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, and would not be immediately available. It was therefore decided to use the stores ship {{RFAux|Stromness|A344|6}}, which was also in reserve at Portsmouth, as an LPD in the initial stages, after which she would revert to her normal role.{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=65–68}} ''Stromness'' departed on 7 April with 358 Royal Marines and 7,500 rations on board.{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=72}}

[[File:Galahad82.jpg|thumb|left|{{RFAux|Sir Galahad|1966|6}} heading south in May 1982|alt=A grey ship with a helipad aft. It has "L3005" painted on the side in large letters.]]
As vital as they were, these ships were insufficient for the logistics needs of a task force operating {{convert|8000|mi}} from home. Civilian ships could be obtained by charter or by requisition; but there was no time to allow ships to complete the deliveries of their cargo or meet their existing passenger booking obligations. The British government therefore resorted to requisitioning, a practice last exercised during the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=9}}{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=54}} An [[Order in Council]] was issued on 4 April allowing any British ship to be requisitioned, along with anything on board.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=8}} Civilian ships acquired became known as ships taken up from trade ([[STUFT]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110075428/http://www.nickmessinger.co.uk/STUFT.pdf |url=http://www.nickmessinger.co.uk/STUFT.pdf |title=Ships Taken Up From Trade – STUFT |first=Nick |last=Messenger |date=January 1983 |publisher=Ministry of Defence |archive-date=10 November 2016 |access-date=19 November 2017 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Half were requisitioned; the rest were chartered.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=29}} Some companies, such as [[P&amp;O (company)|P&amp;O]], insisted on requisitioning, as it allowed them to break existing contracts.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=53}}

Government policy was that only British-flagged vessels could be requisitioned, and only British nationals could serve as crewmen. British crewmen were retained, and a 150 per cent bonus was paid to those who entered the South Atlantic,{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=28}} considerably more than the extra £1 per day paid to members of the armed services.{{sfn|Clapp|Southby-Tailyour|1997|p=60}} Among the RFA crews were some 400 Hong Kong Chinese, who were [[British Overseas Territories citizen]]s. Some protested that their contracts said nothing about service in a war zone, but the Ministry of Defence refuted this.&lt;ref name="Chinese"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=South China Morning Post |first=Peter |last=Simpson |title=The War Within |date=10 June 2007 |url=https://www.scmp.com/article/596179/war-within |access-date=9 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A declaration of active service brought everyone under the [[Naval Discipline Act 1957]].{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=15–16}} A senior naval officer was assigned to each ship,{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=54}} with authority to direct the ship's actions and movements, even if, in the opinion of the master, it might put the ship at risk.{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=15–16}}

Many modern ships are designed for maximum economy in performing a specific task, which limits their flexibility. The ferries that plied the English Channel, for example, did not have the capacity to store enough fresh water for a voyage to the South Atlantic. STUFT had to have a combination of range, endurance and [[sea-keeping]] qualities.{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=12–13}} The need for range meant that ships could not take on sea water as [[ballast]], making them less stable in the rough seas anticipated in the South Atlantic.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=28}} Only one vessel was taken up for every four inspected.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=29}}  Over the next few months, 54 ships were requisitioned from 33 owners.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=26}} During the Falklands War they carried {{convert|100000|LT}} of freight, 95 aircraft, 9,000 personnel, and  {{convert|400000|LT}} of fuel.{{sfn|Webb|2007|p=298}}

On 3 April it was decided to add the [[3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (3 Para) to Thompson's 3rd Commando Brigade. This ended plans for the amphibious force to carry the entire landing force. Even if troops were accommodated on the aircraft carriers, they could not carry what was now a 4,350-man force. Calculations indicated that capacity was short by 1,700 men, {{convert|150|LT}} of stores and 60 vehicles.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=51–53}} For a troop transport, an [[ocean liner]] was the best alternative, but there were few of these left. P&amp;O's {{convert|44807|grt|adj=on|lk=on}} {{SS|Canberra}} was chosen.{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=12–15}} She was on a cruise in the Mediterranean with a full complement of passengers and crew, but due to return to [[Southampton]] on 6 April.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=28}} Some 400 of her crew were Asian nationals, and therefore had to be disembarked,{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=54}} but her master, Captain D.

The [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] subsequently recommended further reinforcing the 3rd Commando Brigade with another battalion, the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (2 Para). This was approved by the [[War Cabinet]] on 15 April. To carry it, the  {{convert|12988|grt|adj=on}} ferry {{MV|Norland||6}} was requisitioned on 17 April. She was far from ideal, as her ramp could not be lowered to the height of the [[mexeflote]] landing rafts carried by the LSLs, but the choices of available ships were limited.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=195}}{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=171}}  For transporting vehicles, a [[roll-on/roll-off]] vessel was preferred, as unloading facilities were unavailable in the Falkland Islands. The {{convert|5463|grt|adj=on}} P&amp;O ferry MS ''Elk'' was therefore requisitioned. It took on 100 vehicles, 2,000 tons of ammunition, and several hundred tons of stores.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=53}} It was followed by the {{convert|4190|grt|adj=on}} MS ''Europic Ferry'', which was taken up on 19 April.{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=15, 172–173}} Cunard's {{convert|14946|grt|adj=on}} [[container ship]], {{SS|Atlantic Conveyor||6}} was requisitioned on 14 April and converted into an aircraft transport.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=30}}{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=15, 178–179}}

Soon after his appointment as land component commander on 9 April, Moore began to press for British Army's [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]] to be sent to the South Atlantic as well. Fieldhouse formally requested this on 27 April. The brigade had a strength of 3,961 men, and for 35 days' operations it required {{convert|1067|LT}} of ammunition, {{convert|1129|LT}} of stores, 205 vehicles and 19 helicopters. If the ships carrying the 3rd Commando Brigade were to be reused, even if the troops were flown to [[Ascension Island]] and embarked from there, they could not reach the Falkland Islands before the middle of June. It was therefore decided that the brigade would have to be carried in other ships. The War Cabinet only approved the despatch of the 5th Infantry Brigade on 2 May.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=207–211}} The [[Cunard Line]]'s {{convert|67140|grt|adj=on}} {{SS|Queen Elizabeth 2}} was taken up just 19 hours before she was due to depart for the Mediterranean with cruise passengers.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=30}}{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=15}}

To carry the 5th Infantry Brigade's vehicles and stores, two more roll-on/roll-off vessels were requisitioned, the {{convert|6455|grt|adj=on}} {{MS|Baltic Ferry||6}} and {{MS|Nordic Ferry||2}}.{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=15, 172–173}} ''Atlantic Conveyor''{{'}}s [[sister ship]], {{SS|Atlantic Causeway||6}}, was requisitioned for the same conversion to an aircraft transport on 4 May.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=30}}{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=15, 178–179}} They were joined by the helicopter support ship {{RFAux|Engadine|K08|6}}. ''Atlantic Causeway'' was loaded with vehicles and stores, requiring another vessel to carry the aircraft. It had also been decided to send another six RAF Harriers to augment the six already sent on ''Atlantic Conveyor''.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=211–212}}  [[RFA Argus (A135)|MV ''Contender Bezant'']], was requisitioned for conversion to an aircraft transport on 10 May, followed by [[RFA Reliant (A131)|''Astronomer'']] on 29 May.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=30}}

===Logistical===
Fuel was a critical requirement of the task force, and for political reasons could not be obtained from South America or South Africa. Countries in South America, even if sympathetic, felt unable to offer overt support in a conflict involving a neighbouring state, while South Africa was an international pariah at the time due to its system of [[apartheid]], and collaboration with its regime risked alienating other countries at a time when Britain needed all the support it could muster for its international diplomatic efforts. The nearest source of supply was [[Freetown]] in Sierra Leone, {{convert|4100|mi}} from the Falkland Islands. To carry the [[diesel fuel]] required by the [[gas turbine]]s of the warships and the [[fuel oil]] required by ''Hermes'' and some of the older RFA and STUFT, the fourteen RFA tankers were supplemented by fifteen requisitioned tankers.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=12}}

{{RFAux|Tidespring|A75|6}} and ''Appleleaf'' accompanied Woodward's force of ships that sailed from Gibraltar, while {{RFAux|Pearleaf|A77|6}} and {{RFAux|Olmeda|A124|2}} were detailed to accompany the force departing from the UK. {{RFAux|Blue Rover|A270|6}} was returning from Gibraltar to the UK; she was ordered to take on [[aviation fuel]] and [[petrol]] at Portsmouth. {{RFAux|Brambleleaf|A81|6}} was in the Indian Ocean, and was ordered to proceed to the South Atlantic via the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. {{RFAux|Tidepool|A76|6}} had been sold to Chile and was off the coast of Peru on its way there, but its government allowed it to be temporarily repossessed on 3 April.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=54}} The first two tankers to be chartered were [[British Petroleum]]'s {{convert|25905|grt|adj=on}} ''British Esk'' at [[Hamburg]] and {{convert|25000|grt|adj=on}} ''British Tay''  at [[Swansea]] on 5 April, followed by the {{convert|25498|grt|adj=on}} ''British Tamar'' on 7 April, and  {{convert|25651|grt|adj=on}} ''British Dart'' on 9 April.{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=52, 174–176}}

[[File:RFA Stromness DN-SC-87-05079.jpeg|thumb|left|{{RFAux|Stromness|A344|6}} in 1982|alt=A grey ship with a helipad aft]]
Although the Royal Navy ships in the task force were fitted with [[reverse osmosis]] systems for producing [[potable water]], many civilian ships were not, and some ships  needed more water than usual owing to their carrying additional passengers. The {{convert|31400|grt|adj=on}} SS ''Fort Toronto'' was chartered from [[CP Ships|Canadian Pacific]] for service as a water tanker. The supply of water while under way was simpler than fuel, as the hoses are lighter and the quantities involved are not as great.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=53}} The {{convert|6061|grt|adj=on}} North Sea oil rig support ship SS ''Stena Seaspread'' was taken up to act as a repair ship.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=15}} The [[Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service]] had one ocean-going [[tugboat]], {{RMAS|Typhoon|A95|6}}, but it was evident that more would be required, and three were requisitioned from the United Towing company: SS ''Salvageman'', ''Irishman'' and ''Yorkshireman''.{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=47}}

The Royal Navy had no hospital ships. {{ship|HMY|Britannia}} had been built to allow its conversion into a hospital ship, but she required special fuel oil, and had only a 200-bed capacity. Instead, the {{convert|16907|grt|adj=on}} P&amp;O liner {{SS|Uganda|1952|6}}, which was in the Mediterranean on an educational cruise with a thousand schoolchildren on board, was requisitioned, and modified to become a hospital ship. A team of 135 medical personnel was assigned, which included members of [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service]] (QARNNS).{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=75}} This was the first time that QARNNS personnel had been deployed afloat since the [[Korean War]]. They brought a packaged 250-bed portable hospital and 90 tons of medical supplies with them.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=134}} Beds were provided for 20 intensive care patients and 94 medium dependency patients. Up to 940 low dependency patients could be accommodated in dormitories.{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=131–132}} Three {{sclass-|Hecla|survey vessel|1}}s, {{HMS|Hecla|A133|6}}, {{HMS|Herald|H138|2}} and {{HMS|Hydra|A144|2}}, became ambulance ships.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=54}}

Hospital ships were exempt from attack under the [[Geneva Conventions]], but they also require that patients not be returned directly to the battlefield after treatment. Due to the distances involved, this meant that treatment on ''Uganda'' would involve a prolonged absence, even those with relatively minor injuries that were anticipated such as [[trench foot]]. Additional medical facilities were therefore established elsewhere in the task force.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=128}} Surgical teams were also embarked on ''Hermes'', ''Fearless'' and ''Canberra''.{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=76}} In addition to the British Army medical staff embarked, there were 425 Royal Navy medical staff with the task force, including 103 doctors. Some 40 Royal Naval Reserve doctors were called up for service in the UK to replace those headed for the South Atlantic.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=127}} The departure of so many trained personnel led to the suspension of nursing training at the [[Royal Hospital Haslar|Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar]], and [[Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse]].{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=76}} The Army Blood Supply Depot issued 800 units to the task force, and more units were obtained from a blood donation drive on ''Canberra''.{{sfn|Tustin|1984b|p=400}}

==Dockyards==
It was initially hoped that ships could be loaded and converted at commercial shipyards, but these were soon overwhelmed by the requirements for skilled labour and specialised facilities, and the burden fell on the [[Royal Navy Dockyard]]s at Portsmouth, Devonport, [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]], [[Portland Harbour|Portland]], [[Rosyth Dockyard|Rosyth]] and [[Gibdock|Gibraltar]]. These had been subject to cutbacks; redundancy notices had been issued at Portsmouth on 2 April,{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=29}} and Chatham and Gibraltar had been slated for closure.{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=67, 73}} Along with Marchwood, the home of the Army's [[17 Port and Maritime Regiment RLC|17 Port Regiment]] and the home base of the six LSLs, they were not bound by legal limits on the handling of explosives. Marchwood had only a single jetty, capable of accepting two ships, and could not accept deep draft vessels.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=31}} Most major ship conversions were carried out at Devonport. Portsmouth carried out seven major conversions, including ''Norland'', and fourteen minor ones, of which ten were tankers. These were the simplest conversions, as all they involved was installing communications equipment and [[replenishment at sea]] (RAS) systems to allow the tankers to supply fuel over the stern using a long, buoyant hose. Under normal circumstances they could pump {{convert|450|LT}} per hour, whereas an RFA tanker could refuel warships running alongside with transfer rates of {{convert|600|LT}} per hour.{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=31, 52–53}}

Other ships required major alterations. The conversion of ''Atlantic Conveyor'' at Devonport required the removal of 500 tie-down points for containers from her deck, adding a landing pad for helicopters and [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]]s, installing UHF radio equipment and satellite communications, providing accommodation for 122 men, installing a [[liquid oxygen]] tank, cutting additional hatches, and modifying the stern doors.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=31}} Similar conversions were undertaken on ''Atlantic Causeway'', ''Contender Bezant'' and ''Astronomer''.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=30}}{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=15, 178–179}} The experience with ''Atlantic Conveyor'' allowed these to be converted far more quickly.{{sfn|Bowie|1985|p=11}} The conversion of ''Uganda'' to a hospital ship was carried out at Gibraltar in 65 hours. Minesweepers were converted at Rosyth.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=33}} Some 17 ships were fitted with helicopter landing pads; on ''Canberra'' and ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', the area around the swimming pool was used, as it had been designed to hold the weight of {{convert|70|to|100|LT}} of water. On {{RMS|St Helena|1963|6}} and the cable ship ''Iris'' there was insufficient room for the flight deck and it had to be cantilevered over the stern. All ships fitted to operate helicopters also had to have communications, lighting and glide path indicators.{{sfn|Villar|1984|pp=20–22}}

[[File:BAC Rapier fielded.png|thumb|left|A [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier missile]] system|alt=A two-wheeled trailer with four missiles on it. It has a radar dome, and a jerry can is attached to the trailer.]]
The Royal Marines normally kept war reserves both afloat and ashore, but the floating reserve was on ''Sir Geraint'', and had just been unloaded for a routine transfer to another LSL. These were soon reloaded. A request to the Army for assistance for the Commando Logistic Regiment in moving stores from the depots was met by 150 trucks on the first day; 1,500 trucks would ultimately be used. The depots despatched one million operational rations and twelve million ordinary meals. They also supplied {{convert|10000|LT}} of ammunition, {{convert|1260|LT}} of fuel, and {{convert|3880|LT}} of stores. Eventually, {{convert|38000|LT}} would be moved through to the ports.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=34–35}} Good weather at Devonport and Portsmouth permitted loading to be carried out in the open without the danger of perishable stores being damaged by rain.{{sfn|Villar|1984|p=29}}

Ships were not [[combat loading|combat loaded]]—loaded in such a way that the weapons, ammunition, equipment and stores that the embarked troops would require on landing were immediately accessible. Most units sent critical equipment to the ports first, and this then became the first equipment loaded, and the last that could be unloaded. ''Baltic Ferry'' had munitions stored deep in her holds that could only be retrieved by removing all the other cargo.{{sfn|Valovcin|1992|pp=8–9}} Most of the 3rd Commando Brigade's ammunition, about {{convert|2000|LT}} of it, was loaded on ''Elk'', making that vessel a particularly vulnerable target.{{sfn|Badsey|2014|p=109}}

Wheeled vehicles were not expected to be able to traverse the islands, so most were left behind. The 3rd Commando Brigade did take 54 of the Commando Logistic Regiment's 82 4-ton prime movers, ten of its fifteen fuel trucks, and nine of its forklifts.{{sfn|Hellberg|2005|pp=111–112}} To make up for the wheeled vehicles, the 3rd Commando Brigade took 75 [[Bv202]] tracked vehicles. These were fetched from Scotland by [[British Rail]], the only use of rail during the initial deployment,{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=37–38}} because British Rail required seven days notice to reposition its rolling stock.{{sfn|Tustin|1984a|p=296}}  Some 44 special trains were hired in the second week.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=53}} All vehicles were loaded fully fuelled with two full {{convert|20|l|Impgal|adj=on}} [[jerry can]]s, a practice normally prohibited as a fire hazard.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=37–38}} As it turned out, four-wheel drive vehicles were able to operate on the islands. The Commando Logistic Regiment was missing [[383 Commando Petroleum Troop RLC|383 Commando Petroleum Troop]], as this was made up of reservists, who were not called up.{{sfn|Badsey|2014|pp=111–112}}{{sfn|Badsey|2014|pp=111–112}} Leaving personnel behind reduced the strength of the Commando Logistic Regiment from its normal peacetime strength of over 600 to just 346. The only supplement it received was three Surgical Support Teams.{{sfn|Hellberg|2005|p=111}} The 3rd Commando Brigade's air defences were bolstered by the addition of [[T Battery (Shah Sujah's Troop) Royal Artillery]], armed with twelve [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier missile]] launchers. The logistical implications of deploying and maintaining the battery in the field were not fully appreciated.{{sfn|Thompson|1985|p=12}}{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=39}}

==Ascension==
The task force headed for Ascension Island, a British territory in the mid-Atlantic {{convert|3700|nmi}} from the UK and {{convert|3300|nmi}} from the Falkland Islands.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=60–63}}{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=62–63}} Parts of the island were leased by the US under a 1956 treaty which expired on 20 July 1975, but continued on an annual basis until either government announced its intention to terminate. Neither had done so by 1982. A 1962 exchange of notes obliged the US to provide "logistic, administrative or operating facilities at the airfield" for use by UK military aircraft.{{sfn|McQueen|2008|pp=6–7}} Ascension had about a thousand inhabitants, all contractors or employees, or the family members of contractors or employees, of British or American companies that included [[Cable &amp; Wireless]], the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) and the US [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=60–63}}{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=62–63}} There were about 200 schoolchildren on the island, who were obliged to leave at age 18.{{sfn|Hore|2005|p=217}} Although considered a United States Air Force (USAF) base, the US military garrison consisted of just one man, the base commander,{{sfn|McQueen|2008|pp=6–7}} Lieutenant Colonel William D. Bryden.{{sfn|McQueen|2008|pp=73–74}}

[[Wideawake Airfield]] was built on the island by the US during the [[Second World War]]. The runway was extended to {{convert|10000|ft}} in 1966 by the USAF to meet the demands of the [[Eastern Test Range]], and the airfield operated on behalf of the US government by Pan Am.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=60–63}}{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=62–63}} Although it had an excellent runway, there was only a small [[hardstand]] area for parking aircraft, and no parallel taxiways.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=60–63}}{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=62–63}} In the year prior to April 1982, it handled an average of 24.4 aircraft arrivals per month.{{sfn|McQueen|2008|pp=73–74}} Ascension had an [[anchorage (maritime)|anchorage]], but no port facilities—just a lone [[jetty]].{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=60–63}}{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=62–63}} The island was resupplied on a regular basis by a charter flight, which brought fresh produce, and a freighter, {{RMS|St Helena|1963|6}}. When the Falklands War broke out, ''St Helena'' was due and the charter flight had just departed. The island was therefore fortuitously well-stocked.{{sfn|McQueen|2008|pp=6–7}} There were two shops on the island, run by [[NAAFI]] under contract. As such they looked like NAAFI stores, but charged much higher prices. At first these were open to service personnel, but as stocks quickly became low they were placed off limits to them. The [[Expeditionary Forces Institute]] (EFI) then established a third shop, exclusively for service personnel. After some delay, space was made available for a weekly supply run for the civilians. Their morale plummeted when it was announced that the Ministry of Defence had chartered ''St Helena'', their only means shipping baggage, receiving sea mail, and returning to [[St Helena]], which had no airport. [[RFA Diligence (A132)|MV ''Stena Inspector'']] and {{HMS|Dumbarton Castle|P265|6}} had to be diverted from operational tasks to perform these duties.{{sfn|Hore|2005|p=223}}

A dozen RAF [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] transports flew to Ascension via Gibraltar and Dakar on 3 April, bringing stores and RAF and Royal Navy personnel to establish a base on Ascension.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=21}} Royal Navy [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Robert McQueen was appointed to command the British Forces Support Unit (BFSU) on Ascension,{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=60–63}} and arrived on 8 April.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=64}} The BFSU ballooned to over 800 personnel in the first three weeks. It began operating [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King]] and [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=62–63}}
Aviation fuel storage facilities on Ascension were controlled by the United States. On 13 April, the US agreed that the British forces could use {{convert|950000|USgal|l}} of the  {{convert|12.5|e6USgal|l}} stored on the island. Some {{convert|250000|USgal|l}} of this allocation was consumed on 19 April, and just {{convert|12000|USgal|l}} remained on 25 April when a supply tanker with  {{convert|2.4|e6USgal|l}} commenced replenishment. At this point, the US released its reserve stocks for British use.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=62–63}} Fuel was discharged from tankers through a floating pipeline to an American fuel farm. It then needed to be transported {{convert|3.5|mi}} to Wideawake Airfield. Tanker trucks found the island's steep and rough road heavy going.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=72}} The compacted volcanic rock used to surface the roads was abrasive, and tyres soon wore out. New sets had to be flown in.{{sfn|White|2012|p=166}} Sappers of 1 Troop, 51 Field Squadron, [[Royal Engineers]], built a pipeline to connect the fuel farm with the storage tanks at the airfield. Meanwhile, 12 Petroleum Operations Section, [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], had taken over management of the fuel farm. Fuel storage at Wideawake Airfield was increased by {{convert|180000|USgal|l}} by the addition of {{convert|30000|USgal|l|adj=on}} [[fuel bladder]]s.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=72}}

The RAF presence sharply increased after it was decided to use Ascension as a base for operations. Two [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]] [[maritime patrol aircraft]] arrived on 5 April. These were followed by seventeen [[Handley Page Victor]] [[aerial refuelling tanker]]s and three [[Avro Vulcan]] bombers,{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=91}} which conducted raids on the Falkland Islands as part of [[Operation Black Buck]].{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=277–283}} The first five Victor tankers deployed to Ascension on 18 April, followed by four more the next day. Six more deployed by the end of the month, bringing the Victor tanker force to fourteen, since one had returned to their base at [[RAF Marham]] on 26 April. Each was refuelled by another Victor before leaving UK airspace. The station commander at Marham, [[Group Captain]] J. S. B. Price, became the senior RAF officer at Ascension. [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] D. W. Maurice-Jones assumed command of the Victor detachment until 22 April, when he was relieved by Wing Commander A. W. Bowman, the commander of [[No. 57 Squadron RAF]].{{sfn|Burden|Draper|Rough|Smith|1986|pp=393–394}} 

The number of personnel on the island increased to about one thousand, of whom around 120 were Navy, 60 were British Army, and 800 were RAF.{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=89}} This exceeded the capacity of the island's water supply, and McQueen instituted draconian measures to limit the number of personnel on Ascension Island, in some cases sending people back on the planes they arrived on.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=70}} In early May, the USAF flew in fourteen planeloads of portable accommodation in the form of 31 twelve-man living units. Each was self-contained, with its own air-conditioning, bunks, showers and toilets. They were erected in five days by British and American personnel. The Army's [[30 Signal Regiment]] established direct telephone circuits to the UK, and its 2 Postal Regiment provided mail and courier services. By June, some 20,000 mailbags had passed through Ascension. A detachment of 9 Ordnance Battalion established laundry facilities in a disused laundry. Service cooks from all three services prepared a thousand meals per day through three field kitchens.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=72–73}} Intelligence sources warned of a possible Argentine attack on Ascension, perhaps using special forces and a long-range civilian airliner like a [[Boeing 707]]. Concerns about the vulnerability of the base led to three RAF Harriers being assigned for air defence on 10 May. These were replaced by [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s on 24 May.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=65–67}}

''Hermes'' reached Ascension on 16 April, and ''Fearless'', ''Stromness'' and the five LSLs the following day. ''Canberra'' and ''Elk'' arrived on 20 April, having refuelled at Freetown.{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=89}}{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=73}} By this time, cargo planes were arriving at Wideawake Airfield at a rate of eight per day, and {{convert|1500|LT}} of supplies had arrived, a third of which were earmarked for the 3rd Commando Brigade. Stores were difficult to identify, as many were poorly labelled, making it difficult to distinguish real ammunition from training ammunition. When cargo was not properly logged on arrival, it became difficult to know whether or not an item had been delivered. There was no security at the airfield, so goods were subject to [[pilferage]].{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=74–76}} D Squadron, [[Special Air Service|22 Special Air Service Regiment]], helped themselves to special ammunition and weapons belonging to the 3rd Commando Brigade, which they thought were just lying around.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=263}}

[[File:Vulcan bomber 18 May 1982.JPG|thumb|left|An [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber over Ascension Island on 18 May 1982|alt=A delta-winged aircraft silhouetted against the sky. It has its landing wheels down.]]
The amphibious force took the opportunity to re-stow its equipment. This took eleven days. Having not yet refuelled, ''Fearless'' rode too high in the water, and was unable to launch its LCUs, so the burden of the effort initially had to be carried by helicopters. Two Wessexes, three Sea Kings and a [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] supported the effort. Shortages of lifting gear and [[cargo net]]s hampered the effort, as did the haphazard original stowage of stores. In some cases, cargo had shifted during the voyage to Ascension. Some 138 Wessex, 40 Chinook and 40 Sea King sorties were flown on a single day. The LSLs ''Sir Galahad'' and ''Sir Percivale'' were stocked with two days' supply of ammunition, fuel and rations. Four more days' supply was stowed on ''Stromness'', and sixteen on ''Elk''. Units were issued with supplies and equipment they would require for an amphibious assault.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=76–77}} Meanwhile, ''Intrepid'', ''Atlantic Conveyor'', ''Norland'' and ''Europic Ferry'' departed the UK on 25 and 26 April, and ''Sir Bedivere'', which reached Marchwood on 25 April, sailed for Ascension on 27 April.{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=92}} The five LSLs, carrying most of the Commando Logistic Regiment, weighed anchor and set out for the Falkland Islands on 1 May, along with ''Pearleaf'' and escorted by the [[frigate]] {{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}}. ''Norland'' arrived at Ascension on the morning of 7 May, and departed for the Falklands that evening. ''Canberra'', ''Tidepool'' and ''Elk'' had left the previous day, and the last ship, the LPD ''Intrepid'', departed Ascension on 8 May.{{sfn|Clapp|Southby-Tailyour|1997|pp=121–123}}

To allow ships to be resupplied by air when operating in the South Atlantic, modifications were made to the Hercules, which normally had a range of about {{convert|2000|mi}}. At [[RAF Lyneham]], Hercules transports were fitted with pairs of  {{convert|825|Impgal|l|adj=on}} auxiliary fuel tanks, thereby extending their range by three or four hours. Adding four tanks increased the range further still, but reduced the cargo carrying capacity by 75 per cent. These modified Hercules became known as LR2 and LR4 variants, depending on how many auxiliary tanks had been installed. They were also modified to allow for [[aerial refuelling]] by the addition of refuelling probes taken from Vulcan bombers.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=66–69}} In the search for refuelling probes, they were taken from Vulcans at the [[Royal Air Force Museum London]], [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]], [[Castle Air Museum]] in [[California]], and the [[Strategic Air Command &amp; Aerospace Museum]] in [[Nebraska]].{{sfn|White|2012|pp=136–137}} The Hercules were the first propeller-driven aircraft to be refuelled by Victor tankers. The difference in the speeds required skilful flying. The Victor would approach the Hercules from above and aft at {{convert|23000|ft}}. The Hercules would then descend at {{convert|500|ft}} per minute. At full throttle, this allowed the Hercules to reach {{convert|230|to|240|kn|kph}}, the minimum speed of the Victor. Refuelling took about 15 minutes, by which time they would have descended to {{convert|8000|ft}}, but occasionally it took longer and they descended as low as {{convert|2000|ft}}.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=66–69}}

Part of 47 Air Despatch Squadron, [[Royal Corps of Transport]], went to Ascension on ''Fearless''. They prepared their first packages for [[airdrop]]ping on 19 April, of high priority supplies for {{HMS|Alacrity|F174|6}} and ''Invincible''. The first LR2 Hercules arrived at Wideawake Airfield on 12 May, and four days later a 24-hour, {{convert|6300|nmi|km|adj=on}} flight delivered {{convert|1000|lb}} of supplies to ''Antelope''. A flight to the Falkland Islands would take 28 hours, so two crews were needed, and required five Victor tankers for aerial refuelling. McQueen tried to enforce a policy that airdrop loads be rigged in the UK to save space at Ascension, but was overruled by Fieldhouse. By 1 June, 47 Air Despatch Squadron had prepared 47 loads totalling {{convert|163|LT}}, with high priority items delivered within 40 hours of the initial request.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=66–69}} Airdrop missions mounted from Ascension were given girls' names, in ascending alphabetical order. After "Zara" was flown on 9 June, the sequence started again with "Alison" the following day. While most airdrops were at sea, some were made to units in the Falkland Islands.{{sfn|Burden|Draper|Rough|Smith|1986|pp=407–408}} Those at sea were made with the stores in waterproof containers which were retrieved by the ships' boats.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=101–102, 236}} Occasionally personnel were also dropped. In the "Ursula" mission on 1 June, Lieutenant Colonel David Chaundler, a replacement commander for 2 Para, parachuted into the sea and was plucked from the water by a boat from the frigate {{HMS|Penelope|F127|6}}.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=172–173}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://soundcloud.com/historyhit/the-falklands-airdrop-ursula |title=The Falklands Airdrop Ursula (Part 1) |author= History Hit Podcast Network |date=1 June 2018|access-date=6 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landing===
The plan for an amphibious landing in the Falkland Islands, codenamed [[Operation Sutton]],{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=194}} called for units to land from the ships in which they had sailed,{{sfn|Clapp|Southby-Tailyour|1997|p=151}} which meant that 40 Commando, 42 Commando and 3 Para would land from ''Canberra'';{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=461}} but Fieldhouse became nervous about risking 2,000 men on one ship.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=427–428}} On 18 May, Clapp received orders for different battalions to be carried on separate ships.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=461}} Unusually calm seas on 19 May allowed this cross-decking to be carried out by LCUs and LCVPs from ''Fearless'' and ''Intrepid'', with 40 Commando transferred to the former, and 3 Para to the latter. Both LPDs were seriously overloaded, and, unlike ''Canberra'', did not have enough life rafts for everyone. After sunset an [[846 Naval Air Squadron]] Sea King from ''Hermes'' transferring troops of D Squadron, 22 Special Air Service Regiment, to ''Intrepid'' crashed into the ocean. ''Intrepid''{{'}}s LCVPs rescued eight men, but 22 others were lost.{{sfn|Clapp|Southby-Tailyour|1997|pp=152–154}}{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=171–172}}

Another change was that the Commando Logistic Regiment wanted the LSLs beached so they could be quickly unloaded. Clapp demurred. If done improperly, this could damage the ship. For this reason, peacetime financial restraints had prevented the LSL captains from practising this manoeuvre. Clapp ruled that the LSLs would discharge onto mexeflotes and landing craft through the stern doors. The LSLs had been loaded with the most urgently required stores in the bow, where they could be accessed first, but now the order needed to be changed. The double-handling required meant that unloading would be slower than planned.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=97–98}}

The logistics plan called for the support elements of the combat units, known as the B Echelons, to remain afloat, along with the entire Commando Logistic Regiment. After the beachhead was secured, the B Echelons would join their units. Lieutenant Colonel Ivar Hellberg, the commander of the Commando Logistic Regiment, and Major Gerry Wells-Cole, the 3rd Commando Brigade's Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DAA &amp; QMG), would select a Brigade Maintenance Area (BMA) site near Ajax Bay to be run by the Commando Logistic Regiment. Engineers would establish a refuelling point for Harriers and helicopters, and establish water points.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=95–97}}

Hellberg and Wells-Cole planned to use a "pull" system whereby unit quartermasters would request supplies that they needed. There would be no equipment repair facilities ashore; the Commando Logistic Regiment's Workshop Squadron would remain afloat, with detachments going ashore temporarily to retrieve or repair equipment as necessary.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=95–97}} Medical support was supplied by No. 1 Medical Troop on ''Sir Galahad'', the Parachute Clearing Troop of the [[16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance]] on ''Norland'', and No. 3 Medical Troop, No. 2 Surgical Support Team and the Commando Logistic Regiment's Medical Squadron on ''Canberra''. After the beachhead was secure, No. 1 Medical Troop and the Parachute Clearing Troop would establish a field dressing station in the BMA. Casualties could be flown to ''Uganda'', and then taken to Montevideo by {{HMS|Hecate|A137|6}}, ''Hydra''  and ''Hecla'',  from whence they would be flown back to the UK via Ascension. The dead would be buried in the BMA or at sea.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=95–97}}
 
The amphibious force entered [[Falkland Sound]] shortly after midnight local time on 21 May, delayed by mists and navigational difficulties. One of ''Fearless''{{'}}s ballast pumps broke down, slowing the start of dock operations. Four LCUs from ''Intrepid'' collected  2 Para from ''Norland'', while 40 Commando boarded four LCVPs and four LCUs; the LCVPs were needed because two of its LCUs were carrying a [[FV101 Scorpion]] and a [[FV107 Scimitar]]. 2 Para was slow boarding the LCUs, as this had not been practised, and one man suffered a crushed pelvis when he fell between the ship and an LCU. The various mishaps caused [[H-hour]] to be postponed by an hour. Guided by Major [[Ewen Southby-Tailyour]], they landed at [[San Carlos Water]], (Blue Beach) at 03:30. They then secured the high ground of the [[Sussex Mountains]], establishing a [[reverse slope defence]]. Meanwhile the landing craft returned to take 45 Commando from ''Intrepid'' and ''Stromness'' to [[Ajax Bay]] (Red Beach), and 3 Para from ''Intrepid'' to [[Port San Carlos]] (Green Beach). 42 Commando remained on ''Canberra'' as a reserve. Delays in landing the first wave meant that the second was about two hours late, with 3 Para landing at 07:30.{{sfn|Thompson|1985|pp=55–60}}{{sfn|Gardiner|2012|p=69}}

===Build-up===
Daylight allowed helicopter operations to begin. On 21 May, helicopters carried 288 loads, moving 520 personnel and {{convert|220|LT}} of stores from 11 ships to 21 sites. STUFT were unloaded at a rate of {{convert|20|LT}} per hour, and the LSLs could be unloaded at {{convert|90|LT}} per hour, the lesson being that STUFT were a poor substitute for purpose-built amphibious vessels.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=120}} Priority was given to moving the six [[L118 light gun]]s of 79 Commando Battery, [[29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery]], ashore. Moving a battery with 500 rounds per gun required 85 Sea King sorties. The next priority was to position the Rapiers of T battery, but owing to the delays in the landing, the Rapier sites were not secured until around midday. Generally located on hilltops where there were no roads or tracks, the Rapiers had to be sited by helicopter. If they had to be moved, whether yards or miles, another helicopter sortie was called for. No one knew for certain what the effect of seven weeks' sea voyage would be on the equipment, but the need for air defence was obvious, as the Argentine air forces made [[Battle of San Carlos (1982)|repeated attacks on ships]] in Falkland Sound.{{sfn|Thompson|1985|pp=61–68}} Two Gazelle helicopters were lost.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=108}}

[[File:HMS Fearless, San Carlos, 1982.JPG|thumb|left|{{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}} at San Carlos in 1982|alt=A warship at anchor. In the background is a flat, treeless landscape.]]
Of the seven escorts, five, {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, {{HMS|Ardent|F184|2}}, {{HMS|Argonaut|F56|2}}, {{HMS|Brilliant|F90|2}} and {{HMS|Broadsword|F88|2}}, were hit; only  {{HMS|Plymouth|F126|6}} and {{HMS|Yarmouth|F101|2}} were unscathed. Of those hit, only ''Broadsword'' was fully capable of continuing the fight, while ''Ardent'' was ablaze and sinking.{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=196–198}} Clapp decided that the sound was too dangerous for STUFT, and ordered that ''Canberra'', ''Norland'' and ''Europic Ferry'' leave Falkland Sound by midnight.{{sfn|Clapp|Southby-Tailyour|1997|p=185}} The LSLs remained, but on 23 May Argentine bombs found ''Sir Bedivere'', ''Sir Galahad'' and ''Sir Lancelot''. None of those that struck the LSLs exploded. Damage to ''Sir Bedivere'' was minor, but ''Sir Galahad'' was set on fire and beached, and was put out of action for a week.  Fires started on ''Sir Lancelot'', which put it out of action until 7 June—although in the meantime she acted as an accommodation ship and helicopter refuelling station.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=111–114}}{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=216}} Clapp decided that the remaining stores had to be landed as quickly as possible. Inevitably, some stores that were neither requested nor required were landed.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=114–115}}

This disrupted the logistics plan. 42 Commando came ashore at Green Beach by LCU, but the B Echelons remained on ''Canberra'', and the assault troops had left rucksacks, parkas, sleeping and cooking gear, and spare clothing behind. ''Canberra'' and ''Norland''  also took 90,000 rations with them.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=109–111}} The BMA was far from ideal. There was a landing ramp where forklifts could unload landing craft, but unusable rocky ground limited the area available to about a third of what was really required to properly disperse the stores, and the only cover was a disused refrigeration plant on the shore of Ajax Bay, which had been taken over by the hospital.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=111–114}}

Commander [[Rick Jolly]] brought No. 2 Surgical Support Team and the Headquarters of the Commando Logistic Regiment's Medical Squadron ashore from ''Canberra''. No. 1 Medical Troop disembarked from ''Sir Galahad'', and the Parachute Clearing Troop had already come ashore from ''Norland''. With these units he set up a field hospital in the refrigeration plant. They decided not to paint a Red Cross on the building, as it was close to the ordnance stores, and Argentina was not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions.{{sfn|Jolly|1983|pp=48–53}} A sign painted over the entrance proclaimed it to be "The Red and Green Life Machine", alluding to the colour of the paratroopers' and commandos' berets.{{sfn|Jolly|1983|p=97}} A "Water Heater, Field Kitchen, Portable" was the sole source of hot water for the surgical team at Ajax Bay. It was loaned from an American unit for a crate of beer, the British kit they were supposed to use never made it ashore.{{sfn|Jolly|1983|pp=93–94}}  Of 1,205 men treated, including 310 who required major surgery, three died.{{sfn|Tustin|1984b|p=409}}

''Atlantic Conveyor'' was struck by an [[Exocet]] [[anti-ship missile]] on the afternoon of 25 May and set ablaze. Although she remained afloat for several days, nothing could be salvaged. She was the most serious loss of the campaign. Twelve of those on board died, but 150 were rescued.{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=228–230}} Of the aircraft she had brought to the South Atlantic, the Harriers of [[No. 1 Squadron RAF]] had already been transferred to ''Hermes'',{{sfn|Pook|2007|p=35}} a Wessex of [[848 Naval Air Squadron]] had already flown ashore, and a Chinook of [[No. 18 Squadron RAF]] was in the air at the time. The rest, three Chinook and six Wessex helicopters, were lost.{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=228–230}}

The [[Bravo November|lone surviving Chinook]] landed on ''Hermes''. It spent the night there, arrived at San Carlos the next day, and was made available for missions on 29 May. The Chinook arrived with two aircrews, and a maintenance detachment, but they had no tools, spare parts or documentation, all of which were lost with ''Atlantic Conveyor''. Somehow, it went on to fly 109 hours without servicing, carrying 1,500 troops, 95 casualties, 650 Argentine [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) and {{convert|550|t|LT|order=flip}} of cargo. At one point it carried 81 paratroops in a single load, and then returned to fetch another 75, and it survived being accidentally flown into the sea one night during a snowstorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/news/royalairforcech47chinookbravonovember.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321040100/https://www.raf.mod.uk/news/royalairforcech47chinookbravonovember.cfm |archive-date=21 March 2017 |dead-url=yes |title=Royal Air Force CH47 Chinook 'Bravo November' |publisher=Royal Air Force |access-date=18 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=278}}

In addition to the helicopters, ''Atlantic Conveyor'' took with her four tent camps, complete with field kitchens and sanitary facilities, which would have accommodated 4,500 personnel. Another serious loss was a portable fuelling system and six {{convert|10|LT|adj=on}} fuel tanks. Material for building an airstrip at Port San Carlos also went down,{{sfn|Brown|1987|pp=228–230}}  but [[59 Independent Commando Squadron Royal Engineers]] managed to build it anyway, using matting earmarked for repairing [[Port Stanley Airport]].{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=164}}{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=279}} All ships were unloaded by 27 May, leaving only the two damaged LSLs at San Carlos.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=486}}

==Over the mountains==
===3rd Commando Brigade===
North east of the Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) that the British government had declared around the Falkland Islands, the Royal Navy designated a Tug, Repair and Logistics Area (TRALA) where ships could receive and transfer supplies, and conduct repairs of battle damage under the protection of the carrier battle group. Hercules airdrops were made to ships there.{{sfn|Privratsky|1986|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=216}} Ships were now held in the TRALA, from whence it took about 20 hours to reach San Carlos. Their captains preferred to navigate Falkland Sound by night, allowing them to be unloaded by day, which suited the Commando Logistic Regiment. Working around the clock was inadvisable, for there were no relief crews for the landing craft or helicopters.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=114–115}} Only four Sea Kings had night vision equipment, allowing them to operate at night. These were reserved for night operations. To allow the crews to rest, and necessary aircraft maintenance to be performed, they were not employed during the day. One Sea King was permanently assigned to support of the Rapier battery. This left six Sea Kings, five Wessexes and the Chinook available for logistical and tactical missions.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=274}} Requested supplies took at least two days to fetch from the TRALA.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=114–115}} Hellberg visited Clapp on ''Fearless'' each night and presented a list of required ships. Clapp would then signal Woodward and ask for them; but for operational reasons a requested ship might not arrive, or a substitute might be sent containing none of the required stores.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=272–273}} The Ordnance Squadron of the Commando Logistic Regiment had compiled lists of what was on board each ship, but lacked the manpower to maintain teams on all the supply ships. Goods became damaged from improper storage or handling, or were pilfered, and the contents of the ships slowly became less certain. {{RFAux|Resource|A480|6}} carried stores for both the Royal Navy and the 3rd Commando Brigade, and with no one to assess conflicting priorities, she remained with the fleet.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=114–115}}

[[File:Ajaxbayview.jpg|thumb|left|The former refrigeration plant in Ajax Bay, site of the field hospital, in 2008. By this time it had fallen into disrepair.|alt=A cluster of ruined industrial buildings sits on the shore of a green, treeless landscape. ]]  The provision of fuel posed a special challenge. The Rapier batteries required fuel to keep their generators running, and their isolated sites required the full-time service of a Sea King to keep them going. The Bv202s consumed fuel at a high rate because the operators kept them running constantly to keep warm and keep the radio batteries charged. The problem was not one of availability—there was ample fuel available on ships—but of distribution. The 3rd Commando Brigade's {{convert|10000|l|Impgal|adj=on}} collapsible [[pillow tank]] was holed by cannon shells from an Argentine fighter as it was being brought ashore on a mexeflote. The tanker trucks could be used to bring the fuel ashore on mexeflotes or landing craft, but it still needed to be decanted into [[Jerrycan|jerry can]]s. There was no special equipment for this, so hand pumps had to be used. Daily consumption was 698 jerry cans, of which 160 were for the Rapiers, 378 for the Bv202s, 106 for [[Land Rover 101 Forward Control|Land Rover]]s and 54 for cooking. The 3rd Commando Brigade brought 1,880 jerry cans with it, of which 1,000 were empty, 600 were full, and 280 filled and carried on vehicles. The procedure was for an empty jerry can to be handed over for a full one, but it was impractical to deny a unit fuel for not producing a jerry can. The 5th Infantry Brigade arrived with another 1,000 empty jerry cans, having been prohibited from loading full ones on its ships.{{sfn|Tustin|1984b|p=401}}{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=274–275}}{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=117–119}}

''Stromness'' brought the Emergency Fuel Handling Equipment (EFHE) on 23 May. This had been loaded on multiple ships, and not all the components could be located; but the 59 Independent Commando Squadron was still able to rig it. A [[Dracone Barge]] was moored offshore, and piping attached that allowed aviation fuel to be pumped into collapsible tanks ashore. This allowed helicopters to refuel ashore, eliminating the need to land on the LPDs, which had two helipads, or the LSLs, which had one each, for refuelling, for which they competed with the 21 light helicopters of [[3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron]].{{sfn|Tustin|1984b|p=401}}{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=274–275}}{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=117–119}}

On 24 May, 11 Field Squadron commenced work on an airstrip to allow Harriers to refuel as well. The plant and equipment earmarked for this was lost on ''Atlantic Conveyor'', but ''Stromness'' had {{convert|10|by|2|ft|adj=on}} aluminium panels for airfield surfacing, which were landed at Green Beach by helicopter and landing craft, and taken to the site with civilian vehicles. The airstrip was completed, with a ski jump for Harriers, using more than eighty of the panels, assembled by hand, on 2 June.{{sfn|Van der Bijl|Aldea|2003|pp=86–87}} The absence of 383 Commando Petroleum Troop, though, meant that there was no one to operate the fuel points until the 5th Infantry Brigade arrived.{{sfn|Tustin|1984b|p=401}}{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=274–275}}{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=117–119}} Its attached 91 Ordnance Company had a petroleum platoon, the only regular army one based in the UK. These specialists took over the EFHE at Port San Carlos as soon as they arrived on 3 June,{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=149–151, 161–164}} allowing Harriers to be refuelled there from 5 June.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=197}} It was damaged by a Harrier that crash landed on 8 June, but was repaired.{{sfn|Pook|2007|pp=144–145}}{{sfn|Van der Bijl|Aldea|2003|pp=129–130}} Over 150 operational sorties were flown from the airstrip between 5 and 14 June.{{sfn|Van der Bijl|Aldea|2003|pp=86–87}} 

[[File:Stone-run.JPG|thumb|right|[[Stone run]] near [[Mount Kent]]. These could go on for miles.|alt=A field of blue-grey and reddish boulders.]]
Argentine air attacks were initially directed at the ships, but on 27 May four [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]]s attacked the BMA, dropping twelve bombs, only four of which exploded.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=133–135}} Six men were killed and thirty wounded.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=557}} The field hospital was struck by two {{convert|400|kg|adj=on}} bombs, neither of which exploded. They would remain in place, sandbagged and defuzed, for the rest of the campaign.{{sfn|Jolly|1983|pp=69–70}} Bombs that struck the ordnance area set off stockpiles of 105 mm artillery shells, [[MILAN]] missiles and [[L16 81mm mortar|81 mm mortar]] bombs. The Commando Logistic Regiment had no fire fighting equipment, so the fire was left to burn itself out, and explosions continued through the night.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=133–135}}  All of 45 Commando's MILAN missiles were lost, along with two-hundred {{nowrap|81 mm}} mortar bombs and three-hundred {{nowrap|105 mm}} artillery rounds.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=279}}

The [[Battle of Goose Green]] on 28 and 29 May confirmed what logisticians had suspected and feared; the expenditure of ammunition was not only five times greater than that expected in a limited war, it exceeded that forecast for an all-out war against the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Another 30 days' supply had been ordered on 17 April, and was on its way south,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=280–281}} but by the evening of 28 May, the BMA held just eighty-three {{nowrap|105 mm}} artillery rounds, thirty MILAN missiles, two days' supply of ten-man ration packs and three days' of medical stores, and no one-man ration packs, cooking fuel or spare clothing. The ration situation was exacerbated when 2 Para captured nearly a thousand Argentine prisoners at [[Goose Green]], all of whom had to be fed. Since the tents were lost on ''Atlantic Conveyor'', they had to be kept in the disused refrigeration plant during the night. The Argentine wounded put more pressure on the medical supplies, and the Argentine dead had to be disposed of, although the task force had no graves unit. The Commando Logistic Regiment buried them in a mass grave near [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]].{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=143–144}}

After the war, Thompson reflected that:{{quote|The majority of senior officers and their staffs were handicapped by a dearth of understanding of the logistic realities of fighting a conventional war. Brush fire wars and [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland]] had provided few logistic problems, and most peacetime exercises, with their emphasis on tactical movement, teach false logistic lessons. Commanders on these exercises are seldom faced with the choice between moving men, and moving bullets, beans and fuel. In war, if helicopters are in short supply, and for some reason other means of movement are not available, or cannot be used, the men will walk carrying some of the beans and bullets, and helicopters will be almost exclusively employed carrying the rest.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=287}} }}

At first light on 27 May, 45 Commando embarked in LCUs that took it from Ajax Bay to Port San Carlos. It then conducted a [[loaded march]] (which the commandos called  a "[[yomp]]" and the paras called a "tab") to [[Douglas, Falkland Islands|Douglas]]. Every man carried about {{convert|120|lb}}; some carried far more. Douglas was reached at 13:00 on 28 May. 3 Para set out from Port San Carlos at 11:00 on 27 May, and reached the Arroy Pedro River, {{convert|9|km}} from [[Teal Inlet]], at 11:00 on 28 May. The paras waited until night-fall before advancing on Teal Inlet, which was secured by 23:00. They were joined on the morning of 29 May by the  Scorpion and Scimitar light tanks of No. 4 Troop, [[Blues and Royals]], whose departure from Port San Carlos had been delayed by a temporary fuel shortage which had occurred when ''Sir Lancelot'' jettisoned all its motor transport fuel on discovering an unexploded bomb on board. Once fuel was secured, they were able to make the journey to Teal Inlet, arriving on the morning of 29 May. 3 Para and 45 Commando were then ordered to advance to Estancia.{{sfn|Thompson|1985|pp=101–104}}

Helicopters resupplied 3 Para, and brought its mortars and support weapons.  Estancia House was taken on 31 May, with 3 Para utilising local farm tractors to move its stores and heavy equipment.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=586–587}} An attempt to fly 42 Commando and three {{nowrap|105 mm}} guns to [[Mount Kent]] on 29/30 May ran into a blizzard and was forced to return to Port San Carlos.

Brigadier [[Tony Wilson (British Army officer)|Tony Wilson]]'s 5th Infantry Brigade reached [[Cumberland Bay]] off South Georgia Island on ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' on 27 May. The politicians were nervous about the political repercussions if the ship were lost, so it was decided to unload it here, and move the brigade to the Falkland Islands in other ships. The ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was met by a veritable fleet of ships that proceeded to unload her passengers and cargo. The trawler cum minesweepers {{HMS|Cordella||6}}, {{HMS|Farnella||2}}, {{HMS|Junella||2}}, {{HMS|Northella||2}} and {{HMS|Pict||2}} ferried the infantry and the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance across to ''Canberra'' and ''Norland'', which departed for San Carlos at 21:00 on 28 May. Cargo was unloaded onto ''Stromness'', ''Resource'', ''Saxonia'', ''Lycaon'', {{HMS|Leeds Castle|P258|2}}, ''British Esk'' and ''British Tay''.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=149–151, 161–164}}

A false warning of an attack by Argentine forces caused ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' to weigh anchor and set sail for the UK on 29 May. So difficult was it to unload the ship that around 70 per cent of the brigade's {{nowrap|81 mm}} mortar and {{nowrap|105 mm}} artillery rounds remained on board. ''Stromness'' headed for San Carlos with most of the logistics units. Inclement weather made what would normally be a two-day voyage into a four-day one.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=149–151, 161–164}} Moore established his headquarters on ''Fearless'' on 29 May, and assumed control of land battle the following day.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=580}} ''Atlantic Causeway'', with twenty Wessex and eight Sea King helicopters, arrived at San Carlos on 1 June, and ''Canberra'' and ''Norland'' followed the next day.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=172}}

The logistics units that arrived with the 5th Infantry Brigade included 81 Ordnance Company, which supplied most services, and 91 Ordnance Company,  a third line unit that included a laundry section, bath unit and field bakery, and most importantly, the petroleum platoon.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=149–151, 161–164}} 10 Field Workshop provided maintenance support, but most of its equipment was on ''Baltic Ferry'' and ''Nordic Ferry'', which departed without unloading due to another air raid alert. The unit therefore spent much of its time guarding POWs. 407 Transport Troop brought 20 [[Snowcat]]s, predecessors of the Bv202s, but only six were landed in the first few days. There was also [[160 Provost Company]], [[Royal Military Police]] and 6 Field Cash Office, [[Royal Army Pay Corps]]. These logistic units constituted an augmentation of the Commando Logistic Regiment, rather than the logistic support required by a brigade engaged in combat operations.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=149–151, 161–164}}

As a result, the 5th Infantry Brigade's arrival in the Falklands meant that the Commando Logistic Regiment became responsible for supporting two large brigades with a total strength of around 9,000 personnel. This placed stress on the regiment, as it was structured to support only the 3rd Commando Brigade's 3,000 personnel, and it had deployed to the Falklands with less than its usual allocations of manpower and transport.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=284}}  The {{convert|230|grt|adj=on}} coastal vessel MV ''Monsunen'' had been used by the Argentinians until forced aground near Goose Green by ''Yarmouth'' on 23 May. It was salvaged by a [[prize crew]] from ''Fearless'', and used to supplement the 5th Infantry Brigade's transport.{{sfn|Van der Bijl|Aldea|2003|p=124}} 
[[File:War damaged RFA Sir Tristram 1983.jpg|thumb|right|{{RFAux|Sir Tristram|L3505|6}} showing damage inflicted in the [[Bluff Cove Air Attacks]]. The green vessel alongside her is the ''Monsunen''. |alt=A warhead with the superstructure collapsing and largely gutted by fire. A much smaller green-hulled vessel is moored alongside. ]]

While the 3rd Commando Brigade advanced on [[Port Stanley]] on a northerly axis, the 5th Infantry Brigade advanced on a southerly one. The plan was to establish a second FBMA at [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]] with a DP at [[Bluff Cove]].{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=284–285}} It was nowhere near as good as Teal Inlet. The route from Port San Carlos went all the way around [[Lafonia]], a distance that landing craft and mexeflotes could not cover on their own. While the LPDs were fast enough to get there and back in darkness, the LSLs could not.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=176–179}} Moreover, unlike at Teal Inlet, the Argentinians held the high ground overlooking it. As a result, ''Sir Galahad'' and ''Sir Tristram'' were caught unloading in daylight on 8 June and [[Bluff Cove Air Attacks|attacked by Argentine aircraft]].{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=284–285}}

Both were set ablaze. The fires on ''Sir Tristram'' soon burned themselves out, some of the cargo was saved, and the ship was ultimately salvaged, but ''Sir Galahad'' was a total loss. The disaster cost 49 men their lives; another 115 were wounded. Among the dead were four Chinese crewmen. The field hospital was flooded with casualties, and arrangements were made for landing craft to send two dozen each to ''Fearless'', ''Intrepid'' and ''Atlantic Causeway''. Others were flown to ''Uganda''.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=607}} That same day one of the LCUs from ''Fearless'' was caught in open water in daylight, and attacked and sunk by Argentine aircraft. Six men were killed. On board were six [[land rover]]s carrying the 5th Brigade's communications equipment.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=185–187}} 

For the final battles around Port Stanley, the gun positions were stocked with 500 rounds per gun,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=284–285}} with another 500 in reserve. Each combat unit would have two days' supply, with another two days' at the FBMAs at Fitzroy or Teal Inlet. The remaining LSLs made runs to Fitzroy and Teal Inlet on alternating days, moving over {{convert|1000|LT}} to each. The arrival of four more Wessex helicopters on ''Engadine'' brought the number of helicopters available to forty. These were used to move the ammunition to the gun positions. FARPs at each FBMA saved the helicopters from having to return to San Carlos.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=196–198}} The field hospital was broken up on 10 June, with teams deploying to Fitzroy and Teal Inlet.{{sfn|Jolly|1983|pp=119–120}}

The final four-day battle around Port Stanley involved some of the hardest fighting of the campaign. One battery almost ran out of ammunition, requiring an emergency helicopter resupply mission in a snowstorm at night. The lone bridge over the [[Murrell River]] collapsed when an armoured recovery vehicle loaded with ammunition attempted to cross it, cutting the 3rd Commando Brigade's overland supply line for their Bv202s, but the engineers built an air-portable bridge at Fitzroy which the Chinook delivered.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=285–286}}

On 14 June, the Argentine commander, Brigadier General [[Mario Menéndez]] surrendered Argentine forces in the Falkland Islands to Moore.{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=652–653}}

==Aftermath==
{{main|Aftermath of the Falklands War}}
Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Kennedy arrived at San Carlos soon after the Argentine surrender as Commander Royal Engineers (CRE) Works, Falkland Islands. His task was to rehabilitate Port Stanley. It took the sappers of 9 Parachute Squadron and 61 Field Squadron four days  to restore the water supply to Port Stanley. By this time, the reservoirs were down to two days' supply. In the meantime it was supplied by ''Fort Toronto'' through a dracone moored offshore. A military water supply point at [[Moody Brook]] was constructed and operated by 3 Field Squadron. The town's consumption was about {{convert|12000|impgal|l}} per day. The electric grid had also been damaged by shellfire, and took a week longer to repair. Its capacity was still limited, so it was supplemented by two 250 KW Army generators. A separate military power station was subsequently established. Fuel was supplied using a dracone.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=225–226}}{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|pp=46–47}}

[[File:16 June 1982 Port Stanley.jpg|thumb|left|Port Stanley on 16 June 1982|alt=A wharf with warehouses on the left; on the right are two-storey brick houses. Similar two-storey houses line the streets beyond.]]
The major task was restoration of the port and airfield. In the interim, the Hercules transports continued to fly from Ascension, dropping high priority items.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=227–228}} The postal unit moved from Ajax Bay into the Post Office at Port Stanley. At first, mail bags were airdropped but some fell into Argentine minefields. A method was then devised to allow the Hercules to deliver bags without having to land by trailing a grappling hook attached to the bags which snagged a wire strung between two poles.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|pp=125–126}}

Built in the 1970s, the airfield had a {{convert|4100|by|150|ft|adj=on}} runway. It was unusable because it had been cratered by the RAF. Its rehabilitation was undertaken by 11 Field Squadron and 59 Independent Commando Squadron.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|p=48}} The Argentinians had already repaired three craters. The others were filled in and topped with Argentine aluminium matting. A huge crater caused by a {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} bomb required over {{convert|1000|m2}} of matting. "Scabs", or scrapes in the runway surface, of which there were several hundred, were repaired with [[Bostik]] 276, a magnesium phosphate cement and aggregate mixture. There were 47 Hercules and several hundred Harrier landings before the airfield was closed for repairs on 15 August.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|pp=53–56}}  

The runway was too short for use by the RAF's Phantoms, so 50 Field Squadron (which had been detailed for the task in May) began extending it to {{convert|6100|ft}}. Some {{convert|9000|LT}} of airfield construction stores, plant and equipment were landed for this purpose. Aluminium matting was laid along the whole length of the runway. Some {{convert|25000|LT|t}} of quartz granite rock fill was used, which was obtained by 3 and 60 Field Squadrons from a local quarry. The first Hercules landed on the new runway on 28 August.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|pp=53–56}} [[RAF Mount Pleasant]], a permanent RAF airbase, was subsequently built, and was opened by [[Prince Andrew]] on 12 May 1985.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|p=172}}      

Sites for the breakdown and storage of bulk supplies were limited, and the warehouses were initially used for the Argentine prisoners.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=225–226}} While Port Stanley provided anchorages for deep draft vessels, berths were only {{convert|6|to|10|m|adj=on}} deep, suitable only for shallow draft vessels. The Royal Engineers built two [[slipway]]s for mexeflotes and LCUs.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=227–228}} As late as April 1983, the Ministry of Defence had 25 ships on charter to supply the Falkland Islands. About 1,000 personnel were being ferried to and from the islands each month, requiring the services of ''Uganda'' and ''[[Cunard Countess]]''. To provide a regular service, a ferry, the SS ''St Edmund'' was taken up and commissioned as a troopship, HMS ''Keren''.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|p=155}} The port was replaced by a £23 million floating wharf and warehouse complex that opened on 26 April 1984. This consisted of six {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}} North Sea oil rig support barges that were linked together. Atop them were warehouses, refrigerated storages, and accommodation and mess facilities for 200 people. It could berth vessels up to {{convert|1000|ft}} long, and was connected to the shore by a {{convert|623|ft|adj=on}} two-lane causeway. An access road was constructed by 37 Engineer Regiment.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|pp=155–156}}  

[[File:Argentine prisoners of war - Port Stanley.JPG|thumb|right|Argentine prisoners of war in Port Stanley|alt=About forty soldiers wearing olive-green jackets and pants march down a wet urban street.

With the end of hostilities in the Falklands (although [[Operation Keyhole]], the reoccupation of  [[Thule Island]] in the [[South Sandwich Islands]], remained, and was concluded on 20 June),{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=656–660}} the British forces became responsible for feeding the civilian population and 11,848 Argentine prisoners. Due to the British blockade of the island, they had only three days' rations. The prisoners were initially issued with Argentine rations, but the British withheld the officer rations as they contained alcohol. Prisoners rioted on 16 June, setting fire to their clothing store. Those taken at Goose Green had already been repatriated to Argentina via [[Montevideo]] in neutral Uruguay on ''Norland''. Some 5,000 Argentine prisoners were embarked on ''Canberra'' and 1,000 on ''Norland'' on 17 June. By 20 June 10,250 prisoners had been repatriated. Only 593 remained, including Menéndez. These were held for intelligence gathering, and to encourage Argentina to end hostilities. One British prisoner, [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Jeffrey Glover]], was held in Argentina; he was released on 16 July. The last Argentine prisoners were repatriated by 14 July.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=222–223}}{{sfn|Freedman|2005|pp=656–660}}

The Bakery Section of 91 Ordnance Company baked its first loaf in the Falkland Islands on 30 June. It baked up to 6,000 loaves per day before settling down to just 4,000 by August.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|p=44}} Although rations could soon be supplemented with fresh fruit and vegetables, it was not until August that the troops could be fed fresh rations.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=225–226}} A wing of the small [[King Edward VII Memorial Hospital]] at Port Stanley was occupied by 16 Field Ambulance. Its first task was sorting through captured Argentine medical supplies. The military hospital wing opened on 29 June. ''Uganda'' dropped anchor at [[Port William, Falkland Islands|Port William]] to supply backup care, and donated fifty hospital beds and bedding to King Edward VII Memorial Hospital.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|pp=225–226}} Having sailed from the UK on the [[TEV Rangatira (1971)|TEV ''Rangatira'']] on 19 June, 2 Field Hospital reached the Falkland Islands on 11 July. Its staff included fourteen officers and other ranks of [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]]. Its tent accommodation had been lost on ''Atlantic Conveyor'', so it moved into the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|pp=156–157}} About {{convert|3000|LT}} of British ammunition was recovered from 47 battlefield sites by 81 Ordnance Company, along with over 4.5 million rounds of Argentine ammunition. Some {{convert|1000|LT}} was found to be serviceable, and was shipped to the UK.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|p=79}} Most Argentine equipment was dumped at sea, but some items, including Chinook and [[AgustaWestland AW109|Agusta 109]] helicopters, were taken back to the UK.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|p=81}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/5849377/RAF-helicopter-built-using-half-of-chinook-captured-in-Falklands.html |access-date=24 November 2017 |title=RAF helicopter built using half of Chinook captured in Falklands |date= 17 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Discarded weapons, Stanley 1982.JPG|thumb|left|Discarded Argentine weapons in Port Stanley 1982|alt=A large pile of military hardware, including rifles, machine guns, small arms ammunition. It is roped off with red plastic tape. Three civilians look on.]]
The first units to return from the Falkland Islands were 2 and 3 Para, which left on ''Norland'' and ''Europic'' in June. The 3rd Commando Brigade followed, departing on ''Canberra'' on 26 June, with the Commando Logistic Regiment embarking on ''Sir Percivale'' two days later. This left the 5th Infantry Brigade, whose logistic support was consolidated into the Falkland Islands Logistic Battalion on 28 June. Major General [[David Thorne (British Army officer)|David Thorne]] became Commander, [[British Forces Falkland Islands]] in July. He brought the 1st Battalion [[Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons)]] and a company of the [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] with him, enabling the relief of the 5th Infantry Brigade's combat units to commence. The last of these, the 2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]], departed the Falkland Islands in July.{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=230}}

Thorne gave a high priority to providing proper accommodation for his men before the next winter. [[Portable building]]s were erected with running water, electric power and sewerage. Additional accommodation was provided by the "coastels", floating multi-storeyed accommodation vessels for 900 people with their own kitchens, fresh water, laundry and recreational facilities. ''Safe Dominia'' and ''Safe Esperia'' were chartered from the Swedish Consafe. The latter's facilities included a gymnasium, four squash courts, two swimming pools and a canteen, which was operated by [[NAAFI]]. They were joined by the British-built ''Pursuivant'', which left for the Falkland Islands in July 1983.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|pp=155–156}} Thorne was succeeded by Major General [[Peter de la Billière]] in 1984.{{sfn|Fursdon|1988|pp=146–147}}
      
A Grave Registration unit of the [[Royal Pioneer Corps]] arrived on the SS ''Strathewe'', along with coffins and embalming materials. It had the task of disinterring the bodies of those killed. For the first time in British history, families were given the option of having their loved ones' remains returned to the UK, and 64 chose to exercise this option. The remaining 14 bodies (including that of Lieutenant Colonel [[H. Jones]], who was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) for his part in the Battle of Goose Green) were re-interred in the [[Blue Beach Military Cemetery at San Carlos]].{{sfn|Privratsky|2014|p=229}} An [[Argentine Military Cemetery]] was established near Goose Green in 1983,{{sfn|Freedman|2005|p=660}} which was rebuilt between 2002 and 2004. The Argentine government did not wish to "repatriate" its dead, as it considered that they were already in Argentina. Many were not identified, and were buried with the inscription "Argentine soldier known unto God."{{sfn|Rubenstein|2011|p=153}}

==Lessons==
In the logistics section of its report to Parliament on the lessons of the war, the Ministry of Defence highlighted the prodigious expenditure of ammunition and missiles; the high level of logistic support required for operations outside western Europe; the importance of civil resources in the defence effort; and the utility of aerial refuelling.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=295–296}}{{sfn|Secretary of State for Defence|1982|pp=25–27}} The value of the Royal Navy's amphibious forces was reassessed. A replacement for the lost ''Sir Galahad'' was ordered, and two roll-on roll-off ferries, {{RFAux|Sir Caradoc|L3522|6}} and {{RFAux|Sir Lamorak|L3532|2}}, were chartered while the new {{RFAux|Sir Galahad|1987|6}} was built and ''Sir Tristram'' was repaired. However, the government still dithered over the replacement of the ''Fearless''-class LPDs;{{sfn|Grove|1987|pp=383–387}} and replacements, the {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|4}}, were not ordered until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=10 December 2017 |publisher=Naval Technology|title=LPD (R) Albion Class Landing Platform Dock, United Kingdom|url=http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/lpd/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil rig support ship MV ''Stena Inspector'' was purchased in 1983, and became {{RFAux|Diligence|A132|6}}, while ''Astronomer'' and ''Contender Bezant'' were retained as RFA ''Reliant'' and ''Argus'' respectively. The value of STUFT was recognised, and over the next few years STUFT would see active service in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.{{sfn|Grove|1987|pp=383–387}}

The Falkland War was also studied in other countries, notably in China, where it was the subject of organised teaching and research at the PLA Naval Command College in [[Nanjing]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2008|pp=65–67}} The Americans were impressed by the speed with which the British were able to mobilise their forces and get them moving to the theatre of operations in response to a crisis that had erupted with very little warning.{{sfn|Valovcin|1992|pp=19–22}} A programme was already under way to improve American sealift capability, and between 1982 and 1986, the [[United States Congress]] appropriated and spent US $7 billion on the purchase or lease of new logistics ships. They would be tested in the 1991 [[Gulf War]].{{sfn|Menarchik|1993|pp=10–11}} Thompson felt that the overriding importance of logistics as the driving factor of operations was overlooked. He was particularly disappointed that the 5th Infantry Brigade had not used the time it had before embarkation to remedy more of its logistical shortcomings.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=297–298}}

Logistics lessons drawn from the conflict were not new, but had not been learned either. These included the failure to integrate operational and tactical planning; improper tactical loading of ships; outdated planning data for consumables, particularly fuel and ammunition; lack of heavy-lift helicopters and poor discipline in the employment of helicopters; shortages of land transport; the employment of new and highly complex equipment on the battlefield; faulty casualty evacuation plans; and the need for post-conflict planning.{{sfn|Valovcin|1992|pp=19–22}} British and American commentators observed that much of this could be traced to logistically unrealistic peacetime training and exercises, and called for more exercises where there were "no permanent quarters to house the troops, no Federal Express to deliver critical supply parts, no power production and no in-place hookups for communications or intelligence information."{{sfn|Valovcin|1992|p=21}}

'''Colin Barker''' (born 1939) is a British [[sociologist]] as well as a [[Marxist]] historian and writer. A former long-standing member of the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] in [[Manchester]], he is the author of numerous articles and works on Marxism, including a history of the Polish trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], ''Festival of the Oppressed''.

A [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], Barker was a member of the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialism Group]] in Oxford and Manchester from 1962. He was a Senior Lecturer in Sociology at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] from 1967 to 2002 and is an organiser of the periodic International Conference on Alternative Futures and Popular Protest there.

He regularly spoke at the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party's]] annual Marxism event. In 2013, he joined opposition to the SWP Central Committee's handling of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)#Internal crisis since 2013 over allegations of rape|allegations of rape made against 'Comrade Delta']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpgb.org.uk/home/weekly-worker/951/swp-crisis-silence-of-the-lambs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206155210/http://cpgb.org.uk/home/weekly-worker/951/swp-crisis-silence-of-the-lambs |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and left the organisation in 2014 and joined the newly-formed [[Revolutionary Socialism in the 21st Century (rs21)]].

{{History of the United States}}
{{Periods in US history}}
The '''colonial history of the United States''' covers the history of [[European colonization of the Americas]] from the start of colonization in the early 16th century until their incorporation into the United States of America. In the late 16th century, England, France, Spain, and the Netherlands launched major colonization programs in eastern North America.&lt;ref name="Cooke 1998" /&gt; Small early attempts sometimes disappeared, such as the English [[Roanoke Colony#The Lost Colony|Lost Colony of Roanoke]]. Everywhere, the death rate was very high among the first arrivals. Nevertheless, successful colonies were established within several decades.

European settlers came from a variety of social and religious groups, including adventurers, soldiers, farmers, indentured servants, tradesmen, and a few from the aristocracy.  Settlers traveling to the continent included the Dutch of [[New Netherland]], the Swedes and Finns of [[New Sweden]], the English Quakers of the [[Province of Pennsylvania]], the English Puritans of [[New England]], the English settlers of [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the English Catholics and Protestant nonconformists of the [[Province of Maryland]], the "worthy poor" of the [[Province of Georgia]], the Germans who settled the mid-Atlantic colonies, and the [[Ulster Scots people]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. These groups all became part of the United States when it gained its independence in 1776. [[Russian America]] and parts of [[New France]] and [[New Spain]] were also incorporated into the United States at various points. The diverse groups from these various regions built colonies of distinctive social, religious, political, and economic style.

Over time, non-British colonies East of the [[Mississippi River]] were taken over and most of the inhabitants were assimilated. In Nova Scotia, however, the British expelled the French [[Acadians]], and many relocated to Louisiana. No major civil wars occurred in the [[thirteen colonies]]. The two chief armed rebellions were short-lived failures in [[Bacon's Rebellion|Virginia in 1676]] and in [[Leisler's Rebellion|New York in 1689–91]]. Some of the colonies developed legalized systems of slavery,&lt;ref&gt;William M. Wiecek, "The Statutory Law of Slavery and Race in the Thirteen Mainland Colonies of British America," ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 34#2 (1977)  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1925316 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; centered largely around the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Wars were recurrent between the French and the British during the [[French and Indian Wars]]. By 1760, France was defeated and its colonies were seized by Britain.

On the eastern seaboard, the four distinct English regions were New England, the Middle Colonies, the [[Chesapeake Bay Colonies]] (Upper South), and the [[Southern Colonies]] (Lower South). Some historians add a fifth region of the Frontier, which was never separately organized.&lt;ref name="Cooke 1998"&gt;Cooke, ed. ''North America in Colonial Times'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that European settlers arrived around 1600–1650, a significant percentage of the Indians living in the eastern region had been ravaged by disease, possibly introduced to them decades before by explorers and sailors (although no conclusive cause has ever been established).&lt;ref name="middleton"&gt;Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011) p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

== The goals of colonization ==
Colonists came from European kingdoms that had highly developed military, naval, governmental, and entrepreneurial capabilities. The Spanish and Portuguese centuries-old experience of conquest and colonization during the [[Reconquista]], coupled with new oceanic ship navigation skills, provided the tools, ability, and desire to colonize the New World.  These efforts were managed respectively by the [[Casa de Contratación]] and the [[Casa da Índia]].

England, France, and the Netherlands had also started colonies in the West Indies and North America. They had the ability to build ocean-worthy ships but did not have as strong a history of colonization in foreign lands as did Portugal and Spain. However, English entrepreneurs gave their colonies a foundation of merchant-based investment that seemed to need much less government support.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wallace Notestein]], ''English People on Eve of Colonization, 1603–30'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, matters concerning the colonies were dealt with primarily by the [[Privy Council of England]] and its committees. The [[Board of Trade|Commission of Trade]] was set up in 1625 as the first special body convened to advise on colonial (plantation) questions.  From 1696 until the end of the [[American Revolution]], colonial affairs were the responsibility of the Board of Trade in partnership with the relevant secretaries of state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4196|title=Board of Trade and Secretaries of State: America and West Indies, Original Correspondence|work=The National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles McLean Andrews]], [https://archive.org/stream/colonialselfgov00andrgoog/colonialselfgov00andrgoog_djvu.txt Colonial Self-Government, 1652–1689], (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Andrews, [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=33313 British Committees, Commissions, and Councils of Trade and Plantations, 1622–1675], (1908)&lt;/ref&gt; which changed from the [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]] to the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in 1768.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/american-west-indian-colonies.htm American and West Indian colonies before 1782], The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mercantilism ===
[[Mercantilism]] was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies from the 1660s, which meant that the government became a partner with merchants based in England in order to increase political power and private wealth. This was done to the exclusion of other empires and even other merchants in its own colonies. The government protected its London-based merchants and kept out others by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from the realm and minimize imports.

The government also fought smuggling, and this became a direct source of controversy with American merchants when their normal business activities became reclassified as "smuggling" by the [[Navigation Acts]]. This included activities that had been ordinary business dealings previously, such as direct trade with the French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy which protected the British colonies and also threatened the colonies of the other empires, sometimes even seizing them. Thus, the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607–1755''  (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom from religious persecution ===
The prospect of religious persecution by authorities of the crown and the [[Church of England]] prompted a significant number of colonization efforts. The [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] were separatist Puritans who fled persecution in England, first to the Netherlands and ultimately to [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth Plantation]] in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following 20 years, people fleeing persecution from [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] settled most of [[New England]]. Similarly, the [[Province of Maryland]] was founded in part to be a haven for [[Roman Catholics]].

== Early colonial failures ==
{{euromericas}}
Anonymous Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to map the eastern seaboard of America from New York to Florida, as documented in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502. However, they kept their discoveries a secret and did not attempt to settle in North America, as the [[Inter caetera]] issued by [[Pope Alexander VI]] had granted these lands to Spain in 1493. Other countries did attempt to found colonies in America over the following century, but most of those attempts ended in failure. The colonists themselves faced high rates of death from disease, starvation, inefficient resupply, conflict with American Indians, attacks by rival European powers, and other causes.

Spain had numerous failed attempts, including [[San Miguel de Gualdape]] in Georgia (1526), [[Pánfilo de Narváez]]'s expedition to Florida's Gulf coast (1528–36), Pensacola in West Florida (1559–61), [[Joara|Fort San Juan]] in North Carolina (1567–68), and the [[Ajacán Mission]] in Virginia (1570–71).&lt;ref name="Cooke 1998" /&gt; The French failed at Parris Island, South Carolina (1562–63), [[Fort Caroline]] on Florida's Atlantic coast (1564–65), Saint Croix Island, Maine (1604-05),&lt;ref name="Cooke 1998" /&gt; and [[French colonization of Texas|Fort Saint Louis, Texas]] (1685–89). The most notable English failures were the "[[Roanoke Colony|Lost Colony of Roanoke]]" (1587–90) in North Carolina and [[Popham Colony]] in Maine (1607–08). It was at the Roanoke Colony that [[Virginia Dare]] became the first English child born in the Americas; her fate is unknown.

== New Spain ==
{{Main|Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:RUIDIAZ(1893) 1.083 JUAN PONCE DE LEÓN.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The Spaniard [[Juan Ponce de León]] named and explored [[Florida]].]]

Starting in the 15th century, Spain built a colonial empire in the Americas consisting of [[New Spain]] and other vice-royalties. New Spain included territories in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, much of the United States west of the [[Mississippi River]], parts of Latin America (including Puerto Rico), and the [[Spanish East Indies]] (including [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]). New Spain encompassed the [[Louisiana (New Spain)|territory of Louisiana]] after the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)]], though Louisiana reverted to France in the 1800 [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]].

Many territories that had been part of New Spain became part of the United States after 1776 through various wars and treaties, including the [[Louisiana Purchase]] (1803), the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] (1819), the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), and the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898). There were also several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]], but Spain gave the United States all claims to the Pacific Northwest in the Adams–Onís Treaty.

=== Florida ===
{{Main|History of Florida|Spanish Florida}}
Spain established several small outposts in Florida in the early 16th century. The most important of these was [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], founded in 1565 but repeatedly attacked and burned by pirates, privateers, and English forces. Its buildings survived even though nearly all the Spanish left. It claims to be the oldest European settlement in the continental United States.

The British attacked Spanish Florida during numerous wars. As early as 1687, the Spanish government had begun to offer asylum to slaves from British colonies, and the Spanish Crown officially proclaimed in 1693 that runaway slaves would find freedom in Florida in return for converting to Catholicism and four years of military service to the Crown. In effect, Spain created a maroon settlement in Florida as a front-line defense against English attacks from the north. Spain also intended to destabilize the plantation economy of the British colonies by creating a free black community to attract slaves seeking escape and refuge from the British slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linebaugh|first1=Peter|last2=Rediker|first2=Marcus|title=The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic|date=2001|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|location=United States|isbn=978-0-8070-5007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1763, Spain traded Florida to Great Britain in exchange for control of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the [[Seven Years' War]]. Florida was home to about 3,000 Spaniards at the time, and nearly all quickly left. Britain occupied Florida but did not send many settlers to the area, and control was restored to Spain in 1783 by the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Spain sent no more settlers or missionaries to Florida during this second colonial period. The inhabitants of [[West Florida]] revolted against the Spanish in 1810 and formed the [[Republic of West Florida]], which was quickly annexed by the United States. The United States took possession of [[East Florida]] in 1821 according to the terms of the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tebeau |first=Charlton W. |authorlink=Charlton W.

=== New Mexico ===
{{Main|History of New Mexico}}
Throughout the 16th century, Spain explored the southwest from Mexico, with the most notable explorer being [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado|Francisco Coronado]], whose expedition rode throughout modern New Mexico and Arizona, arriving in New Mexico in 1540. The Spanish moved north from Mexico, settling villages in the upper valley of the Rio Grande, including much of the western half of the present-day state of New Mexico. The capital of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was settled in 1610 and remains the oldest continually inhabited settlement in the United States. Local Indians expelled the Spanish for 12 years following the [[Pueblo Revolt]] of 1680; they returned in 1692 in the bloodless reoccupation of Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;David Grant Noble, ''Santa Fe: History of an Ancient City'' (2nd ed. 2008) ch 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; Control was by Spain (223 years) and Mexico (25 years) until 1846, when the [[Army of the West (1846)|American Army of the West]] took over in the [[Mexican–American War]].

Spanish explorers sailed along the coast of present-day [[History of California through 1899|California]] from the early 16th century to the mid-18th century, but no settlements were established over those centuries.

From 1769 until the independence of Mexico in 1820, Spain sent missionaries and soldiers to [[Alta California]] who created a series of missions operated by [[Franciscan]] priests. They also operated ''presidios'' (forts), ''pueblos'' (settlements)s, and [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] (land grant ranches), along the southern and central coast of California. Father [[Junípero Serra]], founded the first missions in Spanish upper ''[[The Californias|Las Californias]]'', starting with [[Mission San Diego de Alcalá]] in 1769. Through the Spanish and Mexican eras they eventually comprised a series of 21 missions to spread Roman Catholicism among the local Native Americans, linked by ''[[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]'' ("The Royal Road"). They were established to convert the [[indigenous peoples of California]], while protecting historic Spanish claims to the area. The missions introduced European technology, livestock, and crops. The [[Indian Reductions]] converted the native peoples into groups of [[Mission Indians]]; they worked as laborers in the missions and the ranchos. In the 1830s the missions were disbanded and the lands sold to Californios. The [[Population of Native California|indigenous Native American population]] was around 150,000; the ''[[Californio]]s'' (Mexican era Californians) around 10,000; with the rest immigrant Americans and other nationalities involved in trade and business in California.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E.

In September 1493, [[Christopher Columbus]] set sail on his [[Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|second voyage]] with 17 ships from [[Cádiz]].&lt;ref name=Brau1&gt;{{cite book|last=Brau|first=Salvador|title=Puerto Rico y su historia: investigaciones críticas|year=1894|publisher=Francisco Vives Moras|location=Valencia, Spain|pages=96–97|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7mhDAAAAIAAJ|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 19, 1493 he landed on the island of Puerto Rico, naming it ''San Juan Bautista'' in honor of Saint [[John the Baptist]]. The first European colony, [[Caparra Archaeological Site|Caparra]], was founded on August 8, 1508 by [[Juan Ponce de León]], a [[lieutenant]] under Columbus, who was greeted by the Taíno Cacique [[Agüeybaná (The Great Sun)|Agüeybaná]] and who later became the first [[governor]] of the island.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vicente Yañez Pinzón]] is considered the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, but he never arrived on the island.&lt;/ref&gt; Ponce de Leon was actively involved in the Higuey massacre of 1503 in Puerto Rico. In 1508, Sir Ponce de Leon was chosen by the Spanish Crown to lead the conquest and slavery of the Taíno Indians for gold mining operations.&lt;ref name="The Tainos"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tainos- Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus |page=155|series=Yale University Press|first=Irving |last=Rouse |isbn=0-300-05181-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the colony was abandoned in favor of a nearby islet on the coast, named Puerto Rico (Rich Port), which had a suitable harbor. In 1511, a second settlement, [[San Germán, Puerto Rico|San Germán]] was established in the southwestern part of the island. During the 1520s, the island took the name of Puerto Rico while the port became [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].

As part of the colonization process, [[African slave trade|African slaves]] were brought to the island in 1513. Following the decline of the Taíno population, more slaves were brought to Puerto Rico; however, the number of slaves on the island paled in comparison to those in neighboring islands.&lt;ref name=Dietz&gt;Dietz, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, early in the colonization of Puerto Rico, attempts were made to wrest control of Puerto Rico from Spain. The Caribs, a raiding tribe of the Caribbean, attacked Spanish settlements along the banks of the Daguao and Macao rivers in 1514 and again in 1521 but each time they were easily repelled by the superior Spanish firepower. However, these would not be the last attempts at control of Puerto Rico. The European powers quickly realized the potential of the newly discovered lands and attempted to gain control of them. Nonetheless, Puerto Rico remained a Spanish possession until the 19th century.

The last half of the 19th century was marked by the Puerto Rican struggle for [[sovereignty]]. A census conducted in 1860 revealed a population of 583,308. Of these, 300,406 (51.5%) were white and 282,775 (48.5%) were persons of color, the latter including people of primarily African heritage, [[mulatto]]s and [[mestizo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Grose, Howard B., ''Advance in the Antilles; the new era in Cuba and Porto Rico'', {{OCLC|1445643}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the population in Puerto Rico was illiterate (83.7%) and lived in poverty, and the agricultural industry—at the time, the main source of income—was hampered by lack of road infrastructure, adequate tools and equipment, and natural disasters, including hurricanes and droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy also suffered from increasing tariffs and taxes imposed by the Spanish Crown. Furthermore, Spain had begun to exile or jail any person who called for liberal reforms. The Spanish–American War broke out in 1898, in the aftermath of the explosion of [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']] in [[Havana harbor]]. The U.S. defeated Spain by the end of the year, and won control of Puerto Rico in the ensuing peace treaty. In the [[Foraker Act]] of 1900, the U.S. Congress established Puerto Rico's status as an [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territory]].

[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|The 1750 possessions of Britain (pink and purple), France (blue), and Spain (orange) in contrast to the borders of contemporary Canada and the United States.]]

New France was the vast area centered on the Saint Lawrence river, Great Lakes, [[Mississippi River]] and other major tributary rivers that was explored and [[French colonization of the Americas|claimed]] by France starting in the early 17th century. It was composed of several colonies: [[Acadia]], [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], [[Île-Royale (New France)|Île-Royale]] (present-day [[Cape Breton Island]]), and Île Saint Jean (present-day [[Prince Edward Island]]). These colonies came under British or Spanish control after the [[French and Indian War]], though France briefly re-acquired a portion of Louisiana in 1800. The United States would gain much of New France in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the U.S. would acquire another portion of French territory with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. The remainder of New France became part of [[Canada]], with the exception of the French island of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]].

=== Pays d'en Haut ===
By 1660, French fur trappers, missionaries and military detachments based in Montreal pushed west along the Great Lakes upriver into the [[Pays d'en Haut]] and founded outposts at [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Fort de Buade]] and [[St. Ignace, Michigan|Saint Ignace]] (both at [[Michilimackinac]]), [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Sainte Marie]], [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]], and [[Detroit]] in 1701. During the French and Indian War (1754–1763) many of these settlements became occupied by the British. By 1773, the population of Detroit was 1,400.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Peterson, Jennifer S. H. Brown, ''Many roads to Red River'' (2001), p69&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the War for Independence in 1783, the region south of the Great Lakes formally became part of the United States.

=== Illinois Country ===
The [[Illinois country]] by 1752 had a French population of 2,500; it was located to the west of the ''[[Ohio Country]]'' and was concentrated around [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], and [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Sainte Genevieve]]. According to one scholar, "The Illinois [[Habitant]] was a gay soul; he seemed shockingly carefree to later, self-righteous Puritans from the American colonies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Natalia Maree Belting|author2=Carl J.

=== Louisiana ===
French claims to [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] stretched thousands of miles from modern Louisiana north to the largely unexplored [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and west to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It was generally divided into Upper and [[Lower Louisiana]]. This vast tract was first settled at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] around 1700, and continued to grow when 7,000 French immigrants founded [[New Orleans]] in 1718. Settlement proceeded very slowly; New Orleans became an important port as the gateway to the Mississippi River, but there was little other economic development because the city lacked a prosperous hinterland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Garretson Clark|title=New Orleans, 1718–1812: An Economic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auzR3dtjUFMC&amp;pg=PA88|year=1970|publisher=Pelican Publishing|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1763, Louisiana was ceded to Spain around New Orleans and west of the Mississippi River. In the 1780s, the western border of the newly independent United States stretched to the Mississippi River. The United States reached an agreement with Spain for navigation rights on the river and was content to let the "feeble" colonial power stay in control of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/louisiana-purchase|title=Louisiana Purchase – Thomas Jefferson's Monticello|website=www.monticello.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation changed when [[Napoleon]] forced Spain to return Louisiana to France in 1802 and threatened to close the river to American vessels. Alarmed, the United States offered to buy New Orleans.

Napoleon needed funds to wage another war with Great Britain, and he doubted that France could defend such a huge and distant territory. He therefore offered to sell all of Louisiana for $15 million. The United States completed the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, doubling the size of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Junius P. Rodriguez, ''The Louisiana Purchase: A Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castelloplan.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of [[New Amsterdam]] in 1660]]
''Nieuw-Nederland'', or '''New Netherland''', was a colonial province of the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] chartered in 1614, in what became [[New York State]], [[New Jersey]], and parts of other neighboring states.&lt;ref&gt;Jaap Jacobs, ''The Colony of New Netherland: A Dutch Settlement in Seventeenth-Century America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The peak population was less than 10,000. The Dutch established a [[patroon]] system with feudal-like rights given to a few powerful landholders; they also established religious tolerance and free trade. The colony's capital of [[New Amsterdam]] was founded in 1625 and located at the southern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]], which grew to become a major world city.

The city was captured by the English in 1664; they took complete control of the colony in 1674 and renamed it [[Province of New York|New York]]. However the Dutch landholdings remained, and the Hudson River Valley maintained a traditional Dutch character until the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Kammen, ''Colonial New York: A History'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ ch. 1 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kartskiss över Nya Sverige.png|thumb|Map of New Sweden by [[Amandus Johnson]]]]
'''New Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Nya Sverige}}) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] colony that existed along the [[Delaware River Valley]] from 1638 to 1655 and encompassed land in present-day [[Delaware]], southern [[New Jersey]], and southeastern [[Pennsylvania]]. The several hundred settlers were centered around the capital of [[Fort Christina]], at the location of what is today the city of [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. The colony also had settlements near the present-day location of [[Salem, New Jersey]] ([[Fort Nya Elfsborg]]) and on [[Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Tinicum Island, Pennsylvania]]. The colony was captured by the Dutch in 1655 and merged into [[New Netherland]], with most of the colonists remaining. Years later, the entire New Netherland colony was incorporated into England's colonial holdings.

The colony of New Sweden introduced [[Lutheranism]] to America in the form of some of the continent's oldest European churches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amandus Johnson]]  ''The Swedes on the Delaware'' (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists also introduced the [[log cabin]] to America, and numerous rivers, towns, and families in the lower Delaware River Valley region derive their names from the Swedes. The [[C. A. Nothnagle Log House|Nothnagle Log House]] in present-day [[Gibbstown, New Jersey]], was constructed in the late 1630s during the time of the New Sweden colony.

England made its first successful efforts at the start of the 17th century for several reasons. During this era, English proto-nationalism and national assertiveness blossomed under the threat of Spanish invasion, assisted by a degree of Protestant militarism and the energy of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. At this time, however, there was no official attempt by the English government to create a colonial empire. Rather the motivation behind the founding of colonies was piecemeal and variable. Practical considerations played their parts, such as [[Indian commerce with early English colonists and the early United States|commercial enterprise]], over-crowding, and the desire for freedom of religion. The main waves of settlement came in the 17th century. After 1700, most immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[indentured servant]]s, young unmarried men and women seeking a new life in a much richer environment.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Moller, "Sex Composition and Correlated Culture Patterns of Colonial America," ''William and Mary Quarterly'' Vol. 2, No. 2 (Apr., 1945), pp. 113–153 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1923515 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus view among economic historians and economists is that the indentured servitude occurred largely as "an institutional response to a capital market imperfection," but that it "enabled prospective migrants to borrow against their future earnings in order to pay the high cost of passage to America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=140, 144|jstor=2123771|title=Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

[[Alexander Hamilton (Maryland doctor)|Dr. Alexander Hamilton]] (1712–1756) was a Scottish-born doctor and writer who lived and worked in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. [[Leo Lemay]] says that his 1744 travel diary ''Gentleman's Progress: The Itinerarium of Dr. Alexander Hamilton'' is "the best single portrait of men and manners, of rural and urban life, of the wide range of society and scenery in colonial America."&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Leo Lemay, ''Men of Letters in Colonial Maryland'' (1972) p 229.&lt;/ref&gt;  His diary has been widely used by scholars, and covers his travels from Maryland to Maine. Biographer Elaine Breslaw says that he encountered:

=== Chesapeake Bay area ===
{{Main|Jamestown, Virginia|Colony of Virginia|Province of Maryland}}

==== Virginia ====
The first successful English colony was [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], established May 14, 1607 near [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The business venture was financed and coordinated by the [[London Virginia Company]], a joint stock company looking for gold. Its first years were extremely difficult, with very high death rates from disease and starvation, wars with local Indians, and little gold. The colony survived and flourished by turning to [[tobacco]] as a [[cash crop]]. By the late 17th century, Virginia's export economy was largely based on tobacco, and new, richer settlers came in to take up large portions of land, build large plantations and import indentured servants and slaves. In 1676, [[Bacon's Rebellion]] occurred, but was suppressed by royal officials. After Bacon's Rebellion, African [[slave trade|slaves]] rapidly replaced indentured servants as Virginia's main labor force.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;Alan Taylor, ''American Colonies,'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heinemann"&gt;Ronald L. Heinemann, ''Old Dominion, New Commonwealth: A History of Virginia, 1607–2007'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial assembly shared power with a royally appointed governor. On a more local level, governmental power was invested in county courts, which were self-perpetuating (the incumbents filled any vacancies and there never were popular elections). As cash crop producers, Chesapeake plantations were heavily dependent on trade with England. With easy navigation by river, there were few towns and no cities; planters shipped directly to Britain. High death rates and a very young population profile characterized the colony during its first years.&lt;ref name="heinemann" /&gt;

==== Puritans ====
{{Main|Puritans|Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)}}
The [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to physically distance themselves from the Church of England. They initially moved to the Netherlands, then decided to re-establish themselves in America. The initial Pilgrim settlers sailed to North America in 1620 on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Upon their arrival, they drew up the [[Mayflower Compact]], by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590–1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-separatist Puritans constituted a much larger group than the Pilgrims, and they established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1629 with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620–1640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Bremer, ''The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puritans created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit, and politically innovative culture that still influences the modern United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Lee Tuveson, ''Redeemer nation: the idea of America's millennial role'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; They hoped that this new land would serve as a "[[redeemer nation]]". They fled England and attempted to create a "nation of saints" or a "[[City upon a Hill]]" in America: an intensely religious, thoroughly righteous community designed to be an example for all of Europe.

Economically, Puritan New England fulfilled the expectations of its founders. The Puritan economy was based on the efforts of [[subsistence agriculture|self-supporting farmsteads]] that traded only for goods which they could not produce themselves, unlike the cash crop-oriented plantations of the Chesapeake region.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Mackin, ''Americans and their land: the house built on abundance'' (University of Michigan Press, 2006) p 29&lt;/ref&gt; There was a generally higher economic standing and standard of living in New England than in the Chesapeake. New England became an important mercantile and shipbuilding center, along with agriculture, fishing, and logging, serving as the hub for trading between the southern colonies and Europe.&lt;ref name="ciment"&gt;James Ciment, ed. ''Colonial America: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural, and Economic History'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other New England ====
[[Providence Plantation]] was founded in 1636 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] on land provided by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] sachem [[Canonicus]]. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements, and he and other settlers founded Providence Plantation based on an egalitarian constitution providing for majority rule "in civil things" and "liberty of conscience" in religious matters.&lt;ref name="taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, a second group including [[Anne Hutchinson]] established a second settlement on [[Aquidneck Island]], also known as Rhode Island.

Other colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]]. These small settlements were absorbed by Massachusetts when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.

==== Dominion of New England ====
Under King [[James II of England]], the New England colonies, New York, and the Jerseys were briefly united as the [[Dominion of New England]] (1686–89). The administration was eventually led by Governor Sir [[Edmund Andros]] and seized colonial charters, revoked land titles, and ruled without local assemblies, causing anger among the population. The [[1689 Boston revolt]] was inspired by England's [[Glorious Revolution]] against James II and led to the arrest of Andros, Boston Anglicans, and senior dominion officials by the Massachusetts militia. Andros was jailed for several months, then returned to England. The Dominion of New England was dissolved and governments resumed under their earlier charters.&lt;ref&gt;James Truslow Adams, ''The founding of New England'' (1921) pp 398–431 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k4eo4r9BFdAC online]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Massachusetts charter had been revoked in 1684, and a new one was issued in 1691 that combined Massachusetts and Plymouth into the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]. [[William III of England|King William III]] sought to unite the New England colonies militarily by appointing [[Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont|the Earl of Bellomont]] to three simultaneous governorships and military command over Connecticut and Rhode Island. However, these attempts failed at unified control.

=== Middle Colonies ===
{{Main|Middle Colonies}}

The Middle Colonies consisted of the present-day states of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Delaware]] and were characterized by a large degree of diversity—religious, political, economic, and ethnic.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Bodle,  "Themes and directions in Middle Colonies historiography, 1980-1994." ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 51.3 (1994): 355-388. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2947435 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] was taken over by the British and renamed New York. However, large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany. Meanwhile, Yankees from New England started moving in, as did immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Kammen, ''Colonial New York: A History'' (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey began as a division of New York, and was divided into the proprietary colonies of [[East Jersey|East]] and [[West Jersey]] for a time.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Pomfret, ''Colonial New Jersey: A History'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of Quaker [[William Penn]]. The main population elements included Quaker population based in Philadelphia, a Scotch Irish population on the Western frontier, and numerous German colonies in between.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Illick, ''Colonial Pennsylvania: a history'' (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  Philadelphia became the largest city in the colonies with its central location, excellent port, and a population of about 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Russell F. Weigley, ed., '' Philadelphia: a 300 year history'' (1982). [https://www.amazon.com/Philadelphia-300-Year-History-Barra-Foundation/dp/0393016102/  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-18th century, Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited deference to the small upper-class. A writer in the ''Pennsylvania Journal'' summed it up in 1756:
:The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade; they enjoy in [are fond of] Freedom, and the ''meanest among them'' thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Rossiter, ''Seedtime of the Republic: the origin of the American tradition of political liberty'' (1953) p 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South ===
The predominant culture of the South was rooted in the settlement of the region by [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonists]]. In the seventeenth century, most voluntary colonists were of [[English people|English]] origins who settled chiefly along the coastal regions of the Eastern seaboard.  The majority of early British settlers were [[indentured servant]]s, who gained freedom after enough work to pay off their passage.  The wealthier men who paid their way received land grants known as headrights, to encourage settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html&amp;date=2009-10-24+10:13:36 "Indentured Servitude in Colonial America"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French and Spanish established colonies in [[Spanish Florida|Florida]], [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], and [[Spanish Texas|Texas]]. The Spanish colonized Florida in the 16th century, with their communities reaching a peak in the late 17th century. In the British and French colonies, most colonists arrived after 1700. They cleared land, built houses and outbuildings, and worked on the large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] that dominated export agriculture. Many were involved in the labor-intensive cultivation of tobacco, the first cash crop of Virginia.  With a decrease in the number of British willing to go to the colonies in the eighteenth century, planters began importing more enslaved Africans, who became the predominant labor force on the plantations. Tobacco exhausted the soil quickly, requiring new fields to be cleared on a regular basis. Old fields were used as pasture and for crops such as corn and wheat, or allowed to grow into woodlots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Isaac |first= Rhys |title= The Transformation of Virginia 1740–1790 |year= 1982 |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |isbn= 0-8078-4814-X |pages= 22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rice]] cultivation in South Carolina became another major commodity crop.  Some historians have argued that slaves from the lowlands of western Africa, where rice was a basic crop, provided key skills, knowledge and technology for irrigation and construction of earthworks to support rice cultivation.  The early methods and tools used in South Carolina were congruent with those in Africa.  British colonists would have had little or no familiarity with the complex process of growing rice in fields flooded by irrigation works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Meinig |first= D.W. |authorlink= D.W.

In the mid- to late-18th century, large groups of [[Scottish people|Scots]] and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] (later called the Scots-Irish) immigrated and settled in the back country of [[Appalachia]] and the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]. They were the largest group of colonists from the British Isles before the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.361-368&lt;/ref&gt;  In a census taken in 2000 of Americans and their self-reported ancestries, areas where people reported '[[Maps of American ancestries|American]]' ancestry were the places where, historically, many Scottish, Scotch-Irish and English Borderer Protestants settled in America: the interior as well as some of the coastal areas of the South, and especially the Appalachian region. The population with some Scots and Scots-Irish ancestry may number 47 million, as most people have multiple heritages, some of which they may not know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The early colonists, especially the Scots-Irish in the back-country, engaged in [[endemic warfare|warfare]], [[trade]], and cultural exchanges.  Those living in the backcountry were more likely to join with [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek Indians]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Choctaw]]s and other regional native groups.

The oldest university in the South, [[The College of William &amp; Mary]], was founded in 1693 in Virginia; it pioneered in the teaching of [[political economy]] and educated future U.S. Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[James Monroe|Monroe]] and [[John Tyler|Tyler]], all from Virginia.  Indeed, the entire region dominated politics in the [[First Party System]] era: for example, four of the first five [[President of the United States|Presidents]]— [[George Washington|Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[James Madison|Madison]], and [[James Monroe|Monroe]] — were from Virginia.  The two oldest public universities are also in the South: the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] (1795) and the [[University of Georgia]] (1785).

The colonial South included the plantation colonies of the Chesapeake region (Virginia, Maryland, and, by some classifications, Delaware) and the lower South (Carolina, which eventually split into North and South Carolina; and Georgia).&lt;ref name="ciment" /&gt;

==== Chesapeake society ====
The top five percent or so of the white population of Virginia and Maryland in the mid-18th century were planters who possessed growing wealth and increasing political power and social prestige. They controlled the local Anglican church, choosing ministers and handling church property and disbursing local charity. They sought election to the house of purchases or appointment as justice of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert H. Tillson|title=Gentry and Common Folk: Political Culture on a Virginia Frontier, 1740–1789|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orzODbUcpiYC&amp;pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=UP of Kentucky|page=20ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 60 percent of white Virginians were part of a broad middle class that owned substantial farms. By the second generation, death rates from malaria and other local diseases had declined so much that a stable family structure was possible.

The bottom third owned no land and verged on poverty. Many were recent arrivals, recently released from indentured servitude.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Taylor, ''American Colonies: The Settling of North America'' (2002) p 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some districts near present-day Washington DC, 70 percent of the land was owned by a handful of families, and three fourths of the whites had no land at all. Large numbers of Irish and German Protestants had settled in the frontier districts, often moving down from Pennsylvania. Tobacco was not important here; farmers focused on hemp, grain, cattle, and horses. Entrepreneurs had begun to mine and smelt the local iron ores.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Selby, ''The Revolution in Virginia, 1775–1783'' (1988) p 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports occupied a great deal of attention at every social level, starting at the top.  In England, hunting was sharply restricted to landowners and enforced by armed gameskeepers. In America, game was more than plentiful. Everyone could and did hunt, including servants and slaves. Poor men with good rifle skills won praise; rich gentlemen who were off target won ridicule. In 1691, governor Sir [[Francis Nicholson]] organized competitions for the "better sort of Virginians onely who are Batchelors," and he offered prizes "to be shot for, wrastled, played at backswords, &amp; Run for by Horse and foott."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nancy L. Struna, "The Formalizing of Sport and the Formation of an Elite: The Chesapeake Gentry, 1650-1720s." ''Journal of Sport History'' 13#3 (1986) p 219. [http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1986/JSH1303/jsh1303c.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse racing was the main event. The typical farmer did not own a horse in the first place, and racing was a matter for gentlemen only, but ordinary farmers were spectators and gamblers. Selected slaves often became skilled horse trainers.  Horse racing was especially important for knitting together the gentry. The race was a major public event designed to demonstrate to the world the superior social status of the gentry through expensive breeding, training, boasting, and gambling, and especially winning the races themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Struna, ''The Formalizing of Sport and the Formation of an Elite'' pp 212-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Timothy Breen explains that horse racing and high-stakes gambling were essential to maintaining the status of the gentry. When they publicly bet a large sum on their favorite horse, it told the world that competitiveness, individualism, and materialism where the core elements of gentry values.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy H. Breen, "Horses and gentlemen: The cultural significance of gambling among the gentry of Virginia." ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1977) 34#2 pp: 239-257. [http://jpwhit.people.wm.edu/H150F2005/Breen_Horses_and_Gentlemen.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]] (1975) argues that Virginians in the 1650s and for the next two centuries turned to slavery and a [[racial segregation|racial divide]] as an alternative to class conflict.  "Racism made it possible for white Virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that English republicans had declared to be the soul of liberty." That is, white men became politically much more equal than was possible without a population of low-status slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Morgan, ''American Slavery, American Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia'' (1975) p 386&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1700, the Virginia population reached 70,000 and continued to grow rapidly from a high birth rate, low death rate, importation of slaves from the Caribbean, and immigration from Britain, Germany, and Pennsylvania. The climate was mild; the farm lands were cheap and fertile.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H Heinemann et al. ''Old Dominion, New Commonwealth: A history of Virginia 1607–2007'' (2007) pp 83–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carolinas ====
{{Main|History of South Carolina|History of North Carolina|Province of Carolina}}
The [[Province of Carolina]] was the first attempted English settlement south of Virginia. It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]] who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]]. The original settlers in South Carolina established a lucrative trade in food for the slave plantations in the Caribbean. The settlers came mainly from the English colony of [[Barbados]] and brought African slaves with them. Barbados was a wealthy [[sugarcane]] plantation island, one of the early English colonies to use large numbers of Africans in plantation-style agriculture. The cultivation of rice was introduced during the 1690s and became an important export crop.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Weir, ''Colonial South Carolina: A History'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, South Carolina was politically divided. Its ethnic makeup included the original settlers (a group of rich, slave-owning English settlers from the island of Barbados) and [[Huguenots]], a French-speaking community of Protestants. Nearly continuous frontier warfare during the era of [[King William's War]] and [[Queen Anne's War]] drove economic and political wedges between merchants and planters. The disaster of the 1715 [[Yamasee War]] threatened the colony's viability and set off a decade of political turmoil. By 1729, the [[Proprietary Governor|proprietary government]] had collapsed, and the Proprietors sold both colonies back to the British crown.&lt;ref name="ciment" /&gt;

North Carolina had the smallest upper-class. The richest 10 percent owned about 40 percent of all land, compared to 50 to 60 percent in neighboring Virginia and South Carolina. There were no cities of any size and very few towns, so there was scarcely an urban middle class at all. Heavily rural North Carolina was dominated by subsistence farmers with small operations. In addition, one fourth of the whites had no land at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson Turner Main|title=Social Structure of Revolutionary America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TkjWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9|year=1965|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Talmage Lefler, and William Stevens Powell, ''Colonial North Carolina: A History'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Georgia ====
{{Main|Province of Georgia}}

[[File:SavannahColony.JPG|thumb|Savannah, [[Georgia Colony]], early 18th century]]
British [[Member of Parliament]] [[James Oglethorpe]] established the [[Georgia Colony]] in 1733 as a solution to two problems. At that time, tension was high between Spain and Great Britain, and the British feared that Spanish Florida was threatening the British Carolinas. Oglethorpe decided to establish a colony in the contested border region of Georgia and to populate it with debtors who would otherwise have been imprisoned according to standard British practice. This plan would both rid Great Britain of its undesirable elements and provide her with a base from which to attack Florida. The first colonists arrived in 1733.&lt;ref name="ciment" /&gt;

Georgia was established on strict moralistic principles. Slavery was officially forbidden, as were alcohol and other forms of immorality. However, the reality of the colony was far different. The colonists rejected a moralistic lifestyle and complained that their colony could not compete economically with the Carolina rice plantations. Georgia initially failed to prosper, but eventually the restrictions were lifted, slavery was allowed, and it became as prosperous as the Carolinas. The colony of Georgia never had an established religion; it consisted of people of various faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Coleman, Kenneth. Colonial Georgia: a history (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== East and West Florida ====
{{Main|British Florida|East Florida|West Florida}}
Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain in 1763, which established the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. The Floridas remained loyal to Great Britain during the [[American Revolution]]. They were returned to Spain in 1783 in exchange for the [[Bahamas]], at which time most of the British left. The Spanish then neglected the Floridas; few Spaniards lived there when the US bought the area in 1819.&lt;ref name="Cooke 1998" /&gt;

== Unification of the British colonies ==

=== Colonial wars: a common defense ===
{{Main|Colonial American military history}}
Efforts began as early as the 1640s toward a common defense of the colonies, principally against shared threats from Indians, the French, and the Dutch. The Puritan colonies of New England formed [[New England Confederation|a confederation]] to coordinate military and judicial matters. From the 1670s, several royal governors attempted to find means of coordinating defensive and offensive military matters, notably Sir [[Edmund Andros]] (who governed New York, New England, and Virginia at various times) and [[Francis Nicholson]] (governed Maryland, Virginia, Nova Scotia, and Carolina). After [[King Phillips War]], Andros successfully negotiated the [[Covenant Chain]], a series of Indian treaties that brought relative calm to the frontiers of the middle colonies for many years.

The northern colonies experienced numerous assaults from the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] and the French from [[Acadia]] during the four [[French and Indian Wars]], particularly present-day [[Maine]] and [[New Hampshire]], as well as [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]].
[[File:Louisbourg assiegee en 1745.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)]] by [[Peter Monamy]]]]

One event that reminded colonists of their shared identity as British subjects was the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–1748) in Europe. This conflict spilled over into the colonies, where it was known as "[[King George's War]]". The major battles took place in Europe, but American colonial troops fought the French and their Indian allies in New York, New England, and Nova Scotia with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)]].

At the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754, [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed that the colonies be united by a Grand Council overseeing a common policy for defense, expansion, and Indian affairs. The plan was thwarted by colonial legislatures and [[George II of England|King George II]], but it was an early indication that the British colonies of North America were headed towards unification.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Brands, ''The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== French and Indian War ====
{{Main|French and Indian War}}
[[File:WashingtonFIwar.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]] during the [[French and Indian War]]]]
[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s political cartoon ''[[Join, or Die]]'' called for colonial unity during the French and Indian War, and was used again during the American Revolution.]]
The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]]. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a "[[world war]]". During the war, the position of the British colonies as part of the [[British Empire]] was made truly apparent, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in the lives of Americans.

The war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still "American". Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained American ones for battle, most notably [[George Washington]], which benefitted the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively, for the first time, in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; The relations between the British military establishment and the colonists were not always positive, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops.
[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|left|300px|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War: land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink.]]

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.

The British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;

=== Ties to the British Empire ===
The colonies were very different from one another but they were still a part of the [[British Empire]] in more than just name. Demographically, the majority of the colonists traced their roots to the British Isles and many of them still had family ties with Great Britain.  Socially, the colonial elite of [[Boston]], New York, Charleston, and [[Philadelphia]] saw their identity as British. Many had never lived in Britain in over a few generations, yet they imitated British styles of dress, dance, and etiquette. This social upper echelon built its mansions in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]], copied the furniture designs of [[Thomas Chippendale]], and participated in the intellectual currents of Europe, such as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The [[seaport]] cities of colonial America were truly British cities in the eyes of many inhabitants.&lt;ref name="vickers"&gt;Daniel Vickers, ed. ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006), ch 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Republicanism ====
Many of the [[colonial government in America|political structures of the colonies]] drew upon the [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] expressed by opposition leaders in Britain, most notably the [[Commonwealth men]] and the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] traditions. Many Americans at the time saw the colonies' systems of governance as modeled after the [[British constitution]] of the time, with the king corresponding to the governor, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] to the [[colonial assembly]], and the [[House of Lords]] to the [[governor's council]]. The codes of law of the colonies were often drawn directly from [[English and Welsh law|English law]]; indeed, English [[common law]] survives not only in Canada, but also throughout the United States. Eventually, it was a dispute over the meaning of some of these political ideals (especially [[political representation]]) and [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] that led to the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1967); Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds. ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumption of British goods ====
Another point on which the colonies found themselves more similar than different was the booming import of British goods. The British economy had begun to grow rapidly at the end of the 17th century and, by the mid-18th century, small factories in Britain were producing much more than the nation could consume. Britain found a market for their goods in the British colonies of North America, increasing her exports to that region by 360% between 1740 and 1770. British merchants offered [[credit (finance)|credit]] to their customers;&lt;ref name=origins&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=John C|title=Origins of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlmrAAAAIAAJ|publisher=Stanford University Press|accessdate=20 April 2016|language=English|date=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; this allowed Americans to buy a large amount of British goods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} From [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], all British subjects bought similar products, creating and anglicizing a sort of common identity.&lt;ref name="vickers" /&gt;

=== Atlantic world ===
In recent years, historians have enlarged their perspective to cover the entire Atlantic world in a subfield now known as [[Atlantic history]].&lt;ref&gt;David Armitage and Michael J. Braddick, eds., ''The British Atlantic World, 1500–1800'' (2002);&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison. Games, "Atlantic History: Definitions, Challenges, and Opportunities," ''American Historical Review,'' June 2006, Vol. 111 Issue 3, pp 741–757&lt;/ref&gt; Of special interest are such themes as international migration, trade, colonization, comparative military and governmental institutions, the transmission of religions and missionary work, and the slave trade. It was the [[Age of the Enlightenment]], and ideas flowed back and forth across the Atlantic, with Philadelphian [[Benjamin Franklin]] playing a major role.

Francois Furstenberg (2008) offers a different perspective on the historical period. He suggests that warfare was critical among the major imperial players: Britain, the American colonies, Spain, France, and the First Nations (Indians). They fought a series of conflicts from 1754 to 1815 that Furstenberg calls a "Long War for the West" over control of the region.&lt;ref&gt;François Furstenberg, "The Significance of the Trans-Appalachian Frontier in Atlantic History," ''American Historical Review,'' June 2008, Vol. 113 Issue 3, pp 647–677,&lt;/ref&gt;

Women played a role in the emergence of the capitalist economy in the Atlantic world. The types of local commercial exchange in which they participated independently were well integrated with the trade networks between colonial merchants throughout the Atlantic region, especially markets in dairy and produce commodities. For example, local women merchants were important suppliers of foodstuffs to transatlantic shipping concerns.&lt;ref&gt;James E.. McWilliams, "Butter, Milk, and a 'Spare Ribb': Women's Work and the Transatlantic Economic Transition in Seventeenth-Century Massachusetts," ''New England Quarterly,'' March 2009, Vol. 82 Issue 1, pp 5–24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growing dissent and the American Revolution ===
{{Main|American Revolution}}
In the colonial era, Americans insisted on their rights as Englishmen to have their own legislature raise all taxes. The British Parliament, however, asserted in 1765 that it held supreme authority to lay taxes, and a series of American protests began that led directly to the American Revolution. The first wave of protests attacked the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], and marked the first time that Americans met together from each of the 13 colonies and planned a common front against British taxation. The [[Boston Tea Party]] of 1773 dumped British tea into Boston Harbor because it contained a hidden tax that Americans refused to pay. The British responded by trying to crush traditional liberties in Massachusetts, leading to the American revolution starting in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Slaughter, "The Tax Man Cometh: Ideological Opposition to Internal Taxes, 1760–1790," ''William and Mary Quarterly'' Vol. 41, No. 4 (October 1984), pp. 566–591 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1919154 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of independence steadily became more widespread, after being first proposed and advocated by a number of public figures and commentators throughout the Colonies. One of the most prominent voices on behalf of independence was [[Thomas Paine]] in his pamphlet [[Common Sense]] published in 1776. Another group which called for independence was the [[Sons of Liberty]], which had been founded in 1765 in [[Boston]] by [[Samuel Adams]] and which was now becoming even more strident and numerous.

The Parliament began a series of taxes and punishments which met more and more resistance: First [[Quartering Act]] (1765); [[Declaratory Act]] (1766); [[Townshend Revenue Act]] (1767); and [[Tea Act]] (1773). In response to the Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the [[Intolerable Acts]]: Second [[Quartering Act]] (1774); [[Quebec Act]] (1774); [[Massachusetts Government Act]] (1774); [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]] (1774); [[Boston Port Act]] (1774); [[Prohibitory Act]] (1775). By this point, the 13 colonies had organized themselves into the [[Continental Congress]] and begun setting up independent governments and drilling their militia in preparation for war.&lt;ref&gt;Francis D. Cogliano, ''Revolutionary America, 1763–1815; A Political History'' (2nd ed. 2008) pp 49–76&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonial life ==

=== British colonial government ===
In the British colonies, the three forms of government were provincial ([[royal colony]]), proprietary, and charter. These governments were all subordinate to the King of England, with no explicit relationship with the British [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]]. Beginning late in the 17th century, the administration of all British colonies was overseen by the [[Board of Trade]] in London. Each colony had a paid [[colonial agent]] in London to represent its interests.

New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and eventually Massachusetts were [[crown colony|crown colonies]]. The provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and (in some provinces) his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of England. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation.

Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were [[Proprietary colony|proprietary colonies]]. They were governed much as royal colonies except that lord proprietors, rather than the king, appointed the governor. They were set up after the [[English Restoration|Restoration of 1660]] and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty.&lt;ref&gt;John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were [[charter colony|charter colonies]]. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691. Charter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2QIGe_0PYqsC online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political culture ====
The primary [[Political culture of the United States|political cultures]] of the United States had their origins in the colonial period. Most theories of political culture identify New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South as having formed separate and distinct political cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Ashley Cooper Plan: The Founding of Carolina and the Origins of Southern Political Culture''. Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2016. 142-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bonomi (1971) shows, the most distinctive feature of colonial society was the vibrant political culture, which attracted the most talented and ambitious young men into politics.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) p 281&lt;/ref&gt; First, suffrage was the most generous in the world, with every man allowed to vote who owned a certain amount of property.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689–1776'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than one-percent of British men could vote, whereas a majority of American freemen were eligible. The roots of democracy were present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pole | first1 = J. R. | year = 1962 | title = Historians and the Problem of Early American Democracy | url = | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 67 | issue = 3| pages = 626–46 | doi = 10.2307/1844105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections.&lt;ref&gt;Richard R. Beeman, "The Varieties of Deference in Eighteenth-Century America," ''Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Volume 3#2 Fall 2005, pp. 311–340&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, a very wide range of public and private business was decided by elected bodies in the colonies, especially the assemblies and county governments in each colony.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) pp 281–2&lt;/ref&gt; They handled land grants, commercial subsidies, and taxation, as well as oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schools.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, ''Encyclopedia of the North American Colonies'' (1993) vol 1 pp 341–62, 391–402; 435–39&lt;/ref&gt; Americans sued each other at a very high rate, with binding decisions made not by a great lord but by local judges and juries. This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession, so that the intense involvement of lawyers in politics became an American characteristic by the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton-Hermann Chroust]], ''The Rise of the Legal Profession in America: Volume 1, The Colonial Experience'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the American colonies were exceptional in the world because of the representation of many different interest groups in political decision-making. The American political culture was open to economic, social, religious, ethnic, and geographical interests, with merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch Irish]], Yankees, Yorkers, and many other identifiable groups taking part. Elected representatives learned to listen to these interests because 90% of the men in the lower houses lived in their districts, unlike England where it was common to have an absentee member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, ''A Factious People'', p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; All of this was very unlike Europe, where aristocratic families and the established church were in control.

Finally and most dramatically, the Americans were fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]] which stressed equal rights, the need for virtuous citizens, and the evils of corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, ''A Factious People'', pp 281–286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the historiography, see Alan Tully, "Colonial Politics," in Daniel Vickers ed.  ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (Blackwell, 2006) pp 288–310&lt;/ref&gt; Republicanism provided the framework for colonial resistance to British schemes of taxation after 1763, which escalated into the Revolution.

None of the colonies had stable political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for power, especially in the perennial battles between the appointed governor and the elected assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Jack P. Greene, ''Peripheries and Center: Constitutional Development in the Extended Polities of the British Empire and the United States, 1607–1788'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; There were often "country" and "court" factions, representing those opposed to the governor's agenda and those in favor of it, respectively. Massachusetts had particularly low requirements for voting eligibility and strong rural representation in its assembly from its 1691 charter; consequently, it also had a strong populist faction that represented the province's lower classes.

Up and down the colonies, non-English ethnic groups had clusters of settlements. The most numerous were the Scotch Irish&lt;ref&gt;James Graham Leyburn, ''The Scotch-Irish: A Social History'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Spencer Fogleman, ''Hopeful Journeys: German Immigration, Settlement and Political Culture in Colonial America, 1717–1775'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Each group assimilated into the dominant English, Protestant, commercial, and political culture, albeit with local variations. They tended to vote in blocs, and politicians negotiated with group leaders for votes. They generally retained their historic languages and cultural traditions, even as they merged into the developing American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jack P. Greene, "'Pluribus' or 'Unum?' White Ethnicity in the Formation of Colonial American Culture," ''History Now,'' 1998, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp 1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocultural factors were most visible in Pennsylvania. During 1756–76, the Quakers were the largest faction in the legislature, but they were losing their dominance to the growing Presbyterian faction based on Scotch-Irish votes, supported by Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne L. Bockelman, and Owen S. Ireland, "The Internal Revolution in Pennsylvania: An Ethnic-Religious Interpretation," ''Pennsylvania History,'' March 1974, Vol. 41 Issue 2, pp 125–159&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical conditions ===
{{Main|Disease in colonial America|History of medicine in the United States}}
Mortality was very high for new arrivals, and high for children in the colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Jo Tannenbaum, ''Health and Wellness in Colonial America'' (ABC-CLIO, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Viets, "Some Features of the History of Medicine in Massachusetts during the Colonial Period, 1620-1770," ''Isis'' (1935), 23:389-405&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malaria]] was deadly to many new arrivals in the Southern colonies. For an example of newly arrived able-bodied young men, over one-fourth of the Anglican missionaries died within five years of their arrival in the Carolinas.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford J. Wood, "'A Constant Attendance on God's {{Not a typo|Alter}}': Death, Disease, and the Anglican Church in Colonial South Carolina, 1706-1750," ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'' (1999) 100#3 pp. 204-220 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27570385 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortality was high for infants and small children, especially from diphtheria, yellow fever, and malaria. Most sick people turned to local healers and used folk remedies. Others relied upon the minister-physicians, barber-surgeons, apothecaries, midwives, and ministers; a few used colonial physicians trained either in Britain or an apprenticeship in the colonies. There was little government control, regulation of medical care, or attention to public health. Colonial physicians introduced modern medicine to the cities in the 18th century, following the models in England and Scotland, and made some advances in vaccination, pathology, anatomy, and pharmacology.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Shryock, "Eighteenth Century Medicine in America," ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'' (Oct 1949) 59#2 pp 275-292. [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44807198.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Main|History of religion in the United States}}
The religious history of the United States began with the first Pilgrim settlers who came on the [[Mayflower]] in 1620. Their Puritan faith motivated their move from Europe. The [[New Spain|Spanish]] set up a network of Catholic missions in California, but they had all closed decades before 1848 when California became part of the U.S. There were a few important [[Louisiana (New France)|French]] Catholic churches and institutions in [[New Orleans]].

Most of the settlers came from Protestant backgrounds in England and Western Europe, with a small proportion of Catholics (chiefly in Maryland) and a few [[Jews]] in port cities. The English and the [[German Americans|Germans]] brought along multiple Protestant denominations. Several colonies had an "established" church, which meant that local tax money went to the established denomination. [[Religious freedom|Freedom of religion]] became a basic American principle, and numerous new movements emerged, many of which became established denominations in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Politics in Colonial America'' (1986) [https://www.amazon.com/Under-Cope-Heaven-Religion-Politics-ebook/dp/B000S1L622/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Puritans]] of New England kept in close touch with nonconformists in England,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Of Plymouth Plantation]]'' by William Bradford.&lt;/ref&gt; as did the [[Quakers]]&lt;ref&gt;see [[History of the Religious Society of Friends]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Methodists.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (1972) pp 121-384 [https://www.amazon.com/Religious-History-American-People/dp/0300100124/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England (Anglican) was officially established in five Southern colonies, which meant that local taxes paid the salary of the clergy. The parish had civic responsibilities such as poor relief.&lt;ref&gt;Anglican clergy in the southern colonies were commonly referred to as "ministers" to distinguish them from Roman Catholic priests—although they were actually ordained as priests, unlike other Protestants.&lt;/ref&gt; The local gentry controlled the budget, rather than the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Religion in early Virginia]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown never appointed a bishop in the American colonies because of resistance from other churches. Anglicans in America were under the authority of the Bishop of London. He sent out missionaries from England and ordained men from the Colonies to minister there in parishes.&lt;ref&gt;John Nelson, ''A Blessed Company: Parishes, Parsons, and Parishioners in Anglican Virginia, 1690–1776'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Mitre and Sceptre: Transatlantic Faiths, Ideas, Personalities, and Politics, 1689–1775'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians debate how influential Christianity was in the era of the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Steven K. Green, ''Inventing a Christian America: The Myth of the Religious Founding'' (2015) with Thomas S. Kidd, ''God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the founding fathers were active in a local church; some of them had Deist sentiments, such as Jefferson, Franklin, and Washington.

Catholics were few outside of Maryland; however, they played the Patriot role during the Revolution. Leaders such as George Washington strongly endorsed tolerance for them and indeed for all denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Emmett Curran, ''Papist Devils: Catholics in British America, 1574–1783'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Great Awakening ====
{{Main|First Great Awakening}}
The [[First Great Awakening]] was the nation's first major religious revival, occurring in the middle of the 18th century, and it injected new vigor into Christian faith. It was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants that swept the colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American religion. [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] was a key leader and a powerful intellectual in colonial America. [[George Whitefield]] came over from England and made many converts.

The Great Awakening emphasized the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep awareness of personal sin and redemption by Christ Jesus, spurred on by powerful preaching that deeply affected listeners.  Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made religion personal to the average person.&lt;ref&gt;John Howard Smith, ''The First Great Awakening: Redefining Religion in British America, 1725–1775'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awakening had a major impact in reshaping the [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]], and German Reformed denominations, and it strengthened the small [[Baptist]] and [[Methodism|Methodist]] denominations. It brought Christianity to the slaves and was a powerful event in New England that challenged established authority. It incited rancor and division between the new revivalists and the old traditionalists who insisted on ritual and liturgy. The Awakening had little impact on Anglicans and [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]].

The First Great Awakening focused on people who were already church members, unlike the [[Second Great Awakening]] that began around 1800 and reached out to the unchurched. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness. The new style of sermons and the way that people practiced their faith breathed new life into [[religion in the United States|religion in America]]. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their religion, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. Ministers who used this new style of preaching were generally called "new lights", while the traditional-styled preachers were called "old lights".

People began to study the Bible at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious manners and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (Yale University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women's roles ===
{{See also|Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies}}
The experiences of women varied greatly from colony to colony during the colonial era. In New England, the Puritan settlers brought their strong religious values with them to the New World, which dictated that a woman be submissive to her husband and dedicate herself to rearing God-fearing children to the best of her ability.

There were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Thatcher Ulrich,  "Of pens and needles: sources in early American women's history." ''Journal of American History'' 77.1 (1990): 200-207. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2078652 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-18th century, the values of the [[American Enlightenment]] became established and weakened the view that husbands were natural "rulers" over their wives. There was a new sense of shared marriage.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Legally, husbands took control of wives' property when marrying. Divorce was almost impossible until the late eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, ''First Generations: Women in Colonial America'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
{{Main|Slavery in the colonial United States}}

Slaves transported to America:&lt;ref&gt;Source: Miller and Smith, eds. ''Dictionary of American Slavery'' (1988) p . 678&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1620–1700.....21,000
* 1701–1760....189,000
* 1761–1770.....63,000
* 1771–1790.....56,000
* 1791–1800.....79,000

* 1810–1865.....51,000
*  Total ..........597,000

About 600,000 slaves were transported to America, or 5% of the 12 million slaves taken from Africa. The great majority went to sugarcane-growing colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished. Life expectancy was much greater in the American colonies because of better food, less disease, lighter work loads, and better medical care, so the population grew rapidly, reaching 4 million by the 1860 Census. From 1770 until 1860, the birth rate of American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that of England.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tadman, "The Demographic Cost of Sugar: Debates on Slave Societies and Natural Increase in the Americas," ''The American Historical Review'' Dec. 2000 105:5 [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.5/ah001534.html online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123011608/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.5/ah001534.html |date=2011-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New England ===
In New England, the Puritans created self-governing communities of religious congregations of farmers (or [[yeoman|yeomen]]) and their families. High-level politicians gave out plots of land to settlers (or proprietors) who then divided the land amongst themselves. Large portions were usually given to men of higher social standing, but every man who wasn't indentured or criminally bonded had enough land to support a family. Every male citizen had a voice in the town meeting. The town meeting levied taxes, built roads, and elected officials who managed town affairs. The towns did not have courts; that was a function of the county, whose officials were appointed by the state government.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth A. Lockridge, ''A New England Town, The First Hundred Years: Dedham, Massachusetts, 1636–1736'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congregational Church]] which the Puritans founded was not automatically joined by all New England residents because of Puritan beliefs that [[God]] singled out specific people for salvation. Instead, membership was limited to those who could convincingly "test" before members of the church that they had been saved. They were known as "the elect" or "Saints."&lt;!---following clause hidden b/c it does not give a date; Puritans made up 100% of the British population in 1620, so more specific info req'd if this is to be unhidden: and made up less than 40% of the population of New England.---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Conforti, ''Saints and Strangers: New England in British North America'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Farm and family life ====
A majority of New England residents were small farmers. A man had complete power over the property within these small farm families.

When married, an English woman gave up her maiden name. The role of wives was to raise and nurture healthy children and support their husbands. Most women carried out these duties.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund S. Morgan, ''The Puritan Family: Religion and Domestic Relations in Seventeenth-Century New England'' (1966) [https://www.amazon.com/Puritan-Family-Religion-Relations-Seventeenth-Century/dp/0061312274/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century, couples usually married between the ages of 20-24, and 6-8 children were typical of a family, with three on average surviving to adulthood. Farm women provided most of the materials needed by the rest of the family by spinning yarn from wool and knitting sweaters and stockings, making candles and soap from ashes, and churning milk into butter.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Donahue, ''The Great Meadow: Farmers and the Land in Colonial Concord'' (Yale Agrarian Studies Series) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GROWTH1850.JPG|thumb|450px|long-term economic growth]]

Most New England parents tried to help their sons establish farms of their own. When sons married, fathers gave them gifts of land, livestock, or farming equipment; daughters received household goods, farm animals, or cash. [[Arranged marriages]] were very unusual; normally, children chose their own spouses from within a circle of suitable acquaintances who shared their race, religion, and social standing. Parents retained veto power over their children's marriages.

New England farming families generally lived in wooden houses because of the abundance of trees. A typical New England farmhouse was one-and-a-half stories tall and had a strong frame (usually made of large square timbers) that was covered by wooden clapboard siding. A large chimney stood in the middle of the house that provided cooking facilities and warmth during the winter. One side of the ground floor contained a hall, a general-purpose room where the family worked and ate meals. Adjacent to the hall was the parlor, a room used to entertain guests that contained the family's best furnishings and the parents' bed. Children slept in a loft above, while the kitchen was either part of the hall or was located in a shed along the back of the house. Colonial families were large, and these small dwellings had much activity and there was little privacy.

By the middle of the 18th century, New England's population had grown dramatically, going from about 100,000 people in 1700 to 250,000 in 1725 and 375,000 in 1750 thanks to high birth rates and relatively high overall life expectancy. (A 15-year-old boy in 1700 could expect to live to about 63.) Colonists in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island continued to subdivide their land between farmers; the farms became too small to support single families, and this threatened the New England ideal of a society of independent yeoman farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Percy Wells Bidwell, ''Rural economy in New England at the beginning of the nineteenth century'' (1916) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6P8YAAAAYAAJ full text online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some farmers obtained land grants to create farms in undeveloped land in Massachusetts and Connecticut or bought plots of land from speculators in New Hampshire and what later became Vermont. Other farmers became agricultural innovators. They planted nutritious English grass such as [[red clover]] and [[timothy-grass]], which provided more feed for livestock, and potatoes, which provided a high production rate that was an advantage for small farms. Families increased their productivity by exchanging goods and labor with each other. They lent livestock and grazing land to one another and worked together to spin yarn, sew quilts, and shuck corn. Migration, agricultural innovation, and economic cooperation were creative measures that preserved New England's yeoman society until the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==== Town life ====
[[File:Saltbox side elevation.png|thumb|[[Saltbox]]-style homes originated in [[New England]] after 1650]]

By the mid-18th century in New England, shipbuilding was a staple, particularly as the North American wilderness offered a seemingly endless supply of timber. (By comparison, Europe's forests had been depleted, and most timber had to be purchased from Scandinavia.) The British crown often turned to the inexpensive yet strongly built American ships. There was a shipyard at the mouth of almost every river in New England.

By 1750, a variety of artisans, shopkeepers, and merchants provided services to the growing farming population. [[Blacksmith]]s, [[wheelwright]]s, and furniture makers set up shops in [[rural]] villages. There they built and repaired goods needed by farm families. Stores were set up by traders selling English manufactures such as cloth, iron utensils, and window glass, as well as [[West Indies|West Indian]] products such as sugar and [[molasses]]. The storekeepers of these shops sold their imported goods in exchange for crops and other local products, including [[roof shingle]]s, [[potash]], and [[barrel]] staves. These local goods were shipped to towns and cities all along the Atlantic Coast. Enterprising men set up [[stable]]s and [[tavern]]s along wagon roads to serve this transportation system.

These products were delivered to port towns such as [[Boston]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in Massachusetts, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] in Connecticut, and [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] in Rhode Island. Merchants then exported them to the West Indies, where they were traded for molasses, sugar, gold coins, and bills of exchange (credit slips). They carried the West Indian products to New England factories, where the raw sugar was turned into granulated sugar and the molasses distilled into [[rum]]. The gold and credit slips were sent to England where they were exchanged for manufactures, which were shipped back to the colonies and sold along with the sugar and rum to farmers.

Other New England merchants took advantage of the rich fishing areas along the Atlantic Coast and financed a large fishing fleet, transporting its catch of [[mackerel]] and [[cod]] to the West Indies and Europe. Some merchants exploited the vast amounts of timber along the coasts and rivers of northern New England. They funded [[sawmill]]s that supplied cheap wood for houses and shipbuilding. Hundreds of New England shipwrights built oceangoing ships, which they sold to British and American merchants.

Many merchants became very wealthy by providing their goods to the agricultural population, and ended up dominating the society of sea port cities. Unlike yeoman farmhouses, these merchants lived in elegant {{frac|2|1|2}}-story houses designed in the new Georgian style, imitating the lifestyle of the upper class of England. These Georgian houses had a symmetrical façade with equal numbers of windows on both sides of the central door. The interior consisted of a passageway down the middle of the house with specialized rooms off the sides, such as a library, dining room, formal parlor, and master bedroom. Unlike the multi-purpose space of the yeoman houses, each of these rooms served a separate purpose. These houses contained bedrooms on the second floor that provided privacy to parents and children.

==== Culture and education ====
{{Main|History of education in the United States#Colonial Era|Education in Colonial America}}
Education was primarily the responsibility of families, but numerous religious groups established tax-supported elementary schools, especially the Puritans in New England, so that their children could read the Bible. Nearly all the religious denominations set up their own schools and colleges to train ministers. Each city and most towns had private academies for the children of affluent families.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence A. Cremin, ''American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607–1783'' (Harper, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University.JPG|thumb|[[Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University|Massachusetts Hall]], oldest building at [[Harvard University]], built 1718–1720 as a dormitory]]

The practical sciences were of great interest to colonial Americans, who were engaged in the process of taming and settling a wild frontier country. The mainstream of intellectual activity in the colonies was on technological and engineering developments rather than more abstract topics such as politics or metaphysics. American scientific activity was pursued by such people as:
* [[David Rittenhouse]], who constructed the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere
* New York lieutenant governor [[Cadwallader Colden]], botanist and anthropologist
* Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]], physician, social reformer, and member of the American Philosophical Society
* [[Benjamin Franklin]], founder of the above American Philosophical society who contributed important discoveries to physics such as electricity, but was more successful in his practical inventions, such as stoves and lightning rods

The arts in colonial America were not as successful as the sciences. Literature in the European sense was nearly nonexistent, with histories being far more noteworthy. These included ''The History and present State of Virginia'' (1705) by [[Robert Beverley, Jr.|Robert Beverly]] and ''History of the Dividing Line'' (1728–29) by [[William Byrd]], which was not published until a century later. Instead, the newspaper was the principal form of reading material in the colonies. Printing was expensive, and most publications focused on purely practical matters, such as major news, advertisements, and business reports. Almanacs were very popular, also, Benjamin Franklin's ''Poor Richard's Almanac'' being the most famous. Literary magazines appeared at mid-century, but few were profitable and most went out of business after only a few years. American publications never approached the intellectual quality of European writers, but they were much more widespread and achieved a greater readership than anything produced by Voltaire, Locke, or Rousseau.

New Englanders wrote journals, pamphlets, books, and especially sermons—more than all of the other colonies combined. Boston minister [[Cotton Mather]] published ''[[Magnalia Christi Americana]]'' (The Great Works of Christ in America, 1702), while revivalist Jonathan Edwards wrote his philosophical work ''A Careful and Strict Enquiry Into...Notions of...Freedom of Will...'' (1754). Most music had a religious theme, as well, and was mainly the singing of [[Psalm]]s. Because of New England's deep religious beliefs, artistic works that were insufficiently religious or too "worldly" were banned, especially the theater. The leading theologian and philosopher of the colonial era was [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] of Massachusetts, an interpreter of Calvinism and the leader of the [[First Great Awakening]].

Art and drama were somewhat more successful than literature. [[Benjamin West]] was a noteworthy painter of historical subjects, and two first-rate portrait painters emerged in [[John Singleton Copley|John Copley]] and [[Gilbert Stuart]], yet all three men spent much of their lives in London. Theater was more developed in the Southern colonies, especially South Carolina, but nowhere did stage works attain the level of Europe. Puritans in New England and Quakers in Pennsylvania opposed theatrical performances as immoral and ungodly.

Elementary education was widespread in New England. Early Puritan settlers believed that it was necessary to study the Bible, so children were taught to read at an early age. It was also required that each town pay for a primary school. About 10 percent enjoyed secondary schooling and funded [[grammar school]]s in larger towns. Most boys learned skills from their fathers on the farm or as apprentices to artisans. Few girls attended formal schools, but most were able to get some education at home or at so-called "Dame schools" where women taught basic reading and writing skills in their own houses. By 1750, nearly 90% of New England's women and almost all of its men could read and write.

Puritans founded [[Harvard College]] in 1636 and [[Yale College]] in 1701. Later, Baptists founded [[Rhode Island College]] (now [[Brown University]]) in 1764 and Congregationalists established [[Dartmouth College]] in 1769. Virginia founded the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1693; it was primarily Anglican. The colleges were designed for aspiring ministers, lawyers, or doctors. There were no departments or majors, as every student shared the same curriculum, which focused on Latin and Greek, mathematics, and history, philosophy, logic, ethics, rhetoric, oratory, and a little basic science. There were no sports or fraternities and few extracurricular activities apart from literary societies. There were no separate seminaries, law schools, or divinity schools. The first medical schools were founded late in the colonial era in Philadelphia and New York.&lt;ref&gt;Cremin, ''American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607–1783'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Religion ====
Some emigrants who came to Colonial America were in search of religious freedom. London did not make the Church of England official in the colonies—it never sent a bishop—so religious practice became diverse.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 2004) ch 17–22&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]]'' was a major religious revival movement that took place in most colonies in the 1730s and 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 2004) ch 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; The movement began with [[Jonathan Edwards (theology)|Jonathan Edwards]], a Massachusetts preacher who sought to return to the Pilgrims' [[Calvinist]] roots and to reawaken the "Fear of God." English preacher [[George Whitefield]] and other itinerant preachers continued the movement, traveling throughout the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style. Followers of Edwards and other preachers called themselves the "New Lights", as contrasted with the "Old Lights" who disapproved of their movement. To promote their viewpoints, the two sides established academies and colleges, including [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Williams College]]. The Great Awakening has been called the first truly American event.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Jon Butler]] has questioned the concept of a Great Awakening, but most historians use it. {{cite journal

A similar pietistic revival movement took place among some German and Dutch settlers, leading to more divisions. By the 1770s, the Baptists were growing rapidly both in the north (where they founded [[Brown University]]) and in the South (where they challenged the previously unquestioned [[moral authority]] of the Anglican establishment).

=== Delaware Valley and Mid-Atlantic region ===
Unlike New England, the Mid-Atlantic region gained much of its population from new immigration and, by 1750, the combined populations of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]] had reached nearly 300,000 people. By 1750, about 60,000 Irish and 50,000 [[German American|Germans]] came to live in British North America, many of them settling in the Mid-Atlantic Region. [[William Penn]] founded the colony of Pennsylvania in 1682, and attracted an influx of British Quakers with his policies of religious liberty and freehold ownership. ("Freehold" meant owning land free and clear, with the right to resell it to anyone.) The first major influx of settlers were the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch Irish]] who headed to the frontier. Many Germans came to escape the religious conflicts and declining economic opportunities in Germany and Switzerland.

Thousands of poor German farmers, chiefly from the Palatine region of Germany,  migrated to upstate districts after 1700. They kept to themselves, married their own, spoke German, attended Lutheran churches, and retained their own customs and foods. They emphasized farm ownership.  Some mastered English to become conversant with local legal and business opportunities. They ignored the Indians and tolerated slavery (although few were rich enough to own a slave).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Otterness, ''Becoming German: The 1709 Palatine Migration to New York'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ways of life ====

[[File:Grumblethorpe Tennant.JPG|thumb|left|[[Grumblethorpe Tenant House]], [[Germantown, Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, where 80 percent of the buildings were made entirely of stone.]]

Much of the architecture of the Middle Colonies reflects the diversity of its people. In [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and New York City, a majority of the buildings were Dutch style with brick exteriors and high gables at each end, while many Dutch churches were octagonal. German and Welsh settlers in Pennsylvania used cut stone to build their houses, following the way of their homeland and completely ignoring the plethora of timber in the area. An example of this would be [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]], Pennsylvania where 80 percent of the buildings in the town were made entirely of stone. On the other hand, settlers from Ireland took advantage of America's ample supply of timber and constructed sturdy [[log cabin]]s.

Ethnic cultures also affected styles of furniture. Rural Quakers preferred simple designs in furnishings such as tables, chairs, and chests, and shunned elaborate decorations. However, some urban Quakers had much more elaborate furniture. The city of [[Philadelphia]] became a major center of furniture-making because of its massive wealth from Quaker and British merchants. Philadelphian cabinet makers built elegant desks and [[highboy]]s. German artisans created intricate carved designs on their chests and other furniture, with painted scenes of flowers and birds. German potters also crafted a large array of jugs, pots, and plates of both elegant and traditional design.

By the time of the Revolutionary War, approximately 85 percent of white Americans were of English, Irish, Welsh, or Scottish descent. Approximately 8.8 percent of whites were of German ancestry, and 3.5 percent were of Dutch origin.

==== Farming ====

{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
Ethnicity made a difference in agricultural practice. As an example, German farmers generally preferred [[oxen]] rather than horses to pull their plows and Scots-Irish made a farming economy based on hogs and corn. Eventually cows were brought with the horses. They were more useful than horses for many reasons. Almost all the farms had cows on their land. In Ireland, people farmed intensively, working small pieces of land trying to get the largest possible production-rate from their crops. In the American colonies, settlers from northern Ireland focused on mixed-farming. Using this technique, they grew corn for human consumption and as feed for hogs and other livestock. Many improvement-minded farmers of all different backgrounds began using new agricultural practices to raise their output. During the 1750s, these agricultural innovators replaced the hand sickles and [[scythe]]s used to harvest [[hay]], [[wheat]], and [[barley]] with the cradle scythe, a tool with wooden fingers that arranged the stalks of grain for easy collection. This tool was able to triple the amount of work done by farmers in one day. Farmers also began fertilizing their fields with [[Feces|dung]] and [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[crop rotation|rotating their crops]] to keep the soil fertile. By 1700, Philadelphia was exporting 350,000 bushels of wheat and 18,000 tons of flour annually. The Southern colonies in particular relied on cash crops such as tobacco and cotton. South Carolina produced rice and indigo. North Carolina was somewhat less involved in the plantation economy, but because a major producer of naval stores. Virginia and Maryland came to be almost totally dependent on tobacco, which would ultimately prove fatal at the end of the 18th century thanks to exhausted soil and collapsing prices, but for most of the century, the soil remained good and a single-crop economy profitable.

Before 1720, most colonists in the mid-Atlantic region worked with small-scale farming and paid for imported manufactures by supplying the West Indies with corn and flour. In New York, a fur-pelt export trade to Europe flourished adding additional wealth to the region. After 1720, mid-Atlantic farming stimulated with the international demand for wheat. A massive population explosion in Europe brought wheat prices up. By 1770, a bushel of wheat cost twice as much as it did in 1720. Farmers also expanded their production of [[flax seed]] and corn since flax was a high demand in the Irish [[linen]] industry and a demand for corn existed in the West Indies. Thus, by mid-century, most colonial farming was a commercial venture, although subsistence agriculture continued to exist in New England and the middle colonies.

Some immigrants who just arrived purchased farms and shared in this export wealth, but many poor German and Irish immigrants were forced to work as agricultural wage laborers. Merchants and artisans also hired these homeless workers for a domestic system for the manufacture of [[cloth]] and other goods. Merchants often bought [[wool]] and flax from farmers and employed newly arrived immigrants, who had been [[textile]] workers in Ireland and Germany, to work in their homes spinning the materials into yarn and cloth. Large farmers and merchants became wealthy, while farmers with smaller farms and artisans only made enough for subsistence. The Mid-Atlantic region, by 1750, was divided by both ethnic background and wealth.

==== Seaports ====

{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
Seaports that expanded from wheat trade had more social classes than anywhere else in the Middle Colonies. By 1773, the population of Philadelphia had reached 40,000, New York 25,000, and [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] 6,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/ecp/26/040/html/0100.html ''An Illustrated History of Baltimore''], Suzanne Ellery Greene, Woodland Hills, California: Windsor Publications, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants dominated seaport society, and about 40 merchants controlled half of Philadelphia's trade. Wealthy merchants in Philadelphia and New York, like their counterparts in New England, built elegant [[Georgian architecture|Georgian-style]] mansions such as those in [[List of houses in Fairmount Park|Fairmount Park]].

Shopkeepers, artisans, shipwrights, [[butcher]]s, [[cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[seamstress]]es, [[Shoemaking|cobblers]], [[baker]]s, [[carpenter]]s, [[masonry|masons]], and many other specialized professions made up the middle class of seaport society. Wives and husbands often worked as a team and taught their children their crafts to pass it on through the family. Many of these artisans and traders made enough money to create a modest life.

Laborers stood at the bottom of seaport society. These poor people worked on the docks unloading inbound vessels and loading outbound vessels with wheat, corn, and flax seed. Many of these were [[African American]]; some were free, while others were enslaved. In 1750, blacks made up about 10 percent of the population of New York and Philadelphia. Hundreds of seamen worked as sailors on merchant ships, some of whom were African American.

=== Southern colonies ===
The Southern colonies were mainly dominated by the wealthy planters in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina. They owned increasingly large plantations that were worked by African slaves. Of the 650,000 inhabitants of the South in 1750, about 250,000 or 40 percent, were slaves. The plantations grew tobacco, indigo and rice for export, and raised most of their own food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Twyman and David C. Roller, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Southern History'' (1979). {{ISBN|0-8071-0575-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many small subsistence farms were family owned and operated by [[Plain Folk of the Old South|yeoman]]. Most white men owned some land, and therefore could vote.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Brown and B. Katherine Brown, ''Virginia, 1705–1786: Democracy or Aristocracy?'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in the South ====
Historians have paid special attention to the role of women, family, and gender in the colonial South since the [[social history]] revolution in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Kierner, "Gender, Families, and Households in the Southern Colonies," ''Journal of Southern History'', Aug 2007, Vol. 73 Issue 3, pp 643–658&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Virginia, see Kathleen M. Brown, ''Good Wives, Nasty Wenches, and Anxious Patriarchs: Gender, Race, and Power in Colonial Virginia'' (1996) 512pp [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0807846236/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Marsh, ''Georgia's Frontier Women: Female Fortunes in a Southern Colony'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few women were present in the early [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] colonies. In 1650, estimates put Maryland's total population near six hundred, with fewer than two hundred women present.&lt;ref name="lois77"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr |first1=Lois Green |last2=Walsh |first2=Lorena S. |title=The Planter's Wife: The Experience of White Women in Seventeenth-Century Maryland|journal=[[The William and Mary Quarterly]]|date=Oct 1977|volume=34|issue=4|pages=542–571|doi=10.2307/2936182 |jstor=2936182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the population consisted of young, single, white indentured servants and, as such, the colonies lacked [[group cohesiveness|social cohesiveness]], to a large degree. African women entered the colony as early as 1619, although their status remains a historical debate—free, slave, or indentured servant.

In the 17th century, high mortality rates for newcomers and a very high ratio of men to women made family life either impossible or unstable for most colonists. These factors made families and communities fundamentally different from their counterparts in Europe and New England in the Virginia-Maryland region before 1700, along with dispersed settlements and a reluctance to live in villages, together with a growing immigration of white indentured servants and black slaves. These extreme conditions both demeaned and empowered women.

Women were often vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, especially teenage girls who were indentured servants and lacking male protectors. On the other hand, young women had much more freedom in choosing spouses, without parental oversight, and the shortage of eligible women enabled them to use marriage as an avenue to upward mobility. The high death rates meant that Chesapeake wives generally became widows who inherited property; many widows increased their property by remarrying as soon as possible. The population began to stabilize around 1700, with a 1704 census listing 30,437 white people present with 7,163 of those being women.&lt;ref name="lois77" /&gt; Women married younger, remained wed longer, bore more children, and lost influence within the family polity.&lt;ref name="lois77" /&gt;

[[File:Cavalieredicasata.JPG|thumb|250px|A knight with an eagle crest at the [[Saracen Joust]] in [[Arezzo]], Tuscany.]]

A '''crest''' is a component of a [[heraldry|heraldic]] display, consisting of the device borne on top of the [[helmet|helm]]. Originating in the decorative sculptures worn by knights in [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and, to a lesser extent, battles, crests became solely pictorial after the 16th century (the era referred to by heraldists as that of "paper heraldry").

A normal heraldic [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] consists of the shield, above which is set the helm, on which sits the crest, its base encircled by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a [[torse]]. The use of the crest and torse independently from the rest of the achievement, a practice which became common in the era of paper heraldry, has led the term "crest" to be frequently but erroneously used to refer to the [[coat of arms|arms]] displayed on the shield, or to the achievement as a whole.

==Origin==
[[File:Lutrelll.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Geoffrey Luttrell (1276-1345)|Sir Geoffrey Luttrell]], with fan crests displaying his arms on both his helmet and his horse's head. From the [[Luttrell Psalter]], c. 1330.]]
The word "crest" derives from the Latin ''crista'', meaning "tuft" or "plume", perhaps related to ''crinis'', "hair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crest|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=crest&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|last=Harper|first=Douglas|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crests had existed in various forms since ancient times: Roman officers wore fans of feathers or horsehair, which were placed longitudinally or transversely depending on the wearer's rank,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legionary Helmets of the Roman Period|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/articles/article-006.html|last=Dickson|first=Iain|publisher=Illustrated History of the Roman Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Viking helmets were often adorned with wings and animal heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barron|1911|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; They first appeared in a heraldic context in the form of the metal fans worn by knights in the 12th and 13th centuries. These were primarily decorative, but may also have served a practical purpose by lessening or deflecting the blows of opponents' weapons (perhaps why their edges came to be serrated).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox-Davies|1909|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fans were generally of one colour, later evolving to repeat all or part of the arms displayed on the shield.

The fan crest was later developed by cutting out the figure displayed on it, to form a metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott-Giles|1954|pp=150–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were usually made of cloth, leather or paper over a wooden or wire framework,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eve|1907|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were typically in the form of an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer's head down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eve|1907|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laces, straps, or rivets were used to affix the crest to the helm,&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies 1909 336"&gt;{{harvnb|Fox-Davies|1909|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet in the case of high-ranking nobles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott-Giles|1954|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barron|1911|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the [[mantling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox-Davies|1909|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a [[chapeau]], as in the royal crest of England.

==Later development==
By the 16th century the age of tournaments had ended, and physical crests largely disappeared. Their illustrated equivalents consequently began to be treated as simply two-dimensional pictures. Many crests from this period are physically impossible to bear on a helm, e.g. the crest granted to [[Sir Francis Drake]] in 1581, which consisted of a disembodied hand issuing from clouds and leading a ship around the globe (representing God's guidance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arms of Sir Francis Drake|url=http://www.wyverngules.com/Documents/ArmsofSFD/arms_of_sir_francis_drake.htm|last=Drake|first=Charles|publisher=A Genealogical and Heraldic Memorial of the Ancient Gentle Family of Drake of Drakenage|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519122719/http://www.wyverngules.com/Documents/ArmsofSFD/arms_of_sir_francis_drake.htm|archivedate=2012-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same period, different helms began to be used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (''affronté''), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (''dexter''). In the medieval period crests would always have faced the same way as the helm, but as a result of these rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion ''statant'', would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of the helm, rather than towards the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox-Davies|1909|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.

Heraldry in general underwent something of a renaissance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and many of the illogicalities of previous centuries were discarded. Crests are now generally not granted unless they could actually be used on a physical helm,&lt;ref name=Giles&gt;{{harvnb|Scott-Giles|1954|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rules about directions of helms are no longer rigidly observed.

==Usage==
[[File:Wappen Brandenburg Ansbach Kulmbach Bayreuth.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Arms of the [[Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], with fifteen crested helms.]]
The use of crests was once restricted to those of 'tournament rank', i.e. knights and above,&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies 1909 336"/&gt; but in modern times nearly all personal arms include crests.&lt;ref name=Giles/&gt; They are not generally used by women (with the exception of reigning queens) and clergymen, as they did not participate in war or tournaments and thus would not have helms on which to wear them. Some heraldists are also of the opinion that crests, as personal devices, are not suited for use by corporate bodies, but this is not widely observed.&lt;ref name=Giles/&gt;

In continental Europe, particularly Germany, crests have a far greater significance than in Britain, and it is common for one person to display multiple crests with his arms; certain high-ranking noblemen are entitled to as many as seventeen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox-Davies|1909|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice did not exist in Britain until the modern era, and arms with more than one crest are still rare. In contrast to Continental practice, where a crest is never detached from its helm, a Briton with more than one crest may choose to display only one crested helm, and have the other crests simply floating in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox-Davies|1909|pp=322–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though usually adopted through marriage to an heiress, examples exist of secondary crests being granted as [[augmentation of honour|augmentations]]: after defeating the Americans at the [[Battle of Bladensburg]], [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]] was granted, in addition to his original crest, the crest of an arm holding the US flag with a broken flagstaff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle of Bladensburg|url=http://www.themanwhocapturedwashington.com/bob.html|publisher=The Man Who Captured Washington: Major General Robert Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Douglas crest.png|thumb|150px|left|Crest-badge of a member of the house of Douglas.]]
After the 16th century, it became common for armigers to detach the crest and wreath from the helm, and use them in the manner of a [[heraldic badge|badge]], displayed on crockery, carriage doors, stationery, etc. This led to the erroneous use of the term "crest" to mean "arms", which has become widespread in recent years. Unlike a badge, which can be used by any amount of relatives and retainers, a crest is personal to the armiger, and its use by others is considered usurpation. In Scotland, however, a member of a clan or house is entitled to use a "[[Scottish crest badge|crest-badge]]", which consists of the chief's crest encircled by a strap and buckle inscribed with the chiefly motto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crests|url=http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/242.html|publisher=Court of the Lord Lyon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marks of [[cadency]] are generally not used with crests, though it is not incorrect to do so, and the British royal family continue this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott-Giles|1954|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, widely observed in England that no two families may use the same crest. This is in contrast to Scottish practice, in which crests are less significant, and are often borne in the same form by a great many unrelated people. As a result of this lack of need for differentiation, Scottish crests tend to be less ornamental than their English counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox-Davies|1909|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual torse around the crest is frequently replaced by some kind of coronet, known as a "crest-coronet". The standard form is a simplified ducal coronet, consisting of three fleurons on a golden circlet; these are not, however, indications of rank, though they are not generally granted nowadays except in special circumstances.&lt;ref name="Giles 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Scott-Giles|1954|pp=154–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some modern examples, the crest features both a crest-coronet and a torse,&lt;ref name="Giles 2"/&gt; though this practice is deprecated by purists.

==Orders of chivalry==
[[File:Edinburgh - Thistle Chapel in St Giles' Chapel 02.JPG|thumb|Stalls in the Thistle Chapel. From left to right: the stall of [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope of Craighead]]; [[Lady Marion Fraser]]; [[Eric Anderson (educator)|Sir Eric Anderson]]; the [[Andrew Bruce, 11th Earl of Elgin|Earl of Elgin]]; and [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|Lord Mackay of Clashfern]].]]
Perhaps the only places physical crests are still seen are the chapels of Britain's orders of chivalry: the [[Order of the Garter]]'s [[St George's Chapel]], the [[Order of the Thistle]]'s [[Thistle Chapel]], and the [[Order of the Bath]]'s [[Henry VII Chapel]]. Within each chapel are rows of stalls for use by the knights; above these stalls are placed each knight's sword and crested helm. These are carved out of lime wood and painted and gilded by [[Ian Brennan (sculptor)|Ian Brennan]], the official sculptor to the royal household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating a crest/arms|url=http://www.contemporarysculptor.com/family_coats_of_arms.htm|last=Brennan|first=Ian|publisher=Contemporary Sculptor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural property''' are physical items that are part of the [[cultural heritage]] of a group or society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; They include such items as historic buildings, works of art, archaeological sites, libraries and museums.

==Definition==
Article 1 of the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] of 1954 defines cultural property as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention 1954] at the UNESCO website&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The term 'cultural property' shall cover, irrespective of origin or ownership:
:(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people, such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the property defined above;
:(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a); 
:(c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), to be known as 'centers containing monuments'."

==Emblem==
[[File:Denkmal.png|thumb|upright=0.4|The cultural property emblem]]
Article 16 of the Convention describes the internationally recognized mark for cultural property as follows:
:(1) The distinctive emblem of the Convention shall take the form of a shield, pointed below, persaltire blue and white (a shield consisting of a royal-blue square, one of the angles of which forms the point of the shield, and of a royal-blue triangle above the square, the space on either side being taken up by a white triangle).

He was also a former president of New York's [[Gay Activists Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Hubert | last = Kennedy | title = Sexual Hysteria—Then and Now | year = 1991 | publisher = Gay and Lesbian Historical Society of Northern California | work = OurStories | pages = 17–18 | quote = A former president of New York's Gay Activists Alliance and a founding member of the North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), Thorstad is uniquely qualified to write on this topic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorstad describes himself as a [[bisexual]] pederast and atheist (a "recovered" [[Pentecostal]]) who has "never been charged with violating any sex laws".&lt;ref name="Matt C. Abbott"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matt C.

== Early activism ==
He was also active in [[Trotskyist]] politics for some years. For more than six years, Thorstad was a member of the Upper West Side branch of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), and a staff writer for its newspaper, ''The Militant''. He left the SWP in December 1973, citing the organization's lack of enthusiasm for the [[gay liberation]] movement and failure to develop a "Marxist materialist analysis" of it. In 1976 he self-published a collection of internal party documents relating to its discussion of the gay liberation movement, under the title ''Gay Liberation and Socialism: Documents from the Discussions on Gay Liberation Inside the Socialist Workers Party (1970-1973)''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gay Liberation and Socialism: Documents from the Discussions on Gay Liberation Inside the Socialist Workers Party (1970-1973)'' p.1, 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s Thorstad was president of the Gay Activists Alliance, a leading gay liberation group in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Historical Note | work =Gay Activists Alliance Records, 1970-1983 | publisher = New York Public Library Digital Library Collections | url =http://digilib.nypl.org/dynaweb/ead/human/mssgaa/@Generic__BookTextView/202;pt=197;nh=1?DwebQuery=Thorstad#X | accessdate = October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  June 1973 Thorstad and John Lauritsen published ''The Early Homosexual Rights Movement (1864-1935)'', a fourteen-page historical survey in the SWP internal ''Discussion Bulletin'' which attempted to prove that the gay liberation movement had a long and substantial history, particularly in Germany.&lt;ref name="LauritsenThorstad1973"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Lauritsen|author2=David Thorstad|title=The Homosexual Rights Movement (1864-1935)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkyGGwAACAAJ|year=1973|publisher=J.

== NAMBLA and pro-pedophile activism ==
In 1978 Thorstad was a founding member of NAMBLA, "served as a member of the Steering Committee from some undetermined time until September 1996" and was one of a group of NAMBLA members who were sued in 2000 for the wrongful death of a ten-year-old boy in a long-running court case ''[[Curley v. NAMBLA]]'' in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants =Barbara Curley, et al., Plaintiffs v. North American Man Boy Love Association, et. al., Defendants |reporter =O'Toole, D.J. |opinion =Memorandum and Order on Motions to Dismiss |pinpoint =Civil Action No. 00-10956-GAO |court =United States District Court of Massachusetts |date =March 31, 2003 |url= http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/opinions/otoole/pdf/curley%20mem%20ord%20mot%20to%20dism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorstad claims that pederasty is the main way in which homosexuality has been expressed in modern culture,&lt;ref name="Mind of a Pederast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pederasty and Homosexuality" /&gt; and that "[[child abuse]] hysteria is an industry of insanity aimed at homosexuals [which] ... plays on the impression people have always had of homosexuals as being [[child molesters]]", and describes opposition to NAMBLA as "... [similar] to one waged by '[[lesbian feminists]] who jumped right on the bandwagon' of what he calls the anti-gay male/child pornography scare", according to ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''.&lt;ref name="Publishing1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Here Publishing|title=The Advocate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|date=23 August 1994|publisher=Here Publishing|page=37|issn=0001-8996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also likened being a pederast in the [[United States]] as the equivalent of being "a Jew in [[Nazi Germany]]" and has criticized the mainstream [[LGBT community]] for its [[assimilationist]] approach towards [[capitalist]] and [[heterocentric]] society.&lt;ref name="Pederasty and Homosexuality"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6A1tpiOsT Pederasty and Homosexuality] by David Thorstad (archived at [[WebCite]])&lt;/ref&gt; He has also said that the label ''[[LGBT]]'' is "the most absurd one of all" and is "far too fixed an identity, eliding the fluidity of sexuality and sexual behavior ...  in that sense&lt;nowiki&gt;[,]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Kinsey's scale]] is valid."&lt;ref name="Mind of a Pederast"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matt C. Abbott|title=The mind of a pederast|url=http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/abbott/100822|publisher=[[RenewAmerica]]|accessdate=September 1, 2015|date=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believes that "assimilationist homosexual groups[,] ... the psychiatric profession and the bourgeois media, such as the ''New York Times'' ... all nowadays blur distinctions by lumping everything under the rubric 'pedophilia,' an absurdity apparently intended to criminalize love and force very different behaviors into one negative pigeonhole."&lt;ref name="Mind of a Pederast" /&gt;

Summaries of Thorstad's views appear in his articles "Man/Boy Love and the American Gay Movement" in ''Male Intergenerational Intimacy: Historical, Socio-Psychological and Legal Perspectives'',&lt;ref&gt;Theo Sandfort, Edward Brongersma, and Alex van Naerssen, editors, Routledge, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and "Homosexuality and the American Left: The Impact of Stonewall," in ''Gay Men and the Sexual History of the Political Left''.&lt;ref&gt;Gert Hekma, Harry Oosterhuis, and James Steakley, editors, Haworth Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edith Lagos''' was a revolutionary, member of the terrorist organisation known as the [[Shining Path]] (Sendero Luminoso).

Born into a wealthy  family, she studied law at a San Martin de Porres University, before dropping out to join Shining Path&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GTN0481FXRYC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=Edith%20Lagos|title=Women as Terrorists: Mothers, Recruiters, and Martyrs|last=Cragin|first=Kim|last2=Daly|first2=Sara A.|date=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780275989095|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://altavoz.pe/2017/04/20/23464/quien-es-edith-lagos-la-senderista-del-video-del-frente-amplio|title=¿Quién es Edith Lagos, la senderista del video del Frente Amplio?|website=altavoz.pe|language=es|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, she escaped prison after a Shining Path detachment blew a hole in the [[Ayacucho]] jail which freed all of the prisoners, including captured fellow militants, suspects of armed activity and common law criminals.

Two years later after promoting and participating in resistance activities with Shining Path, Edith Lagos died in a shootout incident involving the Police and paramilitary forces in the town of Umaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=BeA4CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q=Edith%20Lagos|title=The Shining Path: A History of the Millenarian War in Peru|last=Gorriti|first=Gustavo|date=2000-11-09|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807866856|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was later buried in her town of birth, Ayacucho. It was estimated that up to 30,000 people attended the funeral. Her tomb was later bombed by the [[Rodrigo Franco Command]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.andes.missouri.edu/andes/Especiales/VG_CuerpoMuerto.html|title=Ciberayllu: Guerrero - El cuerpo muerto y el fetiche en Sendero Luminoso: el caso de Edith Lagos|last=(DM)|first=Victoria Guerrero|website=www.andes.missouri.edu|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a false flag paramilitary group.

This article is concerned with the '''events that preceded World War II in Asia'''.

== Kuomintang and Communism in China ==

{{off topic|date=February 2011}}
The revolution led by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party) and others ended the last Chinese dynasty, the [[Qing Dynasty]], which was replaced by a [[republic]], the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], in 1912. Prior to [[World War I]], however, the ROC central government failed to effectively rule its territory. China fell into a fragmented region of local [[warlord]]s.  Other than the warlord-controlled central government, two primary forces aimed to unite China under their [[ideology]]. The KMT was reorganized in 1919, and the [[Communist Party of China]] was formed in 1921. The two parties were not immediate enemies and had short-term partnership. In 1924, KMT started a military campaign to defeat the northern warlords. In 1927, with much of southern and central China under the KMT control, the KMT openly turned on the CPC. The KMT took most parts of China under its power in 1928, and the warlord controlling [[Manchuria]] agreed to KMT leadership of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]].

== Noteworthy events ==

The following events played a significant role in setting the stage for the involvement of Asia and the Pacific in World War II:
* 1839:  [[First Opium War]] in China against the west, forcing China to import British opium. Britain won the war and as a result gained control over Hong Kong.
* 1853:  American Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] arrives in Tokyo harbor and forces Japanese to allow trade with American merchants with threat of military action.
* 1856:  Outbreak of the [[Second Opium War]] or the Arrow War in China. Resulting [[Treaties of Tianjin]] at 1858, [[Treaty of Aigun]], etc., [[Unequal Treaties]] and also burning, looting of the [[Old Summer Palace]] and [[New Summer Palace]]. "Beyond any doubt, by 1860 the ancient civilization that was China had been thoroughly defeated and humiliated by the West."
* 1858:  Western nations force Japan to sign the [[Unequal Treaties]]. These articles established export and import tariffs and the concept of "extraterritoriality" (i.e. Japan held no jurisdiction over foreign criminals in its land. Their trials were to be conducted by foreign judges under their own nation's laws). Japan had no power to change these terms.
* 1868:  Japan, in an effort to modernize and prevent future Western dominance, ousts the Tokugawa Shogunate and adopts a new Meiji Emperor. The next few decades see arguably the most rapid and successful industrialization of any economy in world history during the [[Meiji Restoration]].
* 1894–1895: The [[First Sino-Japanese War]] ends in Japanese victory, results in Japanese dominance in Korea and Japanese control of Liaodong Peninsula (later returned to China for payment), Taiwan and Penghu Islands.  Balance of power in Asia permanently altered.
* 1899:  With newly gained power from recent industrialization, Japan successfully renegotiates aspects of the Unequal Treaties.
* 1899–1901: The [[Boxer Rebellion]] led China to a humiliating defeat by the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] of Western powers including the United States and Japan, ceding more territory, and dealing one of the final blows to the struggling Qing Dynasty.
* 1904–1905:  The '''[[Russo-Japanese War]]''' begins with a surprise attack and ends by an eventual Japanese victory over [[Imperial Russia]]. Japanese control over [[Korea]] until World War II is assured.
* 1910: Empire of Japan annexes Korea.

===Republic of China era===
* 1911: The [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] overthrows the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]] and establishes the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. Warlord factions, however, continue to fight for personal gains, resulting in near-constant warfare as the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalists]] struggle to gain international recognition and support while bringing peace to volatile regions of [[China]].
* 1914:  During [[World War I]] Japan and other Allies seize [[Germany|German]] colonial possessions.
* 1919:  The [[May Fourth Movement]] erupts in [[Beijing]] to protest to the Chinese government’s weak response to the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Japan, as a member of the victorious Allies during World War I, gains a [[League of Nations Mandate|mandate]] over various Pacific islands previously part of the German colonial empire.  The primary island chains are the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Marianas]], the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], and [[Truk Lagoon]].  Japan joins the [[League of Nations]].
* 1921:  Foundation of the [[Communist Party of China]].
* 1922:  The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] is signed, limiting the fleets and vessels of the navies of the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Italy.  Japan is limited to about two-thirds of the fleet allowed for the United States and Britain.  This is seen in Japan as a denial of Japanese equality amongst European powers.
* 1924: [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]]  dies in Moscow. After internal political intrigues, primarily against [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Joseph Stalin]] takes power a year later. The first congress of the [[Kuomintang]] under [[Sun Yat-Sen]] is held.
* 1925: [[Dr. Sun Yat-sen]] dies in Beijing. After internal political intrigues, primarily against [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]] takes over the leadership of the KMT
* 1927:  Open conflict between the CCP and KMT commences. 
* 1929: The [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)|Sino-Soviet conflict]] over the Manchurian [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] demonstrated the military weakness of the Republic of China (KMT). Later the Soviet Union sell its stocks to the Manchukuo government.
* 1930:  The [[London Naval Treaty]] is signed, putting a halt to [[battleship]] production until 1937.  Limitations on [[submarine]]s and other [[surface combatant]]s are also made.

==World War II in Asia==
Many Historians believe that the Second World War began with the [[Mukden Incident]] in Manchuria on September 18, 1931. Japanese Occupation of Much of Asia would expand over the next ten years and last until 1945.  
===1931–37: Japan Vs. China===
*September 18, 1931: The [[Mukden Incident]], known as the "9.18 Incident": Japanese agents blow up part of the Japanese owned [[South Manchurian Railroad]] at [[Mukden]] in northeastern China, and label it sabotage by Chinese forces. Using the incident as a pretext, the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] is launched. Within six months the occupation of [[Manchuria]] is complete. 
* January 28, 1932: The [[January 28 Incident]]: fighting erupts between Chinese boycotters and Japanese troops protecting the Japanese section of Shanghai. The Japanese dispatch a naval invasion force in an attempt to capture Shanghai. However, the invasion ended in a stalemate. United Kingdom and United States broker a cease-fire between China and Japan three months after the hostilities begin.
* February, 1932: [[Manchukuo]] is announced as an independent nation, in reality a Japanese puppet government for [[Manchuria]]. It encompassed the three northeastern Chinese provinces occupied by Japan since the "9.18 Incident." Japanese control remains direct however, and Japanese owned interests gain considerable power. Additionally, the opium trade is encouraged. Manchukuo was not recognized by the [[League of Nations]] and Japan subsequently withdraws from the organization.
* May, 1932 [[May 15 incident]]: Japanese Prime Minister [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]] assassinated by a group of young officers for his support of the London Naval Treaty, which is seen in Japan as preventing parity of forces. 
* January 1934, the Soviet Union invades the Republic of China in the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]].
* October, 1934 – November, 1935:  The Chinese Communists led by [[Mao Zedong]] conduct the [[Long March]], retreating  from [[Kiangsi]] to [[Yan'an]] in [[Shensi]]. 
* December 29, 1934:  Japan abrogates the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].
* December, 1935:  Large-scale anti-Japanese riots take place in [[Peking|Beiping]].
* February, 1936 [[February 26 Incident]]: Japanese junior officers coup attempt.
* November, 1936:  Japan joins Germany in signing the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], concluded to provide a two-front threat to the Soviet Union.  Japan is however not interested in being drawn into a European war, and thus the pact is not a true alliance.
* December 25, 1936:  [[Xi'an Incident]]: Arrest of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] by [[Zhang Xueliang]] leads to [[Second United Front]] alignment against Japan.
* July 7, 1937:  [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. Japanese forces conducting military exercises outside Peking claimed that several Japanese soldiers were not accounted for after the exercise.  Japanese launch an all-out assault. Nanking government declares its intent to resist Japan, marking the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. (Note: For political reasons, war was not declared by either side at this point. The Chinese declaration of war came on December 8, 1941).

===1937-39: The War expands===
* August–October, 1937: Soviet Union invades Republic of China in the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]]
* August–November, 1937:  Full scale fighting erupts throughout northern China, and Japan overcomes initial failures with landings and reinforcements in Shanghai. Before the [[Battle of Shanghai]], the Tokyo government announced that Japan would complete the conquest of Shanghai in three days, and all of China within three months. KMT troops held Shanghai for over three months.
[[Image:Chinese soldiers poorly armed.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Chinese soldiers poorly armed.]]
* December, 1937:  Nanking captured and subjected to months of rampage.  The [[Rape of Nanking]] resulted in the deaths of  up to 300,000 Chinese civilians. This is in line with the [[Three Alls Policy]]: kill all, burn all, loot all.
* April, 1938:  Chinese Nationalists gain a major victory over Japanese forces in [[Shantung]] province.
* June, 1938:  The Japanese advance along the [[Yellow River]] is halted by the breaking of dams by the Chinese.  The surprise flood kills many Japanese but also as many as 1,000,000 civilians.
* July, 1938:  Japanese forces provoke a battle with the Soviets at [[Lake Hassan]] in Manchukuo.  The Soviets handily defeat the Japanese.
* October, 1938:  The Japanese Central China Army captures Hankow, ending their advance up the [[Yangtze River]].  Landings near [[Hong Kong]] capture [[Guangzhou|Canton]], cutting off of the Chinese Nationalists from ocean ports.  
* November, 1938:  The [[New Order for East Asia]] is declared by Japan.  This declaration of Japanese plans for dominance of East Asia further deteriorates their relations with western nations.
* February, 1939:  Japan captures [[Hainan Island]], which is seen to have strategic implications by the British.
* May–September, 1939:  Japan and the Soviet Union engage in [[Soviet-Japanese Border War (1939)|border clashes]] around the [[Khalka River]] in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], culminating in the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]]. Crushing defeats lead the [[Nanshin-ron|Strike South Group]] to avoid conflict against the powerful Soviet Army, preferring to confront the United States instead.
* July, 1939:  The United States announces its withdrawal from its commercial treaty with Japan.

===The Conquest of Southeast Asia and the Road to Pearl Harbor===
* September 1940: [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|Japan invades French Indochina]].
* April, 1941: American volunteer pilots secretly recruited in U.S. Their first actual combat will be in December 1941 in Burma where they will begin to wreak havoc upon Japanese forces and will soon be named the [[Flying Tigers]].
* June 22, 1941: [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] invades the [[Soviet Union]] in what became known as [[Operation Barbarossa]].
* August, 1941: The United States, which at the time supplied 80% of Japanese oil imports, initiates a complete oil [[embargo]]. This threatens to cripple both the Japanese economy and military strength once the strategic reserves run dry, unless alternative oil-sources can be found.
* December 7, 1941: Japan [[Battle of Hong Kong|invades Hong Kong]], [[Battle of Guam (1941)|Guam]], [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Philippines Campaign (1941–1942)|The Philippines]] shortly after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbor]]. The [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|United States]], the Netherlands and the [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Japan|United Kingdom]] formally declare war on Japan the next day.

'''HIAG''' ({{lang-de|Hilfsgemeinschaft auf Gegenseitigkeit der Angehörigen der ehemaligen Waffen-SS}}, literally "Mutual aid association of former Waffen-SS members") was a [[Advocacy group|lobby group]] and a [[Denialism|denialist]] veterans' organisation founded by former high-ranking [[Waffen-SS]] personnel in [[West Germany]] in 1951. Its main objective was to achieve legal, economic and historical rehabilitation of the Waffen-SS.

To achieve these aims, the organisation used contacts with political parties, and employed multi-prong [[historical negationism]] and [[propaganda]] efforts, including periodicals, books and public speeches. A HIAG-owned publishing house, Munin Verlag, served as a platform for its publicity aims. This extensive body of work, 57 book titles and more than 50 years of monthly periodicals, has been described by historians as revisionist [[apologia]].

Always in touch with its members' [[Nazi]] past, HIAG was a subject of significant controversy, both in West Germany and abroad. The organisation drifted into open [[right-wing extremism]] in its later history; it disbanded in 1992 at the federal level, but local groups, along with the organisation's monthly periodical, continued to exist into the 21st century.

While HIAG only partially achieved its goals of legal and economic rehabilitation of the Waffen-SS, its propaganda efforts led to the reshaping of the image of the [[Waffen-SS in popular culture]]. The results are still felt, with scholarly treatments being outweighed by a large amount of amateur historical studies, memoirs, picture books, websites and wargames.

==Post-World War II context==

The [[Potsdam Conference]] held by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States from 17 July to 2 August 1945 determined the policies that [[Allied-occupied Germany]] was to face. These included [[demilitarisation]], [[denazification]], [[democratisation]] and [[decentralisation]]. The Allies' attempts were often perceived by the occupied population as "victors' justice" and met with limited success.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=79–80}} For those in the Western occupation zones, the beginning of the [[Cold War]] further undermined these policies by reviving the idea of the necessity to fight against Soviet communism, echoing one aspect of Hitler's foreign policy.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=80}}

Another important post-war development was the decision to rearm West Germany. In 1950, after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], it became clear to the United States that German armed forces would need to be reconstituted. Former German officers used the changing political and military situation as a leverage to demand a rehabilitation of the [[Wehrmacht]]. In October 1950, a group of former senior officers produced a document, which became known as the [[Himmerod memorandum]], for West German chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]]. It included the demands that German war criminals be released and that the "defamation" of the German soldiers, including the [[Waffen-SS]] personnel, cease, which Adenauer worked to implement.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=73–74}}

To accommodate the West German government, the Allies commuted a number of war crimes sentences.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=74}} Public declaration from Supreme Allied Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] followed in January 1951, which read in part:{{sfn|Wette|2007|pp=236–238}}{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=74–75}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have come to know that there is a real difference between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=75}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same year (1951), some former career officers of the Wehrmacht were granted war pensions. Unlike the Wehrmacht, the SS had been deemed a criminal organisation at the [[Nuremberg trials]] and could thus act as an "alibi of a nation" (as [[Gerald Reitlinger#Main publications|Gerald Reitlinger's 1956 book]] of that title suggested), solely responsible for crimes of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. Consequently, Waffen-SS career personnel were not covered under the 1951 law.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=136–137}}

Since 1949, the ban on forming veterans' associations had been lifted. Encouraged by the shifting tone of the World War II discourse and the courting of the Wehrmacht veterans by the West German government and political parties, former Waffen-SS members came forward to campaign for their rights.{{sfn|Diehl|1993|p=224}}

==Formation==
HIAG's history began in late 1950 by a gradual amalgamation of local groups. The majority of its members were former junior officers in the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=82}} In the summer of 1951, HIAG was formally established by [[Otto Kumm]], a former SS-[[Brigadeführer]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}} By October 1951, HIAG claimed to consist of 376 local branches.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=82}}

===Leadership===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-299, KZ-Mauthausen, Himmlervisite.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|alt=Photo of the 1941 SS tour of the Mauthausen concentration camp led by [[Heinrich Himmler]]; Otto Kumm (shown in  front row, left), Wilhelm Bittrich and Paul Hausser took part in the tour|The 1941 SS tour of the [[Mauthausen concentration camp]] headed by [[Heinrich Himmler]] (centre). Taking part were [[Otto Kumm]] (front row, left), [[Wilhelm Bittrich]], and [[Paul Hausser]], who became key figures in HIAG after the war.]]
By December 1951, former high-ranking Waffen-SS general [[Paul Hausser]] was HIAG's first spokesperson.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=82}} Two well-known former Waffen-SS commanders, [[Felix Steiner]] and [[Herbert Gille]], became early leading figures.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=93}} [[Sepp Dietrich]]{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2014|p=753}} and [[Kurt Meyer]]{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=254}} became active members upon their release from prison, in 1955 and 1954. Meyer became HIAG's most effective spokesman.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=93}} After his death in 1961, [[Erich Eberhardt]], formerly of [[3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf|SS Division ''Totenkopf'']], assumed that role.{{sfn|Cüppers|2005|p=336}} As of 1977, [[Wilhelm Bittrich]] served as the chairman;{{sfn|Chairoff|1977|p=460}} as of 1976 [[Hubert Meyer]] acted as the federal spokesperson.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=295}}

HIAG membership was open to convicted war criminals, with the group's position being to absolve them of their responsibility. For example, the group openly embraced and advocated on behalf of Dietrich, [[Walter Reder]], and [[Herbert Kappler]], the former SS men convicted of war-time massacres.{{sfn|Kühne|2017|pp=271–272}} 

===Organisational principles===

With the publication of its first periodical, ''Wiking-Ruf'' ("Viking Call"), in late 1951, HIAG was beginning to draw attention to itself and generate public controversy, including speculation that it was a [[neo-Nazi]] organisation. In response, Hausser wrote an open letter to the [[Bundestag]], West Germany's parliament, denying these accusations and describing the HIAG as an advocacy organisation for former Waffen-SS troops. Hausser asserted that its members rejected all forms of radicalism and were "upstanding citizens".{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=82–83}}

The HIAG bylaws of 1952 described the aims of the organisation as providing comradeship, legal assistance, support for those in Allied captivity, help for families and aid in searches for those still missing. The HIAG campaigned for Waffen-SS veterans to be awarded the legal status of "persons formerly in the public service" under article 131 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], so that they would qualify for the same rights and pensions as Wehrmacht's career soldiers.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=83}}

The historian David C. Large wrote that, like any public pronouncements, these bylaws did not tell the full story of HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, he was able to tease out what the organisation stood for.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=83–84}} For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, living and dead, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=83–84}}

The organisation also asserted that the Waffen-SS was merely "the fourth arm of the Wehrmacht"; these claims were even "more dubious", explains Large. As a Nazi organisation combining both military and police powers, the Waffen-SS was a combat arm of the [[SS]]: its members stood under SS jurisdiction separate from that of the Wehrmacht; personnel transitioned smoothly between the frontline formations, punitive detachments and SS concentration camp organisation; and the frontline units themselves were thoroughly implicated in war crimes during the campaigns in the West and in the East, and in the atrocities  against civilian population in the Soviet Union and Poland.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=85}}{{refn|group="n"|According to the ''Modern Genocide: The Definitive Resource and Document Collection'', the Waffen-SS had played a "paramount role" in the ideological war of extermination (''Vernichtungskrieg''), and not just as frontline or rear area security formations: a third of the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (mobile killing squads) members which were responsible for mass murder especially of Jews and communists, had been recruited from Waffen-SS personnel prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bartrop|Jacobs|2014|p=1424}}}}

On the other hand, as the war progressed, and the Waffen-SS grew to encompass conscripts (from 1943), Waffen-SS personnel began to resemble that of the Wehrmacht, contributing to the postwar confusion as to the organisation's status. It allowed the Waffen-SS proponents to advance the idea of Waffen-SS men being "soldiers like all other"—the phrase first put forth in HIAG's materials, and later publicly used by Chancellor Adenauer. Large argues that the equivalence is meaningless, as, contrary to the myth of a [[clean Wehrmacht]], it [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|actively participated]] in the racial war of extermination in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=86}}

===Ideology===
Although HIAG's leaders discouraged political affiliations, any leanings were to be "in the spirit of European and patriotic sentiment," as described in a 1951 issue of ''Wiking-Ruf'' ("Viking Call").{{sfn|Steiner|1975|p=277}} Internal disagreements began to emerge in the mid-1950s as to the stance of the organisation: Steiner, Gille and Meyer favoured a more political, outspoken orientation. The rest of the leadership favored a moderate approach in order not to jeopardise HIAG's goals of legal and economic rehabilitation, which, in their opinion, could only come from the establishment: the government and the Bundestag.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=86–87}}

==Waffen-SS advocacy==
The main stated aims of the organisation were to provide assistance to veterans and campaign for the rehabilitation of their legal status with respect to war pensions. During its early existence, HIAG also focused on "tracing service" actions (''Kameraden-Suchdienst'').{{sfn|Steiner|1975|p=277}}

===Tracing service meetings===
[[File:Der Freiwillige 1959 cover.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Graphic of the 1959 cover of ''Der Freiwillige''|1959 cover of ''Der Freiwillige'' with a reference to the HIAG meeting in Hamelin. The gathering is termed ''Suchdiensttreffen'' ("tracing service meeting"), but was in fact a large-scale convention with 15,000 members attending.{{sfn|Steiner|1975|p=277}}{{sfn|Ward|2015|p=see url}}]]
HIAG embraced the ''Suchdienst'' activities, not only because it was concerned for the fate of some 40,000 members of the Waffen-SS who were missing in action, but because this outwardly humanitarian and non-political activity could help improve its perception by the West German government and the society at large. Such public relations activities ("image polishing", according to Large) were important to HIAG as it faced ongoing scrutiny, and even calls for a ban on the organisation.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=90–91}} The ''Suchdiensttreffen'' events (literally: tracing service meetings) later evolved into annual ''Kameradschaftstreffen'' ("veterans' reunions"), which were large-scale conventions, often accompanied by rallies.{{sfn|Steiner|1975|p=277}}

===Inaugural convention===
In 1952, the organisation held its first major meeting in [[Verden an der Aller|Verden]]. It began respectably, with Gille announcing that the veterans were ready to "do their duty for the Fatherland" and Steiner declaring support for "freedom, order and justice". But the next speaker delivered a different message. [[Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke]], a former paratroop general and a convicted war criminal, invited to demonstrate so-called solidarity with the Wehrmacht, condemned the Western Allies as the "real war criminals" and insisted that the blacklist on which all former SS members then stood would soon become "a list of honour".{{sfn|Large|1987|p=91}}

The outburst caused a furor within West Germany. Periodicals as far as the U.S. and Canada carried headlines "Hitler's Guard Cheers Ex-chief" and "Rabble-Rousing General Is Worrying the Allies", with the latter article reporting that Ramcke's speech had been greeted with "roars of approval and cries of 'Eisenhower, ''Schweinehund''!' ('Pig – Dog')".{{sfn|Ottawa Citizen|1952}}{{sfn|Sarasota Herald-Tribune|1952}} HIAG and its spokesperson Steiner hastily tried to distance the organisation from Ramcke and his remarks.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=91}} Subsequent conventions, which were in effect used for political purposes, added to the controversy surrounding the organisation.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=92–93}} (See also "Controversies" section below.)

===Waffen-SS war criminals as victims===
The notion that Waffen-SS personnel had been "soldiers like all others" found its way into the discourse of war captivity. HIAG claimed that its members were victims of victor's justice and complained of harsh internment conditions. HIAG equated the status of prisoners of war with that of war criminals, obfuscating the differences between the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}}

Along with other veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the immediate amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation in the area of rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the amnesty issue. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in [[Werl Prison]] when he went there on an inspection tour.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=88}}

In its periodical ''Wiking-Ruf'', HIAG made use of the same drawings of emaciated German POWs behind barbed wire used by the publications of another post-war organisation—the West German {{illm|Association of Returnees and Families of POWs and MIAs|de|Verband der Heimkehrer, Kriegsgefangenen und Vermisstenangehörigen Deutschlands}} (VdH).{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}} War captivity was depicted as the last stage of the so-called ordinary military career in the Waffen-SS in books and publications of the HIAG.{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=247}} In its turn, VdH saw its role as a peace-seeking counterbalance to militaristic veterans' organisations such as HIAG and explicitly distanced itself from them in the early 1950s.{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=299}}

===Relationship with political parties===
Behind the scenes, HIAG cultivated close relationships with the ruling [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) and the main opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), garnering attention by inflating its membership numbers and influence. In meetings with politicians in the early 1950s, HIAG claimed to represent 2 million potential voters, a vast exaggeration as only 250,000 Waffen-SS veterans were living in West Germany at that time.{{sfn|Der Spiegel|2011}}

HIAG was successful in stoking politicians' fears that millions of disaffected former soldiers would be a threat to the nascent West German democracy. That is perhaps why SPD leader [[Kurt Schumacher]], who himself had been persecuted by the Nazis, decided to establish contact with HIAG. When he first met with its leaders in 1951, Schumacher believed that 150,000 people were already members of HIAG, as evidenced by internal party correspondence; he considered that number to be "politically significant".{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=97–98}} In the same letter, Schumacher referred to the Waffen-SS as a "branch of the Wehrmacht".{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=97–98}}

Later, the SPD defence policy expert [[Fritz Erler (politician)|Fritz Erler]] and [[Helmut Schmidt]], a member of SPD parliamentary delegation and a future [[Chancellor of West Germany]], handled the relationship with HIAG. They maintained close contact, attending private and public meetings and keeping regular correspondence. They often admonished HIAG leadership for the membership's "undemocratic" ways, but these efforts at reforming the veterans were futile. Such dealing with HIAG caused concerns within SPD, as shown by internal party correspondence, where HIAG's members were thus described as "unteachables" (''Unbelehrbare'').{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=99–101}}{{sfn|Der Spiegel|2011}}

HIAG found its best champion in the centre-right [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), whose platform was most closely aligned to its goals. The FDP voted against the de-nazification process in 1950; demanded the release of all "so-called war criminals" in 1951 (as the war criminals were largely termed in West Germany at that time); and welcomed the establishment of veterans' organisations of former Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS members. However, as only a coalition partner to the larger CDU and SPD, it could not deliver on what HIAG wanted; hence, the main thrust of HIAG's lobbying was directed at CDU and SPD, especially during election years.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=97–101}}

===Controversies===
HIAG took on the cause of those imprisoned or executed for war crimes and openly celebrated its members' Nazi past. Below is a partial list of ensuing controversies in the first 12 years of HIAG's existence:
* In 1953, HIAG conventioneers staged a torchlit procession for a "[[Christmas in Nazi Germany|solstice celebration]]" (the manner in which Christmas was celebrated in Nazi Germany). They  marched up to [[Palace Staufeneck|Staufeneck Castle]] in Bavaria, chanting Nazi songs, including ''This Is the Guard that Adolf Hitler Loves''.{{sfn|Der Spiegel|2011}}
* In 1954, plans for a HIAG convention in [[Göttingen]] faced strong opposition from the local Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Jewish Council, the Students' Association and the University hierarchy. Federal government officials intervened, and the event was first postponed and then scaled down to a much smaller meeting lacking the qualities of a political event.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=92}}
* Following the reburial of executed war criminals in [[Hamelin]] in 1954, the cemetery became the focal point for veterans' reunions, with distinct Nazi overtones. In 1959, the HIAG convention in Hamelin attracted a crowd of 15,000 and concluded with "comrades gathering around the tomb" of [[Bernhard Siebken]], a convicted war criminal executed in 1949.{{sfn|Ward|2015|p=see url}} &lt;!---The photo of the commemorative ceremony appeared in ''Der Freiwillige''.--&gt;
* Also in 1959, the Interior Minister of [[Hesse]] prohibited the holding of a HIAG ''Suchdiensttreffen'' citing the German Red Cross' decision not to lend its support due to these meetings being "superfluous".{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=92–93}}
* In 1961, HIAG attempted to place a glorifying obituary of [[Max Simon]], a former ''[[Gruppenführer]]'' in the SS, in the German newspaper ''Frankfurter Allgemeine''. Simon had been convicted by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] courts as a war criminal and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the [[Marzabotto massacre]], but was pardoned in 1954. He was subsequently tried twice in the Federal courts for the [[Max Simon#Killings in Brettheim|killings in Brettheim]] and other crimes, but, "to the horror of the West German public," as ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'' wrote in 2010, was found not guilty.{{sfn|Frankfurter Allgemeine|2010}} To HIAG's indignation, ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'' refused to run the obituary.{{sfn|Frankfurter Allgemeine|2010}}
* In 1963, a HIAG convention planned for the city of Hamelin had to be cancelled at short notice due to public pressure.{{sfn|Ward|2015|p=see url}}

Large, who studied HIAG extensively, stated in 1987 that HIAG's anti-democratic and anti-Semitic statements were "the essence of what HIAG was all about," concluding that the HIAG's leaders remained true to their [[Nazi ideology]].{{sfn|Large|1987|p=101}}{{refn|group="n"|Large: They "never cast off the political philosophy in which they had been reared and trained"{{sfn|Large|1987|p=101}}}} Similarly, the historian Karsten Wilke, who worked with the HIAG archives in the 2000s, discovered that the HIAG members' positions were "consistently racist, anti-Semitic and anti-democratic," as the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described in its 2011 article "The Brown Bluff: How Waffen SS Veterans Exploited Postwar Politics". Referencing Wilke's work, ''Der Spiegel'' quoted a HIAG member's letter to the leadership conveying the dismay at "Jews" who became "powerful once again" and could thus stand in the way of political support for the Waffen-SS rehabilitation. ''Spiegel'' also reported Wilke's findings that the HIAG leadership maintained close contacts with far-right groups.{{sfn|Der Spiegel|2011}}

===Effectiveness===
Lobbying by HIAG and other revisionists produced some early successes. In 1953, Chancellor Adenauer announced in a public speech in Hannover that members of the combat formations of the Waffen-SS had been "soldiers just like the rest" who had been "simply drafted".{{sfn|Large|1987|p=90}} Large describes this declaration as "irresponsible and unhistorical,"{{sfn|Large|1987|p=90}} while the military historian [[Simon MacKenzie|S.P. MacKenzie]] refers to it, when used in reference to the Western Front, as "the least credible" of the several claims put forth by Waffen-SS apologists.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=141}} He points out that, in the East, the Wehrmacht equaled the Waffen-SS in its brutality, so the attempted equivalence was "rather ironic".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=141}}

In the following months, a number of war criminals from the ranks of the Waffen-SS were released. Many of them were made eligible for prisoner-of-war compensation from local governments. In 1956 the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]] announced that former members of the Waffen-SS, up to the grade of lieutenant colonel, would be accepted to the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' at their old rank.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=254}}

Former Waffen-SS men who wished to join the ''Bundeswehr'' still faced heightened scrutiny. All Waffen-SS applicants went through the rigorous vetting process reserved for those with the higher ranks in the Wehrmacht. HIAG protested to the government and its military planners, but to no avail. As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=136–137}}

At its height in the early 1960s around 8% of the approximately 250,000 former Waffen-SS members living in [[West Germany]] were members of HIAG.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|p=78}} This was the timeframe when HIAG achieved its last success in economic rehabilitation: in 1961, the West German government partially restored pension rights to Waffen-SS personnel under the 131 legislation. Included were those former Waffen-SS members who had served for a minimum of 10 years strictly in a military capacity, thus amounting to a tiny number of eligible personnel. HIAG greeted this development as a partial victory, which they hoped would lead to a complete rehabilitation.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=102}}

But this wider aim proved impossible to achieve: the government was circumspect as rehabilitating the Waffen-SS would have opened the door to claims by personnel of other SS and Nazi organisations, including [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], [[Hitler Youth]], and others—a prospect the federal government would rather not have had raised either domestically or internationally.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=90}} The public image of the organisation was not helping either, because some of the more outspoken HIAG members sounded "alarmingly Nazi in their pronouncements," according to MacKenzie.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}}

==Waffen-SS historical revisionism==
During the Nuremberg Trials, Waffen-SS personnel, such as Hausser in his testimony as a defence witness, contended that it was a purely military organisation no different from the Wehrmacht. The prosecution at Nuremberg rejected this claim and successfully argued that the Waffen-SS was an integral part of the SS apparatus. The Tribunal found that "the units of the Waffen-SS were directly involved in the killings of the prisoners of war and the atrocities in the occupied countries" and judged the entire SS to be a criminal organisation.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=250–251}}

HIAG aimed to reverse that judgement through significant [[Propaganda|propaganda efforts]] in the service of its [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]].{{sfn|Large|1987|p=81}}{{refn|group="n"|According to Large, HIAG attempted "to manipulate historical record or simply to ignore it".{{sfn|Large|1987|p=81}}}} HIAG's rewriting of history encompassed multi-prong publicity campaigns, including tendentious periodicals, books and public speeches, as well as a publishing house dedicated to presenting the Waffen-SS in a positive light. The leadership viewed restoring the "tarnished shield"{{refn|group="n"|See the chapter "Tarnished Shield: Waffen-SS Criminality" in ''The Waffen SS: Hitler's Elite Guard at War, 1939–1945'' (1966) by George H. Stein}} as a key component of the desired legal and economic rehabilitation, and thus no effort was spared.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=138}}{{sfn|Wilke|2011|p=399}}

===Periodicals and illustrated books===
HIAG's first periodical was ''Wiking-Ruf''. Gille launched it in 1951 and it was initially aimed at the veterans of the SS Division ''Wiking''. Within its first year of existence, it became the official publication of HIAG. In 1955, it was renamed ''{{illm|Der Freiwillige|de|Der Freiwillige}}'' ("The Volunteer").{{sfn|Large|1987|p=84}} The 1952 editorial by Kumm highlighted key themes that were used throughout HIAG's subsequent history:{{sfn|Steiner|1975|p=278}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even during the war, and especially after the war, infamous and lying propagandists have been able to make use of all the unfortunate events connected to the Third Reich and also with the SS to destroy and drag through the mud all of what was and is sacred to us. (...) Let us be clear about it: the [Allied] battle was directed not only against the authoritarian regime of the Third Reich, but, above all, against the resurgence of the strength of the German people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Erich Kern]], a far-right Austrian journalist and a former Nazi war correspondent, became the organisation's key employee responsible for its publishing arm. He first became active within HIAG in 1955, and then joined as a full-time employee in 1959. According to the historian [[Jonathan Petropoulos]], Kern remained an "unrepentant and unreconstructed Nazi" up to his death in 1991.{{sfn|Petropoulos|2000|p=151}}

The theme of foreign volunteers was featured prominently, with Steiner lending his voice in this area. In a 1958 editorial, he praised the foreign volunteers who, like their German comrades, saw the "diabolical" threat of Bolshevism and "fought like lions" against it as part of the Waffen-SS. The picture books echoed the same themes; one of them proclaimed: "From all European lands came volunteers as genuine comrades-in-arms. They fought for their Fatherland against Bolshevism."{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=138}}

Glossy books such as ''Waffen-SS in Pictures'' (1957) featured, as described by MacKenzie, "tales of valour and heroism" and "propaganda photographs of Aryan-ideal volunteers from all over the Continent".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=138}} In 1973, HIAG produced a five-hundred page SS picture tome under the nostalgic title ''When All Our Brothers Are Silent''. Hausser spearheaded the project with [[Jochen Peiper]], a controversial Waffen-SS figure, as a contributor.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=215}} Other similar books included ''Scattered are the Traces'' (1979), ''Cavalry Divisions of the Waffen-SS'' (1982), ''Panzer Grenadiers of the 'Viking' Division in Pictures'' (1984) and many others. (One of the cavalry units in question, [[SS Cavalry Brigade]], was responsible for the murder of an estimated 23,700 Jews and others in July–August 1941 alone during the [[Pripyat swamps (punitive operation)|Pripyat swamps punitive operation]]. Its regimental commander Lombard reported eliminating close to 11,000 "plunderers" in the first two weeks the same operation.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=81–82}}{{sfn|Pieper|2015|p=120}})

===Public speeches===
HIAG leadership denied that there was any connection between the Waffen-SS and Nazi atrocities. In 1957, Paul Hausser wrote an open letter in ''Der Freiwillige'' to West Germany's minister of defence, stating that the concentration camp guard units ([[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]) served on external detail only, "without the possibility of interfering with the internal procedure". He did not mention that the guards accompanied prisoners to labour sites and that the commanders of concentration camps generally came from the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Tauber Volume I|1967|pp=337–338}}{{sfn|Tauber Volume II|1967|p=1163}} This apologist position also ignored the fact that the organisational structure of the SS tied Waffen-SS to the Nazi annihilation machine through the transfer of personnel between various SS units and the shifting responsibilities of the units themselves, as they might perform frontline duties at one time, and then be reassigned to "pacification actions" — the Nazi term for punitive operations — in the rear.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=257–281}}

Kurt Meyer embodied the voice of Waffen-SS apologists. Speaking before some 8,000 SS men at the HIAG convention in Karlsberg, Bavaria, in 1957, he stated that "SS troops committed no crimes, except the massacre at Oradour, and that was the action of a single man," who, moreover had died a "hero's death" before he could be court-martialed. Meyer also insisted that the Waffen-SS was a regular army outfit, just like any in the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=255–256}} On another occasion, Meyer publicly denounced the "regime" [West Germany] that could "honour traitors" but would vilify its soldiers. He condemned the notion of "collective guilt" and equated Jews and Jesuits to the Nazis and the Waffen-SS as all being victims of history and prejudice.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=93}} In the first instance, Meyer was most likely referring to [[Adolf Diekmann]] who was the senior officer present during the [[Oradour massacre]]. Meyer himself had served a lengthy prison term for his role in the [[Ardenne Abbey massacre#Trial of Kurt Meyer|Ardenne Abbey massacre]]. In the second instance, he was apparently referring to the members of the [[20 July plot]].{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=255–256}}{{sfn|Large|1987|p=93}}

The rhetoric of victimhood and pan-European unity continued well into the later history of HIAG. At Peiper's memorial in 1976, Hubert Meyer referenced Peiper's open letter from [[Landsberg Prison]], which had been previously quoted in Hausser's 1953 books:{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=296}}{{refn|group="n"|Hubert Meyer's speech later appeared in the November 1976 issue of ''Der Freiwillige''.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=416}}}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;For a broad public in Germany and even more throughout the rest of the world, [Peiper] has become the embodiment of that which all of us were clearly, intentionally and wrongly burdened in Nuremberg.... We have not forgotten what Jochen Peiper wrote to us from Landsberg Prison in 1952: "Don't forget that the first Europeans killed in action were in the units of the Waffen-SS, that the ones beaten to death during the post war period mostly were men from our ranks. They had become fair game because of their belief in the indivisibility of Western Europe. Remember these martyrs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Memoirs===
The memoirs of HIAG's leading members portrayed Waffen-SS men as "misunderstood idealists who fought honourably and well"{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}} and included quotations by former Wehrmacht generals endorsing the fighting skills of the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}} Steiner's, Meyer's and Hausser's books have been characterised by historian Charles Sydnor as the "most important works of [Waffen-SS] apologist literature".{{sfn|Sydnor|1990|p=319}} They demanded rehabilitation of the combat branch of the Nazi Party and presented Waffen-SS members as "soldiers just like any other".{{sfn|Sydnor|1990|p=319}}
* Paul Hausser's 1953 book ''[[Waffen-SS in Action]]'' (''Waffen-SS im Einsatz'') was the first major work by one of the HIAG leaders. It had an unmistakable connection to the Nazi origins of the Waffen-SS: the SS runes on the cover art and the SS motto ("My honour is called loyalty") embossed on the cloth cover. Former Wehrmacht general [[Heinz Guderian]] endorsed Waffen-SS troops in a foreword and referred to them as "the first realisation of the European idea". Hausser described the growth of the Waffen-SS into a so-called multinational force where foreign volunteers fought heroically as a "militant example of the great European idea".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}} ''Waffen-SS in Action'' was included in the index of objectionable war books maintained by West Germany's [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]]. The index was created in 1960 to limit the sale of such works to minors due to their chauvinism and glorification of violence.{{sfn|Tauber Volume I|1967|p=539}}
* Kurt Meyer's memoirs, ''Grenadiers'' (German: ''Grenadiere''), published in 1957, detailed his exploits at the front and served as an element of the rehabilitation campaign. He condemned the "inhuman suffering" that the Waffen-SS personnel had been subjected to "for crimes which they neither committed, nor were able to prevent".{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=256}} Sydnor referred to ''Grenadiere'' as "perhaps the boldest and most truculent of the apologist works".{{sfn|Sydnor|1973}}
* Felix Steiner published ''The Volunteers of Waffen-SS: Idea and sacrifice'' (German: ''Die Freiwilligen der Waffen-SS: Idee und Opfergang'') in 1958, stressing the theme of the purely military Waffen-SS,{{sfn|Sydnor|1990|p=319}} along with the notion that the Waffen-SS, by having drawn on European volunteers, could serve as a model of European unity.{{sfn|Tauber Volume I|1967|p=}}

Both Hausser and Steiner followed up their 1950s books with works published in the 1960s. Published in 1963, Steiner's book was called ''The Army of Outlaws'' ("Die Armee der Geächteten"). Hausser's work appeared in 1966 under the title ''Soldiers Like Any Other'' ("Soldaten wie andere auch").{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}} According to MacKenzie, the books' titles were symbolic of the Waffen-SS image that HIAG's leaders wanted to portray,{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}} while Sydnor describes this later generation of books as "equally tendentious".{{sfn|Sydnor|1973}} In addition to HIAG's own publishing house Munin Verlag (below),{{sfn|SPD Inquiry|2009|loc=Chapter III, Section 4}} similar books were also published by {{Illm|Plesse Verlag|de|Plesse-Verlag}} in Göttingen.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}}

===Munin Verlag imprint===
HIAG established its own publishing house—Munin Verlag—in 1958.{{sfn|SPD Inquiry|2009|loc=Chapter III, Section 4}} The name comes from [[Norse mythology]], popular with right-wing movements.{{sfn|Janson|2006|p=393}} [[Huginn and Muninn|Muninn]] is one of the two ravens that are the companions of the god [[Odin]]; ''muninn'' is [[Old Norse]] for "memory".{{sfn|Orchard|1997|p=115}}

The aim of the publishing house was to publish the works of former Waffen-SS members, in cooperation with HIAG.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|p=399}} Its authors were former Waffen-SS unit commanders or staff officers, who were members of HIAG.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|p=399}} The Munin Verlag titles did not go through the rigorous fact-checking processes common in peer-reviewed historical literature; they were revisionist accounts, unedited by professional historians, and presented the former Waffen-SS members' version of events.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|p=379}} Until HIAG's dissolution in 1992, Munin-Verlag published 57 titles.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|p=379}}

===Unit histories and biographies===
Waffen-SS unit histories were produced with assistance from HIAG from the 1950s. [[Walter Harzer]] took on the role of the official historian of HIAG, in charge of coordinating the writing of the histories of Waffen-SS divisions.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=215}} HIAG worked with historian [[Ernst Klink]] of the [[Military History Research Office (Germany)|Military History Research Office (MGFA)]] in Freiburg to screen materials donated to the {{Interlanguage link multi|German Federal Military Archive|de|3=Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv}} for any information that may have implicated units and personnel in questionable activity.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=215}}{{weasel inline|date=June 2018}} To rehabilitate the image of the force, HIAG underwrote the publication of works by right-wing academics sympathetic to the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Sydnor|1990|p=319}}

The unit narratives were extensive (often in several volumes) and strived for a so-called official representation of their history, backed by maps and operational orders. MacKenzie points out that "the older or the more famous the unit, the larger the work—to the point where no less than five volumes and well over 2,000 pages were devoted to the doings of the 2nd Panzer Division ''Das Reich''", authored by its former officer Otto Weidinger.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=138}}

The French author Jean-Paul Picaper, who studied the [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|Oradour massacre]] perpetrated by the men of the ''Das Reich'', notes the tendentious nature of Weidinger's narrative: it provided a sanitized version of history without any references to massacres. He argues that the unit histories, like other HIAG publications, focused on the "positive", "heroic" side of National Socialism.{{sfn|Picaper|2014}} The researcher Danny S. Parker notes similar efforts undertaken to rewrite the history of the ''Leibstandarte'' division.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=217}}{{refn|group="n"|According to Parker, "the way the old comrades wanted it remembered".{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=217}}}} HIAG worked with Rudolf Lehmann, chief of staff of [[1st SS Panzer Corps]], to produce what Parker calls an "exculpating multi-volume chronicle" of the division, even including the [[Malmedy massacre]]. HIAG involved a legal consultant to make sure the account would be within the framework of the strict German laws prohibiting glorification of the Nazi past.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=217}} The project also included the former chief of staff of the unit, Dietrich Ziemssen, who in 1952 produced a revisionist version of the massacre in his pamphlet ''Der Malmedy Prozess''.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=217, 390}}{{refn|group="n"|Danny Parker calls the pamphlet an "exculpatory manifesto" and writes: "The literary subversion worked. Now the SS veterans moved themselves from the prosecutors to the prosecuted!"{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=217}}}}

In the mid- to late 1970s, HIAG attempted to commission a favorable biography of Peiper, to stop "the bad rumors," according to a HIAG official. "We must steadfastly remain behind the wheel and direct this book ourselves, otherwise [Erich Kern] will do it," Harzer wrote to a fellow member in 1976. HIAG contemplated approaching (or approached) [[Herbert Reinecker]], a prolific screenwriter who had served in a propaganda company (''{{illm|Propagandakompanie|de|Propagandakompanie}}'') of the Waffen-SS, but nothing came out of it.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=298, 418}}

===Successes and outcomes===
By the mid-1950s, HIAG established an image that separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes that could not be denied to the ''[[Allgemeine-SS]]'' (security and police), the ''SS-Totenkopfverbände'' and the ''Einsatzgruppen''. The Waffen-SS was thus successfully integrated into the [[myth of the clean Wehrmacht]].{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}}

The positive image of the Waffen-SS indeed found a receptive audience during the Cold War. Senior Waffen-SS personnel were "not shy about suggesting that ''they'' had once organized and led a NATO-like army (and an elite one at that)", notes MacKenzie (emphasis in the original).{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}} John M. Steiner, in his 1975 work, points out that SS apologists, especially strongly represented in HIAG, stressed that they were the first to fight for Europe and Western civilisation against "Asiatic Communist hordes".{{sfn|Steiner|1975|p=96}}

Quoting German political journalist [[Karl Otto Paetel]] in his 1966 book, the historian George Stein writes that the works produced by HIAG's circle were "trying to prove only what no tolerably informed person has ever attempted to deny, viz., that the soldiers of the Waffen-SS were brave fighters, suffered big losses and, as far as they served in the front line, did not run exterminations camps".{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=258}} Stein notes that the apologists define the Waffen-SS "in the narrowest of terms" and are silent on the matter of war crimes. He notes that only a minority of men were implicated in known atrocities and that the most historically significant role of the Waffen-SS was in the battles for "Hitler's Europe". But "to recognise this is not to agree with the apologists who picture the overwhelming majority of the men of the Waffen-SS as idealistic, clean-living, decent and honourable soldiers," Stein writes.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=257-281, 293}}

Wilke argues that, by the 1970s, HIAG attained a monopoly on the historical representation of the Waffen-SS. Its recipe was simple and contained just four ingredients:
* The Waffen-SS was apolitical
* It was elite
* It was innocent of all war crimes or Nazi atrocities
* It was a European army par excellence, the Army of Europe.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|pp=379, 405}}

Historians dismiss, and even ridicule, this characterisation. Picaper labels it as a "self-panegyric",{{sfn|Picaper|2014}} while Large uses the words "extravagant fantasies about [Waffen-SS's] past and future".{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=111–112}} MacKenzie refers to HIAG's body of work as a "chorus of self-justification"{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=138}} and Stein as "apologetics".{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=252}} The historian James M. Diehl describes HIAG's claims of the Waffen-SS being the so-called fourth branch of the Wehrmacht as "false", and HIAG's insistence that the force was a precursor to NATO as "even more outrageous".{{sfn|Diehl|1993|p=225}}

==Transition into right-wing extremism==
In the 1960s, it became clear that the legal rehabilitation of the Waffen-SS was out of HIAG's reach. At the same time, attitudes in Germany were beginning to change. Waffen-SS veterans' activities were increasingly greeted by suspicion from the community, while the government and military planners came to the realisation that they could meet their goals of rearmament without them. HIAG was thus increasingly marginalised and ignored by political parties, while any pretence of moderation no longer served a purpose as no further benefits were forthcoming from the government.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=112–113}}{{sfn|Werther|Hurd|2014|pp=330–331}}
HIAG then began its drift into the [[Far-right politics in Germany|far right]], further retreating into its Nazi past. For a time, HIAG published a calendar that marked Nazi commemoration dates.{{sfn|Der Spiegel|2011}} Many of the organisation's founding members did not evolve with the times. For example, at least through the 1970s, Kumm remained "the ever unreformed Nazi enthusiast," according to Parker, who was given access to the previously closed HIAG archives.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=215}}

As the West German public's awareness of the SS atrocities grew in the 1970s and 1980s, the attitudes towards Waffen-SS veterans shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II.{{sfn|Werther|Hurd|2014|p=330}}

During the 1980s, the HIAG celebrations grew so large and bold they created enormous problems for the organisation's image, such as when a 1985 meeting turned into a public relations disaster. The press reported on the singing of forbidden Nazi songs, and clashes with demonstrators and Waffen-SS reenactors (SS reenacting was illegal in West Germany). In an even more damaging development, ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' investigative reporter {{illm|Gerhard Kromschröder|de|Gerhard Kromschröder}} infiltrated the meeting posing as a war buff. He later published a damning article called "Nazi Family Reunion" containing statements from Waffen-SS veterans that ranged from Holocaust denial to virulently anti-semitic comments and references to happy concentration camp inmates "singing like birds".{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=389–390}}

The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] monitored HIAG as a far-right organisation in its later history. It briefly went off the list of neo-Nazi and extremist groups in 1984, causing another controversy.{{sfn|JTA|1985}}{{sfn|NYT|1984}}

==Dissolution==
[[File:HIAG-Ulrichsberg.jpg|upright|thumb|"HIAG Ostsachsen" at the Ulrichsberg meeting at Ulrichsberg mountain in 2003]]

Increasingly ostracised, HIAG disbanded at the federal level in 1992.{{sfn|Werther|Hurd|2016|p=425}} HIAG's last chairman was Hubert Meyer, who provided access to the previously closed HIAG archives to several researchers, including Parker. Parker used the HIAG materials in his 2014 study of Joachim Peiper.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=425}}

''Der Freiwillige'' was still being published in the 2000s by a neo-Nazi press.{{sfn|Werther|Hurd|2014|p=331}} Regional HIAG chapters continued to exist through the 2000s, at least one into the 2010s.{{sfn|Werther|Hurd|2014|pp=332, 339}} These groups worked to maintain momentum through the recruitment of younger generations and through outreach to foreign veterans of the Waffen-SS, aided by the continued publication of ''Der Freiwillige''. "[Its] acclaimed aim, today [2014], is to link older and younger generations in a common cause," note the historians Steffen Werther and Madeleine Hurd. The publication's predominant theme continued to be "Europe against Bolshevism," with several editorials devoted to the idea that the Waffen-SS laid the foundation for the unification of Europe, expansion of NATO and "freedom of Fatherlands," as stated in one of the issues.{{sfn|Werther|Hurd|2014|pp=330–331}}

HIAG's informal successor was the international War Grave Memorial Foundation "When All Brothers Are Silent" (''Kriegsgräberstiftung 'Wenn alle Brüder schweigen'''), formed with a stated goal of maintaining war graves. In the 1990s and 2000s, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it worked on arranging new commemorative sites for the Waffen-SS dead in the former Soviet Union, including one in Ukraine.{{sfn|Werther|Hurd|2014|pp=332, 348–349}}

==Assessment and legacy==

HIAG never grew to the size of other West German veterans' organisations, the most successful of which, VdH, had membership approaching 500,000. Diehl, who studied postwar veterans' movements in West Germany, writes that the overwhelming majority of Waffen-SS veterans, who were more interested in rebuilding their civilian lives or getting too old to consider returning to military service, ignored ''Der Freiwillige''{{'}}s "fire-eating editorials".{{sfn|Diehl|1993|p=236}} HIAG's membership began to fall sharply in the 1960s, while the organisation itself was never a significant threat to democracy. "HIAG's main goal was pensions, not a restoration of the Third Reich," he notes.{{sfn|Diehl|1993|p=236}}{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=83–84}}

===Performance as lobby group===
HIAG's performance as a lobbying organisation was mixed. Large sees a "combination of resentment, myopia and inflated self-importance" in HIAG's efforts and attitudes. "[The campaign] to regain their 'honour' and exercise political influence (...) was only partially successful," he writes. He credits West Germany's government, major political parties and military planners with keeping sufficient distance from HIAG and other veterans' organisations to limit their role in the new republic and its armed forces. "In that respect, (...) Bonn was not Weimar," he concludes.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=111–112}} As a "crucible of historical revisionism" (in Picaper's definition),{{sfn|Picaper|2014}} HIAG attempted to rewrite and manipulate history.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=81}} &lt;!---The results are felt to this day in the public's perceptions and popular culture, with many works translated into English. The historians [[Ronald Smelser]] and [[Edward J. Davies]] write: "Unfortunately, the scholarly writings remained confined to a small audience, whereas the readership of the German authors (and their English-language spin-offs) was considerably larger." The authors note that "with a forty-year head start," the predominance of the German view, and the related fascination by Waffen-SS admirers, "hardly remains a mystery".{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=136}}---&gt;

===Revisionist tradition outside of HIAG===
{{Main article|Waffen-SS in popular culture}}

HIAG was instrumental in creating the [[Waffen-SS in popular culture|perception in popular culture]] of the Waffen-SS being "comrades-in-arms engaged in a noble crusade" (according to MacKenzie). West German researchers questioned these notions, but German society overall, wanting to forget the past, embraced the image. MacKenzie highlights the long-term effects of HIAG's revisionism:{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=139}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;As older generation of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has done much to perpetuate the image of the force as a revolutionary European army. The degree of admiration and acceptance varies, but the overall tendency to accentuate the positive lives on, or has indeed grown stronger.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The revisionist tradition continues to the present time, through popular history books, web sites and wargames. New titles appear every year, propagating the myths first put forth by HIAG's propaganda efforts. Some of the books are amateur historical studies that focus solely on the military aspects of the Waffen-SS. Others are reprints of apologetic accounts by former Waffen-SS personnel. Adding to the volume of material are groups of international admirers who consider the Waffen-SS to have been incorrectly judged by history.{{sfn|Pontolillo|2010}}

Some of the better known authors in the Waffen-SS revisionist tradition include Patrick Agte, who wrote a hagiographic account on [[Jochen Peiper]],{{sfn|Parker|2013|p=276}} and [[Franz Kurowski]], who provided numerous wartime chronicles of Waffen-SS units and highly decorated men, such as [[Michael Wittmann]].{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=173–178}} Critics have been especially dismissive of Kurowski's works, describing them as ''[[Der Landser|Landser]]-pulp'' ("soldier-pulp") literature and "laudatory texts", that focus on hero-making at the expense of the historical truth.{{sfn|Wilking|2004|p=79}}{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=251}}{{sfn|Hadley|1995|pp=137, 170}} Another prolific author, Mark Yerger, published 11 books up to 2008, mostly through [[Schiffer Publishing]].{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=159}}

According to MacKenzie, authors in the revisionist tradition range from "extreme admirers [on] the fringes of the far-right," such as [[Richard Landwehr]] and Jean Mabire, to partisan authors ([[Gordon Williamson (writer)|Gordon Williamson]] and Edmund L. Blandford), and popular historians who generally present the Waffen-SS in a positive light. These include [[John Keegan]], James S. Lucas and [[Bruce Quarrie]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=140}} The historian Henning Pieper notes non-scholarly works by Christopher Ailsby, Herbert Walther, and Tim Ripley as part of "[[militaria]] literature" genre (in his definition), while the military historian [[Robert Citino]] includes books by [[Willi Fey]] and Michael Reynolds among uncritical works aimed at "military history buffs".{{sfn|Citino|2012|p=322}}{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=8, 191}}

The '''Incense trade route''' comprised a network of major ancient land and sea trading routes linking the Mediterranean world with Eastern and Southern sources of incense, spices and other luxury goods, stretching from Mediterranean ports across the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]] through Northeastern Africa and [[Arabia]] to [[India]] and beyond. The incense land trade from South Arabia to the [[Mediterranean]] flourished between roughly the 7th century BC and the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name=UNESCO1&gt;{{cite web |title=Incense Route – Desert Cities in the Negev |publisher= UNESCO |url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Incense Route served as a channel for the trading of goods such as [[Arabian]] [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]];&lt;ref name=UNESCO1/&gt; from Southeast Asia [[India]]n [[spice]]s, [[precious stones]], [[pearls]], [[ebony]], [[silk]] and fine [[textiles]];&lt;ref name=Yemen1&gt;{{cite web |title=Traders of the Gold and Incense Road |publisher= Embassy of the Republic of Yemen, Berlin |url= http://www.botschaft-jemen.de/Geschichte.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070908173824/http://www.botschaft-jemen.de/Geschichte.htm |archivedate=2007-09-08 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the [[Horn of Africa]], rare woods, [[feathers]], animal skins, [[Somalia|Somali]] [[frankincense]], and gold.&lt;ref name=Yemen1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulric Killion, ''A Modern Chinese Journey to the West: Economic Globalisation And Dualism'', (Nova Science Publishers: 2006), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:Mer rouge1b.jpg|thumb|left|The incense trade, connecting Egypt to the incense-producing lands, depended heavily on navigation along the Red Sea.]]

The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] had traded in the [[Red Sea]], importing spices, gold and exotic wood from the "[[Land of Punt]]" and from Arabia.&lt;ref name=Rawlinson1&gt;Rawlinson 2001: 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Indian goods were brought in Arabian and Indian vessels to [[Aden]].&lt;ref name=Rawlinson1/&gt; Rawlinson identifies the long-debated "ships of [[Tarshish]]," as a [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] fleet equipped at [[Ezion-Geber]] that made several trading voyages to the east bringing back [[gold]], [[silver]], [[ivory]] and precious stones.&lt;ref name=Rawlinson1/&gt; These goods were transshipped at the port of [[Ophir]].&lt;ref name=Rawlinson1/&gt;

According to one historian:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{cquote|In the ancient period, it would seem that South Arabia and the [[Horn of Africa]] were the major suppliers of incense, while in modern times the commercial centre for the trade in gums has been Aden and [[Oman]]. Early ritual texts from Egypt show that incense was being brought to the upper [[Nile]] by land traders, but perhaps the most spectacular evidence of this trade is provided by the frescos dated to around 1500 BC on the walls of the temple at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] commemorating the journey of a fleet that the Queen of Egypt had sent to the [[Land of Punt]].&lt;ref&gt;This refers to [[Hatshepsut]]'s expedition of 1515 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Five ships are depicted in these reliefs, piled high with treasure, and one of them shows thirty-one small incense trees in tubs being carried on board.}}

{{cquote|The ''[[Periplus Maris Erythraei]]'' and other [[Periplus|Greek texts]] refer to several coastal sites in [[Somalia]], [[Southern Arabia]] and [[India]] involved with trade in [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]], [[bdellium]] and a range of gum resins termed ''duaka'' and ''kankamon'' and ''mok rotu.''}}

[[File:Map of Aksum and South Arabia ca. 230 AD.jpg|right|thumb|The economy of the [[Qataban|Kingdom of Qataban]] (light blue) was based on the cultivation and trade of spices and aromatics including [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]]. These were exported to the Mediterranean, India and [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] where they were greatly prized by many cultures, using camels on routes through Arabia, and to India by sea.]]

Among the most important trading points of the Incense Route from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea was [[Gerrha]] in the Persian Gulf, reported by the historian [[Strabo]] to have been founded by [[Babylonia]]n exiles as a [[Chaldea]]n colony.&lt;ref name=Larsen1&gt;Larsen 1983: 56&lt;/ref&gt; Gerrha exercised influence over the incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and controlled the [[aromatics]] trade to [[Babylon]] in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name=Larsen1/&gt; Gerrha was one of the important entry ports for goods shipped from India.&lt;ref name=Larsen1/&gt;

Due to its prominent position in the incense trade, [[Yemen]] attracted settlers from the [[Fertile Crescent]].&lt;ref name=Glasse1&gt;Glasse 2001: 59&lt;/ref&gt; The [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] trees were crucial to the economy of Yemen and were recognized as a source of wealth by its rulers.&lt;ref name=Glasse1/&gt; Recent exploration discovered an ancient trade route through eastern Yemen in the Mahra region.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, ''Ruins in Yemeni Desert Mark Route of Frankincense Trade'', The New York Times, JAN. 28, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Assyria]]n documents indicate that [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] advanced through [[Phoenicia]] to [[Gaza City|Gaza]].&lt;ref name=Edwards1&gt;Edwards 1969: 330&lt;/ref&gt; Gaza was eventually sacked and the ruler of Gaza escaped to Egypt but later continued to act as a [[vassal]] administrator.&lt;ref name=Edwards1/&gt; The motive behind the attack was to gain control of the South Arabian incense trade which had prospered along the region.&lt;ref name=Edwards1/&gt; 

[[File:Tilglath pileser iii.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Tiglath-Pileser III attacked Gaza in order to control trade along the Incense Route.&lt;ref name=Edwards1/&gt;]]

[[I.E.S. Edwards]] connects the [[Syro-Ephraimite War]] to the desire of the [[Israelites]] and the [[Aramaeans]] to control the northern end of the Incense Route, which ran up from Southern Arabia and could be tapped by commanding [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1969: 329&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological inscriptions also speak of booty retrieved from the land of the ''mu-u-na-a-a'', possibly ''Meunites'' mentioned in the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name=Edwards1/&gt; Some scholars identify this group as the [[Minaeans]] of South Arabia, who were involved with the incense trade and occupied the northern trading outposts of the Incense Route.&lt;ref name=Edwards1/&gt;

Aromatics from [[Dhofar]] and luxury goods from India brought wealth to the kingdoms of Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald 2001: 168&lt;/ref&gt; The aromatics of Dhofar were shipped out from the natural harbour of [[Khor Rori]] towards the western inhospitable South Arabian coast.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald 2001: 168–69&lt;/ref&gt; The caravans carried these products north to [[Shabwa]] and from there on to the kingdoms of [[Qataban]], [[Saba]], [[Ma'in]], and Palestine up to Gaza.&lt;ref name=Archibald1&gt;Archibald 2001: 169&lt;/ref&gt; The tolls levied by the owners of wells and other facilities added to the overall cost of these luxury goods.&lt;ref name=Archibald1/&gt;

==Greco-Roman bypassing of land routes==
[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|thumb|right|Roman maritime trade routes with India according to the [[Periplus Maris Erythraei]], 1st century AD. The Romans bypassed the land route in favour of the faster and safer searoute.]]
The [[Nabateans]] built [[Petra]],&lt;ref&gt;''City Of Stone'' Documentary&lt;/ref&gt; which stood halfway between the opening to the [[Gulf of Akaba]] and the [[Dead Sea]] at a point where the Incense Route from Arabia to [[Damascus]] was crossed by the overland route from [[Petra]] to [[Gaza City|Gaza]].&lt;ref name=Eckenstein1&gt;Eckenstein 2005: 86&lt;/ref&gt; This position gave the Nabateans a hold over the trade along the Incense Route.&lt;ref name=Eckenstein1/&gt; In order to control the Incense Route from the Nabatean a Greek military expedition lead by Swan was undertaken, without success, by [[Antigonus Cyclops]], one of [[Alexander of Macedonia]]'s generals.&lt;ref name=Eckenstein1/&gt; The Nabatean control over trade increased and spread to the West and the North.&lt;ref name=Eckenstein1/&gt; The replacement of [[Greece]] by the [[Roman empire]] as the administrator of the Mediterranean basin led to the resumption of direct trade with the east.&lt;ref name=Lach1&gt;Lach 1994: 13&lt;/ref&gt; According to a historian&lt;!---this should probably be reworded as fact. Skip the quote. Paraphrase--&gt; "The South Arabs in protest took to pirate attacks over the Roman ships in the [[Gulf of Aden]]. In response, the Romans destroyed [[Aden]] and favoured the Western Abyssinian coast of the Red Sea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monopoly of the Indian and Arab middlemen weakened with the development of monsoon trade by the Greeks through the discovery of the direct route to India ([[Hippalus]]), forcing the [[Parthia]]n and Arabian middlemen to adjust their prices so as to compete on the Roman market with the goods now being bought in by a direct sea route to India.&lt;ref name=Lach1/&gt; Indian ships sailed to Egypt as the maritime routes of Southern Asia were not under the control of a single power.&lt;ref name=Lach1/&gt;

{{cquote|The trade with Arabia and India in incense and spices became increasingly important, and Greeks for the first time began to trade directly with India. The discovery, or rediscovery, of the sea-route to India is attributed to a certain [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus|Eudoxos]], who was sent out for this purpose towards the end of the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II|Ptolemy Euergetes II]] (died 116 BC). Eudoxos made two voyages to India, and subsequently, having quarrelled with his Ptolemaic employers, perished in an unsuccessful attempt to open up an alternative sea route to India, free of Ptolemaic control, by sailing around Africa. The establishment of direct contacts between Egypt and India was probably made possible by a weakening of Arab power at this period, for the [[Sabaean]] kingdom of South-western Arabia collapsed and was replaced by [[Himyarite Kingdom]] around 115 BC. Imports into Egypt of cinnamon and other eastern spices, such as pepper, increased substantially, though the Indian Ocean trade remained for the moment on quite a small scale, no more than twenty Egyptian ships venturing outside the Red Sea each year.}}

[[Frankincense]] from [[Dhofar]] was collected at [[Khor Rori|Moscha (ancient Sumhuram)]]. It was shipped to [[Qana]] and taken overland to [[Shabwa]] and further North to [[Najran]], [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], [[Petra]] and to [[Gaza City|Gaza]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It was also shipped to [[Babylon]] and [[Palmyra]] via the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mei.edu/sqcc/frankincense Middle East Institute, The Story of Frankincense, Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman trade with India]] kept increasing, and according to Strabo (II.5.12.):&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Source]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|At any rate, when [[Cornelius Gallus|Gallus]] was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the [[Nile]] as far as [[Aswan|Syene]] and the frontiers of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Ethiopia]], and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from [[Myos Hormos]] to India, whereas formerly, under the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemies]], only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise.}}

{{cquote|The third century would thus appear to be a significant time in the history of the incense trade in Arabia. During [[Crisis of the Third Century|the political and economic crisis of that century]] the nature of the trade changed dramatically; prior to that time the incense route from South Arabia seems to have continued to function. Much of this trade seems to have been brought to a standstill by the poor economic conditions of the third century, however, when the economic situation improved again under the [[Tetrarchy]] many things had changed. By this time, the two main routes in use seem to have been the [[Wadi Sirhan]], now carrying trade which formerly would have passed through [[Palmyra]], and [[Aqaba|Aila]], receiving goods from India and Arabia which before had gone to the Egyptian Red Sea ports.}}
[[File:Sassanid Empire 620-627.svg|thumb|right|[[Sassanian Empire]] in 602 to 629]]

At the end of the sixth century [[Isidore of Seville]] enumerated the aromatics still being imported into [[Visigothic Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Isidore: "Aromatics are those perfumed odours sent to us by India, the Arabian regions and other places besides. And aromatics seem to derive their name either from their use on the altars of the gods, or because we see that they spread forth and mingle with the air" (''Libri differentiarum sive de proprietate sermonum'', quoted in Maguelonne Toussant-Samat, Anthea Bell, tr. ''The History of Food'', revised ed. 2009, p. 434); since sacrifice to the gods had been proscribed for more than two centuries, Isidore may simply have been repeating an old list.&lt;/ref&gt; Of aromatic trees (''de arboris aromaticis'') Isidore listed in his encyclopedia [[myrrh]], [[Black pepper|pepper]],  [[cinnamon]], ''amomum'' ([[cardamom]]?) and [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]]; of aromatic herbs (''de herbis aromaticis''), [[Spikenard|nard]], [[saffron]], cardamom, will have arrived through the trade routes, others were available in Spain: thyme, aloes, rose, violet, lily, [[gentian]], [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[fennel]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of the incense trade saw Yemen take to the export of [[coffee]] via the Red Sea port of [[Mocha, Yemen|al-Mocha]].&lt;ref&gt;Colburn 2002: 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|220px|Egypt under the rule of the [[Rashidun]]. {{Legend|#a1584e|Prophet Mohammad, 622–632}} {{Legend|#ef9070|Patriarchal Caliphate, 632–661}} {{Legend|#fad07d|Umayyad Caliphate, 661–750}}|left]]Following the [[Roman-Persian Wars]] the areas under the Roman [[Byzantine Empire]] were captured by [[Khosrow I]] of the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] Sassanian Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Farrokh 2007: 252&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs, led by [['Amr ibn al-'As]], crossed into Egypt in late 639 or early 640.&lt;ref name=Meri1&gt;Meri 2006: 224&lt;/ref&gt;

This advance marked the beginning of the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt]]&lt;ref name=Meri1/&gt; and the fall of ports such as [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;Holl 2003: 9&lt;/ref&gt; used to secure trade with India by the Greco-Roman world since the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay 2006: 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the [[Ottoman Turks]] conquered [[Constantinople]] in the 15th century, marking the beginning of Turkish control over the most direct trade routes between Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia Americana|The Encyclopedia Americana]] 1989: 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present status==
[[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Committee]] meeting in November 27, 2000 in [[Cairns]], [[Australia]] attached [[World Heritage Site]] status to [[Frankincense Trail|The Frankincense Trail]] in [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =  World Heritage Committee Inscribes 61 New Sites on World Heritage List | publisher = UNESCO| url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official citation reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =  Land of Frankincense| publisher = UNESCO| url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Avdat view to the Negev.JPG|thumb|Ruins of [[Avdat]].|370px|right]]

{{cquote|The [[frankincense]] trees of Wadi Dawkah and the remains of the caravan oasis of Shisr/Wubar and the affiliated ports of [[Khor Rori]] and Al-Balid vividly illustrate the trade in [[frankincense]] that flourished in this region for many centuries, as one of the most important trading activities of the ancient and medieval world.}}

The World Heritage Committee, headed by Themba Wakashe, recorded [[Incense Route - Desert Cities in the Negev]] on UNESCO’s World Heritage List on July 15, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =   Mostar, Macao and Biblical vestiges in Israel are among the 17 cultural sites inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List| publisher = UNESCO| url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official citation reads:&lt;ref name=UNESCO1/&gt;

{{cquote|The four Nabatean towns of [[Haluza]], [[Mamshit]], [[Avdat]] and [[Shivta]], along with associated fortresses and agricultural landscapes in the [[Negev Desert]], are spread along routes linking them to the Mediterranean end of the Incense and Spice route. Together they reflect the hugely profitable trade in [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] from [[South Arabia]] to the Mediterranean, which flourished from the 3rd century B.C. until to 2nd century A.D. With the vestiges of their sophisticated irrigation systems, urban constructions, forts, and caravanserai they bear witness to the way in which the harsh desert was settled for trade and agriculture.}}

==Early life==
Bardon was born in Dublin in 1941 and graduated from [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/about/ BBC Northern Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, in 1964, he moved to [[Belfast]] to begin his teaching career at Orangefield Boys Secondary School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofHistory/SchoolContactDetails/StaffListing/DrJonathanBardon/ Queens University, Belfast Faculty Biography of Dr. Jonathan Bardon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403124104/http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofHistory/SchoolContactDetails/StaffListing/DrJonathanBardon/ |date=2007-04-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Belfast, he enrolled at [[Queens University, Belfast]], where he received a Diploma in Education, also in 1964.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Living in [[Northern Ireland]] as a young man during the beginning of [[the Troubles]], he credits two things that piqued his fascination with it, while remaining nonpolitical: his early teaching experiences educating young boys, both [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]], in Belfast; and a five feature commission he received from the now-defunct ''Sunday Times'' to write about and research the [[Battle of the Somme]].&lt;ref&gt;Bardon, Jonthan.

==Career==
Bardon is best known for his critically acclaimed text, ''A History of Ulster''.  The book examines, in detail, the cultural, social, economic, and political arenas of the province, beginning with the [[Ulster#Early history|early settlements]] and progressing linearly to present-day Ulster.

He has also written numerous radio and television programmes on the subject of [[Northern Ireland]].  Most recently he was commissioned by [[BBC Radio]] to create a two hundred and forty-episode series entitled ''A Short History of Ireland''.  The final episode aired on 18 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio Ulster.  [http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/radioulster/ashorthistory/roundup.shtml ''A Short History of Ulster''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Bardon received an [[OBE]] for "services to community life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2045970.stm ''New honour for Sir Ronnie''].  BBC News.  15 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Karl Marx Library''' is a topically-organized series of original translations and biographical commentaries edited by historian and [[Karl Marx]] scholar [[Saul K. Padover]] (1905-1981) and published by academic publisher [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill Books]].  Originally projected as a 13 volume series at the time of its launch in 1971, ultimately only 7 volumes found print prior to Padover's death, supplemented by a biography and an unnumbered volume of selected correspondence.

The scholarly utility of the series was severely undermined by the 1975 launch of the 50 volume ''[[Marx-Engels Collected Works]]'' project jointly published by [[Progress Publishers]] of Moscow, [[International Publishers]] of New York City, and [[Lawrence and Wishart]] of London. The abruptly-terminated series proved to be a short-lived focal point for Marx scholarship during the first half of the decade of the 1970s.

The formal Karl Marx Library series was terminated in 1977, with two tangential volumes by Padover subsequently published during the last years of his life, including a full-length biography of Marx.

==Publication history==

===Launch===

An ambitious scholarly project entitled "The Karl Marx Library" was launched in 1971 by historian and [[Karl Marx]] scholar [[Saul K. Padover]].&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;Z.A. Jordan, "Reviewed Work: ''Karl Marx On Revolution'' by Saul K. Padover," ''American Political Science Review,'' vol. 68, no. 4 (Dec. 1974), pp. 1743-1744. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1959969 In JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 13 volumes were projected for the series, each to contain new translations of full or extracted writings by Marx dealing with a specific topical themes.&lt;ref name=Jordan /&gt; The academic utility of the series was questioned even at the time of its initial launch, with journal reviewer Z.A. Jordan of [[Carleton University]] making note of a recent announcement that Communist Party publishers [[Lawrence and Wishart]] (UK) and [[International Publishers]] (USA) were to begin complete translation and publication of the massive ''[[Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe]]'' (MEGA) produced by [[Karl Dietz Verlag Berlin]] starting in 1958.&lt;ref name=Jordan /&gt;

"This development is bound to reduce the usefulness of Dr. Padover's series on which he must have expended much energy and time-consuming effort," Jordan presciently predicted.&lt;ref name=Jordan /&gt;

===''On Revolution'' (1971)===

The first volume of the series, ''On Revolution'' (1971) broke little original ground for Marx scholars, containing only a spate of articles from the 1850s from [[Horace Greeley|Horace Greeley's]] ''[[New York Tribune]]'' on the contemporary situation in [[Spain]] that were not already readily available in other publications.&lt;ref name=Jordan /&gt; Padover's failure to maintain a chronological presentation of documents was criticized by one reviewer, who observed that Marx's own views on the nature and time span of the revolutionary process evolved considerably during the second half of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=Jordan /&gt; Padover's lengthy introduction to the first volume, "Karl Marx as Revolutionist," was likewise criticized as biographical rather than introductory to the material presented and the book's bibliography was panned as "highly selective, if not parochial" for its lack of works published outside the United States.&lt;ref name=Jordan /&gt;

Another academic reviewer was no less harsh, declaring that "unfortunately, the best that can be said about the volume's scholarly apparatus is that it is all but swallowed up in the 600-odd pages of authentic, or nearly authentic, Marx texts."&lt;ref name=Ferg&gt;A. Thomas Ferguson, Jr. and Stephen J. O'Neil, "Marx's Writings on Revolution: ''Karl Marx: On Revolution'' by Saul K. Padover," ''The Review of Politics,'' vol. 35, no. 2 (April 1973), pp. 260-262. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1406170 In JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; Padover was lauded for judicious selection of documents and "capable" translation, with the inclusion of selected correspondence singled out as particularly illuminating.&lt;ref name=Ferg /&gt; His own editorial contribution was deemed to be problematic, however, with Padover's bibliographic notes said to "contain more errors of commission and omission" than could be conveniently cited in short academic review.&lt;ref name=Ferg /&gt; Padover's failure to print Marx's writings in concert with those of his friend and co-thinker [[Frederick Engels]] was also cause for criticism.&lt;ref name=Ferg /&gt;

Beyond Padover's introductory and supplemental material the contents of the first volume were divided into five parts, dealing in turn with general principles of revolutionary theory, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]],'' and journalism related to specific revolutionary events in France, Germany, and Spain.

===''On Freedom of the Press and Censorship'' (1974)===

''On Freedom of the Press and Censorship,'' the fourth of the scheduled 13 volumes of the Karl Marx Library, saw print in 1974. The book's importance was already diminished by the forthcoming appearance of initial volumes of the ''Marx-Engels Collected Works'' through a well-funded international effort spearheaded by three Communist Party-related publishing houses.&lt;ref name=JordanFPC&gt;Z. A. Jordan, ''"Karl Marx on Freedom of the Press and Censorship'' by Saul K. Padover," ''American Political Science Review,'' vol. 72, no. 1 (March 1978), pp. 227-229. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953626 In JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Padover was again taken to task by Z.A. Jordan in the pages of the ''[[American Political Science Review]],'' with Jordan particularly questioning the decision to treat Marx in binary terms as a "Revolutionist" and an "Embattled Journalist" — with the former writing dealing with the [[Revolutions of 1848]] split out into the volume ''On Revolution'' and other writing presented as the work of a "fighting journalist" engaged in a dedicated effort to win [[freedom of the press]] and abolition of censorship in Germany.&lt;ref name=JordanFPC /&gt; Jordan considered such a division to be a "doubtful" assumption, noting that Marx's primary fight as a journalist by the time of his ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' editorship had been not for freedom of the press per se, but rather "to stem the rising tide of the counter-revolution, led by the King of Prussia and his ministers, who used censorship effectively, to restrict the activities of their political opponents and, finally, to silence the opposition altogether."&lt;ref name=JordanFPC /&gt;

As a result, Jordan argued, the ''On Freedom of the Press and Censorship'' collection unsatisfactory, particularly for its "disappointingly inadequate" selection of material from the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' and failure to document the evolution of Marx's political thinking on censorship matters over time.&lt;ref name=JordanFPC /&gt;

Structurally speaking, ''On Freedom of the Press and Censorship'' was divided into four sections. The first dealt with the young Marx's writing for the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]],'' a second on writing for its successor publication the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]],'' a third with personal letters by Marx, with a final section containing official documents and correspondence dealing with Marx's alleged transgressions with the censorship as editor of the two [[Rhineland|Rhenish]] newspapers with which he was associated.&lt;ref name=JordanFPC /&gt;

===''On Religion'' (1974)===

Padover's fifth topical volume of the Karl Marx Library, ''On Religion,'' drew significant academic attention beyond the more typical scholarly province of intellectual history and the history of the labor movement. Writing in the ''[[Catholic Historical Review]],'' Joseph O'Malley of [[Marquette University]] observed that "Marx's idea of religion, as shown in these excerpts, remained one and fixed throughout his adult life," and that religion to Marx "at best provides some individuals the diversion of an illusory solace and at worst acts in and on society as an anti-human force."&lt;ref name=JO&gt;Joseph O'Malley, ''"On Religion'' by Karl Marx; Saul K. Padover," ''Catholic Historical Review,'' vol. 63, no. 4 (Oct. 1977), pp. 593-594. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25020182 In JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Malley further observed that "it appears that Marx never entertained the slightest doubt about the atheism he had adopted by the age of nineteen."&lt;ref name=JO /&gt;

Despite his intimations of the collection's merits, Padover was again taken to task by O'Malley for certain editorial errors, including attribution of the article "Luther as Arbiter Between Strauss and Feuerbach" to Marx rather than to [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], as new scholarship had revealed.&lt;ref name=JO /&gt;

Writing in the ''[[Journal of Church and State]],'' Elmer H. Duncan welcomed Padover's effort as a "useful" collection of Marx's writing on religious topics, "gleaned from many, perhaps most, of his published works.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;Elmer H. Duncan, ''"Karl Marx on Religion.'' "Karl Marx Library," vol. 5 by Saul K. Padover," ''Journal of Church and State,'' vol. 19, no. 1 (Winter 1977), pp. 106-108. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23914708 In JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Calling the book "invaluable" to readers interested in Marx's personal views on religion, Duncan found fault with the shortness of the book's constituent sections and the aspect of compilation of writings produced over a number of years into a single topical heading.&lt;ref name=Duncan /&gt; Noting the [[rabbi|rabbinically]]-descended Marx's "intense ''hatred'' of Jews and of the Jewish faith," Duncan coyly noted that some purple passages with [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] overtones "should guarantee that this book will be of interest to theologians, philosophers, political scientists, economists, and psychologists."&lt;ref name=Duncan /&gt;

The structure of the fifth volume included a 19-page introductory essay by Padover followed by division of the textual material into three parts, dealing with "Christianity and Religion in General," "Judaism and the Jews," and "Personal Letters."&lt;ref name=JO /&gt; Material within each of these sections followed a chronological approach, marked by ample editorial annotation.&lt;ref name=JO /&gt;

'''Linjiang''' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:临|临]][[wikt:江|江]] |t=臨江 |p=Línjiāng}}; listed as Linkiang on old maps) is a [[county-level city]] in southern [[Jilin]] province, People's Republic of China, located to the east of [[Tonghua]], and not far from the border with [[North Korea]]. It is a county-level city under the administration of [[Baishan]].

== Culture ==
During 1953–76, there are totally twenty one Chinese films being shoot on location in Linjiang, including ''[[Visitors on the Icy Mountain]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Changguo|date=|year=2014|title=临江——一座小城21部老电影|trans-title=|url=http://www.dili360.com/cng/article/p53ed7582a2fd556.htm|journal=Chinese National Geography|language=zh|volume=|issue=8|pages=172-189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Linjiang has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa''), with long, very cold winters, and very warm, humid summers. Monthly average temperatures range from {{convert|−15.6|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|22.4|°C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|5.30|°C|1}}. Though the annual total is generous, precipitation is quite low during the winter and rainfall is concentrated in the months of June through August. Sunshine is generous but falling far short of the central and western parts of Jilin; with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 42% in July to 60% in February, there are 2,232 hours of bright sunshine annually.

[[File:Max-I-Dimont.jpg|thumb|right|Max I. Dimont.]]
'''Max Isaac Dimont''' (12 August 1912 – 25 March 1992) was a [[Finnish American]] historian and author.

== Early life ==
Raised in a [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Helsinki]], [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], Dimont came to the [[Finnish-American|United States]] in August 1929 with his mother and his siblings. On the steerage passenger list of their ship, SS ''Berengaria'' his place of birth is listed as [[Kaunas|Kovno, Lithuania]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]].

On arrival, he was sent to the [[Ellis Island]] hospital after being certified as suffering from "simple [[goiter]]." He was discharged on August 10 and the family set out for [[Cleveland]], Ohio.

He taught himself the English language by reading [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], the [[Authorized King James Version|King James version]] of the [[Bible]], and American plays.

==Career==
After serving with U.S. Army intelligence in [[World War II]], Dimont worked in [[public relations]] and [[human resources]] for [[Edison Brothers Stores]] in [[St. Louis]], Missouri.

In 1962, he published ''[[Jews, God and History]]'', which received critical acclaim and has sold over 1.5 million copies. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has praised the book as "unquestionably the best popular history of the Jews written in the English language." After its publication, he traveled and lectured extensively on [[Jewish history]] throughout the United States, Canada, South Africa, Brazil, and Finland.

Other works include ''The Indestructible Jews'', ''The Jews in America'', and ''Appointment in Jerusalem''.

==Death and legacy==
Dimont died in 1992 in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. He had been at work on a second edition of ''Jews, God and History'' which was not yet finished. His wife, Ethel, who had worked with him on this since 1955, completed his work after his death and published the second edition in 1994, with the assistance of their daughter, Gail Goldey.

At the core of the movement were the members of the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], who included [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Matthew Boulton]], [[James Watt]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Josiah Wedgwood]], [[James Keir]] and [[Thomas Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budge|2007|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable figures included the author [[Anna Seward]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dick|2008|pp=567, 577–578}}&lt;/ref&gt; the painter [[Joseph Wright of Derby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Baird|first1=Olga|last2=Dick|first2=Malcolm|year=2004|contribution=Joseph Wright of Derby: Art, the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution|contribution-url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf|title=Revolutionary Players|publisher=Museums, Libraries and Archives - West Midlands|url=http://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American colonist, botanist and poet [[Susanna Wright]], the lexicographer [[Samuel Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Ritchie|first1=Stefka|last2=Dick|first2=Malcolm|year=2004|contribution=“The occurrences of common life”: Samuel Johnson, Practical Science and Industry in the Midlands|contribution-url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/88/83/257.rtf|title=Revolutionary Players|publisher=Museums, Libraries and Archives - West Midlands|url=http://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the typographer [[John Baskerville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Ritchie|first1=Stefka|last2=Dick|first2=Malcolm|year=2004|contribution=John Baskerville and Benjamin Franklin: A Trans-Atlantic Friendship|contribution-url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/99/97/333.rtf|title=Revolutionary Players|publisher=Museums, Libraries and Archives - West Midlands|url=http://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the poet and landscape gardener [[William Shenstone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Anon|year=2004|contribution=William Shenstone, The Leasowes, and Landscape Gardening|contribution-url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/default.asp?theme=434&amp;originator=%2Fengine%2Fcustom%2Fpeople.asp&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=5155&amp;text=0&amp;resource=1345|title=Revolutionary Players|publisher=Museums, Libraries and Archives - West Midlands|url=http://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the architects [[James Wyatt]] and [[Samuel Wyatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Baird|first=Olga|year=2004|contribution=The Wyatts, Architects of the Age of Enlightenment|contribution-url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/default.asp?theme=436&amp;originator=%2Fengine%2Fcustom%2Fplace.asp&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=4859&amp;text=1&amp;resource=2008|title=Revolutionary Players|publisher=Museums, Libraries and Archives - West Midlands|url=http://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Midlands Enlightenment has attracted less study as an intellectual movement than the European Enlightenment of thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]], or the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] of [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], it dominated the experience of the Enlightenment within [[England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budge|2007|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its leading thinkers had international influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valsania|Dick|2004|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the Midlands Enlightenment formed a pivotal link between the earlier [[Scientific Revolution]] and the later [[Industrial Revolution]], facilitating the exchange of ideas between experimental science, polite culture and practical technology that enabled the technological preconditions for rapid economic growth to be attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2009|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its participants such as Boulton, [[Susanna Wright]], Watt and Keir were fully integrated into the exchange of scientific and philosophical ideas among the intellectual elites of Europe, the British American colonies and the new United States, but were simultaneously engaged in solving the practical problems of technology, economics and manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2009|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thus formed a natural bridge across the science-technology divide, where the "abstract knowledge" of [[chemistry]] and [[Newtonian mechanics]] could become the "useful knowledge" of technological development, the results of which could in turn feed back into the wider scientific knowledge-base,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2009|pp=14, 232}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a "chain-reaction of innovation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2009|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Susanna Wright]] was involved in analogous thinking in the biological sciences and law in the American colonies and early United States, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic, north of the [[Mason–Dixon line]]; she was born in 1697 in [[Warrington]] in [[Lancashire]] and moved to colonial Pennsylvania in her late teens in 1718 (following her parents four years earlier) after being educated in the Midlands.

The thinkers of the Midlands Enlightenment did not limit themselves to practical matters of utilitarian value, however, and their influence was not confined to their significance in the development of modern industrial society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2009|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of the Midlands Enlightenment were to be highly influential in the birth of British [[romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budge|2007|pp=158, 159}}; {{Harvnb|Valsania|Dick|2004|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the poets [[Percy Shelley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ruston|first=Sharon|title=Shelley’s Links to the Midlands Enlightenment: James Lind and Adam Walker|journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=30|issue=2|year=2007|pages=227–241|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.2007.tb00334.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wordsworth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Budge|first=Gavin|title=Erasmus Darwin and the Poetics of William Wordsworth: ‘Excitement without the Application of Gross and Violent Stimulants’|journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=30|issue=2|year=2007|pages=279–308|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.2007.tb00337.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Barnes|first=Alan|title=Coleridge, Tom Wedgwood and the Relationship between Time and Space in Midlands Enlightenment Thought|journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=30|issue=2|year=2007|pages=243–260|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.2007.tb00335.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Blake]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Green|first=Matthew|title=Blake, Darwin and the Promiscuity of Knowing: Rethinking Blake’s Relationship to the Midlands Enlightenment|journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=30|issue=2|year=2007|pages=193–208|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.2007.tb00332.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; all having intellectual connections to its leading thinkers, and Midlands Enlightenment thought was also influential in the spheres of [[education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dick|2008|pp=569–570}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolution|evolutionary biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Elliott|first=Paul|title=Erasmus Darwin, Herbert Spencer, and the Origins of the Evolutionary Worldview in British Provincial Scientific Culture, 1770-1850|journal=Isis|volume=94|issue=1|year=2003|pages=1–29|jstor=3653341|pmid=12725102|doi=10.1086/376097}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[botany]], and [[medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Levere|first=Trevor H.|title=Dr Thomas Beddoes (1760-1808) and the Lunar Society of Birmingham: Collaborations in Medicine and Science|journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=30|issue=2|year=2007|pages=209–226|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.2007.tb00333.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Midlands Enlightenment was connected to earlier Midlands radical religious reform of establishment of [[Catholic Church]] and [[Holy Roman Empire]] laws and ideology, including the founding of the [[Society of Friends]] in [[Lancashire]] by followers of [[Margaret Fell]] and [[George Fox]], and Midlands nonviolent [[political radicalism]] that led to the documentation of the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Jones|first=Peter M.|title=Living the Enlightenment and the French Revolution: James Watt, Matthew Boulton, and their Sons|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=42|issue=1|date=March 1999|pages=157–182|jstor=3020899|doi=10.1017/s0018246x98008139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oradea''' ({{IPA-ro|oˈrade̯a}}; {{lang-de|link=no|Großwardein}}, {{lang-hu|Nagyvárad}}, &lt;small&gt;Hungarian pronunciation&lt;/small&gt;: {{convertIPA-hu|n|a|gy|v|á|r|a|d}}, colloquially also ''{{lang|hu|Várad}}'', former {{lang-tr|Varat}}, {{lang-yi|גרויסווארדיין}} ''{{lang|yi-Latn|Groysvardeyn}}'') the capital city of [[Bihor County]] and [[Crișana]] region, is one of the important centers of economic, social and cultural development in the western part of [[Romania]], retaining these characteristics throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Oradea|title=Oradea {{!}} Romania|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is located in the north-west of [[Romania]], nestled between hills on the [[Crișana]] plain,  on the banks of [[Crișul Repede River]], that divides the city into almost equal halves. 

Located about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Borș, the most important crossing point on the west border (with [[Hungary]]), Oradea ranks tenth in size among Romanian cities; it covers an area of {{convert|11,556|ha}}. The city is at an altitude of 126 m above sea level, in the opening of the Criș valley and the plain area, in an area of contact between the extensions of the Apuseni Mountains and the extended plain Crișana-Banat. It lies as the area of transition from relief hills, to the Pannonian plain. City topoclimatic action is determined by the prevailing Western winds. Climate is Temperate Continental ([[Köppen climate classification]] Dfb), with some oceanic influences.

==Geography==
The city lies at the meeting point of the Crișana plain and the [[Crișul Repede River|Crișul Repede]]'s basin. It is situated 126 meters above sea level, surrounded on the north-eastern part by the hills of Oradea, part of the Șes hills. The main part of the settlement is situated on the floodplain and on the terraces situated down the river Crișul Repede. Oradea is famous for its thermal springs. The river Crişul Repede crosses the city right through the center, providing it with a picturesque beauty. Its flow depends on the season; the dykes near [[Tileagd]] have partly controlled it since they were built in the early 1980s.

Annual average temperature is {{convert|10.4|°C|°F}}. In July the average is about {{convert|21|°C|°F}}, while in January the average is {{convert|1.4|°C|°F}}. Rainfall is enough to support the woods and vegetation of the zone, registering an annual average of about {{convert|585.4|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is variably distributed throughout the year, with a maximum in June and a minimum in the late Autumn and Winter months of the year.

==History==
[[File:Fn braun-varadinum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Varadinum (Oradea) in a 1617 engraving by Braun &amp; Hogenberg]]
{{Main article|History of Oradea}}
While modern Oradea is first mentioned in 1113, under the [[Latin]] name "'''Varadinum'''" in a diploma belonging to [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Zobor Abbey]] – Bishop Sixtus Varadiensis and Saul de Bychar are mentioned in the document – recent archaeological findings, in and around the city, provide evidence of a more or less continuous habitation since the Neolithic.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The [[Dacians]] and [[Boii|Celts]] also inhabited the region. After the conquest of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] established a presence in the area, most notably in the [[Salca]] district of the city and modern day [[Băile Felix]].&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cataldi Raffaele |author2=Hodgson Susan |author3=Lund John |title=Stories from a Heated Earth, Our Geothermal Heritage|year=1999|publisher=Geothermal Resources Council|page=245|isbn=0934412197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Brill. ''Rumanian Studies, Vol. 3''. [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement that would become the city of Oradea is considered to have been relatively unimportant until the 11th century when [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. King Ladislaus I]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] founded a [[Diocese|bishopric]] near it, the present [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea]]. The city flourished both economically and culturally during the 13th century as part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. It was at this time that the [[Citadel]] of Oradea, first mentioned in 1241 during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]], was first built. It would be destroyed and rebuilt several times over the course of following centuries. The 14th and 15th centuries would prove to be of the most prosperous periods in the city's history up to that point. Many works of art would be added to the city, including: statues of St. Stephen, Emeric and Ladislaus (before 1372) and the [[equestrian sculpture]] of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. King Ladislaus I]] (1390) were erected in Oradea. St. Ladislaus' fabled statue was the first proto-renaissance public square equestrian in Europe. Bishop Andreas Báthori (1329–1345) rebuilt the Cathedral in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. From that [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] dates also the Hermes, now preserved at [[Győr]], which contains the skull of St. Ladislaus, and which is a masterpiece of the Hungarian goldsmith's art.

It was at this time that astronomer [[Georg von Peuerbach]] wrote his ''Tabula Varadiensis'', published posthumously in 1464, at (?) the Observatory of Varadinum, establishing the city's observatory as the Earth's point of reference and prime meridian.

In 1474, the city was captured by the Turks after a protracted siege. Their mostly tolerant policies towards others peoples ensured that the city would become an ethnic mosaic of [[Romanians]], [[Hungarians]], [[Austrians]], [[Slovaks]], [[Hebrews]], [[Ruthenians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]],&lt;ref name="istorie1"&gt;[http://www.lego.rdsor.ro/tont/oradea/rom/istorie/istorie.html Colegiul Național ''Emanuil Gojdu'' – Istoria orașului Oradea]. Retrieved 2009-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="istorie2"&gt;[http://www.oradea-online.ro/oradea/2/istorie_cronologie.htm Oradea-Online – Istoria Oradiei]. Retrieved 2009-07-21&lt;/ref&gt; causing Oradea to grow as an urban area starting with the 16th century.

After the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion of Hungary]], in the 16th century, the city became a constant point of contention between the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The Peace of Várad was concluded between [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand I]] and [[John Zápolya]] here on 4 February 1538, in which they mutually recognized each other as legitimate monarchs.

Following [[Michael the Brave]]'s conquest of the Principality of Transylvania, the Ottomans sent a punitive expedition that laid siege to the city in 1598, however the siege failed. After Michael's assassination in 1601 and the Peace of Vienna of 1603, the city was permanently incorporated in the Principality of Transylvania by imperial decree.

As a result of [[Gyorgy Rakoczi II]]'s, at the time [[Prince of Transylvania]] failed attempt to gain the throne of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] the Ottomans sent yet another punitive expedition against him and his [[Gheorghe Ştefan|Wallachian]] and [[Constantin Serban|Moldavian]] allies. The expedition failed, but it gave the Romanian chronicler [[Miron Costin]] the occasion to write the first full chronicle about the city, ''Oradiia''. In 1660 the Ottomans, with a force of 45000 men, besieged the city for the last time. The 850 defenders managed to hold out for 46 days, but eventually the city fell on the 27th of August due to internal treachery. The Ottomans would establish the city as the capital of the newly formed [[Varat Eyalet|Eyalet of Varat]]. The [[eyalet]] included the sanjaks of '''Varat''' (Oradea), [[Salonta|Salanta]], [[Debrecen|Debreçin]], [[Nagyhalász|Halmaș]], [[Săcueni|Sengevi]] and [[Balmazújváros|Yapıșmaz]]. The siege itself is described in detail by [[Szalárdy János]] in his contemporary chronicle. Ottoman dominance of the city ended in 1692, when, the Habsburg imperial forces conquered the city after a 14-month siege.

[[File:Oradea 1897.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Oradea's map in 1897]]
Under the Habsburgs, the city entered its golden age. The [[Vienna|Viennese]] engineer [[Franz Anton Hillebrandt]] given the task of planning the city in the [[Baroque]] style and, starting with the year 1752, many of the city's current landmarks were constructed such as the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Mary, Oradea|Roman Catholic Cathedral]], the Moon Church, the State Theatre and the [[Episcopal palace, Oradea|Baroque Palace]].

The city played a major role in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], being the home of the largest Hungarian arms factory.

At the end of [[World War I]] Oradea became a part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] under the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. The [[Second Vienna Award]] brokered by Hitler and Mussolini in 1940 allowed Hungary to recover [[Northern Transylvania]], including Oradea, where mass of celebrators welcomed the Hungarian administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhrf.org/erdelyinaplo/cikk_nyomtatas.php?id_cikk=10427 A nagyváradi „verőfényes magyar ünnep” (The "shiny Hungarian holiday" in Oradea), Erdélyi Napló, 4 February, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129131644/http://www.hhrf.org/erdelyinaplo/cikk_nyomtatas.php?id_cikk=10427 |date=29 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 1944, Oradea was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[2nd Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Battle of Debrecen]]. After World War II, Hungary had to relinquish claims to it under the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] concluded on 10 February 1947.

In 1925, the status of [[Municipalities of Romania|municipality]] was given to Oradea dissolving its former civic autonomy. Under the same ordinance, its name was changed from ''Oradea Mare'' ("Great" Oradea) to simply Oradea.

Ethnic tensions sometimes ran high in the area in the past but the different ethnic groups now generally live together in harmony, thriving on each other's contributions to modern culture.

After December 1989, Oradea aims to achieve greater prosperity along with other towns in Central Europe. Both culturally and economically, Oradea's prospects are inevitably tied to the general aspiration of Romanian society to [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]], democracy and a free [[market economy]], with varied initiatives in all fields of endeavor. Due to its specific character, Oradea is one of the most important economic and cultural centers of Western Romania and of the country in general, and one of the great academic centers, with a unique bilingual dynamic.

===Jewish community===
[[File:Sinagoga neologă Oradea - interior.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Interior of the Neolog Synagogue]]
:''This section incorporates text from the 1901–1906'' [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', a publication now in the [[public domain]].''

The ''[[chevra kadisha]]'' ("holy society") was founded in 1735, the first synagogue in 1803, and the first [[communal school]] in 1839. &lt;!--Update please: The old Jewish quarter, known as "''[[Katona Város]]''" (Soldier Town), is in the neighborhood of the fort. It still bears its ancient architecture and is still occupied mainly by Jews. The old synagogue remains, though no longer used for worship. The Jewish hospital also stands there.--&gt; Not until the beginning of the 19th century were Jews permitted to do business in any other part of the city, and even then they were required to return at nightfall to their own quarter. In 1835, permission was granted to live in any part of the city.

The Jewish community of Oradea [[Schism in Hungarian Jewry|became divided]] into [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregations]]. While the members of the Neolog congregation still retained their membership in the ''chevra kadisha'', they started to use a cemetery of their own in 1899. In the early 20th century, the Jews of Oradea had won prominence in the public life of the city. There were Jewish manufacturers, merchants, lawyers, physicians, and farmers; the chief of police (1902) was a Jew; and in the municipal council, the Jewish element was proportionately represented. The community possessed, in addition to the hospital and ''chevra kadisha'', a Jewish women's association, a [[grammar school]], a [[trade school]] for boys and girls, a [[yeshiva]], a [[soup kitchen]] etc.

According to the ''Center for Jewish Art'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Oradea Jewish community was once the most active both commercially and culturally in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1944, twenty-five thousand Oradean Jews were deported to concentration camps by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], thus decimating this vital community. Only three hundred Jews reside in Oradea today. In the center of the city, on the river bank and towering over other buildings in the area, is the large Neolog Temple Synagogue built in 1878. The unusual cube-shaped synagogue with its large cupola is one of the largest in Romania. Inside there is a large organ and stucco decorations. In 1891, the Orthodox community also built a complex of buildings including two synagogues and a community center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hum.huji.ac.il/CJA/NL14-Romania.htm |title=Uncovering and Documenting Jewish Art and Architecture in Western Romania |accessdate=2007-03-05 |date=Summer 1998 |work=Center for Jewish Art |publisher=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208145953/http://www.hum.huji.ac.il/cja/NL14-Romania.htm |archivedate=8 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1944, during the [[Operation Margarethe|occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany]], [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Hungarian authorities]] forced the Jewish inhabitants into the [[Oradea ghetto]] before sending them to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Descendants of the pre-[[Holocaust]] [[hasidic]] rabbinate in Oradea established a synagogue in the [[Willowbrook, Staten Island|Willowbrook]] area of [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]]. The synagogue maintains both a traditional hasidic [[Nusach Sefard]] and a [[Nusach Ashkenaz]] service, the latter of which operates under the name ''Bais Medrash Igud Avreichim of Groisverdain'' (the Yiddish pronunciation of Grosswardein).

==Quarters==
[[File:Oradea Districts EN.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the current 30 districts]]
Before 1848, Oradea was made up of 4 separate towns: Várad-Újváros (Villa Nova, former Vicus Szombathely), Várad-Olaszi (Villa Latinorum Varadiensium, "olasz" meaning Italian), Várad-Velence (Vicus Venetia), Várad-Váralja (Civitas Waradiensis). The names Vicus [[Venice|Venetia]], Villa [[Latium|Latinorum]], Vicus [[Bologna|Bolognia]], Vicus [[Padua]] and others refer to the French, [[Wallonia|Walloons]] and Italian inhabitants who settled in the 13th century.

Today the city is made up of the following districts called quarters (''cartiere'' in Romanian, ''negyedek'' in Hungarian):

==Economy==
Oradea has long been one of the more prosperous cities in Romania.  The per capita GDP of Oradea is approximately 150% of the Romanian average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmo.ro/movie.html Zona metropolitană Oradea – Prezentare multimedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304180020/http://www.zmo.ro/movie.html |date=4 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1989, due to its important base of consumers, Oradea enjoyed an economic renewal, not so much in industry but rather in the services sector such as trade and tourism.

&lt;!-- [[File:OradeaCity.750px.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Oradea]] City center ]] --&gt;
Oradea has an unemployment rate of 6.0%, slightly lower than the Romanian average but much higher than Bihor County's average of around 2%. Oradea currently produces around 63% of the industrial production of [[Bihor County]] while accounting for 34.5% of the population of the county. Its main industries are furniture, textiles and clothing, footwear and food processing.
Oradea economy is sustained largely by small and medium business and the property taxes paid by citizens.

In the fiscal year 2012, Oradea had the largest budget in the [[Transylvania]] region, overcoming its neighbour cities, [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Cluj-Napoca]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/locale/topul-bugetelor-locale-din-transilvania-si-banat-253725.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some large Romanian companies, such as Adeplast, RCS-RDS, European Drinks or FrigoExpress are located in Oradea.

==Transport==
[[File:ULF in Oradea.jpg|thumb|Oradea [[Ultra Low Floor]] tram]]
{{Main article|Transport in Oradea}}
The public transport network is run by OTL, a municipal agency. It is made up of three tram lines (1R, 1N, 2, 3R, 3N) and 17 local bus lines (numbered from 10 to 26), and an international suburban one to [[Biharkeresztes]], Hungary. The city has four train stations: Central, West, East and Episcopia Bihor (Bihor Abbey). The West Station is located in the quarter of Ioşia, the Central station (called simply Oradea) is located closer to the city center, near the quarter of Vie, while the East station is located in Velenţa.

Oradea is served by [[Oradea International Airport]], which has reopened at the end of 2015, after repairs to the runway.

==Education==
{{Peacock|section|date=March 2013}}
Oradea is one of the main education centers of Romania. The city is home to the [[University of Oradea]], one of the largest universities in the country. There are also several private universities, one being [[Agora University]], a modern academic institution founded in 2000. [[Emanuel University]], an accredited private Baptist university, also exists in the city since 2002.&lt;ref name="emanuel.ro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emanuel.ro/|title=Prima Pagina - Universitatea Emanuel din Oradea|author=|date=|website=Universitatea Emanuel din Oradea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditions of higher education in Oradea, metaphorically speaking, go back to time immemorial. This year 2012 there are 232 years since the inauguration of higher education in Oradea and 48 years of continuous higher education in Oradea.

At the end of the 18th century, "a higher institution for philosophic teaching" is founded in Oradea in 1780, which was to become in 1788 the Faculty of Law, the oldest [[faculty (division)|faculty]] not only within the Romanian borders but also in a vast region of Eastern Europe.

After 1921, all the courses at the Law Faculty were taught in Romanian. In 1923, the foundation of two theological academies gave new dimensions to the academic life in Oradea.

The Law Academy of Oradea, together with the two theological academies, was to make another step forward by integrating a faculty of letters, thus achieving the old desideratum of creating a University of Crisana in Oradea.

After a thirty-year break in the activity of the Law Academy of Oradea, on 1 October 1963, an order of the Ministry of Education established in Oradea a 3-year Pedagogic Institute meant to do away with the scarcity of teachers in secondary education. The new institution of higher education began its activity with two faculties: Philology and Mathematics-Physics, and a year later other two faculties (History-Geography and Physical Education) were added.

In May 1990, a decree of the Romanian Government established the Technical University of Oradea, later called the University of Oradea, and based on impressive traditions of academic life in the town. It was an act of scientific and cultural restoration long expected in the life of the Romanian society, a major gain of the people's Revolution of December 1989, one of the greatest Romanian achievements in [[Crisana]] after the Great Union on 1 December 1918. This is how the dream of several generations of scholars came true, clearly expressed by a historian of Oradea: "As regarding the future, the desire of all well-meant Romanians is to establish in Oradea a complete university, the lights of which will shine across the entire western border of Romania".
Today, the [[University of Oradea]] is an integrated institution of higher education of this kind, comprising 18 faculties.

The mission of the University of Oradea is to train and educate on a large scale both the students and also the high education graduates, as well as to approache certain domains of science and technology at high level.

[[File:Medicina Oradea.jpg|left|200px|thumb|The Faculty of Medicine]]
The structure of the University contains academic education, postgraduate education and scientific research.

The University of Oradea expanded itself by developing new faculties and research teams, as well as by developing certain specializations inside the existing faculties.

Inside the University of Oradea the education and research activity is developing in the area of natural and physical sciences, as well as in the area of social and human sciences, covering the following: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Sciences of Life, Agricultural Sciences, Medical Sciences, Technological Sciences, Economical Sciences, Geography, History, Juridical Sciences and Law, Linguistics, Pedagogy, Political Sciences, Psychology, Letters and Arts, Sociology, Philosophy. The educational process is based on the curricula for long undergraduate and postgraduate studies.

One of the oldest private universities in Romania is also situated in Oradea. The [[Sulyok István Reform College]] was founded in the spring of 1990 by the [[Királyhágómelléki Reform Church]]. In 1999 the school became entirely independent from the [[Protestant Theology College of Cluj-Napoca]] and changed its name to [http://www.partium.ro Partium Christian University]. It presently operates with 12 faculties and a student body of 1400; the language of instruction is Hungarian.

==Architecture==
[[File:Piata Ferdinand.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Ferdinand Square]]
[[File:Basilica romano-catolica.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Roman Catholic Basilica]]
[[File:Sinagoga Israelita Ortodoxa Oradea.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Orthodox Synagogue]]
Oradea's current architecture is a mix of Communist-era apartment buildings, mainly in the outer quarters, and beautiful historical buildings that are remnants of the era when the city was part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In addition to many [[Baroque]] buildings, Oradea is remarkable for its particularly rich collection of [[Art Nouveau]] architecture.

[[Art Nouveau]] is easy to discern because of its curved, undulating lines « flowing » naturally, in syncopate rhythms, as a musical leitmotif. The numerous open curved lines – parabolas and hyperbolas – important elements of [[Art Nouveau]] “panoply”, give dynamism and rhythm to these buildings and artefacts.

It is fully expressed in decorative arts, design and architecture. The main ornamental characteristic is the asymmetric undulating line, terminated by an energetic whiplash.

Oradea may be considered one of the most representative centres of 1900 architecture in [[Romania]]; it can be compared with those of Secession architecture in Central Europe.

Located at the Romanian western border, Oradea was, at the beginning of the 20th century, part of the Central European Austro-Hungarian Empire and, thus, was influenced by the artistic currents of this space.

The buildings of the early 20th century are richly marked by Lechner and [[Vienna]] Secession influence, inheriting an important legacy from the great architects of the artistic movement of the late 19th century and the early 20th century. The architecture and habitat of Oradea are to be approached only in the context of Central European architecture.

By its independence and personality, Oradea has a place among the large great European families of the firmly contoured 1900 Art, especially regarding the area between the Citadel and the Main Railway Station.  There are here rental buildings, (Moskovits Palace I and II, Apollo Palace, Stern Palace, Adorjan Houses I and II, Darvasy Palace), villas (La Roche, Vágó, Okany Schwartz), hôtels (Pannonia, Emke, Rimonoczy, Weiszlovics, Vulturul Negru), military buildings – on Armatei Române Street, industrial buildings and warehouses (beer-, spirit-, bricks-factories, electric plant’s chimney), public institutions (City Hall, Palace of Orthodox Bishopry, Palace of Greek-Catholic Bishopry, Palace of Justice, banks, houses of commerce and industry etc.), signed by architects who have a prime place in the European 1900 Architecture record: Odon Lechner, Dezső Jakab, Marcell Komor, László and József Vágó, Valér Mende, Ferenc Sztaril, Ferenc Löbl, Kálmán Rimanóczy Sr.and Jr., Anton Szallerbek.  All these sites offer a very diverse research and development material.
These great architects brought in Oradea the influence of Vienna and Budapest through their work, featuring a new style, different from the academic ones, thus creating the premises of a stylistic diversification based on inventions and originality.

[[File:Biserica Evanghelica Oradea.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Evangelical Church]]
Like many European cities, “Small Paris”, as Oradea was named at the beginning of the last century, has a belle-époque charm given by its Secession, eclectic, New-Romanian, Neoclassic and Baroque architecture. Not impressing by size or opulence, the buildings of Oradea have an aura of welfare, refinement and quality that imprints on the memory.
The early 20th century is well represented in the centre, but almost every zone of the city has something especially particular.
The [[historic|history]] centre of the city has a great historical, cultural, architectural and urban planning heritage value. It includes settlements nuclei, architectural relics, monuments of architecture and urban planning beginning with the 16th century up to a well represented beginning of the 20th century, and none of the monuments is annoying or discordant.

[[File:Palatul Baroc.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Baroque Palace]]
Analyzing the unity of style and ornamentation as an intrinsic value of Art Nouveau, we can find a coherent style combining the architectural structure and its artistic means; stucco mouldings, statues and medallions, ironwork, stained glass, opaque and coloured glass – they all justify ornamentation as a principle of architecture, based on the value of the line, on the organic power of the plant and on the structural symbol.
Oradea architecture is a result of the values created by an extremely interesting and valuable ethnic mix, which materialized in a value exchange of a rare richness, and in a shared heritage of great majesty and beauty. In its evident and rare specificity, it appears to be exceptionally valuable.
The heritage represents here a unifying element, a social cohesion instrument, which engendered a cultural mosaic and an original synthesis, like the dialects of a language – the result is a stylistic dialect resulting from mutual embellishments and fertilizations.

This contribution, a Romanian stylistic intervention in an important European current, is worth a special attention and a significant promotion, to match the quality, generosity, authenticity and exceptional value of the harmonious resulting interlacing.

The authenticity of the place was very well kept and fed by the previous generations. If the local specificity is not well-preserved, much of the cultural identity, so important in identifying a people, will be lost.
The entire community must feel obliged to a greater attention and sensitivity concerning the heritage protection, and the authorities and experts must develop policies and actions to preserve such a valuable heritage.
It is necessary to study and know the different views of conservation, to carefully choose the appropriate ones, in order to avoid possible pitfalls that may stem from trying to maintain a balance between conservation and management of the historic city.

'''Painting in the Americas before European colonization''' is the [[Precolumbian]] painting traditions of the Americas. Painting was a relatively widespread, popular and diverse means of communication and expression for both religious and utilitarian purpose throughout the regions of the [[Western Hemisphere]]. During the period before and after [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]] and settlement of the Americas; including [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and the islands of the [[Caribbean]], the [[Bahamas]], the [[West Indies]], the [[Antilles]], the [[Lesser Antilles]] and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced a wide variety of visual arts, including painting on textiles, hides, rock and cave surfaces, bodies especially faces, ceramics, architectural features including interior murals, wood panels, and other available surfaces. Many of the perishable surfaces, such as woven textiles, typically have not been preserved, but Precolumbian painting on ceramics, walls, and rocks have survived more frequently.

The oldest known paintings in the South America are the [[cave painting]]s of [[Caverna da Pedra Pintada]], in the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon rainforest]] that date back 11,200 years.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, John Noble. [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/23/science/scientist-at-work-anna-c-roosevelt-sharp-and-to-the-point-in-amazonia.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 Scientist at Work: Anna C. Roosevelt; Sharp and To the Point In Amazonia.] ''New York Times.'' 23 April 19of [[Caverna da Pedra Pintada]], in the [[Brazil96&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known painting in North America is the [[Cooper Bison Skull]] found near [[Fort Supply, Oklahoma]], dated to 10,200 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Bement, 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting in the Americas before colonization==
{{Main|Native American art|Maya art|Pre-Columbian art|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
Each continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on [[European art]] and vice versa during and after the [[Age of Exploration]]. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands and England were all powerful and influential [[colonial power]]s in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic.

===[[Mesoamerica]]===
{{see also|Mesoamerican writing systems|Oasisamerica|Aridoamerica|Aztec calendar stone}}
The murals of [[Teotihuacan]] that adorn the archaeological site (and others, like the [[Wagner Murals]], found in private collections) and from hieroglyphic inscriptions made by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] describing their encounters with Teotihuacano conquerors are the source of most of what is understood about that ancient civilization.  The painting of the murals, perhaps thousands of them, reached its zenith between 450 and 650 CE.  The painters' artistry was unrivalled in Mesoamerica and has been compared with that of [[Florence, Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Great Goddess====
A series of [[mural]]s were found in the Tepantitla compound in Teotihuacan. In 1942, archaeologist [[Alfonso Caso]] identified the central figures as a Teotihuacan equivalent of ''[[Tlaloc]],'' the Mesoamerican god of rain and warfare.  During the 1970s researcher Esther Pasztory re-examined the murals and concluded that many paintings of "Tlaloc" instead showed a ''feminine'' deity, an analysis based on a number of factors including the gender of accompanying figures, the green bird in the headdress, and the spiders seen above the figure.&lt;ref&gt;Pasztory (1977, pp.83–85).&lt;/ref&gt;  Pasztory concluded that the figures represented a vegetation and fertility goddess that was a predecessor of the much later Aztec goddess [[Xochiquetzal]].

The Great Goddess has since been identified at locations other than Tepantitla – including Teotihuacan's Tetitla compound, the Palace of the Jaguars, and the Temple of Agriculture – as well as on several vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Pasztory (1977, pp.87–91).&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Temple of the Murals====
{{see also|San Bartolo (Maya site)}}
Large painted [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[mural]]s were found in the archaeological site [[Bonampak]], in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of [[Chiapas]] near the border with [[Guatemala]]. What is referred to as ''The Temple of the Murals'' is a long narrow building with 3 rooms atop a low-stepped pyramid base. The interior walls preserve the finest examples of classic Maya painting. Huge paintings cover the walls of one of the structure's three rooms. The paintings show the story of a single battle and its victorious outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Michael D. (1999).

====Nazca culture====
The [[Nazca culture]] of [[Peru]] produced painted pottery and painted ceramics depicting religious and symbolic characters as well as imagery of personages within the culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/d/double_spout_and_bridge_vessel.aspx] On Nazca ceramics retrieved May 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They produced in addition to ceramics, highly complex textiles and [[Geoglyph]]s. The period from 1-700 A.D is generally considered when this group thrived. Modern knowledge about the culture of the Nazca is built upon the study of [[Cahuachi]] the ceremonial center from (1-500 AD).

In the area that is now the United States, many different and diverse [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of people created painting and ornamental painted objects of a large variety. The oldest known example is the [[Cooper Bison Kill Site|Cooper Bison skull]], which was painted with a red zigzag circa 10,200 BCE in present-day [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Bement, Leland C. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hfTR4jiAe64C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Leland%20Bement&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Bison hunting at Cooper site: where lightning bolts drew thundering herds.''] Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3053-8}}. Pages 37, 176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Body painting]], [[rock art]], [[hide painting]] flourished in ancient North America, as well as painting on ceramics, textiles, and other surfaces.

[[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] ([[Anasazi]]) of the American Southwest have a longstanding tradition of painting interior murals and ceramics, as did the [[Mogollon culture]], ancestors of [[Zuni people|Zuni]] and [[Hopi]] tribes, who lived in an area near the [[Gila Wilderness]]. The [[Fremont culture]] of [[Utah]] are known for their abundant rock paintings throughout [[Utah]], particularly those at [[Range Creek|Range Creek Canyon]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Ellen Sue. [http://www.staa.org/fremont/FREMONT.html "The Fremont People of Range Creek Canyon, Utah."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425164346/http://www.staa.org/fremont/FREMONT.html |date=2010-04-25 }} ''Southern Texas Archeological Association.'' 2004 (retrieved 9 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Patayan]] typically painted ceramics with a red slip. The [[Hohokam]], ancestors of the [[Akimel O'odham]] and [[Tohono O'odham]], are known for their red-on-buff painted ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/artifacts/gilapottery.html "Gila Pottery."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530105248/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/artifacts/gilapottery.html |date=2010-05-30 }} ''E-Museum of the Minnesota State University, Mankato.'' (retrieved 9 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument]] is the best known monument of [[Hohokam]] culture.

[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#California|Native Americans in California]] created many pieces and environments of [[rock art]]. The most elaborate and artistic painted [[pictograph]]s being the [[Rock art of the Chumash people]], and [[petroglyph]]s those of the [[Coso people]] in the [[Coso Rock Art District]].&lt;ref&gt;Penney, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[Northwest Coast art]] features formline painting on woven items and wood; however, few of these items survived the centuries the [[temperate rainforest]] climate.

'''Pashko Vasa''' (1825, [[Shkodër]], [[Albania]], [[Ottoman Empire]] &amp;ndash; June 29, 1892, [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], Ottoman Empire), also known as '''Vaso Pasha''', '''Wasa Pasha''' or '''Vaso Pashë Shkodrani''', was an Albanian writer, poet and publicist of the [[Albanian National Awakening]], and [[History of Lebanon under Ottoman rule|Governor of Lebanon]] from 1882 until his death.

==Biography==
Pashko Vasa was from Shkodër and a Catholic Albanian who held high positions within the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Skendi57"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=57.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych57"/&gt;

===Secretary in the British Consulate===
From 1842 to 1847 he worked as a secretary for the [[British Empire|British]] consulate in [[Shkodër]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych57"/&gt; He there had the opportunity to perfect his knowledge of a number of foreign languages: [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. He also knew some English and [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and in later years learned [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kopeček |first=Michal |title= Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770&amp;ndash;1945)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TpPWvubBL0MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Discourses+of+collective+identity+in+Central+and+Southeast+Europe&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kN81TfOzO8ej8QOBoqy9BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |edition= |series= |volume= 2|date= |origyear= |year= |month= |publisher=Central European University Press |location=Budapest, Hungary |language= |isbn= 963-7326-60-X |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page= 119 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= Italian, French, English, Serbian, Arabic and, of course, Turkish |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1847-1848: The Italian Year===
In 1847, he set off for Italy on the eve of turbulent events that were to take place there and elsewhere in Europe in 1848. There are two letters written by him in [[Bologna]] in the summer of 1848 in which he expresses openly republican and anti-clerical views. He later went to [[Venice]] where he took part in [[Battle of Mestre|fighting in Marghera]] in October 1848, part of a [[Venice|Venetian]] uprising against the Austrians. After the arrival of Austrian troops, Pashko Vasa was obliged to flee to [[Ancona]] where, as an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] citizen, he was expelled to [[Istanbul]].

He published an account of his experience in Italy the following year in Italian-language ''La mia prigionia, episodio storico dell'assedio di Venezia'', Istanbul 1850 (My imprisonment, historical episode from the siege of Venice).&lt;ref name="Gawrych57"/&gt;

===1848-1863: In Istanbul===
In Istanbul, after an initial period of poverty and hardship, he obtained a position at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,&lt;ref name="Gawrych57"/&gt; whence he was seconded to London for a time, to the Imperial Ottoman Embassy to the [[Court of St. James's]]. He later served the [[Sublime Porte]] in various positions of authority as a bureaucrat.&lt;ref name="Gawrych57"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=57.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1863-1864: In Bosnia-Herzegovina===
In 1863, thanks to his knowledge of Serbian, he was appointed to serve as a secretary and interpreter to [[Ahmet Cevdet Pasha]], Ottoman statesman and historian, on a fact-finding mission to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] which lasted for twenty months, from the spring of 1863 to October 1864. The events of this mission were recorded in his ''La Bosnie et l'Herzégovine pendant la mission de Djevdet Efendi'', Constantinople 1865 (Bosnia and Herzegovina during the mission of Jevdet Efendi).

A few years later he published another now rare work of historical interest, ''Esquisse historique sur le Monténégro d'après les traditions de l'Albanie'', Constantinople 1872 (Historical sketch of Montenegro according to Albanian traditions).

===Administrator of Edirne vilayet===
[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|right|Vasa (centre, between the counsel for the prisoner and Pertev Effendi) at an Ottoman trial, 1877]]
In 1879, Pashko Vasa worked in [[Varna]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast in the administration of the [[vilayet of Edirne]] with [[Ismail Qemali]]. He also acquired the title of [[Pasha]].&lt;ref name="Elsie2012"/&gt;

===Importance to Albania===

Despite his functions on behalf of the Porte, Pashko Vasa never forgot his Albanian homeland. In the autumn of 1877 he became a founding member of the [[Central Committee for the Defence of the Rights of the Albanian People]] in Istanbul which was a group of Albanian intelligentsia advocating for the territorial integrity and unity of Albanian inhabited areas in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Gawrych44"/&gt; As a member of the Committee he met during mid March with British ambassador [[Austen Henry Layard]] in Istanbul and urged that Albanian inhabited territories not be given to newly independent Slavic states.&lt;ref name="Gawrych44"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=44.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his contacts at the Committee, he also participated in the organization of the [[League of Prizren]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="Skendi9091170"/&gt; He was probably the author of the Memorandum on Albanian Autonomy which had his signature alongside those of other Albanian notables and the document was submitted to the British Embassy in Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Elsie2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&amp;pg=PA460|date=24 December 2012|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78076-431-3|pages=459–461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych4748"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=47-48.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasa favoured the unification of Albanian inhabited vilayets or provinces into a single vilayet of Albania within the Ottoman empire and having a "compact and strong organisation" with Albanian participation in its public administration.&lt;ref name="Skendi9091170"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=90-91,170.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creation of the Albanian alphabet====
Vasa as a member of the Committee for Defending Albanian Rights was appointed along with [[Sami Frashëri]], [[Jani Vreto]] and [[Hasan Tahsini]] to create an [[Albanian alphabet]] which by 19 March 1879 the group approved Frashëri's 36 letter alphabet consisting mostly of Latin characters.&lt;ref name="Gawrych59"/&gt;&lt;ref name=book&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IJ2s9sQ9bGkC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=koto+hoxhi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YIKMQffSFK&amp;sig=7ALCDYVOY2NbBdfDwChP2UWbD6w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EBS7S7vKCIS80gTEzOj9Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=koto%20hoxhi&amp;f=false The Albanians: an ethnic history from prehistoric times to the present], Edwin E.

===Governor of Lebanon===
[[File:Pashko Vasa.jpg|thumb|right|Photo from the 1880s]] 

Sultan Abdulhamid II appointed Vasa as Governor General ([[Mutasarrıf|Mutessarıf]]) of [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate|Mount Lebanon]] on June 18, 1882, a post reserved by [[Règlement Organique (Lebanon)|international treaty]] for a Catholic of Ottoman nationality after the civil unrest and French occupation of 1860.&lt;ref name="Gawrych8586"/&gt; While in Lebanon as governor, Vasa continued his work for [[Albanianism]] by publishing books on Albania in French and other publications on the Albanian language.&lt;ref name="Gawrych8586"/&gt; In his post as Mutassarıf, he was initially more willing to accept French consular authority, but over his nine years in office, he came to distrust both the French Consul and the Maronite Clergy, who closely guarded their privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akarlı|first=Engin|title=The Long Peace: Ottoman Lebanon 1861-1920|year=1993|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This earned him accusations of corruption, in association with his son-in-law and deputy Kupelyan Effendi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akarlı|first=Engin|title=The Long Peace|year=1993|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=Chapter 7, footnote 1|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6199p06t&amp;chunk.id=nsd0e4741&amp;toc.id=d0e75&amp;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, he remained in office until his death in [[Beirut]] after a long illness on June 29, 1892.&lt;ref name="Gawrych8586"/&gt; 

In 1978, the centenary of the League of Prizren, his remains were transferred from the Lebanon back to a modest grave in Shkodra.

==Literary works==

During 1879 ''The Truth on Albania and Albanians'' was a book published by Vasa and appeared in French, English, German, Greek and Albanian translations that advocated for the Albanian cause and to inform a European readership about Albanians.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; In 1880 the book with a shortened title ''Albania and Albanians'' also appeared in Ottoman Turkish.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; The book discussed the origins of Albanians, who they were and their living conditions while arguing that they were the oldest people in the Balkans and separate from the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; Vasa glorified medieval era Albanian resistance for independence and freedom to the Ottomans under [[Skanderbeg]] while celebrating Albanian military prowess as a natural fighters and ability to defend the empire.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; He also mentioned that after those events Albanians were an integral and loyal part of the empire having contributed many statesmen, bureaucrats, commanders and soldiers.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; His book criticised Ottoman governance in Albania of sending non-Albanian Ottoman officials to administer Albanians who were ineffective as they were unfamiliar with the local language, customs and other societal factors.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; Vasa suggested indirectly that either local Albanians could be appointed or Ottoman officials trained in the local ways of the Albanians as a solution to those issues.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; He attempted to impress on readers the unity of Albanians as a people with a common language, customs, history and aspirations while sidelining religious divisions and differences between the areas of Gegalik (Gegënia) and Toskalik (Toskëria).&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; Vasa also advocated for the unification of various vilayets with Albanian populations into one administrative unit claiming that it would assist Ottoman interests as Muslim Albanians had no desire to revolt against the empire.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; The political Albanianism of the book overall was a response to geopolitical threats posed to Albanian inhabited territories within the empire and issues relating to the notion of rights regarding nationality for Albanians.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"/&gt; Various outlets of the European press like ''[[The London Times|The (London) Times]]'' reviewed his book and explained its contents, themes and other details about Albania and Albanians to their readership.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5759"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=57-59.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the Albanian language better known and to give other Europeans an opportunity to learn it, he published a ''Grammaire albanaise à l'usage de ceux qui désirent apprendre cette langue sans l'aide d'un maître'', [[Ludgate Hill]] 1887 (Albanian grammar&lt;ref name="Gawrych8586"/&gt; for those wishing to learn this language without the aid of a teacher), one of the rare grammars of the period. Pashko Vasa was also the author of a number of literary works of note. The first of these is a volume of Italian verse entitled ''Rose e spine'', Constantinople 1873 (Roses and thorns), forty-one emotionally charged poems (a total of ca. 1,600 lines) devoted to themes of love, suffering, solitude and death in the traditions of the romantic verse of his European predecessors [[Giacomo Leopardi]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and [[Alfred de Musset]]. Among the subjects treated in these meditative Italian poems, two of which are dedicated to the Italian poets [[Francesco Petrarch]] and [[Torquato Tasso]], are life in exile and family tragedy, a reflection of Pashko Vasa's own personal life. His first wife, Drande, whom he had married in 1855, and four of their five children died before him, and in later years too, personal misfortune continued to haunt him.&lt;ref name="Elsie2012"/&gt;

In 1884, shortly after his appointment as Governor General of the Lebanon, his second wife from Shkodër, Katerina Bonati, died of tuberculosis, as did his surviving daughter Roza in 1887. ''Bardha de Témal, scènes de la vie albanaise'', Paris 1890 (Bardha of Temal, scenes from Albanian life), is a French-language novel which Pashko Vasa published in Paris under the pseudonym of [[Albanus Albano]]&lt;ref name="Gawrych8586"/&gt; the same year as [[Naim Frashëri]]'s noted verse collection ''Lulet e verës'' (The Flowers of Spring) appeared in [[Bucharest]]. 'Bardha of Temal,' though not written in Albanian, is, after Sami Frashëri's much shorter prose work 'Love of Tal'at and Fitnat,' the oldest novel written and published by an Albanian and is certainly the oldest such novel with an Albanian theme. Focusing on the habits and customs of Gheg Albanians in Northern Albania&lt;ref name="Gawrych8586"/&gt; the novel set in Shkodra during 1842, is classically structured roman-feuilleton, rather excessively sentimental for modern tastes and follows the tribulations of the fair but married Bardha and her lover, the young Aradi. It was written not only as an entertaining love story but also with a view to informing the western reader of the customs and habits of the northern Albanians. Bardha is no doubt the personification of Albania itself, married off against her will to the powers that be. Above and beyond its didactic character and any possible literary pretensions the author might have had, 'Bardha of Temal' also has a more specific political background. It was interpreted by some Albanian intellectuals at the time as a vehicle for discrediting the Gjonmarkaj clan who, in cahoots with the powerful abbots of [[Mirdita]], held sway in the Shkodra region. It is for this reason perhaps that Pashko Vasa published the novel under the pseudonym Albanus Albano. The work is not known to have had any particular echo in the French press of the period.&lt;ref name="Elsie2012"/&gt;

Though most of Pashko Vasa's publications were in French and Italian, there is one poem, the most influential and perhaps the most popular ever written in Albanian, which has ensured him his deserved place in Albanian literary history, the famous ''[[O moj Shqypni|O moj Shqypni e mjera Shqypni]]'' (Oh Albania, Poor Albania).&lt;ref name="Skendi169170"/&gt; Frustrated by Albanian societal divisions, this stirring appeal by Vasa for a national awakening and unity transcending religious and other identities is thought to have been written in the period between 1878, the dramatic year of the [[League of Prizren]], and 1880.&lt;ref name="Elsie2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi169170"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&amp;ots=zGjQbVyql8&amp;sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Vasa%20&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=169-170.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych6970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gawrych|first=George|title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874–1913|year=2006|location=London|publisher=IB Tauris|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT94zl8ebXAhWJT7wKHYRLADEQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Vasa&amp;f=false|isbn=9781845112875|pages=69-70.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasa overall continued to inform European readers on Albanians and Albania through his French publications, as he had done from the time of the Unionist Societies.&lt;ref name="Gawrych8586"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=85-86.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pieter Hendrik van Cittert''' (30 May 1889, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]] – 8 October 1959, [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]) was a Dutch physicist and science historian. He was born in [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], Netherlands, to Benjamin Pieter van Cittert and Petronella Antonia Huber, and died on October 8, 1959, in [[Utrecht]]. His achievements include proving the [[Van Cittert–Zernike theorem]] about the coherence of radiation and founding the University Museum in Utrecht.

==Career==
In 1912, Hendrik van Cittert joined the Physics Laboratory at the [[University of Utrecht]]. In 1918, he discovered thousands of historical scientific instruments from the eighteenth-century Physics Society in [[Utrecht]]. This collection was the starting point for the University Museum, which Hendrik van Cittert founded in 1928. He was promoted in 1919. In 1921, Hendrik van Cittert and [[Leonard Ornstein]] were among the founders of the Dutch Physical Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnv.nl/]&lt;/ref&gt; (NNV). Hendrik van Cittert was a part-time teacher of physics at HOBS in Utrecht (1916–1950). He founded the Physics Laboratory in Utrecht (1922–1950) and became the first director&lt;ref&gt;Cabinets of Experimental Philosophy in Eighteenth-Century Europe. Edited by Jim Bennett &amp; Sofia Talas. Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands, 2013. ISSN 1872-0684.&lt;/ref&gt; of the University Museum of Utrecht (1951–1955).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30121">{{Periods in US history}}
The '''Reagan Era''' or '''Age of Reagan''' is a periodization of recent [[History of the United States|American history]] used by historians and political observers to emphasize that the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] "Reagan Revolution" led by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[Domestic policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|domestic]] and [[Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|foreign policy]] had a lasting impact. It overlaps with what political scientists call the [[Sixth Party System]]. Definitions of the Reagan Era universally include the 1980s, while more extensive definitions may also include the late 1970s, the 1990s, the 2000s (decade), and even the 2010s. In his 2008 book, ''The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974–2008'', historian and journalist [[Sean Wilentz]] argues that Reagan dominated this stretch of American history in the same way that [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his [[New Deal]] legacy dominated the four decades that preceded it.

The Reagan Era included ideas and personalities beyond Reagan himself; he is usually characterized as the leader of a broadly based conservative movement whose ideas dominated national policy making in areas such as taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary, and the [[Cold War]]. Other major conservative figures and organizations of the Reagan era include [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Phyllis Schlafly]], [[Newt Gingrich]], and [[The Heritage Foundation]]. The [[Rehnquist Court]], which was inaugurated during Reagan's presidency, handed down several conservative decisions. The Reagan era coincides with the presidency of Reagan, and, in more extensive definitions, the presidencies of [[Gerald Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and possibly [[Barack Obama]] and [[Donald Trump]]. [[Modern liberalism in the United States|Liberals]] generally lament the Reagan Era, while [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] generally praise it and call for its continuation in the 21st century. 

Upon taking office, the Reagan administration implemented an economic policy based on the theory of [[supply-side economics]]. Taxes were reduced through the passage of the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]], while the administration also cut domestic spending and increased military spending. Increasing deficits motivated the passage of tax increases during the George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations, but taxes were cut again with the passage of the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]]. During Clinton's presidency, Republicans won passage of the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]], a bill which placed several new limits on those receiving [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal assistance]].

Campaigning for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination in 2008, Barack Obama interpreted how Reagan changed the nation's trajectory:

{{blockquote|I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. I think they felt like with all the excesses of the 1960s and 1970s and government had grown and grown but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating. I think that people... he just tapped into what people were already feeling, which was we want clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in  [https://www.nytimes.com/ref/us/politics/21seelye-text.html "In Their Own Words: Obama on Reagan," ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Dates==
Most historians begin the era in 1980, when Reagan was elected president, and usually probe back into the 1970s for the origins of the Reagan Era. For example, Kalman (2010) explores multiple crises of the 1970s that eroded confidence in liberal solutions: the rise of the religious right and the reaction against the [[gay rights movement]], [[feminism]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]], [[grassroots]] reactions against busing ordered by federal judges, the defeat in Vietnam, the collapse of détente and fears of Soviet power, the challenge of imported cars and textiles, the [[deindustrialization]] of the [[Rust Belt]], soaring inflation, [[stagflation]], and the energy crisis, as well as the humiliation the nation suffered during the [[Iran hostage crisis]] and the sense of malaise as the nation wondered if its glory days had passed. She shows step by step the process by which one political alternative after another collapsed, leaving Reagan standing.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Kalman, ''Right Star Rising: A New Politics, 1974–1980'' (Norton, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Reagan Era" is often used to refer to the United States only during Reagan's presidency, but it has also taken on an extended meaning that incorporates other periods. The [[presidency of George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush presidency]] (1989–1993), the [[presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton presidency]] (1993–2001), and the [[presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush presidency]] (2001–2009) are often treated as extensions of the Reagan Era.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Godwin, ''Clintonomics: How Bill Clinton Reengineered the Reagan Revolution'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilentz additionally includes the [[presidency of Gerald Ford|Ford presidency]] (1974–1977) and the [[presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter presidency]] (1977–1981).&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The endpoint of the Reagan Era is often seen as the election of Democrat [[Barack Obama]] in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]].&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth White, ''Barack Obama's America: How New Conceptions of Race, Family, and Religion Ended the Reagan Era'' (2009); Marjorie Williams and Timothy Noah, ''Reputation: portraits in power'' (2008)  Page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; Midterm elections in [[United States elections, 2010|2010]] and [[United States elections, 2014|2014]] seemed to cast doubt on a true end of the Reagan Era as conservative Republicans claimed two major victories claiming both the House and later the Senate.  However, the sweeping policies pursued by the Obama Administration constituted a clear break with Reagan Era economics and social issues, as Americans became more supportive of social issues like gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana as well as showing more support for government involvement in [[Obamacare|healthcare]] and [[education]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election victory]] of President [[Donald Trump]] has stirred debate over whether his rise signifies the continuation of the Reagan Era or represents a paradigm shift for American politics. Political scientist [[Stephen Skowronek]] argues that Trump's election shows that the Reagan era continues. Skowronek compares Obama to former presidents like [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], who governed at a time when their own party was generally in the minority at the federal level.&lt;ref name="rkreitner1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kreitner|first1=Richard|title=What Time Is It?

Wilentz traces the start of the Reagan era to the [[Watergate scandal]], which ended the [[presidency of Richard Nixon|presidency]] of [[Richard Nixon]] and created an opening for a new Republican leader.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Watergate scandal, the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], the [[Vietnam War]], and poor economic conditions created widespread public alienation from political leaders in the mid-1970s. A mass movement of population from the cities to the suburbs led to the creation of a new group of voters less attached to [[New Deal]] economic policies and [[political machine|machine politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan and other conservatives successfully presented conservative ideas as an alternative to a public that had grown disillusioned with [[New Deal]] liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan's charisma and speaking skills helped him frame conservatism as an optimistic, forward-looking vision for the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan challenged Nixon's successor, incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]], in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Republican presidential primaries]]. Ford defeated Reagan to win the presidential nomination at the [[1976 Republican National Convention]], but he lost in the general election to the Democratic nominee, [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 64–72&lt;/ref&gt;

During his presidency, Carter alienated many of those who had voted for him in 1976, including many in his own party. In the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Democratic primaries]], Carter defeated a strong challenge from the left in the form of Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], who had clashed with Carter over the establishment of a [[national health insurance]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 84, 116–121&lt;/ref&gt; Carter, and the Democratic Party as a whole, also alienated other voters, while the conservative movement gathered strength. A continually poor economy bred frustration over taxes, and voters became increasingly receptive to those advocating for a smaller government. A backlash also developed against [[affirmative action]] programs, as some whites claimed that the programs constituted [[reverse discrimination]]. The president had won a majority of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Protestant]] voters in 1976, but the increasingly-politicized [[Christian right]] came to strongly oppose his presidency. Many of these religious voters were swayed by the public campaigns of leaders such as [[Jerry Falwell]] of the [[Moral Majority]] and [[Phyllis Schlafly]], who opposed ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. Another important conservative organization, [[The Heritage Foundation]], emerged as an important conservative [[think tank]] that developed and advocated conservative policies.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 83–93&lt;/ref&gt;

With the backing of many in the conservative movement, Reagan defeated establishment favorite [[George H. W. Bush]], moderate Congressman [[John B. Anderson]], and others in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Republican primaries]]. To ensure party unity, Reagan named Bush as his running mate at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]], even though Bush had characterized Reagan's [[supply-side economics]] as "voodoo economics". Reagan mobilized his [[base (politics)|base]] by campaigning on his conservative positions, while the Carter campaign sought to portray Reagan as a dangerous extremist. An improving economy helped Carter overtake Reagan in the October polling, but Reagan won a decisive victory in an October 28 debate. On election day, Reagan narrowly won a majority in the popular vote but took the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] by a wide margin, carrying 44 states. In the concurrent [[United States elections, 1980|congressional elections]], Republicans won several seats in the House of Representatives and took control of the Senate for the first time since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 120–125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reagan's presidency==
{{Main|Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reaganomics}}
[[File:President Reagan speaking in Minneapolis 1982.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Reagan in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], 1982]]
Upon taking office, Reagan argued that the United States faced a dire crisis, and that the best way to address this crisis was through conservative reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 127–129&lt;/ref&gt; His major policy priorities were increasing military spending, cutting taxes, reducing federal spending, and restricting federal regulations. Reagan believed that reducing the role of the government would lead to increased economic growth, which in turn would lead to higher revenues that would help pay down the national debt. Working with Congressman [[Jack Kemp]], the Reagan administration introduced a major tax cut bill  that won the support of enough Republicans and conservative Democrats to pass both houses of Congress. In August 1981, Reagan signed the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]], which enacted a 27% across-the-board federal income tax cut over three years, as well as a separate bill that reduced federal spending, especially in anti-poverty programs.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 139–144&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Early 1980s recession|recession]] in the early part of Reagan's term, combined with tax cuts and increased military spending, led to an increasing deficit. Democrats won several seats in the House of Representatives in the [[United States elections, 1982|1982 mid-term elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan's approval ratings fell to 35%, and many Democrats believed that their party could defeat Reagan in the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]] and roll back some of the Reagan administration policies.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; A strong economic recovery began in 1983 boosted Reagan's approval ratings, and the administration argued that the tax cuts had been the primary factor in turning the economy around. In the 1984 presidential election, Reagan won his party's re-nomination without facing a serious challenge, while former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] won the Democratic nomination. On election day, Reagan won 59% of the popular vote and carried 49 states, leading to speculation of a [[Realigning election|permanent realignment]] in U.S. politics towards the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 170–175&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his re-election, Reagan faced significantly more difficulties in enacting conservative policies in his second term. His domestic agenda was hindered by growing deficits and the fallout of the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. However, the administration did win a significant foreign policy success when Reagan and Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] reached the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] INF Treaty in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan also appointed numerous conservative judges, including Associate Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[William Rehnquist]], who Reagan elevated to the position of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]]. The [[Rehnquist Court]] would hand down several conservative decisions in ensuing years.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 187–189&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President Bush defeated Senator [[Bob Dole]] and televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] to win the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1988|1988 Republican primaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 264–266&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by Reagan's renewed popularity, Bush defeated [[Michael Dukakis]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 269–273&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reagan's successors==
{{see also|Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Presidency of Bill Clinton|Presidency of George W. Bush}}
[[File:North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Kickoff 01.jpg|thumb|left|300px|George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton]]
Bush's presidency focused largely on foreign affairs, and he faced a series of major foreign policy issues as the [[Eastern Bloc]] collapsed. Many of Bush's top foreign policy appointments, including National Security Adviser [[Brent Scowcroft]], were [[Realism (international relations)|realists]] who were influenced by [[Henry Kissinger]]. While the [[Berlin Wall]] fell and other Soviet-aligned countries experienced turmoil, Bush pursued friendly relations with Gorbachev, which played a part in the Soviet Union's assent to the [[German reunification|reunification]] of [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 290–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush launched a successful invasion of [[Panama]] in 1989 and led a multinational coalition against [[Iraq]] in the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. After the quick U.S. victory in the Gulf War, Bush's approval ratings soared.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 293–294, 297–303&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bush administration found less success in domestic policy, where deficits continued to be a major issue. Though Bush had [[Read my lips: no new taxes|promised not to raise taxes]] at the 1988 Republican National Convention, his hand was forced in part by the [[Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act]], a 1985 law that purportedly required a balanced budget by 1993. After a long battle with the Democratic Congress, Bush agreed to sign the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]], which contained a mix of tax increases and spending cuts. Conservative Republicans, who had never fully accepted Bush despite his move towards the right during the 1980s, were outraged by the deal.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 288–289, 307–310.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adding to the administration's challenges, the country entered a [[Early 1990s recession in the United States|recession]] in 1990, with the national unemployment rate rising to 7.8%.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 did not greatly help Bush, as many conservatives credited Reagan's policies for the collapse of the U.S. long-time rival.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 313–314.&lt;/ref&gt; Bush won his party's re-nomination after defeating a challenge from right-wing commentator and former Reagan official [[Pat Buchanan]] in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1992|1992 Republican presidential primaries]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1992|general election]], Bush faced Democratic Governor [[Bill Clinton]] and an independent candidate, [[Ross Perot]]. Perot ran a [[populism|populist]] campaign that focused on opposition the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and Bush's failure to balance the budget.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 316–317.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton, a founding member of the centrist [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), focused on the poor economic conditions. In the three-way race, Clinton won a majority of the electoral vote and took 43% of the popular vote, while Bush 37.4% of the popular vote and Perot took 18.9%.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 318–322&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton's victory made him the first Democratic president since Jimmy Carter left office in 1981, and he began his term with a Democratic Congress. Though Clinton won early legislative victories such as passage of the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] and the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]], his administration was damaged by a series of minor scandals and the failure of his [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care reform proposal]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 326–336, 341–346&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States elections, 1994|1994 mid-term elections]], Republicans took control of both houses of Congress. In response, Clinton hired political consultant [[Dick Morris]], who advocated a strategy of [[Triangulation (politics)|Triangulation]] between the Republican and Democratic members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 350–351&lt;/ref&gt; In a major budget stand-off that involved two [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995–1996|government shutdowns]], Clinton won congressional approval of his own budget proposal, which avoided the deep cuts [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and other programs that had been sought by Speaker of the House [[Newt Gingrich]] and other congressional Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 357–364&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Clinton signed the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]], a Republican-authored bill which placed several new limits on those receiving [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal assistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 364–367&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinton had called for a reform of the welfare system during his 1992 campaign, wanting to add changes such as work requirements for recipients.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], Clinton defeated Republican nominee Bob Dole by a wide margin in both the popular vote and the electoral vote. As Republicans retained control of Congress, he was unable to advance much of his domestic agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 370–371&lt;/ref&gt; Economic growth was especially strong during Clinton's second term, and the unemployment dropped to 4% in 2000. In 1998, the government experienced its first budget surplus since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 371–372&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Clinton's second term was dominated by [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment proceedings against Clinton]], which stemmed from his affair with White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 382–398&lt;/ref&gt; Though the House voted to impeach Clinton, he was acquitted by the Senate, as all Senate Democrats and several Senate Republicans voted not guilty on both impeachment charges.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 398–400&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the strong economy, Clinton's Vice President, [[Al Gore]], most Washington pundits regarded Gore as the early favorite in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 413–414&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an extremely close and contested election that ended in a [[Bush v. Gore|controversial Supreme Court decision]], Governor [[George W. Bush]] of Texas, the son of former President Bush, defeated Gore.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 418–429&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's administration included many prominent figures from previous Republican administrations, including [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[Dick Cheney]], and [[Colin Powell]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 437–438&lt;/ref&gt; Upon taking office, Bush signed a major tax cut, the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 437–438&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks]], the Bush administration launched the [[Afghanistan War]] and the [[War on Terror]], a global conflict against [[al-Qaeda]] and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 440–442&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the administration launched the [[Iraq War]], which deposed Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]]. Despite the growing unpopularity of the [[Iraq War]], Bush defeated Democrat [[John Kerry]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 443–444&lt;/ref&gt; In the two years after Bush's re-election, the [[Jack Abramoff scandals]], the administration's handling of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Bush's failed attempt to reform Social Security, and the Iraq War's continued unpopularity all weakened Bush's public standing.&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 446–447&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by Bush's popularity and the [[Mark Foley scandal]], Democrats won control of Congress in the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, pp. 449–450&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a collapse in housing prices led to a [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|major financial crisis]], which marked the start of a prolonged economic downturn known as the [[Great Recession]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], held in the midst of the financial crisis, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]].

==Popular culture==
[[File:Szabadság Square, statue of Ronald Reagan.jpg|thumb|Statue of President Reagan in Budapest]]
[[Tom Clancy]] wrote three best-selling novels that illuminate the Reagan era: ''The Hunt for Red October'' (1984), ''Red Storm Rising'' (1986), and ''The Cardinal of the Kremlin'' (1988). They reflect Reagan-era Cold War values. The Soviet Union as an [[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]] and the superiority of American values and technology are all themes both of Clancy's thrillers and Reagan's rhetoric. Policy elites used these novels (and the filming of one of them) to promote their ideas of national security to the American public.&lt;ref&gt;Walter L. Hixson, "'Red Storm Rising': Tom Clancy novels and the cult of national security," ''Diplomatic History,'' Fall 1993, Vol. 17 Issue 4, pp 599–613&lt;/ref&gt; Kendrick Lamar has a song titled ''Ronald Reagan Era'' off of his 2011 Album, Section.80.

Reagan appears as a character in the comic books [[The Dark Knight Returns]] (1986) and [[Legends (comics)|Legends]] (1986-87).

==International==
Many scholars take an international perspective, linking the Reagan Era with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Era]] in Britain. As a socialist scholar explained,
:Throughout many of the capitalist democracies in Western Europe and in North America, the recession that began with the sharp rise in petroleum prices in 1973–74 signaled an epochal shift in the patchwork of growth- based economic and social policies....The demise of Keynesianism which followed meant far more than the obsolescence of an economic doctrine that had been used to justify a broad range of economic policies. It represented a significant retreat from a vision of society—the Keynesian welfare state—that had motivated state strategies to harmonise interests through social policy, to politically regulate the market economy and thereby reduce class and diverse social conflicts, and to promulgate for the state a tutelary role in securing business and trade union acquiescence (and less commonly approval) for a limited set of important economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;J. Krieger, "Social policy in the age of Reagan and Thatcher," ''Socialist Register'' 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
Historian Doug Rossinow reported in 2007, "As of this writing, among academic historians, the Reagan revisionists—who view the 1980s as an era of mixed blessings at worst, and of great forward strides in some renditions—hold the field".&lt;ref&gt;Doug Rossinow, "Talking Points Memo," in American Quarterly 59.4 (2007) p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars agree on the importance of the Reagan Era.&lt;ref&gt;See  Troy (2009); Hayward (2009); Wilentz (2008); Charles L. Ponce de Leon, "The New Historiography of the 1980s", ''Reviews in American History'', Volume 36, Number 2, June 2008, pp. 303–314; Whitney Strub, "Further into the Right: The Ever-Expanding Historiography of the U.S. New Right," ''Journal of Social History'', Volume 42, Number 1, Fall 2008, pp. 183–194; Kim Phillips-Fein, "Ronald Reagan: Fate, Freedom, and Making of History," ''Enterprise &amp; Society'', Volume 8, Number 4, December 2007, pp. 986–988.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Ronald Syme''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|OM|FBA}} (11 March 1903 – 4 September 1989) was a [[New Zealand]]-born historian and [[classics|classicist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Ronald Syme, 86, Classics Scholar And Historian at Oxford, Is Dead |journal= The New York Times |date= September 7, 1989 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/07/obituaries/ronald-syme-86-classics-scholar-and-historian-at-oxford-is-dead.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowersock |first= G. W.|title= Ronald Syme (March 11, 1903-September 4, 1989) |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |pages= 118-122 |volume= 135|issue=1 |date=March 1991 |JSTOR= 987156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Long associated with [[Oxford University]], he is widely regarded as the 20th century's greatest historian of ancient Rome. His great work was ''[[The Roman Revolution]]'' (1939), a masterly and controversial analysis of Roman political life in the period following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]].

==Life==
Syme was born to David and Florence Syme in [[Eltham, New Zealand]], where he attended primary and secondary school; a bad case of [[measles]] seriously damaged his vision during this period. He moved to [[New Plymouth Boys' High School]] (a house of which bears his name today) at the age of 15, and was head of his class for both of his two years. He continued to the [[University of Auckland]] and [[Victoria University of Wellington]], where he studied French language and [[French literature|literature]] while working on his degree in Classics. He was then educated at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] between 1925 and 1927, gaining  First Class honours in [[Literae Humaniores]] ([[ancient history]] and philosophy). In 1926, he won the [[Gaisford Prize]] for Greek Prose for translating a section of [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' into Platonic prose, and the following year won the Prize again (for Verse) for a translation of part of [[William Morris]]'s ''[[The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs|Sigurd the Volsung]]'' into [[Homer]]ic [[hexameter]]s.

His first scholarly work was published by the ''Journal of Roman Studies'' in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;"Rhine and Danube Legions under Domitian", ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 18 (1928) 41–55; see Anthony Birley, "Editor's Introduction", in ''The Provincial at Rome'' (Presses Université Laval, 2000), p. xi [https://books.google.com/books?id=D5IxWxCgFFwC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Syme%27s+first+published+work%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online] and pp. xi–xx on Syme's publications and scholarly career.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 he became a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]], where he became known for his studies of the [[Roman army]] and the frontiers of the Empire. During the [[Second World War]], he worked as a press attaché in the British Embassies of [[Belgrade]] (where he acquired a knowledge of [[Serbo-Croatian]]) and [[Ankara]], later taking a chair in classical philology at [[Istanbul University]]. His refusal to discuss the nature of his work during this period led some to speculate that he worked for the British intelligence services in [[Turkey]], but proof for this hypothesis is lacking.

Sir Ronald's work at Unesco is referred to in the autobiographical works of a collaborator, [[Jean d'Ormesson]].

After being elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1944, Syme was appointed [[Camden Professor of Ancient History]] at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] in 1949, a position which he held until his retirement in 1970. Syme was also appointed Fellow of [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] from 1970 until the late 1980s, where an annual lecture was established in his memory.

Syme was knighted in 1959 and received the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]] in 1976. He continued his prolific writing and editing until his death at the age of 86.

==Major works ==
The work for which he is chiefly remembered, ''[[The Roman Revolution]]'' (1939), is widely considered a masterly and controversial analysis of Roman political life in the period following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]]. Inspired by the rise of fascist regimes in Germany and Italy, and following [[Tacitus]] in both literary style and pessimistic insight, the work challenged prevailing attitudes concerning the last years of the [[Roman Republic]]. Syme's main conclusion was that the structure of the Republic and its Senate were inadequate for the needs of Roman rule; Augustus was merely doing what was necessary to restore order in public life, but was a dictatorial figure whose true nature was cloaked by the panegyrics written to honour him in his last years and after his death. "The Roman constitution", he wrote, "was a screen and a sham"; [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian]]'s supposed restoration of the Republic was a pretence on which he had built a monarchy based on personal relationships and the ambition of Rome's political families.  In ''The Roman Revolution,'' Syme first used, with dazzling effect, the [[historical method]] of [[prosopography]]—tracing the linkages of kinship, marriage, and shared interest among the various leading families of republican and imperial Rome.  By stressing prosopographical analysis, Syme rejected the force of ideas in politics, dismissing most such invocations of constitutional and political principle as nothing more than "political catchwords."  In this bleak cynicism about political ideas and political life, ''The Roman Revolution'' strongly resembled another controversial historical masterwork, ''[[The Structure of English Politics at the Accession of George III]]'', published in 1930 by the specialist in eighteenth-century British political history, Sir [[Lewis B. Namier]].

Syme's next great work was his definitive two-volume biography of [[Tacitus]] (1958), his favourite among the ancient historians. The work's forty-five chapters and ninety-five appendices make up the most complete [[Tacitean studies|study of Tacitus]] yet produced, backed by an exhaustive treatment of the historical and political background—the Empire's first century—of his life.  Syme blended biographical investigation, historical narrative and interpretation, and literary analysis to produce what may be the single most thorough study of a major historian ever published.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In 1958, Oxford University Press published ''Colonial Élites. Rome, Spain and the Americas'', which presents the three lectures that he offered at McMaster University in January 1958 as part of the Whidden Lectures. Syme compares the three empires that have endured for the longest periods of time in Western History: Rome, Spain, and Britain. Syme considers that the duration of an Empire is directly linked to the character of the men who are in charge of the imperial administration, in particular that of the colonies. In his own words, the "strength and vitality of an empire is frequently due to the new aristocracy from the periphery." This book is currently out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lasfloresdelmarinero.blogspot.com/2010/05/colonial-elites-rome-spain-and-americas.html |title=Colonial Élites.

Syme's biography of [[Sallust]] (1964), based on his [[Sather Lectures]] at the [[University of California]], is also regarded{{By whom|date=October 2009}} as authoritative. His four books and numerous essays on the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' firmly established the fraudulent nature of that work; he famously dubbed the anonymous author "a rogue grammarian".&lt;ref&gt;''Emperors and Biography'' (Oxford, 1971), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''History in Ovid'' (1978) places the great Roman poet [[Ovid]] firmly in his social context.

Syme's ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' (1986) traces the prominent families under Augustus as a sequel to ''The Roman Revolution''.  Syme examined how and why Augustus promoted bankrupt patrician families and new politicians simultaneously to forge a coalition in government that would back his agenda for a new Rome.

A posthumous work (edited for publication by A. Birley), ''Anatolica'' (1995), is devoted to [[Strabo]] and deals with the geography of southern Armenia and mainly eastern parts of Asia Minor. His shorter works are collected in the seven volumes of ''Roman Papers'' (1979–1991), the first two volumes of which are edited by [[E. Badian]], and the remainder by Anthony Birley.

Syme's doctoral students at the University of Oxford included [[Barbara Levick]], whose thesis in the mid 1950s was Roman colonies in South Asia minor, and  [[Miriam T. Griffin]] (1968),  whose thesis was entitled ''Seneca: The Statesman and the Writer,''  

==Legacy==
*[[Victoria University of Wellington]]'s Classics Department holds a lecture in Syme's honour every two years.

[[File:Samuel Daniel.jpg|thumb|Samuel Daniel. Frontispiece engraving for ''The Civile Ware'' (1609) by [[Thomas Cockson]].]]

'''Samuel Daniel''' (1562 – 14 October 1619) was an English [[English poetry|poet]] and [[History of England|historian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB
 |wstitle= Daniel, Samuel
 |volume= 14
 |author = Sidney Lee
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at [[Oxford University]] before becoming tutor to the family of [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Lord Herbert]] and later other members of the aristocracy. He translated work from Latin to English and then began to publish his own prose and verse. In 1603 he was given a royal appointment and produced a series of [[masque]]s. In the early 17th century he associated with other well known writers of the time before retiring to the village of [[Beckington]] in [[Somerset]].

His work and particularly the format he adopted for sonnets, was referred to and emulated by later writers.

==Early life==
Daniel was born near [[Taunton]] in Somerset, the son of a music-master. He was the brother of [[lute]]nist and composer [[John Danyel]]. Their sister, whose name is unknown, may have married Daniel's friend [[John Florio]]. In 1579, Daniel was admitted to Magdalen Hall (now known as [[Hertford College]]) at [[Oxford University]], where he remained for about three years and afterwards devoted himself to the study of poetry and philosophy. A "Samuel Daniel" is recorded in 1586 as being the servant of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Baron Stafford|Edward Stafford]], the [[Baron Stafford|Baron of Stafford]] and the English ambassador in France. This is probably the same person as the poet.&lt;ref name=eb1911&gt;Chisholm, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
He was first encouraged and, by his own account, taught in verse, by the [[Mary Sidney|Countess of Pembroke]], whose honour he was never weary of proclaiming. He had entered her household as tutor to her son, [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Lord Herbert]]. His first known work, a translation of [[Paulus Jovius]], to which some original matter is appended, was printed in 1585.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

His first known volume of verse is dated 1592; it contains the cycle of [[sonnet]]s addressed to "Delia" and a romance called ''The Complaint of Rosamond''. Twenty-seven of the sonnets had already been printed at the end of Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]'' without the author's consent. Several editions of ''Delia'' appeared in 1592, and they were very frequently reprinted during Daniel's lifetime. Dedicated to "The Right Honourable the Lady Mary Countess of Pembroke", we learn that Delia lived on the banks of the River Avon—not [[River Avon, Warwickshire|Shakespeare's]], but the [[River Avon, Hampshire|one]] which flowed through "where Delia has her seat" at Wilton in Wiltshire—and that the sonnets to her were inspired by her memory when the poet was in Italy. To an edition of ''Delia and Rosamond'', in 1594, was added the [[tragedy]] of ''Cleopatra'', written in classical style, in alternately rhyming [[heroic verse]], with choral interludes. ''The First Four Books of the Civil Wars'', a historical poem on the subject of the [[Wars of the Roses]], in ''[[ottava rima]]'', appeared in 1595.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

As far as is known, it was not until 1599 that there was published a volume entitled ''Poetical Essays'', which contained, besides the "Civil Wars," "[[Musophilus]]" and "A letter from Octavia to Marcus Antonius," poems in Daniel's finest and most mature manner. About this time he became tutor to Lady [[Anne Clifford]], daughter of the [[Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland]]. On the death of [[Edmund Spenser]], in the same year, Daniel received the somewhat vague office of [[Poet Laureate]], which he seems, however to have shortly resigned in favour of [[Ben Jonson]].  At about this time, and at the recommendation of his brother-in-law, [[Giovanni Florio]], he was taken into favour at court and wrote a ''[[Panegyric]]ke Congratulatorie'' in ''ottava rima''&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; which he offered to King James I of England at [[Burley-on-the-Hill|Burleigh Harrington]] in [[Rutland]] during James' initial progression from Edinburgh to claim the throne in London.

The Panegyricke is included in the presentation [[Folio (printing)|folio]] of 1601, the first folio volume of collected works by a living English poet, but would not have been presented or published until after Queen Elizabeth's death in 1603. Many later editions contained in addition his ''Poetical Epistles'' to his patrons and an elegant prose essay called ''A Defence of Rime''. This was not just a defense of rhyme  in the formal sense, but of the idea of there being positive post-classical literary developments. As Nicholas Birns puts it, Daniel's defense of rhyme entails "a defense of the medieval, or at least what comes between him and the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Birns, 'Barbarian Memory: The Legacy of Early Medieval History in Early Modern Literature'. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; 'He even went so far as seeing [[Tamburlaine]] in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play as 'a barbarian to be admired'.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Floyd-Wilson English Ethnicity and Race and Early Modern Drama Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, Daniel was appointed master of the queen's revels. In this capacity he brought out a series of [[masques]] and pastoral tragi-comedies—of which were printed ''[[The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses]]'' (1604); ''The Queen's Arcadia'', an adaptation of [[Giovanni Battista Guarini|Guarini]]'s [[Il pastor fido|''Pastor Fido'']] (1606); ''[[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]]' Festival or the Queenes Wake'', written on the occasion of Prince [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]]'s becoming a [[Knight of the Bath]] (1610); and ''Hymen's Triumph'', in honour of [[Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe|Lord Roxburghe]]'s marriage (1615).&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; As a dramatist, Daniel maintained a traditional relationship with Court and University, and had little to do with the popular drama that was such a striking development of his culture in his era. As a result, he was largely insulated from the turmoil that sometimes enveloped the popular drama—though not totally: a 1604 performance of his play ''[[Philotas]]'' led to his being called before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. The hero of the play was perceived to resemble [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]]—a troubling connection, given the Earl's 1601 execution for treason.&lt;ref&gt;Curiously, Daniel served as a sort of assistant censor for the [[Master of the Revels]] around this time, with specific responsibility for the [[Children of the Chapel]] company – in precisely the years when that company was performing its most scandalous productions, ''[[Eastward Hoe]]'' and ''[[The Isle of Gulls]]''. Grace Ioppolo, ''Dramatists and Their Manuscripts in the Age of Shakespeare, Jonson, Middleton and Heywood,'' London, Routledge, 2006; p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1605, ''Certain Small Poems'' appeared, with the [[tragedy]] of ''Philotas''. ''Certaine small Workes heretofore divulged by Samuel Daniel'' (1607) was a heavily revised version of all his works except ''Delia'' and the ''Civil Wars'', considered by some to be rewrites of his previous works more than simple revisions. In 1609 the ''Civil Wars'' had been completed in eight books. In 1612 Daniel published a prose ''History of England'', from the earliest times down to the end of the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. This popular work was continued and published in 1617. The section dealing with [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] was published in 1692 as being the work of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

Daniel was made a gentleman-extraordinary and groom of the chamber to Queen [[Anne of Denmark|Anne]], [[sinecure]] offices which did not interfere with his literary career. He was acknowledged as a leading writer of the time. [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Selden]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[George Chapman]] were among the few friends allowed to visit his secluded home in Old Street, St Luke's, where, [[Thomas Fuller]] tells us, he would "lie hid for some months together, the more retiredly to enjoy the company of the [[Muses]], and then would appear in public to converse with his friends." Late in life Daniel threw up his titular posts at court and retired to a farm called "The Ridge", in the hamlet of [[Beckington]], Somerset, now called [[Rudge, Somerset|Rudge]]. He died there on 14 October 1619.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; He was buried in the graveyard of [[Church of St George, Beckington|St George's Church]] in Beckington; inside the church there is a memorial to him.

==Works==
Daniel's poetic works are numerous, but were long neglected. This is more surprising since, during the 18th century, when so little Elizabethan literature was read, Daniel retained his prestige. Later, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] and others praised him. Of his works the sonnets are now, perhaps, most read. They depart from the Italian sonnet form in closing with a [[couplet]], as is the case with most of the sonnets of [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]] and [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], but they have a grace and tenderness all their own. Of a higher order is ''The Complaint of Rosamond'', a [[soliloquy]] in which the ghost of the murdered woman appears and bewails her fate in [[stanza]]s of exquisite pathos. Among the ''Epistles to Distinguished Persons'' will be found some of Daniel's noblest stanzas and most polished verse. The epistle to [[Lucy, Countess of Bedford]], is remarkable among those as being composed in genuine ''[[terza rima]]'', till then not used in English. Daniel was particularly fond of a four-lined stanza of solemn alternately rhyming [[Iamb (foot)|iambics]], a form of verse distinctly misplaced in his dramas. These, inspired by the Countess of Pembroke, are less successful than his pastorals; and ''Hymen's Triumph'' is considered the best of his dramatic writing. An extract from this masque is given in Lamb's ''Dramatic Poets'', and was highly praised by Coleridge.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

Daniel was a great innovator in verse.  The 1911 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''  says of him: "His style is full, easy and stately, without being very animated or splendid; it is content with level flights. As a [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]] writer Daniel approaches Chapman, but is more musical and coherent. He lacks fire and passion, but he has scholarly grace and tender, mournful reverie."&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

Daniel has been suggested as a possible author of the anonymous play ''[[The Maid's Metamorphosis]]'' (1600), though no consensus on the argument has been achieved. Daniel's works were edited by [[Alexander Balloch Grosart|A. B. Grosart]] from 1885 to 1896.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; Projected scholarly editions of the complete works, including that planned by the [[Oxford University Press]], have not yet been published.  A recent edition of his major poetry, with explanatory notes, is ''Samuel Daniel: Selected Poetry and A Defence of Rhyme'' (Asheville, NC: Pegasus Press, 1998), by Geoffrey Hiller and Peter Groves.

==Cultural references==
A reference to Daniel's ''Sonnets to Delia'' is made in [[George Eliot]]'s 19th-century novel, ''[[Middlemarch]]'', when Mr. Casaubon is declaring his love for Miss Brooke.  "Would it not be rash to conclude that there was no passion behind those sonnets to Delia which strike us as the thin music of a mandolin?"

[[Saul Bellow]] refers to Daniel's "Behold how every man, drawn with delight" in ''[[Humboldt's Gift]]''. Charlie Citrine, the protagonist and narrator, is discussing the problem of death with his girlfriend and says to himself, "Whilst timorous knowledge stands considering, audacious ignorance hath done the deed."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17708">'''Soviet anti-Zionism''' was a [[Soviet propaganda|propaganda]] doctrine promulgated in the Soviet Union during the course of the [[Cold War]], which intensified after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. It was officially sponsored by the department of propaganda of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and by the [[KGB]]. It alleged that [[Zionism]] was a form of [[racism]], and argued that Zionists were similar to [[Nazism|Nazis]]. The Soviet Union framed its anti-Zionist propaganda in terms of the ideological doctrine of '''Zionology''', in the guise of a study of modern Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hashim S. H. Behbehani|title=The Soviet Union and Arab nationalism, 1917-1966|year=1986|page=69|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7103-0213-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
From late 1944, [[Joseph Stalin]] adopted a [[Zionism|pro-Zionist]] foreign policy, apparently believing that the new country would be [[socialism|socialist]] and would speed the decline of [[United Kingdom|British]] influence in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], ''A History of the Jews'' (1987) p.527&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in November 1947, the [[Soviet Union]], together with the other [[Soviet bloc]] countries voted in favor of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/UN%20General%20Assembly%20Resolution%20181 UN General Assembly Resolution 181] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; which paved the way for the creation of the State of Israel. On May 17, 1948, three days after [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, May 14, 1948|Israel declared its independence]], the Soviet Union officially granted [[de jure]] recognition of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2193961 Recognition of Israel] ''JSTOR'' - ''The American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 4, No. 3, July 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming only the second country to recognise the Jewish state (preceded only by the United States' ''[[de facto]]'' recognition) and the first country to grant Israel ''de jure'' recognition.

In his 1969  book ''Beware! Zionism'', Yuri Ivanov, Soviet Union's leading Zionologist, defined modern Zionism as follows:
:Modern Zionism is the ideology, a ramified system of organisations and the practical politics of the wealthy Jewish [[bourgeoisie]] which has closely allied itself with monopoly circles in the USA and other imperialist countries. The main content of Zionism is bellicose [[chauvinism]] and [[anti-communism]].&lt;ref&gt;CAUTION: ZIONISM! Essays on the Ideology, Organisation and Practice of Zionism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet leaders insisted that Soviet anti-Zionism was not anti-Semitic. As proof, they pointed to the fact that several notable Zionologists were ethnic [[Jew]]s representing an expert opinion. Many—including some within the Soviet Union itself—argued that Zionology exhibited anti-Semitic themes. For example, in November 1975, the leading Soviet historian and academic M. Korostovtsev wrote a letter to the Secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] [[Mikhail Suslov]], regarding the book ''The Encroaching Counter Revolution'' by [[Vladimir Begun]]: "...it perceptibly stirs up [[anti-Semitism]] under the flag of [[anti-Zionism]]."

Some Zionology books, "exposing" [[Zionism]] and [[Judaism]], were included in the mandatory reading list for military and police personnel, students, teachers and Communist Party members and were mass published.

The third edition of the thirty-volume [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (Большая Советская энциклопедия, БСЭ), published in 1969-1978, qualifies Zionism as racism and makes the following assertions:
* "the main posits of modern Zionism are militant [[chauvinism]], [[racism]], [[anti-Communism]] and [[anti-Sovietism]]"
* "the anti-human reactionary essence of Zionism" is "overt and covert fight against freedom movements and against the USSR"
* "International Zionist Organization owns major financial funds, partly through Jewish monopolists and partly collected by Jewish mandatory charities", it also "influences or controls significant part of media agencies and outlets in the West"
* "serving as the front squad of [[colonialism]] and [[neo-colonialism]], international Zionism actively participates in the fight against national liberation movements of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America"
* "A natural and objective assimilation process of Jews is growing around the world."&lt;ref name=gse&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://encycl.yandex.ru/art.xml?art=bse/00071/37300.htm&amp;encpage=bse&amp;mrkp=http://hghltd.yandex.com/yandbtm?url=http%3A//encycl.yandex.ru/texts/bse/00071/37300.htm&amp;text=%F1%E8%EE%ED%E8%E7%EC&amp;reqtext=%F1%E8%EE%ED%E8%E7%EC%3A%3A781659&amp;&amp;isu=2 Сионизм]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Большая советская энциклопедия) ([[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition. 1969-1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

The official position of the Soviet Union and its satellite states and agencies was that Zionism was a tool used by the Jews and Americans for "racist [[imperialism]]." The meaning of the term ''Zionism'' was defined by the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]: "the main posits of modern Zionism are militant chauvinism, racism, anti-Communism and anti-Sovietism... overt and covert fight against freedom movements and the USSR."&lt;ref name=gse /&gt;

In his book ''A History of the Jews in the Modern World'', [[Howard Sachar]] describes the atmosphere of the Soviet "anti-Zionist" campaign in the wake of the [[Six-Day War]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In late July 1967, Moscow launched an unprecedented propaganda campaign against Zionism as a "world threat." Defeat was attributed not to tiny Israel alone, but to an "all-powerful international force." ... In its flagrant vulgarity, the new propaganda assault soon achieved Nazi-era characteristics. The Soviet public was saturated with racist canards. Extracts from Trofim Kichko's notorious 1963 volume, ''Judaism Without Embellishment'', were extensively republished in the Soviet media. Yuri Ivanov's ''Beware: Zionism'', a book essentially replicated ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', was given nationwide coverage."&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Sachar]], ''A History of the Jews in the Modern World'' (New York: Knopf, 2005) p.722&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A similar picture was drawn by [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]]:
:the [[mass media]] "all over the Soviet Union portrayed the Zionists (i.e. Jews) and Israeli leaders as engaged in a world-wide conspiracy along the lines of the old ''Protocols of Zion''. It was, ''Sovietskaya Latvia'' wrote 5 August 1967, an 'international [[Cosa Nostra]] with a common centre, common programme and common funds'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], ''A History of the Jews'' (1987) p.575-576&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli government was also referred to as a "[[state terror|terrorist regime]]" which "has raised terror to the level of state politics." Even regarding the [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe hostage crisis]], Soviet media reported: "[[Israel]] committed an act of aggression against [[Uganda]], assaulting the Entebbe airport."&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper ''Novoye Vremya'', cited in edition ''Välispanoraam 1981'' (''Foreign Panorama 1981''), (Tallinn, 1982) p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Johnson and other historians have also argued that [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] of 10 November 1975 that equated "Zionism" with "[[racism]]" was orchestrated by the Soviet Union. Resolution 3379 was pioneered by the Soviet Union and passed with numerical support from Arab, Muslim and African states amidst accusations that Israel was supportive of the apartheid regime in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/un/un-general-assembly-resolution-3379-racial-discrimination/p11284 UN General Assembly Resolution 3379, Racial Discrimination (Council on Foreign Relations, November 10, 1975)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130141738/http://www.cfr.org/un/un-general-assembly-resolution-3379-racial-discrimination/p11284 |date=January 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though ten days before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Soviet sponsored [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379#Revocation|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/86]] was adopted on 16 December 1991 which revoked the determination in
[[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]].&lt;ref name="NYT: U.N. Repeals Its '75 Resolution Equating Zionism With Racism"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/17/world/un-repeals-its-75-resolution-equating-zionism-with-racism.html |title=U.N.

On 1 April 1983, official newspaper of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], ''[[Pravda]]'', ran a full front-page article titled ''From the Soviet Leadership'':
: "...By its nature, Zionism concentrates ultra-nationalism, chauvinism and racial intolerance, excuse for territorial occupation and annexation, military opportunism, cult of political promiscuousness and irresponsibility, demagogy and ideological diversion, dirty tactics and perfidy... Absurd are attempts of Zionist ideologists to present criticizing  them, or condemning the aggressive politics of the Israel's ruling circles, as antisemitic... We call on all Soviet citizens: &lt;u&gt;workers, peasants, representatives of intelligentsia&lt;/u&gt;: take active part in exposing Zionism, strongly rebuke its endeavors; &lt;u&gt;social scientists&lt;/u&gt;: activate scientific research to criticize reactionary core of that ideology and aggressive character of its political practice; &lt;u&gt;writers, artists, journalists&lt;/u&gt;: fuller expose anti-populace and anti-humane diversionary character of propaganda and politics of Zionism..." (highlights in original)

Also, at the same time, the CPSU set up the [[Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public]] as an anti-Zionist propaganda tool.

Another recurring Zionology theme was the allegation of secret ties between the Nazis and the Zionist leadership. The thesis of 1982 doctoral [[dissertation]] of [[Mahmoud Abbas]], a co-founder of [[Fatah]] and one of the leaders of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and [[President of the Palestinian National Authority]] who earned his Ph.D. in history at the Oriental College in [[Moscow]], was ''The Secret Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement''.&lt;ref name="Seddon2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Seddon|title=A political and economic dictionary of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmYMy1Ls8ucC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=28 August 2011|year=2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-85743-212-1|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wymaninstitute.org/articles/2003-06-contradictions.php The David S Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies - Bush at Auschwitz: Troubling Contradictions ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041030144454/http://www.wymaninstitute.org/articles/2003-06-contradictions.php |date=2004-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to HNN, "Abbas claimed in his work that the Zionist leadership was interested in convincing the world that a large number of Jews were killed during the war in order to “attain larger gains” after the war and to "divide the booty." Abbas’ primary claim in his thesis is that the Zionist movement and its various branches worked hand in hand with the Nazis against the Jewish people, collaborating with them for the Jews’ destruction because the Zionist leaders viewed “Palestine” as the only legitimate place for Jewish immigration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/1414.html History News Network - Was Abu Mazen a Holocaust Denier?, 28 April 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; The doctoral thesis was published as a book in 1984 under the title ''[[The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism'' by Mahmoud Abbas. ASIN B007OKKE9Q&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1985 [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became the Secretary General of the CPSU and in April he declared [[perestroika]]. It took more than six years before Moscow consented to restore diplomatic relations with Israel on October 19, 1991, just 2 months prior to the collapse of the USSR and ten days before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Soviet sponsored [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379#Revocation|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/86]] was adopted on 16 December 1991 which revoked the determination in
[[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]], which had called Zionism a form of racism.&lt;ref name="NYT: U.N. Repeals Its '75 Resolution Equating Zionism With Racism"/&gt;

The '''Steppe Route''' was an ancient overland route through the [[Eurasian Steppe]] that was an active precursor of the [[Silk Road]]. Silk and horses were traded as key commodities; secondary trade included furs, weapons, musical instruments, precious stones (turquoise, lapis lazuli, agate, nephrite) and jewels. This route extended for approximately {{Convert|10000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/rarebook/02/index.html.en|title=The Horses of the Steppe: The Mongolian Horse and the Blood-Sweating Stallions {{!}}  Silk Road in Rare Books|website=dsr.nii.ac.jp|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Trans-Eurasian trade through the Steppe Route precedes the conventional date for the origins of the Silk Road by at least two millennia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Steppe Route centers on the North Asian steppes and connects [[eastern Europe]] to [[Northeast China|north-eastern China]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miho.or.jp/english/member/shangrila/tpshan23.htm|title=Eurasian winds toward Silla|last=Miho Museum News (Shiga, Japan)|first=Volume 23, March 2009|date=22 February 2017|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409105904/http://www.miho.or.jp/english/member/shangrila/tpshan23.htm|archive-date=2016-04-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eurasian Steppe]] has a wide and plane topography, and a unique [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=TVVkDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=steppe+route&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O9TxFVTEJe&amp;sig=lk4QsxhTJ72l_0OJRd2mUwawfZU&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq6eGXxqbSAhUpAsAKHb3OBjQ4ChDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=steppe%20route&amp;f=false|title=Ancient Glass Research Along the Silk Road|last=Gan|first=Fuxi|date=2009-01-01|publisher=World Scientific|year=|isbn=9789812833570|location=|pages=44|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steppe Route extends from the mouth of the&amp;nbsp;[[Danube River]] to the&amp;nbsp;[[Pacific Ocean]]. It is bounded on the north by the forests of Russia and&amp;nbsp;[[Siberia]]. There is no clear southern boundary, although the southern semi-deserts and deserts impede travel. The principal characteristic of the steppe landscape is its [[continental climate]] and the deficiency of moisture, which creates unstable conditions for farming. The steppe is interrupted at three points: the [[Ural Mountains|Ural mountains]], the [[Altai Mountains|Altai mountains]] which gradually turn into the [[Sayan Mountains|Sayan mountains]] in the east, and the [[Greater Khingan]] range; these divide the steppe into four segments that can be crossed by horsemen. The altitude of some mountainous barriers, such as the Altai Mountains, with elevations up to {{Convert|4000|m|ft}}, had originally kept some regions self-contained.

The vast territory stretching alongside the Eurasia route is diversified and includes [[Semi-arid climate|dry steppe]], [[desert]],  [[mountain]]s, [[Oasis|oases]], [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[river delta]]s, lowland steppe, mountain steppe, and [[forest steppe]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books/about/Nomads_of_the_Eurasian_Steppes_in_the_Ea.html?id=aSgSAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Nomads of the Eurasian Steppes in the Early Iron Age|last=Davis-Kimball|first=Jeannine|last2=Bashilov|first2=V.

[[Hippocrates]] reflected on the impact of climatic changes, on subsistence, and advanced the idea of their influence on the organisation of human communities, as an explanation to populations migration. The demographic pressure on farming areas on the Steppe Route probably led the more fragile groups located at the periphery of those farming areas to migrate in search of better living conditions. Since rich pastures were not always available, it fostered the transition to a nomadic existence. This lifestyle was conducive to human mobility and fostered a military culture necessary to protect herds and to conquer new territories. The specific geography of the steppe created an ecosystem capable of mixing critical development features, including the diffusion of modern humans, animal domestication and animal husbandry, spoke-wheeled chariot and cavalry warfare, early metal production (copper) and trade, [[Indo-European languages]], and the political rise of nomadic civilizations.

== Communities ==
As the [[Eurasian nomads]] are not known to have developed a [[written language]], no one knows what they called themselves, and the various cultures along the steppe road are mostly identified by distinctive burial arrangements and delicate artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=-Grpz1tmcSMC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=steppe+route+turkmenistan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DsqwrCNudl&amp;sig=7FxjAbMn3Ac2ssBxC2hBs93OeB8&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU74viqKfSAhWnKsAKHfByBgo4ChDoAQgoMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=steppe%20route%20turkmenistan&amp;f=false|title=The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate|last=Bryant|first=Edwin|last2=Bryant|first2=Edwin Francis|date=2001-09-06|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=|isbn=9780195137774|location=|pages=205|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the artifacts are a testimony of the degree of sophistication of the nomadic prewriting culture and craftmanship which dispells notions that nomadic communities were on average less developed than sedentary ones.

The predominant point of view is that the communities of the Eurasian steppe were clustered and not closely related from an ethnic point of view. On the one hand, each population had its own history. On the other hand, communities maintained close contacts with both their neighbors and with those further distant. French historian [[Fernand Braudel]] saw the presence of pastoral nomads as a disruptive force often interrupting periods of slow historical processes, allowing for rapid change and cultural oscillation.

The work confirmed that the semi-nomadic [[Arimaspi]]ans of the late fourth and early third centuries BCE were not only breeding horses for trade. These people were also savvy metallurgists, builders, potters, jewelers, woodcarvers and painters who left a durable influence at the confluent of the Eastern and Western world.

=== Upper paleolithic ===
[[File:Grave of princess of ukok.jpg|thumb|Pazyryk culture : Grave of princess of Ukok (Kazakhstan)]]
By the end of the [[Pliocene]], tectonic activity had created the major mountain ranges and lowlands, including the Aral and Caspian Sea basins and the Sarykamysh depression; the primitive Syrdarya, Zeravshan, Amudarya, Uzboi, Murghab, Tedzhen, Atrek, and Gorgan river systems were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books/about/Origins_of_Agriculture_in_Western_Centra.html?id=n0V-xi2wAwUC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Origins of Agriculture in Western Central Asia: An Environmental-Archaeological Study|last=Harris|first=David R.|date=2011-09-01|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=|isbn=1934536512|location=|pages=19–21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclical climatic changes between the [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]] epoch finally produced a warmer and less dry climate in the greater part of western Asia that led to the present-day configuration and ecology of the region. The first modern humans to migrate to Europe were hunter-gatherers; they probably started to move from Africa at the time of the Green Sahara episode. Fossils excavated in Mount Carmel, Israel in 2002, show that Homo Sapiens arrived earlier than initially thought at the gate of the Steppe route 177,000–194,000 years ago and possibly interbred with Neanderthals which inhabited some parts of Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Ewen|date=2018-01-25|title=Israeli fossils are the oldest modern humans ever found outside of Africa|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01261-5|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=554|issue=7690|pages=15–16|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-01261-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall migration diagram of these populations is still unclear. Then, these hunter-gatherers were slowly replaced around 9,000 BCE by new migrants from the Near East who had superior subsistence capacities due to their knowledge of primitive farming.

The dominant position occupied by nomadic communities in the ecological niche is a result of their nomadic military and technical superiority and is thought to have originated in the North Caucasian steppes as early as the 8th century BCE. The post glacial period was marked by a gradual rise of temperatures which peaked in the 5th and 4th millennia. These more hospitable conditions provided humans with grasslands and more stable food supplies and resulted in a sharp increase in their numbers. The regular collection of wild cereals led to the empirical breeding and selection of cereals (wheat, barley) that could be cultivated. It also led to the domestication of animals (donkeys, asses, horses, sheep, goats predecessors) to stockbreeding.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000944/094466e.pdf|title=History of Civilization of Central Asia, Volume I, Food-producing and other neolithic communities in Khorasan and Transoxonia: Eastern Iran Soviet Central Asia and Afghanistan|last=Sariadini|first=Viktor|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|pages=105, 125–126|isbn=978-92-3-102719-2|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the quality and quantity of artifacts varied from site to site, the general impression is that the development of craftsmanship contributed to more stable settlements and a more precise definition of routes connecting certain communities with each other. The [[Aurignacian]] culture spread through Siberia, and as a testimony of its presence, an Aurignacian venus was found near Irkutsk, on the Upper Angara river.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=CHzGvqRbV_IC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=steppe+route&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xmSvwDgL3V&amp;sig=nEP0lBgpItqNga0-N5L-Atg6xR0&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQoqvj_OnTAhWKORoKHfXZBXw4ChDoAQg2MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=steppe%20route&amp;f=false|title=The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia|last=Grousset|first=René|date=1970-01-01|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=|isbn=9780813513041|location=|pages=3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of the [[Magdalenian]] culture were also identified in Manchouria, Siberia and Hopei. Pastoralism introduced a qualitative leap in social development and prepared the necessary base for the creation of ancient semi nomadic civilizations along the Eurasian Steppe Route.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The analysis of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of skeletal collagen of the same human remains helps to classify their dietary background and to characterize the economy of the steppe communities. Strontium isotope analysis helps identify the various faunal and human movements between various regions. Oxygen isotope analysis is applied to reconstruct drinking habits and climatic change impact on populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=M4sFCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=neolithic+eurasian+steppe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-pliQGWqha&amp;sig=4uhLvB9j4VU-P3YC41RXYfrnETo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif67mcgP7TAhXF2xoKHVk3AXMQ6AEIXzAN#v=onepage&amp;q=neolithic%20eurasian%20steppe&amp;f=false|title=Prehistoric Mobility and Diet in the West Eurasian Steppes 3500 to 300 BC: An Isotopic Approach|last=Gerling|first=Claudia|date=2015-07-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|year=|isbn=9783110311211|location=|page=4|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of these factors aims at reconstructing a more precise picture of the living conditions of the time. The analysis of 1,500 mitochondrial genome lineages helped dating the arrival  in different regions of Europe of human hunter-gatherers who later developed a knowledge of farming. It was found that in central and south west Europe, these could mainly be traced to the Neolithic. In the central and eastern Mediterranean, the arrival of the first human migrants can be dated to the much earlier Late Glacial period.&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, Joana B. with Pr Richards and Dr Luisa Pereira of the Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology, University of Porto, Reconciling evidence from ancient and contemporary genomes: a major source for the European Neolithic within Mediterranean Europe, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences (2017).

The early acquaintance with a food-producing economy in the PontoCaspian Steppe is assigned to this period. The transition from a food-gathering to a food-producing economy through farming and stock-keeping, led to a profound social and cultural change. Hunting and river fishing have likely continued to play a significant role in subsistence, especially in the forest-steppe areas. This transition to animal husbandry played a critical role in the history of the rise of human society, and is a significant contributor to the "[[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic revolution]]". Simultaneously, a new way of life emerged with the construction of more comfortable settlements for plant and animal domestication, craft activities (resulting in the wide use of ornaments) and burial practices, including the erection of the first burial mounds in the [[Eneolithic]] period (the transition between Neolithic and the Bronze age).

The Inner Eurasian steppelands were occupied, possibly since the fourth millennium BCE, by nomadic communities practicing extensive forms of horse pastoralism, wandering from place to places.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This ensured that their contacts and influence would extend over large areas. The earliest evidence for small horse riding comes from the [[Sredny Stog culture|Sredny Stog]] communities of east Ukraine and with south Russia the domestication of the [[Bactrian camel]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; date to c. 4000 BCE. This two humps heavy load carrier is one of the most adaptive animals in the world capable to withstand temperatures from 40&amp;nbsp;°C -30&amp;nbsp;°C. On the East of Eurasia, agriculture was likely started by Indo-European communities ([[Tocharians]]) established in the [[Tarim Basin|Tarīm Basin]] (northwest China) around 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/rarebook/10/ |title=An Overview of the Silk Road: Time, Space and Themes {{!}}  Silk Road in Rare Books |website=dsr.nii.ac.jp |access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the West part of Eurasia, the [[writing]] revolution, dated from the same epoch originated from accounting in a primitive way and developed with the Sumerian concern to leave messages for the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225899662|title=From counting to cuneiform|last=Denise.|first=Schmandt-Besserat,|date=1992-01-01 |publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292707832|oclc=225899662}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sites.utexas.edu/dsb/files/2014/01/evolution_writing.pdf |title=The evolution of writing (abstract) |last=Schmandt-Besserat |first=Denise |date=25 January 2014 |website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Inner China which must then also be represented as half of the territory of the [[China|PRC]] i.e. excluding Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau as the association of loosely connected "macro-regions",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=oojNbYGlP6kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=fr&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=China in the Early Bronze Age: Shang Civilization |last=Thorp |first=Robert L. |date=2006-01-01|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=|isbn=0812239105|location=|pages=2–10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been discoveries of tortoise-shell carvings (e.g. [[Jiahu symbols|Jiahu]] symbols) dating back to c. 6200-6600 BCE.

=== Bronze Age ===
The transition period to the [[Bronze Age]] shows varying patterns in the different geographical regions of the steppe route, however, numerous craft activities involved the manufacture of ornaments, instrumental goods and domestic commodities. As early as the 6-5th millennium BCE ([[Vinča culture]], situated in what is now Serbia), the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppe]] can be traced as the homeland of copper production and then spread throughout the entire steppe zone over two millennia.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=5sI9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=steppe+route&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bnkhs8tYKj&amp;sig=NsGOnCVXXkkiZ_noa8mDaUIHgUc&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt-ubl_M3SAhVHOMAKHZ3RBbcQ6AEIYDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=steppe%20route&amp;f=false|title=By Steppe, Desert, and Ocean: The Birth of Eurasia|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|date=2015-09-24|publisher=OUP Oxford|year=|isbn=9780191003356|location=|pages=107–108|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the fourth millennium, copper technology was introduced in the Altai region by steppe herders. The Bronze age was marked by an abrupt cooling of the climate, which at the turn of the third-second millennium B.C. gave way to a new temperature rise more favourable to farming and herding. The dual use of a prehistoric cavalry and metal weapons probably laid the framework of a much more militarized and possibly more hostile environment, triggering the migration of the most peaceful - or weakest - homo sapiens populations to more remote parts of the steppe route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156301100800069X?via%3Dihub|title=Formation of the Eurasian Steppe Belt of Stockbreeding cultures: viewed from the prism of archeometallurgy and radiocarbon dating|last=Chernykh|first=Evgenij Nikolaevich|date=September 2008|website=|publisher=Elsevier|page=36-53, Volume 35, Issue 3|others=Institute of Archaeology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia|access-date=|edition=Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trades on the Steppe Routes show that the East Asian silk did not only come from China. The Neolithic remains (4000-3000 BCE) of the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom (Korea) showed earthenware with silkworm and mulberry leaf patterns and small carvings in rock of silkworms.

In the late 3rd millennium BCE, military-oriented stockbreeding communities settled in Eastern Central Asia (Sayan-Altai, Mongolia). The Nephrite (jade) Road materialized, the minerals were quarried in [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] and Yarkand and sold to China.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Communities were even more mobile on the Steppe route with the intruduction of carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156301100800069X?via%3Dihub|title=Formation of the Eurasian ‘steppe belt’ of stockbreeding cultures: viewed through the prism of archaeometallurgy and radiocarbon dating|last=Chernykh|first=E.N.|date=2008|publisher=Archaeology Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia 35 (3), Elsevier|pages=36–53|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.aeae.2008.11.003|volume=35|journal=Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dynastic ages ===
By 2000 BCE the network of Steppe Routes exchanges started to transition to the [[Silk Road]]. By the middle of this millennium, the “steppe route” cultures were well established. Slow moving groups following a heavy chariot with four plain wheels led by hunters and fishermen, who practised some form of productive economy, were gradually replaced or enslaved by herdsmen from the steppes and semi-deserts. Nomads rode small horses and knew how to fight from the horseback primarily with a bow which was the distinctive weapon from the steppe and sometimes even with a sword or a saber when he was more affluent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These mobile, energetic and resourceful communities using light war-chariots with wheels having a diameter up to one meter with ten spokes each drawn by horses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000944/094466e.pdf|title=History of civilization of Central Asia, Volume 1, The decline of the Bronze age and the movement of the tribes|last=Masson|first=V.M.|date=1992|website=|publisher=Unesco Publishing|pages=326–330|isbn=92-3-102719-0|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; spread in many different directions. This evolution strengthened an already robust system of vigorous and widespread exchanges within and sometimes beyond the Inner Eurasian steppes. And these early systems of exchange depended largely on the role of intertwined pastoralist communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9710.html|title=Stark, S., Rubinson, K., Samashev, Z., et al., eds.: Nomads and Networks: The Ancient Art and Culture of Kazakhstan. (Hardcover)|website=press.princeton.edu|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a complex pattern of migratory movements, transformations and cultural interactions alongside the steppe route. In the 2nd millennium BCE there were major shifts of population over a wide area of Central Asia, and the whole picture of ethnocultural development changed.
[[File:Korean dagger early iron age.jpg|thumb|Daggers, Early iron age (Korea)]]

According to the writings of Roman historian [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], Romans saw high-quality silk for the first time in 53 BCE, in the form of Parthian banners unfurled before the Roman defeat at the [[battle of Carrhae]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christian|first=David|date=2000-03-01|year=|title=Silk Roads or Steppe Roads?

Various artifacts, including glassware, excavated from tombs in Silla were similar to those found in the mediterranean part of the Roman Empire showing that exchange did take place between the two extremities of the Steppe road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/countries-alongside-silk-road-routes/republic-korea|title=Republic of Korea {{!}} SILK ROAD|website=en.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that the travel time for commercial goods from [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul) in Turkey to reach Gyeongju in Korea would not exceed six months. The inter-relation of China with the steppe route resulted in the brilliant progress of the Chinese civilization in the Yin ([[Shang dynasty|Shang]] 商) dynasty on the appearance of three major innovations most probably imported from the Eurasian steppe western communities : wheeled transport, the horse, and metallurgy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=5FzANyya1BEC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=S.+V.+Kiselev+(1960)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s29DOMw5Yu&amp;sig=m8BTp3BThsVcdSyUrD9N-qjee5Q&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwmouwsafSAhWDK8AKHUIuCfQQ6AEIMTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=S.%20V.%20Kiselev%20(1960)&amp;f=false|title=The Prehistory of the Silk Road|last=Kuzmina|first=E.

The common references which had been travelling alongside the Steppe Route can be traced from the Mediterranean to the Korean Peninsula in similar techniques, styles, cultures, and religions, and even disease patterns.

'''Steven Theodore Katz''' (born August 24, 1944) is a [[Jewish]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and scholar. He is the director of the Elie Wiesel Center for Judaic Studies at [[Boston University]] in [[Massachusetts]], United States, where he holds the Alvin J. and Shirley Slater Chair in Jewish and Holocaust Studies.

==Biography==
Katz was born in Jersey City, New Jersey.

He received his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge, England in 1972.

Prior to his appointment at Boston University, Prof. Katz taught at [[Dartmouth College]] from 1972 to 1984. He joined the faculty of [[Cornell University]] in 1984 through 1996 as  a Professor of Near Eastern Studies (Judaica); during the years 1985–1989 he served as Chair of the Department of Near Eastern Studies and Director of the Jewish Studies Program.  He has also held visiting posts at Yale, the University of California at Santa Barbara, Hebrew University (Jerusalem), the University of Pennsylvania, Yeshiva University, Harvard and [[Warwick University]].  He currently edits the journal Modern Judaism: A Journal of Jewish Ideas and Experience, published by Oxford University Press.

==Scientific research==

===Mysticism===

Katz adopts a "[[Contextualism|Contextualist]]" interpretation of [[mysticism]], and has contributed to and edited a number of books dealing with mysticism. He distinguishes two basic approaches to the scientific study and understanding of mysticism: an [[Essentialism|"essentialist model"]] and a [[Contextualism|"contextualist model"]].{{sfn|Kartz|2000|p=3}}

The essentialist model argues that mystical experience is independent of the sociocultural, historical and religious context in which it occurs, and regards all mystical experience in its essence to be the same.{{sfn|Kartz|2000|p=3}}

The contextualist model states that mystical experiences are shaped by the concepts "which the mystic brings to, and which shape, his experience".{{sfn|Kartz|2000|p=3}} What is being experienced is being determined by the expectations and the conceptual background of the mystic.{{sfn|Kartz|2000|p=3-4}}

===Jewish studies===
Katz has argued that [[the Holocaust]] is the only [[genocide]] that has occurred in history, and defines "Holocaust" to include only "the travail of European Jewry" and not other victims of the Nazis.&lt;ref name="novick"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Holocaust in American Life]] |last=Novick |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Novick |year=2000 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has argued this in depth in ''The Holocaust in Historical Context''; this was released as Volume 1 of three but it is unclear whether the planned second and third volumes have been abandoned.

Katz is the editor of ''Modern Judaism'', an academic quarterly. He was on the editorial board of the ''[[Encyclopaedia of the Holocaust]]'' (NY: Macmillan, 1990, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[English language|English-language]] editions). Professor Katz acts as an American representative on the [[European Union]] sponsored [[Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research|International Task Force on the Holocaust]]. Additionally, he still holds a position as Chair of the Holocaust Commission of the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture, after previously serving on the United States Holocaust Museum's Academic Committee for five years as their Chair.

==Controversy==
In early 1995 Katz's appointment as the director of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/arts/holocaust-museum-chooses-scholar-as-its-next-director.html&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward it was reported that Katz had been disciplined by Cornell for two matters. Katz had misrepresented how close a book he was writing  (The Holocaust in Historical Context) was to publication. In documents dating to 1983 Katz had claimed that the book's publication was imminent on Harvard University Press, while it actually only appeared in 1994 on Oxford University Press. A Cornell report found that Katz had "knowingly and deliberately misrepresented his claims of completed and published scholarly works."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/24/arts/new-director-of-museum-was-censured-by-cornell.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Katz was also punished by Cornell (his salary was frozen for years) because during a 1989 [[sabbatical]] he had accepted a paid teaching position at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in violation of Cornell policy. Katz maintained his innocence, but in the wake of much criticism from within the Jewish community and Holocaust museum board he stepped down in March 1995.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/arts/holocaust-museum-s-new-chief-resigns.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stolpersteine in Prague-Karlín''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in cadastral area [[Karlín]] of [[Prague]]. Since 2002, the district belongs to Praha 8. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých'', stones of the disappeareds.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

A '''synchronoptic view''' is a [[graphical|graphic]] display of a number of [[entity|entities]] as they proceed through time. A synchronoptic view can be used for many purposes but is best suited to the visual display of [[history]]. A number of related [[Chronology|timeline]]s can be drawn on a single chart showing which events and lives are contemporary and which are unconnected.

A synchronoptic view has important [[education]]al advantages. [[Visual perception|Visible]] information is much more easily learned, than when it is presented only in pure text form. [[History]] is an ideal subject for a synchronoptic view. Multiple [[timeline]]s are able to show how events interacted. Multiple lifelines can show which people were contemporaries.
([http://www.hyperhistory.com/chart/section.html See example])

A combination of maps is also synchronoptic when it displays successive moments in time.

==Etymology==
The [[concept]] in question is made [[Visual perception|visual]] &amp;mdash; hence ''optic''.
The elements are displayed [[Synchronization|synchronously]]: i.e. which events in one area happened at the same time as events in another seemingly unrelated area.
Thus ''synchron-optic''.

Synchronoptic also means visible at the same time", or "with parallel views". i.e. The user gets a view of all the information in one go.

==Carte chronographique==
[[File:Barbeu-Dubourg - Chronographie (Tableau 34).png|thumb|right|''Carte chronographique'' (1753)]]
[[Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg]] (1709–1779) was the first to develop a synchronoptical visualisation with his ''Chronographie universelle &amp; details qui en dependent pour la Chronologie &amp; les Genealogies'' (1753) abbreviated to ''Carte chronographique''.&lt;ref name=SB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt-Burkhardt|first1=Astrit|title=Learning in the Age of Enlightenment|url=http://georgemaciunas.com/exhibitions/knowledge-as-art-chance-computability-and-improving-education-thomas-bayes-alan-turing-george-maciunas/george-maciunas/maciunas-learning-machine-learning-in-the-age-of-enlightenment-by-astrit-schmidt-burkhardt/|website=http://georgemaciunas.com/|publisher=George Maciunas Foundation Inc.|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chronographic chart consisted of 35 prints which were designed to be stuck together in a row, enabling 6,500 years to be represented in 6.5 meters.&lt;ref name=SB/&gt; The horizontal axis representing the passage of time was consistent throughout, but the vertical axis was varied depending on the categories Barbeu-Dubourg considered relevant for that period of history.&lt;ref name=SB/&gt;

The '''Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act''' ('''SALSRA''') is a [[Bill (Proposed Law)|bill]] of the [[United States Congress]] passed into law on December 12, 2003.

The bill's stated purpose is to end what the United States sees as Syrian support for terrorism, to end Syria's presence in Lebanon, which has been in effect since the end of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1990, to stop Syria's alleged development of [[Weapons of mass destruction|WMD]]s, to cease Syria's illegal importation of Iraqi oil and to end illegal shipments of military items to anti-US forces in Iraq.

The bill was sponsored by Representative [[Eliot L. Engel]] (D) from New York and was introduced April 12, 2003.

==2013 Ghouta chemical attack==
In response to the use of chemical weapons against civilians during the 2013 [[Ghouta chemical attack]], president [[Barack Obama]] asked Congress to authorize the use of military force against Syria. An early draft of that authorization cites the Syria Accountability Act, saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/text-of-senate-draft-syria-war-authorization/ | title= Text of Senate Draft Syria War Authorization | date= September 3, 2013 | first= Niels|last= Lesniewski | publisher= [[Roll Call]] | accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas in the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Congress found that Syria’s acquisition of weapons of mass destruction threatens the security of the Middle East and the national security interests of the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Baltic Origins of Homer's Epic Tales''''' is an essay written by [[Felice Vinci]], a nuclear engineer and amateur historian, published for the first time in 1995.
The book, translated into several languages, submits a revolutionary idea about the geographical setting of the [[Iliad]] and [[Odyssey]]. Felice Vinci started reading Greek classics  and learned about a passage from the '''''De facie quae in orbe lunae apparet''''', by [[Plutarch]], which points out the location of [[Ogygia]]. This island became the point of departure of Vinci's theory.

According to his assumptions, the events told by Homer did not take place in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean area]], as the tradition asserts, but rather in the seas of [[Northern Europe]], the [[Baltic Sea]] and the Northern Atlantic.

==Details of the theory==
According to Vinci, the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] would have lived at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC on the coasts of the [[Baltic Sea]] and, towards the middle of the millennium, since the climate had become harder, they would have moved southward along the [[Dnepr]], reaching the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]]. The newcomers would have founded the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cities (the most ancient Mycenaean graves are rich in [[amber]], a typical Baltic product, whereas the latest ones are not) and would have named them with the names of their previous settlements in [[Scandinavia]], although not exactly in correspondence of their location, because of the physical differences between the two areas.

During their migration, they would have brought with themselves their traditional oral tales, which were poetic sagas set in their original homeland. Therefore, the [[Trojan war]] would not have taken place around the 13th century BC, as it is normally thought, but around the 18th century BC. Then the poems would have been transcribed later, after 800 or 900 years of oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 13–28 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the theory, it is important to remember that the [[Mycenaeans]] are not considered an aboriginal population, but are thought instead to have come to Greece around the 16th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 269–272 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt; Felice Vinci also reports the hypothesis formulated in the late 19th century by the Indian expert [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], according to whom Indoeuropean populations would have lived around the [[Arctic Circle]] in the past. On the other hand, the so-called 'Linear B' documents appear to have been written in a language which was a precursor of what later became Greek.
 
The main topic of Vinci's hypothesis is the incongruence between the geography described by [[Homer]] and the conformation of the Mediterranean lands, already noticed by [[Strabo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'', 13.1.27: "δ'ουκ ενθαῦτα ἶδρυται τὀ παλαιὀν Ἰλιον" ("the ancient Ilios is not located here").&lt;/ref&gt; The geographical descriptions provided by the Iliad and the Odyssey, on the contrary, perfectly adapts itself to Northern Europe, and the incongruity regarding the Mediterranean localities would be due to the application of the old Scandinavian names they were subject of. Also, the description Homer gives of climate would be more suitable for the Baltic regions.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 13–27 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification of Iliad's Homeric places===
Among the suggested identifications, [[Ithaca]] would coincide with the isle of [[Lyø]], in the Danish archipelago of [[South Funen Archipelago|South Funen]]: the shape and the position of this island is reflected in the Homeric description as the most western of the archipelago (whereas the present Ithaca has a different location among the [[Ionian Islands]]). Vinci goes as far as to identify an ancient [[dolmen]], present on the Danish isle and known as ''Klokkesten'' (the "bell stone"), with the "crow stone" described in the Odyssey, near the home of [[Eumaeus]], the swineherd.
The South Funen Archipelago is made up of four bigger islands, as in Homer: [[Dulichium]] corresponds with the Danish [[Langeland]], [[Cephalonia]] with [[Ærø]] and [[Zakynthos]] with [[Tåsinge]]. The book also highlights how Dulichium has never been identified in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 13–27 and 40–61 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]], in [[Boeotia]], would correspond with the Swedish town of [[Täby]], not far from Stockholm. There is also a town nearby called [[Tyresö]], whose name could concern the blind prophet [[Tiresias]], who was active in Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 301–306 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Troy]] would correspond with Toija, in Southern [[Finland]], near [[Turku]]. According to Vinci, the ancient Troy used to rise on the top of a hill, surrounded by two rivers ([[Simoeis]] and [[Scamander]] which join in the plain below, today flooded, a few kilometers from the sea. This hypothesis would be confirmed by the finding of Bronze Age ruins in the area.

The [[Hellespont]], which is said to be "wide", could not be identified with the long and narrow [[Dardanelles]] strait, but with the [[Gulf of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Pages 143–157 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt; Vinci also quotes the Danish chronicles written by the medieval historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]], which remind the Hellespontinians (a population inimical to the Danish) and the Roman name of Finland, ''Aeningia'' (whose meaning might be "Aeneas' land")

The Achaeans' settlements are identified on the basis of the [[Catalogue of Ships]], in the second book of the Iliad: Micenae would have stood in the same place as modern [[Copenhagen]] and [[Phthia]] in Estonia. The [[Peloponnese]] would be recognizable in the isle of [[Sjælland]], which is completely flat: this would be the reason why [[Telemachus]] goes from [[Pylos|Pylus]] to [[Sparta]] by land and not by sea. On the contrary, the Greek Peloponnese is neither flat nor an island.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 336–372 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification of Odyssey's Homeric places===
According to Vinci, Ulysses' journey would have taken place along the coasts of [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Also, the philosopher [[Crates of Mallus]] believed that Ulysses had sailed out of the Mediterranean  during his peregrinations (as reported by [[Aulus Gellius]], 14, 6, 3)&lt;/ref&gt; After being held back in Ogygia (identified with one of the [[Faroe Islands]], following Plutarch's passage mentioned above&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De facie quae in orbe lunae apparet'', 26&lt;/ref&gt;), the Odyssey relates that, after seventeen days on the sea, Ulysses reached [[Scheria]], home of the Phaiakians, described as a high rocky coast and densely wooded: this region, impossible to locate in the Mediterranean area, could be instead identified with the environs of [[Bergen]], at the mouth of river Figgjo, where several Bronze Age objects have been found (Scheria is never mentioned in the [[Odyssey]] as an island). The new position would explain why [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] had noticed that the sea used to flow back into the river: this phenomenon is due to ocean tides and does not occur in the Mediterranean. Other places visited by Ulysses could be located on the Norwegian coasts, too: [[Circe]]'s island, [[Aeaea]], and the places she describes (the Sirens, [[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]]) may be placed in the [[Lofoten]] archipelago, where tides on the ebb create the so-called [[maelstrom]], corresponding with the Scylla whirlpool which swallowed up Ulysses' ship and is described as forming three times a day, just like the maelstrom. In the end, Aeolus's island would be located somewhere in the [[Shetland|Shetland archipelago]], where winds exceeding 200&amp;nbsp;km/h often blow.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 89–125 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other myths===
According to Vinci, other Greek mythological tales are set in the same region. Among these, the Argonauts' journey, who are said to have reached [[Colchis]] sailing eastwards and arriving then at [[Aeaea]], from where they came back to Greece going westwards.
The identification of Colchis in the [[Black Sea]] and of Aeaea in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] would force to hypothesize for the Argonauts an improbable itinerary by ship in [[Continental Europe]], along the rivers [[Danube]], [[Po (river)|Po]] and [[Rhone]]. The navigation would be instead the memory of an ancient counter-clockwise circumnavigation of Scandinavia starting from the Baltic Sea, crossing [[Laponia (historical province)|Lapponia]] overland along the rivers which run through it and reaching [[Lofoten]], where Aeaea had been identified. According to what [[Circe]] tells Ulysses, Argonauts chose for their journey home the course passing through the Wanderers Rocks, which are to be identified with the narrow straits covered by the streams between the islands and the mainland.

Another reference to an ancient Nordic setting can be found, according to Vinci, in an assertion by [[Plato]] in his dialogue [[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]], where the philosopher reminds that Athens used to rise formerly in a flat fertile zone, not harsh and mountainous: this particular is presented in the book as a reference to the ancient Baltic Athens, which might be located near the town of [[Karlskrona]] (in the surroundings there is another little town, named [[Lyckeby]], whose name might remind the [[Mount Lycabettus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pages 331–335 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate in Homeric poems===
The climate described by Homer is cold and stormy: mist and wind often appear and storms are heavy. The characters are often covered with thick cloaks and are never described as sweating because of the heat. Although in the period normally chosen to date the Trojan War (8th century BC) the average temperature was lower than it is nowadays, the Homeric weather conditions are difficult to adapt to the Aegean area, especially considering that the events are likely to be happened in summer. According to Vinci, instead, this descriptions would be perfect for the Baltic regions in the 18th century BC (which would be the real period of the Trojan War) when temperatures in Northern Europe were by far higher than now: the drop in temperatures at a later time would have forced Achaeans to emigrate southwards.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 422–463 in the 2008 Italian edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Some passages of the Iliad and the Odyssey have been interpreted by Vinci as a description of typical Nordic phenomena. For instance, in the great battle between Achaeans and Trojans, linchpin of Iliad's central books, the time of noon is quoted at two different moments: in the author's opinion, this wouldn't be a mistake: the battle would have simply continued for two consecutive days, thanks to the midnight sun, which let the warriors carry on fighting. Other references to this phenomenon are the exceptional duration of the day among the [[Laestrygonians]] and Ulysses' uncertainty when trying to find his way to [[Aeaea]], since he cannot figure out where the sun rises and where it sets.

===Cultural similarities===
Both in Homeric poems and among the [[Vikings]] it is possible to find similar features regarding traditions, mythology and literature. According to Vinci, these might have survived even in such a long period of time (more than 2.000 years). The author reminds the custom of assembling for a meeting, the majestic convivial banquets, the kind of exile imposed to those guiltiy of unintentional homicide. In addition, the Achaean ships would have in common with the Viking ones the dismountable mast, considered useful especially in the Northern seas to avoid the formation of ice, and the double bow, which allowed oarsmen to travel backwards (a reference to this aspect might be the Greek term ἀμφιέλισσαι, "curved on both sides", frequently used by Homer; the same feature is described by [[Tacitus]] concerning the Germans.

Moreover, in the author's opinion, the Greek [[aoidos]] would be similar to the Old Norse [[skald]], as Homer would often make use of a figure of speech known as [[kenning]] in Nordic literature.

Also, some mythological figures would be similar in the two cultures (for example, [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] to the archer Ull in an Icelandic saga and to [[Hamlet]], main character of an ancient Danish legend reported in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''), as well as many divinities: [[Aphrodite]] corresponds with [[Freyja]], [[Ares]] with [[Thor]], [[Zeus]] with [[Wōden|Wotan]] and the [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]] (who come down on the battlefield to take the souls of dead warriors, with the [[Valkyries]]).

==Reactions to Vinci's theory==
The thesis presented in the book, according to the author himself, is said to be just a hypothesis, that would nevertheless justify "the beginning of archeological researches in the areas mentioned above".

From the third edition (2002), the book has been introduced by a famous Italian Homeric scholar, Rosa Calzecchi Onesti. The theory is also supported by William Mullen, professor at [[Bard College]]. In 2007, specialists in several disciplines took part in an international convention in Toija, the place where the ancient Troy might have existed in Vinci's opinion, and claimed the necessity of exhaustive studies on the topic.

===Criticisms===
Still, most scholars reject Vinci's theories. Here are the main reasons of criticism:

*His thesis is not confirmed by convincing archeological proofs: as results from the excavation, the Baltic coasts were populated by [[Neolithic]] cultures, using ceramic crockery and not bronze objects, at the time suggested by Vinci. The Scandinavian [[Bronze Age]], in fact, began later.{{Cn|date=May 2015}}
*Homeric poems have been subjected to probably deep variations during the centuries of oral transmission. Several expressions, typical of oral tradition, are thought to have developed when the poems were first written down, mingled with others representing a previous age. Therefore, it is impossible to ascribe the current Homeric texts to a precise historical period.&lt;ref name="loptson"&gt;Peter Loptson, in ''Nordicum-Mediterraneum. Icelandic E-Journal of Nordic and Mediterranean Studies'', 5,1 ([http://nome.unak.is/joomla/index.php/5-1/4-reviews51/237-giacomo-tripodi-ed-iliad-and-odyssey-in-the-north-of-europe-proceedings-of-the-workshop-toija-and-the-roots-of-european-civilisation-toija-finland-august-10th-2007-messina-armando-siciliano-editore-2009 online text] in English).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Homeric toponyms are compared with the current or medieval Baltic ones, on the basis that they have not undergone variations during the oral transmission period. In addition, the discovered affinities in the book usually rest on simple assonances, without a real correspondence with the phonological processes of the concerned languages. For instance, if the word Τροία ("Troy") had been assimilated in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], it would be something like ''Roija'' and not ''Toija''. Finnish does not admit more than one consonant in the first syllable of a word: while adapting foreign words to its own peculiarities, it tends to keep the [[liquid consonant]] [r] rather than the occlusives (for example, the German word ''strand'', "beach", is maintained in Finnish as ''ranta''.&lt;ref name=loptson /&gt;)
*Some localities described by Homer, in particular the farthest ones from the Greek world, such as in many others literary works, would not be close reports to reality, but fantasy inventions.&lt;ref name=loptson /&gt;
*Even on the basis that all Homeric localities correspond with a real place, studies have been pursued which show there are actually precise and systematic similarities between the world depicted in the [[Odyssey]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], not only regarding the physical conformation, but even in the kind and direction of the winds. By and large, mistakes (such as identifying [[Ithaca]] as the most western island in its archipelago) would recur in a limited number and would often be explicable.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Cuisenier, ''Le Périple d'Ulysse'', 2003, Fayard, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The first Italian edition of the book was published in 1995, the second, readjusted and expanded, in 1998, the third in 2002, the fourth in 2004 and the fifth in 2008. The book was also translated into English (Felice Vinci, ''The Baltic Origins of Homer's Epic Tales. The Iliad, the Odyssey and the Migration of Myth'', translation by Amalia De Francesco, 2006), [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].

'''James Edwin Thorold Rogers''' (23 March 1823 – 14 October 1890), known as '''Thorold Rogers''', was an English economist, historian and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] from 1880 to 1886. He deployed historical and statistical methods to analyse some of the key economic and social questions in [[Victorian England]].  As an advocate of free trade and social justice he distinguished himself from some others within the [[English historical school of economics|English Historical School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/enghist.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417022659/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/enghist.htm |date=17 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorold Rogers, ''The Economic Interpretation of History: Lectures Delivered at Worchester College Hall, Oxford, 1887-8'' (1891).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and formative years==
Rogers was born at [[West Meon]], Hampshire&lt;ref name =DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Rogers, James Edwin Thorold}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of George Vining Rogers and his wife Mary Ann Blyth, daughter of John Blyth. He was educated at [[King's College London]] and [[Magdalen Hall, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Debrett&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/debrettshouseo1886londuoft#page/132/mode/2up |title=Debrett's House of Commons |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking a first-class degree in 1846, he received his [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1849 from Magdalen and was ordained. A High Church man, he was curate of St. Paul's in [[Oxford]], and acted voluntarily as assistant curate at Headington from 1854 to 1858, until his views changed and he turned to politics. Rogers was instrumental in obtaining the [[Clerical Disabilities Relief Act]], of which he was the first beneficiary, becoming the first man to legally withdraw from his clerical vows in 1870.

For some time the classics were the chief field of his activity. He devoted himself to classical and philosophical tuition in Oxford with success, and his publications included an edition of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Ethics'' (in 1865).

==Anecdotes==
[[File:James Edwin Thorold Rogers - Caricature.jpg|thumb|left|Rogers caricature by [[Leslie Ward]] from Vanity Fair]]
The Victorian journalist [[George W. E. Russell]] (1953–1919) relates an exchange between Rogers and [[Benjamin Jowett]] (''Fifteen Chapters of Autobiography'', 1914, 111–2) :

'Another of our Professors – J. E. Thorold Rogers – though perhaps scarcely a celebrity, was well known outside Oxford, partly because he was the first person to relinquish the clerical character under the Act of 1870, partly because of his really learned labours in history and economics, and partly because of his Rabelaisian humour. He was fond of writing sarcastic epigrams, and of reciting them to his friends, and this habit produced a characteristic retort from Jowett. Rogers had only an imperfect sympathy with the historians of the new school, and thus derided the mutual admiration of Green and Freeman —

"Where, ladling butter from a large tureen,
See blustering Freeman butter blundering Green."

To which Jowett replied, in his quavering treble, "That's a false antithesis, Rogers. It's quite possible to bluster and blunder, too!"'

==Political economy==
Simultaneously with these occupations he had been studying economics. He became the first Tooke Professor of Statistics and Economic Science at [[King's College London]], from 1859 until his death. During this time he also held the [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy|Drummond professorship]] of political economy at [[All Souls College, Oxford]] between 1862 and 1867, when [[Bonamy Price]] was elected in his stead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/28/3/364 |author=N. B. DeMarchi|title=On the Early Dangers of Being Too Political an Economist|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|volume=28|pages=364–380|accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2662895|author=Salim Rashid|title=The Price-Rogers Election; Politics or Religion?|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|volume=30|date=July 1978|pages=310–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this he became a friend and follower of [[Richard Cobden]], an advocate for free trade, non-intervention in Europe and an end to imperial expansion, whom he met during his first tenure as Drummond professor.  Rogers said of Cobden, "he knew that ... political economy ... was, or ought to be, eminently inductive, and that an economist without facts is like an engineer without materials or tools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Cobden, Speeches on Questions of Public Policy by Richard Cobden, Front Matter |website= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rogers had a wealth of facts at his disposal:  his most influential works were the 6-volume ''History of Agriculture and Prices in England from 1259 to 1795'' and ''Six Centuries of Work and Wages''; he spent 20 years collecting facts for the latter work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Literary Gossip|journal=The Week : a Canadian journal of politics, literature, science and arts|date=13 March 1884|volume=1|issue=15|page=238|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n120/mode/1up|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as [[List of Presidents of Co-operative Congress|President]] of the first day of the 1875 [[Co-operative Congress]].&lt;ref name=PDF&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress Presidents 1869–2002|url=http://archive.co-op.ac.uk/downloadFiles/congressPresidentstable.pdf|format=PDF|website=Archive.co-op.ac.uk|date=February 2002|accessdate=10 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528100558/http://archive.co-op.ac.uk/downloadFiles/congressPresidentstable.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]] in 1880 and held the seat until it was divided under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]] he was elected MP for [[Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Bermondsey]] and held the seat until 1886. Rogers also lectured in political economy at [[Worcester College, Oxford]] in 1883 and was re-elected Drummond professor in 1888.

'''''Tractatus coislinianus''''' is an ancient Greek manuscript outlining a theory of [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] in the tradition of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

==Dramatic theory==
The ''Tractatus'' states that comedy invokes laughter and pleasure, thus purging those emotions ([[catharsis]]), in a manner parallel to the description of [[tragedy]] in the ''Poetics''. It proceeds to describe the devices used and manner in which [[catharsis]] is brought about.

==History==
The manuscript now resides in [[Paris, France]], at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]]; it is labeled "Coislinianus 120". The 10th-century manuscript resided at [[Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]]. In 1643, [[Athanasius Rhetor]] sent it from [[Cyprus]] to [[Pierre Séguier|Séguier de Coislin]]. The classicist [[J. A. Cramer]], poring through the collection of [[Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin]], was struck by the content, believing it to be the work of a commentator on Aristotle's theory of comedy, and published it in 1839. This belief was soon derided, but it has gained force in the 20th century; [[Richard Janko]] has argued that it is the notes or sketches of the lost second section of the ''Poetics''. Nesselrath argues that it is a later work, perhaps by [[Theophrastus]].

'''Walter Ullmann''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (29 November 1910 in [[Pulkau]] – 18 January 1983 in [[Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walter Ullmann Is Dead at 72; Was Scholar on Middle Ages|date=22 January 1983|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Austrian-[[Jewish]] scholar, who settled in the United Kingdom after leaving Austria in the late 1930s. He was a recognised authority on [[medieval]] [[political thought]], and in particular legal theory, an area in which he published prolifically.

==Life==
Ullmann was the son of a doctor. He attended the classical languages school in Horn and studied law at Vienna and Innsbruck. Having a non-Aryan grandfather made it dangerous for him to remain in Austria, so he left for England in 1939 and took up a position at Ratcliffe College, a Roman Catholic boarding school in Leicestershire.

In 1940 he enlisted. He served for three years, first in the [[Royal Pioneer Corps]] and then in the [[Royal Engineers]], before being discharged due to ill health.

After the war he had positions at the [[University of Leeds]], and then from 1949 at the [[University of Cambridge]], becoming a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He became [[Professor of Medieval History (Cambridge)|Professor of Medieval History]] at Cambridge in 1972, retiring in 1978.

Notable people who studied under Ullman include Prof. [[Janet Nelson]] and Prof. [[Rosamond McKitterick]].

Ullmann principally concerned himself with the history of thought in the mediaeval period and the history of the Papacy in the Middle Ages. His most successful book was ''The Growth of Papal Government in the Middle Ages'', which deals with the relationship between secular and ecclesiastical power in medieval times. Innsbruck University awarded him an honorary doctorate in political science.

Competition over the control of the silver mines in [[Potosí]], Lípez and Chichas surged in the early 17th century, pitting Basques and Vicuñas against each other.&lt;ref name="go"/&gt; The Vicuñas had initially employed legal and political measures attempting to block the Basque attempts to monopolize control over the Cabildo (municipal government) of Potosí and the silver mining sector. However, these efforts did not yield results. Violent incidents began in 1615, and escalated in 1622 following the assassination of a Basque of a street in Potosí.&lt;ref name = "po"&gt;Cole, Jeffrey A. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sEQG2ziLSUMC&amp;pg=PA50 The Potosí Mita, 1573–1700: Compulsory Indian Labor in the Andes]''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1985. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ba"/&gt;

The Vicuñas were led by Antonio Xeldres.&lt;ref name="do"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Spanish| last1 = Navarro Viola | first1 = Miguel | title = La Revista de Buenos Aires: Historia Americana, literatura y derecho. Periǒdico destinado á la República Argentina, la oriental del Uruguay y del Paraguay | first2 = Vicente G | last2 = Quesada | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e2dFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA347 | journal = La Revista de Buenos Aires: Historia Americana, Literatura y Derecho. Periodico Destinado a la República Argentina, la Oriental del Uruguay y del Paraguay | volume = 7 | place = Buenos Aires | year = 1865 | page = 347}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The creole, Mestizo and indigenous populations largely sided with the Vicuñas.&lt;ref name="go"/&gt; The Vicuñas themselves were not always unified, though, as they suffered from internal feuds between Andalusians on one hand and New Castillians and Extremadurans on the other (the former group eventually withdrew from the rebellion).&lt;ref name="phd"/&gt;

The war pitted different sectors of the viceregal administration against each other, as some supported the Basque claims for hegemony whilst others had a conciliatory approach to the Vicuña rebels. Personalities involved in the conflict included the president and oidores of the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]], treasury officials and the corregidor of Potosí and the visitador (sent to the area in order to audit fiscal accounts).&lt;ref name="phd"/&gt;

The Vicuña rebels had killed 64 men by March 1624. However, the Basque control over the city and the mines had not been broken. Basque leaders pleaded to the King of Spain, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], to intervene. The King in return ordered the [[Viceroy of Peru]] to act decisively against the Vicuñas.&lt;ref name= "ba"/&gt; Between 1624 and 1625, the viceregal authorities managed to capture several key Vicuña leaders, executing forty of them.&lt;ref name="phd"/&gt;

The war would last for three years. The war did not end in any decisive victory for any side, but rather as a result of mutual exhaustion.&lt;ref name="po"/&gt; An agreement to end hostilities was reached.&lt;ref name="do"&gt;Douglass, William A., and Jon Bilbao. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8KzfK1QwxDIC&amp;pg=PA82 Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World]''. Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2005, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;  The marriage between the children of two of the leaders of the opposing camps, the son of the Basque leader Francisco Oyanume and the daughter of the Vicuña general Castillo, was part of the settlement of the conflict.&lt;ref name="ba"/&gt; In April 1625, a royal decree was issued, pardoning all Vicuñas fighters except those having committed blood crimes.&lt;ref name="ba"&gt;Azcona Pastor, José Manuel, and William A. Douglass. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eiqFIaY0LpEC&amp;pg=PA208 Possible Paradises: Basque Emigration to Latin America]''. Reno, NV: Univ. of Nevada Press, 2004, pp. 208–9&lt;/ref&gt; Some Vicuñas continued acts of banditry in the following years, but without the ethnic or political overtones as during the war with the Basques.&lt;ref name= "do"/&gt; Basque-Vicuña rivalry did, however, continue for a century.&lt;ref name ="go"/&gt;

On March 15, 1626, the ingenios of Potosí were destroyed by massive flooding. This event was interpreted as a divine punishment for the past violences.&lt;ref name="phd"/&gt;

Later histiography has sought to emphasize the socio-economic contradictions as catalysts for the war, framing it as class warfare.&lt;ref name="phd"/&gt;

{{Chinese name|[[Xie (surname)|Xie]]}}
'''Xie Bingying''' ({{Zh|s=谢冰莹|t=謝冰瑩|p=Xiè Bīngyíng|w=Hsieh Ping-ying}}; September 5, 1906 – January 5, 2000), was originally born as '''Xie Minggang''' ({{Zh|c=|s=谢鸣岗|t=謝鳴崗|p=Xie Minggang}}), and her courtesy name is '''Fengbao''' ({{Zh|c=|s=风宝|t=風寶|p=Fengbao}}). She was a Chinese soldier and writer, most well-known for her autobiographies of her life as a soldier in the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist Army]].

==Early life==
She was born in [[Xinhua County|Xinhua]], [[Loudi]], [[Hunan]] in 1906. Her father was a scholar and she had three siblings: one older sister and three older brothers. Following the traditions and customs of the time, Xie's parents had betrothed her to the son of a family friend, Xiao Ming ({{Zh|c=|s=萧明|t=蕭明|p=Xiao Ming}}), at the age of three. Although her mother originally bound her feet, she rebelled against this practice and did not continue with her bindings after she went to school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRW5zjWTKeAC&amp;dq=isbn:0231122500&amp;q=born#v=snippet&amp;q=brother&amp;f=false|title=A Woman Soldier's Own Story: The Autobiography of Xie Bingying|last=Xie|first=Bingying|date=2017-04-19|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9780231122504|location=|pages=x-xvi|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She entered school in 1916, and was the only girl in a private boys' school in her village. In 1918, she was accepted into the Datong Girls School in [[Changsha|Changsha city]], and according to her autobiographies, she was only allowed to attend after she threatened suicide. However, from there she bounced around schools in Hunan; first the Xinhua County Girls School in 1919, and then the Xinyi Girls School in [[Yiyang]] in 1920 (where she was expelled for political activism), and finally the Changsha First Provincial Girls Teacher Training School, also in 1920. In 1926, she joined the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]]'s [[Republic of China Military Academy|Central Military and Political Academy]] in [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] (also known as the Whampoa Military Academy), which was a training facility for [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] soldiers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Soldier and Writer ==
Along with many other young women, Xie joined the Nationalist Revolutionary Army in a bout of patriotic and revolutionary fervor. She participated in the [[Northern Expedition]] of 1926, and was particularly active in the propaganda units. It was at this time that she started her autobiographical works, and segments of her writings (which were formatted as letters in a diary) were published in the Nationalist Party newspaper, the ''Central Daily News,'' in 1927. Her literary reputation started with her military diaries and letters, some of which were translated into English by [[Lin Yutang]] and published first serially in 1927 and then in book form in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Yutang. ''Letters of a Chinese Amazon and Wartime Essays''. Shanghai: The Commercial Press, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When "I" Was Born: Women's Autobiography in Modern China|last=Wang|first=Jing M.|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-299-22510-0|location=Madison|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[Shanghai massacre|Nationalist purge of the Communists in 1927]], her regiment was disbanded and she returned to her hometown. While at home, her parents wanted to proceed with her arranged marriage to Xiao Ming, and she was virtually imprisoned until she was married and crossed the threshold of her husband's home. In her autobiographies, she notes that her husband respected her wishes to not consummate their marriage and to consider an annulment. For a short while, she resigned herself to domestic chores and duties, until she was offered a teaching position at the Datong Girls School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_Warriors_and_Wartime_Spies_of_Chin.html?id=jJY1jgEACAAJ|title=Women Warriors and Wartime Spies of China|last=Edwards|first=Louise|date=2016-04-07|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107146037|location=|pages=70|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, her parents-in-law allowed her to leave the family home in order to take up the teaching job at Datong Girls School. However, instead Xie moved to [[Hengyang]] to teach grade school, and then to [[Shanghai]]. In Shanghai, she enrolled in the Chinese literature department of the [[Shanghai Academy of Art]] where she developed her writing skills. It was at this time that she published ''War Diary'' ({{Zh|c=|s=从军日记|t=從軍日記|p=Congjun riji}}), which was a collection of her experiences on the front lines during the Northern Expedition, and included the articles originally published in the ''Central Daily News.'' She mainly lived off the royalties of this work while she studied at the Shanghai Academy of Art.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRW5zjWTKeAC&amp;dq=isbn:0231122500&amp;q=born#v=snippet&amp;q=prison&amp;f=false|title=A Woman Soldier's Own Story: The Autobiography of Xie Bingying|last=Xie|first=Bingying|date=2017-04-19|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9780231122504|location=|pages=200|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_Warriors_and_Wartime_Spies_of_Chin.html?id=jJY1jgEACAAJ|title=Women Warriors and Wartime Spies of China|last=Edwards|first=Louise|date=2016-04-07|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107146037|location=|pages=71|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after 1929 she was the person credited with naming the young actress [[Wang Ying (actress)|Wang Ying]].

However, by 1929, the government of the Shanghai [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]] forced the Shanghai Academy of Art to close. Fortunately, her older brother sent her money to move to [[Beijing]] and take supplementary courses so that she could eventually enroll in the Woman's Normal University in Tianjin. She passed the entrance examination and enrolled in the University by 1930. It was during this time that she entered into a common-law marriage with an ex-army comrade, Fu Hao ({{Zh|c=|s=符号|t=符號|p=Fu Hao}}), with whom she had a daughter. Unfortunately, Fu Hao was arrested in 1930 because of his left-wing political views and Xie was forced to flee as well to avoid arrest by the Beijing government. She eventually left her daughter in the care of Fu's mother and went to Japan to continue her studies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_Warriors_and_Wartime_Spies_of_Chin.html?id=jJY1jgEACAAJ|title=Women Warriors and Wartime Spies of China|last=Edwards|first=Louise|date=2016-04-07|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107146037|location=|pages=72|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was not in Japan for long and returned to Shanghai in 1931. During this time, she served as the editor of ''Women's Light'', a weekly newspaper, and joined the Shanghai Writers Association of National Salvation to Resist Japan. Her writings at this time were strongly supportive of the Chinese troops fighting against the Japanese during the [[January 28 Incident|Shanghai Incident of 1932]], and she tried to rally other writers in Shanghai towards this cause. She traveled around writing, teaching, and publishing in [[Fujian]] and [[Hunan]], until she returned to Japan in 1935. This time, when she went to Japan she was arrested and imprisoned for three weeks because she refused to welcome [[Puyi]] and acknowledge the Japanese-controlled state of [[Manchukuo]] in Northeastern China. After she was released, she returned to China and completed her second book in 1936, entitled ''A Woman Soldier's Own Story (''{{Zh|c=|s=一个女兵的自传|t=一個女兵的自傳|p=}}). She would publish an account of her experiences as a prisoner in 1940, in a book entitled ''Inside a Japanese Prison'' ({{Zh|c=|s=在日本狱中|t=在日本獄中|p=Zai Riben yuzhong}}'').''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRW5zjWTKeAC&amp;dq=isbn:0231122500&amp;q=born#v=snippet&amp;q=prison&amp;f=false|title=A Woman Soldier's Own Story: The Autobiography of Xie Bingying|last=Xie|first=Bingying|date=2017-04-19|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9780231122504|location=|pages=260|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_Warriors_and_Wartime_Spies_of_Chin.html?id=jJY1jgEACAAJ|title=Women Warriors and Wartime Spies of China|last=Edwards|first=Louise|date=2016-04-07|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107146037|location=|pages=73|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1937, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had commenced and Xie joined the war effort. She created the Hunan Women's War Zone Service Corps, which provided first aid on the front lines, and continued her work in propaganda. The Corps followed the Chinese troops as they retreated along to [[Yangtze|Yangzi River]] into [[Xi'an]]. By 1943, Xie had met and married Jia Yizhen ({{Zh|c=|s=贾伊箴|t=賈伊箴|p=Jia Yizhen}}), with whom she had a son and daughter. During this time she also edited the monthly magazine ''Huanghe,'' and published essays, fiction, and more autobiographical writings with various presses. In addition, she published the ''New War Diary'' ({{Zh|c=|s=新从军日记|t=新從軍日記|p=Xin congjun riji}}), which was an updated version of her previous ''War Diary''&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; in 1938.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1948, she left to teach at [[National Taiwan Normal University]] in [[Taipei]], and she never returned to mainland China. She later emigrated to the United States in 1974, and died in [[San Francisco]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
