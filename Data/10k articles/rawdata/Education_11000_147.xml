The '''2018 Oklahoma teachers' strike''' began on April 2, 2018, with teachers across the state walking out to protest low pay, overcrowded classrooms, and tax cuts that resulted in lower state-wide education spending. It was the first such action in Oklahoma since 1990.&lt;ref name=intercept&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/03/06/oklahoma-teacher-strike-west-virginia/|title=TEACHER UNREST SPREADS TO OKLAHOMA, WHERE EDUCATORS ARE “DESPERATE FOR A SOLUTION”|last=Cohen|first=Rachel|date=6 March 2018|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OEA declared an end to the strike on April&amp;nbsp;12 after an agreement to increase salaries and state funding for education was reached. The call to end the strike faced some objection from teachers and parents who do not believe that enough concessions were made by lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/arizona-teachers-vote-statewide-strike-180420075924512.html|title=US: Arizona teachers vote for first-ever statewide strike|date=20 April 2018|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[2018 West Virginia teachers' strike|similar action in West Virginia]], the strike was not a "[[wildcat strike action|wildcat]]" strike, as it received endorsement from union leadership, albeit only after pressure from teachers.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/teacher-strikes-are-spreading-across-america|title=Teacher Strikes Are Spreading Across America With No End in Sight|last=Eidelson|first=Josh|date=2 April 2018|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest occurred concurrent with similar protests in [[2018 Arizona teachers' strike|Arizona]], [[2018 Kentucky teachers' strike|Kentucky]], North Carolina, and [[2018 Colorado teachers' strike|Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-teachers-spending-20180402-story.html|title=Red-state revolt continues: Teachers strike in Oklahoma and protest in Kentucky|last=Pearce|first=Matt|date=2 April 2018|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===State of public education in Oklahoma===
Since 2008, education spending per student in Oklahoma has fallen 28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/striking-oklahoma-teachers-win-historic-school-funding-increase-and-keep-on-marching|title=Striking Oklahoma Teachers Win Historic School-Funding Increase and Keep On Marching|last=DenHoed|first=Andrea|date=4 April 2018|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the decrease in funding, twenty percent of schools run on four-day weeks, and many have eliminated art and language classes and shut down sports programs.&lt;ref name=okturn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/03/oklahoma-teachers-strike-west-virginia|title=It’s Oklahoma’s Turn to Strike|last=Blanc|first=Eric|date=30 March 2018|publisher=Jacobin|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gains from last teachers' strike in Oklahoma, in 1990, which resulted in an agreement to lower class sizes, expand kindergarten programs, and increase teacher wages were later reversed due to budget cuts.&lt;ref name=okturn/&gt; The decline in funding and subsequent decline in the quality of public education has resulted in the expansion of [[charter schools]] in the state.&lt;ref name=okturn/&gt;

===Plans for a strike===
Support for a strike began to build in early March of 2018, after a proposal (dubbed the "Step Up" plan) failed to pass. The "Step Up" plan would have increased certain taxes and boosted teacher pay by $5,000.&lt;ref name=intercept/&gt; Both Democrats and Republicans voted against the bill. Some Democrats voted against as the plan did not go far enough to restore funding.

Plans for a strike beginning on April 2 were first floated in March. On April 2, schools throughout Oklahoma were scheduled to take standardized tests; preventing these tests from taking place could potentially jeopardize millions in federal funds allocated to Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=intercept/&gt; After Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin passed a limited budget increase on Friday, March 30, a strike beginning on the 2nd was announced.

==Strike==
The strike lasted from April 2nd to April 12th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/04/teachers-strikes-oklahoma-socialism-sanders-unions|title=Red Oklahoma|last=Blanc|first=Eric|date=13 April 2018|publisher=Jacobin|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/oklahoma-teachers-strike.html|title=Oklahoma Teachers End Walkout After Winning Raises and Additional Funding|last=Goldstein|first=Dana|date=12 April 2018|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers won greater school funding and salary increases, funded in part by taxes on tobacco sales, online shopping, and fracking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/08/teachers-strikes-oklahoma-gop-primaries-house-2018-elections.html|title=Oklahoma Teachers Just Purged the Statehouse of Their Enemies|last=Levitz|first=Eric|date=29 August 2018|publisher=Daily Intelligencer|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other miscellaneous taxes. Strike leaders had called for the introduction of a capital gains tax to avoid a regressive tax, but the terms were nevertheless accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://splinternews.com/teachers-win-again-in-oklahoma-as-strike-ends-1825235623|title=Teachers Win Again in Oklahoma as Strike Ends|last=Chang|first=Clio|date=13 April 2018|publisher=Splinter|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salary demands===
Teacher salaries in Oklahoma are the lowest in the United States, resulting in some teachers and staffers working second or third jobs.&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=okturn/&gt; An initial offer of a $6,000 wage increase, ratified by the governor, was rejected, as the initial demands were for a $10,000 raise for teachers and a $1250 raise for support staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://splinternews.com/oklahoma-is-the-latest-red-state-where-teachers-are-ris-1824260223|title=Oklahoma Is the Latest Red State Where Teachers Are Rising Up|last=Osberg|first=Molly|date=2 April 2018|publisher=Splinter|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions from state officials==
Governor [[Mary Fallin]] likened teacher demands to "...teenager(s) wanting a better car”.&lt;ref name=thehill&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/381781-oklahoma-teachers-jingle-keys-chant-wheres-my-car-at-governor|title=Oklahoma teachers jingle keys, chant ‘Where’s my car?’ at governor|last=Gstalter|first=Morgan|date=5 April 2018|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quote was appropriated by teachers and used in chants during protests at the [[Oklahoma State Capitol]]. 

State representative Kevin McDugle, a Republican, indicated he would not pass any bill or measure to increase education spending due to the protests undertaken by the teachers.

==2018 primary season==
Ten Republican representatives who opposed to tax raise to increase teacher salaries were up for re-election in 2018. Two, Scott McEachin and Chuck Strohm, were eliminated by other Republican nominees during the initial primary, while a further seven did not gain enough votes to win their primaries uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/08/29/oklahoma-arizona-primary-teachers/|title=IN OKLAHOMA AND ARIZONA, PRIMARY VOTERS REWARDED CANDIDATES WHO STOOD WITH TEACHERS|last=Jilani|first=Zaid|date=29 August 2018|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seven faced runoff elections in August 2018, and six lost.

==History==

===Early developments===
[[File:Aarhus Universitets hovedbygning set fra parken.jpg|thumb|View of The Main Building overlooking the University Park. The building was finished in 1946 and holds the university assembly hall.]]
Aarhus University was founded on 11 September 1928 as ''Universitetsundervisningen i Jylland'' ("University Studies in [[Jutland]]") with a budget of 33,000 [[Danish krone|Dkr]] and an enrollment of 64 students, which rose to 78 during the first semester. The university was founded as a response to the increasing number of students at the [[University of Copenhagen]] after [[World War I]]. Classrooms were rented from the Technical College and the teaching corps consisted of one professor of philosophy and four associate professors of Danish, English, German and French. Along with ''Universitets-Samvirket'' ("The University Association") which consisted of representatives of Aarhus' businesses, organisations and institutions, the municipality of Aarhus had fought since 1921 to have Denmark's next university located in the city.&lt;ref name="au-history"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.au.dk/en/about/profile/history/history/ | title = History of The University of Aarhus | accessdate = 2012-07-08 | last = Trefzer | first = Sandra | date = 3 Oct 2011 | publisher = Aarhus University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSD-au"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Erhverv%2C_karriere_og_ledelse/P%C3%A6dagogik_og_uddannelse/Danske_universiteter/Aarhus_Universitet | title = Aarhus Universitet | accessdate = 2012-07-08 | author = Gyldendal | work = Den Store Danske | publisher = [[Gyldendal]] | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the municipality of Aarhus gave the university land with a landscape of rolling hills.&lt;ref name="DSD-au" /&gt; The design of the university buildings and 12 ha campus area was assigned to architects [[C. F. Møller]], [[Kay Fisker]] and [[Povl Stegmann]], who won the architectural competition in 1931. Construction of the first buildings began a year later, but the campus was developed in stages and is still under development {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Since 1939, [[C. F. Møller Architects]] has been responsible for the architectural design of Aarhus University in accordance with the original [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] design key, perhaps best exemplified by the characteristic yellow brick and tile.

The first buildings was finished in 1933 and housed the Departments of Chemistry, Physics and Anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/showroom/galleri/lokaliteterogbygninger/aarhusuniversitetsfoerstebygning/|title=Aarhus Universitets første bygning [The first building of Aarhus University] |publisher=Aarhus University|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These departments later moved to newer buildings at the campus and the original building complex now house Department of Psychology and Department of Political Science. The construction of the first stage was funded solely by donations which totaled 935,000 Dkr and the buildings covered an area of 4,190m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Albeck163"&gt;{{Harvnb|Albeck|1978|pp=163–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most generous contributors to the first stage was ''De Forenede Teglværker i Aarhus'' ("The United Tileworks of Aarhus") led by director K. Nymark. ''Forenede Teglværker'' decided to donate 1 million yellow bricks and tiles worth c. 50,000 Dkr and later decided to extend the donation to all bricks needed.&lt;ref name="Faber62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inauguration on 11 September 1933, marked the first official use of the name Aarhus University and was celebrated in a tent on campus, attended by [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X]], [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen Alexandrine]], their son [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederick]] and [[Thorvald Stauning|Prime Minister Stauning]] together with 1000 invited guests.&lt;ref name="Faber6364"&gt;{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 1934, Aarhus University was given permission to hold examinations by the king and on 10 October 1935, Professor Dr. phil. Ernst Frandsen was appointed the first rector of the university.&lt;ref name="Faber67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortages of materials and a stressed economy, postponed and delayed further development of Aarhus University. In 1941, construction of The Main Building (''Hovedbygningen'') commenced, a complex to house the university aula (assembly hall) and canteen among academic and administrative purposes. The stringent minimalist and uncompromising functionalistic design of the first university buildings from 1933 had stirred some local dissatisfaction and it was decided that The Main Building should possess more traditional romantic and [[Neoclassical architecture|classical architectural]] inspirations - although in agreement with the original architectural plan -, and also make use of more lavish and expensive materials. The Main Building was finished in 1946 and still stands out from the rest of the University campus as somewhat different in its architectural design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/showroom/galleri/lokaliteterogbygninger/hovedbygningen/|title=Hovedbygningen (indviet 1946) |publisher=Aarhus University|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison with the original 4,190m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; floor space of the first buildings, Aarhus University now holds a floor space of 246,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the University Park alone.&lt;ref name="Albeck163" /&gt; A series of buildings outside the main campus adds an additional floor space of 59,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="au-history" /&gt;

===Faculties===

From 1928, Aarhus University offered courses in languages and philosophy, but the students were unable to finish their studies without going to the University of Copenhagen for their final examinations. By request of the Ministry of Education, the Teachers' Association made a draft of how to conduct the final examinations in the humanistic subjects in Aarhus and in the draft, the Association proposed that the faculty was named the Faculty of Humanities by analogy with the corresponding faculties in [[Uppsala]], [[Lund]] and [[Turku]]. After negotiations between the faculties in Aarhus and Copenhagen, the King declared on 8 May 1935 that the final university examinations could be held at the Faculty of Philosophy in Copenhagen as well as at the Faculty of Humanities in Aarhus. This was the first final examinations Aarhus University was allowed to hold, but on 24 July 1936 the king granted the Faculty of Humanities the right to hold examinations for the [[Cand.mag.|magister]] degree and in 1940 for the [[PhD]].&lt;ref name="au-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Faber74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus University had offered courses in basic medical subjects from 1933 and on 10 October 1935 the Faculty of Medicine was formally established.&lt;ref name="Albeck265"&gt;{{Harvnb|Albeck|1978|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a Faculty of Medicine in Aarhus was met with some opposition from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Copenhagen. The professors thought that the state should not establish a new Faculty until the shortcomings of the old one had been solved. In the end, the professors agreed to sign a recommendation for the new Faculty as long as improvements to the old one were not delayed.&lt;ref name="Faber52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1953, the Faculty of Medicine had been fully built, complete with lectures, professorship chairs, final exams, research facilities and the hospitals of Aarhus had been expanded to meet the demands of clinical training.&lt;ref name="Albeck266267"&gt;{{Harvnb|Albeck|1978|pp=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the Faculty of Medicine merged with the dental school and changed its name to Faculty of Health Sciences.&lt;ref name="au-history" /&gt;

The university established its Faculty of Economics and Law in 1936, but when it offered courses in political science and in psychology (1959 and 1968, respectively), the faculty changed its name to the Faculty of Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="au-history" /&gt; The faculty had to be funded solely on private donations and once the university demonstrated it had the needed financial means, the Minister of Education recommended the Finance Committee to approve the establishment of the faculty on 27 January 1936 since the state did not have to grant financial support. The Committee approved and by declaration of the king on 5 November 1937, the faculty could hold examinations in economics and law.&lt;ref name="Faber95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses had been offered in theology since 1932 at the Faculty of Humanities, but in 1942 the Faculty of Theology was formally established.&lt;ref name="DSD-au" /&gt; Already on 22 June 1928, [[Reverend]] Balslev of Aarhus had proposed that Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus (not yet university) taught basic courses in theology. Though the proposal was greeted by the management, the Faculty of Theology in Copenhagen pointed out that it would take 3 full-time teachers of the [[New Testament]], [[Old Testament]] and [[History of Christianity|ecclesiastical history]], respectively as well as education in [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] by the Faculty of Humanities. At this time, Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus did not have the financial means to meet these criteria so the case was shelved for the time being. In April 1931, the case reopened, this time by [[Bishop]] Skat Hoffmeyer who proposed free teaching in the required subjects. The management asked the faculty in Copenhagen if this was acceptable, but because the teaching was free, the faculty saw it as tutoring rather than actual teaching and they neither approved or disproved of such an approach though they did not see it as actual university teaching. The municipality of Aarhus did not aid with funds and the management deemed a request of the state to be futile so they decided to disregard getting the teaching approved and start it anyway under the supervision of Skat Hoffmeyer. On 5 September 1932 Reverend Asmund held the first lecture in theology. This private education in theology continued until the university could hire its own professors in 1938, and in 1942 Aarhus University could at long last establish the Faculty of Theology.&lt;ref name="au-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Faber99105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|pp=99–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The main building and World War II===
{{See also|Aarhus Air Raid}}

[[File:Buerne mod parken 2.jpg|thumb|The brick [[colonnade]]s]]
In 1938, the university management acknowledged it was time to consider an expansion due to lack of space and overcrowding of the auditoriums. The solution was The Main Building (''Hovedbygningen''), containing both rooms and facilities for new academic areas, as well as housing for the general administration, an assembly hall and a canteen. The building was to be organized according to a principle of institutes so that teaching and research took place in certain rooms with their own library and study for the professor.&lt;ref name="Faber114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|pp=114–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aarhus Universitet - mindetavle.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial in the main building to honour the ten victims of the 1944 air strike and the two workers killed during construction in 1941.]]
[[File:Aulaen (klaver).jpg|thumb|Detail from the Aula, with specially designed lamps and furniture.]]
The construction of the building took place during the [[Occupation of Denmark|German occupation of Denmark]] (1940–45) in [[World War II]], which affected the process in more than one way. No state funds had been involved in the construction of the first university building and a second building for [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], and a [[high voltage]] laboratory, but because the [[Nazism|Nazis]] were against civil use of materials and work forces, the state contributed to the main building. In 1943, the [[Gestapo]], [[Sicherheitsdienst]], [[Geheime Feldpolizei]] and [[Abwehr]] set up their regional headquarters in the five student halls of residence on campus. Fearing that the same would happen to the new main building, its completion was delayed. C. F. Møller later wrote that for once there was plenty of time to work on the details of the building, like patterned brickwork, acoustic screens and furniture.&lt;ref name="Møller4658"&gt;{{Harvnb|Møller|1978|pp=46–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fode103"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fode|2005|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furniture designer [[Aage Windeleff]], designed the furniture specially for the main building, while [[Børge Mogensen]]'s industrially produced furniture designs are the most commonly used elsewhere on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/showroom/web-udstillinger/moebler-ved-aarhus-universitet/|title=Møbler ved Aarhus Universitet [Furniture at Aarhus University] |publisher=Aarhus University|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the Gestapo in Aarhus led to multiple arrests of Danish resistance fighters and [[Danish resistance movement|the resistance movement]] soon realized they needed outside assistance. On 15 October, the leader of the illegal Danish underground army in Jutland, [[Niels Bennike]], sent the following telegram to [[London]]:&lt;ref name="Fode103" /&gt;
[[File:Aula (Aarhus Universitet).jpg|thumb|University Aula]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Undergrunden i Jyland ved at blive revet op af Gestapo. Vigtigere at få ødelagt arkiver og bevare vore folk end at bevare arkiver og få ødelagt vore folk. Jeg beder indtrængende om, at kollegium 4 og 5, gentager 4 og 5, må blive ødelagt ved luftangreb. Det er de to vestligste, gentager vestligste, bygninger i universitetskomplekset. Haster, gentager haster.&lt;br /&gt;
("Underground in Jutland getting torn up by the Gestapo. More important to get the archives destroyed and save our people than getting our people destroyed and save the archives. I implore that residence hall 4 and 5, repeat 4 and 5, be destroyed by air strike. They are the two farthest to the west, repeat farthest to the west, buildings of the university complex. Urgent, repeat urgent.")
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 31 October 1944, the [[Royal Air Force]] bombed the Gestapo's headquarters in residence halls 4 and 5, also killing ten civilian workers. [[No. 2 Group RAF|2 Group Bomber Command]] carried out the bombing by using 25 [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito planes]]. The air strike on the University of Aarhus took place in a heavily populated area and the campus was surrounded by three hospitals. To avoid civilian casualties, the RAF prepared with a model of the campus, shooting at residence halls 4 and 5 with chalk bags. The architect C. F. Møller was in the main building during the air strike but survived and was later dug free from the rubble. The reconstructed main building opened on 11 September 1946.&lt;ref name="Faber114" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Møller4658" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fode102109"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fode|2005|pp=102–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1970===
Aarhus University was an independent institution until 1970, but with management representatives from the city council and the organization of Universitets-Samvirket. Hereafter, the university became a state-run institution under the first University Act. With the next University Act in 1992, external organizations were once again represented in the administration and under the 2003 Act, all Danish universities are governed by a nationwide university board. This board appoints the rector, deans and heads of departments instead of the students. It commenced in January 2004 for the first time and in August 2005, it appointed a new rector.&lt;ref name="au-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DSD-au" /&gt;

In 1994, the university was a [[Aarhus University shooting|scene of a shooting]]; 3 people (including the perpetrator) were killed and two more were injured.

Aarhus University has hosted significant musical events. The [[Grateful Dead]] played there on April 16, 1972; the recorded performance was part of the group's Europe '72 tour.

In the current century, several higher education institutions have been merged with Aarhus University. Following the Danish University reform of 2006,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} it merged with the HIH{{clarify|date=March 2014}} in Herning and the DPU{{clarify|date=March 2014}} in Copenhagen, making the university nationwide and adding 6,000 students. In 2012, Aarhus University's School of Engineering was merged with the university proper, making it Denmark's largest.{{clarify|Denmark's largest what?|date=March 2014}}

==Campus==
[[File:Aarhus Universitet - Lake and library.jpg|thumb|The University Park]]
[[File:Vennelystparken (maj) 03.jpg|thumb|Vennelystparken, the southern section of the University Park.]]
Aarhus University's main campus is located in central Aarhus, encircling the [[University Park, Aarhus|University Park]] (''Universitetsparken'').

The campus master plan competition was won in 1931 by the collaborative scheme of Danish architects [[Kay Fisker]], [[C. F. Møller]] and [[Povl Stegmann]] in collaboration with landscape architect [[Carl Theodor Sørensen]]. The design includes a wide variety of buildings in a large area, but each building is constructed of the same yellow brick and roofing tile and with a common design key, providing the whole campus with a unified appearance. Construction commenced in 1932 and has continued into present times, lately in 1999-2001 (''Søauditorierne'') and 2014-17 (AU Health).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfmoller.com/p/-en/soeauditoriet-aarhus-universitet-i263.html |title=Auditoriums, University of Aarhus |publisher=C.F.

In a harmonic interplay with the park, the yellow buildings form a campus that has received international recognition for its aesthetic values and it has been protected by law since 1993, in order to conserve its unique design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arkitekturfortællinger - om Aarhus Universitets Bygninger|language=Danish|author=Olaf Lind and Poul Ib Henriksen|publisher=Aarhus University Press|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soap.plansystem.dk/pdfarchive/20_1117400_APPROVED_1242812291478.pdf|title=Lokalplan nr. 376 |at=Bevarende lokalplan for Universitetetsparken og Vennelystparken|language=da|author=Stadsarkitektens kontor|publisher=Århus Kommune|date=February 1993|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. F. Møller]] and his company, [[C. F. Møller Architects]] have continued as architects of the campus ever since, except the new department of AU Health currently under construction, designed by [[Cubo Architects|Cubo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.statsbiblioteket.dk|title=Statsbiblioteket|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park and campus has been expanded throughout the years, in 1957 the old park of [[Vennelystparken]], just south of the University park was included.

Apart from the main campus, Aarhus University has several smaller campuses and departments throughout Aarhus.&lt;ref name=campus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studerende.au.dk/studier/fagportaler/arts/campus/|title=Campus|publisher=Aarhus University|language=Danish|date=24 August 2015|accessdate= 8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the campus of [[Aarhus BSS]], school of business and social sciences in [[Aarhus V]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bss.au.dk/|title=Welcome to Aarhus BSS|publisher=Aarhus University|date=9 August 2015|accessdate= 8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new adjacent campus of Nobelparken, built in 1997-2004 in red brick, also by C. F. Møller Architects, but in a different design, a campus at [[Trøjborg]] for Nordic linguistics and related studies, and parts of the research park of IT-byen at [[Katrinebjerg]], where the computer science institute also teach and do research. [[Archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] takes residence in [[Moesgård Manor]], an old manor house at the new [[Moesgård Museum]].

Aarhus University also has a small campus in [[Emdrup]] in Copenhagen (approx. 6.000 students), where the university's programmes in education and pedagogy are taught and researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.au.dk/en|title=Danish School of Education|author=17928@au.dk|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is due for expansion by 2020, and the small Environmental Science Unit at Frederiksborgvej 399, [[Roskilde]] is due to move there. In the city of [[Herning]], there is also a small campus where a few of the university's business, engineering and technology programmes are taught, called the [[Department of Business Development and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auhe.au.dk/en/|title=Department of Business Development and Technology|author=223704@au.dk|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation and administration==
The university is governed by the University Board which has 11 members: six members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, two members are appointed by the academic staff, one member is appointed by the technical/administrative staff, and two members are appointed by the university students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.au.dk/en/about/uni/theaarhusuniversityboard | title= Aarhus University Board | accessdate= 2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance.

===Main academic areas===
Since 1 January 2011, the university has been organised into four major main academic areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/en/facultiesdepartmentsetc/organisation|title=Departments and Schools|author=136957@au.dk|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219171807/http://www.au.dk/en/facultiesdepartmentsetc/organisation/|archivedate=19 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014|October|1}}, more than 42,000 students were enrolled in Aarhus University.&lt;ref name="au.dk"/&gt; Each year more than 1000 international exchange students come to Aarhus University to study for one or two terms. In 2009 close to 3000 international students were enrolled in full degree programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/aarhusuniversitet/122/|title=AU profilbrochure 10-11 uk|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhus University is an international university with a large proportion of students at the post-baccalaureate level: over half of its students are enrolled in master's degree and PhD programmes.

The university's doctoral programmes allow talented students to enroll in a combined Master's/PhD programme either right after completing the bachelor's degree (the 3+5 track) or one year into their master's degree programme (the 4+4 track).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talent.au.dk/phd/applyforphdadmission/|title=PhD fellowships and scholarships|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006 the number of PhD students has risen from approximately 1000 to approximately 1700 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/nogletal/2010/tabelc1/|title=Tabel c1|author=274194@au.dk|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923180426/http://www.au.dk/om/profil/nogletal/2010/tabelc1/|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Centre===
The International Centre maintains international partnerships and combines a wide range of services for exchange students, international full-degree students, PhDs and visiting scholars. The International Centre is often the first stop for foreign students at Aarhus University, since the centre offers advice on finding housing and living in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/en/internationalcentre/|title=International Centre|author=287607@au.dk|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AU Summer University===
Starting in 2011 all summer courses and summer schools offered by Aarhus University for Bachelor's, Master's and PhD students will be gathered together and expanded to provide more diversity in a new framework: AU Summer University. In the summer of 2011 more than 80 courses were offered within the fields of humanities, theology, social sciences, health sciences, natural sciences, agricultural sciences, business and educational sciences. Summer courses are open to both Danish and international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/en/summeruniversity/ausummeruniversity/|title=AU Summer University|author=223698@au.dk|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree programmes===
Aarhus University has seen some deep administrational changes since the turn of the century and now also includes several large sub-departments such as [[Aarhus BSS]], [[AU Engineering]] and others. Each of these sub-departments offers [[undergraduate]] and/or [[Graduate school|graduate]] programmes specific to their own field of study. The core academic degree programmes of Aarhus University includes the following fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studieguide.au.dk/en/|title=Study guide|author=136957@au.dk|publisher=Aarhus University|date=8 May 2015|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheminova controversy and academic freedom at AU===
Since 1944, Aarhus University owned [[Cheminova]], a chemical manufacturer who among other controversies has been selling [[methyl parathion]] pesticide to Brazil farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.information.dk/163911 | title= ATP kræver kulegravning af Cheminova | date= 18 August 2008| accessdate= 2009-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, senior researcher Mette Jensen emailed her colleagues at AU, asking whether they thought Cheminova should stop selling the controversial pesticides. For this, the university threatened her with dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.information.dk/184755 | title= Universitet knægter ansats ytringsfrihed | date= 8 March 2009| accessdate= 2009-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's Pro-Vice-Chancellor Søren E. Frandsen denied that the university had made any mistakes or threatened the freedom of speech and academic freedom of its staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.information.dk/191418 | title= 'Mette Jensen-sagen handler ikke om ytringsfrihed' | date= 17 May 2009| accessdate= 2009-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2015, Cheminva was sold to the [[FMC Corporation]] for DKK 8.5 billion, a controversial issue in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.business.dk/industri/saadan-slap-aarhus-universitet-af-med-cheminova|title=Sådan slap Aarhus Universitet af med Cheminova [This is how Aarhus University got rid of Cheminova] |newspaper=Berlingske Business|date=29 April 2015 |author=Birgitte Erhardtsen |language=Danish|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amelia Felle''' (born 1961) is an Italian operatic [[soprano]] and voice teacher. Born in [[Bari]], she has been active on the stages of Italian and European opera houses and concert halls since her debut in 1981. She holds the chair in vocal chamber music at the [[Accademia Santa Cecilia]] in Rome, a position she previously held at the Conservatorio Tito Schipa in [[Lecce]]. 

== Biography ==
Felle was born in Bari and received her diplomas in piano and singing from the city's [[Conservatory of Bari|Conservatorio Niccolò Piccinni]]. At the same time she obtained a diploma in architecture from the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Bari]].&lt;ref name = "CS" /&gt; She made her singing debut in Bari in 1981 performing in oratorios by Vivaldi and Pergolesi with the Orchestra Sinfonica della Provincia di Bari.&lt;ref&gt;''Puglia Live'' (24 July 2012). [http://www.puglialive.net/home/news_det.php?nid=58078 "24–25 luglio - L'Orchestra Sinfonica Tito Schipa presenta in 'Le Nozze di Figaro' e 'Serenata per Ottoni' - Lecce"]. Retrieved 27 April 2016 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the Concorso Liederistico Internazionale di Finale Ligure and the Voci Nuove per la Lirica competitions in 1984, she made her debut on the opera stage at [[Teatro Lirico Sperimentale]] in [[Spoleto]] as Adina in ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' and sang again there as Norina in ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' (1985) and Susanna ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' directed by [[Gigi Proietti]] (1986).&lt;ref name ="GSL" /&gt; 

She went on to make her house debuts at the [[Teatro San Carlo]] as Sofia in ''[[Il signor Bruschino]]'' (1986), [[La Fenice]] as Musetta in ''[[La bohème]]'' (1987), and [[La Scala]] as Jemmy in ''[[Guillaume Tell]]'' (1988). In the first years of her career she sang primarily in operas by Donizetti, Rossini, and Mozart but she also appeared in two rarely performed Mascagni operas, ''[[Le maschere]]'' (as Colombina) and ''[[Sì (operetta)|Sì]]'' (as Vera), as well as singing Nena in La Scala's first performance of Pergolesi's ''[[Lo frate 'nnamorato]]''. Her later [[Verdi]]an roles included Amelia in ''[[Ballo in maschera]]'', the title role of ''[[Aida]]'', Elvira in ''[[Ernani]]'', Elisabetta in ''[[Don Carlo]]'', Lucrezia in ''[[I due Foscari]]'', and Amelia in ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. &lt;ref name ="GSL"&gt;Kutsch, Karl-Josef and Riemens.

In the early 2000s Felle left the opera stage and has since concentrated on the vocal chamber music repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Sassanelli, Fiorella (9 December 2003).

== Activities ==

=== Case competition ===

The competition centres around a 40-hour-long case,&lt;ref name="QuahChin"&gt;Quah Chin Chin (29 October 2008). "A battle of wits and grit". The Business Times.&lt;/ref&gt; where students would strategize their best solution to a [[business case study]], and present their case to a panel of judges. In 2017, after one successful decade of hosting Asian Business Case Competition, the format of competition was changed to include one 8-hour case, and one 24-hour case to provide an enhanced competition experience.

A one-day event during ABCC is dedicated to sustainability each year. It has taken different forms in the past few years including panel discussions and mini-case presentations, revolving around sustainability. Some of the highlights include the sustainability roundtable event in 2010, where participants were split into different groups to hold a discussion based on the central theme of “Profitable Shade of Green”. Other formats include 2011’s event, which took the form of a mini-case, where teams were challenged to come up with a strategic plan for sustainable growth in the [[Small-Medium Enterprise]] (SME) context, with a focus on engaging fresh graduate talent.

He was the founder of Conservatory Theatre Ensemble in [[Mill Valley, California]], where he taught drama at [[Tamalpais High School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinij.com/general-news/20150324/visionary-tam-high-drama-teacher-dan-caldwell-dies-at-79 Visionary Tam High drama teacher Dan Caldwell dies at 79]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/marinij/obituary.aspx?pid=174424590&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Caldwell attended Tamalpais High School, transferring to [[Sir Francis Drake High School]] in [[Fairfax, California|Fairfax]] when it opened in 1951.  He graduated from Drake in 1952.

==Teaching career==

Caldwell taught drama for 37 years at [[Tamalpais High School]], from 1962 to until his retirement in 1999.  In 1976, with Michelle Swanson, he cofounded the Ensemble Theatre Company of Marin (ETC), which later changed its name to the Conservatory Theatre Ensemble (CTE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinscope.com/rossvalleyreporter/detail_page.php?rdate=2008-05-01%2014:54:54&amp;pcode=MVH&amp;scode=Mn1&amp;ldate=2008-01-30%2017:07:23 "A look back at Tam High’s rich history"], Chuck Oldenburg, ''Mill Valley Herald,'' retrieved September 7, 2008, from the ''Ross Valley Reporter''&lt;/ref&gt;  Calwell and Swanson won the F. Loren Winship Secondary School Theatre Award from the American Alliance of Theatre and Education in 1988 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aate.com/awards_winners.asp American Alliance of Theatre and Education, AATE Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513151709/http://www.aate.com/awards_winners.asp |date=2008-05-13 }}, retrieved September 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable former students at Tam and CTE include [[Michael Thomsett]] (Class of 1966), [[Kathleen Quinlan]] (Class of 1972),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinij.com/lifestyles/ci_7189746 "Milley Awards: Quinlan's favorite role: Mom"], [[Michael Aron]] (class of 1986) Paul Liberatore, October 15, 2007, ''Marin Independent Journal,'' retrieved September 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Courtney Thorne-Smith]] (1985), and [[Tupac Shakur]] (1989), [[Merritt Butrick]] (September 3, 1959 – March 17, 1989) in the mid 70's.

In 2002, the [[Tamalpais Union High School District]] named the new theater under construction at Tam the "Daniel Caldwell Performing Arts Center."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamdistrict.org/board/minutes/2002/1022.htm Tamalpais Union High School District, Board of Trustees Minutes, October 22, 2002 • Regular Meeting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630164433/http://tamdistrict.org/board/minutes/2002/1022.htm |date=June 30, 2006 }}, retrieved September 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The new Center was completed and opened in 2006.

==Stage and film career==

Caldwell's early career as a film actor includes work with [[Woody Allen]], [[Otto Preminger]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Tommy Chong]], [[Richard Lester]] and [[John Korty]].&lt;ref name=CTEbio&gt;[http://www.ctetam.org/pages/teachers-staff/guest/guest_DCaldwell.html Conservatory Theatre Ensemble, Guest Artists: Daniel Caldwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120183104/http://www.ctetam.org/pages/teachers-staff/guest/guest_DCaldwell.html |date=2008-11-20 }}, retrieved September 7, 2008 (His acting and directing credits can not easily be determined on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com), which combines at least some of his credits with those of another actor named Dan Caldwell who died in 1996.)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a director in the early years of [[Marin Shakespeare Company|Marin Shakespeare Festival]] and a freelance director of the long running play, ''The Trial Of James McNeill Whistler.''  His recent work included ''The Art of Dining.'' at Marin Theatre Company, ''Autumn Canticle,'' at the Eureka Theatre, and the film ''Dead City,'' directed by his former student and CTE grad, Jason Houston.

'''Dominie''' ([[wikt:dominie|Wiktionary definition]]) is a [[Scots language]] and [[Scottish English]] term for a Scottish [[schoolmaster]] usually of the [[Church of Scotland]] and also a term used in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Origin==
It comes from the Latin ''domine'' (vocative case of Dominus 'Lord, Master').  When the Church of Scotland began to introduce universal provision of [[education in Scotland]] after it became established as a [[national church]] in 1560, its aim was to have a university educated schoolmaster in every [[parish]]. The [[minister of the Church of Scotland|minister]] sometimes served as the dominie. Over time this came to be used as a term for a minister, schoolmaster or university student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dominie&gt;{{OED|dominie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Scots hold the universal provision of education in high regard, which was one of a number of social improvements to arise from the [[Scots Reformation]].  It accounts for a difference in attitudes to education between Scotland and other UK countries.{{Dubious|date=May 2012}}

In the United States the same word is used to describe a [[pastor]] in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]].&lt;ref name=dominie/&gt;

'''Donald Justice''' (August 12, 1925 – August 6, 2004) was an American [[poet]] and teacher of writing. In summing up Justice's career [[David Orr (journalist)|David Orr]] wrote, "In most ways, Justice was no different from any number of solid, quiet older writers devoted to traditional short poems. But he was different in one important sense: sometimes his poems weren't just good; they were great. They were great in the way that Elizabeth Bishop's poems were great, or Thom Gunn's or Philip Larkin's. They were great in the way that tells us what poetry used to be, and is, and will be."&lt;ref name=Orr&gt;{{cite news |last=Orr |first=David |title='Collected Poems': The Ironist of Nostalgia |date=August 29, 2004 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/books/review/29ORRL.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Justice grew up in Florida, and earned a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Miami]] in 1945. He received an M.A. from the [[University of North Carolina]] in 1947, studied for a time at [[Stanford University]], and ultimately earned a doctorate from the [[University of Iowa]] in 1954. He went on to teach for many years at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], the nation's first graduate program in creative writing. He also taught at [[Syracuse University]], the [[University of California]] at Irvine, [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Virginia]], and the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Donald Justice, 78, a Poet Admired for Precise Beauty |work=The New York Times |date=August 10, 2004 |last=Saxon |first=Wolfgang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/arts/donald-justice-78-a-poet-admired-for-precise-beauty.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Date of birth taken from the [[Social Security Death Index]].&lt;!--Donald R.

Justice published thirteen collections of his poetry. The first collection, ''The Summer Anniversaries'', was the winner of the [[James Laughlin Award|Lamont Poetry Prize]] given by the [[Academy of American Poets]] in 1961; ''Selected Poems'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1980. He was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize]] in Poetry in 1991, and the [[Lannan Literary Awards#Lannan Literary Award for Poetry|Lannan Literary Award for Poetry]] in 1996.

His honors also included grants from the [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. He was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], and a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]] from 1997 to 2003. His ''Collected Poems'' was nominated for the [[National Book Award]] in 2004. Justice was also a National Book Award Finalist in 1961, 1974, and 1995.

In his obituary, Andrew Rosenheim notes that Justice "was a legendary teacher, and despite his own Formalist reputation influenced a wide range of younger writers — his students included [[Mark Strand]], [[Rita Dove]], [[James Tate (writer)|James Tate]], [[C. Dale Young]], [[Ellen Bryant Voigt]], Will Schmitz, [[Jorie Graham]] and the novelist [[John Irving]]."&lt;ref name=Rosenheim&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenheim |first=Andrew |date=August 18, 2004 |title=Donald Justice: Award-winning poet revered by his peers and influential to a wide range of younger writers |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/donald-justice-550298.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--unsourced claim in earlier version includes [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], Will Schmitz, [[Mark Jarman]], [[Chase Twichell]]--&gt; His student and later colleague [[Marvin Bell]] said in a reminiscence, "As a teacher, Don chose always to be on the side of the poem, defending it from half-baked attacks by students anxious to defend their own turf. While he had firm preferences in private, as a teacher Don defended all turfs. He had little use for poetic theory..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bell |first=Marvin |journal=[[The Iowa Review]] |volume=34 |issue=3 |title=A Garland for Donald Justice: A Reminiscence |pages=177–178 |date=Winter 2004–2005 |jstor=20151937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Justice's accomplishments as a poet, his former student, the poet and critic [[Tad Richards]], noted that "Donald Justice is likely to be remembered as a poet who gave his age a quiet but compelling insight into loss and distance, and who set a standard for craftsmanship, attention to detail, and subtleties of rhythm."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Tad (2005). [http://www.opus40.org/tadrichards/DJusticeGW.html "Donald Justice,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202113409/http://www.opus40.org/tadrichards/DJusticeGW.html |date=December 2, 2008 }} ''Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Poets and Poetry'' (Greenwood Press). {{ISBN|978-0-313-32381-2}}.

Justice's work was the subject of the 1998 volume ''Certain Solitudes: On The Poetry of Donald Justice'', a collection of essays edited by [[Dana Gioia]] and [[William Logan (poet)|William Logan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Gioia |editor1-first=Dana |editor2-last=Logan |editor2-first=William |date=1998 |title=Certain Solitudes: On The Poetry of Donald Justice |publisher=University of Arkansas Press |isbn=978-1-55728-475-4 |oclc=875545534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Justice died August 6, 2004 at an Iowa City, IA nursing home. He'd been staying at the nursing home after suffering a stroke several weeks before he died. He was 78 years old. His family said the immediate cause of death was pneumonia, but that he also had [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

[[File:Educational Management Mindmap.jpg|thumb|An Overview of Educational Management]]

'''Educational management''' refers to the administration of the education system whereby a collective group combines human and material resources to supervise, plan, strategise, and implement structures to execute the functions of an education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nie.edu.sg/higher-degrees/masters-by-coursework/master-of-arts-educational-management|title=Master of Arts (Educational Management) {{!}} National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore|website=www.nie.edu.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connolly|first=Michael|last2=James|first2=Chris|last3=Fertig|first3=Michael|date=2017-12-20|title=The difference between educational management and educational leadership and the importance of educational responsibility|journal=Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership|language=en|pages=174114321774588|doi=10.1177/1741143217745880|issn=1741-1432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is the equipping of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, habits, and attitudes through learning experiences. The education system is an ecosystem of professionals situated in educational institutions such as Government ministries, unions, statutory boards, agencies, and schools. The education system comprises political heads, principals, teaching staff, non-teaching staff, administrative personnel and other education professionals working in tandem to enrich and enhance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/topics/educational-administration.html|title=Educational Administration|website=www.rand.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Educational_Management.html|title=What Is Educational Management?|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At all levels of the ecosystem in the education system, management is required. Management involves the planning, organising, implementation, review, evaluation, and integration of clear deliverables of the institution.

The function of educational management can be referenced to [[Henri Fayol]]'s 14 Principles of Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managementstudyhq.com/henri-fayol-principles-of-management.html|title=Henri Fayol's 14 Principles of Management {{!}} Management Study HQ|date=2013-07-24|work=Management Study HQ|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

=== Co-curricular Activities ===
Co-curricular activities help students maintain a holistic education and are a key expression of students' interests and talents. These activities also help foster a sense of social integration and add an important sense of commitment and belonging to one's community and country. Co-curricular activities include science-oriented talent development programmes, clubs and societies, physical sports, uniformed groups, and visual and performing arts groups. Co-curricular activities could also include student interests groups such as advocacy groups, botany, personal care, innovation, research methodologies, and current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.np.edu.sg/studentlife/Pages/ccas.aspx|title=Clubs &amp; Societies|website=www.np.edu.sg|language=en-SG|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sst.edu.sg/cca/|title=CCA|website=School of Science and Technology, Singapore|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.moe.edu.sg/secondary/mg-curriculum/co-curricular-activities-cca/achievements|title=Achievements|website=www.mgs.moe.edu.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Curriculum Planning and Development ===
Curriculum planning and development involves “the design and development of integrated plans for learning, and of the evaluation of plans, their implementation and the outcomes of the learning experience”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/teaching/teaching-strategies/curriculum-development/a-curriculum-process.cfm|title=A Curriculum Development Process|website=www.flinders.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of this department is to design and review curriculum, promote teaching and assessment strategies that are aligned to curriculum frameworks, formulate special curriculum programmes, create clear and observable objectives, and generate effective assessment rubrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The skilful teacher: Building your teaching skills|last=Saphier|first=J|last2=Haley|first2=M|last3=Gower|last4=R|publisher=Research For Better Teaching|year=2008|isbn=|location=Acton, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curriculum development can be described in a three-stage process, encompassing the planned curriculum, the delivered curriculum, and lastly the experienced curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The curriculum is often shaped by the pedagogical approaches contributed by theorists and researchers such as notable figures like [[John Dewey]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], and [[Albert Bandura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nurturing Early Learners: A Curriculum Framework for Kindergartens in Singapore|last=Ministry of Education, Singapore|publisher=Ministry of Education, Singapore|year=2012|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pre-school Education ====
Curriculum development as the pre-school education level is based on the different school of thoughts. They include but are not limited to:

* The [[Kindergarten|Froebelian Kindergarten]] was established by [[Friedrich Fröbel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]] when he set up the first kindergarten programme in Germany in 1837. Froebel described three forms of knowledge that he viewed as essential aspects that formed the basis of all learning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Am I in the Lives of Children? An Introduction to Early Childhood Education|last=Feeney|first=Stephanie|last2=Moravcik|first2=Eva|last3=Nolte|last4=Sherry|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2013|isbn=978-981-45-2689-0|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, knowledge of forms of life, which include an appreciation for gardening, animals and domestic tasks. Secondly, the knowledge of forms of mathematics, such as geometry and the relationships with each form. Lastly, knowledge of forms of beauty, which include colour and shape, harmonies and movement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The goals of the Froebelian Kindergarten are awakening the child's physical senses through learning experiences and providing common ground for all individuals to advance. The practices that have been adapted from the Froebelian Kindergarten include teaching materials and activities, as well as education preparation programmes for teachers
*[[Margaret McMillan|Margaret]] and [[Rachel McMillan]] were social reformers in England who spend their lives trying to address the problems poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcmillannurseryschool.co.uk/?p=2078|title=History of the McMillan Sisters|date=2015-01-15|work=McMillan Nursery School|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The established the Open-Air [[Preschool|Nursery School]] and Training Centre in London. The goals of the [[Preschool|Nursery School]] were to provide loving care, health support, nourishment and physical welfare to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betty|first=Liebovich|date=2014|title=The Contributions of the McMIllan Sisters to Early Years Education in England.|journal=FORUM: For Promoting 3-19 Comprehensive Education|volume=56|issue=3|pages=529|doi=10.15730/forum.2014.56.3.529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, assistance was provided to parents to aid them in caring for and interacting with their children. Pedagogical models on how to engage and interact with young children were also provided. The pedagogical principles of the [[Preschool|Nursery School]] can be found in educational frameworks that require teachers to nurture and teach a curriculum that covers the domains of an exploration of the world, aesthetics, music and movement and literacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*[[John Dewey]] formed the theory of [[Progressive education]] during the progressive movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Dewey|title=John Dewey {{!}} American philosopher and educator|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Dewey|title=John Dewey {{!}} American philosopher and educator|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progressive education philosophy embraces the idea that children should be taught how to think. Dewey was opposed to assessments as they cannot measure whether or not a child is an educated person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/progressive-education-how-children-learn-today-2774713|title=Progressive Education - How Children Learn|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the school community offers learning opportunities that are interesting and meaningful, and prepare individuals to live in a democratic society. Children learn through doing, cooperation, problem solving and collaborations with the teacher acting as a guide. For example, projects in the curriculum encourage exploration, self-discovery and sensorial experiences that translate to a holistic approach. The curriculum focusses on the children's interests and are developmentally appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naeyc.org/resources/topics/12-principles-of-child-development|title=12 Principles of Child Development and Learning that Inform Practice {{!}} NAEYC|website=www.naeyc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Montessori education|Montessori]] approach was developed by [[Maria Montessori]] who believed that children go through sensitive periods, also known as 'window of opportunities'.&lt;ref name="What is Montessori Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://montessori-nw.org/what-is-montessori-education/|title=What is Montessori Education?|website=Montessori Northwest - Montessori Teacher Training &amp; Professional Development in Portland, Oregon|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every material in a Montessori classroom enhances and develops the child's growth. Materials consist of children's interests and found materials in the natural environment.&lt;ref name="What is Montessori Education"/&gt; The whole learning environment is focused on the child, also known as the child-centred environment. The curriculum trains children to be responsive and promote the desire for skills mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Curriculum: Alternative approaches.|last=Marsh|first=C.|last2=Willis|first2=G|publisher=Pearson/Merrill Prentice|year=2007|isbn=|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Waldorf Education was created by Austrian philosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]]. In Waldorf education, there is a great focus on the whole child, in particular the body, mind, and spirit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The curriculum is designed to provoke thought processes, create sensitivity in their feelings, and enhance fluency in creative and artistic representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://waldorfpeninsula.org/curriculum/|title=Curriculum - Waldorf School of the Peninsula|work=Waldorf School of the Peninsula|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waldorfsingapore.com/about-waldorf-education/|title=About Waldorf Education {{!}}|website=www.waldorfsingapore.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Waldorf curriculum consists of storytelling, aesthetics (arts), practical work, imaginative play, and discovery of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://waldorfpeninsula.org/curriculum/early-childhood/|title=Early Childhood - Waldorf School of the Peninsula|work=Waldorf School of the Peninsula|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern schools adopting the Waldorf Education are independent, self-governing schools due to the spirituality-based pedagogy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*The Reggio Emilia Approach was created in a small northern Italian city of [[Reggio Emilia]]. It is influenced by constructivist theories and the progressive education movement, with a commitment to uphold the rights of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child development : an active learning approach|last=E.|first=Levine, Laura|others=Munsch, Joyce|isbn=9781506386737|edition= Third|location=Los Angeles ; London ; New Delhi ; Singapore ; Washington DC ; Melbourne|oclc=992503617|date = 2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key concepts in a Reggio Emilia school include the child's right to education, the importance of interpersonal relationships amongst children, teachers and parents, and children's interactions through work and play.&lt;ref name="The Compass School"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecompassschool.com/about/reggio-emilia-inspired-philosophy/|title=The Reggio Emilia Philosophy of Learning {{!}} The Compass School|work=The Compass School|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reggiochildren.it/identita/reggio-emilia-approach/?lang=en|title=Reggio Emilia Approach {{!}} Reggio Children|website=Reggio Emilia Approach {{!}} Reggio Children|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum emerges from the children's interest and developed through projects and inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mulberrylearning.com/reggio-emilia-approach-works/|title=The Reggio Emilia Approach And Why It Works - Mulberry|date=2016-05-16|work=Mulberry|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual plays an important role in the school and parental involvement is a key aspect of the child's learning and development.&lt;ref name="The Compass School"/&gt;

==== Primary Education ====
Curriculum development at the primary education focuses on the foundations of subjects. The curriculum covers the various aspects of Subject Disciplines, Knowledge Skills, and Character Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/primary/primary-school-curriculum|title=Primary School Curriculum|website=www.moe.gov.sg|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subject disciplines comprise the various core and foundational subjects of Language, Science, Humanities, Arts, Technology, and Social Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-primary-curriculum|title=National curriculum in England: primary curriculum|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridgeschool.eu/en/curriculum-learning/primary-curriculum/|title=Primary Curriculum - Primary School Curriculum|website=www.cambridgeschool.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/resources/primary-curriculum/illustrations-of-practice/landsdale-primary-school/|title=Landsdale Primary School|website=www.australiancurriculum.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/learning-areas/|title=Learning areas|website=www.australiancurriculum.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge skills involve personal skills and attributes such as communication, critical thinking, teamwork, and judgement. These skills are developed through unique learning experiences based on the school's pedagogical practices, which are aligned with the mission and vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Primary School Education: Preparing Your Child For The Future|last=Ministry of Education, Singapore|publisher=Ministry of Education, Singapore|year=2018|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Character development, according to Eisner, is defined as the implicit curriculum, otherwise known as the hidden agenda of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://teaching.up.edu/edresearch/pages/Eisner.html|title=Five conceptions of curriculum: Their roots and implications for curriculum planning|last=Eisner|first=E.

==== Secondary Education ====
Curriculum development varies based on the course or stream the student is enrolled in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.moe.gov.sg/courses/|title=Courses and subjects for secondary schools {{!}} Ministry of Education|website=beta.moe.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum development primarily focuses on core subjects such as Language, Mathematics, Science, and Humanities.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.moe.gov.sg/courses/express/|title=Express course for secondary school {{!}} Ministry of Education|website=beta.moe.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.go.ug/content/o-level-curriculum|title=O Level Curriculum|last=National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC)|date=2018|website=National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edb.gov.hk/en/curriculum-development/renewal/guides.html|title=Ongoing Renewal of The School Curriculum|last=|publisher=Education Bureau|date=2013|website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning experiences, strategic goals, national frameworks, and school philosophy are also considered in curriculum development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.moe.gov.sg/schools/how-to-choose/|title=How to choose secondary schools {{!}} Ministry of Education|website=beta.moe.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools also consider values and progressive skills in the development of a holistic curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/renewal/Guides/SECG%20booklet%202_en_20180831.pdf|title=Learning Goals, School Curriculum Framework and Planning|last=The Government of The Hong Kong Administrative Region|publisher=Education Bureau|year=2017|isbn=|location=Hong Kong|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special elective and vocational programmes are also offered which includes social studies, art and music, design and technology and computer studies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Specialised schools integrate programmes with corporate partners to include programmes such as Information and Communication Technology, Entrepreneurship, Art, Design, Media and Da Vinci.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sst.edu.sg/programmes/extended-curriculum/|title=Extended Curriculum|website=School of Science and Technology, Singapore|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nushigh.edu.sg/academic-curriculum/nus-high-school-diploma|title=NUS High School Diploma|website=www.nushigh.edu.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, enhanced programmes in sports, arts, and language are offered in schools with specified goals in education and curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secondary School Education: Shaping the Next Phase of your Child's Learning Journey|last=Ministry of Education, Singapore|publisher=Ministry of Education, Singapore|year=2018|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tertiary Education ====
Curriculum development at the tertiary education level involves specific course design and development. Griffith University describes planning as based on previously collected evidence; the process also involves assessment, technologically informed learning and discipline-based capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.griffith.edu.au/learning-futures/our-practice/curriculum-development|title=Curriculum development|last=Searles|first=Ainslie|website=www.griffith.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this process aims to prepare students for the workforce, while enhancing their understanding of the subject. Griffith University, for example, considers five key elements in curriculum development; specifically, Learning Analytics, External Peer Review, Peer-based Professional Learning and Professional Learning Workshops.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Educational Technology ===
Educational technology involves the integration, planning, implementation and management of [[Information and communications technology]] (ICT) for effective learning and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edx.org/learn/educational-technology|title=Educational Technology|date=2018-04-09|work=edX|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the educational technology branch in the education system is for conceptualisation and development of ICT in education, integration into existing curriculum frameworks, staff development, and management.

In modern times, the focus of educational technology has shifted to online and web-based applications, learning portals, flipped classrooms and a whole variety of social networks for the purposes of teaching and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.useoftechnology.com/information-technology-education/|title=6 USES OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION|last=Ramey|first=Karehka|date=December 2, 2012|website=Useoftechnology.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational technology includes ICT but is not limited to the use of both physical hardware and educational theoretics. It encompasses several domains  including collaborative learning, [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]], linear learning, online portal learning, and where mobile technologies are used, [[m-learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Educational technology|date=2018-09-29|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Educational_technology&amp;oldid=861765814|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These domains contribute to a personalised learning model promotes self-directed learning as students take charge and are responsible for their own learning.

=== Finance and Budget ===
This department oversees financial policies regarding the various educational institutes that provides administrative support to schools relating to financial assistance, revenue operations and school funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.education.go.ug/data/smenu/9/Finance%20and%20Administration.html|title=Finance and Administration|website=www.education.go.ug|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial assistance schemes include subsidies, allowances, and grants funded by the government, that are applied according to income levels and other factors, such as age or institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moey.gov.jm/node/111|title=Finance Division {{!}} Ministry of Education, Youth and Information|website=moey.gov.jm|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also scholarships and awards accorded by merit; however, these may also be reserved for some particular categories of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/about/org-structure/fdd|title=Finance &amp; Procurement|website=www.moe.gov.sg|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health and Physical Development ===
This department's primary role is to develop safe and effective programmes for educating students on healthy living and physical education.

=== Human Resources ===
The primary goals of the human resources department are attracting, developing, and retaining staff in the education ministry. They formulate operational policies and systems that directly affect staff's performance and attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rafiei|first=Nafiseh|last2=Davari|first2=Fereshte|date=February 2015|title=The Role of Human Resources Management on Enhancing the Teaching Skills of Faculty Members|journal=Journal of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|volume=27|issue=1|pages=35–38|doi=10.5455/msm.2014.27.35-38|pmid=25870529|pmc=4384864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the department include a review of organisational structures and procedures, staff skills development and enhancement, and leadership succession and transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/about/org-structure/hr-group|title=Human Resource Group|website=www.moe.gov.sg|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moe.gov.tt/services/hr|title=Ministry of Education|website=moe.gov.tt|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are aimed at fostering greater staff involvement and expansion, eventually leading to the overall goals of the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minedu.fi/en/administrative-branch|title=Administrative branch|website=Opetus- ja kulttuuriministeriö|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/about/whoweare.html|title=Who We Are|last=Ontario|first=Government of|website=www.edu.gov.on.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information Technology ===
Information technology refers to the harnessing of high-quality and calibre technology to facilitate efficient administration, management and hence education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/about/org-structure/itb|title=Information Technology Branch|website=www.moe.gov.sg|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the need for perpetual, up-to-date staff training to ensure educators of all levels are fully equipped with the skill sets needed; hence the managerial level has to identify and conceptualise relevant information that is needed to be taught to teachers for the implementation of these IT systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamidi|first=Farideh|last2=Meshkat|first2=Maryam|last3=Rezaee|first3=Maryam|last4=Jafari|first4=Mehdi|date=2011|title=Information technology in education|journal=Procedia Computer Science|volume=3|pages=369–373|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.062|issn=1877-0509}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also essential to ensure that these IT systems are reliable, accessible and well assimilated by educators. The department faces numerous challenges as IT systems are vulnerable to perpetrators and hackers. A period of close examination during integration may be necessary to guarantee that educators are using the new applications relevantly and correctly. The information management team is also required to conduct surveys to reflect if the implications of new IT policies in the real-world scenario.

=== Psychological ===
The department is at the forefront of ensuring that students with disabilities are able to participate in the student curriculum on the same basis as their peers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/resources/student-diversity/students-with-disability/|title=Students with disability|website=www.australiancurriculum.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves all schools including specialists schools and support classes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is key to contributing to fair and equal student diversity. Special support services include reasonable adjustments, consultations, and personalised learning. Allied educators are important in providing a high quality of interaction with each child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/careers/allied-educators|title=Allied Educators|website=www.moe.gov.sg|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a multidisciplinary team consisting of psychologists, special educators, and therapists, is crucial in fostering appropriate and meaningful learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Educating exceptional children|last=1904-|first=Kirk, Samuel A.

For example, children may display learning difficulties and/or require additional materials while learning. Relevant courses are designed for children with disabilities such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, Intellectual Disability, Visual Impairment, Hearing Loss and Cerebral Palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/special-education|title=Special Educational Needs|website=www.moe.gov.sg|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional assistance may be provided by applicable social service organisations, non-government organisations, voluntary welfare organisations, and corporate partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10164">The '''Georgetown Leadership Seminar (GLS)''' is an annual gathering of selected rising leaders from around the world for a week of intensive discussion on major international issues. The program was established in 1982 by [[Georgetown University]] in order to promote dialogue among individuals who would shape the futures of their countries. GLS attracts individuals from government, corporations, law firms, financial institutions, the military, international organizations, NGOs, the media, universities, think tanks, and elsewhere who occupy positions of influence and have the potential to move up to greater leadership roles. The selected participants are then exposed to the major global issues and the Washington foreign policy-making process through direct contact with top level policy makers and experts. The program is derived from Harvard’s “international seminar” conducted by [[Henry Kissinger]] in the 1950s and 1960s. The GLS is now administered by the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at the [[School of Foreign Service]] at Georgetown. Original committee members included [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Madeleine Albright]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and [[Peter F. Krogh]].

== Objectives ==

The core belief underlying the GLS is that successful leaders in a globalized world must continually work to improve their understanding of international affairs and connect to an international network. This is accomplished through three distinct goals:

# To promote an exchange of views among emerging public and private sector leaders on key global issues of the future.
# To establish the personal contacts and sense of camaraderie essential to effective international cooperation. 
# To improve understanding by foreign leaders of the perspectives and foreign policy-making process through direct contact with key policy-makers, academics, and other experts in Washington.

The '''Georgian Institute of Public Affairs''' ('''GIPA''') ({{lang-ka|საქართველოს საზოგადოებრივ საქმეთა ინსტიტუტი}}) was created in 1994 in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Four separate schools of the Institute offer MA, BA programs and training courses in the spheres of Public Affairs, Local Governance, Journalism, International Affairs and Law, as well as a PhD program in the social sciences. GIPA is considered as one of the top three universities in Georgia, alongside the [[Free University of Tbilisi]] and [[Tbilisi State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freeuni.ge/ge/node/611 |title=მიმდინარე რეიტინგი |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226182957/http://www.freeuni.ge/ge/node/611 |archivedate=2014-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgian Institute of Public Affairs is a national center for development of practices in Public Administration, Law, Politics and Journalism. Since its establishment, GIPA brought together leaders from business, media, civil society and public services to contribute to developing effective governance at state, municipal and local levels as well as independent and viable media in Georgia through interactive education programs, research and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gipa.ge/eng/page/history/history.html|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from graduate degree and certified training programs, GIPA carries out many research and training projects. It also publishes student newspaper "Brosse Street Journal" and manages the first English-language and student run Radio GIPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gipa.ge/eng/page/history/history.html|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four schools and two programs at GIPA:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6667">{{about|a detection system|the more general electrical component|Inductor}}

An '''induction''' or '''inductive loop''' is an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] communication or detection system which uses a moving [[magnet]] or an alternating current to [[Electromagnetic induction#Faraday's law|induce]] an [[electric current]] in a nearby wire. Induction loops are used for transmission and reception of communication signals, or for detection of metal objects in metal detectors or vehicle presence indicators. A common modern use for induction loops is to provide hearing assistance to hearing-aid users.

== Applications ==

===Audio===

An [[audio induction loop]] provides assistance to hearing aid users. The system has one or more loops in the area in which a hearing aid user would be present. Many different configurations can be used depending on the application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ampetronic.com/layouts_overview.asp Overview of different possible loop configurations]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such an induction loop receiver is classically a very small iron-cored inductor ([[Hearing_aid#Telecoil|telecoil]]).  The system commonly uses an analog power amplifier matched to the low impedance of the transmission loop. The transmission is normally direct rather than superimposed or modulated upon a carrier, though multi-channel systems have been implemented using modulation. Many hearing aids contain a telecoil which allows the user to receive and hear the magnetic field and remove the normal audio signal provided from the hearing aid microphone&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ampetronic.com/basics_how.asp Much more information on audio induction loop basics (Manufacturer's site)]&lt;/ref&gt; site. These loops are often referred to as a hearing loop or [[audio induction loop]]. &lt;ref&gt; Samuel R. Atcherson, Clifford A. Franklin, Laura Smith-Olinde ''Hearing Assistive and Access Technology'', Plural Publishing, 2015, {{ISBN|1597567876}}   pp. 109-115 &lt;/ref&gt;

Since there is no "tuning" available, as the telecoil directly picks up all audio-frequency magnetic fields, careful system design is required where more than one induction loop is used in a building; for example, adjacent movie theatres or lecture halls. Telecoils may also pick up noise from non-audio sources such as power lines, lamps, or CRT monitors.

=== Vehicle detection ===
[[File:Inductance detectors.jpg|thumb|alt=An example of the Inductance loop installed in the road for cars and bikes.|An example of the Inductance loop installed in the road for cars and bikes]][[File:Inductive loop detector.gif|thumb|Schematic of such a detector]]
Vehicle detection loops, called ''inductive-loop traffic detectors'', can detect vehicles passing or arriving at a certain point, for instance approaching a [[traffic light]] or in motorway traffic. An insulated, electrically conducting loop is installed in the pavement.  The electronics unit transmits energy into the wire loops at frequencies between 10 k[[Hertz|Hz]] to 200&amp;nbsp;kHz, depending on the model. The inductive-loop system behaves as a tuned electrical circuit in which the loop wire and lead-in cable are the inductive elements. When a vehicle passes over the loop or is stopped within the loop, the vehicle induces [[eddy current]]s in the wire loops, which decrease their inductance. The decreased [[inductance]] actuates the electronics unit output relay or solid-state optically isolated output, which sends a pulse to the traffic signal controller signifying the passage or presence of a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/its/06108/02.cfm|title=Traffic Detector Handbook|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parking structures for automobiles may use inductive loops to track traffic (occupancy) in and out or may be used by access gates or ticketing systems to detect vehicles while others use [[Parking guidance and information]] systems. Railways may use an induction loop to detect the passage of trains past a given point, as an electronic [[treadle (railway)|treadle]].

The relatively crude nature of the loop's structure means that only metal masses above a certain size are capable of triggering the relay.  This is good in that the loop does not thus produce very many "false positive" triggers (say, for example, by a pedestrian crossing the loop with a pocket full of loose metal change) but it sometimes also means that bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles stopped at such intersections may never be detected by them (and therefore risk being ignored by the switch/signal).  Most loops can be manually adjusted to consistently detect the presence of scooters and motorcycles at the least.

===Vehicle classification===
Inductance loops have also been used to classify types of vehicles.Sampling the loop at a high frequency results in a unique signature for each vehicle allowing for classification of the body type. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB5Mll9tO3A|title=Inductance Loop Signatures}} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metal detector ===
A different sort of "induction loop" is applied to [[metal detector]]s, where a large coil, which forms part of a resonant circuit, is effectively "detuned" by the coil's proximity to a conductive object.
The detected object may be metallic (metal and cable detection) or conductive/capacitive ([[Stud finder|stud]]/cavity detection).
Other configurations of this equipment use two or more receiving coils, and the detected object modifies the inductive coupling or alters the phase angle of the voltage induced in the receiving coils relative to the oscillator coil.

An [[anti-submarine indicator loop]] was a device used to detect [[submarine]]s and surface vessels using specially designed submerged cables connected to a [[galvanometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indicatorloops.com/loopworks.htm|title=What are Indicator Loops and how do they work?|accessdate=2007-10-28|last=Walding|first=Richard|work=Indicatorloops.com|publisher=Richard Walding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inquiry in motion''' (IIM) has a goal of improving the motivation, potential, and achievement of students and teachers through sustained engagement in science, math, engineering, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/education/inquiry-in-motion/|title=Inquiry in Motion|website=www.clemson.edu|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; IIM achieves increased teaching performance and improved student achievement largely by providing numerous support structures for teachers as they learn to facilitate more inquiry-based learning environments that are well aligned with constructivist learning philosophies.

A dynamic lesson-planning tool for K–12 math and science teachers is one central component of the IIM program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/iim/lessonplans/|title=Inquiry in Motion|website=www.clemson.edu|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the Tool, teachers can use ''Public Lessons'' as is, modify an existing lesson by moving it into ''My WorkSpace'', or create ''New Lessons'' for public or personal viewing.

Lessons from the Lesson Planning Tool integrate key concepts (essential ideas) into an [[inquiry-based learning]] environment and are based on the 4E x 2 Instructional Model. The 4E x 2 Instructional Model is based on the premise that student achievement increases when teachers effectively incorporate three critical learning constructs into their teaching practice: (1) inquiry instruction,&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council. (2000). Inquiry and the national science education standards: A guide for teaching and learning. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) formative assessment,&lt;ref&gt;Black, P., &amp; Wiliam, D. (1998a). Assessment and classroom learning. Assessment in Education, 5(1), 7–74.&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) teacher reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nbrc.illinoisstate.edu/downloads/nbrc/NPBTS_research_pocket_000.pdf|title=Making A Difference in Quality Teaching and Student Achievement.|date=2007|website=National Board for Professional Teaching Standards|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4E x 2 Instructional Model has been published in numerous research and practitioner publications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10972-008-9114-7 | last1 = Marshall | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Horton | first2 = B. | last3 = Smart | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = 4E x 2 Instructional Model: Uniting three learning constructs to improve praxis in science and mathematics classrooms | url = | journal = Journal of Science Teacher Education | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 501–516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, J. C. &amp; Horton, R. M. (2009) ''Developing, assessing, and sustaining inquiry-based instruction: A guide for math and science teachers and leaders.'' Germany: [[VDM Verlag]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Teacher success implementing inquiry-based instruction can be measured using EQUIP (Electronic Quality of Inquiry Protocol). EQUIP is a descriptive rubric designed to measure the degree to which inquiry-based instruction is occurring in the classroom and contains nineteen indicators (e.g., instructional strategies, questioning ecology) and five constructs (e.g., instruction, assessment). Reliability and validity was tested during the three-year development and refinement process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = Marshall, J. C.|author2 =  Smart, J.|author3 = Horton, R. M.|year = 2010|title = The design and validation of EQUIP: An instrument to assess inquiry-based instruction|journal = [[International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education]]|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 299–321|doi = 10.1007/s10763-009-9174-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marshall | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Horton | first2 = B. | last3 = White | first3 = C. | year = 2009 | title = EQUIPping teachers: A protocol to guide and improve inquiry-based instruction | url = | journal = The Science Teacher | volume = 76 | issue = 4| pages = 46–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008–2009, the data from the MAP (Measure of Academic Progress) test show a clear difference among the growth seen on Virtual Control Group (students from other districts with similar [[Demographics|demographic]] composition), the Control Group (non-participating teachers from [[Greenville County, South Carolina|Greenville County]]), and the Study Group (participants in the Inquiry in Motion program). Specifically, the data show that the students of participating teachers significantly outperformed the students of non-participating teachers from their same school. Both groups also exceeded the performance of students from the virtual [[control group]]. These trends were seen for student performance in both science content and science process. The implication is that as the quantity and quality of inquiry-based instruction improves, so too does student achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">The '''International Medical Education Directory''' ('''IMED''') was a public database of worldwide [[medical schools]]. The IMED was published as a joint collaboration of the [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]] (ECFMG) and the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] (FAIMER).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/about/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools {{!}} About|website=www.wdoms.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information available in IMED was derived from data collected by the [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]] (ECFMG) throughout its history of evaluating the medical education credentials of international medical graduates. Using these data as a starting point, [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] (FAIMER) began developing ''IMED'' in 2001 and made it publicly available in April 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''International School of New Media''' (short '''ISNM''') in [[Lübeck]], [[Germany]] was an international, affiliated private institute at the [[University of Lübeck]]. It was closed end of 2011.

ISNM was established in 2001 by founding director [[Hubertus von Amelunxen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://egs.edu/faculty/hubertus-von-amelunxen/ Hubertus von Amelunxen], Faculty of the [[European Graduate School]]&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of providing a course that combines the technological, scientific, social, economical, and cultural aspects and implications of New Media.

At the ISNM, students work and study with peers with diverse [[cultural]] and [[educational]] backgrounds. For instance, architects, computer scientists, artists, and sociologists can work together on a project as a team.

Until 2008, ISNM offered a graduate program conducted entirely in English leading to an award of a ''M.Sc. in Digital Media'' degree.  The 24-month-long program received international accreditation by ZeVA Hannover. The M.Sc. in Digital Media program provided academic training in interdisciplinary media competence. It connected Media Technology, Computer Science, design and e-commerce with the New Media in the arts, culture and society. The M.Sc. degree qualified students for positions at the intersections of digital media in business, industry, research, education, tourism and international organisations, among others.

The ISNM’s interdisciplinary graduate program in Digital Media aimed at creating decision-makers and managers in every sector and discipline with a more complete understanding of digital media's role in the 21st century’s global world and market. The program followed a concerted strategy to reach this goal by providing a unique combination of technology, business, research, arts, design and culture in the Digital Media sector. Substantial emphasis was placed on the transfer of learning from the university to the work setting and an integration of students’ diverse backgrounds into interdisciplinary project management and intercultural teamwork.

ISNM founders have set the standard for the faculty whose teaching and research is consistently influencing New Media practices. The faculty is a group with honors and research awards on their credits.

'''Mirza Jabbar Asgarzadeh''' ([[Persian Language|Persian]]:میرزا جبار عسگرزاده) famously known as '''Jabbar Baghtcheban''' ([[Persian Language|Persian]]: جبار باغچه بان) was an Iranian inventor of [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Iranian Azerbaijani]] ethnicity. He is well known as someone who established the first [[Iran]]ian [[kindergarten]] and the first deaf school in [[Tabriz]]. He was also the inventor of [[Persian language]] [[cued speech]]. He was the father of the late Iranian composer [[Samin Baghcheban]].

== Biography ==
Mirza Jabbar Asgarzadeh was born in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. His origin was from [[Tabriz]] or [[Urmia]] in the [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] region. The first kindergarten he established was called the ''baghch-e atfal'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: باغچه اطفال) which means the "kids garden". That is why he was given the nickname ''baghcheban'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: باغچه بان) which literally means "gardener" in the [[Persian language]]. 
He founded a school for the deaf in 1924. That school was located next to his kindergarten. In 1928 he wrote the first Iranian children's book in Persian. The book was called ''baba barfi'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: بابابرفی) which means means "snow daddy" in Persian.

The comic books were designed to communicate the dangers of drug abuse to elementary school children. The Drug Abuse Policy Office coordinated the project, DC Comics developed the story line and artwork, and private companies funded the production costs. The Keebler Company sponsored the fourth grade book (released in April 1983), the National Soft Drink Association sponsored the sixth grade book (November 1983), and IBM sponsored the fifth grade book through the National Federation of Parents for Drug Free Youth (February 1984). The files consist primarily of correspondence with educators, parents, and children.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he scripted the ''[[Super Powers Collection|Super Powers]]'' limited series which tied-in with the [[Kenner Products]] toyline of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 208: In association with the toy company Kenner, DC released a line of toys called Super Powers...DC soon debuted a five-issue ''Super Powers'' miniseries plotted by comic book legend Jack 'King' Kirby, scripted by Joey Cavalieri, and with pencils by Adrian Gonzales.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavalieri and artist [[Jerome K. Moore]] introduced a new costume for the [[Black Canary]] character in ''Detective Comics'' #554 (Sept. 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 214: "Written by Joey Cavalieri and drawn by Jerome K. Moore, Canary's new costume ditched her trademark fishnets in favor of black spiky shoulders and a matching headband."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Cavalieri was one of the contributing writers for the company's 50th anniversary publication ''[[Fifty Who Made DC Great]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer= Marx, Barry|cowriters = Cavalieri, Joey and Hill, Thomas|artist= Petruccio, Steven|editor = Marx, Barry|title= Fifty Who Made DC Great|date= 1985| publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was group editor of the [[Marvel 2099]] series from 1992 until 1996 before returning to DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb|type=editor|search= Joey+Cavalieri|title= Joey Cavalieri (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''[[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]'' limited series was co-written by Cavalieri and [[Terry Kavanagh]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cowsill|first = Alan|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 212|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Writers Joey Cavalieri and Terry Kavanagh and artist Andrew Wildman were at the helm for the Black Cat's first four-issue miniseries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lauren K. Alleyne''' is an award-winning Trinidadian-American poet, fiction, and nonfiction writer and educator born and raised in the dual-island Caribbean nation of [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

==Biography==
In 1997, Alleyne moved to the United States to begin her undergraduate studies in Radiologic Science and Nuclear Medical Technology at St. Francis College in New York. It was not until her junior year that Alleyne decided to shift her focus towards English. She then graduated with honors from St. Francis College with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature. In 2002, she received her Masters of Fine Arts in English with an emphasis on creative writing from Iowa State. Finally, in January 2006, she received her Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, as well as a graduate certificate in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality studies from [[Cornell University]]. Alleyne is also a graduate of [[Cave Canem Foundation|Cave Canem]], a non-profit literary service organization with administrative and programming headquarters that works to promote and advance under-represented African-American poets in the literary world, and provide an environment that fosters the growth of African-American voices and artistry. In addition to serving her talents in the literary community, Alleyne also worked as the Poet-in-Residence and as an Assistant Professor in English at the [[University of Dubuque]] in [[Iowa]]. Currently, Alleyne works as an Associate Professor in English, and the Assistant Director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center at [[James Madison University]] in Virginia.&lt;ref name="jmu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jmu.edu/events/furiousflower/2016/11/10-lauren-alleyne.shtml|title=Lauren K.

This is a '''list of unrecognized higher education accreditation organizations''', as identified by the organizations themselves, government authorities in their respective countries, or other independent authorities. This article includes entities that are engaged in [[higher education accreditation]] or have been identified as being accreditors, but which lack appropriate recognition or authorization.

Prerequisites and rules for higher education accreditation vary from country to country. In most countries, the function of [[quality assurance]] for higher education institutions is conducted by a government ministry of education.&lt;ref name=Eaton/&gt; However in the United States, educational accreditation is performed primarily by private [[nonprofit]] membership associations,&lt;ref name="CapTimes"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050312020754/http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/index.php?ntid=28423&amp;ntpid=3 Diploma mills provide phony credentials], By Helena Andrews, ''[[The Capital Times]]''/[[Medill News Service]], February 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the legitimacy of which is validated through recognition by the [[United States Department of Education]] (USDE), the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA), or both.&lt;ref name=CHEAlist/&gt; USDE and CHEA recognize many of the independent accrediting organizations, but not all. Accreditors seek USDE or CHEA recognition for different reasons; for example, USDE recognition is required for accreditors whose institutions or programs seek eligibility for federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|student aid]] funds. CHEA recognition confers an academic legitimacy on accrediting organizations, helping to solidify the place of these organizations and their institutions and programs in the national higher education community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview of U.S. Accreditation |url=http://www.chea.org/pdf/overview_US_accred_8-03.pdf |page=7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804003555/http://www.chea.org/pdf/overview_US_accred_8-03.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, a school relying on accreditation from an unrecognized accrediting body will not be viewed as legitimate in the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/fact_sheet_6_diploma_mills.pdf Important Questions about "Diploma Mills" and "Accreditation Mills"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331224450/http://chea.org/pdf/fact_sheet_6_diploma_mills.pdf |date=2010-03-31 }}, Council for Higher Education Accreditation, Fact Sheet 6, May 2003. Retrieved October 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutional accreditation is usually required by US institutions to receive federal government funds.&lt;ref name=Eaton/&gt; Also, students who attend institutions of higher education that are accredited through organizations not recognized by the USDE or CHEA do not qualify for US government financial aid.&lt;ref name=Eaton&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070804003555/http://www.chea.org/pdf/overview_US_accred_8-03.pdf An Overview of U.S. Accreditation], by Judith S. Eaton, CHEA. Archived August 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, employers or graduate programs cannot be confident that graduates of an unaccredited institution or program will be appropriately prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHEA - Value of US Accreditation (FAQ)|url=http://www.chea.org/pdf/Value%20of%20US%20Accreditation%2006.29.2010_buttons.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201020048/http://chea.org/pdf/Value%20of%20US%20Accreditation%2006.29.2010_buttons.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 December 2010|accessdate=23 August 2012|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To assist education consumers, several national and international bodies publish lists of recognized accreditation bodies and accredited educational institutions, as well as lists of other accreditors that are known to lack the necessary legal authority or recognition, and higher education providers known to lack accreditation.&lt;ref name=Lantero/&gt; The United States organization CHEA maintains an international directory of education ministries and other recognized higher education [[quality assurance]] bodies worldwide. The 2007 version of that directory lists 467 recognized bodies in 175 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/intdb/international_directory.asp CHEA International Directory introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420041706/http://chea.org/intdb/international_directory.asp |date=2011-04-20 }}, accessed November 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Many, but not all, of the entities in the list below are considered to be fraudulent [[accreditation mill]]s that were set up to help diploma mills lure students and whose "accreditation" has no legal or academic value.  Some diploma and degree mills have played a role in creating these accrediting bodies as well.  These diploma and degree mills may further confuse matters by claiming to consider work history, professional education, or previous learning, and may even require the submission of a purported dissertation or thesis, in order to give an added appearance of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bogus Institutions and Accrediting Bodies|url=http://www.transcriptresearch.com/Bogus.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other listed entities are religious accreditation bodies, whose accreditation may have [[religious doctrine|doctrinal]] significance but lacks recognized academic value.&lt;ref name=degreenet/&gt;

Also included are some organizations that do not offer [[educational accreditation]] but have been falsely identified as accrediting bodies by organizations that claim to have been accredited by them. A notable example of this last type is [[UNESCO]], which does not have authority to recognize or accredit higher education institutions or agencies.&lt;ref name=Lantero /&gt; Nonetheless, because [[diploma mill]]s have claimed false UNESCO accreditation, UNESCO itself has published warnings against education organizations that claim UNESCO recognition or affiliation.&lt;ref name=Lantero&gt;Luca Lantero, [http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf Degree Mills: non-accredited and irregular higher education institutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513185433/http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf |date=2015-05-13 }}, [[Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence|Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence (CIMEA)]], Italy. "On Unesco's website a warning has also been published regarding all institutions that claim to be recognized by them, but which are actually not. As Unesco make clear in their communiqué, they do not have the power to accredit any higher education institutions or agencies; as a consequence, institutions or agencies claiming to be recognized by Unesco has to be looked upon with suspicion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=48787&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO "Alert: Misuse of UNESCO Name by Bogus Institutions"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, UNESCO website, accessed 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Living Values Education: A Values Based Awareness Educational Programme''' [LVEP] originally began as an outreach programme for the [[BKWSU|Brahma Kumaris]] religious organization.  In 1999, divested from "BK" LVEP became a stand alone USA nonprofit corporation, Living Values:  An Educational Program, Inc. (LVEP, Inc.)established to further develop and disseminate the programmes worldwide. With growing international representation, came the formation of an international coordinating organization (ALIVE) in 2004.  As of November 2018, Living Values Education through ALIVE has some 30 Associate representative country organisations and 15 country Focal Points, individuals representing the programmes. Over 40 countries in all regions of the world are involved in extending Values awareness to all age groups with emphasis of school education, special "At Risk" interest areas, Refugee, Street Children, Earthquake, War Victims etc., plus a Distance programme providing free download material from the LVE website - www.livingvalues.net to anyone seeking to explore Values in their lives, community, school classroom etc.,

==Activities==
LVE provides professional development courses and educational resource materials to help educators help young people explore and develop universal values, according to the cultural background. The twelve values being: freedom, cooperation, tolerance, happiness, honesty, love, peace, humility, respect, responsibility, simplicity, and unity which can be expressed in life through attitude, behavior and relationships. The educational program helps children, youth, educators and parents to understand, develop and share values in daily life.

Living Values Education (LVE) is a way of conceptualizing education that promotes the development of values-based learning communities and places the search for meaning and purpose at the heart of education.  LVE emphasizes the worth and integrity of each person involved in the provision of education, in the home, school and community.  In fostering quality education, LVE supports the overall development of the individual and a culture of positive values in each society and throughout the world, believing that education is a purposeful activity designed to help humanity flourish. [13]

The implementation of Living Values Education is facilitated by the Association for Living Values Education International (ALIVE), a non-profit-making association of organizations around the world concerned with values education. Drawing on a strong volunteer base, the advancement and implementation of Living Values Education is supported by UNESCO and a host of other organizations, agencies, governmental bodies, foundations, community groups and individuals. It is part of the global movement for a culture of peace in the framework of the United Nations International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. ALIVE groups together national bodies promoting Living Values Education and is an independent organization that does not have any particular or exclusive religious, political or national affiliation or interest. [13] 
 
In 2001, LVE's series of five books won 'The Teachers' Choice Award' by 'Learning Magazine',[5] a national publication in the USA for teachers and educators. Separate programmes exist for children at risk including refugees and Children Affected by War (LVARCAW), street children, [6]   youth in need of [[drug rehabilitation]] and young offenders. The Ministry of Labor in Vietnam noted in March 2008 that LVE’ drug rehabilitation program was the most successful drug rehab program in government rehabilitation clinics in the country. [13]

'''Mason Morgan''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Orpheus Pledger]]. The actor relocated to Sydney from Melbourne upon being offered the role. He began filming his first scenes in early December 2015. Pledger made his first appearance as Mason during the episode broadcast on 7 June 2016. 

Mason was introduced to the show along with his three older siblings; [[Tori Morgan]] ([[Penny McNamee]]), [[Justin Morgan (Home and Away)|Justin Morgan]] ([[James Stewart (Australian actor)|James Stewart]]) and [[Brody Morgan]] ([[Jackson Heywood]]). Mason is portrayed as being a positive, family orientated "free spirit". He is studying to be a doctor like his sister, who he shares a close bond with. For the first few weeks after their arrival, Mason and his siblings concealed the fact that they were in [[witness protection]]. Mason was the first member of the family to reveal the secret, which resulted in them being held hostage. 

Subsequent storylines for Mason have revolved around his romantic relationships with [[Evelyn MacGuire]] (Phillipa Northeast), [[Olivia Fraser Richards]] ([[Raechelle Banno]]), and [[Beth Ellis (Home and Away)|Beth Ellis]] (Anneliese Apps), with the latter helping to bring awareness to [[organ donation in Australia]]. The character has also been used to show the effects of temporary [[paralysis]], after he is injured in a car crash with his brother Brody.

==Casting==
On 5 December 2015, Jonathon Moran from ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported actors [[Orpheus Pledger]], [[Jackson Heywood]] and [[James Stewart (Australian actor)|James Stewart]] had joined the cast of ''Home and Away'' as brothers Mason, Brody and Justin Morgan respectively.&lt;ref name="Moran"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/jessica-marais-and-ex-james-stewart-go-head-to-head-on-rival-networks/story-fni0cvc9-1227635050696|title=Jessica Marais and ex James Stewart go head-to-head on rival networks|last=Moran|first=Jonathon|date=5 December 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family drew immediate comparisons to the show's Braxton brothers, who were introduced to the show in 2011.&lt;ref name="Moran"/&gt; All three actors began filming their first scenes during the following week, ahead of their on-screen debut in 2016.&lt;ref name="Moran"/&gt; Pledger was living with his mother and brother in Melbourne when he was offered the role of Mason, which required him to move to Sydney, where the show's studios are located.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/94881321/home-and-aways-orpheus-pledges-big-things-to-come-for-good-boy-mason|title=Home And Away's Orpheus pledges big things to come for good boy Mason|last=Harvey|first=Kerry|date=24 July 2017|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pledger said his 2011 role as [[Noah Parkin]] on fellow Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'' helped him prepare for the workload and the pace of filming.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; Pledger made his first appearance on 7 June 2016, alongside Heywood and Stewart.&lt;ref name="Knox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/05/james-stewart-heads-up-new-home-away-family.html|title=James Stewart heads up new Home &amp; Away family|last=Knox|first=David|date=12 May 2016|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
===Characterisation and introduction===
Ahead of his screen debut, Pledger described Mason as having a "positive outlook on life", being family orientated, and "a hopeless romantic".&lt;ref name="Knox"/&gt; He also said Mason "leads with his gut and stands up for what he believes in and will always stick up for the little guy."&lt;ref name="Knox"/&gt; Pledger later called his character "a free spirit" and a positive person to be around.&lt;ref name="Cromarty"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cromarty|first=Ali|last2=Downie|first2=Stephen|date=4–10 June 2016|title=Meet the Morgans|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=23|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor explained that following the death of their parents, Mason's siblings helped him to grow up and unlike them, Mason has not had to take on many responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Cromarty"/&gt; Of the comparisons to the Braxton brothers, Heywood said the Morgans had a different dynamic, while Pledger added that family comes first for the Morgans.&lt;ref name="Meet"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=23–29 July 2016|title=Meet the Morgans!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=29|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason is a medical student, who struggles to fit in a social life in between studying and working out in the gym.&lt;ref name="Knox"/&gt; Pledger called Tori a good role model for Mason and as a result, they share a very close relationship.&lt;ref name="Cromarty"/&gt; 

Pledger shares some similarities with Mason, particularly his dedication to attaining his dream job. The actor explained, "I've done that in my life with acting. Maybe it's not the same formality as studying to be a doctor and having to do a seven-year introduction to it before you even start but, definitely, if I was passionate about it, I would definitely do it."&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; The character's appearance changed in 2017 when Pledger shaved his "trademark" curly hair in favour of a shorter haircut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a816366/home-and-away-mason-morgan-looks-different-after-losing-curls-haircut/|title=Home and Away's Mason Morgan is looking very different after losing his curls|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=8 December 2016|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pledger later said that he thought a shorter haircut was best for his character at that point, but that he was beginning to grow it longer for Mason again.&lt;ref name="YouAsk"&gt;{{cite journal|date=19–25 May 2018|title=You ask... they answer! Orpheus Pledger faces your questions!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=20|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mason, Justin and Brody, along with their dog [[Buddy (Home and Away)|Buddy]], are almost involved in a car crash with [[Martin Ashford (Home and Away)|Martin "Ash" Ashford]] ([[George Mason (actor)|George Mason]]) while they are driving to [[Summer Bay]] to join their sister, Tori.&lt;ref name="FaceOff"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=4–10 June 2016|title=Face off!|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=23|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ash swerves across the road in front of them while texting. After coming to a stop, Justin immediately gets out of the car to confront Ash, and Brody and Mason desperately try to keep them from getting into a physical fight.&lt;ref name="FaceOff"/&gt; The Morgans continue their journey to the Bay, where they find Ash talking with Tori and [[Alf Stewart]] ([[Ray Meagher]]) on the beach and another fight almost breaks out, until Tori reveals that Justin, Brody and Mason are her brothers.&lt;ref name="FaceOff"/&gt; Ash accepts that he was in the wrong, while Justin is glad his family have made it to the Bay safely. The siblings also wonder if they will be able to stay in their new home, leading to the start of their first major storyline.&lt;ref name="FaceOff"/&gt;

===Witness protection===
An ''[[Inside Soap]]'' columnist observed that the Morgans had been hiding something about their past from the Bay's residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=13–19 August 2016|title=The Morgans' history revealed!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=32|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They initially keep to themselves and Justin warns Tori against befriending local doctor [[Nate Cooper]] ([[Kyle Pryor]]). Stewart explained that there were a set of rules that the Morgans had to live by, which related to their secret.&lt;ref name="Secret"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=25 June – 1 July 2016|title=The secret is out!|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=26|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying at home one day, Mason is visited by his former girlfriend [[Lara Adams]] (Elle Harris). Lara tells Mason off for not staying in contact with her. Justin arrives home shortly after and finds Lara and Mason together.&lt;ref name="Blast"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=11–17 June 2016|title=Blast from the past|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=24|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He orders Lara to leave, while warning Mason that he has compromised the family. Stewart confirmed that Justin's reaction had something to do with the family's secret.&lt;ref name="Blast"/&gt; Lara comes to the hospital to see Mason, who asks her to leave in case she is seen. Later, while he is looking for Lara, Mason comes across an upset [[Evelyn MacGuire]] (Philippa Northeast) and he comforts her. Lara sees them together and assumes Mason is also dating Evie. In an effort to reconnect with Lara, Mason tells her that his family are in [[witness protection]]. Later that day, Brody mentions that he is being followed, so Mason admits that he told Lara about their secret. Justin decides that they need to pack up and leave.&lt;ref name="Secret"/&gt;

After Tori is threatened by [[Spike Lowe]] (Jason Montgomery), the family's police liaison officer [[Atticus Decker]] ([[John Adam (actor)|John Adam]]) has them moved to a [[safe house]]. As they wait to find out where they will be moved to next, the family agree that they are tired of running from the people who killed their parents.&lt;ref name="Witless"&gt;{{cite journal|date=27 August – 2 September 2016|title=Witless protection|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=34|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his siblings begin arguing, Mason slips outside to meet up with Lara. However, he soon learns that she is working for Spike and [[Blaine Varden]] (Ashley Lyons), the man who killed the Morgan's parents. Spike and Blaine trick Mason into telling them where the safe house is and they hold the family hostage.&lt;ref name="Witless"/&gt; Blaine produces a gun and threatens to kill them all, before revealing that Justin knew the truth about the circumstances that led to their parents' deaths.&lt;ref name="Witless"/&gt; Mason is one of nine characters involved in a plane crash, after Spike sabotages a plane being used for Tori's birthday trip. Justin attempts to warn the pilot, [[Duncan Stewart (Home and Away)|Duncan Stewart]] ([[Benedict Wall]]), but a broken pipe leaks carbon dioxide into the cabin and everyone passes out. However, Duncan does manage to crash land the plane in the sand first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cromarty|first=Ali|date=20–26 August 2016|title=Plane crash horror|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=34|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the passengers escape major injury, Mason is "panic-stricken" when he realises that Brody is missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a808065/soap-spoilers-home-and-aways-explosive-plane-crash-leaves-brody-morgan-feared-dead/|title=Soap spoilers: Home and Away's Brody Morgan is feared dead after explosive plane crash|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=17 September 2016|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later developments in the storyline saw the Morgans meet Decker's nieces [[Hope Morrison|Hope]] ([[Jessica Falkholt]]) and [[Raffy Morrison]] (Olivia Deeble). They soon realise that Raffy could be their half-sister, after Decker admits to having an affair with their mother.&lt;ref name="Hope"&gt;{{cite journal|date=26 November – 2 December 2016|title=No Hope!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=47|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA test confirms their suspicions, but before they tell Raffy, Hope steals Mason's car and attempts to leave town with her.&lt;ref name="Hope"/&gt; The Morgans eventually tell Raffy she is their half-sister and that they had to go into witness protection because their parents were killed by drug dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a819951/soap-spoilers-home-and-away-morgan-secret-threat-tori-nate-romance/|title=Soap spoilers: Home and Away's Morgan family secret comes under threat, while Tori goes for it with Nate|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=28 January 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Morgan's secret is soon revealed to the rest of the Bay in the local newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=10–16 December 2016|title=On with the showdown!|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=50|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
====Evelyn MacGuire====
Mason shares a drunken kiss with Evie after a night out. The following week, they have dinner together and Mason confronts Evie about her drinking and partying. However, instead of talking to him about her issues, Evie just kisses Mason again and they have sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cromarty|first=Ali|date=30 July – 5 August 2016|title=Girl just wants to have fun|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=31|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They agree to a [[Casual sex|friends with benefits]] arrangement.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Kerry|date=22 October – 4 November 2016|title=Booty call!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=386|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason becomes concerned when Evie insists that she survived the plane crash because her deceased brother [[Oscar MacGuire]] (Jake Speer) is watching over her.&lt;ref name="LostAtSea"&gt;{{cite journal|date=8–14 October 2016|title=Evie lost at sea!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=40|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determined to prove her theory, Evie takes Mason out in her car and begins driving recklessly, as she is convinced that she will not crash. Mason is "petrified" by her stunt and when they stop, he "lets rip at her".&lt;ref name="LostAtSea"/&gt; Mason eventually develops feelings for Evie, but she reacts angrily to his admission and tells him she is not interested in a relationship with him.&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt; A reporter for ''The Daily Telegraph'' noted the arrangement would not last long, after Northeast was photographed filming a kissing scene with Alec Snow, who plays [[Matt Page]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/home-and-away-interesting-storylines-ahead-for-evie-matt-and-leah-as-things-get-heated-on-set/news-story/3f97ee9832e0b056c3a624749c414509?nk=cfb429b18655ca0e93ccfee99540e4e4-1522766860|title=Home and Away: Interesting storylines ahead for Evie, Matt and Leah as things get heated on set|date=8 September 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Olivia Fraser Richards====
[[File:Raechelle Banno 2.jpg|thumb|155px|right|Mason is involved in a love triangle when he dates Olivia Fraser Richards, played by Raechelle Banno (''pictured'').]]
Producers later paired Mason with [[Olivia Fraser Richards]] ([[Raechelle Banno]]) and formed a love triangle storyline with her ex-boyfriend [[Hunter King (Home and Away)|Hunter King]] (Scott Lee).&lt;ref name="Dilemma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=10–16 December 2016|title=Olivia's romance dilemma|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=50|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason shows an interest in dating Olivia and she is "drawn to him".&lt;ref name="Dilemma"/&gt; Pledger told Alison Gardner of ''[[What's on TV]]'' that Mason "really likes" Olivia and readily accepts her invitation to accompany her to the [[Prom#Oceania|formal]].&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/home-away/home-away-news/mason-girl-home-away-453239/|title=Mason gets his girl in Home and Away. Or does he? Orpheus Pledger reveals all|last=Gardner|first=Alison|date=6 March 2017|work=[[What's on TV]]|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair soon learn that Hunter is also attending, and Mason realises that Olivia still has feelings for him.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; Olivia leaves Mason at the bar and begins dancing with Hunter, but she explains that she was just passing the time while she waited for Mason to return.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; Pledger continued, "As the evening goes on, it's clear Olivia's still into Hunter. Mason's had so much to deal with because of his family's problems that he doesn't need Olivia to bring him even more heartache."&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; The following morning, Olivia visits Mason at the lifeguard station, where he is starting his new job, to tell him that what happened with Hunter meant nothing, but Mason replies that he does not need any more stress in his life. Later that day, Mason gets into a fight with Hunter. Pledger said that Mason "acts completely out of character" when he hits Hunter and is left feeling ashamed after Alf breaks up the fight.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt;

Olivia asks Mason if they can start their relationship over, but Mason rejects the idea. However, when they attend the Summer Grooves music festival, Mason and Olivia kiss.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; Olivia later admits to Mason that she is worried about Hunter's decision not to return to school and he attempts to talk to Hunter, as he is annoyed that she is worrying about him all the time. They pair have to separated by Alf again, and Lee commented that while Hunter does not have a friendship with Mason, he wants to get better at dealing with things. Mason and Olivia are soon caught having sex at the Summer Bay Auto garage by Brody and [[Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=4–10 February 2017|title=Man under fire|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=5|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mason comes to The Diner to help Olivia out, he notices she is acting strangely. He soon learns from Alf that Hunter helped Olivia at The Diner the night before, leaving Olivia feeling guilty she did not tell Mason herself. Mason then confronts Hunter and asks him if he wants to get back together with Olivia, but Hunter says no.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cullen|first=Tamara|last2=Downie|first2=Stephen|date=18–24 February 2017|title=Close encounters|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=7|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason and Olivia's relationship becomes strained as he worries that she still has feelings for Hunter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cullen|first=Tamara|last2=Downie|first2=Stephen|date=4–10 March 2017|title=Three's a crowd|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=9|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when she admits that he is right, but wants to still date him, Mason breaks up with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/shows/home-and-away/watch/34490222/mason-olivia-breakup-hunter-home-and-away/|title=Breaking up|publisher=[[Yahoo7]]|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beth Ellis====
A new love interest for Mason was introduced in the form of guest character [[Beth Ellis (Home and Away)|Beth Ellis]] (Anneliese Apps) in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/06/27/home-and-away-spoilers-all-the-rumoured-new-arrivals-at-the-bay-this-summer-6737439/|title=Home and Away spoilers: All the rumoured new arrivals at the Bay this summer|last=Groome|first=Imogen|date=27 June 2017|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth tells Mason that she is a nurse and they soon bond while he is a patient in the hospital. Beth's friendship helps Mason's recovery from injuries he sustained in a car crash.&lt;ref name="Dying"&gt;{{cite journal|date=30 September – 6 October 2017|title=Dying to know you|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=39|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While looking for Beth, Mason soon learns that she is actually a patient. Mason is "furious" that Beth has lied to him, but she soon reveals that she is dying.&lt;ref name="Dying"/&gt; Beth explains that she needs a heart transplant, after being diagnosed with a serious heart condition five years prior. Mason urges Beth not to give up hope that she will get the transplant and they share "a heartfelt moment", which led a ''[[New Idea (magazine)|New Idea]]'' columnist to speculate that they could be more than just friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newidea.com.au/home-and-away-mason-and-beth-storyline|title=Home and Away heartache: I'm dying|last=Black|first=Nikki|date=11 September 2017|work=[[New Idea (magazine)|New Idea]]|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason later asks Beth out on a date and she accepts. Of their romance, Pledger told Tamara Cullen of ''[[TV Week]]'', "Beth brings out the best in Mason. He's playful and has no inhibitions with her."&lt;ref name="TCullen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cullen|first=Tamara|date=23–29 September 2017|title=Taking chances|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=38|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mason finds Beth's [[wikt:bucket list|bucket list]], she tells him that she accepts that she is not getting any better and is starting to reconsider her treatment. When Mason tries to reassure her that she will be fine, Beth gets angry and Mason is forced to apologise.&lt;ref name="TCullen"/&gt; He then surprises her with a champagne lunch, where they bond further and kiss. Pledger commented, "Mason has never had a connection with anyone else like this."&lt;ref name="TCullen"/&gt;

Mason finds Beth's bucket list and sees that she has fun and "romantically charged" things on it, which Mason wants to help her complete. Mason comes up with the idea of a [[James Bond]] style trip to the casino.&lt;ref name="Chance"&gt;{{cite journal|date=14–20 October 2017|title=Take a chance on love|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=41|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the journey, Beth passes out while she driving. Mason is "petrified" and worried about the harm to Beth's health. He is also left feeling helpless as he cannot do anything about her condition.&lt;ref name="Chance"/&gt; Mason asks to meets Beth's parents, but she is reluctant. However, Mason later meets Beth and her father [[List of Home and Away characters (2017)#Alan Ellis|Alan Ellis]] ([[Blair McDonough]]) at the beach, so he introduces himself. Alan is unaware that his daughter is dating anyone, but he invites Mason to lunch with Beth and her mother [[List of Home and Away characters (2017)#Jackie Ellis|Jackie]] ([[Rachael Coopes]]), where Mason tries to make a good impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=21–27 October 2017|title=Mason on the spot!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=42|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Apps and Pledger hoped Beth and Mason's storyline would raise more awareness about organ donation in Australia.&lt;ref name="Plea"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newidea.com.au/home-and-aways-anneliese-apps-orpheus-pledger-raise-awareness-organ-donation|title=Home And Away: Young stars' desperate plea|date=22 October 2017|work=[[New Idea (magazine)|New Idea]]|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pledger also thought the plot could increase the amount of people willing to be organ donors.&lt;ref name="Plea"/&gt; Both actors found the storyline tough to film, with Pledger calling it "a harrowing experience".&lt;ref name="Plea"/&gt; The storyline concludes with Beth's death. Mason wants to make the most of the time they have left and organises a lunch on the beach. But Beth collapses and Mason rushes her to the hospital, where she tells him she loves him. Beth goes into cardiac arrest and dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=11–17 October 2017|title=Torn apart!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=45|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paralysis===
Mason becomes a victim of his brother Brody's drug addiction when they are in a car crash together, which leaves him with temporary paralysis.

==Storylines==
Mason, Brody and Justin Morgan join their sister Tori in Summer Bay. Mason and Brody have to stop Justin from fighting Martin "Ash" Ashford, who almost ran them off the road. Days after their arrival, Mason's former girlfriend Lara Adams visits him and they have sex. Justin catches them together and warns Lara to stay away. Mason confronts Justin, forcing Brody to stop them from fighting. Mason starts working at Brody's restaurant as a waiter, while he is also given a placement at the local hospital, where he clashes with his supervisor Nate Cooper. Lara sees Mason comforting Evie MacGuire and when she threatens to break up with him, Mason tells Lara that his family is in witness protection, as their parents were murdered by a drug syndicate. After their cover is exposed, the Morgans leave the Bay for a safe house. Mason slips outside to see Lara, but he is kidnapped by Spike Lowe and Blaine Varden, who Lara has been working for. Blaine threatens to kill the Morgans, before revealing that Justin knew that their father was working for the syndicate and that their mother sacrificed herself to save him. Lara frees Mason and the family are saved by the police and their federal protection officer, Decker. Mason and Tori ask Justin to leave the house, after learning that he lied to them.

Mason helps Evie out with a charity sleepover at Summer Bay High. They kiss, but she pulls away and he apologises. When Evie gets drunk at a university party, Mason brings her home and lets her stay on his sofa. While they are studying together, Mason and Evie have sex. They both admit that they are not over their former partners and agree to a friends with benefits arrangement. During a plane trip for Tori's birthday, a carbon monoxide leak causes the passengers and captain to pass out. The plane crashes into the desert and Mason has to treat a pregnant [[Billie Ashford]] ([[Tessa de Josselin]]), whose amniotic sac is damaged. Mason burns his arm when he pushes Evie out of the way of a fuel explosion. Evie insists that she was saved by her deceased brother and tries to prove that he is protecting her by driving dangerously with Mason in the car. Mason is forced to apply the handbrake to stop them from crashing. Mason realises he has feelings for Evie and wants more than a casual relationship with her. He eventually ends their arrangement. The Morgans learn Decker's niece Raffy Morrison is actually his daughter and their half-sister. Mason is in favour of telling Raffy the truth and attempts to make her feel like part of the family. 

After noticing Olivia Fraser Richards arguing with her former boyfriend Hunter King, Mason asks her to go for a walk with him. He asks her out on a date, but she turns him down as she is not ready for a new relationship. Olivia invites Mason to escort her to her formal as friends, where she spends most of the night talking and dancing with Hunter. Mason begins working as a lifeguard and gets into a fight with Hunter on his first day. Mason helps Brody out at the Summer Grooves music festival, and he and Olivia kiss, before leaving to go skinny dipping. Mason and Olivia start dating, but he worries that she still has feelings for Hunter. The couple are later caught having sex at Summer Bay Auto. Olivia eventually admits to Mason that she does still have feelings for Hunter, but she wants to carry on dating him; however, Mason breaks up with her. Olivia later sets Mason up with her friend [[Lena Ascot]] (Felicity McKay), but nothing comes of it after he finds her dealing drugs at a party. Brody later develops a drug addiction and Mason has to take him to the hospital when he is beaten by his dealer. Mason is forced to work with Hunter at the surf club, where they clash again. Mason refuses to fight Hunter when he challenges him and they eventually become friends. 

Mason realises Brody is suffering a relapse and drives him to rehab. Brody panics when he sees his dealer following them and grabs the wheel, causing the car to crash. Mason suffers spinal damage and is placed on life support. When he wakes, he realises that he has little feeling in his legs. Beth Ellis visits Mason and cheers him up. She tells him she is a nurse, but Mason soon learns she is a patient, who has [[cardiomyopathy]] and needs a heart transplant. Mason helps Beth to complete some things on her bucket list and they kiss. While driving to a casino, Beth collapses and Mason is forced to drive to get help. He later meets Beth's parents and her father Alan asks him to stay away from her, but he changes his mind. Mason and Beth have sex, but Beth collapses at the pier later that night. Mason tries to get her moved up the transplant list and pressures a car crash victim's husband into donating her heart. A complaint is made against him and his placement at the hospital is cancelled. Mason takes Beth out for lunch on the beach where he gives her an eternity ring. However, Beth becomes breathless and Mason rushes her back to the hospital. She goes into cardiac arrest and dies. Mason later sees visions of Beth and attempts to complete the rest of her bucket list.

After quitting his university course in the wake of Beth's death, Mason applies for the manager's job at the gym. [[Willow Harris]] ([[Sarah Roberts (actress)|Sarah Roberts]]) also applies and [[John Palmer (Home and Away)|John Palmer]]'s ([[Shane Withington]]) gives it to them both. Mason gives [[Jennifer Dutton]] (Brittany Santariga) a private boxing lesson and she kisses him, but he pulls away and she makes it seem that he had made an unwelcome advance towards her as Hunter walks in. She apologises after Mason tells her about Beth. Mason befriends [[Jasmine Delaney]] ([[Sam Frost (TV personality)|Sam Frost]]) and they bond over their respective medical careers. Mason decides to return to university and he is allowed to continue his placement at Northern Districts hospital.

==Reception==
Jonathon Moran of ''The Daily Telegraph'' predicted that Pledger "will no doubt be a hit with the young female fans with his buff body."&lt;ref name="Moran"/&gt; Sarah Ellis from ''Inside Soap'' branded Mason, Brody and Justin "another trio of troublesome brothers". She also noted their appearances, dubbing them "a tasty trio" and "hunky".&lt;ref name="Meet"/&gt; Ali Cromarty and Stephen Downie of ''TV Week'' were impressed by the brothers, commenting, "Move over Braxtons, there's a new family of hot brothers in Summer Bay."&lt;ref name="Cromarty"/&gt; They also called them "loyal, caring and hard-working".&lt;ref name="Cromarty"/&gt; Downie later called the siblings "the mysterious Morgan brothers" and pointed out that they landed in "a whole lot of trouble" upon their arrival.&lt;ref name="FaceOff"/&gt; Daniel Kilkelly from ''Digital Spy'' dubbed the Morgans "Summer Bay's unluckiest family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a811016/soap-spoilers-home-and-away-justin-morgan-showdown-chris-harrington-exit/|title=Soap spoilers: Home and Away's Justin Morgan faces a violent showdown, and there's big news from Chris|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=15 October 2016|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for Stuff.co.nz, Kerry Harvey dubbed Mason "Summer Bay's good boy" and observed that he was "chilled-out".&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; She also named him "the most sensible member of the Morgan clan".&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

The '''Ministry of Education''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: ''Te Tāhuhu o te Mātauranga'') is the public service department of New Zealand charged with overseeing the [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand education system]].

The Ministry was formed in 1989 when the former, all-encompassing Department of Education was broken up into six separate agencies.

== History ==
{{See also|History of education in New Zealand}}
The Ministry was established as a result of the [[Picot task force]] set up by the Labour government in July 1987 to review the New Zealand education system. The members were Brian Picot, a businessman, Peter Ramsay, an associate professor of education at the [[University of Waikato]], Margaret Rosemergy, a senior lecturer at the Wellington College of Education, [[Whetumarama Wereta]], a social researcher at the [[Department of Maori Affairs]] and Colin Wise, another businessman.{{sfn|Fiske|Ladd|2000|pp=48}}
The task force was assisted by staff from the Treasury and the State Services Commission (SSC), who may have applied pressure on the task force to move towards eventually privatizing education, as had happened with other government services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/nzaroe/1992/pdf/text-dale.pdf |title=Mainstreaming Education: The Role of the State Services Commission |author=Roger Dale and Joce Jesson |work=''New Zealand Annual Review of Education'', 7, 7-34 |year=1993 |accessdate=2010-12-13 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate was to review management structures and cost-effectiveness, but did not include curriculum, teaching or effectiveness. In nine months the commission received input from over 700 people or organizations.{{sfn|Levin|2001|pp=44}}

The Picot task force released its report ''Administering for Excellence: Effective Administration in Education'' in May 1988.
The report was critical of the [[Department of Education (New Zealand)|Department of Education]], which it labelled as inefficient and unresponsive.
The task force conceived of the school charter as a contract between school boards, the local community and central authority and the government accepted many of the recommendations subsequently published in their response - ''[[Tomorrow's Schools]]''. This recommended a system where each school would be largely independent, governed by a board consisting mainly of parents, although subject to review and inspection by specialized government agencies.  Another recommendation was that boards of trustees were made responsible to the Minister of Education, who gained the power to dismiss boards.

The Picot report became the basis for a drawn out process of educational reform in New Zealand starting in 1989.{{sfn|Levin|2001|pp=45}} When National was elected in October 1990, it carried out a further series of educational reviews culminating in the publication ''Education Policy: Investing in People, Our Greatest Asset''. This resulted in further modifications to the structure of education reform, and according to one academic, created "a system which is a far cry from the Picot intentions... There has been an ongoing series of changes and reassessments that has caused chaos, confusion and massive insecurity throughout the education sector".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victoria.ac.nz/education/research/nzaroe/issues-index/1992/abstract-sullivan The Myth of Partnership: Educational Reform and Teacher Disempowerment]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Patrick Walsh, the outgoing president of the Secondary Principals' Association said that despite having about 3000 employees, the Ministry had underperformed for more than a decade. He said "in an era of self-managing schools we have a Ministry that is so large and yet not able to perform in an effective and efficient manner". Walsh said the Ministry's poor performance has been confirmed by a number of reviews conducted by the State Services Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10872838 Education ministry 'ineffective']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The Ministry's role is to raise the overall level of educational achievement and reduce disparity. It is not an education provider. That role is met by individual elected Boards of Trustees for every [[state school]] in the country. The ministry has numerous functions - advising government, providing information to the sector, providing learning resources, administering sector regulation and funding, and providing specialist services. The ministry works with other education agencies including the [[Education Review Office]], the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]] and [[Learning Media Limited]].

Although the Ministry's role is to raise the level of educational achievement, it is also the mechanism through which the Government of the day implements its education policy. When government changes aspects of its policy on education, the Ministry is responsible for implementing those changes. Sometimes the Ministry ends up in the difficult position of trying to implement political induced changes in education policy to which teachers, parents and boards of trustees may be totally opposed. Changes introduced by the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|National Government]] in 2011–2012 are an example.

In order for the Ministry to perform its role effectively, it is dependent on taxpayer funding provided by Government. When government increases funding or requires financial cutbacks, this also impacts on the ability of the Ministry to fulfil its role. In 2013, the Government provided about $12.2 billion to fund education in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10863686 Teachers want Government to 'come clean']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ministers ==
The Ministry serves 1 portfolio, 1 minister and 3 associate ministers.

'''Monographic series''' (alternatively, '''monographs in series''') are scholarly and scientific books released in successive volumes, each of which is structured like a separate book or [[monograph|scholarly monograph]].
[[File:Loeb Classical Library.jpg|thumb|A volume in the [[Loeb Classical Library]]. Each installment in this monographic series is devoted to a Greek or Latin author, and is accompanied by extensive commentary and notes from the editors.]]

==Semantics==
In general books that are released serially (in successive parts) once a year, or less often, are called [[Book series|series]]. Publications that are released more often than once a year are known as [[periodical]]s. If the volumes can each stand on their own as a separate book, they are called monographs in series, if not they are called '''book sets'''.

==Associations==
The connection among books belonging to such a series can be by discipline, focus, approach, type of work, or geographic location. Examples of such series include "Antwerp Working Papers in Linguistics";&lt;ref&gt;"Antwerp working papers in linguistics" {{OCLC|66592270}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile" (Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger, Copenhagen);&lt;ref&gt;Early English manuscripts in facsimile" {{ISSN|0070-7856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garland reference library; "Canterbury Tales Project" &lt;ref&gt;Garland reference library; "Canterbury Tales Project" {{ISSN|1351-3435}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''); [[Early English Text Society]].

The ''[[Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology]]'' (a series of 19th-century editions of theological works by [[Church of England]] writers, devoted to significant [[Anglo-Catholic]] figures,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Middleton, ''Fathers and Anglicans'' (2004), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[John Henry Parker]]) is an example of a common usage in naming monographic series; another example is the [[John Harvard Library (series)|John Harvard Library]] which consists of notable works relating to the United States. The [[Loeb Classical Library]] is a series of editions of Greek and Latin texts in which the original texts are accompanied by translations into English; the series was begun by James Loeb and is published by [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Lee Simmons, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222542/https://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=12377 Little Big Books: the red and green guides to the wisdom of the Ancient World]" in ''The Weekly Standard'' no. 40 (3 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Series intended for general readers may also have "library" in their titles, e.g. [[Everyman's Library]].

==Categorization==
Libraries and indexing services handle them in various ways. The [[Library of Congress]] catalogs each part of them as an individual book with an individual call number and [[ISBN]] and a series note (technically a series added entry for the overall series, which has its [[ISSN]], and usually a call number. As the Library of Congress receives two copies of most scholarly books as [[copyright]] deposits, it normally keeps one by individual call number and one by series call number. Most other libraries do not have that luxury and have to choose. The Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2nd edition allows either of these options to be used.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association, et al. ''Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules''; 2nd ed., edited by Michael Gorman and Paul W. Winkler. London: Library Association, 1976; ch. 2, sect. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medical library|Medical libraries]] almost always keep them together as a series. The biomedical indexing service [[PubMed]] from the [[National Library of Medicine]] treat the individual volumes in such a series as if they were volumes in a journal.

* ''[[Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology]]'' {{ISSN|0065-2598}}

==Themed volumes==
In many cases each volume in such a series itself contains individual chapters or articles written by different authors, usually on the same general theme. The Library of Congress does not list each such article separately, but PubMed does.

A frequent occasion for such a themed volume is a celebration in honor of a person's scholarly work. If done at retirement or on an anniversary (e.g. 60th birthday), it is usually called a [[Festschrift]] or celebration volume. If after death, it is usually called a [[memorial]].

The publisher Variorum Reprints began publishing its Collected Studies series in 1970. Each of these volumes contains "a selection of articles by a leading authority on a particular subject ... reprinted from a vast range of learned journals, [[Festschrifts]], conference proceedings ...". These volumes are published by [[Ashgate Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=1449|title=Variorum Collected Studies|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MormonLeaks''' (formerly '''Mormon WikiLeaks''') is a [[whistleblowing]] organization inspired by [[WikiLeaks]], which focuses on exposing documents from the leadership of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). It began in October 2016 as a leaked series of videos on the [[YouTube]] channel '''Mormon Leaks'''. In total, 15 videos were initially leaked via the Mormon Leaks channel from meetings of high-ranking LDS leaders including the [[Quorum of the Twelve]]. They discussed topics including the "[[homosexual agenda]]", the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], and a debate over the [[sexual orientation]] of [[Chelsea Manning]]. Politicians featured in the videos included former Utah governor [[Mike Leavitt]] and former U.S. Senator from Oregon [[Gordon H. Smith]].

Ryan McKnight, founder of MormonLeaks, was interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' about his YouTube channel Mormon Leaks, and this led to contacts from [[Reddit]] who asked him for a secure way to send files. He set up a website to allow whistleblowers to protect their [[anonymity]]. The submission process ensures [[confidentiality]], including erasure of [[IP address|IP addresses]], asking leakers to use the privacy browser [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], sending documents via [[SecureDrop]], and additional [[encryption]] methods. Initial funding was raised through [[GoFundMe]], and an official [[Twitter]] account was set up. The site's intent is to increase transparency of LDS Church leadership, and would not leak names of lower-level employees, instead focusing on the Quorum of the Twelve and the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]].

[[University of Tampa]] professor Ryan Cragun said scholars were interested in finding out what documents would be revealed, noting there was a dearth of information available about the [[Finances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|finances of the LDS Church]]. He said active Mormons were unlikely to view the leaked materials, but the material would have a more significant impact on those who were questioning or had already resigned their membership status. Mormon scholar and columnist [[Jana Riess]] gave a mixed assessment, criticizing their tactics regarding privacy while saying it could help to increase LDS Church leadership transparency. Utah attorney and Mormon blogger Steve Evans said the practice of leaking was criminal publication of stolen property, and said LDS Church employees who leaked material were likely violating a [[non-disclosure agreements|non-disclosure agreement]].

McKnight decided to found MormonLeaks so whistleblowers could protect their [[anonymity]].&lt;ref name=valkenburg /&gt; Since his increased attention from the October videos and the November policy change leaks, McKnight has been contacted by 25 sources inside and outside of the LDS Church with potential material to release.&lt;ref name=exmormoncreates /&gt; McKnight and his team spent six months planning creation of the organization.&lt;ref name=exmormoncreates /&gt; He estimated approximately a potential for between hundreds to thousands of additional invididuals who may wish to leak information through the site.&lt;ref name=notapproval /&gt; The organization has no affiliation with [[Fred Karger#LDS Church|Fred Karger]] or his website [http://mormontips.com/ MormonTips.com], which also publicizes confidential documents from the LDS Church.&lt;ref name=exmormoncreates /&gt; MormonLeaks takes steps to protect [[confidentiality]] of their sources, including erasing all IP addresses from submissions and removing watermarks from submitted materials.&lt;ref name=exmormoncreates /&gt; The site asks users who wish to submit secret documents to use the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor privacy browser]] to protect themselves.&lt;ref name=alexjohnson /&gt; Users then send the documents to MormonLeaks via [[SecureDrop]].&lt;ref name=notapproval&gt;{{citation|accessdate=December 21, 2016|date=December 20, 2016|url=http://gephardtdaily.com/local/mormonwikileaker-seeks-lds-church-transparency-not-approval/|work=Gephardt Daily|title=MormonWikiLeaker seeks LDS Church ‘transparency,’ not approval}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Encryption]] methods are further incorporated to mask the identity of the whistleblowers.&lt;ref name=tareqhaddad /&gt; The motivation behind the organization is to increase transparency of LDS Church leadership.&lt;ref name=sharesecret&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.kivitv.com/news/former-lds-member-starts-mormon-wikileaks-to-share-secret-church-documents|accessdate=December 21, 2016|date=December 20, 2016|title=Former LDS member starts Mormon Wikileaks to share secret church documents|work=[[KIVI-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sirinkale&gt;{{citation|first=Sirin|last=Kale|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/the-ex-mormon-exposing-the-lds-church-with-a-whistle-blowing-website|title=The Ex-Mormon Exposing the LDS Church With a Whistle-Blowing Website|date=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After MormonLeaks had posted a handful a number of LDS Church documents for four months, the Church sent a [[cease-and-desist letter]] alleging [[copyright infringement]] with regard to a leaked Church leadership [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] [[slide show|presentation]] published by MormonLeaks in February 2017. The PowerPoint discussed societal pressures that the Church felt had led some LDS members to apostasy, which included [[pornography]], the issues agitated for by [[Ordain Women]], and questions regarding [[Mormon history]] such as those promoted in books by lawyer&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;[[Fundamentalist Mormon]] [[Denver C. Snuffer Jr.|Denver Snuffer]] or in online postings by psychologist [[social critic]] [[John Dehlin]]. MormonLeaks pulled the offending document for a short while, until its attorney, [[Marc Randazza]], sent the LDS Church a letter which said, "At this point, my client is willing to let bygones be bygones. If your client is willing to step back from the brink, and to cease efforts to censor this material, my client is willing to refrain from bringing a claim [of abusing copyright law]."&lt;ref name=mormonleaksreposts&gt;{{citation|access-date=June 16, 2017|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/lds/5056058-155/mormonleaks-reposts-lds-church-apostasy-presentation|title=MormonLeaks reposts LDS Church apostasy presentation, rebuffs faith’s copyright violation claim|first=Bob|last=Mims|date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enemieslist&gt;{{citation|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/03/17/mormonleaks-website-squares-off-with-mormon-church-posts-leaked-enemies-list/|title=MormonLeaks website squares off with Mormon Church, posts leaked ‘Enemies List’|access-date=June 16, 2017|date=March 17, 2017|first= Michael Alison |last=Chandler}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[WikiLeaks]] was aware of the foundation under the site's original name of MormonWikiLeaks, and sent them a message on Twitter asking them to change their name.&lt;ref name=mandyvelez /&gt; The founder stated he would retain the name as MormonWikiLeaks, and said a trademark application was pending.&lt;ref name=mandyvelez /&gt;

[[University of Tampa]] professor Ryan Cragun said academics were excited to discover more information about the economics behind the LDS Church, as members tithe 10 percent of their earnings and there was not much in the way of transparent documents available to research their holdings and finances.&lt;ref name=chandler /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cragun said it was unlikely active members of the LDS Church would end up viewing the leaked documents because they were "highly insulated".&lt;ref name=chandler /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he notes documents would have a greater impact on someone who is considering leaving the LDS Church: "For someone in the middle of a faith transition, such information is more fuel for the fire."&lt;ref name=chandler /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Editor-in-chief]] of ''The Nonprofit Quarterly'', Ruth McCambridge, wrote that the appearance of MormonLeaks was reflective of an increasing trend by individuals to use technology to force nonprofit organizations to be transparent and accountable to the public.&lt;ref name=npq&gt;{{citation|issn=1934-6050|oclc=46351191|publisher=Nonprofit Information Networking Association|location=[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]|date=December 21, 2016|journal=The Nonprofit Quarterly|first=Ruth|last=McCambridge|accessdate=December 22, 2016|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/12/21/forcing-nonprofit-transparency-mormon-church-ends-wikileaks/|archivedate=December 22, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222045913/https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/12/21/forcing-nonprofit-transparency-mormon-church-ends-wikileaks/|title=Forcing Nonprofit Transparency: Mormon Church Ends Up with Its Own Wikileaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; MormonLeaks has an attorney on staff, which McCambridge notes may be beneficial given the prior litigation history where the LDS Church made a copyright infringement assertion against WikiLeaks for publishing the church's ''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook of Instructions]]''.&lt;ref name=npq /&gt;

Mormon scholar and columnist [[Jana Riess]] was critical of the organization's tactics, stating: "I am very concerned about privacy in our culture more generally. People in the workplace have the right to expect that intraoffice communication and their emails will stay private."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt; She called MormonLeaks "disturbing" and said: "It is not good news for any of us."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt; On a positive note, Riess said it could motivate the upper LDS Church leadership to increase its transparency.&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt;

Utah attorney and Mormon blogger Steve Evans called MormonLeaks "a rebranding exercise of McKnight's existing practice of posting various confidential items."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt; Evans said MormonLeaks had "an added layer of cybersecurity, which won't necessarily protect the leakers, depending on their methods of obtaining the various stolen documents, videos, etc."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt; Evans was critical of McKnight's encouragement to those who choose to leak information to MormonLeaks: "the leakers are likely either church employees or consultants working for the church. In either of those situations, it's very likely that the leakers are violating their nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with the church. McKnight is now publicly encouraging people to violate these agreements."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt;

'''My School ''' is a [[website]] administered by the [[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]] (ACARA) which provides access to information about Australian schools. Nearly 10,000 schools across Australia can be searched.&lt;ref name="detmsci"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.det.act.gov.au/school_education/my_school_website_information |title=My School Website Information |date=23 February 2012 |work= |publisher=ACT Department of Education and Training |accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site reports data from the annual [[National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy]] (NAPLAN) tests which compulsorily assess reading, writing, spelling, grammar, punctuation, and numeracy at years 3, 5, 7 and 9 for all Australian school students. It also displays information such as school missions, staffing, financial information, its resources and its students' characteristics.&lt;ref name="mswacara"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acara.edu.au/reporting/my_school_website_page.html |title=My School website |publisher=Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority |accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website does not allow users to directly compare schools of their choosing.&lt;ref name="fmtgt"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/in-depth/finding-meaning-the-greatest-test/story-fnd17met-1226320005793|title=Finding meaning the greatest test|author=Knapp|first=Peter|date=7 April 2012|newspaper=The Australian|accessdate=9 April 2012|publisher=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
The website went live at 1:00 am on 28 January 2010, but later in the morning the website became unavailable due to extremely high demand.&lt;ref name="mss"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-01-28/my-school-site-a-victim-of-its-own-success-gillard/312026|title=My School site a victim of its own success: Gillard|author=|date=28 January 2010|work=ABC News|accessdate=9 April 2012|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved on 9 April 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched by the then [[Minister for Education (Australia)|Minister for Education]], [[Julia Gillard]].&lt;ref name="fmtgt"/&gt;

==Update==
An update to the site was expected in December 2010, however its roll-out was delayed until March 2011.&lt;ref name="mswd"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-04/myschool-website-data-has-grave-inaccuracies/1966252 |title=MySchool website data has 'grave inaccuracies' |accessdate=9 April 2012 |date=4 March 2011 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary aim of the changes was to increase funding transparency.

==Opposition==
Teachers' unions and some parent bodies have expressed concerns that the data is being used to formulate [[league table]]s of schools. Principals claim that students have been asked to leave some schools because their performance on NAPLAN tests was expected to damage those schools' rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Leslie|date=24 March 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/25/2855409.htm|title=Principals unite against 'unfair' My School site|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent [[think tank]] the [[Grattan Institute]] calls for schools to be judged on the individual improvement students make every year rather than the comparison based on raw test scores used on My School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Justine|last=Ferrari|date=27 January 2010|url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/my-school-website-data-inaccurate-and-unfair/story-e6frg6nf-1225823772133|title=My School website data 'inaccurate and unfair'|work=The Australian|publisher=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Education Union]] has resolved to boycott future NAPLAN testing if the My School website is used in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/teachers-plan-test-boycott-over-league-table-fears-20100118-mgtb.html|title=Teachers plan test boycott over league table fears|last=Patty|first=Anna|date=19 January 2010|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=9 April 2012|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption allegations==
{{see also|2015 FIFA corruption case}}
In November 2010, [[Andrew Jennings]], the presenter of [[FIFA's Dirty Secrets]], an edition of [[BBC]]'s flagship current affairs programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' alleged that Leoz had taken bribes in the 1990s regarding the awarding of contracts for the sale of television rights to the football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783 |title=Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribes - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Panorama'' claimed to have obtained a confidential document from a company called ISL which showed that Leoz was paid $730,000 by the company. ISL won the contract to distribute the television rights.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Leoz has not responded to the allegations.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

In May 2011, Lord Triesman named Leoz while giving evidence at a Parliamentary inquiry into football governance in London. Nicolas Leoz has been accused of requesting an honorary knighthood in reward for supporting a World Cup bid for England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootballinsider.com/Story.aspx?id=34346 |title=Triesman Blows the Lid on Flawed World Cup Bid Process |publisher=Worldfootballinsider.com |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later revealed in email exchanges involving his aide that Leoz would consider visiting England if the [[FA Cup]], the oldest [[association football]] competition in the world, were to be named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/01/44/40/85/jdqcreview-summary.pdf |format=PDF |title=Review of Allegations of Misconduct in Relation to the FA's 2015 World Cup Bid : Summary of the Report to the FA |publisher=Fifa.com |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott |first=Robin |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/fifa-member-wanted-fa-cup-to-be-named-after-him-2291221.html |title=Fifa member 'wanted FA Cup to be named after him' - News &amp; Comment - Football |publisher=The Independent |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/924718/nicolas-leoz-aide-asked-for-fa-cup-to-be-named-after-him?cc=5739 |title=Nicolas Leoz aide asked for FA Cup to be named after him - ESPN FC |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2013, Leoz announced his resignation of CONMEBOL presidency to take place on April 30, 2013.

On June 3, 2015, Leoz was named on an INTERPOL Red Notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News/2015/N2015-071 |title=INTERPOL issues Red Notices for former FIFA officials and executives wanted by US authorities |publisher=www.interpol.int |date=2015-06-03 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

'''Nonsul (論述,writing test)''',one of the test formats of [[college entrance exams]] in [[South Korea]], basically means 'writing logically'- to read the given articles and write the answer to the questions. Additionally, it also includes a similar oral test format called 'Gusul(口述,oral test)' which needs logical and immediate interaction.

Nonsul has recently been positioned as one of the three main factors of entrance exams in Korea, which includes 'Haksaengbu(學生簿,GPA)' and '[[Suneung|Sunung]](修能,The Korean [[SAT]])' but Nonsul has only been adopted in 20 high-class universities, mostly because of the huge effort and time needed to fairly evaluate the answer sheets.

Usually, there are no official 'Nonsul' classes in regular schools so many students depend on private academies.

[[File:Petr Kvicala - portret.jpg|thumb|Petr Kvíčala]]
'''Petr Kvíčala''' (born 1960 in [[Svitavy]]) is one of the most significant personalities in Czech abstract [[non-picture painting]]. At the turn of the 1980s and 1990s he became a pioneer in discovering and promoting [[Ornament (art)|ornament]] as a unique individual phenomenon. He also significantly contributed to the acceptance of aesthetic qualities of visual art. Since 1995 he has undertaken commissions for architecture-related projects in which he has collaborated with a number of leading architects both from the Czech Republic and abroad. He has been a lecturer at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the Brno University of Technology, where he is in charge of a painting studio, since 1994. His works are represented in public and private collections.

== Life ==
[[File:Petr Kvicala - Plasy.JPG|thumb|left|Installation in Plasy convent, 1993]]
Petr Kvíčala was born in Svitavy in 1960. A serious interest in fine arts he developed during his studies at the Secondary Technical School of Chemistry, led to the attempt to transfer to a school with an artistic focus, that he was denied. A major impuls of Kvíčala’s artistic development came in the course of his compulsory military service in Janovice nad Úhlavou, where he met graduates of the Prague Academy of Fine Arts and began to draw portraits of other soldiers.

After finishing his military service, Kvíčala started Secondary School of Arts and Crafts in Brno, where he received a number of recommendations for his further study at the Academy. However, he was not permitted to enrol for ideological reasons. At the same time in 1982 he started working as a stoker (what he did until 1990) and began to engage in the underground movement.

A milestone in his artistic career was his participation in an exhibition in The Youth Gallery in 1985. There started author’s closer co-operation with Petr Veselý and Vladimir Kokolia, which subsequently led to creation of an art group called Tovaryšstvo malířske (Society of Painting). Since the second half of the 1980s Kvíčala’s work was supported by theoreticians Petr Nedoma and Jiří Valoch and he started to be repeatedly invited to participate in exhibitions of professional artists.

In 1986 Kvíčala entered the underground music scene with his band called Květen (May), working on the basis of minimalism and musical and political irony, what are themes which correlate with author’s painterly work of that time. In 1989 he became a member of the art group Měkkohlaví, which was formed in response to the emergence of various artistic groups, lacking a common program, whose main objective was to promote commercially. In 1989 Kvíčala founded, along with Marian Palla and Milan Magni, a musically-performative group called Florián – Group of Haze and Kine.

After 1989 Petr Kvíčala started to be represented in state and public collections and his work was regularly reflected in professional journals. Since 1994 he has been working on the Faculty of Fine Arts in Brno, initially in the studios of conceptual tendencies and intermedia, and later as a head of one of the painting studios (his students were e.g. Jindřich Chalupecký prize laureate Barbora Klímová, Pavel Ryška, Matěj Smetana, Anežka Hošková, Petr Dub, Jana Babincová or Václav Kočí). In 2001 he received a Degree of an Assistant Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague.

In 1995 Kvíčala made his first painterly intervention into architecture (in the apartement of architect Ivan Koleček in Lausanne) and so started a long series of art projects in architecture, which has been one of the main themes of his work until now.

Petr Kvíčala has been dealing with ornament since mid 1980‘s. Both through his work and as a creative artist he confirmed the significance and importance of painting in the era when new media were violently trying to replace other forms of visual art. He works with the simplest ornament, consisting of wavy lines, broken arches or loops. His source of inspiration- landscape – was transformed into an extremely reduced visual vernacular, the basic elements of which are ornamental lines.&lt;ref&gt;Tomáš Pospiszyl: ARTLIST – databáze současného umění, Centrum pro současné umění, {{cite web |url=http://artlist.cz/index.php?id=173 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718170254/http://artlist.cz/index.php?id=173 |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His beginnings were punctuated by attempts to express nature’s principles using the medium of visual art but it the second half of the 1980s the artistic means employed became extremely unorthodox. His creative aspirations from that period were typified by the limitless merging of various disciplines: he created texts inspired by what he had experienced in the landscape and drew simple sketches of fields. At the same time, he was a member of several ensembles dabbing in minimalist music and musique concrète whose productions crossed the boundary between theatrical and performance and animated sculptural installation.&lt;ref&gt;Tomáš Pospiszyl - "Nejen pro oči", Petr Kvíčala, červenec 1984 až 28. 2. 2006, str. 240 - 242&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Petr Kvicala - byt Ivana Kolecka.jpg|thumb|left|Apartment of Ivan Koleček, Lausanne]]
At the turn of 1980’s and 1990’s, Petr Kvíčala’s work seemed to display an affinity with the broad stream of post-modernist Czech painting as hinted at by the clear colours of the paintings, which enclosed colour surfaces within boundaries and used archetypal-geometric elements. Today, such a general classification is less justifiable. Obviously, rather than making post-modernist quotations and providing a symbolic content to the paintings, so characteristic for the painters from the circle of the Tvrdohlaví group, Kvíčala was more interested in probing the possibilities of the painting medium itself. The orderly inner arrangements of Kvíčala’s work is determined by employing lines approached as ornaments. Of these, the undulating line – a rhythmic painterly gesture in time – if featured most often. The lines are combined and composed according to clear pre-determined rules of algorithms which nevertheless may produce unexpected results. Attention was drawn to the similarities between his works and ornamental paintings in folk architecture (the Waves 1991) or to the affinity to the abstract cave paintings.

Kvíčala indicates his inspiration from „low“ culture by using elements from artistic crafts or industrial manufacturing. In the Wallpapers (1987–1988) and Festive Tablecloths for Everyday (1992–1994) cycles he balanced on the hard-to-define line between ornaments on utility objects and artistic expression. He also emphasized manual, and therefore imperfect, reproduction of the ornamental rhythm. However, at the initial level, Kvíčala is not concerned with a post-modern game of aligning various languages, but rather he wishes to rehabilitate ornament as such. He values its visual effectiveness, rational order and its possibility of continuous variation. Kvíčala showed great invention and desire to experiment within his intentionally abridged vocabulary. Among his works we can find procedural paintings, where the surface of the painting can be looked upon as a relic of the time spent on the execution (60&amp;nbsp;Days of Red, Blue and Yellow, 1996, Monochromes).
[[File:Petr Kvicala - prace na Watermelon-Cut Ceiling Dance.JPG|thumb|Work on sketches for ceiling painting „Watermelon-Cut Ceiling Dance“, 2004]]
In Memory cycle (2001–2003) Kvíčala works with a negative definition of lines, delineating them with a surrounding red surface, a memory of lines and fragments of ornaments, their imprint in the mind. Working with broad lines led author to an opposite extreme: using white paint he reduced ornamental lines to the very extreme of technical possibilities of traditional painting (Fine Stripes – Coded Ornaments 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petr-kvicala.com/paintings.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715072500/http://www.petr-kvicala.com/paintings.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent works by Petr Kvíčala implement the artist’s accustomed repertoire of line ornaments, combining waves, broken lines and loops. The special optical effect is achieved by a multiple repetition of thin parallel lines of the two basic ornaments and an intentionally limited colour palette, relying on a simple rhythm of two to three colours. Special prominence is given to minuscule deviations and “flaws” in the applied order. These serve as another, improvised, level of rhythmicizing the paintings although they can also be perceived as a generalization of the natural and human responses to environmental changes (cycles Dogon 2007, Pacific 2008, Flow 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petr-kvicala.com/paintings.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715072500/http://www.petr-kvicala.com/paintings.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}; Tomáš Pospiszyl: texty pro výstavu Vlny / Waves v Wanniek Gallery v Brně, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Installation ==

Since 1993 Petr Kvíčala has created a number of ephemeral installations – mostly on the floors of galleries and in public space. Major installations are e.g. send lines in Plasy convent (1993), the red pigment installation in Behémot gallery in Praque (1994) or contemporary Zig Zag streed art in Brno (2009).

== Architectonic Interventions ==

Since the second half of 1990’s painterly interventions into architecture are one of the main topics of Kvíčala’s work. He uses principles and themes from his paintings, which he strives to transfer to the specific architectural space. Kvíčala is also a coordinator of international educational and research project 2B2A, dealing with cooperation between art and architecture, its theoretical reflection and practical implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Kvíčala, červenec 1984 až 28. 2. 2006. s. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Petr Kvicala - sportovni hala v Litomysli.JPG|thumb|left|Mural for sportshall, Litomyšl, 2001]]
The very first painterly intervention into architecture Kvíčala made, was in the apartment of architect Ivan Koleček in Lausanne. „Southern part of the apartment, with windows facing the lake, contains the living space and the adjoining studies, while the northern part faces the town. I noticed that the southern exterior „pervades“ the house to such an extend that any change in weather and the continual play of light are reflected, by the great mirror of the lake surface, in the living space and becomes ts integral component. As a result, I decided to underline the opposing role of the dividing role relative to the view.“&lt;ref&gt;Petr Kvíčala, červenec 1984 až 28. 2. 2006. s. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Major international project Kvíčala worked on in 2004, was new Deutsche Bundesbank building in Chemnitz (architect Josep Luís Mateo), where he realized the ceiling painting „Watermelon Cut – Ceiling Dance“. The painting on the entrance hall ceiling (exceeding 150&amp;nbsp;m² in area) is both a counterpoint and to the overall logic of the building and its complement. The paint application technique left the brush strokes visible as a sign of a human, yet artificial intervention in stark contrast to the abstraction of the organic construction materials, free of any trace of craftsmanship. Retaining the brushwork proved to be of importance in integrating the work within the architectural space, both as a nod to the process of making the painting and an element evoking the organic nature of the painting – a cut through the living tissue of a solid architectural form.
[[File:Petr Kvicala - Watermelon Cut - Ceiling Dance.JPG|thumb|Ceiling painting " Watermelon Cut - Ceiling Dance", 2004, new building of
Deutsche Bundesbank, Chemnitz]]
In numerous sketches prepared for the painting I first examined the rhythm of the division relative to the format as well as the harmonization of colours with regards to the materials within the space. I continued by producing two cardboard paintings at the actual scale in order to be able to precisely determine the density of the network of lines, the magnitude of the waves and their thickness. While working on the cardboards I concluded that waves of this magnitude cannot be drawn using a standard method, as their dimensions surpass the physical capability of human being. I resorted to attaching the charcoal that I used for drawing on a long pole and, by standing on tip-toe and gyrating the whole body including carefully thought-out legwork, I negotiated smooth curves. I performed something short of a dance during which the body movement is transmitted into the lines drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Kvíčala, červenec 1984 až 28. 2. 2006, s. 213&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Petr Kvicala - Polytechnika EPFL.JPG|thumb|University of Technology EPFL, Lausanne]]
In 2005 Petr Kvíčala cooperated, with architects A. Novák and P. Valenta, on the reconstruction of the historical building of Reduta theatre in Brno. He is author of the mural „40&amp;nbsp;Days of Red“ in Reduta ballroom hall, atrium floor and ceiling arches of the theatre café. The mural consists of layers of red undulating lines laid next to one another. on a red background. In each of the superimposed layer the undulating lines have a different direction. The monochrome effect of the red paint, together with the colour of the parquet flooring arranged into historical patterns conjures up a solemn ambience nurtured by the rare occurrence of the colour red in the nature patterns, and even more so by its endorsement of the culutral and historical tradition. „ The regular layers of repeatedly painted undulating lines impregnates the walls with aspects of time, exertion and sumptuousness. No celebration can take place without show and splendor as, in essence, a „purposeless“ celebration is the most natural human response to the mystery of life.“&lt;ref&gt;Petr Kvíčala, červenec 1984 až 28. 2. 2006, s. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

The motive of Memory cycle was used for wall paintings in Rischart building in Munich (2007). The target to achieve was to create environment which is not only positive but also outstanding and which makes it possible for the employees to identify with. Those paintings are repeated in the areas of central communications: in the corridors of the cloakrooms located in the basement, in the high lit part of the staircase leading from the second to the fifth floor, as well as in the central area in front of the offices of the owners and in the meeting room of the fifth floor, around the staircase leading to the café for the employees on the sixth floor.. „ Restricting the lines by surrounding red areas, the memory of the line and fragments of the ornaments is a sort of an imprint on one's mind. I thought of the ancient concept of Crete in which unlike in the Greek one everything is floating, everything is shown in non-existence and does not manifest its achievement and the drama of the fight. It is a world of gardens determined for solitary confinement, for rest and meditation, for the world I sometimes long for and which I can relate to.“&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.petr-kvicala.com/architecture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715072507/http://www.petr-kvicala.com/architecture.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other ==

Since 1980’s Kvíčala has also created number of painted objects, since 1990’s he has been applying his motives to utility items, especially to textiles (e.g. his cooperation with Denisa Nová, DNB) or China.

'''Raymond St. Jacques''' (March 1, 1930 – August 27, 1990) was an [[United States|American]] actor, director and producer. He was the first African American actor to appear in a regular role on a western series, playing Simon Blake on ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''.

==Early years==
[[File:John Ireland Raymond St.Jacques Rawhide 1965.JPG|thumb|St. Jacques (right) as Simon Blake with [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]], 1965]]
St. Jacques was born '''James Arthur Johnson''' in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. He had a sister, Barbara Ann. Shortly after his birth, his parents divorced; he moved with his mother and sister to [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="flint"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flint|first1=Peter B.|title=Raymond St. Jacques, an Actor Of TV and Films, Is Dead at 60|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/30/obituaries/raymond-st-jacques-an-actor-of-tv-and-films-is-dead-at-60.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=March 25, 2016|date=August 30, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's mother Vivienne later worked as a medical technician at [[Yale University]]. After graduating from [[Hillhouse High School]], Johnson attended Yale, where he studied drama and psychology.&lt;ref name="flint"/&gt; 

Upon graduation, he worked as an assistant director, actor and [[fencing]] instructor for the American Shakespearean Festival in New Haven. He staged all of the fencing scenes and duels while at the company and would continue to practice fencing for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="baltimore"&gt;{{cite news|title=AFRO talks to...Director, Producer, Actor 'Book of Numbers' Raymond St. Jacques|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1715&amp;dat=19730407&amp;id=bbs9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4SsMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1734,26486767&amp;hl=en|work=Baltimore Afro-American|date=April 10, 1973|location=Baltimore, Maryland|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to [[New York City]], Johnson continued to pursue acting and studied at the [[Actors Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=|first=David |last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=278|chapter=Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support himself, he worked as a model, dishwasher and a busboy.&lt;ref name="flint"/&gt; His first professional acting role was in the off-Broadway play ''High Name Today''.&lt;ref name="baltimore"/&gt;

==Career==
After appearing in bit parts on television in the early 1960s, St. Jacques made his film debut in a small part in the 1964 film ''[[Black Like Me (film)|Black Like Me]]''.&lt;ref name="jetobit"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Actor Raymond St. Jacques Succumbs to Cancer At 60|journal=Jet|date=September 17, 1990|volume=78|issue=23|pages=12–14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s68DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=raymond+st.+jacques+forest+lawn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dC2G6zojvM&amp;sig=RtE2TR3ujF6qoyxR4yTem-mfGpE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOxKDRtNvLAhVDwiYKHWg0DkwQ6AEIYzAO#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 25, 2016|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed with a role in ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'' later that year. In 1968, he appeared in a supporting role in ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''. 

His best-known film roles were that of Coffin Ed in the [[blaxploitation]] classics ''[[Cotton Comes to Harlem]]'' (1970) (adapted from crime novels by [[Chester Himes]]) and ''[[Come Back, Charleston Blue]]'' (1972). In the early 1970s, St. Jacques began teaching fencing and acting at the Mafundi Institute in [[Watts, Los Angeles]]. In 1973, he produced, directed, and starred in the crime film ''[[Book of Numbers (film)|Book of Numbers]]''.&lt;ref name="baltimore"/&gt; 

During the 1960s, St. Jacques also guest starred on numerous television shows including ''[[East Side/West Side]]'', ''[[Daktari]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]''. In 1965, he was cast as "Simon Blake" in the Western series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', the first African-American actor to ever be cast as a regular on a prime time Western series. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, St. Jacques continued with roles on stage, film and television. He became known as "The Man of a Thousand Faces" due to the varied parts he played throughout his career.&lt;ref name="jetobit"/&gt;

In 1976, St. Jacques starred as [[Othello (character)|Othello]] in the [[John Anson Ford Amphitheatre]] production of the [[Othello|play of the same name]]. He remained active in stage work throughout his career, touring in productions of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', and the stage adaptation of ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm (novel)|The Man with the Golden Arm]]''.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Raymond St. Jacques; Actor was 60|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-29/news/mn-214_1_actor-raymond-st-jacques|website=latimes.com|accessdate=March 25, 2016|date=August 29, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1988 to 1989, St. Jacques had a two-year stint as Judge Clayton C. Thomas on the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] TV show ''[[Superior Court (TV series)|Superior Court]]''.  In 1989, he played [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Frederick Douglass]] in [[Edward Zwick]]'s ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]''.&lt;ref name="jetobit"/&gt; His final film role was in the 1991 sci fi film ''[[Timebomb (1991 film)|Timebomb]]'' released after his death.

==Personal life==
St. Jacques was a lifelong bachelor.&lt;ref name="jet"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Late Actor St. Jacques Leaves Estate Valued At $750,000 To Kin, Friends|journal=Jet|date=April 15, 1991|volume=79|issue=26|pages=35–36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37sDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=sterling+st.+jacques&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuxfWTqNvLAhXESCYKHXKaD2cQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sterling%20st.%20jacques&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 25, 2016|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1969, St. Jacques granted an interview to columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] and told Wilson of his plans to adopt two African American boys who were 6 and 7 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Earl|title=Bachelor Actor St. Jacques To Adopt 2 Children|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19690802&amp;id=Zs0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IBEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5264,311368&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 25, 2016|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=August 2, 1969|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption apparently never happened but, by the early 1970s, St. Jacques claimed to have two older sons, Raymond St. Jacques, Jr. and [[:it:Sterling Saint Jacques|Sterling St. Jacques]]. In a 1973 interview, St. Jacques claimed that Raymond, Jr. was living in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name="baltimore"/&gt; In May 1972, Sterling, then reported to be 22 years old, made news after four men attempted to rob St. Jacques' [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] home. Sterling was the only person home at the time (St. Jacques was in Dallas at the time) and fled after calling police. The four men were apprehended after their getaway car stalled in St. Jacques' driveway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspects Caught In Stalled Car|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19720526&amp;id=qVwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6wEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3795,6066558&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 25, 2016|work=Toledo Blade|date=May 27, 1972|location=Toledo, Ohio|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling went on to appear in St. Jacques' 1973 film ''[[Book of Numbers (film)|Book of Numbers]]''.&lt;ref name="baltimore"/&gt; In the mid to late 1970s, Sterling St. Jacques became known as a high fashion model (he was briefly engaged to fellow model [[Pat Cleveland]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Fast Paced Ride With the Jet Set Crowd|journal=Ebony|date=August 1977|volume=21|issue=10|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08sDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=sterling+st.+jacques+pat+cleveland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNsNjkr9vLAhWM8CYKHaxuCrIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sterling%20st.%20jacques%20pat%20cleveland&amp;f=false|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0012-9011}}&lt;/ref&gt; dancer and a frequent New York City nightclub and society fixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Walter|authorlink1=Lloyd Shearer|title=Walter Scott's Personality Parade|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19761128&amp;id=McstAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-KAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2296,6893380&amp;hl=en|work=Reading Eagle|date=November 28, 1976|location=Reading, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of Raymond, Jr. and Sterling was apparently never official. In his will, St. Jacques claimed that he had no children and named only Sterling, whom he identified as his nephew, in his will. St. Jacques bequeathed Sterling $1 from his $750,000 estate.&lt;ref name="jet"/&gt;

===Activism===
St. Jacques frequently spoke of the prejudices he and other African American actors faced in being cast in non-stereotypical, thoughtful roles. He later worked to help African Americans find work behind the camera.&lt;ref name="jetobit"/&gt; In 1977 he publicly criticised the lack of minority actors in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (which he acknowledged having seen five times) and other [[science fiction]] films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=St. Jacques|first1=Raymond|title=The Great White Void|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20382247/|work=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=17 July 1977|page=R2|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monagle|first1=Matthew|title=The Fight Over Star Wars and Racism in 1977|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-fight-over-star-wars-and-racism-in-1977-828063c65f65/|website=Film School Rejects|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929153515/https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-fight-over-star-wars-and-racism-in-1977-828063c65f65/|archivedate=29 September 2017|date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Jacques was also an activist for African American civil rights. In 1985, he and other protestors were arrested during an anti-[[apartheid]] demonstration outside of the South African embassy in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Actor Arrested|journal=Jet|date=March 25, 1985|volume=68|issue=2|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=raymond+st.+jacques+apartheid&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d1VlgpcNn3&amp;sig=uLGjnVkqZef4glvJfvrmHIiWTDY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwn6uAu9vLAhUQ8WMKHQheAPAQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=raymond%20st.%20jacques%20apartheid&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 25, 2016|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On August 27, 1990, St. Jacques died from AIDS-related [[lymphoma]] at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jetobit"/&gt; His funeral was held on August 31 at The Church of the Recessional at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in Glendale, California, after which he was interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Funeral Rites Set for Raymond St. Jacques|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-31/news/mn-190_1_raymond-st-jacques|accessdate=March 25, 2016|date=August 31, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''RollerCoaster Tycoon World''''' is a theme park [[construction and management simulation]] [[video game]] developed by Nvizzio Creations and published by [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is the fourth major installment in the [[RollerCoaster Tycoon (series)|''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' series]]. The game was released on November 16, 2016.

==Gameplay==
Players are able to build rides, shops and roller coasters, while monitoring elements such as budget, visitor happiness and technology research. Unlike ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile]]'', the game does not include any [[micro-transactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/473909/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-coming-to-pc-in-2015/|title=Rollercoaster Tycoon World coming to PC in 2015|publisher=CVG|date=12 August 2014|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'', the game features 3D graphics instead of the 2D isometric style of the first two installments in the series. When building roller coasters, the game makes use of a spline system instead of the old style of laying individual pieces. Players are also allowed to "ride" the roller coasters they have created, and other rides they have placed in their park in the game, in either a first or third person view. A new 'Park Pulse' mechanic was also introduced, allowing players to quickly find out how their park is doing and the customers' thoughts, similar to ''[[Zoo Tycoon (2013 video game)|Zoo Tycoon]]'' titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-02-rollercoaster-tycoon-world-in-game-screenshots-revealed|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World in-game screenshots revealed|publisher=Eurogamer|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game contains several scenery and ride themes at launch, with more in development that will be released via free updates and paid expansion packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2607109/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-preview-the-ride-never-ends.html|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World preview: The ride never ends|author=Hayden Dingman|work=[[PC World]]|date=2014-09-13|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog-post-2/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Production Blog Post #2|author=Mattlab|publisher=[[Atari]]|accessdate=2015-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206033833/http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog-post-2/|archivedate=6 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also introduces an "Architect mode", allowing players to plan and layout the coaster's model before constructing the coasters. Similar to the past installments, there are four different types of coasters available to build: [[Steel roller coaster|steel]], [[Inverted roller coaster|inverted]], [[Wooden roller coaster|wooden]], and [[Launch track|launch-track]] coasters. In addition, there are ten roller coasters per type. 
Coasters can be built freeform or the player can place pre-mode designs into their park.&lt;ref name="DevBlog3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog-post-3/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Production Blog Post #3|author=Mattlab|publisher=[[Atari]]|accessdate=2015-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207073646/http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog-post-3/|archivedate=7 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike in the previous games, the roller coaster train may fly off the tracks if the roller coaster is built incorrectly. As a result, a new "safety-rating" option and medical staff has been added. User-generated content (including custom scenery) was available from release, as well as Steam Workshop support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.rollercoastertycoon.com/showthread.php?3960-RollerCoaster-Tycoon-World-Production-Blog-13&amp;p=24179&amp;viewfull=1#post24179|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Production Blog #13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While terrain and environments are randomly generated in a map, players can still gain access to a terrain editor.&lt;ref name="DevBlog1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Production Blog Post #1|author=Mattlab|publisher=[[Atari]]|accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
When Atari announced ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile]]'', they also promised that a title for Windows was also being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/rollercoaster-tycoon-4-mobile-out-now-pc-version-to-be-introduced-holiday-2014/1100-6418966/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile out now, PC version to be introduced holiday 2014|publisher=Gamespot|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was officially announced during [[Gamescom|Gamescom 2014]] with a teaser trailer, subtitled ''World''.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkYDqYcyEU0|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Reveal Trailer|publisher=IGN|date=2014|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first screenshots and details of the game were revealed during [[PAX Prime|PAX Prime 2014]]. Part way through development, Area 52 Games took over as the developer of the game from [[Pipeworks Software]]. The reasoning behind this has not yet been published by Atari, who announced the change along with the relaunch of the RollerCoaster Tycoon website. The game was due for release in early 2015, although it was revealed that they would not announce an official launch date until closer to the release of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/rollercoaster_tycoon_world/news/rollercoaster_tycoon_world_has_a_new_developer.html|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World has a new developer|author= David Scammell|work=VideoGamer.com|date=December 15, 2014|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closed [[Alpha release|alpha]] was also in development.&lt;ref name="DevBlog1"/&gt; A new trailer showing gameplay was uploaded on March 5, 2015, showing an intro featuring real life POV footage of [[Goliath (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Goliath]] and [[Colossus (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Colossus]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]].&lt;ref name=gameplay-trailer&gt;{{cite web|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World™ Gameplay Reveal Teaser|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYNiIzBM7_w|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Atari, Inc.|accessdate=March 5, 2015|date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atari later revealed that a third developer had taken over from Area 52 Games, later confirmed to be Nvizzio Creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/05/13/roller-coaster-tycoon-world-is-still-in-development-but-its-under-a-new-studio/|title=Roller Coaster Tycoon World is still in development — but it’s under a new studio|last=Grub|first=Jeff|date=May 13, 2015|work=[[VentureBeat]]|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[NVIDIA]] booth on [[PAX Prime]] 2015, Atari unveiled interactive gameplay for the game showing off their development build that featured coaster building and sandbox mode. On September 29, 2015, it was announced the release date would be December 10, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2977645/software-games/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-preview-a-wildly-easy-to-get-into-ride.html|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World preview: A wild(ly easy to get into) ride|date=2015-08-30|author=Hayden Dingman|work=[[PC World]]|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sys-con.com/node/3421930|title=Atari® Rides into PAX Prime 2015, Unveils RollerCoaster Tycoon World™|date=2015-08-20|author=Pr Newswire|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two beta weekends  preceded the release of the game. The first beta weekend was the last weekend of October and this beta was focused on the new spline-based Coaster Builder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/buy/|title=Buy - RollerCoaster Tycoon World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first beta weekend took place as planned.  However, feedback from this beta weekend led to Atari deciding to delay the game's release to early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rctw-blog-23-rollercoaster-tycoon-world-releasing-in-early-2016/|title=RCTW – Blog #23 – RollerCoaster Tycoon World Releasing in Early 2016 {{!}} RollerCoaster Tycoon World|website=www.rollercoastertycoon.com|accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The developer noted the additional development time would allow them to add requested items and features such as “predefined piece” coaster building, additional coaster test feedback, a robust fencing tool, improved on-demand grid, and various smaller improvements."  Consequently, the second beta weekend was also delayed from November to December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-delayed-following-first/1100-6432283/ |title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Delayed Following First Beta |last=Pereira |first=Chris |date=2015-11-13 |website=GameSpot |language=en-US |access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[Atari]] had decided that its theme park game, ''RollerCoaster Tycoon World'', would be launched into Early Access on 30 March, instead of going with a full release. The early access release was met with negative reviews, mostly complaining about the poor graphics, coaster builder, lack of detail, and ride animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2016-25-03-rollercoaster-tycoon-world-coming-to-steam-early-access-on-march-30th|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World coming to Steam Early Access on March 30th|last=Falcon|first=Jonah|publisher=GameWatcher|date=March 25, 2016|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Atari announced that the game will be released on November 16, 2016, one day before ''[[Planet Coaster]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Livingston|first1=Christopher|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World release date announced, and it's one day before Planet Coaster's launch|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-release-date-announced-and-its-one-day-before-planet-coasters-launch/|accessdate=11 November 2016|work=pcgamer|date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was available for both standard and deluxe editions. The deluxe edition contained two additional maps, terrain texture additions, a digital art book, a gold park entrance, and the panda mascot from the previous games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World preorders now available at Steam &amp; GMG|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/09/29/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-preorders-now-available-at-steam-gmg/|website=Venture Beat|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World™: Deluxe Edition|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/405580/|website=Steam|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-release ===
A trailer released by Atari containing gameplay of ''RollerCoaster Tycoon World'' was received poorly by critics and fans.&lt;ref name="KotakuTrailerCriticism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/new-rollercoaster-tycoon-game-looks-like-shit-1689731858|title=New ''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' Game Looks Like Shit|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|date=March 5, 2015|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/831009-rollercoaster-tycoon-worlds-gameplay-trailer-tragically-bad|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World’s Gameplay Trailer is Tragically Bad|last=Leack|first=Jonathan|date=March 5, 2015|publisher=Crave Online|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamesided.com/2015/03/05/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-gameplay-trailer-something/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Gameplay Trailer Is...

RollerCoaster Tycoon World looks...|date=2015-03-06|author=Wesley Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atari later issued a statement that the game was still in "pre-alpha" stages, and that the graphics were not yet coded to their full resolution and would also receive a major overhaul when the game's engine is upgraded from Unity 4.6 to Unity 5.0. They also promised that the new visuals would be of higher definition and higher level of realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/21/8270517/rollercoaster-tycoon-promises-graphics-overhaul-after-gameplay|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon promises graphics overhaul after gameplay trailer raises complaints|date=2015-03-21|author=Owen S.

=== Release ===
The release of ''RollerCoaster Tycoon World'' was met with negative reactions by critics. According to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]], the game holds a score of 43 out of 100, based on seven reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaCritic"/&gt;

''[[Eurogamer]]'' suggested to avoid the game, comparing the game to a "car-crash into an orphanage for bush-babies."&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt;

TechRaptor rated the game a 1/10, citing the large interface and variety of bugs and glitches within the game.&lt;ref name="TechRaptor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blouin|first1=Alec|title=Roller Coaster Tycoon World Review – How to Destroy a Franchise|url=https://techraptor.net/content/roller-coaster-tycoon-world-destroy-franchise|website=TechRaptor|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5016">'''SQRRR''' or '''SQ3R''' is a [[reading comprehension]] method named for its five steps: '''survey, question, read, recite, and review'''. The method was introduced by [[Francis P. Robinson]], an American education philosopher in his 1946 book ''Effective Study''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|title = Effective Study
|edition = 6th
|publisher = Harper &amp; Row
|location = New York
|isbn = 978-0-06-045521-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method offers a more efficient and active approach to reading textbook material.{{cn|date=February 2018}} It was created for college students, but is extremely useful for young students as well. Classrooms all over the world have begun using this method to better understand what they are reading.&lt;ref name="gunning"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar methods developed subsequently include [[PQRST (study skill)|PQRST]] and [[KWL table]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.einstein.yu.edu/education/student-affairs/academic-support-counseling/study-methods/reading-course-textbooks.aspx|title=Reading Course Textbooks|publisher=Office of Academic Support &amp; Counseling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
#Survey
#:The first step, survey or [[Speed_reading#Skimming_and_scanning|skim]], advises that one should resist the temptation to read the book and instead first go through a chapter and note headings, sub-headings and other outstanding features, such as figures, tables, and summary paragraphs. This survey step only takes 3–5 minutes, but it provides an outline or framework for what will be presented. The reader should identify ideas and formulate questions about the content of the chapter.
#Question
#:[[Inquiry-based learning|Generate questions]] about the content of the reading. For example, convert headings and sub-headings into questions, and then look for answers in the content of the text. Other more general questions may also be formulated:
#:* ''What is this chapter about?
#:* ''What question is this chapter trying to answer?''
#:* ''How does this information help me?''
#:* The Question step again only takes 3–5 minutes to complete, but it will motivate the reader to seek answers to the questions.
#Read (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)
#:Use the background work done with "S" and "Q" in order to begin reading actively. This means reading in order to answer the questions raised under "Q". Passive reading, in contrast, results in merely reading without engaging with the study material.
#Recite (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
#:The second "R" refers to the part known as "Recite." The reader should try to retrieve from memory what was learned in the same manner as telling someone else about the information. It is important that the reader use his/her own words in order to formulate and conceptualize the material. Try recalling and identifying major points (heading/subheadings) and answers to questions from the "Q" step. This recital step may be done either in an oral or written format and is related to the benefits of retrieval ([[testing effect]]) in boosting long-term memory for the material.
#Review (R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
#:The final "R" is "Review." Once you reach the end of the passage, say back to yourself what the point of the whole passage is – again, using your own words. You may then repeat the process on the second set of questions. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat/new-sat-tips-planning/sat-reading-test-strategies/a/sat-active-reading-strategies-part-1-sq3r&lt;/ref&gt;

== Six stages of effective comprehension ==
Best's process of effective comprehension suggests six stages for better understanding a topic while in a learning process.

*Knowing vs Understanding what the passage says (Fact finding vs Making meaning with [[time management]]).
*Reflecting (Bringing the information to life in your own words to personalize and consolidate).
*Interpersonal understanding (Checking whether the reader understood the topic e.g. Explaining the idea to someone, doing seminars...etc.)
*Intrapersonal understanding (Finding personal significance (interpret, compare &amp; conclude tentatively) of the topic in real world aspects)
*Visualisation (Tony Buzan's [[Mind Map]]ping)
*[[Mindfulness]] and [[Acceptance]]

'''Structured Liberal Education''' ('''SLE''' {{IPAc-en|s|l|i:}}) is a program at [[Stanford University]] offering an alternative three-course sequence for freshmen to fulfill their Thinking Matters and Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) requirements. With a year-long schedule of eight units (formerly eight units in the fall and winter quarters, increasing to nine units in the spring quarter), SLE is unique in its intellectual rigor, multi-disciplinary approach, and residence-based structure.

==History==
Structured Liberal Education was the brainchild of Stanford [[history]] professor Mark Mancall, with political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]] as one of the original proponents of the program's enactment. In some respects, Stanford's SLE is comparable to other notable "[[Great Books]]" programs, such as [[Directed Studies at Yale University|Directed Studies]] at [[Yale University]], the Liberal Arts Seminar at [[Georgetown University]], the Program of Liberal Studies at the [[University of Notre Dame]], the [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] at [[Columbia University]], the Core Curriculum at the [[University of Chicago]], the Foundation Year Programme at the [[University of King's College]], the Arts One Program at the [[University of British Columbia]], the curriculum at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], the Bachelor of Humanities program at [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, and the curriculum at [[Shimer College]] in Chicago, with the distinction that the culturally diverse reading list at SLE reflects Mancall's scholarly interests in East Asia.

==Structure==
All SLE participants live, dine, and attend class in the same residence hall, [[Stanford Florence Moore Hall|Florence Moore]] (FloMo).  As of 2013, they live in one of the three FloMo East houses: the all-freshman dorm, Alondra, which is made up of half SLE students and half non-SLE freshmen, and the two four-class dorms, Cardenal and Faisan.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the upperclassmen in Cardenal and Faisan are former SLE students, which helps maintain an SLE community spanning the different years.  In the main lounge of Florence Moore, known as the SLE lounge, students attend lectures given by professors within many departments at Stanford and by visiting guest lecturers. In addition, students participate in small-group sections, in which they discuss the lectures and assigned literature from SLE's extensive, diverse, and ever-evolving reading list. Films, often relating to the material of study, are screened weekly, and student-produced plays are regularly part of the syllabus. [[Aristophanes]]' "[[Lysistrata]]" is traditionally performed in the fall. SLE also provides freshman with intensive individual writing tutorials.

==Administration==
SLE is now under the auspices of the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages, which provides intellectual and academic support and is the base of many of the faculty who participate in the program.  The administrative home of SLE is in the Residential Programs unit within the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education.

'''United States Artists''' ('''USA''') is an independent nonprofit and nongovernmental [[philanthropic organization]] based in Chicago and dedicated to supporting the work of living American artists by the granting of cash awards, called [[List of United States Artists (USA) Fellowship recipients|USA Fellowships]].&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, "[http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2006/09/25/art_for_our_sake/ Art for our sake]," ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', September 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2005 with initial funding from the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], The [[Prudential Foundation]], and the Rasmuson Foundation, and the first set of 50 fellowships were announced in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Cole, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aV4ZXOmY4AXM "Seminole Filmmaker, Guitarist Awarded $50,000 Grants" (Update1)], [[Bloomberg.com]], December 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is governed by a Board of Directors and receives additional funding from several major American foundations, corporate partners, and private citizens.

== Mission ==

The organization's stated mission is "to invest in America's finest artists and illuminate the value of artists to society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/about/|title=United States Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the organization asserts that "[[List of United States Artists (USA) Fellowship recipients|USA Fellowships]] honor and award an artist’s unique vision as a whole rather than funding a particular project. Artists at different career levels, from emerging to established, are eligible."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/connect#faq|title=United States Artists  » Connect|website=www.unitedstatesartists.org|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selection process ==

Prerequisites for consideration include that the artist be 21 or older, a [[US citizen]] or [[legal resident]]. In addition, nominees must be accomplished artists, must have acquired art training, formal or informal, must have tried to derive income from those skills, and must have been "actively engaged in creating artwork and presenting it to the public." To be considered for a grant, an artist must first be nominated by at least one of a group of "nominators" chosen by the organization. This is an anonymous group of arts scholars, critics, and artists from various disciplines; they operate independently of one another. The nominators submit names of artists they believe should be considered for an award.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Once nominated artists have been notified of their nomination, they are then directed to apply for the grant in order to be considered. The awards are announced once a year. The Fellows announcement is made in December of each year.

==Grants==

Grants are awarded annually to artists working in nine disciplines:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6789">The '''Imperial University of [[Constantinople]]''', sometimes known as the '''University of the Palace Hall of Magnaura''' ({{lang-el|Πανδιδακτήριον τῆς Μαγναύρας}}), can trace its corporate origins to 425 AD, when the [[Eastern Roman Empire | Eastern Roman]] ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) emperor [[Theodosius II]] founded the '''Pandidakterion''' (Πανδιδακτήριον).&lt;ref&gt;
"The Formation of the Hellenic Christian Mind" by [[Demetrios Constantelos]], {{ISBN|0-89241-588-6}}: "The fifth century marked a definite turning point in Byzantine higher education. Theodosios ΙΙ founded in 425 a major university with 31 chairs for law, philosophy, medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, rhetoric and other subjects. Fifteen chairs were assigned to Latin and 16 to Greek. The university was reorganized by Michael III (842–867) and flourished down to the fourteenth century".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pandidakterion was refounded in 1046&lt;ref&gt;John H. Rosser, ''Historical Dictionary of Byzantium'', Scarecrow Press, 2001, p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] who created the Departments of [[Law]] (Διδασκαλεῖον τῶν Νόμων) and [[Philosophy]] (Γυμνάσιον).&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Petrovich Kazhdan, Annabel Jane Wharton, ''Change in Byzantine Culture in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries'', University of California Press, 1985, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time various economic schools, colleges, polytechnics, libraries and fine-arts academies also operated in the city of Constantinople.

== History ==
Byzantine society on the whole was an educated one. Primary education was widely available, sometimes even at village level and uniquely in that era for both sexes. Female participation in culture was high. Scholarship was fostered not only in Constantinople but also in institutions operated in such major cities as [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rietbergen, ''Europe: A Cultural History'', Routledge, 1998, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original school was founded in 425 by Emperor [[Theodosius II]] with 31 chairs for [[law]], [[philosophy]], [[medicine]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astronomy]], [[music]], [[rhetoric]] and other subjects, 15 to [[Latin]] and 16 to [[Greek language|Greek]]. The university existed until the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myriobiblos.gr/texts/english/Constantelos_1.html Myriobiblos]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main content of higher education for most students was rhetoric, philosophy and law with the aim of producing competent, learned personnel to staff the bureaucratic postings of state and church. In this sense the university was the secular equivalent of the Theological Schools. The university maintained an active philosophical tradition of [[Platonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]], with the former being the longest unbroken Platonic school, running for close to two millennia until the 15th century. 

The School of [[Magnaura]] was founded in the 9th century but did not last very long,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Markopoulos | first = Athanasios | editor-last = Jeffreys | editor-first = Elizabeth | editor2-last = Haldon | editor2-first = John F. | editor3-last = Cormack | editor3-first = Robin | year = 2008 | title = The Oxford handbook of Byzantine studies | chapter = Education | series = Oxford Handbooks in Classics and Ancient History | publisher = Oxford University Press | publication-place = Oxford | pages = 785–795 | isbn = 978-0-19-925246-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 11th new schools of philosophy and law were established at the Capitol School. The period of decline began with the [[Fourth Crusade|Latin conquest]] of 1204 although the university survived as a non-secular institution under Church management until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, and was re-established by [[Mehmet II]] as a Madrasa (an Islamic theological school) following the conquest of the city.

[[Matthaios Kamariotis]], lecturer of the University, became the first director of [[Phanar Greek Orthodox College]], which was established in 1454.

== Status ==
A few scholars have gone so far as calling the Pandidakterion the first "[[university]]" in the world, but this view does not take into account that the Byzantine [[Ancient higher-learning institutions|centers of higher learning]] generally lacked the corporative structure of the [[Medieval university|medieval universities]] of Western Europe which were the first to use the [[Latin]] term ''universitas'' for the [[corporation]]s of students and masters that came to define the institutional character of the university thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Browning (Byzantinist)|Robert Browning]]: "Universities, Byzantine", in: ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', Vol. 12, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;300–302 (300): {{quote|Universities, Byzantine. The medieval Greek world knew no autonomous and continuing [[Institution of higher education|institutions of higher education]] comparable to the [[Medieval university|universities]] of the later [[Middle Ages]] in [[Western Europe]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loukaki 1997, 1553"&gt;Marina Loukaki: "Université. Domaine byzantin", in: ''[[Dictionnaire encyclopédique du Moyen Âge]]'', Vol. 2, Éditions du Cerf, Paris, 1997, {{ISBN|2-204-05866-1}}, p.&amp;nbsp;1553: {{quote|Le nom "université" désigne au Moyen Âge occidental une organisation corporative des élèves et des maîtres, avec ses fonctions et privilèges, qui cultive un ensemble d'études supérieures. L'existence d'une telle institution est fort contestée pour Byzance. Seule l'école de Constantinople sous Théodose Il peut être prise pour une institution universitaire. Par la loi de 425, l'empereur a établi l'"université de Constantinople", avec 31 professeurs rémunérés par l'État qui jouissaient du monopole des cours publics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the ''Dictionnaire encyclopédique du Moyen Âge'' tentatively identifies the Pandidakterion of 425 AD as a "university institution".&lt;ref name="Loukaki 1997, 1553"/&gt;
