The '''12th man''' or 12th player is a term for [[Fan (person)|fans]] of teams in eleven-a-side sports games, particularly [[association football]] (soccer) or [[American football]]. As most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team on the playing field at a time, referring to a team's fans as the 12th man implies that they have a potentially helpful role in the game. Infrequently, the term has referred to individuals having a notable connection to their football team. In [[Canadian football]], 12 players are usually on the field at one time and the term '''13th man''' is often used to refer to fans. Similarly, in [[Australian rules football]], 18 players are on the field and the fans are often referred to as the '''19th man'''. The term has a different meaning in [[cricket]], referring instead to the [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|first substitute player]] who fields when a member of the fielding side is injured (the term '''6th man''' has a similar connotation in [[basketball]]).

The presence of fans can have a profound impact on how the teams perform, an element in the [[home advantage]]. Namely, the home team fans would like to see their team win the game. Thus these fans will often create loud sounds or [[football chant|chant]] in hopes of distracting, demoralizing and confusing the opposing team while they have possession of the ball; or to persuade a referee to make a favorable decision. Noises are made by shouting, whistling, stomping and various other techniques.

==History==
[[File:E king hill 12thman.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Texas A&amp;M's E. King Gill during the 1921–1922 season]]

The first recorded use of the term "twelfth man" was a magazine published by the [[University of Minnesota]] in September, 1900, that referred to "the mysterious influence of the twelfth man on the team, the rooter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Editorial |journal=Minnesota Magazine |volume=7 |issue=September 1900 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b4NAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 |publisher= University of Minnesota |author=Unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the November 1912 edition of The Iowa Alumnus, an alumni publication of the [[University of Iowa]] (then known as State University of Iowa), E.A. McGowan described the 1903 game between [[1903 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] and the [[1903 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|University of Illinois]]. In his article, titled "The Twelfth Player" McGowan wrote: "The eleven men had done their best; but the twelfth man on the team (the loyal spirited Iowa rooter) had won the game for old S.U.I."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Twelfth Player |journal=The Iowa Alumnus |volume=10 |issue=November 1912 |page=30 |url=http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/uap/id/5706/rec/10 |publisher= University of Iowa. Alumni Association |author=E. A. McGowan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1922 Dixie Classic]] served as the setting for an event later referred to as "The story of the 12th Man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sports and Understanding Organizations|editor=Daniel J. Svyantek|publisher=Information Age Publishing|location=Charlotte, North Carolina|year=2017|page=44|isbn=978-1681237923}}&lt;/ref&gt; This football game featured the top-ranked [[1921 Centre Praying Colonels football team|Centre College]] and [[1921 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team|The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas]] (later known as Texas A&amp;M). During the game, A&amp;M coach [[Dana X. Bible]] realized that one more injury would leave him without another backfield player to send into the game. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ESPN College Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Game|editor=Michael MacCambridge|publisher=ESPN Books|location=New York, NY|year=2005|page=44|isbn=978-1401337032}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Bible called E. King Gill, a sophomore basketball player, down from the stands to stand ready as a substitute. Gill was ready in uniform on the sidelines if his team ever needed him. Gill never went in the game, but his spirit that lives on in the "12th Man." 

Individuals have occasionally been labeled by local media as the "Twelfth Man" of their team. In 1930, W. H. Adamson, Principal of Oak Cliff (Dallas) High School was called the "Twelfth Man" of the school's American football team by a local reporter due to the rousing pre-game speeches he would give to the players.

In the 1935 [[1935 Princeton Tigers football team|Princeton]]-{{cfb link|year=1935|team=Dartmouth Big Green|school=Dartmouth College|title=Dartmouth}} game before 56,000 fans who braved the snow and cold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=December 23, 1935|title=Oddities in 1935 Sports|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19351223&amp;id=rbIhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dZsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3344,5154533}}&lt;/ref&gt; spectator Mike Mesco was initially reported to have left his seat from the stands to join the Dartmouth defensive line and was referred to in a local newspaper as the "Twelfth Dartmouth Man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=none|newspaper=World Telegram|date=November 30, 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it turned out it was not Mesko but George Larsen of Cranford, N.J., who dashed from the stands to aid Dartmouth in her game with Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yale's Error! Fetes Wrong Butt-In Hero|last=Alexander|first=Jack|newspaper=Sunday News|date=December 1, 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asa Bushnell III, Princeton class of 1947, wrote of the incident in 1960 for the Princeton Athletic News: "Strange as it may seem, it was a young architect from Cranford, N.J., a refugee{{clarify|date=January 2017}} from the University of Cincinnati, no less - who immortalized the activities in Palmer Stadium on November 23, 1935. It was he who, midway through the fourth period that tingling afternoon, left the other 55,999 spectators in their seats to assist the Dartmouth Indians in a determined goal-line stand. It was he who lined up with the Hanoverians on the two yard stripe and prevented Jack White from scoring - and White boasted interference from the awesome likes of Johnny Weller and Homer Spofford. It was the daring "twelfth man" who, though escorted unceremoniously off the field and out of the stadium without further ado, gained a nationwide American football reputation in a single play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2001|title=Rites of Autumn, The Story of College Football|last=Whittingham|first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 18, 1938, ''Dallas Morning News'' said "Whether they play now on a team, used to play back in the day, follow the game closely or just quarterback from the grandstand occasionally, every American football enthusiast well knows how much that twelfth man in the stands means to any American football team. But that backing means unusually much in the traditional Thanksgiving game between the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M. With an uncertain monotony that has long since made game forecasters exceedingly skittish, these two win where their twelfth men help most." Thus, in this single instance, the term "Twelfth Man" was used to refer to the fans of both schools playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Twelfth Men |newspaper=Dallas Morning News |date=December 18, 1938 |issue=195 |url=http://www.hornsports.com/docs/aggy/DMN_Dec_18_1938.pdf |publisher= Dallas Morning News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in association football==
[[File:DC12thmanontour.JPG|thumb|[[Derry City FC|Derry City's]] twelfth man in [[Paris]], France.]]

The term "12th man" is commonly used in football to refer to [[Association football culture#Fans|the fans]] and occasionally the manager. A notable club famous for the twelfth man reference comes from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], referring to the Holte End stand at Villa Park. Large European and Asian teams such as [[Bayern Munich]], [[Foolad F.C.|Foolad]], [[Malmö FF]], [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF]], [[Werder Bremen]], [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], [[Feyenoord]], [[Ferencvárosi TC]], [[Red Star Belgrade|FC Red Star]], [[Fenerbahçe S.K.]], and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]] have officially retired the number 12 to the fans. [[Stockport County fans]] are registered as official members of their squad with the number 12.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[Portsmouth F.C.]] has also retired its number 12 shirt, and lists the club's supporters, "Pompey Fans", as player number 12 on the squad list printed in home match programmes,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} while [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] have theirs registered to the ''Green Army'' (the nickname for their fans).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Number 12 is also reserved for the fans at many other clubs, including [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] and [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]] in Russia, [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in England, as well as [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening]] (AGF), [[Odense Boldklub]], also known as [[Odense Boldklub|OB]], in Denmark, [[Malmö FF]] and [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF]] in Sweden and [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]] in Australia. On [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF's]], [[Feyenoord]] and [[Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen's]] home games, the stadium speaker announces number 12 as "the fans" during team lineup announcements.

[[Dynamo Dresden]] in Germany also keeps number 12 for their fans, as well as the official team anthem being "We are the 12th man". [[Aberdeen F.C.]] supporters commonly display a large banner in the shape of a football shirt with the text "Red Army 12" in place of a player's name and number.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The fans of the [[Northern Ireland national football team]] and [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] are referred to as the 12th man as well. In the [[League of Ireland]] [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.]] retired the number 12 jersey in recognition of the fans who took over the club in 2005. [[Cork City Football Club|Cork City F.C.]], [[Clube Atlético Mineiro]] and [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo]] also retired the number 12 for the fans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The most vociferous fans of [[Boca Juniors]] in Argentina are known as the "Jugador Numero 12" (Spanish for "Player Number 12") or simply "La Doce" ("The 12"). On September 18, 2004, [[U.S. Lecce]], an Italian team currently playing in [[Serie A]], retired the number 12 to the fans, which was handed to them by the former captain [[Cristian Daniel Ledesma|Cristian Ledesma]]. They symbolically represent a 12th Man in the field.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In the beginning of 2009/2010 season, [[Happy Valley AA]] introduced the club's mascot, a panda, on squad list as the fan club captain wearing the number 12 jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HVAA Player Profile | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2005/03/02/sport_delia_smith_interview_20050302_feature.shtml | accessdate =October 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of the 2011/2012 season [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers F.C]] announced that the number 12 jersey would be retired in honour of the fans support throughout a period of financial difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rangers.co.uk/news/football-news/article/2757323 |publisher=rangers.co.uk |title=Rangers Dedicate No 12 Jersey to Fans |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607133516/http://www.rangers.co.uk/news/football-news/article/2757323 |archivedate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in American football==

Football coach [[Jackie Sherrill]] created the "12th Man Kick-Off Team" in the 1980s, composed of non-athletic scholarship students who tried out for the team. Coach Sherrill has written a book entitled "No Experience Required" which details this team and the tradition. These students were placed on the roster for the sole purpose of kickoffs. The squad was nicknamed "the suicide squad". These students often had little regard for their safety and were determined to make a tackle at any cost. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Durham|first1=Timothy|title=12th Man honors Sherrill|url=http://www.thebatt.com/2.8484/12th-man-honors-sherrill-1.1185209|website=The Battalion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111230623/http://www.thebatt.com/2.8484/12th-man-honors-sherrill-1.1185209#.Ug3hNX3LfK4|archivedate=January 11, 2012|date=September 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBCref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Evening News |publisher=Vanderbilt Television News Archive |url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=532988 |date=September 2, 1983 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h5lmsYJM?url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=532988 |archivedate=May 27, 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 22, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th Man Kick-Off Team was extremely successful and eventually held opponents to one of the lowest yards-per-return average in the league during kickoffs.{{when|date=October 2014}}&lt;ref name="12thMan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/12thman.shtml |title=Twelfth Man |accessdate=December 31, 2006 |publisher=Aggie Traditions |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229030439/http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/12thman.shtml |archivedate=December 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, head coach [[R.

==Other usage==
In American football, the sideline is sometimes also referred to as the "12th man" or "12th defender": since a player is considered down when he steps out of bounds, the sideline effectively acts as an extra defender. This usage is less common than the one referring to the fans. The term can also be construed to mean the [[referee (association football)|referee]], implying that the match official favours one team and is not impartial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38576689 |title=Bacary Sagna: Man City defender charged by FA for Instagram post |date=2017-01-10 |website=[[BBC Sport]]|quote=The Football Association allege that the defender's post, which was later deleted, "questioned the integrity of the match official".|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The effects of the "12th man" vary widely, but can be put in two categories. The first is simply psychological, the effect of showing the home team that they are appreciated, and showing the away team that they are somewhat unwelcome. The second directly relates to the deafening effects of a loud crowd.

In association football, the crowd is very passionate and often sing throughout the whole match. Some occasions where the crowd noise is extra loud can be before kickoff; during the buildup to and scoring of a [[Goal (sport)|goal]]; when encouraging the team to come back from defeat; to discourage an opposition penalty taker; or to harass a [[Referee (association football)|referee]] giving a free kick to the opposition team.

In American football, fans are most incited by physical play, especially good plays made by the defense.&lt;ref name="boling"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Boling |first=Dave |title=Artificial noise? Much ado about Hawks' 12th Man |url=http://dwb.thenewstribune.com/sports/seahawks/story/6109599p-5353332c.html |newspaper=The News Tribune |location=Tacoma, Washington |date=September 21, 2006 |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |postscript= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117052537/http://dwb.thenewstribune.com/sports/seahawks/story/6109599p-5353332c.html |archivedate=November 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the home team can derive energy from the loud noise of their fans; former American football players have described the feeling of their adrenaline pumping after hearing the fans yell, which is "like you have a reserve energy tank."&lt;ref name=baldinger/&gt;

The noise of the crowd can have a significant impact on the players on the field. In American football, an extremely loud crowd can prevent the [[offensive linemen]] from hearing the [[snap count]]. This can have the effect of making the player slower to react when the ball is snapped, and his eventual response may be weaker than normal because each play is begun "with some indecision and doubt".&lt;ref name=baldinger&gt;{{Cite news |last=Baldinger |first=Brian |title=Gaps in action can kill home-field edge |newspaper=The Sporting News |date=January 12, 2004 |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11863789/gaps-action-can-kill-home-field-edge }}&lt;/ref&gt; The noise can also prevent players from hearing [[American football|audibles]] and can make it difficult for the team's offense to coordinate plays in the huddle. The effect of the noise can often be measured in mistakes, such as [[false start]] penalties.&lt;ref name=acee&gt;{{Cite news|last=Acee |first=Kevin |title=They're right on Q |newspaper=[[The San Diego Tribune]] |date=December 26, 2006 |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061226/news_1s26chargers.html |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227164227/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061226/news_1s26chargers.html |archivedate=December 27, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coaches can take steps to minimize the effect of the crowd noise on their teams. Some American football teams bring large speakers to their practice fields and broadcast loud noises such as jet engines to prepare their teams for the anticipated noise level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Panthers thrive in hostile environments|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2006/01/21/pro_47980.shtml|accessdate=2 June 2014|work=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|date=21 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowd noise tends to diminish after a long lull in play, such as a pause for [[instant replay]]. Former [[National Football League|NFL]] player [[Brian Baldinger]] speculates that some coaches draw out reviews as part of a coaching strategy to quiet the crowd for their next play.&lt;ref name=baldinger/&gt;

A researcher from [[Harvard University]] discovered in a study that some football referees appeared to be impacted by crowd noise. His studies revealed that a home team acquired an additional 0.1&amp;nbsp;goal advantage for every 10,000&amp;nbsp;fans in the stadium.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Study reveals referees' home bias|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/6629397.stm|date=May 6, 2007|accessdate=September 11, 2007|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Where are you?" she cried. [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] lost the game in the final seconds, but Smith's passion worked to increase the affection the fans held for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Delia Smith BBC interview | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2005/03/02/sport_delia_smith_interview_20050302_feature.shtml | accessdate=May 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four additional Trademark claims related to the "12th Man" term were also filed and granted at later dates by Texas A&amp;M University (See U.S. Ser. Nos. {{US trademark|74560726|74560726}}, {{US trademark|76671314|76671314}}, {{US trademark|85977835|85977835}} and {{US trademark|85851199|85851199}}), the first three of which have achieved [[Trademark|Incontestable Status]]{{technical statement|reason=term not in linked article|date=February 2016}} as a result of its section 15 affidavit with the Patent and Trademark Office. According to former Texas A&amp;M Athletic Director Bill Byrne, he contacted the Chicago Bears and Buffalo Bills about halting their "12th Man" themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seahawks' "12th Man" angers A&amp;M|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&amp;id=2309646|website=ESPN.com|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=2 June 2014|date=28 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrne stated that, "they responded quickly with our requests to stop using our Twelfth Man trademark."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moghe|first1=Sonia|title=Trademarking your territory|url=http://www.thebatt.com/2.8485/trademarking-your-territory-1.1196013#.Ux8nc_lkTzg|archiveurl=http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/2006-01-27_thebatt_12th_man.pdf|archivedate=27 January 2006|date=27 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas A&amp;M sent requests to stop using the phrase to the Seattle Seahawks in both 2004 and 2005. The Seahawks did not respond to the requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/seahawks/2006-01-30-12th-man-order_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Texas A&amp;M seeks restraining order over '12th man' | date=January 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, Texas A&amp;M filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. Neither side admitted any fault or liability. In the agreement, the Seahawks licensed the phrase in exchange for $100,000, along with public acknowledgement as to Texas A&amp;M's ownership rights of the phrase, and an additional annual fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='12th Man' for everyone: Seattle, A&amp;M resolve dispute|publisher=ESPN|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2437992|date=May 8, 2006|accessdate=July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compensation amounted to $5,000 per year.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last=Jessop|first=Alicia|title=Texas A&amp;M Stands To Earn More In Upcoming 12th Man Trademark Licensing Negotiations As Seahawks' Exposure Rises|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciajessop/2014/01/31/texas-am-stands-to-earn-more-in-upcoming-12th-man-trademark-licensing-negotiations-as-seahawks-exposure-rises/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=February 17, 2014|date=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodbullhunting.com/2014/1/19/5271954/12th-man-trademark-licensing-agreement-texas-am-aggies-seattle-seahawks|title="12th Man" - Inside Texas A&amp;M's License Agreement with the Seattle Seahawks|author=Brandon Hamburg|date=January 19, 2014|work=Good Bull Hunting}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement, which expired in 2016, limited the Seahawks' usage to seven western states and forbid them from selling any "12th Man" merchandise.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt; In August 2015, the Seahawks shifted towards calling their fans the "12s", and replaced their "Home of the 12th Man" stadium sign with a new "Home of the 12s" sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daniels |first=Chris |title=CenturyLink Field no longer 'Home of the 12th Man' |url=http://www.king5.com/story/sports/nfl/seahawks/2015/08/14/12th-man-seahawks-texasam/31753553/ |publisher=[[KING-TV|KING 5 News]] |date=August 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2015, Texas A&amp;M filed suit against the Indianapolis Colts after repeated cease and desist requests were ignored by the NFL club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rovell|first=Darren |title=Texas A&amp;M says Colts ignoring calls to stop use of '12th Man' |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/14113722/texas-aggies-sue-indianapolis-colts-use-12th-man-trademark |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=November 12, 2015 |accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 17, 2016, the lawsuit was settled with the Colts agreeing to remove the phrase from their Ring of Honor and to immediately cease all other uses of the trademarked phrase.&lt;ref name="indystar.com"/&gt;

In August 2016, the Seahawks agreed to a new five year trademark licensing agreement with Texas A&amp;M. As part of the agreement, the Seahawks agreed to pay Texas A&amp;M $140,000 for limited rights to use the trademarked term. This agreement, like the previous agreement, prohibits the Seahawks from using the "12th Man" term on any merchandise. The new agreement, however, also prohibits Seattle from using the term on social media, nor are they allowed to use the term on any signage within their stadium, including their Ring of Honor.&lt;ref name="espn.com"/&gt;

The '''All-American Strongman Challenge''' is a leading competition in [[strength athletics]] that takes place within the annual Californian FitExpo. Although [[North America]] has a number of prestigious strongman events determining the "Strongest Man in America", the "Strongest Man in Canada" and the "Strongest Man in North America", the All-American Strongman Challenge has added kudos because it is open to entrants from overseas with the potential to bring in leading international competitors as well. It is notable for the calibre of entrants it has attracted, with many [[World's Strongest Man]] finalists being represented.

'''Buckaroo!''' is a [[game of skill|game of physical skill]], intended for players aged four and above.  Buckaroo! is made by [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]], a division of the toy company [[Hasbro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasbro.com/en-gb/product/buckaroo-game:92774685-6D40-1014-8BF0-9EFBF894F9D4 Hasbro Buckaroo page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The game centers on an articulated plastic model of a [[mule]] named "Roo" (or "Buckaroo"). The mule begins the game standing on all four feet, with a blanket on its back.  Players take turns placing various items onto the mule's back without causing the mule to buck up on its front legs, throwing off all the accumulated items (the toy has a spring mechanism that is triggered by significant vibration).  The player who triggered this buck is knocked out of the game, and play resumes.  The winner is the last player remaining in the game. In the (unlikely) event that a player manages to place the last item onto the mule's back without it bucking, that player is the winner.

The toy has three sensitivity levels that are adjustable via a switch located on the side of the mule's body, under the blanket. The switch adjusts the location of the lever to which the blanket is attached in relation to the trigger mechanism attached to the spring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/buckaroo.pdf Rules for playing Buckaroo!]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Items ===
The items which players must place on the mule's back are (variations in names from 2007 UK version in parentheses):
{{colbegin}}
* a [[bedroll]]
* a [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]] (water bottle)
* a [[cowboy hat]]
* a [[crate]] ([[rifle]] box)
* a [[frying pan]]
* a [[guitar]]
* a [[holster]] (holster with [[gun]])
* a [[lantern]] (lamp)
* a [[rope]]
* a [[saddle]]
* a [[shovel]]
* a stick of [[dynamite]]
{{colend}}

Of these, the saddle must be placed first.  It has a number of articulation points on which the subsequent items are hung.  These other items may be placed in any order.

== History ==
It was originally released in 1970 by [[Ideal Toy Company]] using a white mule, this has now been replaced with a brown one.

===Criticism===
In 2006, Buckaroo! was considered dangerous, due to the objects getting flung off the mule when the spring is triggered. On ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and [[CTV News]], it was mentioned that an object had hit a child in the eye, in [[North Carolina]], causing the 8-year-old boy to have surgery. The game was discontinued until 2008 when the instructions were adjusted.

==In popular culture==
* Buckaroo! is a favorite game of [[Father Dougal McGuire]] in [[Ireland|Irish]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Father Ted]]''. He regularly plays the game with [[Father Ted Crilly|Ted]], despite the fact that Ted hates it and would rather play [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeLKp2gxsM|title=Tentacles Of Doom, Father Ted, Season 2 Episode 3|pages=334 seconds in|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">A '''charity runner''' is a participant in a [[Road running|road race]], usually of [[half marathon]] or [[marathon]] distance, who raise money or awareness for an established [[501(c) organization]]. For more elite marathons, such as the [[World Marathon Majors]], runners who are unable to obtain a qualifying time for their gender and age group can gain entry by running for an official charity affiliated with the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bingham |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HckDAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq |title=Faith, Hope and Charities |work=[[Runner's World]] |publisher=Rodale, Inc |date=November 2008 |page=56 |accessdate=2016-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other races provide charity runners with free race entry, training, team shirts, and encouragement as incentive to raise money for local charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.volunteermatch.org/search/opp1641263.jsp |title=Be a Charity Runner in the Pittsburgh Marathon |publisher=VolunteerMatch |accessdate=2016-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Boston Marathon]] allows approximately 6000 runners, out of 30,000 into the annual race who have not qualified. Most of these runners have agreed to raise a minimum of $5000 and greater to gain entry into this race.&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Alison |url=http://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/tension-between-bostons-charity-runners-and-qualifiers-disappears-by-race-day |title=Tension Between Boston’s Charity Runners and Qualifiers Disappears by Race Day |work=[[Runner's World]] |date=2016-04-15 |accessdate=2016-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the charity runners raised $34.2 million for over 200 different non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://running.competitor.com/2017/06/news/2017-boston-marathon-charity-runners-raised-34-2-million_165773|title=2017 Boston Marathon Charity Runners Raised $34.2 Million|date=2017-06-29|work=Competitor.com|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations between qualified runner and charity runners==
According to Runner's World magazine, there is often animosity between qualified runners, who have met strict timing guidelines, and charity runners who do not meet the qualifying time, but are given a number for raising money for local charitable organizations and nonprofits. Some runners who meet the published qualifying time do not get into some major marathons due to the sheer volume of entries.&lt;ref name="Wade" /&gt;

'''Choi Sung-Kuk'''  (born 8 February 1983) is a former [[South Korea]]n footballer who played the [[Forward (association football)|forward]] position.

He was part of the [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic]] football team, who finished second in Group A, making it through to the next round, before being defeated by silver medal winners [[Paraguay]]. He was also capped for South Korean U-20 team at [[2003 FIFA World Youth Championship]].

A member of Korea's squad for the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]], he scored a goal in the opening match against Saudi Arabia.

==Club career==

===Ulsan===
Choi joined [[Ulsan Hyundai]], the [[K-League]] giant in 2003. Ulsan placed second in the league that season. In 2005, he was loaned out to [[J1 League]] side [[Kashiwa Reysol]], but after a 5-month disappointing spell, he returned to Ulsan. Following his return, Ulsan won the league that year. Choi also became the top scorer for the [[Hauzen Cup]], which is the Korean League Cup. It seemed definite that Choi would become Ulsan's icon, but he moved to [[Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma]], which made many Ulsan supporters extremely angry at the board.

===Seongnam===
Choi helped Seongnam become the runner-up that season. However, after his disappointing 2008 season Choi announced he would join the army in 2009, which angered many Seongnam fans. He moved to [[Gwangju Sangmu FC|Gwangju Sangmu]], the army team at the beginning of the 2009 season. There, his partnership with [[Kim Myung-Joong]] was  the core of Gwangju's surprising performance.

In late 2010, he returned to Seongnam and participated in the [[2010 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He scored in the quarterfinal against [[United Arab Emirates]] side [[Al Wahda S.C.C.|Al-Wahda]].

===Suwon===
Choi moved to [[Suwon Samsung Bluewings]] prior to the 2011 season.

;[[2011 South Korean football betting scandal|Match-fixing scandal in June 2011]]
Choi was implicated in a match-fixing scandal while playing for the military team, Sangmu. He denied his involvement when media reports raised the allegations about throwing matches, but soon admitted it as the scandal deepened. Consequently, he was tentatively dropped from his team.

It was officially announced in August 2011 that he would not be able to play in the [[Korea Republic football league system|all league systems in South Korea]] permanently.

===Rabotnički===
On 16 January 2012, it was announced that Choi would join [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] side [[FK Rabotnički]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macedonianfootball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4125:choi-sung-kuk-arrived-at-rabotnicki&amp;catid=1:domestic&amp;Itemid=63 Choi Sung-Kuk arrived at Rabotnicki] at MacedonianFootball.com, 16 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be his first club in Europe of his career. However, his move fell through after the [[Football Federation of Macedonia]] rejected the player's registration after K-League revealed Choi had been banned from playing professional football in any league by FIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifa bans South Korea's Choi Sung-Kuk in wake of match-fixing scandal|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2557/news/2012/03/16/2970590/fifa-bans-south-koreas-choi-sung-kuk-in-wake-of-match-fixing|publisher=Goal.com|date=16 March 2012|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 16 March 2012, Choi Sung-Kuk future football career is in doubt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">'''Dual Box''' or '''DualBox''' is the trademark name for the patented tubular sidewall [[inline skate|inline skating frame]], which employs the mechanical properties of the tubular to optimize the performance of a frame or chassis that secures the wheels on an inline skate (a critical component of high performance skates).

Designed in 1999 by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Design Engineer [[Diederik Hol]] at [[Mogema]], the Dual Box design was devised to optimize the elastic properties of inline skate frames (which the skater interprets as stiffness and feel, and contribute greatly to ride quality and power transmission) via the properties of the tubular sidewalls to enhance rigidity.

The Dual Box design successfully eliminates the need for horizontal cross-bracing in inline skate frames, and provided progressive flexural feel for the skater rather than the isolated areas of varying stiffness which were inherent to many, more traditional double-void [[extrusion]] frames.  

Through a product partnership with the Mogema company, the [[Rollerblade]] professional racing team debuted the Dual Box frame to the world in 2001 after which time team athletes rode Dual Box frames across the finish line first in numerous Swiss Inline Cup, [[World Inline Cup]] and World Championship events.  During this time the Dual Box became one of the most recognized and successful frame designs in [[Inline speed skating|speed skating]], with 45 athletes winning their Gold, Silver and Bronze medals at the 2001 World Speed Skating Championship on the frames.

Since 2003, the Rollerblade company has produced Dual Box frames under [[licence]] from Mogema and has specified Dual Box technology in their high-performance skate product lines. Today, following the dissolution of Mogema in 2006, Dual Box designer Diederik Hol's own company CadoMotus produces its own skating frames based on an evolution of the Dual Box tubular sidewall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8998">'''Fantasy wrestling''' is an umbrella term representing the genre of [[role-playing]] and statistics-based [[game]]s which are set in the world of professional wrestling. Several variants of Fantasy Wrestling exist which may be differentiated by the way they are transmitted (through websites, message boards, e-mail, postal mail, face-to-face, etc.), the method in which the storyline is determined, (via roleplay, "[[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angles]]", strategy- or statistics-based systems, etc.) and how the [[Schedule (workplace)|roster]] is composed (are characters created by the players, are real wrestlers "imported" into the game, etc.).

Fantasy wrestling's roots lie in the play-by-mail wrestling games often featured in professional wrestling magazines that became prominent in the mid-to-late 1980s during one of professional wrestling's boom periods. By the late 1980s, fantasy wrestling games had started to appear on the Internet. In the early 1990s, the advent of national bulletin board services like [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[AOL]], and [[Compuserve]] allowed players to use e-mail and bulletin boards to more easily trade information and post roleplays. As technology progressed and the [[internet]] evolved, fantasy wrestling enthusiasts took advantage, using websites and newsgroups to connect and build broader communities for gameplay.

==History and progression==

===Creation of character(s)===
In order to begin fantasy wrestling, one must create a custom character. Some people will elect to use pro-wrestlers over their own, custom characters; this can be either allowed or rejected by the administrator of the federation. Usually, one will decide the following: physical appearance (height, weight, sex; these can be copied through "renders" - images of pro-wrestlers - or through their imagination/CAW mechanics through wrestling games), moveset (style, signature moves, finishing moves, etc.), fan reaction (heel or face; booed or cheered), and entrance music. Once this is all decided, the character is named and the player can begin to promo in the federation. Some players create multiple characters, either for choice for playing or to freshen the experience/start new.

===Play-by-mail===
Early versions of the game began in the 1980s using play-by-mail formats.  Based on the moves and any strategies applied the adjudicator would then decide the outcome.  Play-by-mail leagues often included a 'pay to play' model where handlers paid a fee per match and/or 'strategy' applied.  The later expansion into email was a natural progression, often using the same mechanics as the pbm format.

===Internet email play===
In the late 1980s, e-wrestling got started on the Internet, played by email and often advertised via Usenet, including rec.games.pbm and rec.games.frp.&lt;ref&gt;There is a Usenet posting dating to Nov. 1990 advertising for a play by email wrestling league. https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.pbm/browse_thread/thread/858e739be2a9be36/7f8dd468379b5506?lnk=gst&amp;q=wrestling#7f8dd468379b5506| retrieved 6 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The early games followed the model of a simplified role-playing game with "combat systems" of varying complexity, resolved by the Federation Head, or "Fedhead."  The role-playing aspect was significant and the fast turn-around of email allowed for collaboration in the creation of "promos" and the formation of tag-teams and "stables" made up of multiple players.  The term e-wrestling was coined about this time, probably by Scott Baxter, since there were enough federations active to require a collective noun.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/totalprowrestling/home/summit-background| retrieved 17 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1989, there was enough activity for a dedicated Usenet group, rec.sports.pro-wrestling.fantasy, to be created.&lt;ref&gt;http://rspw.org/faq/999-funkymfuq.txt| retrieved 17 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Email play persisted, as was still common enough in 1995 to rate the occasional mention in annual reviews, although not always favourably.&lt;ref name="bestandworstof1994"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Best and Worst of 1994 and Predictions for '95 (extract)|url=http://www.neonshop.com/bio/iw/bwv6n1.htm|publisher=[[Internet Magazine|The Internet Magazine]]|year=1994|accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online bulletin boards===
Fantasy wrestling expanded in the early 1990s with the rise of nationwide message boards based on PRODIGY, AOL and Compuserve. Originally connected to message boards focused on professional and amateur wrestling, fantasy wrestling's popularity caused specific subforums to be created on PRODIGY's Wrestling BB and AOL's Grandstand. The games based on the online boards had some differences from the federations operating on the Internet via email and Usenet.  Many stat-based systems found ways to integrate roleplay as a factor into determining match winners, paralleling similar developments in some of the Internet email federations. Eventually, roleplay became the primary factor for many leagues.

===The Web===
As the previously isolated message board services began to connect to the Internet, the disparate communities began to overlap, and much of the activity began to migrate to the World Wide Web.  The use of roleplay and promos became a larger factor in the operation of many leagues and determining results.

The first websites featuring fantasy wrestling began to pop up as the World Wide Web started to develop.  Early examples include "The Wild World of e-Wrestling," which was devoted to the Internet-based games.&lt;ref&gt;"The Web Magazine" (print), October/November 1996, reviews, p. 68;an archived version of the site still exists, http://ewrestling.avigne.org&lt;/ref&gt; and “FW Central,” a site devoted to the PRODIGY-based fantasy wrestling community based on PRODIGY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where Did FW Come From?(extract)|url=http://fwrestling.com/whatis/EpEVupFpppUVXRNrTx.shtml|publisher=[[FWrestling.com]]|year=1998|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites offered new places for players to interact and expand the hobby, providing online news and resources.

As the web matured, so did sites devoted to the hobby. The various federations, which had been exclusively text-based, or nearly so, began to integrate Poser images of created wrestlers, animated videos, audio shows, and vlogs.

===Current===
Fantasy wrestling continues to evolve. Traditionally, most roleplays (referred to as "promos") revolved around more traditional pro-wrestling topics, focused on trash talking an opponent and hyping an upcoming match, although extensive storylines existed, and gag advertising was fairly common. Longer form roleplay has continued to gain in popularity, resulting in detailed stories and arcs.

However, roleplay is not the only form of fantasy wrestling currently available. There are also federations based around angles and booking, there are turn-based sites that allow you and an opponent to alternate between different parts of the match until a moderator decides who wins. Another niche is match-writing federations. Seen as one of the more challenging types, match-writing federations require you to write your match against your opponents and the winner's match is seen as canon. Stat or dice based federations continue to thrive, as well, sometimes deliberately harkening back to the earlier days of the hobby.

Another method of fantasy wrestling currently used is called "E-Fedding" (a slang term for E-Federations, internet groups that identify as fictional companies). Individuals roleplay with promos, written similar to a screenplay of a movie, and the moderators/administrators of the forum/group decide the winner(s) based on the promos written, storylines in play/building, along with other factors that may present themselves. On Facebook, several E-Federations can be found.

Some players have created social media accounts now to live out the lives of their characters in ways a typical roleplay could not show.

===Pro wrestling companies in fantasy wrestling===
In 2004, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] began its own fantasy wrestling game focused on selecting WWE Superstars as part of a team and receiving points based on their involvement on the WWE television shows.  WWE singled out "real wrestling" E-Feds who used the names and likenesses of WWE Superstars and began sending them cease-and-desist letters. WWE later disbanded its fantasy wrestling game.

Between 2005 and 2006, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] also operated their own fantasy wrestling game. The game operated from the promotion's message boards and was based on real wrestlers. The game never gained notoriety and was removed along with the message boards from the promotion's website in late 2006. In June 2011, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]] relaunched their fantasy wrestling game as a part of their Impact Wrestling campaign.

The '''Frisbie Pie Company''' was founded in 1871 by William Russell Frisbie in [[Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]], when he bought and renamed a branch of the Olds Baking Company. The company was located on Kossuth Street in Bridgeport's East Side, where nearby schoolchildren tossed the plates around and yelled "Frisbie" to alert others to avoid the spinning tins. The game the children played made its way to nearby college campuses.{{vague|reason= name 2 or more|date=May 2018}}{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== The "skilled person" theory of origin {{vague|reason=terminally vague: what does the theory say, &amp; when is it said to have originated, and how old is the first verifiable statement of the theory|date=May 2018}} ==
It has been noted{{by whom?|date=May 2018}}{{cn|date=May 2018}} that Frisbie supplied [[pies]] to many Connecticut retailers and restaurants, including the [[Yale University]] campus. Yale students discovered that the pie tins, inverted, had an [[airfoil]] shape which enabled them to be thrown, with practice, in various [[trajectory|trajectories]].

== Commercialization ==
The name Frisbie was picked up by [[Wham-O]], a [[California]]-based firm who had acquired the rights to the "Pluto Platter". As the pie tin was the same shape, it was discovered that children were already using the term for the flying disc and therefore a spelling amendment to avoid trademark infringement gave birth to the name [[Flying disc|Frisbee]].

== Frisbie pies today ==
The Bridgeport pie factory closed in 1958; Frisbie brand pies were bought out by [[Table Talk Pies]].&lt;ref name="table"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newengland.com/today/food/new-england-made/table-talk-pies/|title=Table Talk Pies|publisher=New England Today|author=Aimee Tucker|date=August 11, 2016|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Dan O’Connor, a Fairfield, [[Connecticut]] resident, Frisbee player, and historian acquired the license and distribution rights to the Frisbie Pie Co. He re-launched the company in November 2016 in Bridgeport, Connecticut and began distributing pies throughout the region in early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frisbiepie.com/our_story/&lt;/ref&gt; They sell pies based on the original Frisbie Pie Company recipe.

==In popular culture==

In ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'', [[Marty McFly]] ([[Michael J. Fox]]) while time-travelling to the Wild West, finds amusement in seeing the word "Frisbie" at the bottom of a pie plate.  He later throws the plate at a [[derringer]] held by outlaw [[Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen]] ([[Thomas F. Wilson]]), foiling his attempt to shoot [[Doctor Emmett Brown]] ([[Christopher Lloyd]]).

[[File:Harpastum romain.jpg|thumb|Harpastum, ancient Roman fresco]]
'''''Harpastum''''', also known as ''harpustum'', was a form of [[football|ball game]] played in the [[Roman Empire]]. The Romans also referred to it as the small ball game. The ball used was small (not as large as a ''[[follis (ball game)|follis]]'', ''paganica'', or [[football (ball)|football]]-sized ball) and hard, probably about the size and solidity of a [[softball#Ball|softball]]. The word ''harpastum'' is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἁρπαστόν (''harpaston''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dharpastum harpastum],
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; the neuter of ἁρπαστός (''harpastos''), "carried away",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%28rpasto%2Fs ἁρπαστός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from the verb ἁρπάζω (''harpazo''), "to seize, to snatch".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%28rpa%2Fzw ἁρπάζω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

This game was apparently a [[romanization (cultural)|romanized]] version of a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] game called ''phaininda'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: φαινίνδα&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfaini%2Fnda^ φαινίνδα],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;), or of another Greek game called [[episkyros|ἐπίσκυρος (''episkyros'')]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007 Edition: "In ancient Greece a game with elements of football, episkuros, or harpaston, was
played, and it had migrated to Rome as harpastum by the 2nd century BC".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2340903 ἐπίσκυρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Harris, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IJytuwyqKgcC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=episkuros&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=episkuros&amp;f=false ''Sport in Greece and Rome''], Cornell University Press, on Google books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel M. Kennell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u_eAP7wN5XUC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=episkuros&amp;lr=&amp;cd=15#v=onepage&amp;q=episkuros&amp;f=false ''The Gymnasium of Virtue: Education and Culture in Ancient Sparta''], The University of North Carolina Press, 1995, on Google books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/C0115986/origin.html Origin of Ball Games] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325214649/http://library.thinkquest.org/C0115986/origin.html |date=2010-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel B. Crowther, ''Sport in Ancient Times (Praeger Series on the Ancient World)'', Praeger Publishers, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It involved considerable speed, agility and physical exertion.

Little is known about the exact rules of the game, but sources indicate the game was a violent one with players often ending up on the ground. In [[Greece]], a spectator (of the Greek form of the game) once had his leg broken when he got caught in the middle of play.

==Writings related to ''harpastum''==
* [[Athenaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, [http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus1.html#14 "Deipnosophists", 1.14-15]&lt;/ref&gt; writes:
:"''Harpastum'', which used to be called ''phaininda'', is the game I like most of all. Great are the exertion and fatigue attendant upon contests of ball-playing, and violent twisting and turning of the neck. Hence [[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]], 'Damn it, what a pain in the neck I've got.' He describes the game thus: 'He seized the ball and passed it to a team-mate while dodging another and laughing. He pushed it out of the way of another. Another fellow player he raised to his feet. All the while the crowd resounded with shouts of Out of bounds, Too far, Right beside him, Over his head, On the ground, Up in the air, Too short, Pass it back in the scrum.'"

* [[Galen]], in On Exercise with the Small Ball,&lt;ref&gt;P.N.Singer, "Galen: Selected Works" (1997), pages 299-304&lt;/ref&gt; describes ''harpastum'' as:
:"better than wrestling or running because it exercises every part of the body, takes up little time, and costs nothing."; it was "profitable training in strategy", and could be "played with varying degrees of strenuousness."  Galen adds, "When, for example, people face each other, vigorously attempting to prevent each other from taking the space between, this exercise is a very heavy, vigorous one, involving much use of the hold by the neck, and many wrestling holds."

* An anonymous poet&lt;ref&gt;[[Laus Pisonis]],  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Laus_Pisonis/text*.html#178 verses 185-187] (translated by J.W. &amp; A.M.Duff).&lt;/ref&gt; praises the ball skills of Piso:
:"No less is your nimbleness, if it is your pleasure to return the flying ball, or recover it when falling to the ground, and by a surprising movement get it within bounds again in its flight. To watch such play the populace remains stockstill, and the whole crowd suddenly abandons its own games."

* [[Julius Pollux]]&lt;ref&gt;Julius Pollux, "Onomasticon", 9.105&lt;/ref&gt; includes ''harpastum'' and ''phaininda'' in a list of ball games:
:"Phaininda takes its name from Phaenides, who first invented it, or from ''phenakizein'' (to deceive),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfenaki%2Fzw φενακίζω],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; because they show the ball to one man and then throw to another, contrary to expectation.  It is likely that this is the same as the game with the small ball, which takes its name from ''harpazein'' (to snatch);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%28rpa%2Fzw ἁρπάζω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps one would call the game with the soft ball by the same name."

* [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] describes a ball game in one of his letters:&lt;ref&gt;Sidonius Apollinaris, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/sidonius_letters_05book5.htm#C17 "Letters", 5.17.7] (translated by [[Ormonde Maddock Dalton|O. M. Dalton]])&lt;/ref&gt;
:"And now the illustrious Filimatius sturdily flung himself into the squadrons of the players, like Virgil's hero, 'daring to set his hand to the task of youth'; he had been a splendid player himself in his youth.  But over and over again, he was forced from his position among the stationary players by the shock of some runner from the middle, and driven into the midfield, where the ball flew past him, or was thrown over his head; and he failed to intercept or parry it.  More than once he fell prone, and had to pick himself up from such collapses as best he could; naturally he was the first to withdraw from the stress of the  game."

The general impression from these descriptions is of a game quite similar to [[Rugby (sport)|rugby]]. Additional descriptions suggest a line was drawn in the dirt, and that the teams would endeavor to keep the ball behind their side of the line and prevent the opponents from reaching it. This seems rather like an "inverted" form of football. If the opponents had the ball on their side of the line, the objective would seem to be to get in and "pass" it to another player, or somehow get it back over the line. The ancient accounts of the game are not precise enough to enable the reconstruction the rules in any detail.

In an epigram, [[Martial]] makes reference to the dusty game of ''harpasta'' in reference to Atticus' preference for running as exercise:&lt;ref&gt;Martial, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book07.htm#C32 "Epigrams", 7.32]&lt;/ref&gt;
"No hand-ball (''pila''), no bladder-ball (''follis''), no feather-stuffed ball (''paganica'') makes you ready for the warm bath, nor the blunted sword-stroke upon the unarmed stump; nor do you stretch forth squared arms besmeared with oil, nor, darting to and fro, snatch the dusty scrimmage-ball (''harpasta''), but you run only by the clear Virgin water (the [[Aqua Virgo]] aqueduct)."

==Monuments==
[[File:Tombstone of Gaius Laberius.xcf|thumb|Tombstone of a boy with Harpastum ball ([[Sinj]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]])]]
In the [[Croatia]]n town of [[Sinj]], a Roman tombstone found in the ruins of the military camp [[Tilurium]], near the modern day [[Trilj]], shows a boy holding a ''harpastum'' ball in his hands. The ball that is shown on this monument has hexagonal and pentagonal patterns, similar to a modern-day football ([[soccer]]).

'''Huff Hall''' is a 4,050-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Champaign, Illinois]], United States. The arena opened in 1925 and was known as Huff Gymnasium until the 1990s. It is named after [[George Huff (baseball)|George Huff]], who was the school's athletic director from 1895 to 1935.

Huff Hall is home to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Fighting Illini]] [[volleyball]] and [[wrestling]] teams. Prior to the opening of [[Assembly Hall (Champaign)|Assembly Hall]] in 1963, it was home to the [[basketball]] team as well.

Currently Huff Hall is used for a variety of sporting events, including men's and women's gymnastics, men's wrestling, and women's volleyball.  At each athletic event banners are hung of past Illini heroes to remind the crowd of the rich tradition that Illini athletics have had.

Every March from 1926 to 1962, Huff Gymnasium played host to the state finals of the [[Illinois High School Association]] boys' basketball tournament.

Huff Hall also served as the home of the women's basketball team. Beginning in the 1970s and continuing through the mid-1990s, the team once again used Huff Hall for home games, as it struggled to fill up the Assembly Hall. Since 1997 the team has used the Assembly Hall exclusively, although it struggles with a losing record and to fill up the Assembly Hall.

From 1927 to 2002 Huff Hall was also home to a 25-yard swimming pool which served as the home of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign [[Underwater hockey|Underwater Hockey]] club and the University of Illinois Water Polo Club.  The pool had a consistent depth of 8 ft. which made it ideal for these activities.
[[File:Huff pool.jpg|thumb|Huff Hall Swimming Pool, circa 2001.]]
In addition to hosting athletic events, Huff Hall is also the home of the College of Applied Health Sciences.

==History==
Originally called the "New Gymnasium", Huff Hall was designed in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian-Revival]] Style by [[Charles A. Platt]] and University Architect James M. White. The building's architecture matches that of the Armory, Main Library, the Union, and other campus buildings. At the conclusion of its $772,000 construction in 1925, Huff Hall replaced the Military Drill Hall (now known as [[Kenney Gym and Kenney Gym Annex|Kenney Gym Annex]]) as the home for Fighting Illini basketball. The "New Gymnasium" was renamed Huff Gymnasium in 1937 following the longtime athletic director's passing.

A '''kip-up''' (also called a '''rising handspring''', '''kick-up''', '''Chinese get up''', '''kick-to-stand''', '''[[nip-up]]''', '''flip-up''', or '''carp skip-up''') is an acrobatic move in which a person transitions from a [[supine position|supine]], and less commonly, a [[prone position]], to a standing position. It is used in activities such as [[breakdancing]], [[gymnastics]], [[martial arts]], [[professional wrestling]], and [[freerunning]], and in [[action film]] fight sequences.

Not only does the kip-up require muscle activation and strength, but it also requires proper technique for successful completion. A practitioner must perform the preparation phase (initiation of movement until directly before flight), aerial phase (time spent in flight), and landing phase (time from touchdown of the feet to maintenance of balanced standing) using specific accelerations, angular velocities, and joint positions of the extremities in order to land on their feet.

==Execution and physics==
===From a supine position===
[[File:Kip-up.gif|thumb|Kip-up from supine position]]
The performer draws both legs (which may be either in extension or flexion) anterior to the chest, rotates back onto the shoulders, and optionally places hands on the floor proximal to the ears. The performer then moves from hip and knee flexion to hip and knee extension while elevating the body away from the floor. The performer creates force against the ground by pushing off with the hands and simultaneously moving the elbows from flexion to extension.

The leg motion during the thrust involves increasing the joint angle of the hip from flexion to extension. When the thrust is completed, the rotation of the legs with respect to the trunk is terminated and, as a result, the angular momentum of the legs is transferred to the entire body. The linear momentum of the thrust carries the body into the air feet first while the angular momentum causes the airborne body to rotate. The spine moves into greater lordosis so that with sufficient thrust, back curvature, and body rotation, the performer will land on the feet.

===From prone position===
With body face-down, the performer creates forces against the floor with fists or palms while kicking back the legs so as to develop momentum that carries the body into the air. The performer lands with the feet in contact with the floor, and knees in flexion.

==Variations==
{| class="wikitable"
|+Kinematic variations
!Name
!Description
|-
|Knee extension kip-up
|The distinguishing feature to this is that the knees remain in extension while they are brought to the chest. All other movements remain the same to the standard kip up. Keeping the knees in extension causes the inertial properties of the practitioner to change, thus making it more difficult to return to standing than if the individual's knees were in flexion. 
|-
|No hands kip-up
|This variation is considered more difficult because it generally requires more force to be exerted on the shoulders and cervical spine. A distinguishing feature of the [[Chinese martial arts|Wushu]] version is the change in hand positioning. The hands are placed directly superior to the knees as the legs are brought anterior and proximal to the chest. From there the cervical spine and shoulders create force into the ground in order to add extra velocity to the legs as they recoil back to land. Practically every variation of the original kip-up can be done without hands and springing up from the shoulders and cervical spine.
|-
|Prone kip-up
|With body face-down, the performer pushes against the floor with fists or palms while kicking back the legs so as to develop momentum that carries the body into the air. The performer lands in a [[squatting position]]. The feet may not be utilized. 
|-
|Rolling kip
|A kip-up executed from a push up (prone, knee extension, hip extension, shoulder flexion, palms on the floor, and toes on the floor, trunk and legs remain aerial while the hands and feet hold the individual for support) or kneeling position. The practitioner starts rotating their body toward the anterior, hips and knees move into flexion, while the hands move inferior toward the floor. The individual discontinues halfway through the movement and instead of rolling over to his or her feet, the legs are held back and proximal to the chest. This sets up the practitioner to create force against the ground and do a kip-up. 
|-
|Headspring
|Also known as "head kip", it is a move that consists of getting in a kneeling position (prone with knees in flexion, and head and knees contacting the floor) and going on the top of ones head. Thereafter, an individual creates force with their palms against the floor while simultaneously moving the elbows into extension. The individual continues to create force until the hands lift off of the ground. The legs move posterior through the air until a standing position is maintained.
|-
|Kip-up 180
|The difference between a normal kip-up and a kip-up 180 is the rotation added during the phase in which the individual is aerial. The 180 indicates a rotation of 180 degrees before the feet come in contact with the ground. This is a harder variation that works the same way as the kip-up 360.
|}

===Hop back variations===
Hop back variations all involve the practitioner starting in a standing position, possibly jumping in the air and rotating posterior in order to land on their shoulders/back. After maintaining the supine position the practitioner executes the standard kip up variation in order to return to their feet.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Name
!Description
|-
|Standard hop back to kip-up, or continuous kip-up
|The practitioner moves the knees into flexion as if sitting down on an imaginary chair. They then take flight and rotate towards the posterior. The hands are placed posterior and proximal to the back of the neck to protect the cervical spine from receiving damage. Once the body has landed on the shoulders and hands, the hips and knees move into flexion anterior to the chest and a standard kip-up is executed.
|-
|Rubber band
|The rubber band is a [[breakdancing]] move which consists of repeated kip-ups which do not go all the way to standing position (the knees never return to complete extension). A rubber band is more like a back [[Handspring (Gymnastics)|handspring]], except it requires a movement of slower velocity when lowering the thoracic and cervical spine to the ground to kip back up.

'''''Knockout''''' (also called '''''Born to Fight''''') is a 2011 Canadian-American [[List of sports films|sports]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Anne Wheeler]]. The film stars [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], and [[Daniel Magder]].

==Plot==
Dan Barnes (Steve Austin) is a former pro boxer who retired after growing weary of his violent existence. While Matthew learns how to box and stand up to his tormentors, one of whom is the school boxing champ (Jaren Brandt Bartlett), Dan's new found role as a teacher helps him come to terms with his tumultuous past. Throughout the film Matthew (Daniel Magder), is in a constant being bullied by Jaren, on various occasions Jaren and his friends targeted Matthew and would constantly do anything to get under his skin. Matthew had a passion for boxing, due to the fact that his grandfather was one of the top boxers at his earlier age. Matthew had troubles with his mom and step father accepting him to join the boxing club at school. Matthew had to argue back and forth with his family in order for his parent's to allow him to join the boxing club. Once he got accepted into the school boxing club, the first day he had to spar with his tormentor bully Jaren. As they sparred in the boxing rink, Jaren was very aggressive towards Matthew. Once the referee blew the whistle and said stop fighting, Matthew took a cheap shot at Jaren which led him to being kicked out of the boxing club on the first day. Dan the janitor saw the whole thing, and talked to Matthew, noticing Matthew was really upset about the entire situation. Dan then took the responsibility of helping Matthew achieve his boxing dream. Matthew trained, and did whatever it took to become the best he could be. With the help of his coach Dan, Matthew was able to train and become a better boxer. Throughout his training with Dan, Dan trained him both mentally and physically, and gave Matthew an opportunity to box his all time bully Jaren and gave him another opportunity to join back into the boxing club.

'''Michael Charles Leach''' (born March 9, 1961) is an American [[college football]] coach. He is the head coach of the [[Washington State Cougars football]] team. Previously, he was [[head coach]] of the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football]] team, leading the Red Raiders to winning seasons in every year of his tenure.

==Personal life==

Born to Frank and Sandra Leach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/573/000166075/|title=Mike Leach}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Susanville, California]], Mike Leach claims [[Cody, Wyoming]], as his hometown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=38792761|title=Mike Leach – MySpace profile |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119174116/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile |archivedate=November 19, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Cody High School before studying at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), where he closely followed the exploits of the [[BYU Cougars football]] team. The Cougars, guided by head coach [[LaVell Edwards]] and offensive coordinator [[Norm Chow]], played a pass-oriented offense, which was unique to college football at that time. Leach graduated in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in American studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footballscoop.com/archives/coach-august.htm Coach of the Month] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060531234534/http://www.footballscoop.com/archives/coach-august.htm |date=May 31, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Leach earned a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) from [[Pepperdine University School of Law]]. Leach is also one of the most prominent graduates of the [[United States Sports Academy]], from which he earned a Master's of Sports Science in Sports Coaching in 1988. Leach is married with four children. He was raised a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

Leach is atypical among [[NCAA Division I]] head football coaches in that he did not play [[American football|football]] at the college level. He is one of only four such coaches along with [[Paul Johnson (American football coach)|Paul Johnson]] at [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]], [[David Cutcliffe]] at [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke]], and [[Chad Morris]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Famous among fans for his fascination with 18th-century [[Golden Age of Piracy|pirates]] such as [[Edward Teach|Blackbeard]] and [[Calico Jack]], Leach has lectured his players on the history of pirates, and told them before games to "swing their swords." His office has been described as a museum of pirate paraphernalia.&lt;ref name="ESPNSchlabach"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&amp;id=3385098|title=Eccentric Leach ready to lead Red Raiders to ultimate treasure|author=Mark Schlabach|date=May 7, 2008|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt; In particular, Leach admires the [[teamwork]] exhibited by pirates: 

{{quote|Pirates function as a team. There were a lot of castes and classes in England at the time. But with pirates, it didn't matter if you were black, white, rich or poor. The object was to get a treasure. If the captain did a bad job, you could just overthrow him.|4=Mike Leach|5=&lt;ref name="ESPNSchlabach"/&gt;}}

Leach's affinity for pirates came to bear in a cameo he made on the TV series ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]''. In the show's fourth season, he portrays a "random loon" at a gas station who implores a despondent coach [[Eric Taylor (Friday Night Lights)|Eric Taylor]] to "swing your sword" and "find your inner pirate."&lt;ref name="grantland.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/43652/the-script-for-the-friday-night-lights-movie-is-almost-done-will-be-about-texas-tech%E2%80%99s-mike-leach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323194629/http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/43652/the-script-for-the-friday-night-lights-movie-is-almost-done-will-be-about-texas-tech%E2%80%99s-mike-leach |archivedate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leach spends time during each off-season learning as much as he can about various things that interest him. Aside from pirates, he has researched topics such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] leader [[Geronimo]], American pioneer [[Daniel Boone]], [[grizzly bear]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[whale]]s, and American artist [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt;

==Coaching career==

===Offensive scheme===
Leach is known for building potent offenses, directing passing-oriented teams that have broken school and NCAA records at [[Valdosta State Blazers football|Valdosta State]] and [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] where he was offensive coordinator under [[Hal Mumme]], developing their "[[Air raid offense|Air Raid Offense]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsok.com/ou-football-a-look-at-tts-genius/article/3322193|title=OU football: A look at TT's 'genius'|publisher=The Oklahoman|accessdate=November 15, 2008|date=November 15, 2008|authorlink=Jake Trotter|author=Trotter, Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] under head coach [[Bob Stoops]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsok.com/tech-unmasked/article/3324171?custom_click=lead_story_title|title=OU football: Tech unmasked?|work=The Oklahoman|accessdate=November 22, 2008|date=November 22, 2008 |author=Trotter, Jake|authorlink=Jake Trotter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]], where he became head coach in 2000. Leach's [[spread offense]] relies heavily on passing and he has seen several of his quarterbacks post NCAA records. At Kentucky he tutored prospect [[Tim Couch]] into a No. 1 [[NFL draft]] pick. At Oklahoma, [[Josh Heupel]] became an NFL draft pick following a year under Leach's tutelage.

Leach's tenure at Texas Tech produced most of the Red Raiders' [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football statistical leaders|school leaders]] in passing and receiving.

===Texas Tech===
{{main|Texas Tech Red Raiders football}}
The Leach-coached Red Raiders' best finishes came with three nine-win seasons in 2002, 2005, and [[2007 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|2007]] and an 11-win season in 2008. In 2002, Tech swept its in-state conference rivals [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]], [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]], and [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]] for the first time since 1997 and then defeated [[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]], 55–15, in the [[Champs Sports Bowl|Tangerine Bowl]]. It was the Red Raiders' first postseason win since 1995 when they beat the [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force Falcons]] in the [[Insight Bowl|Copper Bowl]]. In 2005, the Red Raiders opened their season with a 6–0 record, their best start since 1998. Leach built a strong passing offense at Tech, where the Red Raiders led the NCAA in passing yardage for four years in a row.

He inserted [[Kliff Kingsbury]] at quarterback for three years. Kingsbury broke the NCAA records for completions in a career. Kingsbury was succeeded at the position by [[B. J. Symons]], who produced the most passing yards in a season in NCAA history. [[Sonny Cumbie]] followed, leading the Red Raiders to an upset of the then-4th ranked [[California Golden Bears football|California]] in the [[Holiday Bowl]]. [[Cody Hodges]] succeeded Cumbie, and subsequently lead the NCAA in passing. [[Graham Harrell]], the first non-senior starting QB since Kingsbury, struggled early in the 2006 season. However, he showed steady improvement beginning with the game against [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]] and ended the season with a record-setting comeback victory over the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota Golden Gophers]]. Harrell also set NCAA records for passes completed in a season and career amongst others.

Under Mike Leach, Texas Tech was known for its high-scoring offense and come-from-behind victories. A 70–35 win over [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] in 2004 began with TCU leading 21–0 with eight minutes remaining in the second quarter. Before Tech's scoring drives started, a TCU defensive back was caught mouthing into a TV camera, "They aren't going to score." Later in the season, Texas Tech beat [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], 70–10, forcing the Cornhuskers to give up more points in a single game than they had before in their 114-year history. In 2005, the Red Raiders were losing to [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]], 13–10, late in the second quarter but won the game 59–20. Also in 2005, Tech had a halftime lead of 14–10 over Texas A&amp;M. By the end of the game, they increased the margin to 56–17. It was the Aggies' worst loss to the Red Raiders in the 64-year-old series.&lt;ref name=NYT2005&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/magazine/04coach.html?ei=5090&amp;en=c9f46201dc95f91d&amp;ex=1291352400&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Coach Leach Goes Deep, Very Deep – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=December 4, 2005 |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Leach was chosen to coach the South team during the 2007 inaugural Inta Juice [[North-South All-Star Classic]] game.

At the end of the 2008 season, Leach was 76–39 with the Red Raiders, including 7–2 against the Texas A&amp;M Aggies and 2–7 against the Texas Longhorns.&lt;ref&gt;Mack Brown Football.com&lt;/ref&gt; With a 5–4 record, he is the all-time winningest coach in postseason play in Tech football history. Leach was one of only sixteen active college football coaches who had  never had a losing season after he left Texas Tech. This was followed by a 3–9 season in his seminal year with Washington State. Of those, he is among nine who have been a head coach for at least five seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/090307/col_090307027.shtml |title=Texas Tech-SMU game facts 09/03/07 |publisher=LubbockOnline.com |date=September 3, 2007 |accessdate=October 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062948/http://lubbockonline.com/stories/090307/col_090307027.shtml |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Leach signed a three-year contract extension with Texas Tech that would pay him at least $2.5 million per year if he stayed in place through 2013. Leach's guaranteed compensation would have been $1.6 million in 2006, $1.65 million in 2007, $1.75 million in 2008, $1.85 million in 2009 and $2.15 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redraiders.com/stories/081206/foo_081206014.shtml ''The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal'': Leach to become $2 million man] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019171422/http://www.redraiders.com/stories/081206/foo_081206014.shtml |date=October 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007 Texas game controversy====
During his post-game [[press conference]] after the [[2007 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team#Texas|2007 game against Texas]], Leach used most of his time to rail against the officiating crew for what he felt were bad calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lubbockonline.net/blogs/RR_Don/index.php?entry=entry071110-233952 |title=More on Leach's Rail Against Officials |work=LubbockOnline.net |publisher=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |date=November 11, 2007 |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723193101/http://www.lubbockonline.net/blogs/RR_Don/index.php?entry=entry071110-233952 |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rolls over Tech"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.redraiders.com/updates/postgame_update1.shtml | archive-url=https://archive.is/20070503061029/http://www.redraiders.com/updates/postgame_update1.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 3, 2007 | title=Texas rolls over Tech | author=Williams, Don | work=RedRaiders.com | publisher=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He speculated that the officials may have favored Texas because the head official lived in Austin, because they were incompetent, or possibly because the conference wanted Texas to appear in a BCS bowl because of the increased appearance fees that such a bowl generates for the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/other/11/11/1111golden.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913134145/http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/other/11/11/1111golden.html |dead-url=yes | archive-date=September 13, 2012 | title=Leach goes off deep end with comments on officiating – Expect Tech coach to be fined, at least. | author=Golden, Cedric | work=Austin American-Statesman |publisher=Cox Enterprises | date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP rant"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/gen/ap/FBC_Texas_Tech_Leach_Rant.html |title=Texas Tech coach Leach rips officials after 59–43 loss to Texas | author=Vertuno, Jim | work=Austin American-Statesman |publisher=Cox Enterprises | date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=November 11, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Vertuno of the Associated Press wrote "Leach was upset officials disallowed two Tech touchdowns in the third quarter.

After [[2008 Big 12 Conference South Division 3-way tie controversy|much controversy]] about how the tie-breaker should be handled between Texas, Oklahoma, and Texas Tech fans, the Red Raiders ended up being left out of the BCS because of a rule that states only two teams from each conference could enter BCS play per season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/preview?gid=200901020086&amp;prov=ap|title=Texas Tech-Ole Miss Preview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahoma won the tie-breaker on account of their higher BCS ranking, ultimately losing to Florida in the national championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espndb.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=290080201&amp;confId=80|title=Florida rides Tebow, suffocating defense to another BCS title |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021193136/http://espndb.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=290080201&amp;confId=80|archivedate=October 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas Tech also ended up losing that year in the [[2009 Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] to Ole Miss 47–34, making Texas the only team of the three to win their bowl game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=290050251 |title=Longhorns squash Buckeyes' upset dreams with 26-yard score at :16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tech athletic director [[Gerald Myers]] had indicated that he would give a raise to Leach before Tech's bowl game, which he later negotiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/college_sports/story/1073669.html|title=Mike Leach visits Huskies, but Texas Tech to counter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leach and the university settled on a 5-year extension worth $12.7 million after months of negotiations over the clauses of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/big12/2009-02-19-texas-tech-leach_N.htm|title=Leach, Texas Tech reach agreement on new contract | work=USA Today | date=February 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009 season====
On October 31, 2009, after the Red Raiders' win over Kansas, Leach tied his predecessor Spike Dykes as the all-time winningest coach in Texas Tech's 85-year football history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/103109aad.html |title=Postgame Notes-TexasTech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21, 2009, Leach passed Dykes for first all-time on the school's wins list with a win over Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/112109aad.html|title=Texas Tech Postgame Notes|date=November 21, 2009|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firing===
On December 28, 2009, Leach was suspended indefinitely by [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] pending investigation of alleged inappropriate treatment of Adam James, son of former [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU]] and [[New England Patriots]] running back (and former [[ESPN]] college football analyst) [[Craig James (American football)|Craig James]]. On December 16, James suffered a [[concussion]]. He was examined the next day, and told not to practice that afternoon due to the concussion. According to a James family source, Leach ordered him to stand in the equipment room near the Raiders' practice facility.
According to the ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'', school officials claim they gave Leach an ultimatum to apologize to James in writing by December 28 or Leach would be suspended. His attorney, Ted Liggett, disputed the characterization of events as reported by the university and other news sources, and said that James had been treated reasonably in light of his condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redraiders.com/2009/12/29/leach-suspended Leach suspended after player alleges abuse]. [[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]], December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leach immediately sought an injunction that would allow him to coach in the [[2010 Alamo Bowl (January)|2010 Alamo Bowl]].  However, on December 30, Texas Tech fired Leach, calling his refusal to apologize to James "a defiant act of insubordination."  This was the day before Leach was reportedly owed an $800,000 tenure bonus and over $1,700,000 for contractual guaranteed income for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/06/01/report-tech-owes-leach-17-million-in-guaranteed-09-money/ |title=Report: Tech owes Leach $1.7 million in guaranteed '09 money &amp;#124; CollegeFootballTalk.com |publisher=Collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Texas Tech lawyers handed a termination letter to Liggett just minutes before the two sides were to appear in a Lubbock courtroom for a hearing.  Liggett was also told that Leach would not be allowed to coach in the Alamo Bowl regardless of how the hearing turned out.  School officials later said that other incidents had come to light during its investigation of Leach, but declined to elaborate.  Defensive coordinator [[Ruffin McNeill]] was named interim head coach and led the team during their appearance in the Alamo Bowl.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Texas Tech fires Leach | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls09/news/story?id=4781981

In a statement, Leach said that he believed the firing was motivated in part by simmering acrimony over the contract negotiations.  He also said he planned to sue Texas Tech for wrongful termination.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt;

On December 31, Leach spoke with ''[[The New York Times]]'' in his first interview since being fired from Texas Tech. He said that he did not know where James had been taken, having only ordered him taken "out of the light." He claimed the controversy stemmed from Craig James' constant lobbying for more playing time for his son, whom he characterized as lazy and feeling entitled.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Thayer; Thamel, Pete.

On January 8, 2010, Leach formally filed suit against Texas Tech for wrongful termination and other claims. He claimed that school officials not only fired him without cause, but issued defamatory statements in a willful attempt to keep him from being hired elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, Logan G.

In February 2012, The Texas Supreme Court rejected Leach's appeal without comment signifying their belief that Leach's lawsuit(s) were without merit. After that ruling, Texas Tech attorney Dicky Gregg stated "As we've said from the beginning, we were right on the law and the facts, and the (Texas) Supreme Court has just held that we were correct on the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Leach's appeal on lawsuit denied|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7585199/mike-leach-texas-supreme-court-denies-appeal-wrongful-termination-suit-vs-texas-tech|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]'' series creator [[Peter Berg]] has hinted that he has written a movie script for the characters from the TV series that is based on Leach's firing from Texas Tech.&lt;ref name="grantland.com"/&gt;

On August 6, Judge Sowder issued a summary judgement dismissing Leach's lawsuits against ESPN, Spaeth Communications, and Craig James.

===Post-Texas Tech===
In August 2010, Leach joined [[CBS College Sports Network]], where he worked as a color analyst with play-by-play announcer [[Roger Twibell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Blair|last=Kerkhoff|title=Leach, Twibell paired for broadcasts|date=August 16, 2010 |url=http://campuscorner.kansascity.com/node/1049|work=[[Kansas City Star]]|accessdate=August 16, 2010|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819051554/http://campuscorner.kansascity.com/node/1049|archivedate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leach was considered by many in the national media to be a candidate for the head coaching vacancies at University of Miami, University of Maryland, and University of Minnesota following the 2010 regular season. After at least two interviews at Maryland, he was considered the frontrunner for that job until the administration decided instead to hire [[Randy Edsall]] away from University of Connecticut. Leach was mentioned in connection with a number of other vacancies in head-coaching positions during 2011, including [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]], [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona]], [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]],  [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]], [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]], and [[Tulane Green Wave football|Tulane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/tulane/index.ssf/2011/11/former_coach_leach_says_hes_no.html|title=Mike Leach says he's not in serious talks with Tulane|first=Tammy|last=Nunez|date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=November 26, 2011|newspaper=Times-Picayune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/wildcatreport/2011/11/02/mike-leach-on-arizona-job-its-an-exciting-position/

===Washington State===
Leach agreed to terms with [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]] on November 30, 2011 and began coaching for the 2012 season. His five-year rollover contract made Leach the fourth-highest paid coach in the Pac-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://washingtonstate.scout.com/2/1134379.html|title=Mike Leach To Coach Washington State|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202023741/http://washingtonstate.scout.com/2/1134379.html|archivedate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 season====
Leach's first season was a controversial one.  Washington State was 3–9 overall and 1–8 in Pac-12 play; the lone wins were against FCS [[2012 Eastern Washington Eagles football team|Eastern Washington]], [[2012 UNLV Rebels football team|UNLV]], and an upset of rival [[2012 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] in the Apple Cup. At the end of the season, more allegations of player abuse erupted on November 10, 2012 when star wide receiver [[Marquess Wilson]] quit the team citing "physical, emotional and verbal abuse" by the coaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bellencourt|first=Andrew|title=Washington State player quits citing Mike Leach abuse |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/pac12/2012/11/10/marquess-wilson-washington-state-leaves-team-coaching-abuse/1697021/ |publisher=USA Today|accessdate=November 11, 2012|date=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately after the allegations were made, Washington State University President Elson Floyd issued a statement indicating that he had requested investigations into the alleged incident(s) from both the WSU Athletic Department and the Pac-12 Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Withers|first=Bud|title=WSU president wants probe of football program|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/sports/2019659656_wsuinquiry12m.html|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The investigations determined that the claims made against Leach were without merit, and Wilson later recanted the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marquess Wilson recants accusations against Mike Leach and Washington State's staff |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/marquess-wilson-recants-accusations-against-mike-leach-washington-172000214--ncaaf.html |publisher=Yahoo!

====2013 season====
In 2013, Leach led WSU to a 6–6 regular season that had the Cougars Bowl eligible for the first time since 2003. The Cougars were led on offense by [[Connor Halliday]], who set school and conference records for passing. The Cougars defeated the [[University of Southern California]] Trojans, Southern Utah, The Idaho Vandals, The California Golden Bears, Arizona Wildcats, and the Utah Utes for a 4–5 conference record. The Cougars were invited to the [[New Mexico Bowl]] where they dropped a close game to the [[Colorado State Rams]] 48–45 after leading for much of the game. Leading by 16 points with under three minutes to play, the Colorado State Rams mounted an all-time great comeback, winning with a field goal as time expired in regulation.  The Cougars led the nation in passing offense and total offense and Leach was awarded a pay raise for the Cougars 2013 performance.

====2014 season====
The 2014 season saw the Cougars regress back to a 3–9 record. The Cougars defeated Portland State 59–21, Utah 28–27, and Oregon State 39–32.

====2015 season====
In 2015, the Cougars had their breakthrough season of the Leach era with a 9–4 overall, 6–3 Pac-12 record. The Cougars were invited to the Sun Bowl where they beat Miami (FL) 20–14. This was the best Cougar record since the 2003 team went 10–3.

====2016 season====

The Cougars began the season 0-2, but rallied off 8 consecutive wins before dropping their final two games.  The success of their season, led by Luke Falk at quarterback, landed them in the Holiday Bowl where they lost to Minnesota 17–12. They finished 7–2 in the Pac-12, with an overall record of 8–5 for 2016. Notable wins occurred against Oregon and #15 Stanford. The 2016 season was the Cougars best finish in Pac-12 conference play since the 2003.

====2017 season====

Washington State finished 6-3 in the Pac-12 and 9-4 overall.  They were invited to the Holiday Bowl where they lost to Michigan State 42-17.

====2018 season====

Leach recruited graduate transfer [[Gardner Minshew]] at quarterback in time for the 2018 season and it paid big dividends. The Cougars won a school record-tying 10 games, the first time they had won that many in the regular season since 2002. They also surged as high as seventh in major polling. The Cougars went into the [[Apple Cup]] with a chance to clinch the Pac-12 North title and a shot at the Rose Bowl, but lost to rival Washington 28-15.

====Obama video controversy====

In June 2018, from his [[Twitter]] account, Leach retweeted a doctored hoax video of [[Barack Obama]]'s speech, produced by a [[conspiracy theory]] website and giving the appearance of Obama saying the opposite of what he actually meant. In the tweet Leach invited his followers to share their thoughts about the video, and he then spent several hours arguing with the critics of the video.

The '''Peace and Friendship Stadium''', commonly known by its acronym '''SEF''' ({{lang-el|Στάδιο Ειρήνης και Φιλίας}}, transliterated as ''Stadio Eirinis kai Filias''), is a multi-purpose [[indoor arena]] that is located in [[Piraeus]], on the coastal zone of [[Attica (region)|Attica]], [[Greece]]. The arena is mostly known for being the home to [[EuroLeague]] team [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], and is the central venue of the [[Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex]]. It opened in 1985.

The arena complex also contains a 942-seat [[amphitheater]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sef-stadium.gr/el/infrastructure/conference/melina-merkouri FACILITIES Places Exhibitions / Conferences - Melina Mercouri.]&lt;/ref&gt; a weight training room, a full practice facility, three auxiliary courts that house the Olympiacos youth clubs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympiacosbc.gr/en/the-academy-en/the-facilities.html The facilities.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Olympiacos team office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympiacosbc.gr/en/management-en/olympiacos-bc-hq-en.html Olympiacos BC HQ.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Peace and Friendship Stadium opened in 1985,&lt;ref name=mondo/&gt; and its construction cost was €25,000,000 in 1983 prices. It was designed by the architectural firm "Thymios Papagiannis and Associates". The arena is built opposite to the [[Karaiskakis Stadium]] in [[Piraeus]], located in the western end of the [[Phaleron Bay]], in the coastal zone of [[Attica (region)|Attica]]. It was inaugurated on February 16, 1985, at the first Panhellenic Athletics Indoor Championship, and hosted the [[1985 European Athletics Indoor Championships]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sef-stadium.gr/el/about-sef/stadium-history History] {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was designed and operated for a dual use as a ice hockey rink and as basketball stadium. The first [[Greek Ice Hockey Championship]] was held in the stadium in 1989. The operation of the skating rink was stopped for the use of other sports.

In 1991, the arena won the Golden Award from IAKS, the [[International Association for Sports and Leisure Facilities]].&lt;ref name=mondo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaziomondo.com/page_progetto.cfm?id_progetto=50|title=Peace and Friendship Stadium|publisher=Mondo Spazio|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1991–92 season, the Peace and Friendship Stadium has been the home court to [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] and [[EuroLeague]] professional basketball club [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]]. The arena was closed from April 2002, to early 2004, for renovation works, at a total cost of €7,300,000, and hosted the [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|indoor volleyball]] tournament during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf 2004 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; During the period that the arena was closed for renovations, Olympiacos played at the [[Glyfada Makis Liougas Sportshall]], during the [[2001–02 Euroleague|2001–02]] season, and at the [[Korydallos Sports Hall]], during the [[2002–03 Euroleague|2002–03]] and [[2003–04 Euroleague|2003–04]] seasons.&lt;ref name=move/&gt;

The arena's total capacity varies, depending on the collapsible bleachers used in the lower level, besides its 11,640 permanent seating in the mid and upper levels,&lt;ref name="The Peace and Friendship Stadium"&gt;[http://www.olympiacosbc.gr/en/team-en/peace-friendship-arena.html The Peace and Friendship Stadium.]&lt;/ref&gt; with additional temporary seating, it currently seats a total of 12,000 people for basketball games.&lt;ref name="fosonline.gr"&gt;[https://www.fosonline.gr/volleyball/eyropi/article/5287/etoimo-to-sef-gia-ton-teliko-olympiakos-ravena-pics Έτοιμο το ΣΕΦ για τον τελικό Ολυμπιακός-Ραβένα(pics) {{el icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redaroume.gr"&gt;[http://redaroume.gr/%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%83%CE%B5%CF%86-%CE%BC%CE%B5-%CF%84%CE%B7-%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B2%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%80%CE%B1/ Στο ΣΕΦ με τη Ραβένα για την Κούπα! {{el icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ballineurope.com"&gt;[http://ballineurope.com/euroleague-2016-17-preview-olympiacos-piraeus-5415/ Arena: Peace and Friendship Stadium aka the SEF (11,600/12,000).]&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace and Friendship Stadium seats up to 14,776 for basketball games, with all the bleachers in use.&lt;ref name=move&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadia.gr/news/news-13-10-2001.html|title=Olympiacos B.C. move|publisher=stadia.gr|date=October 13, 2001|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RZD Arena''' ({{lang-ru|«РЖД Арена»}}) is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].  It is the home stadium of [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] and was the home ground of the [[Russia national football team|Russian National Team]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches.  The stadium was reconstructed in 2002 and holds 27,320 people, all seated. The reconstruction of the stadium was funded by the [[Ministry of Transport (Russia)|Russian Transportation Ministry]] at a cost of $150–170 million.

===Stalinets===
In 1935, at the site where the Lokomotiv Stadium resides today, an electric workers union decided to build a stadium which was named "Stalinets" or "Stalinist Stadium". At that time Stalinets held about 30,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmos.ru/photo/view/2891|title=Стадион «Сталинец», будущий «Локомотив»|website=PastVu|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of Lokomotiv Stadium===
After holding several key matches and establishing itself as a symbol of football in Moscow, Stalinets was demolished to make way for a more modern stadium. Thus, Lokomotiv stadium was built. It was opened on 17 August 1966 with a capacity of 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fclm.ru/ru/publications/news/13508 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805182133/http://www.fclm.ru/ru/publications/news/13508 |archive-date=2017-08-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the mid-90's the capacity of the stadium was reduced by 6,000 to 24,000, as the wooden benches were replaced by plastic seats.

The inaugural match played at the '''Lokomotiv stadium''' was between [[Lokomotiv Moscow]] and [[Dynamo Kiev]]. As years rolled on, Lokomotiv held several important matches such as [[Russia National Football Team|Russian National team]] home matches, Lokomotiv matches and others. The stadium also played host to a European Cup Qualifier between [[FC Spartak Moscow]] and [[Swiss]] club [[FC Sion]]. The match finished 2-2; however, the Swiss club then forced UEFA to measure the posts for compliance with international standards. Indeed, the size of the posts were shown to infringe international standards. Eventually, UEFA ordered a replay, which [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak]] won 5-1.

=== Reconstruction ===
Despite the fact that Lokomotiv Stadium was still of good quality, the [[Lokomotiv Moscow]] board felt that a new stadium would be the best option. The construction was backed by the Russian Transport Ministry. The new stadium held its first match on July 5, 2002 when [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] welcomed [[FC Uralan Elista|Uralan Elista]]. The home team won 1-0 and the first official goal scored at the new stadium was an own goal by [[Dmitry Semochko]].

On 5 August 2017, [[Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv]] announced that the stadium has been renamed to '''RZD Arena''' following a deal with [[Russian Railways]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fclm.ru/ru/publications/news/15968|title=Заявление президента ФК «Локомотив» - ФК Локомотив|website=Fclm.ru|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:LOKOSTADIUMPLAN.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stadium Plan]]
'''Lokomotiv''' was designed solely for football matches and thus has no running tracks. The pitch, which is 104mx68m, is surrounded by two-tiered four all-seater stands, the North Stand, the South Stand, the East Stand and the West Stand. The South Stand is home to the Lokomotiv Moscow ultras. On the other hand, travelling fans generally reside in the North Stand. All the stands are covered by a roof, by thus protecting the fans from the Russian harsh weather elements. The total areas of the glass roof is 20,000 square metres. A unique characteristic of the stadium are the VIP-Boxes found in between the upper and lower tiers of all the stands, with one of them being even a restaurant. Furthermore, the stadium comprises other three VIP-sectors, one of them being of soft-seats. Altogether they total to 974 VIP-seats. Furthermore, there are 156 seats available for the press. Thus in all the stadium holds 30,000 people. Moreover, beneath the stands one can find a fitness centre, a bowling club and also the offices of both the club and the fan club.

Moreover, beside the stadium one can find the [[MSA Lokomotiv|Minor Sports Arena Lokomotiv]].

==Concerts==
[[Depeche Mode]] performed at the stadium on June 22, 2013 during their [[Delta Machine Tour]], in front of a sold out crowd of 27,886 people.

==History==

{{Empty section|date=April 2014}}

==First Men's Basketball Home Big 12 Win==
Prior to the TCU vs. KU men’s basketball game on February 6, 2013 the TCU men’s basketball team was 9-12 (0-8 Big 12) with their last win being Sunday, December 30 against Mississippi Valley State.  [[University of Kansas]] was 19-2 prior to playing TCU, coming off a loss at home, in Lawrence, Kansas, against the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]].

The TCU men's basketball team took out the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball]] team, ranked #5 at the time, in the Daniel–Meyer Coliseum on February 6, 2013. The game was scheduled to tip off at 8:00 pm CT and air on ESPNU. It took the Jayhawks over seven minutes from the start of the game to make a field goal. The score going into halftime was 22-13 in TCU’s favor. Kansas head coach [[Bill Self]] sounded furious with the play of his Kansas Basketball team, as he said in a post game interview, “It was the worst team that Kansas ever put on the floor, since Dr. Naismith was there.” &lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. "ESPN Men's Basketball: Recap." ESPN, 6 Feb. 2013. Web. 10 Mar. 2014. http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330372628.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior guard Garlon Green, whose brother is Gerald Green, scored a team high with 20 points on his 100th consecutive game for the Horned Frogs. The final score was 62-55 in TCU’s favor, and as soon as time expired, TCU students and fans rushed the court to celebrate their first Big 12 victory. The highest ranked squad TCU had beaten prior to the game was #6 Oklahoma on December 27, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Senior guard Garlon Green, whose brother is [[Gerald Green]], scored a team high with 20 points on his 100th consecutive game for the Horned Frogs. The final score was 62-55 in TCU’s favor, and as soon as time expired, TCU students and fans rushed the court to celebrate their first Big 12 victory. The highest ranked squad TCU had beaten prior to the game was #6 Oklahoma on December 27, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel–Meyer Coliseum had a record crowd of 7,412 fans on February 6, which broke the previous record of 7,267 from December 1, 2003 against Kansas. In the 2014 game against Kansas, there were 7,494 fans in attendance, breaking the record set on February 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. "ESPN Men's Basketball." ESPN, 25 Jan. 2014. Web. 10 Mar. 2014. http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400498369&lt;/ref&gt; TCU lost in the team’s second Big 12 game against the University of Kansas at the DMC 69-91. [[Andrew Wiggins]] scored a game high 27 against the Horned Frogs.

==First Women's Basketball Home Big 12 Win==
The TCU Lady Frogs faced the Oklahoma State women’s basketball team on February 20, 2013. TCU came into the game with a 7-17 record (0-13 in the Big 12).&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. "ESPNW Women's Basketball." ESPN, n.d. Web. 19 March 2014. http://espn.go.com/womens-college-basketball/team/schedule/_/id/2628/year/2013/tcu-horned-frogs.&lt;/ref&gt; The game tipped off at 8:00 pm ET, with TCU still winless in Big 12 women’s basketball, but the TCU Lady Frogs scored 11 unanswered points to beat OSU 64-63 and win their first Big 12 game. Delisa Gross scored the game winner with 1:04 left to put the Frogs up by one. The Oklahoma State Cowgirls women’s basketball team was ranked #23 going into the game.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. "ESPNW Women's Basketball: Recap." ESPN, 20 Feb. 2013. Web. 30 March 2014. http://espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=330512628.&lt;/ref&gt;

TCU went on to beat the [[Iowa State Cyclones]] 61-58 in the Daniel–Meyer Coliseum on Saturday, March 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. "ESPNW Women's Basketball." ESPN, 2 March 2013. Web. 15 March 2014. http://espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=330612628.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cyclones were ranked #23 at the time of the game, with a record of 20-6 (11-5 in the Big 12). Zahna Medley scored 18 points for the Lady Frogs to help secure a win over Iowa State. Delisa Ross contributed 15 points of her own for the Lady Frogs on her final game in the DMC as a TCU Horned Frog. This was the second, and last, Big 12 win for the Lady Frogs of the 2012-13 basketball season.

==Renovations==
The DMC has a four-panel LED scoreboard, along with LED sideline boards. The cost of the new screens came to be $1.5 million. The screens are used during the games to show the live feed, highlights, and company promotions.

On April 16, 2013, the university announced plans for a $45 million renovation to the arena. The project transformed the 53-year-old facility into a modern arena, with widened concourses, additional bathrooms and upgraded concessions. The proposed facade remade the outdated exterior of the venue into something resembling the brick and art deco architecture of the neighboring Amon G. Carter Stadium. The court was lowered several feet to accommodate additional rows of seating that would fill in the large curves currently on either side of the court, giving fans courtside seating and much closer views of the action. Among the many additions and upgrades were a courtside club on the floor level for season ticket holders and new offices for TCU athletic staff coaches of sports such as soccer, tennis and golf. New locker rooms for both TCU and visiting teams and team meeting rooms were added. TCU was forced to play at another area arena during the 2014-15 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TCU Has $45 Million Plan to Remake Daniel-Meyer Coliseum|first=Stefan|last=Stevenson|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/04/16/4780206/tcu-has-45-million-plan-to-remake.html|newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=April 16, 2013|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was formally approved by the university on November 7, 2013, with construction beginning in March 2014. There are fences around the arena with outdoor print of the future design of the Daniel–Meyer Coliseum. The new arena's renovation is scheduled for completion in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TCU Set to ‘Transform’ 52-Year-Old Daniel-Meyer Coliseum|first=Stefan|last=Stevenson|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/11/09/5320969/tcu-set-to-transform-52-year-old.html|newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=November 9, 2013|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the renovations, the university agreed to play games at Wilkerson-Greines Activity Center, a 4,759-seat arena adjacent to [[Tarrant County College]] and owned by the Fort Worth Independent School District and located approximately 15 minutes southeast of campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/college/article3855093.html|title=Fort Worth ISD agrees to host TCU basketball at Wilkerson-Greines in 2014-15|newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=April 24, 2014|accessdate=February 5, 2015|first=Ryan|last=Osbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2015, TCU revised the total cost of the renovations to over $80 million, and announced the facility would be renamed as Ed &amp; Rae Schollmaier Arena for the project's lead donors. The renovated facility was re-opened on December 20, 2015 when the men's basketball team played Abilene Christian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9815">'''The Cricket Society''' is a charitable organisation founded in 1945 as the '''Society of Cricket Statisticians''' at [[Great Scotland Yard]], [[London]]. It has grown steadily to be the largest body of its kind in the cricket world.   The Cricket Society now has more than 2000 members in the United Kingdom and the cricket playing countries of the world. Its current President is [[John Barclay (cricketer)|John Barclay]].

==Activities==
The '''Wetherall Awards''' began in 1967 and presently continue in four separate categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketsociety.com/wetherall_awards.html|title=The Cricket Society - Awards|publisher=The Cricket Society|accessdate=26 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018032610/http://cricketsociety.com/wetherall_awards.html|archivedate=18 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Leading all-rounder in English first-class game
*Leading Young All-Rounder in the English First-Class Game
*Leading all-rounder in [[Schools cricket]]
*Leading all-rounder at [[Repton School]]

The Cricket Society instigated an Annual Book of the Year Award in 1970 that now, in association with the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]], hosts an Awards Evening in the [[Long Room]] at [[Lord's Pavilion|Lord's]] each spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketsociety.com/awards/the-cricket-society-mcc-book-of-the-year/|title=The Cricket Society/MCC Book of the Year|publisher=The Cricket Society|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the winter months, The Society holds monthly meetings, featuring famous names from cricket, for members and guests at the [[Royal Overseas League]] in Park Place, London SW1.

Through its charitable trust, it raises money to coach underprivileged children in the skills of [[cricket]]. They link up with various organisations such as the [[Arundel Castle]]  Cricket Foundation to achieve these aims.

The Society has a cricket team which plays at a number of venues each season. It also holds monthly meetings for the members in London (as detailed above), [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] at which invited speakers address the audience. These activities are held to maintain an interest in cricket and both inform and entertain its members and guests through the off-season.

The Cricket Society publishes a journal, bi-annually and a regular news bulletin, 8 times per year, for its subscribed membership.

The Society commissioned [[E.W. Padwick]] to compile a comprehensive bibliography of cricket literature under the title ''A Bibliography of Cricket''. The first edition, published in 1977 by the [[Library Association (UK)|Library Association]] had 8,294 entries.&lt;ref&gt;''Barclay's World of Cricket - 2nd Edition'', 1980, [[Collins Publishers]], {{ISBN|0-00-216349-7}}, p588&lt;/ref&gt; A revised edition, published in 1984, extended this to over 10,000 entries ({{ISBN|978-0853659020}}). A second volume, published in 1991 as ''Padwick's Bibliography of Cricket, Volume 2'', was compiled by Stephen Eley and Peter Griffiths and covers works published between 1980 and 1990 ({{ISBN|978-0853655282}}).

==The Cricket Society/MCC Book of the Year==
The Cricket Society began naming a book of the year in 1970. Since 2009 the award has been made in partnership with [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cricket Society/MCC Book of the Year |url=http://www.cricketsociety.com/awards/the-cricket-society-mcc-book-of-the-year/ |website=The Cricket Society |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It carries a prize of £3000, which is presented at an awards evening each spring in the Long Room at [[Lord's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book of the Year shortlist announced |url=https://www.lords.org/news/2018/march/book-of-the-year-shortlist-announced/ |website=MCC |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the [[sports journalism|Sportswriters']] Association of [[Western Australia]] proposed a '''Western Australian Hall of Champions''' to honour past athletes from the state who had made a significant impact in their sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wais.org.au/other/hallofchampions.php|title=WA Hall of Champions History|work=WAIS|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Government of Western Australia asked the then-recently created [[Western Australian Institute of Sport]] (WAIS) to develop the concept and the [[Hall of fame|Hall of Champions]] was inaugurated by [[Keith Wilson (Western Australian politician)|Keith Wilson]], the Minister for Sport and Recreation, on 19 August 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Western Australian Hall of Champions'' handbook (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen foundation inductees were made in 1985 and since then several new inductees are made each year at a dinner hosted by WAIS.  The award is the highest honour that can be accorded a West Australian sportsperson.&lt;ref name="legend"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/wa/stories/s2071492.htm|title=WA Legend of Sport|date=26 October 2007|accessdate=2007-11-11|work=ABC Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The induction criteria are:
*The person must have achieved the highest level of open competition in his/her sport;
*The person must be product of the Western Australian sporting system, or have established their reputation while living in and representing Western Australia;
*The person must been retired from open competition for at least five years.

The selection committee currently comprises: Lawrence Apps, Ken Cassellas, [[Liz Chetkovich]], Alan East, David Hatt, [[Glenn Mitchell (sports broadcaster)|Glenn Mitchell]] and Pam O'Connell.  Former members were [[Wally Foreman]] and [[George Grljusich]].

The award is separate from the [[Western Australian Sports Star of the Year]] which is given to currently competing sportspeople.

'''Wolverhampton Racecourse''' is a [[thoroughbred horse racing]] venue located in [[Wolverhampton]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[England]]. The track was the first to be [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlit]] in Britain and often holds meetings in the evening.

The course has a [[Synthetic racetrack surfaces for horse racing|Tapeta]] surface, and is one mile (1,609 m) in circumference, with left-hand turns — giving it greater commonality with most racetracks found in the [[United States]] than with other venues in the UK.

==History==
There has been a racecourse in Wolverhampton since 1825, in what is now the West Park, where the Park Road follows the line of the track. This was sold to the Corporation in 1878 and, after a gap of nine years, a new course was formed at Dunstall Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/millennium/1900/1925-1949/1927.html |title=Our Century 1925-1949 |publisher=Expressandstar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1993 the course was re-vamped with floodlights and a new all-weather [[Fibresand]] track that ran alongside the turf track. A hotel, new grandstand, restaurant and executive boxes were also built at this time. In 1999 the course was bought from private ownership by [[Arena Leisure]]. In 2004 the Fibresand and turf tracks were replaced with a single Polytrack surface, as well as refurbishment of the hotel and conference facilities. Since that time the course has only held flat all weather races. In 2014, citing dissatisfaction with the degradation of the Polytrack surface, the course was closed for several months while a new artificial surface, Tapeta, was laid down. The course reopened on 11 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/horse-racing/news/12426/9417644/thumbs-up-for-tapeta |title=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course has been granted planning permission by Wolverhampton City Council, to expand the hotel from 54 to 170 bedrooms and to tarmac the over-spill car park. The £26 million project also includes plans for a casino which would create the first [[racino]] in the UK.
